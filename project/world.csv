Police are trying to piece together how the gunshots were fired and what led to the shooting as the two students were considered ""inseparable"" by friends.The incident occurred around 10.30am at RCI Vidya Vihar hostel in Knowledge Park-III. The two students - Deepak Kumar (22) from Andhra Pradesh and Devansh Chauhan (23) from Agra - were both enrolled in the PGDM programme at Birla Institute of Management Technology (Bimtech). They were, however, not roommates. It was in Kumar's room where the shots were fired. Chauhan is in Kailash hospital. His condition is critical.Both bullets came from the same licensed revolver, which was fully loaded and belonged to Chauhan's father Surender Singh Chauhan, who retired as a circle officer in UP STF on Aug 31. Chauhan, who went home last Saturday to attend his father's farewell party, is believed to have sneaked the gun out when he left for his hostel on Tuesday morning itself.Chauhan had reached the hostel barely a couple of hours before the incident.""He had come home on Saturday to attend our father's retirement party. On Tuesday morning, he returned to college. He left home around 5.30am and reached his hostel by 9am. It was around noon that we received a call from the college authorities about the firing incident,"" said Shivang Chaurasia, Chauhan's brother who lives in Gurgaon.Surender Chauhan told TOI he kept the gun in a cupboard in his room. ""It was only a few hours since Chauhan left home. I didn't realise that the gun was missing too.""At Vidya Vihar hostel, it was a guard who first sensed something amiss after hearing faint groans from the locked room. Unable to get any response, he alerted the hostel warden. After repeated attempts to open the door failed, some staff members climbed to the rear balcony with a ladder and peered inside. What they saw was shocking. Inside, Kumar lay dead. Chauhan was groaning in pain.According to the chief medical officer of Kailash hospital, the bullet lodged in Kumar's head was fired from the right side. ""The boy suffered brain death,"" he said.In Chauhan's case too, the bullet was fired from the right. ""The revolver had six bullets. Two were used, four remain. No official complaint has been filed yet,"" the investigating officer said.A police team arrived at the hostel around 11.30am and secured the area. Forensic experts recovered the revolver, four live cartridges, and two bullet shells. They also seized the students' mobile phones, laptops, and other personal belongings from the room.While the exact sequence of events is unclear, police are examining the possibility of a confrontation between the two students.Bimtech did not respond to requests for a comment.",Deepak Kumar (22) from Andhra Pradesh and Devansh Chauhan (23) from Agra were both enrolled in the PGDM programme at Birla Institute of Management Technology (Bimtech) It was in Kumar's room where the shots were fired.

FBI’s Kash Patel Stumbles After Charlie Kirk’s Assassination; ‘Botched’ Updates Trigger Backlash

Who is Andrew Bailey? 'I am not...'



Kash Patel's series of wrong moves in the Charlie Kirk incident



Patel announced that the suspect was in custody hours after Charlie Kirk was shot. Then he took back his statement and said the suspect was released. They actually got a wrong person. A day later, Patel flew from New York to Utah to join a press conference where he was seen with an FBI jacket like a field agent. It was called unprecedented for the FBI director. Despite his presence, which delayed the Thursday press conference, Patel did not speak as the suspect was not identified. Patel was present at the press conference where they announced the arrest of Tyler Robinson, but Utah Governor Spencer Cox spoke about the details of how he was caught, not Patel.





Amid speculations that Kash Patel should be removed as the FBI director, insider chatter claims that former Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, who will be sworn in as a new deputy director of the FBI in a power-sharing role with Dan Bongino, will eventually replace Patel. Patel is believed to be on thin ice, though President Donald Trump praised his leadership and the FBI's investigation into the assassination of Charlie Kirk.Inside reports claim Trump is not thrilled with Patel, and the wrong arrest in connection with the Charlie Kirk murder was not the only reason. Patel's fallout with Pam Bondi over the Epstein case is where it all began. The White House, Bondi and her deputy, Todd Blanche, have no confidence in Kash Patel and Pam Bondi, in particular, cannot stand Patel, Fox reported, citing a source.Andrew Bailey was reportedly Trump's original choice to lead the FBI. As he will be sworn in today as the co-deputy director, there is speculation that he is a part of a broader plan that will place him in the position of Patel. Bailey issued a statement to Fox clarifying that he is not replacing Patel. ""Any suggestion that I was brought in to replace anyone in leadership at the FBI or spin my appointment into a sign of division, is simply false - I am honored to serve the FBI and Department of Justice as we work together to keep our nation safe,"" he said.",Andrew Bailey will be sworn in as a new deputy director of the FBI in a power- sharing role with Dan Bongino.

The US vice president JD Vance announced that he will host 'The Charlie Kirk Show' from the White House on Monday to pay tribute to his slain friend.The show is scheduled to air at noon, less than a week after Kirk was assassinated during a college campus visit in Utah.Vance and Kirk had been close friends for many years, long before Vance entered politics. In a letter to Kirk shared after his death at Utah Valley University, Vance reflected on their time together.He noted that Kirk was one of the first people he contacted when he decided to run for the US Senate in 2021 and that Kirk helped connect him with others who could support his campaign, including Donald Trump Jr.Vance described Kirk as one of his most dedicated advocates over the years, who even helped guide the selection process that ultimately led to Vance becoming vice-president.The vice president said he first learned about Kirk being shot through group messages with friends and government officials while in a meeting in the West Wing.“God didn’t answer those prayers, and that’s OK. He had other plans. And now that Charlie is in heaven, I’ll ask him to talk to big man directly on behalf of his family, his friends, and the country he loved so dearly,” Vance wrote.Vance had also accompanied Kirk’s body during transport from Utah to his home state of Arizona.Images from the flight show Kirk’s wife, Erika, dressed in black and holding their two young children, walking hand-in-hand with second lady Usha Vance. The vice president and uniformed service members helped carry the flag-draped casket onto the plane.Earlier, on Wednesday, Vance paid tribute to Kirk on social media, calling him “a true friend” and a major influence in his rise in national politics. Kirk, the conservative activist who was shot at Utah Valley University, helped shape Vance’s path from a MAGA outsider to the vice presidency.“Charlie was fascinated by ideas and always willing to learn and change his mind,” Vance wrote. “Like me, he was skeptical of Donald Trump in 2016. Like me, he came to see President Trump as the only figure capable of moving American politics away from the globalism that had dominated for our entire lives. When others were right, he learned from them. When he was right — as he usually was — he was generous.”Vance said Kirk was crucial to his 2022 Senate campaign in Ohio, assisting with strategy, fundraising, and grassroots connections. “He introduced me to some of the people who would run my campaign and also to Donald Trump Jr., who took a call from me because Charlie asked,” he wrote.Kirk's children also remained deeply involved with Vance’s family and they often spent time together.“Our kids, especially our oldest, struggled with the attention and the constant presence of the protective detail. I felt this acute sense of guilt that I had conscripted my kids into this life without getting their permission. And Charlie was constantly calling and texting, checking on our family and offering guidance and prayers,” Vance said.","US vice president JD Vance will host 'The Charlie Kirk Show' from the White House on Monday.

Fight or Die: Why Elon Musk cannot pull a 'Trump' in the UK; even with Tommy Robinson,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/fight-or-die-why-elon-musk-cannot-pull-a-trump-in-the-uk-even-with-tommy-robinson/articleshow/123900670.cms,"FULL SPEECH: Elon Musk’s EXPLOSIVE Message To Americans After Kirk’s Murder | ‘Fight Back Or Die’

Britain, the Petulant Empire



Ricky Gervais - Armageddon - ''I love Illegal Immigrants'' Joke

A Tired Democracy in Labour’s Hands



Hello, Mr Robinson...

Musk’s Words



“You either fight back or you die.”

“Whether you choose violence or not, violence is coming to you.”

“There’s got to be a dissolution of Parliament and a new vote held.”

“My appeal is to British common sense… if this continues, that violence is going to come to you.”

“There’s a massive incentive on the left to import voters. If they can’t convince their nation to vote for them, they’re going to import people from other nations to vote for them. It’s a strategy that will succeed if it is not stopped.”

“The left is the party of murder and celebrating murder. That’s who we’re dealing with here.”

These weren’t tweets carefully crafted for plausible deniability. They were frontal assaults, wrapped in conspiracies about Labour’s immigration policies. The claim that Starmer’s government is “importing voters” was pure nativist paranoia, but it resonated with a crowd already convinced Britain is being “replaced.”

Musk’s Grooming Gang Crusade



The Scandal



Can Musk Do a Trump in Britain?



Reason One: Britain Has No Trump.

Reason Two: The System Is Built to Block Insurgents.

The Call Is Coming from Inside the House







There’s a certain irony that anti-immigration rhetoric is the strongest political currency in Britain right now. The same Britain that once sent its ships across the seven seas, peddling opium in Canton, sugar in the Caribbean, and civilisation as a side hustle everywhere else. The same Britain that built its fortunes by traversing the globe and telling everyone else to play by its rules. And now, when denizens of those very lands show up at Heathrow with legal visas or rubber dinghies, the keepers of empire clutch their pearls. Suddenly, movement across borders is an existential threat. Apparently it was fine when the British moved, but not when the world moves back in their direction.This is the backdrop Elon Musk has parachuted into, with the grace of a meme lord and the menace of a billionaire arsonist. He has found Britain’s sorest nerve—immigration—and jabbed it with the same glee he once reserved for short-sellers. Grooming gangs, free speech, Tommy Robinson: Musk has taken Britain’s ugliest domestic quarrels and broadcast them to the world, not because he loves Britain, but because chaos is his native language.Which brings us to the real question: can Musk pull a Trump in Great Britain? Can the man who helped bend American democracy around a reality-TV demagogue do the same to a parliamentary system that prides itself on being too boring to collapse?The first obstacle to answering that question is Britain itself.This is a country that never got over the loss of its empire. The sun may have set on the colonies, but the nostalgia shines brighter than the July drizzle. Britain still teaches itself a Disneyfied history of Magna Carta, Churchill, and “We Stood Alone,” while airbrushing out the famine in Bengal or the fact that “Rule Britannia” was basically the anthem of global piracy.That unresolved imperial hangover feeds directly into today’s immigration hysteria. Britain acts shocked—shocked!—that people from South Asia, Africa, and the Middle East want to live in the country that once ruled them, looted their resources, and redrew their borders. Immigration isn’t an accident of globalisation. It is the boomerang of empire. Britain threw its weight around the world for centuries, and now the world is throwing itself back.Yet the political class behaves as if migration is an alien invasion. The Tories reduced it to a three-word slogan—“Stop the Boats.” Labour promises competence while quietly nudging right. Even when net migration is fuelling universities, health care, and the economy, the debate remains stuck in Daily Mail hysteria. Britain is the empire that colonised the world and now wants a refund.The July 2024 general election delivered Keir Starmer’s Labour a crushing majority, ending fourteen years of Conservative decline. By all logic, Labour should now enjoy stability: a solid parliamentary bloc, five years to govern, the Tories reduced to rubble. Instead, within a year, Starmer’s government already looks exhausted. Approval ratings have tanked, and the party that promised change has settled into the bureaucratic boredom of managing decline.The problems aren’t minor. Immigration is once again the public’s number one concern. The NHS is stretched past breaking. Public services creak under austerity’s hangover. And despite a commanding Commons majority, Labour already looks like it’s governing on probation.This is what makes Musk’s interventions sting. He isn’t yelling at a Conservative government limping toward defeat. He’s taunting a Labour government barely out of its honeymoon, daring it to explain why things already feel worse. Britain wanted an alternative. Labour won on that promise. But in the absence of tangible change, Musk’s circus suddenly feels more relevant than Starmer’s carefully ironed suits.On a September weekend in London, Tommy Robinson’s “Unite the Kingdom” march drew an estimated 110,000–150,000 people—by far one of the largest demonstrations Britain has seen in decades. Organisers billed it as a “free speech” event, but the message was anti-immigration to its core. Placards warned of civil war, chants called out the Labour government, and the police reported twenty-six officers injured after clashes, with four seriously hurt. Twenty-five people were arrested.Counter-protests by Stand Up to Racism brought about 5,000 people to nearby streets. The state deployed roughly 1,000 officers to keep the sides apart. Bottles flew, fists landed, and Britain’s fractured immigration debate spilled onto its pavements.And then, beamed in via screen, came Elon Musk.Musk’s intervention was not subtle. His speech hit hard, framed less as commentary and more as a call to arms:This was not Musk’s first British foray. Earlier in 2025 he went on a posting spree about grooming gangs, accusing Labour of complicity, calling for officials to be hanged, and demanding Tommy Robinson’s release. It was sensationalism masquerading as concern, and it put Labour on the defensive over cases that long predate Starmer’s premiership.The irony is glaring: Musk isn’t solving Britain’s problems; he’s exploiting them. His attacks make Labour look like the party that ignores children, immigration, and crime, at precisely the moment when Starmer most needs credibility.Every political earthquake in Britain shakes around immigration, but nowhere has the betrayal felt sharper than in the grooming gang scandals. For years, local councils and police forces looked the other way as gangs — disproportionately made up of men of Pakistani origin — preyed on vulnerable white working-class girls in towns like Rotherham, Rochdale, and Telford. Reports show officials feared being branded racist, so they let crimes fester. Britain, in its obsession with maintaining the illusion of multicultural harmony, sacrificed its own daughters.That failure is more than just a tragedy. It is an open wound in the national psyche, one that populists can reopen at will. When Elon Musk tweets about grooming gangs, he isn’t importing an American culture war — he’s plunging his finger into Britain’s self-inflicted scar tissue.And here’s the irony: after decades of cowardice, the state now swings its authority in the opposite direction. Instead of facing its failures honestly, it arrests ordinary citizens for posting memes. What it once ignored in fear of offending a community, it now over-polices to signal virtue. The result is a political climate where genuine crimes were overlooked, but digital jokes are prosecuted. It is this inversion of justice — tolerance for predators, intolerance for speech — that makes Musk’s interventions resonate with a public that feels doubly betrayed.So, can Musk pull a Trump here? Structurally, no. Legally, no. Culturally, unlikely. Donald Trump was a perfect storm: a reality-TV celebrity with name recognition, a tabloid appetite for scandal, and the instinct to speak to grievances no one else would touch. He didn’t just use social media; he embodied the fantasy of smashing politics with a sledgehammer. Britain, for all its flirtations with Boris Johnson, has no such figure right now. Johnson tried to cosplay Trump, but collapsed under the weight of wine bottles and WhatsApps. Nigel Farage talks the talk but has never had the charisma or machinery to seize Downing Street. Tommy Robinson can fill the streets, but not the ballot box. Until Britain produces a true populist figure who can straddle celebrity, grievance, and electoral appeal, Musk has no avatar to ride to power.Trump won because the US Electoral College makes it possible to lose the popular vote and still become president. America’s system rewards geographic quirks: scrape narrow wins in the right swing states and you can govern a country that mostly didn’t vote for you. Britain doesn’t work like that. First-past-the-post is brutal, but it’s also stabilising: it punishes insurgent parties whose votes are spread thin. Reform UK can poll 20–30% nationally and still end up with a handful of seats. There are no Super PACs to supercharge campaigns, no billionaire chequebooks, and no presidential race for Musk to hijack with memes. Unless Britain’s system itself cracks, Musk’s meddling hits a ceiling.The real danger isn’t Musk. It’s Britain. Musk is a spark, but Britain is the tinder. The country never confronted its imperial past, never built an honest immigration policy, and never looked inwards.Labour governs with a giant majority but already looks fragile. Reform UK surges not because Musk tweets, but because mainstream politics refuses to say what everyone knows: Britain is a post-imperial nation that still thinks it’s a superpower, a migrant-dependent economy that still thinks it can close borders, and a democracy that is impervious to the challenges it faces.If Britain spirals into Trump-style populism, it won’t be because of Elon Musk. It will be because Britain created the conditions for a Musk surrogate to thrive. He doesn’t need to pull a Trump here. Britain is already halfway down that road—Musk just makes the journey louder, meme-ier, and more humiliating.",Elon Musk sent a series of tweets after the murder of Labour MP Chris Kirk. He called for a dissolution of Parliament and a new vote to be held. Musk said: ‘The left is the party of murder and celebrating murder. That’s who we’re dealing with here’,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123900988,imgsize-3245701,width-400,resizemode-4/fight-back-or-die.jpg"

Four people from the St Theresa Point First nation were killed on Saturday evening, when a float plane went down near Makepeace Lake, about 40 kilometres south of the northeastern Manitoba community.The crash was reported around 6:45 pm, prompting police, military search-and-rescue teams and a chartered helicopter to rush to the remote area, Manitoba RCMP said on Sunday, CBC news reported.The victims include a 49-year-old man, two women aged 50, and a 53-year-old man, who were all pronounced dead at the site.All four were residents of St Theresa Point First Nation and were travelling to Makepeace Lake, roughly 425 kilometres northeast of Winnipeg, close to the Manitoba-Ontario border, CBC news reported.Investigators said that the de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver float plane had been scheduled to touch down on the lake, but instead crashed on land just north of it.The 20-year-old pilot survived with serious but non-life-threatening injuries and was treated overnight by rescue teams at the crash site.CBC News confirmed the aircraft belonged to Alair air taxi service, based in St Theresa Point, though the company declined to comment.RCMP spokesperson Sgt Paul Manaigre said community leaders were informed of the victims’ identities, though their names have not been released publicly.Chief Raymond Flett described the tragedy as a devastating blow to the community, noting the victims were two couples, each with young children. He said they had been on a weekend trip to their traditional hunting grounds.The Assembly of Manitoba chiefs and grand chief Kyra Wilson also expressed sorrow in a Facebook statement, offering their “deepest condolences.”“We grieve with you. The loss of community members in such a sudden and devastating way is felt across all our Nations. In this time of heartbreak, we stand with St. Theresa Point, holding up the families and community in prayer, love, and strength,” CBC news quoted.As investigations by RCMP and the Transportation Safety Board of Canada continue, Flett said the community is desperate for answers. “Our condolences are going out to those family members, friends, community members. It’s going to be tough,” Manaigre added.“Hopefully we can get some information to them very soon as to exactly what happened.”","Four people from the St Theresa Point First nation were killed on Saturday evening, when a float plane went down near Makepeace Lake.

US secretary of state Marco Rubio on Monday backed Qatar’s role in mediating the Gaza conflict, a week after Israeli strikes on the Gulf nation targeting Hamas.Rubio, who discussed Qatar with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem, is set to visit Qatar on Tuesday, on his way to London where he will join US President Donald Trump on a state visit.Rubio and Trump have both criticised last week’s strike on Qatar, which is home to the largest American air base in the Middle East.Speaking after his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Rubio said the focus was now on the way forward.“We are focused on what happens now, what happens next, what role can Qatar play possibly in reaching an outcome” to bring the conflict to an end, he explained.“We're going to continue to encourage Qatar to play a constructive role in that regard,” Rubio told reporters at a joint press conference Netanyahu.Qatar’s emir on Monday accused Israel of neglecting the plight of its hostages in Gaza, saying it was instead focused on making the territory “no longer livable.”Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani made the remarks at the opening of a summit in Doha, convened after Israel’s strike. Israel, however, has maintained that its war aims include both the return of all hostages and the defeat of Hamas.Meanwhile, Netanyahu defended the strike, saying it was directed against Hamas, the group responsible for the October 7, 2023 assault on Israel.“We assume full responsibility for it because we believe that terrorists should not be given a haven and the people who planned the worst massacre of the Jewish people since the Holocaust cannot have immunity,” he said.He compared Israel’s actions to US military campaigns following the September 11 2001 attacks, including operations in Afghanistan and the 2011 mission in Pakistan that killed Osama bin Laden.“Those countries that are condemning Israel today did not come and say, well, what a terrible thing was done, the sovereignty of Pakistan was violated, the sovereignty of Afghanistan was violated,” the Israeli PM argued.“You don't have such a sovereignty when you are effectively giving a base to terrorists,” he added.Prior to the October 7 attack, both Israel and the United States had encouraged Qatar’s involvement in Gaza, including its transfer of millions of dollars to Hamas in an attempt to keep the territory stable.With its strong relationship with Washington, Qatar was viewed by officials in both countries as a convenient channel to keep watch on Hamas and deter the group from drawing closer to Iran, whose clerical leadership openly backs it.","US Secretary of State Marco Rubio backs Qatar's role in mediating the Gaza conflict.

Phil Mickelson makes a stand against toxic rhetoric



The assassination of Charlie Kirk has ignited a fierce debate online. Targeting the disturbing reactions to the news, Phil Mickelson, an American Golf legend took a strong stand, condemning the support given to Charlie Kirk’s shooter and his actions. His statement on X has now even received a powerful backing from the tech billionaire Elon Musk .

He wasn’t just heartbroken by the loss of life but even horrified by the online commentary segment. The golfer ensured to specifically call out ones who applauded the alleged shooter’s appalling behavior. He described it as a revealing look at the dangerous extremism form.Mickelson further stated that this incident has shaken up his belief in people. He tried to emphasize that it is morally reprehensible. His central hope, which was clearly stated online, was that one’s spreading hate would face consequences for all of their words, in this tragedy’s wake.The entire condemnation resonated well with Elon Musk. The billionaire directly added a powerful declaration quoting Mickelson’s post. In it, Musk said, “They will be held accountable.” The simple statement coming from Musk served as an amplification of the entire message shared by Mickelson. It signalled that the toxic rhetoric will not be tolerated on X.Criticism shared by Mickelson on X went beyond just some mere disapproval of this entire violent act.

As per him, it is not a valid political opinion or free speech exercise.The perspective did strike a chord with many. There are many others on X who have spoken up against people celebrating Charlie Kirk’s death. It has brought in broad conversation about moral lines that one must not cross, even within political disagreement. The unanimous message was clear: to justify violence is completely unacceptable, and those who will do so will have to face consequences.","Golf legend Phil Mickelson took a strong stand on X, condemning the support given to Charlie Kirk’s shooter and his actions.

BHOPAL: Arvind Parihar, the man who shot his wife dead in broad daylight outside Gwalior’s Roop Singh Cricket Stadium on September 12, showed no remorse, police said.Investigators reported that Arvind Parihar smiled during questioning and told officers he felt “free from daily quarrels” after the killing. A police officer involved in the interrogation told TOI that Parihar even said he regretted only that she did not die in front of him and claimed he would have felt relieved if she had.Police stated that Parihar accused his wife Nandini Kewat of taking his money and cars while maintaining relationships with other men. Officers said the trigger was a video Nandini had posted four days earlier on Facebook, celebrating boyfriend Ankush Pathak’s birthday. Investigators said seeing the video enraged him and pushed him over the edge.On the day of the murder, Nandini had visited the SP’s office with Ankush to complain against her husband. As they were returning, Parihar intercepted them near the stadium and fired five rounds from a .315 bore pistol. Four bullets struck Nandini. She was rushed to hospital but declared dead on arrival. Police said that even as Nandini lay injured, Arvind went live on Facebook holding his pistol and claimed his wife had filed false cases at the behest of her boyfriend.Investigators said Parihar, a resident of Putthi village in Pichore, had met Nandini at a beauty parlour in 2022. They connected on social media, exchanged comments, and married in 2023, despite knowing each other’s past—Nandini was divorced, and Arvind was already married with two children. The marriage soured quickly, with both accusing each other of infidelity and publicly trading insults on social media.Police added that Arvind comes from a farming family with 60 bighas of land, two brothers, and a wife and children who live with his parents in Dabra. He once attempted to contest a district panchayat seat but withdrew. After the murder, his first wife declined to comment.Nandini’s post-mortem was conducted on September 13. Her father Brijmohan Kewat initially refused to claim the body, saying her in-laws should take it, but Arvind’s family refused. Nandini’s friend Ankush offered to take the body, but police refused under protocol, handing it to her father after persuasion. Officials said Arvind remains in police remand until September 15 as investigations continue into his criminal history.",Arvind Parihar shot his wife dead in broad daylight outside Gwalior’s Roop Singh Cricket Stadium on September 12.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on Monday issued a stern warning following the brutal beheading of an Indian-origin man, Chandra Mouli Nagamallaiah, in Dallas, Texas.The agency highlighted the risks posed by criminal illegal immigrants and warned that those entering the US illegally could be deported to third countries, including Eswatini, Uganda and South Sudan.In a post on X, DHS described the killing as ‘vile’ and ‘completely preventable,’ stating that the 37-year-old Cuban national, Yordanis Cobos-Martinez, should not have been released into the US by former President Joe Biden ’s administration after Cuba refused to take him back.""This vile monster beheaded a man in front of his wife and child and proceeded to kick the victims’ head on the ground. This gruesome, savage slaying of a victim at a motel by Yordanis Cobos-Martinez was completely preventable if this criminal illegal alien was not released into our country by the Biden Administration since Cuba would not take him back,"" the department wrote.DHS warned that criminal illegal aliens are being removed to third countries, saying that President Donald Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem are no longer allowing dangerous offenders to remain indefinitely in the US."" If you come to our country illegally, you could end up in Eswatini, Uganda, South Sudan, or CECOT,"" the post read.The horrific incident occurred Wednesday morning at the Downtown Suites Motel in Dallas, where 50-year-old motel manager Chandra Mouli Nagamallaiah was brutally attacked and beheaded by his co-worker, Yordanis Cobos-Martinez.Surveillance footage and witness accounts revealed that Cobos-Martinez chased Nagamallaiah across the motel premises, striking him with a machete in front of his wife and young son.According to witnesses, the attack began after an argument over a broken washing machine. Nagamallaiah’s family attempted to intervene, but the suspect continued the assault. Police reported that Cobos-Martinez took the victim’s cell phone and key card during the attack, ultimately severing his head, which he then kicked into the parking lot before placing it in a dumpster.Dallas Fire-Rescue arrived as Cobos-Martinez walked away from the scene carrying the bloodied machete. He was promptly taken into custody by Dallas police and admitted to the killing in an interview with authorities.In response to the attack, President Trump condemned the killing as “terrible” and criticized the Biden administration for being “soft on illegal immigrant criminals.”In a post on Truth Social, Trump said Cobos-Martinez “was released back into our Homeland under incompetent Joe Biden because Cuba did not want such an evil person in their Country.” He added that the suspect had a criminal record, including charges of child sex abuse, grand theft auto and false imprisonment.Trump emphasized that “time for being soft on these Illegal Immigrant Criminals is OVER” under his watch and pledged that Cobos-Martinez would be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, including first-degree murder charges.He also praised Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, Attorney General Pam Bondi and other administration officials for their efforts in “making America safe again.”The beheading has sparked nationwide outrage and renewed debate over US immigration policies, particularly the handling of criminal illegal immigrants who are released into the country when other nations refuse to accept them. immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials described the attack as “unthinkable”.","The Department of Homeland Security issued a stern warning following the brutal beheading of an Indian-origin man, Chandra Mouli Nagamallaiah, in Dallas, Texas.

Nepal interim government: PM Sushila Karki unveils new cabinet; Kulman Ghising among new ministers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/nepal-interim-government-pm-sushila-karki-unveils-new-cabinet-kulman-ghising-among-new-ministers/articleshow/123897567.cms,"Sushila Karki Expands Nepal's Interim Cabinet, Inducts Reformist Trio Ghising, Aryal, Khanal

Poll Do you support the idea of using social media platforms for political activism? Yes, it's crucial for democracy. No, it can lead to chaos.





Nepal’s interim prime minister has announced her first cabinet appointments, in a move to stabilise the country after violent youth-led demonstrations forced the previous government out.At a ceremony held outdoors beside the torched presidential office, President Ram Chandra Paudel swore in three senior ministers on Monday in an event that was carried live on television.Among the new ministers, lawyer Om Prakash Aryal, recognised for his work on corruption, governance and human rights, will lead the home, law, justice and parliamentary affairs portfolio.Kulman Ghising, who is credited for ending years of crippling power cuts as head of the Nepal Electricity Authority, will oversee energy, infrastructure, transport and urban development, AFP reported.The former finance secretary Rameshwor Khanal, a renowned economist, takes charge of the finance ministry, confronting unemployment that affects one in five Nepalis aged 15 to 24.According to World Bank data, the country’s GDP per capita stands at only $1,447. Sushila Karki , the 73-year-old former chief justice now serving as prime minister, faces the task of steering the country towards elections in March while addressing calls for clean governance.The crisis began on September 8, when a ban on social media set off mass demonstrations that tapped into years of economic frustration. Crowds torched parliament and other government buildings as anger spread, in scenes not seen since the end of the civil war and abolition of the monarchy in 2008.Government figures put the death toll at 72 over just two days, with another 191 still in hospital, as per an AFP report.Karki’s elevation followed behind-the-scenes talks led by army chief General Ashok Raj Sigdel and President Paudel, who also engaged with “Gen Z” activists. Thousands of young protesters had used Discord to push her candidacy.She admitted on Sunday that she had “not wished” to take the post, but that her “name was brought from the streets”.Karki pledged her administration would work “according to the thinking of the Gen Z generation”, saying young people wanted “the end of corruption, good governance and economic equality”.","Interim PM Sushila Karki swore in three new ministers on Monday.

Moscow Warning: Medvedev Says NATO Action On Drones Would Trigger War With Russia





US President Donald Trump said on Monday that a face-to-face meeting between Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, is difficult, citing personal hostility between the two leaders.""The hatred between Zelenskyy and Putin is unfathomable, they hate each other so much they can't breathe,"" Trump told reporters.He added that the “hatred” between Zelenskyy and Putin will eventually compel him to be involved personally and “do all the talking.”Trump also reiterated his claim of halting seven wars but noted that the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict has proven to be difficult to resolve.US President Donald Trump said last week that his patience with Putin is “running out fast,” during an interview with Fox News. His comments came after the Kremlin announced that peace talks between Russia and Ukraine are currently on “pause.”""But it does take two to tango... When Putin wants to do it, Zelenskyy didn't. When Zelenskyy wanted to do it, Putin didn't... We're going to have to come down very, very strong,"" Trump said.Trump has launched an aggressive diplomatic push, including hosting Putin in Alaska, in an effort to broker a deal.Three rounds of direct peace talks in Istanbul have so far achieved little beyond major prisoner exchanges between the warring countries.Despite efforts to stall the aggression, Moscow has continued its offensive and ongoing aerial bombardments.Cluster munitions have killed or injured over 1,200 civilians in Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, the Cluster Munition Coalition (CMC) reported on Monday, highlighting “troubling setbacks” in global efforts to eliminate the weapons. Ukraine now has the highest recorded annual cluster munition casualties worldwide.Meanwhile, Moscow continues to demand that Ukraine cede the entire Donbas region, parts of which it already occupies, while Kyiv has rejected territorial concessions and called for European troops to serve as peacekeepers, a proposal Russia considers unacceptable.On the other hand, a Ukrainian military intelligence source claimed responsibility on Sunday for two weekend attacks on Russia’s railway system, which derailed a train and killed three Russian officers.","US President Donald Trump said on Monday that a face-to-face meeting between Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, is difficult.

FULL SPEECH: Elon Musk’s EXPLOSIVE Message To Americans After Kirk’s Murder | ‘Fight Back Or Die’





UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s office on Monday criticised US tech billionaire Elon Musk for using what it described as ""dangerous and inflammatory language"" during a televised speech at one of the UK’s largest far-right protests.About 150,000 people joined the London protest on Saturday, organised by activist Tommy Robinson under the banner ""Unite the Kingdom.""In his address, Musk called for Britain’s parliament to be dissolved and for Starmer’s Labour government to be replaced. He also told the crowd that ""violence is coming"" and that ""you either fight back or you die.""Starmer’s spokesperson said: ""The UK is a fair, tolerant and decent country, and so the last thing the British people want is dangerous and inflammatory language, which threatens violence and intimidation on our streets.""Protesters marched over Westminster Bridge and gathered near Downing Street, where speakers included far-right figures from Europe and North America.UK home secretary Shabana Mahmood also condemned the protest, which saw violent clashes, and referred to Musk as a ""hostile billionaire"" for urging people to fight against Britain’s democracy.Speaking in the House of Commons, Mahmood said 26 police officers were injured and 24 protesters arrested during the demonstration.She added that while many protesters exercised their right to protest, ""some turned on the brave police officers who were there to keep the peace.""She continued: ""Those violent thugs will face the full force of the law, but those who turn to violence on Saturday do not represent who this country really is. When a foreign billionaire calls on our citizens to fight against our ancient democracy, I know this is met by the vast majority with a shake of the head. That is because we are, in truth, a tolerant country. And yes, we are a diverse one too. You can be English with roots here that stretch back 1,000 years. But you can also be English and look like me.""Mahmood repeated Starmer’s earlier message that the St George’s Cross and Union Jack flags are ""symbols of unity"" and should not be used to divide people.""The words that were used at the weekend are abhorrent and I know that the vast majority of people in this country will feel the same way; whether you're a hostile state or a hostile foreign billionaire, no one gets to mess with British democracy,” she added.Starmer had said on Sunday: ""Britain is a nation proudly built on tolerance, diversity and respect. Our flag represents our diverse country and we will never surrender it to those that use it as a symbol of violence, fear and division.""At the protest, Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, claimed that UK courts had put the rights of undocumented migrants above those of the ""local community."" He cited a Court of Appeal ruling that overturned an injunction stopping asylum seekers from being housed at the Bell Hotel in Essex.""They told the world that Somalians, Afghans, Pakistanis, all of them, their rights supersede yours — the British public, the people that built this nation,"" he told the crowd.Robinson’s supporters later threw objects at anti-racism counter-protesters as both groups faced off on Whitehall in central London.","UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s office criticised US tech billionaire Elon Musk for using what it described as ""dangerous and inflammatory language"" Musk called for Britain's parliament to be dissolved and for Starmer's Labour government to be replaced.

US President Donald Trump on Monday suggested that the suspect in the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk was “radicalized over the internet” and that his political radicalization was “on the left.”Trump said the 22-year-old suspect, Tyler Robinson, appeared to have had a stable upbringing and was a great student.“It looks like he became radicalized over the internet, and it seems like he has wonderful parents, born in a wonderful neighborhood, smart guy, great boards, great marks, great student. Then something happened to him over a fairly short period of time,” he said.Trump described Robinson as having been influenced by leftist ideology, though he did not provide specific details, as reported by CNN.“He’s a left. A lot of problems with the left, and they get protected, and they shouldn’t be protected,” the US President said, later clarifying that this was his personal view. “By the way, when I say that, that’s my opinion. I think he was radicalized online based on what they’re saying.”Robinson, a trade-school student from Utah, was arrested in connection with Kirk’s killing, which occurred on September 10 at a Turning Point USA event at Utah Valley University in Orem.Robinson allegedly fired a fatal shot at Kirk from a rooftop approximately 200 yards away and was taken into custody two days later following a tip from a family member.Utah Governor Spencer Cox, who oversaw the case, told The Wall Street Journal that investigators found Robinson’s political leanings to be leftist. While conservatives view Robinson as left-leaning, social media speculation has suggested he was aligned with far-right figures, including Nick Fuentes’ Groypers.Investigators note that Robinson’s motive against Kirk may have stemmed from the perception that Kirk was “too moderate” for some extremist groups.In a separate development, Trump announced that he plans to speak at Kirk’s funeral on Sunday in Phoenix, Arizona.“We’re going to have a stadium, and I bet that stadium is going to be pretty packed, maybe completely packed. It’s going to be big, but I’m going to be at the stadium, and I guess I’ll say a few words,” he said.The US President added that a “whole plane load” of supporters would attend the funeral. Trump said he didn’t yet know what his message would be, but that Kirk was “an amazing guy.”","Tyler Robinson, 22, is accused of killing conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

Trump-Putin Summit: ‘Panicked’ Zelensky Runs To Ally US | ‘Russia Will Use Captured Land As…’

'Doing everything he can to avoid sanctions'







Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday said that it may be “understandable” for Washington to impose tariffs on India and other nations for buying Russian oil, but warned the United States against waiting for others before acting against Vladimir Putin. The Ukrainian president argued that such delays only give Moscow more time to prepare, adding that the Russian leader is actively trying to manipulate his way out of global isolation.Speaking in an exclusive interview with Sky News at the Presidential Palace in Kyiv, Zelenskyy said Putin had gained far too much from last month’s Alaska summit with Donald Trump, a meeting from which Ukraine was excluded. “He should have received a setback in this war and stop. But instead, he received de-isolation. He got the photos with President Trump. He received public dialogue, and I think this opens the doors for Putin into some other summits and formats,” he said.Zelenskyy added that Putin is “doing everything he can to avoid sanctions” and agreed when asked whether the Kremlin leader was trying to trick the US president. “If you keep postponing applying sanctions any further, then the Russians will be better prepared,” he warned.For Zelenskyy, the Russian president “only understands force” and must face much stronger measures to be compelled to end the war.The Ukrainian leader’s remarks come as Trump has urged Nato countries to stop importing Russian oil and floated tariffs of up to 100 per cent on China. While acknowledging that such steps “are understandable,” Zelenskyy insisted that the US should not wait on Europe or other partners before acting. “I think the US is strong enough on its own. They can make this happen quicker and all that’s lacking now is a strong sanctions package from the US,” he said.Zelenskyy expressed frustration that the West has failed to impose enough costs on Moscow even as Russian strikes continue, including recent incursions into NATO airspace over Poland and Romania. He cautioned that giving Putin diplomatic space only emboldens him. “It is very important not to give Mr Putin this space, because otherwise he won’t feel compelled that he has to stop the war,” he said.Until recently, the Trump administration also targeted India over its purchase of Russian oil, imposing an additional 25% tariff on top of a baseline of 25% tariff. New Delhi has called the move unreasonable and unjustified.",Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said it may be ‘understandable’ for Washington to impose tariffs on India and other nations for buying Russian oil.

FBI Uncovers SHOCKING DNA Proof Against Charlie Kirk Assassin Tyler Robinson; Chilling Note Exposed

Who is Tyler Robinson?







FBI director Kash Patel on Monday revealed a key development in the investigation into the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk . Patel said the agency has recovered a “text thread” in which the alleged shooter, Tyler Robinson, wrote that he had the chance to kill Kirk and planned to act out of “hatred that cannot be negotiated with. ”In an appearance on Fox News’ “Fox & Friends,” FBI director Patel said investigators believe Tyler Robinson also wrote a physical note stating he had the “opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk” and would do so. Patel said the note was destroyed, but investigators have gathered forensic evidence proving it once existed and confirmed its contents through interviews.“I will say what was found in terms of information, a text message exchange where he, the suspect specifically stated that he had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk and he was gonna do that,” FBI director said.He added, “When he was asked why, he said some hatred cannot be negotiated with.”“I can report today that the DNA hits from the towel that was wrapped around the firearm and the DNA on the screwdriver are positively processed for the suspect in custody,” Patel told Fox & Friends.Investigators have not yet publicly disclosed a motive in the case. Law enforcement officials say they believe Robinson acted alone in the shooting of Kirk but are still examining whether anyone else may have been involved in planning the attack.Separately, the Washington Post reported Monday that Robinson had sent a message on the online platform Discord apparently confessing to the crime on Thursday night, just before his arrest.“It was me at UVU yesterday. im sorry for all of this,” read a message from Robinson’s account, according to the newspaper, which cited two people familiar with the chat and screenshots it had reviewed.Kirk, 31, a MAGA star, was shot dead last week during an outdoor event at Utah Valley University. He had been speaking and taking questions about the long-running culture of mass shootings and gun violence in America when the attack took place.US President Donald Trump , visibly affected by the death of his young ally, confirmed Kirk’s killing on Truth Social.He also posted a four-minute video calling the murder “an assassination” and remembering Kirk as “a patriot who devoted his life to open debate and the country he loved so much.”The suspect, arrested and identified by authorities for Kirk's assassination is a 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, a Utah resident.Robinson is a third-year student in the electrical apprenticeship programme at Dixie Technical College in St. George, Utah.State records show Robinson is a registered voter but unaffiliated with any political party. He did not vote in the two most recent general elections, despite being of voting age.","FBI director Kash Patel revealed a key development in the investigation into the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

Illinois television reporter Beni Rae Harmony has resigned after being suspended for delivering an emotional on-air tribute to conservative activist Charlie Kirk , who was assassinated last week while speaking at Utah Valley University.During her Friday broadcast on Springfield’s ABC affiliate WICS, Harmony paused to reflect on Kirk’s death. “Two days ago, I lost a mentor, my first boss, the first person who made me believe in myself,” she told viewers. Calling Kirk someone who encouraged her to chase her career, she urged audiences to lean on one another and stand up for their beliefs.She recalled one of Kirk’s sayings: “When conversations stop happening, when individuals become wordless, that’s when violence begins.” Harmony closed her remarks by thanking Kirk directly: “You changed my life.”The station suspended her following the broadcast, prompting Harmony to announce her resignation on social media. In a post on X, she wrote: “Effective immediately, I have resigned from @WICS\_ABC20 after being SUSPENDED for airing a non-partisan tribute to Charlie Kirk this past Friday.

In a major move aimed at curbing crime in Tennessee, President Donald Trump on Monday signed an executive order establishing the Memphis Safe Task Force, which will send National Guard troops to the city alongside federal law enforcement agencies.Speaking from the Oval Office, Trump said the effort would replicate the administration’s ongoing military-led response to urban crime in Democratic-run cities.“We’re going to fix that just like we did Washington,” he said, pledging to end the “savagery” and to “make Memphis safe again.”The task force will include personnel from the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the US Marshals Service and the Department of Justice. The deployment, Trump said, is aimed at targeting career criminals and restoring public safety.While signing the executive order, President Trump said, ""This team will deploy the full powers of federal law enforcement agencies... to restore public safety and get dangerous career criminals off our streets. In 2024, Memphis had the highest violent crime rate, the highest property crime rate, and the third highest murder rate of any city in the nation.""Tennessee Governor Bill Lee welcomed the move. “I’m tired of crime holding the great city of Memphis back,” Lee said. Trump told the governor that the crackdown “will be your proudest moment” and predicted that violent crime would “plummet” within weeks.The signing was attended by Tennessee’s Republican senators, Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty. Trump has previously deployed federal forces to Washington DC, despite violent crime in the city being at a 30-year low.In a post on X, Rapid Response shared Memphis’s crime statistics. According to the post, in 2024 the city recorded the highest violent and property crime rates in the US, with its murder rate ranking third nationally. Violent crime was reported to be 344% above the national average, while the city’s murder rate was four times higher than Mexico City, 27 times higher than Havana, and 37 times higher than London.Speculation had pointed to Chicago as the next city where President Trump might deploy the National Guard and other federal authorities, as reported by the Guardian.""We’re going to be doing Chicago probably next”, the US President said. “We don’t want to lose Chicago,” he added noting that he has a “great, beautiful building” on the city’s skyline.Trump also suggested that St Louis, New Orleans and Baltimore could be potential future targets for similar federal interventions. “We want to save these places,” he said.The president stressed that the administration will proceed with crime-fighting measures even if local leaders do not fully cooperate. “We hope we have the governor’s help,” he said. “But if we don’t, we’re doing it without him.”","President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing the Memphis Safe Task Force.

US President Donald Trump urged Israel to be “very careful” in its actions concerning Qatar, highlighting the Gulf nation’s role as a key ally of the United States.Speaking to reporters at Morristown Airport, Trump was asked whether he had a message for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu following last week’s airstrikes on Hamas leaders in Qatar, which reportedly failed to eliminate their targets, Times of Israel reported.“My message is that they have to be very, very careful. They have to do something about Hamas, but Qatar has been a great ally to the United States. A lot of people don’t know that,” Trump said.The US President's remarks come days after he hosted Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani for dinner in New York.Trump described the Qatari leader as a “wonderful person” and said he had advised Qatar to improve its public image. “People talk of it so badly, and they shouldn’t be,” Trump added.Trump was joined at the dinner by Middle East Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, as the president marked the anniversary of the September 11 attacks in New York.“Great dinner with POTUS. Just ended,” Qatar’s deputy chief of mission, Hamah Al-Muftah, said in a post on X.The meeting followed an Israeli strike in Doha that killed six people, including a Qatari security officer, though Hamas leaders escaped unharmed.The attack, which took place in the Katara district, drew condemnation from Qatar as “state terrorism.”Earlier, US President has expressed concern over the strike, saying he was “not thrilled about the whole situation” and warning that it could undermine ongoing efforts to secure a fragile Gaza ceasefire.“I’m not thrilled about the whole situation. It’s not a good situation,” he told reporters at the White House. “But I will say this, we want the hostages back, but we are not thrilled about the way that went down,” he added.The US President sought to distance himself from the strike, emphasizing that it “does not advance Israel or America’s goals,” and assured Qatar that such an incident would not be repeated.",US President Donald Trump urged Israel to be ‘very careful’ in its actions concerning Qatar.

The US vice president JD Vance announced that he will host 'The Charlie Kirk Show' from the White House on Monday to pay tribute to his slain friend.The show is scheduled to air at noon, less than a week after Kirk was assassinated during a college campus visit in Utah.Vance and Kirk had been close friends for many years, long before Vance entered politics. In a letter to Kirk shared after his death at Utah Valley University, Vance reflected on their time together.He noted that Kirk was one of the first people he contacted when he decided to run for the US Senate in 2021 and that Kirk helped connect him with others who could support his campaign, including Donald Trump Jr.Vance described Kirk as one of his most dedicated advocates over the years, who even helped guide the selection process that ultimately led to Vance becoming vice-president.The vice president said he first learned about Kirk being shot through group messages with friends and government officials while in a meeting in the West Wing.“God didn’t answer those prayers, and that’s OK. He had other plans. And now that Charlie is in heaven, I’ll ask him to talk to big man directly on behalf of his family, his friends, and the country he loved so dearly,” Vance wrote.Vance had also accompanied Kirk’s body during transport from Utah to his home state of Arizona.Images from the flight show Kirk’s wife, Erika, dressed in black and holding their two young children, walking hand-in-hand with second lady Usha Vance. The vice president and uniformed service members helped carry the flag-draped casket onto the plane.Earlier, on Wednesday, Vance paid tribute to Kirk on social media, calling him “a true friend” and a major influence in his rise in national politics. Kirk, the conservative activist who was shot at Utah Valley University, helped shape Vance’s path from a MAGA outsider to the vice presidency.“Charlie was fascinated by ideas and always willing to learn and change his mind,” Vance wrote. “Like me, he was skeptical of Donald Trump in 2016. Like me, he came to see President Trump as the only figure capable of moving American politics away from the globalism that had dominated for our entire lives. When others were right, he learned from them. When he was right — as he usually was — he was generous.”Vance said Kirk was crucial to his 2022 Senate campaign in Ohio, assisting with strategy, fundraising, and grassroots connections. “He introduced me to some of the people who would run my campaign and also to Donald Trump Jr., who took a call from me because Charlie asked,” he wrote.Kirk's children also remained deeply involved with Vance’s family and they often spent time together.“Our kids, especially our oldest, struggled with the attention and the constant presence of the protective detail. I felt this acute sense of guilt that I had conscripted my kids into this life without getting their permission. And Charlie was constantly calling and texting, checking on our family and offering guidance and prayers,” Vance said.","US vice president JD Vance will host 'The Charlie Kirk Show' from the White House on Monday. The show is scheduled to air at noon, less than a week after Kirk was assassinated during a college campus visit in Utah. Vance and Kirk had been close friends for many years, long before Vance entered politics.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123891199,imgsize-886448,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

Trump’s schedule at Windsor Castle

Chequers meeting with PM Keir Starmer





US President Donald Trump will make an unprecedented second state visit to the United Kingdom from September 16 to 18, accompanied by First Lady Melania Trump.Trump was previously hosted by the late Queen Elizabeth II in June 2019. Traditionally, US presidents serving a second term are not offered a state visit; instead, they are usually invited for tea or lunch with the monarch, as was the case with Barack Obama and George W Bush.However, in February, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer presented Trump with an invitation from King Charles III during a White House meeting on a UK-US trade deal. Keir called the invitation ""truly historic"" and ""unprecedented,"" while Trump described it as a ""great, great honour.""On the second day of the visit, Trump and Melania will travel to Windsor Castle, where they will be greeted by the Prince and Princess of Wales before a formal welcome by the King and Queen. A royal salute will be fired in Windsor and at the Tower of London.Trump will lay a wreath at St George’s Chapel on the tomb of Queen Elizabeth II. Later, a flypast featuring UK and US F-35 fighter jets and the Red Arrows will take place. That evening, a traditional state banquet will be held at Windsor Castle, during which both the King and the US president will deliver speeches.On the third day, Trump will meet Starmer at Chequers. The agenda includes viewing the Winston Churchill archives, holding talks, and delivering a joint news conference.During his 2019 state visit, Trump traveled on Air Force One, and his motorcade — including the armoured limousine The Beast — was flown in by US Air Force transport aircraft. The 2019 visit involved more than 6,300 police officers and cost 3.4 million pounds for London’s Metropolitan Police.","US President Donald Trump will make an unprecedented second state visit to the UK.

‘Up to China’: Donald Trump leaves TikTok’s US ban in doubt; hints at a factor that could save app,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/up-to-china-donald-trump-leaves-tiktoks-us-ban-in-doubt-hints-at-a-factor-that-could-save-app/articleshow/123889597.cms,"US President Donald Trump (AP images)





US President Donald Trump on Sunday struck an ambiguous note on the future of TikTok, suggesting that China would ultimately decide the app’s fate just days ahead of a September 17 deadline for its parent company ByteDance to sell its US assets or face a ban.“We may let it die, or we may, I don’t know — it depends, up to China,” Trump told reporters in New Jersey before returning to Washington.Trump has already pushed back the TikTok deadline three times since January. While lawmakers warn that the app poses national security risks, he has also credited it with helping him connect with younger voters during last year’s election.Last month, US President said that he had US buyers lined up for the app and signaled he could extend the deadline again. On Sunday, however, he sounded less certain. “It doesn’t matter too much. I’d like to do it for the kids. They like it,” he said.The president also pointed to TikTok’s role in his campaign outreach. “I did very well on TikTok, and I got the youth vote and I got numbers that nobody’s ever even come close to in the Republican Party,” he said.“Some was attributed to TikTok, and a lot was attributed to Charlie,” he added, referring to conservative activist Charlie Kirk who was assassinated on September 10 while speaking at Utah Valley University.Sources suggest that the administration is likely to grant another extension rather than force a shutdown this week. Such a move would give more time for negotiations but could frustrate lawmakers in Congress who have pressed for a clear decision on the platform, as reported by news agency Reuters.Meanwhile, American and Chinese officials held talks in Madrid on Sunday, where TikTok was part of a broader trade agenda. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer met Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and top negotiator Li Chenggang.TikTok had not featured in earlier rounds of trade discussions in Geneva, London and Stockholm. Since beginning his second term in January, Trump has chosen not to enforce the law requiring TikTok’s US assets to be sold or shut down. Instead, he has pushed back the deadline three times, first to April, then to June and most recently to September.With the deadline approaching, a final agreement is unlikely, leaving the platform’s future uncertain.",TikTok's parent company ByteDance has until September 17 to sell its US assets or face a ban.

US President Donald Trump launched a $15 billion defamation lawsuit against the New York Times, accusing the paper of being a “mouthpiece” for Democrats and of waging a decades-long ""campaign of lies"" against him.In a post on Truth Social, the US president wrote: “Today, I have the Great Honor of bringing a $15 Billion Dollar Defamation and Libel Lawsuit against The New York Times, one of the worst and most degenerate newspapers in the History of our Country, becoming a virtual ‘mouthpiece’ for the Radical Left Democrat Party.”Trump claimed the Times’ endorsement of Kamala Harris, which he said was placed prominently on the front page, amounted to “the single largest illegal Campaign contribution, EVER.” He accused the paper of spreading falsehoods about him, his family, his business, and the America First movement.He added: “The New York Times has been allowed to freely lie, smear, and defame me for far too long, and that stops, NOW! The suit is being brought in the Great State of Florida.”The president also referenced what he described as past “successful litigation” against media outlets including ABC, CBS and Disney.Trump’s lawsuit against the New York Times follows a string of high-profile legal battles with major US broadcasters. Earlier this year, ABC News agreed to pay $15 million towards the president’s planned library to settle a defamation claim. The case centred on anchor George Stephanopoulos’ on-air remarks in which he inaccurately said Trump had been found liable for rape in the E. Jean Carroll case. The network issued an editor’s note expressing regret and covered an additional $1 million in legal fees.Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS, also reached a settlement after Trump sued over what he alleged was a deceptively edited interview with then-rival Kamala Harris aired on 60 Minutes. The company agreed to pay $16 million, again directed to Trump’s library project rather than to him directly. Trump’s legal team described the outcome as “a win for the American people” and proof, they argued, of widespread misconduct in mainstream media.Both settlements were struck in federal courts and avoided potentially damaging depositions.",US President Donald Trump has launched a $15 billion defamation lawsuit against the New York Times.

British punk duo Bob Vylan are facing renewed controversy after frontman Bobby Vylan branded slain US commentator Charlie Kirk “an absolute piece of shit of a human being” during a performance in Amsterdam last week. The remarks, which surfaced in viral clips online, sparked outrage among right-wing groups and prompted the cancellation of a planned concert in the Dutch city of Tilburg.During the Paradiso show, Bobby told the crowd: “The pronouns was/were. Cause if you chat shit you will get banged. Rest in peace Charlie Kirk, you piece of shit.” The UK branch of Turning Point, founded by Kirk, accused him of mocking and glorifying the murder.Responding to the backlash, Bobby denied celebrating Kirk’s death: “At no point during yesterday’s show was Charlie Kirk’s death celebrated … I did call him a piece of shit. That much is true. But at no point was his death celebrated.” He claimed one reporter had distorted his comments, adding: “Calm down.”The Tilburg venue 013 defended its cancellation, saying that while punk activism often pushed boundaries, “these new statements go too far.”The duo had already courted controversy earlier in June at Glastonbury, where Bobby led chants of “death to the IDF”, triggering a criminal investigation by Avon and Somerset police.In the immediate aftermath of the Glastonbury performance, the US State Department revoked the band’s visas, forcing the cancellation of a 19-date American tour. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau posted that foreigners who “glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country.” British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the chants “appalling hate speech”, while festival organiser Emily Eavis said the group had “very much crossed a line”.Despite clarifying that the chant was directed at the Israeli military and “not antisemitic”, the fallout continued. Boardmasters festival in Cornwall later faced a licensing challenge for allowing Bob Vylan to perform, though no incidents were reported.","Bobby Vylan branded slain US commentator Charlie Kirk “an absolute piece of shit of a human being” during a performance in Amsterdam last week.

JD Vance hosts 'The Charlie Kirk Show': US VP lashes out at liberals; recalls Erika’s tribute,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jd-vance-hosts-the-charlie-kirk-show-us-vp-lashes-out-at-liberals-recalls-erikas-tribute/articleshow/123911323.cms,"



US Vice-President JD Vance has said that national unity is impossible with people who celebrate the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk , warning that such behaviour fuels further political violence.Speaking as guest host of The Charlie Kirk Show on Monday, Vance said: “Call them out, and hell, call their employer. We don't believe in political violence, but we do believe in civility.”The vice-president took over presenting duties from his ceremonial office at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, with the programme livestreamed into the White House press briefing room. It was the first episode of the podcast since Kirk, 31, was fatally shot in the neck while moderating a debate at Utah Valley University last week.Vance, who flew Kirk’s body home to Arizona aboard Air Force Two, said he was “filling in for somebody who cannot be filled in for”. He recounted conversations with Kirk’s widow Erika, describing him as “a kind, loving husband”, and admitted her words had inspired him to “be a better husband and… a better father”.In his remarks, Vance directly challenged those making light of Kirk’s assassination. “There is no unity with the people who celebrate Charlie Kirk's assassination,” he said.“There is no unity with someone who lies about what Charlie Kirk said in order to excuse his murder… And there is no unity with the people who fund these articles, who pay the salaries of these terrorist sympathisers who argue that Charlie Kirk, a loving husband and father, deserved a shot to the neck because he spoke words with which they disagree. ”He added: “I’m desperate for our country to be united in condemnation of the actions and the ideas that killed my friend. I want it so badly that I will tell you a difficult truth. We can only have it with people who acknowledge that political violence is unacceptable.”Other Republicans have echoed calls for accountability. Florida congressman Randy Fine said he would “demand their firing, defunding, and licence revocation”, while South Carolina’s Nancy Mace urged federal funding to be cut from universities that refuse to act.Vance, who described Kirk as a close friend and mentor, credited him with helping President Donald Trump’s re-election and with shaping the administration. “If it weren't for Charlie Kirk, I would not be the vice president of the United States,” he said.","US Vice-President JD Vance spoke as guest host of The Charlie Kirk Show.

‘Qatar Great Ally, Be Very Careful’: Donald Trump Blasts Netanyahu After Israel’s Doha Strike

Trump's 'NASTY' Ultimatum To Hamas After Shock Ceasefire Offer; Inside Look At New Deal I Details

Trump on Qatar strikes:

Netanyahu thanks President Trump:





US President Donald Trump on Monday (local time) issued a stern warning to Hamas, saying “all bets are off” if reports are confirmed that the group has moved hostages above ground to use them as human shields against Israel’s ongoing ground offensive in Gaza City.In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump called the alleged move a “human atrocity” and demanded the immediate release of all hostages.“I have just read a News Report that Hamas has moved the hostages above ground to use them as human shields against Israel’s ground offensive. I hope the Leaders of Hamas know what they’re getting into if they do such a thing. This is a human atrocity, the likes of which few people have ever seen before. Don’t let this happen or, ALL “BETS” ARE OFF. RELEASE ALL HOSTAGES NOW!” Trump wrote.The warning comes as Israeli forces intensified airstrikes and reportedly pushed tanks into Gaza City, according to Palestinian media. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have been urging residents to evacuate the densely populated northern city, where hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians are still sheltering.The IDF has launched its ground offensive to take over Gaza City, Times of Israel reported quoting an Axios story that cited unnamed Israeli officials.In recent days, the army had expanded airstrikes in and around the city but had not previously sent ground troops into the urban center, where hundreds of thousands of civilians remain.According to the IDF, around 300,000 Palestinians have left Gaza City in recent weeks. The city’s population had grown to nearly one million displaced people earlier this year. The army has been urging residents to evacuate, but with limited success, as many fear other parts of the Strip are just as unsafe.Speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump addressed regional concerns following last week’s Israeli strike in Doha that targeted Hamas leaders. The attack drew sharp criticism from Qatar and other US allies in the Gulf.Asked whether Israel had given assurances not to target Qatar again, Trump said, “He [Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu] won’t be hitting Qatar.” He described the Gulf state as “a very good ally, and a lot of people don’t know that,” while adding that Israel would continue pursuing Hamas elsewhere.The president said he was troubled by reports that Hamas planned to use hostages as human shields. “I thought that was very terrible and I put out a statement,” Trump said, referring to his Truth Social post.His remarks come just days after he hosted Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani for dinner in New York.The Doha strike, which killed six people including a Qatari security officer, but left Hamas leaders unharmed, drew condemnation from Qatar, which denounced it as “state terrorism.”Trump also rejected an Axios report claiming Netanyahu had tipped him off about the strike in advance, giving Washington time to call it off. He insisted he only learned of the operation when it was too late to intervene.Shortly after Trump’s warning, Netanyahu expressed gratitude for US support. “Thank you President Trump for your unflinching support for Israel’s battle against Hamas and the release of all our hostages,” the Israeli prime minister said, as reported by The Times of Israel.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio arrived in Israel on Sunday morning for a two-day visit focused on the ongoing war in Gaza.Before leaving Washington, Rubio wrote on social media that his priorities included securing the release of hostages, ensuring that humanitarian aid reaches civilians and addressing the continuing threat posed by Hamas.","US President Donald Trump issued a stern warning to Hamas, saying “all bets are off” if reports are confirmed that the group has moved hostages above ground to use them as human shields.

""They will be very happy!""The comments come days before Wednesday's deadline for the app to be sold by its Chinese owner, ByteDance, or face a ban in US. The deadline has been extended multiple times.If it comes to fruition, a deal between Washington and Beijing would resolve years of wrangling over the future of the wildly popular video app. TikTok has faced accusations for years that it poses a national security risk because Beijing could use the app to seek sensitive data on Americans, or to spread propaganda to advance its policy goals.A federal law passed last year and upheld by the Supreme Court required ByteDance to find new owners or otherwise face a ban in the US.Trump has declined to enforce the law while his administration tries to broker the app's sale, a move that tests the boundaries of executive power.In April, officials in Washington were close to a plan to bring on a group of new US investors, which could have included private equity giants and venture capital firms. But the Chinese govt seemed to balk after Trump announced a spate of tariffs on the country.Bessent declined to describe the terms of the deal. ""It's between two private parties,"" he said.
