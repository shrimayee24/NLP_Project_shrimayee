PUNE/NASHIK: Conviction over securing a flat under a 10% EWS quota in 1995 by showing lower income has put a question mark over Manikrao Kokate's continuation as an MLA and as a Maharashtra cabinet minister.A Nashik sessions court upheld Tuesday a Feb 20 trial court judgment convicting and sentencing the sports minister and NCP functionary, along with his brother Vijay Kokate, to two years of rigorous imprisonment in the housing quota cheating case. The siblings had secured two flats. The court, however, set aside the trial court's direction to Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority and deputy collector to cancel the allotment of flats to the Kokate brothers and restore possession as earlier.Kokate represents Sinnar in rural Nashik. The ruling triggers the risk of ""immediate disqualification"" under the Representation of the People Act for sentences of two years or more, unless a higher court stays the conviction.Public prosecutor Sudhir Kotwal said the matter must now go to the high court. ""Under the law, Kokate's disqualification is certain unless he gets a suspension of his sentence and a stay on his conviction from the high court.Even with urgent circulation, this may take eight to 10 days. There is no bar on disqualification in the intervening period,"" Kotwal said.Assembly speaker Rahul Narwekar said he had not yet received the order. Supreme Court ruling from 2013 states disqualification is immediate, despite a three-month window to appeal. Relief comes only if conviction itself is stayed.Kokate's lawyer Avinash Bhide disagreed. ""We have a month's time to secure a stay and suspension from the high court. Even after that, the matter goes before the speaker,"" Bhide said.After the trial court ruling, Kokate had secured bail and on March 5, a sessions court stay on conviction and sentence during pendency of appeal. That protection has lapsed. ""Once a sessions court confirms conviction in appeal, it has no power to grant bail. The matter goes to the high court,"" Kotwal said.The prosecution said the brothers applied for flats under the EWS quota, declaring annual income of Rs 25,000 each, below the Rs 30,000 eligibility ceiling. ""Allotment relied on affidavits. When falsity emerged, onus lay on the deponents to prove otherwise,"" Kotwal said. Prosecutors said Kokate failed to disclose improved finances even by 1995, citing documents showing supplies of 70 tonnes, 80 tonnes and 120 tonnes of sugarcane in 1993, 1994 and 1995 to the Kopargaon cooperative sugar mill, yielding substantial earnings. ""This line weighed with the sessions court while affirming conviction and sentence,"" Kotwal said.Opposition parties accused BJP-headed govt of double standards, citing the swift disqualification of Congress MP Rahul Gandhi after his 2023 defamation conviction and contrasting it with the continued tenure of Kokate. ""Govt should immediately dismiss Kokate,"" Maharashtra Congress chief Harshvardhan Sapkal said. NCP state president Sunil Tatkare said the party would decide its next course of action after discussing the ruling with party chief and deputy CM Ajit Pawar.","Kokate represents Sinnar in rural Nashik.

Opposition remains unsparing

NEW DELHI: Uttar Pradesh minister Sanjay Nishad on Wednesday defended his controversial remark on Bihar CM Nitish Kumar pulling down a woman’s hijab, saying his comment was ""misunderstood"" due to translation issues and carried no ill intent, even as opposition parties intensified their demand for an unconditional apology.As outrage mounted across political lines, the Nishad Party chief sought to play down the remark, describing it as a casual, light-hearted comment made in Hindi that lost its meaning when translated.The comment, widely criticised as misogynistic and crude, was made during an interview with a private television channel and later circulated on social media.""My remark was tweaked and twisted, misinterpreted, its spirit lost in cacophony and translation,"" the Uttar Pradesh fisheries minister told news agency PTI, responding to criticism from the Congress, Samajwadi Party (SP) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).""If someone has taken offence, I am willing to take back the words from my side,"" he said.Nishad argued that linguistic and cultural differences played a role in the backlash, pointing to his roots in the Bhojpuri-speaking belt of eastern Uttar Pradesh.""I belong to Gorakhpur and the Bhojpuri-speaking belt and expressions and conversational styles differ from region to region,"" he said, adding, ""In Bhojpuri, this is a common way of urging people not to make too much of any issue and to counsel restraint.I chose to use the same style in Hindi and didn't know it will become such an issue.""Drawing comparisons with other regions, he said, ""Just as language and expressions vary in Haryana, Delhi, Maharashtra or Tamil Nadu, dialects in north India and eastern Uttar Pradesh also differ. That does not mean there was any intention to insult.""The controversy stems from a video showing Nitish Kumar pulling down a woman’s veil during a government programme in Patna on Monday. Nishad defended the Bihar chief minister’s action, claiming Kumar had ""merely removed"" the veil to confirm whether the actual beneficiary of a government scheme was present.He further said the lapse lay with officials responsible for organising the event. ""The responsibility lay with officials who should have ensured proper arrangements before the programme,"" he said.Nishad insisted his comments were not directed against any woman, community or religion. ""There was neither malice nor any intention of disrespect,"" he said, while alleging that the issue was being deliberately amplified for political gains.The controversy snowballed after Nishad made the remark during the televised interview: ""(He is also a man; one should not go after someone so much. What happened if the veil was removed? What would have happened if he had touched somewhere else?""Congress’ Uttar Pradesh chief Ajay Rai described Nishad’s statement as ""outrageously anti-women"" and said it reflected the mindset of the BJP and its allies. ""We seek unconditional apology failing which we will seek minister's dismissal,"" Rai told PTI.Samajwadi Party spokesperson Abbas Haider termed the remarks ""condemnable and undignified"", adding, ""I would also like to ask if this is the idea of the BJP led government in UP which the minister has reflected in his statements."" He too demanded ""an immediate and unconditional apology.""The AAP’s Uttar Pradesh unit accused the minister of making ""shameful"" and ""anti-women"" comments, saying the statement exposed a ""crude and misogynistic mindset"".Social media platforms were flooded with posts criticising Nishad for what many described as an unacceptable and sexist viewpoint.The video clip has since been widely shared, further fuelling the political storm around the minister’s comments.","Uttar Pradesh fisheries minister Sanjay Nishad defends his controversial remark on Bihar CM Nitish Kumar pulling down a woman's hijab.

'Insulting the army has become the hallmark of the Congress'

NEW DELHI: Congress leader and former Maharashtra chief minister Prithviraj Chavan on Wednesday refused to apologise for his remarks on Operation Sindoor , saying the Constitution gives him the right to ask questions.“Why will I apologise? It is out of the question. The Constitution gives me the right to ask questions,” Chavan said when asked whether he would apologise for his remarks.This comes a day after Chavan stirred controversy by claiming that India was “completely defeated” on the first day of Operation Sindoor, while questioning the conduct of the military operation.Speaking to reporters in Pune, Chavan alleged that India suffered setbacks on the first day of the operation.“On the first day (of Operation Sindoor), we were completely defeated. In the half-hour aerial engagement that took place on the 7th, we were fully defeated, whether people accept it or not. Indian aircraft were shot down. The Air Force was completely grounded, and not a single aircraft flew. If any aircraft had taken off from Gwalior, Bathinda or Sirsa, there was a high probability of being shot down by Pakistan, which is why the Air Force was fully grounded,” Chavan said.The Congress leader further alleged that Operation Sindoor involved only aerial and missile warfare and saw no ground movement by the armed forces.""Recently, we saw during Operation Sindoor, there was not even a one-kilometre movement of the military... Whatever happened over two or three days was only an aerial war and missile warfare. In the future too, wars will be fought in the same way. In such a situation, do we really need to maintain an army of 12 lakh soldiers, or can we make they do some other work?"" Chavan said.Reacting strongly, BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla accused the Congress of repeatedly disrespecting the Indian Armed Forces and undermining national security operations.Poonawalla said the statements made by the former Maharashtra chief minister were “shocking” and targeted the Air Force and the armed forces.""Insulting the army has become the hallmark of the Congress party... This is not just Prithviraj Chavan's statement; Rahul Gandhi has also made similar statements,"" Poonawalla said.All these statements reflect Rahul Gandhi's mindset, which is why Rahul Gandhi or the Congress party does not take any action against such leaders... These statements reveal their anti-army mentality,"" he added.Union minister Giriraj Singh also launched a broadside against Chavan and said that no one has the right to ""insult the valour of the Armed Forces.""""No one has the right to insult the valour of the Armed Forces. Those who do so can never think of the nation’s interest....It has become Congress’s habit to insult the Armed Forces,” Giriraj Singh said.Operation Sindoor was launched by India on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure deep inside Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). The operation was carried out in retaliation for the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, in which 26 civilians were killed.","Congress leader and former Maharashtra chief minister Prithviraj Chavan refused to apologise for his remarks on Operation Sindoor.

The rules prohibit supervisors from pursuing relationships with those they oversee and require immediate disclosure. Insiders say the relationship was a “poorly kept secret,” but policy violations applied only to Moore.

How Michigan’s relationship policy shifted responsibility onto Sherrone Moore, not Paige Shiver

The firing of Michigan head coach Sherrone Moore sent shockwaves through college football, but it also raised a second, more complicated question: why was the staff member at the center of the scandal not dismissed as well? As scrutiny intensified following Moore’s December 10 removal, attention quickly shifted to Paige Shiver, who remains employed by the university.To many observers, the outcome felt inconsistent. However, Michigan’s decision is rooted less in optics and more in institutional policy. Understanding why Shiver kept her job requires a closer look at how universities define power, responsibility, and disclosure in workplace relationships and why accountability does not always fall equally on both parties.Michigan officials confirmed on December 15 that Shiver continues to work at the university, a decision that aligns with Policy No. 201.97 governing supervisor-employee relationships. The policy is explicit about where responsibility lies: supervisors are prohibited from initiating or attempting to initiate intimate relationships with those they oversee and are required to disclose any such relationships immediately.The language is unambiguous. “Recognizing that Intimate Relationships exist or may develop in the workplace that are not initiated by a Supervisor and are free from coercion and abuse of power, immediate disclosure of the relationship by the Supervisor is required,” the policy states.It further adds, “Failure of the Supervisor to disclose an Intimate Relationship is a serious offense and cause for discipline, up to and including dismissal from employment. Although encouraged, Supervisees have no obligation to disclose.”In Moore’s case, the alleged violations were twofold: entering into a relationship with someone under his authority and failing to report it to university officials. Under the policy, those failures rest squarely on the supervisor, not the subordinate.Complicating matters further are reports suggesting the relationship was widely known within the athletic department. Insider Tony Garcia described the situation as “a poorly kept secret,” saying, “I’ve spoken to a number of people in and around the athletic department… and it’s sort of been characterized as a a poorly kept secret.” Garcia added that whispers had circulated for months before the scandal became public.While those claims raise uncomfortable questions about internal oversight and institutional awareness, they do not override written policy. For now, Michigan’s stance reflects a broader principle in higher education governance: discipline follows authority. Whether that approach satisfies public perception is another debate entirely, but on paper, the university is following its own rules.Also Read: Are Sherrone Moore and his wife Kelli headed for divorce?

“absolutely sickening”

“It’s a horrifying and gratuitous use of cruelty against an animal who is simply trying to exist.”

Ross Creations’ viral opossum catapult prompts authorities to launch investigation





YouTuber Ross Creations has received widespread criticism following the posting of a viral video depicting his own ‘opossum launcher.’ In the Instagram post on November 30, 2025, a wild American opossum stepped onto a catapult baited with food and was flung several meters into the air, but it walked away without injury. Though this seemed to be the case for the opossum, some fans have condemned Ross for his lack of concern about this act, which has been described by many to be cruel. Many have signed online petitions requesting action by authorities on this violation of state laws against animal cruelty in Florida.An investigation was conducted by the Florida State Attorney’s Office and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC). There were reports filed at the Sarasota County Sheriff’s Office concerning the video shoot. The Emergency Response Team Director for PETA, Kristin Rickman, stated that the video wasand described it asAccording to Florida Statute 828.12, animal cruelty may involve the unnecessary torturing, over-driving, or mutilation of any animal through imprisonment or a fine. As yet, Ross Creations has not commented publicly on the video shoot, though the video has been removed from his page.In the video below, Ross was able to demonstrate the effectiveness of the device by placing some food on the catapult, enticing the opossum onto it, and launching the opossum several meters high into the air.While Ross joked about the incident, many viewers took to social media to condemn the stunt as an act of animal cruelty. Ross has had two run-ins with the law in the past for impersonating a police officer in 2019 and trespassing in 2024. The FWC has called for anyone with information about the event to call the Wildlife Alert Hotline.The incident has led to wider debates over the ethics of content creators on the Internet, as well as the effects of extreme prank videos. Some have come up in support of Ross Creation as a prankster, while others have stated that it is the responsibility of public figures not to do anything that will actually hurt animals. The end result of the investigation may lead to serious charges for Ross, depending on how it is determined by the State of Florida.Also Read: Twitch streamer Rakai mocked Kai Cenat’s mental health video, sparking online outrage","YouTuber Ross Creations posted a video of himself launching an opossum into the air with a catapult.

Substance Abusers Fined Up To ₹30,000

BENGALURU: A controversial ""drug penalty"" system in a residential complex has prompted a full-fledged criminal investigation, with police accusing the apartment association and a private security firm of running an illegal parallel justice mechanism and systematically suppressing serious crimes.Kumbalgodu police have registered a suo motu criminal case against the Provident Sunworth Apartment Association and Tyko Security Pvt Ltd, after preliminary findings revealed that the association allegedly imposed penalties amounting to over Rs 3.3 lakh between July and Nov on those caught in possession of drugs or were found partying into the wee hours in their flats.The association, however, has not put out any statement so far with regard to the police charges.Earlier this week, TOI had highlighted the police action of issuing a notice to the association following the detention of four student-residents, who were caught with ganja outside the apartment complex at Doddabele, off Mysuru Road.According to senior police officers, the investigation was triggered by an anonymous complaint from a resident, which alleged that the association had framed its own bylaws to ""investigate"" and ""settle"" criminal offences internally.A preliminary inquiry substantiated the allegations, prompting police to register a case Tuesday.Investigators allege that the association, in collusion with the private security agency, conducted unauthorised inquiries into offences ranging from drug possession and theft to sexual harassment and assault, imposed fines ranging from Rs 10,000 to Rs 50,000, and allowed the accused to remain within the complex or quietly vacate—without filing police complaints.""This is a clear case of deliberate suppression of cognizable offences,"" a senior police officer said. ""By collecting fines and not reporting crimes, they denied justice to the victims and helped the accused persons evade legal actions.""Deputy commissioner of police (southwest) Anitha B Haddannavar confirmed that the apartment houses several students from nearby colleges, many of whom are tenants. ""We verified that the association illegally collected penalties from residents, particularly students, for alleged misconduct. Serious offences cannot be settled internally under any circumstances,"" she said.Police said offences allegedly covered up include possession of narcotics, sexual harassment of domestic workers and thefts. The association is accused of using its basement office to collect fines, both in cash and via online transfers.While the association has existed since 2003 and had legitimate bylaws for minor issues such as parking violations or damage to common property, police noted that over the past few months, they were extended unlawfully to criminal matters.""Apartment associations have no legal authority to conduct investigations or impose penalties for criminal offences,"" Haddannavar said. ""Such matters must be reported immediately to police.""Investigators have also found that several residents who were fined were allegedly forced to vacate the premises, complicating efforts to trace the victims and accused persons. Police are now attempting to identify those who have paid penalties since 2023.The case has been registered under Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita sections 211, 238, and 239, relating to failure to report offences, disappearance of evidence, and intentional omission of information, along with provisions of the NDPS Act.",Kumbalgodu police have registered a suo motu criminal case against the Provident Sunworth Apartment Association and Tyko Security Pvt Ltd.

Candace Owens’ SHOCKING Declaration After 4.5-Hour Meeting With Charlie Kirk’s Widow Erika | Watch



Candace Owens and Erika Kirk clash over claims surrounding Charlie Kirk’s death





Candace Owens is standing firm after a long, private meeting with Erika Kirk, following public claims and theories about Charlie Kirk ’s death that have caused anger and deep splits inside conservative circles. Candace Owens met with Erika Kirk and senior Turning Point USA staff for more than four hours. The goal was clear. Erika wanted Owens to stop spreading claims that suggest Charlie Kirk’s death involved outside actors and a possible cover-up.But after the meeting, Owens made it clear she would not take back her words. She said the discussion did not change her thinking. Erika Kirk, however, said the meeting was “productive” and stressed that the case, as she understands it, is now fully with law enforcement. The disagreement has played out publicly through podcasts, social media posts, and cable news, drawing massive online attention and sharp reactions from well-known conservative voices.Candace Owens has repeatedly said she believes more than one person may be involved in what she calls Charlie Kirk’s death. She has hinted at foreign involvement and suggested that people close to Kirk may have “betrayed” him.Erika Kirk has strongly pushed back. She has said these claims are not true and has urged people to trust investigators.Speaking on CBS, Erika directly denied one of Candace Owens’ claims, saying, “If you want to check out my flight log, you are more than welcome. It is very boring.” She added that Owens had cited dates when she was actually in the hospital.According to CNN, one theory shared by Owens claimed that foreign aircraft were following Erika Kirk for years. Owens later said on her podcast, “I understand why these aircraft have brought such fear, and that is because there is overwhelming proof that these aircraft are continuously coming and going from Israel.”Candace Owens’ comments have divided conservatives. Tucker Carlson, Megyn Kelly, and comedian Dave Smith have shown some support for her questioning. Tim Pool and Ben Shapiro criticized Owens’ actions, with Shapiro calling them “evil.” Nick Fuentes accused Owens of seeking attention.Megyn Kelly revealed on her podcast that she helped arrange the meeting between Owens and Erika Kirk. Kelly said she supports Owens’ right to ask questions but added, “I don’t believe anyone at Turning Point was involved.”Candace Owens later said Erika arrived with phone records and a lawyer. Erika Kirk posted on X that the meeting was respectful. Owens told listeners she will not change her views, even as many YouTube viewers said the episode brought little new information.Also Read: Megyn Kelly Reveals How She Quietly Brought Erika Kirk And Candace Owens Together For A Private Meeting","Candace Owens met with Erika Kirk and senior Turning Point USA staff for more than four hours.

HYDERABAD: Officers with Telangana police's intelligence wing said on Wednesday that Sydney terror accused Sajid Akram had been trying to get Australian citizenship for many years but, for reasons unknown to his family, did not succeed. '""What we know is that Sajid renewed his Indian passport last in 2022 and did not visit Pakistan.Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) examined Naveed, Sajid's 24-year-old son and the other accused in the Bondi beach killings, in 2019 for his alleged ties with a local Islamic State cell in Sydney. They, however, cleared him as not an imminent threat,"" a senior police officer said.The officer added that Sajid was not on the Australian intelligence radar and Naveed and he did not affiliate themselves with any extremist groups operating from India.Telangana police's intelligence sleuths also checked on the duo's visits to Hyderabad to establish the purpose of their trips and ascertain whom they had met. After scrutiny, cops said the visits were personal and Sajid mostly remained in contact with immediate family. They also found no evidence to suggest he had visited Pakistan.The house of Sajid's brother remained under lock and key on Wednesday as well. Family members' phones were found switched off.Sajid left Hyderabad on a student visa to Australia in 1998 but did not pursue any formal education there, instead undertaking various jobs before settling as a fruit vendor. In 2000-2001, he married an Australian of Italian descent, Venera Grosso, and brought her to Hyderabad in 2001 to introduce her to his parents. Here they had a traditional nikah.He next came in 2004 to introduce son Naveed to the family in Hyderabad. When his father passed away in 2009, Sajid could not attend the funeral. ""But he came a month later and met the family in 2009,"" said a police officer.Sajid returned in 2012 to seek prospective buyers for his land and house near Shalibanda. He again visited in 2016 with Naveed to sign an agreement and dispose of the property. His last trip was in 2022 to meet family members. ""His visits were short. Each time he stayed for about a week or 10 days. In 2022, he stayed for a fortnight at Al Hasnath Colony.

The woman has been arrested.It all began on Oct 30 when the first call was received by inspector Sathish GJ, who had taken charge of the Ramamurthynagar police station. The caller, who introduced herself as Sanjana, claimed she lived in the locality. Within minutes, the conversation veered away from small talk, ending with an unsolicited declaration of love.Sathish brushed it off as a prank. However, the calls didn't stop. New numbers appeared each time old ones were blocked. By the time Sathish had blocked 11 numbers, it was clear this was not infatuation but persistence with intent. The woman demanded attention, affection, and acceptance, growing more aggressive with every rejection.When the attempts failed, pressure followed. Sanjana claimed to be a political party worker with access to the highest echelons of power. She sent photographs of herself with ministers and politicians and warned the inspector that his career could be ""managed"" up or down depending on his response.Calls even came in, claiming to represent the home minister and deputy chief minister, asking why Sathish was ""ignoring"" her complaint. The inspector said he replied, stating the woman had never formally visited the station nor filed any complaint, and that he would act only through due legal process.The woman changed tactics again. She visited the police station in Sathish's absence, introduced herself as his relative, and left behind a bouquet and a box of sweets. When informed, Sathish warned her not to misuse his name. On Nov 7, she appeared at the station and handed him an envelope stuffed with handwritten love letters, heart sketches, declarations of devotion, and antidepressant tablets. The message was explicit: reciprocate, or she would end her life after holding him responsible. When the harassment continued, he formally lodged a complaint on Nov 8.During the inquiry, police learned that Sanjana had previously targeted a police constable in Whitefield and two other men in Ramamurthynagar and KR Pura, allegedly extracting money after similar ""love"" overtures. She returned on Dec 12, abusing the inspector, demanding a secret relationship, threatening suicide and vowing to destroy his reputation.In his complaint, the inspector alleged that the woman's actions were aimed at harassment, intimidation, and possibly illegal financial gain, apart from damaging his personal dignity and the reputation of the police department. A case has been registered under the BNS sections 132 (assault or criminal force to deter a public servant from discharge of his duty), 221 (obstructing a public servant in discharge of public functions), and 351 (criminal intimidation).","Inspector Sathish GJ had taken charge of the Ramamurthynagar police station.

That's why he kept riding despite pain'

BENGALURU: In the early hours of Saturday, a young family's life shattered on a quiet Bengaluru road — a tragedy made more painful by missed chances, delayed care and the silence of passing vehicles that refused to stop.Venkataramana, a 34-year-old mechanic from Balaji Nagar in Ittamadu, Banashankari III Stage, woke up at 3.30am complaining of severe chest pain. His wife, Roopa K, immediately sprang into action.With no time to waste, she accompanied him on their scooter to a private hospital in Kathriguppe, hoping for urgent help. But help did not come.At the hospital, Roopa said they were turned away after being told that no doctor was available. At another private hospital nearby, an ECG confirmed her worst fear: Venkataramana was suffering a heart attack. Yet, according to Roopa, even there, no emergency treatment was initiated and no ambulance was arranged. She was simply advised to take her husband to Jayadeva Hospital. With fear tightening its grip and no support in sight, they did the only thing they could think of. They got back onto the scooter and rode towards the hospital.They never made it. Around 4.21am, near Kadirenahalli bridge, Venkataramana clutched his chest again. The scooter wobbled and the couple fell onto the road. Injured and shaken, Roopa picked herself up and rushed to her husband, who was struggling to breathe. What followed was perhaps the cruellest moment of the night.Roopa waved frantically at passing two-wheelers and cars, begging strangers to stop and help take her husband to the hospital. One vehicle after another passed by. No one stopped to help. Venkataramana lay on the road, gasping for breath, as precious minutes slipped away.A pedestrian eventually paused and stayed with them. Soon, Venkataramana's sister arrived at the spot and attempted to stop vehicles as well. Nearly seven minutes later, a car finally halted. By then, Venkataramana had lost consciousness. His sister tried performing CPR before they rushed him to hospital, where doctors declared him brought dead. The entire ordeal — Roopa's desperate pleas, her husband collapsing on the road, and the apathy of passersby — was later captured by a CCTV camera nearby.Banashankari traffic police have registered a case and handed over the body to the family after postmortem. Venkataramana is survived by his mother, wife, and two children. He worked in his sister's automobile shop. His sister said they have not lodged complaint against the hospital as they have already lost their brother.Roopa told the media that action must be taken against the hospitals, which she alleged, failed to provide emergency care or arrange an ambulance. She claimed that the hospital staff may have neglected her husband because of their financial condition.Expressing anguish over the public response, Roopa said the incident highlighted a growing lack of compassion.""If someone had helped us in time, my husband might have survived,"" she said through tears. ""He wanted to live. That is why he kept riding despite the pain.""Even in the depths of her grief, Roopa chose compassion over bitterness.

'Genital or bodily mutilation': US House passes bill banning gender-affirming care for minors; heads to Senate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/genital-or-bodily-mutilation-us-house-passes-bill-banning-gender-affirming-care-for-minors-heads-to-senate/articleshow/126048477.cms,"Trump Impeachment Vote: 'Your Days Are Numbered' | U.S. Cong Shocker For GOP | WATCH





WASHINGTON: The US House of Representatives on Wednesday passed a Republican-backed bill seeking to ban gender-affirming care for minors, a move that would make several medical procedures a federal crime. The legislation was approved by a narrow 216-211 vote and now heads to the Senate, where its prospects remain uncertain.The bill, sponsored by Republican lawmaker Marjorie Taylor Greene, outlaws what it describes as “genital or bodily mutilation of a minor,” a provision that would effectively prohibit gender-affirming medical treatments for transgender children. While many US states have already enacted similar bans, the measure would establish a nationwide prohibition.“This important bill...will criminalize gender-affirming care on minors, not adults, on minors who have not yet grown up to make adult decisions,” Greene said ahead of the vote.The legislation explicitly criminalises female genital mutilation but also targets surgeries intended to alter a minor’s body “to correspond to a sex that differs from their biological sex.” It further restricts certain pharmacological treatments, including the use of puberty blockers.Under the bill, anyone performing or facilitating such procedures could face up to 10 years in prison along with financial penalties.Greene described the measure as “a direct reflection of President Trump's executive order and every single Republican's campaign promise in 2024.”Former president Donald Trump campaigned aggressively against transgender-related policies during last year’s election and moved early in his second term to roll back measures recognising diverse gender identities. His administration has also sought to bar transgender people from military service and reduce funding for schools that allow transgender athletes to compete in women’s sports.Democratic lawmaker Sarah McBride, the first openly transgender person elected to Congress, criticised the bill. “All Republican politicians care about is making the rich richer and attacking trans people,” the Delaware representative told reporters outside the Capitol.Transgender rights group Advocates for Trans Equality said the legislation “attempts to strip both transgender and intersex people of their freedom to make decisions about their own bodies.” The group noted that the bill continues to allow surgeries on intersex children, describing them as “non-consensual surgeries that are actual cases of mutilation.”“The bill is not about protecting children -- it is about enforcing outdated ideas of sex and gender through coercion and violence,” said A4TE health policy analyst Sinead Murano-Kinney.",US House of Representatives passes bill seeking to ban gender-affirming care for minors.

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday (local time) addressed the nation, outlining what he described as major achievements on foreign policy, the economy, border security and domestic governance during his presidency. The 47th POTUS began his address by lashing out at his predecessor, Joe Biden for what he called the ""worst"" border crisis in US history.""We inherited the worst border anywhere in the world, and we quickly turned it into the strongest border in the history of our country,” he said.""Eleven months ago, I inherited a mess, and I'm fixing it,"" Trump said.In his address, Trump claimed credit for resolving multiple international conflicts and reshaping US global standing. “I restored American strength, settled 8 wars in 10 months, destroyed the Iran nuclear threat and ended the war in Gaza - bringing for the first time in 3000 years peace to the Middle East and secured the release of the hostages, both living and the dead,” he said.The US president also highlighted economic gains, attributing investment inflows to his trade policies. “Already I have secured a record-breaking 18 trillion dollars of investment into the United States, which means jobs, wage increases, growth, factory openings and far greater national security.Much of this success has been accomplished by tariffs; my favourite word - tariffs, which for many decades have been used successfully by other countries against us. But not anymore,” Trump said.He added that companies were increasingly shifting manufacturing back to the US. “Companies know that if they build in America, there are no tariffs. That's why they are coming home to the USA in record numbers. They are building factories and plants at levels we haven't seen,” he said.Trump also spoke about narcotics control and cultural issues, claiming sharp reductions in drug inflows. “Drugs brought in by Ocean and Sea are down 94%. We have broken the grip of sinister woke radicals in our schools,” he said, reiterating, “I've restored American Strength, settled 8 wars in 10 months, destroyed the Iran Nuclear Threat, and ended the war in Gaza—bringing, for the first time in 3,000 years, Peace to the Middle East. ”On immigration, Trump said his administration had transformed border security. “We inherited the worst border anywhere in the world, and we quickly turned it into the strongest border in the history of our country. In other words, in a few short months, we went from worst to best,” he said.The president concluded by contrasting his leadership with that of previous administrations. “For the last four years, the United States was ruled by politicians who fought only for the insiders, illegal aliens, career criminals, corporate lobbyists, prisoners, terrorists, and above all, foreign nations, which took advantage of us at levels never seen before,” Trump said. “But now, you have a president who fights for the law-abiding, hardworking people of our country—the ones who make this nation run. ”","US President Donald Trump addressed the nation on Wednesday (local time) He outlined what he described as major achievements on foreign policy, the economy, border security and domestic governance.

TikTok bullying claims surface as fans mourn Riziki Ilenre







Police in Alabama are working to piece together the circumstances surrounding the death of TikTok creator Riziki Ilenre, as questions continue to spread rapidly across social media. The Montgomery Police Department confirmed it is investigating Ilenre’s death, which occurred in mid-December, following a wave of online concern and speculation from fans who followed her closely.In the days since her passing, social platforms have filled with posts from followers searching for clarity. Many pointed to troubling moments from her online presence and raised concerns about persistent bullying. Authorities, however, have not confirmed any cause of death, and several of Ilenre’s loved ones have declined to speak publicly as the investigation remains ongoing.According to police, investigators are reviewing the facts surrounding Riziki Ilenre’s death and have not released further details. Reports circulating online suggested she may have died by suicide during a live broadcast, but law enforcement said those claims could not be verified at this time.Officials emphasized that the case remains open while they assess available evidence.Ilenre, who was originally from Chicago (as per information online), was a law student at the Illinois Institute of Technology and remained involved in her local ministry. Beyond her academic and community work, she was known to followers for her openness about mental health challenges and for sharing moments from daily life. Her bond with her service dog, Chief, often appeared in her content and resonated strongly with her audience.Friends and supporters described her as expressive and thoughtful, someone who used her platform to speak honestly rather than chase trends. That approach helped her build a loyal following who viewed her page as a place of connection rather than performance.As news of Ilenre’s death spread, many fans pointed to the pressures creators face online. Several users alleged she had been subjected to ongoing bullying.While police continue their work, fans online are urging justice.“Heartbreaking news. A tragic reminder that we never truly know the battles people are fighting behind the screen.

Wedding bells soon?

It’s not every day that an FBI director finds himself at the centre of a social-media nudge toward matrimony — but Kash Patel ’s love life is suddenly trending almost as much as his job.Patel’s country-singer girlfriend, Alexis Wilkins , appears to be waging a very public, emoji-laced “propose already” campaign, amplifying hints, reposts and playful prods that suggest she’s ready for an engagement ring sooner rather than later.The online cheerleading comes at an awkward moment for the 45-year-old FBI chief, whose relationship with the 27-year-old aspiring musician has already drawn scrutiny over his alleged use of bureau perks to visit and protect her. Still, Patel has stood firmly by Wilkins — and she seems more than happy to stand right beside him, preferably with a ring involved.On Monday Wilkins shared an X post by right-wing activist Xaviaer DuRousseau praising Patel after news of foiled New Year’s Eve bomb plots in Los Angeles.DuRousseau wrote, “God bless you @FBIDirectorKash 🙏🏾 And please propose to my friend soon 😌” Wilkins responded, “Xaviaer over here with facts 😉” She later reposted his Instagram story, adding, “Ride or D1e KING over here 🫶 @xaviaer.”Katie Miller, wife of former Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, teased Patel and Wilkins’ appearance on her podcast, asking, “Where’s her ring?” with both Patel and Wilkins laughing in the clip.Patel defended their relationship in an X post, calling Wilkins “the woman I’m proud to call my partner in life,” and “a country music sensation who has done more for this nation than most will in ten lifetimes.”Insiders told MS Now that Patel twice ordered Wilkins’s security detail to drive a friend home and in one instance shouted at the team leader to comply. News of Patel’s use of $60 million in private jet services and the assignment of SWAT agents prompted national outcry.Rumours that Patel’s position is at risk have circulated, following criticism of his handling of cases including the Brown University mass shooting. White House Secretary Karoline Leavitt dismissed speculation that Patel would be dismissed, posting a photograph of Patel with President Donald Trump from November.","Kash Patel’s country-singer girlfriend, Alexis Wilkins, appears to be waging a very public, emoji-laced “propose already” campaign.

Oil prices rose sharply on Wednesday after US President Donald Trump ordered ""a total and complete"" blockade of all sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela, stoking fresh geopolitical tensions at a time when markets are already wary about weak global demand.Brent crude futures climbed 57 cents, or 0.9%, to $59.50 a barrel by 0135 GMT, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude gained 59 cents, or 1%, to $55.86 a barrel.The rebound came a day after oil prices settled near five-year lows, pressured by progress in Russia-Ukraine peace talks. A potential deal could lead to easing of Western sanctions on Moscow, increasing supply in an already well-supplied market.Earlier on Tuesday, Trump ordered a blockade of sanctioned oil tankers linked to Venezuela and said he now regarded the country’s rulers as a foreign terrorist organisation.The move could disrupt about 0.4–0.5 million barrels per day of supply and lift prices by $1–2 per barrel, according to a US oil trader.""In regard to pricing impacts, we should see the prompt physical premiums reacting more than flat price, especially natural Merey replacements in the Gulf Coast like Canadian and Colombian Castilla blends, though the total loss of supply would be less than 200,000 barrels per day for the Chevron equity cargoes,"" Matias Togni, analyst at oil market insights firm Next Barrel, told Reuters.Another analysts said that the oil market is currently well supplied, but warned that if the blockade remains in place for an extended period, crude prices could move higher.It remains unclear how the US will enforce the blockade or whether it will deploy the Coast Guard, as it did last week. In recent months, Washington has moved warships into the region.Trump’s latest move follows the US seizure of a sanctioned oil tanker off Venezuela’s coast last week, stepping up pressure on the government of President Nicolas Maduro, whom Trump has accused of allowing drugs to enter the US.Since the seizure, Venezuela’s crude exports have fallen sharply. While many tankers lifting oil from the country are under sanctions, others transporting Venezuelan crude, as well as oil from Iran and Russia, remain unsanctioned. Tankers chartered by Chevron are also shipping Venezuelan crude to the US under a prior authorisation from Washington.","Brent crude futures climbed 57 cents, or 0.9%, to $59.50 a barrel by 0135 GMT.

Republican senator Eric Schmitt took to social media to slam the Democratic states that are trying to block the Trump administration's H1-B crackdown.In a lengthy post on X, Schmitt described how each Blue state is using the visa programme for certain reasons and hence trying to block the GOP crackdown.The MAGA senator said: ""20 Democrat states are suing the Trump Administration to block its H-1B visa crackdown. These states claim they need H-1Bs to import skilled foreign workers.

Bondi Beach shooting : 11 dead, shooters seized





As panic spread across Sydney’s Bondi Beach during a deadly shooting at a Hanukkah celebration, one man put his life on the line to stop the gunfire.His name is Ahmed al Ahmed, a 43-year-old fruit shop owner who is now being hailed as a hero for tackling and disarming one of the attackers. The heroic act was caught on camera and went viral following the shooting.Ahmed is a father of two from Sydney’s south. He was walking past the area when two gunmen opened fire near the Chanukah By The Sea, a Jewish celebration on Sunday. The gathering was held near a children’s playground and hundreds of families were there for the event.Footage online shows Ahmed, dressed in a white shirt, crouching behind parked cars as shots ring out. At the right moment, he rushed forward and grabbed one of the gunmen from behind, placing him in a headlock. After a violent struggle lasting several seconds, Ahmed wrestles the shotgun from the attacker, forcing him to retreat.In the video, Ahmed can later be seen sitting on the ground as bystanders rush to help him. A towel is brought to stop the bleeding from his leg. He was shot twice. Despite being wounded, he remains conscious and places the seized weapon against a tree.His cousin, Mustafa, spoke to 7News and said Ahmed was undergoing treatment in the hospital.“He’s in hospital and we don’t know exactly what’s going on inside,” Mustafa said. “We do hope he will be fine. He’s a hero 100 per cent.”Ahmed was reportedly due to undergo surgery and had no prior experience handling firearms. According to family members, he acted out of instinct to protect others.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the heroic act, describing it as “the pinnacle of Jewish heroism”.Police said two shooters were involved in the attack. One was shot dead at the scene, while the other was critically injured and taken into custody.Moments after Ahmed disarmed the first attacker, police moved in. An officer approached from behind the bridge and shot the remaining gunman dead. Separate footage later showed officers administering CPR to one of the suspects.At least 11 were killed in the attack. Twenty-nine others were taken to the hospital. NSW Ambulance said more than 26 resources were deployed, including helicopters and specialist paramedics. Several patients were treated at the scene, with others transported to hospitals across Sydney.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the scenes were “shocking and distressing."" He added that police and emergency services were working to save lives. Local council officials urged the public to avoid the area as investigations continued.","Ahmed al Ahmed, a 43-year-old fruit shop owner, tackled and disarmed one of the attackers.

US hits alleged drug boat with 'lethal kinetic strike' in eastern Pacific; kills 4,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-hits-alleged-drug-boat-with-lethal-kinetic-strike-in-eastern-pacific-kills-4-video/articleshow/126049457.cms,"(Screengrab from video shared by US military)

US Lethal Kinetic Strike On Drug Vessel Kills Four As Congress Probes Legality And Leadership





The US military said it carried out a strike on a vessel accused of drug trafficking in the eastern Pacific Ocean on Wednesday, killing four people, as lawmakers in Washington rejected attempts to curb President Donald Trump’s authority to use military force against drug cartels.US Southern Command said the vessel was operated by what it described as “narco-terrorists” travelling along a known trafficking route. In a post on social media, the command said a “lethal kinetic strike” was conducted against the boat, which it claimed was linked to a designated terrorist organisation engaged in narco-trafficking operations.“A total of four male narco-terrorists were killed, and no US military forces were harmed,” Southern Command said. The military did not release evidence supporting its allegations but posted video footage showing a small vessel moving through the water before an explosion.The latest incident brings the total number of known boat strikes since September to 26, with at least 99 people killed, according to figures released by the Trump administration.The strike came on the same day House Republicans voted down two Democratic-backed resolutions that would have required the White House to seek congressional authorisation before continuing military operations against drug cartels.The votes marked the first time the House has formally considered Trump’s military campaign in Central and South America. Similar measures have already failed in the Senate, where most Republicans opposed restrictions on the president’s war powers. Trump has indicated he would veto any legislation limiting his authority if it reached his desk.The administration maintains it is engaged in an “armed conflict” with drug cartels, arguing that military action is necessary to disrupt narcotics flows into the United States. Critics in Congress, however, have raised concerns about the legal basis for the strikes, the lack of transparency, and the absence of clear evidence that targeted vessels were carrying drugs.Those concerns intensified after reports that an early September strike included a follow-up attack that killed two survivors clinging to the wreckage of a destroyed boat.The boat strike forms part of a broader US military buildup across the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific, including a major naval deployment off Venezuela’s coast. Trump has also ordered a blockade of “sanctioned oil vessels” travelling to and from Caracas and overseen the seizure of an oil tanker carrying Venezuelan crude.The administration says the actions are aimed at pressuring Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and cutting off funding for drug trafficking and terrorism. Maduro has rejected those claims, arguing the campaign is designed to force regime change rather than combat narcotics.","US Southern Command said the vessel was operated by what it described as “narco- terrorists’ The latest incident brings the total number of known boat strikes since September to 26, with at least 99 people killed, according to figures released by the Trump administration.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126049444,imgsize-328320,width-400,resizemode-4/screengrab-from-video-shared-by-us-military.jpg"

Trump Confirms Ilhan Deportation Over 'BROTHER' Marriage? 'She Hates Them' | FULL SPEECH





US President Donald Trump is set to deliver a televised address to the nation Wednesday, outlining plans to strengthen America amid declining popularity over economic concerns.Trump previewed his speech to reporters, saying, ""The message this evening is we inherited a mess, and we've done a great job, and we continue to, and our country is going to be stronger than ever before very soon.""White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt also announced the speech would highlight Trump's achievements in fighting inflation and immigration, which he attributes to his predecessor Joe Biden's policies.""The president would also talk about his plans to continue delivering for the American people over the next three years,"" Leavitt said on Tuesday.Trump, the oldest elected president in US history, has consistently praised his administration's economic performance, recently giving it an ""A++++"" rating and dismissing affordability concerns as a Democratic hoax.Recent polls indicate growing public dissatisfaction with Trump's economic management, however.A PBS News/NPR/Marist poll showed 57 percent of Americans disapproving of his handling of the economy.The president also faces criticism from within his MAGA movement for prioritising international issues like peace deals in Ukraine and Gaza, and tensions with Venezuela, over domestic concerns.Recent Republican losses in local elections, including mayoral and gubernatorial races, have prompted Trump's team to shift focus toward domestic issues.The president has increased his domestic travel schedule to promote his economic message, promising to ""make America affordable again"" during a Pennsylvania visit last week, with another rally planned in North Carolina.",US President Donald Trump is set to deliver a televised address to the nation Wednesday.

FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino has reportedly told confidants that he plans to step down from his role early next year, according to MS NOW.Bongino is the bureau’s second-highest command only after Director Kash Patel . He has indicated that he will not be returning to the FBI headquarters this month.Sources told MS NOW that Bongino has considered formally announcing his departure on Friday.When asked about the reports, Bongino declined to confirm or deny them, saying, “Print whatever you’d like. No one believes you anyway. Thanks.” The FBI declined to comment on the report.Bongino is a former police officer and Secret Service agent. He was appointed to the FBI position by US President Donald Trump himself. Bongino had no prior experience within the bureau. His appointment was not taken well due to his role in conservative media and past commentary on conspiracy theories, including the January 6 pipe bomb attempt and the death of Jeffrey Epstein.Before joining the FBI, Bongino suggested that the pipe bombs planted in Washington on the eve of the Capitol riot were an “inside job.”And when Brian Cole Jr. was arrested and charged with planting the devices earlier this month, Bongino showed a different stance on Fox News and said that as a deputy director of the FBI, the investigation will be based on facrs on facts.He added: “That’s not what I’m paid for now. I’m paid to be your deputy director.”Bongino previously questioned official accounts of Jeffrey Epstein’s death of it being a suicide as a conspiracy theory. After becoming an FBI official, he confirmed that Epstein, the convicted sex offender and pedophile, had hanged himself in 2019. “I have reviewed the case. Jeffrey Epstein killed himself. There’s no evidence in the case file indicating otherwise,” Bongino said on X in May.The FBI memo released in July affirmed Epstein’s suicide and denied the existence of the rumored “client list,” drawing backlash from some members of the MAGA movement. Bongino and Attorney General Pam Bondi reportedly confronted each other at the White House over the matter.The reported timing of Bongino’s potential announcement coincides with the Friday deadline for the Trump administration to comply with a bipartisan law requiring the release of government files related to the Epstein investigations.",Bongino is the bureau’s second-highest command only after Director Kash Patel.

Trump about to wage war on Venezuela?

Conservative commentator Tucker Carlson made a startling claim that President Donald Trump may use his upcoming televised address to announce war with Venezuela.Carlson was speaking on the online show Judging Freedom. The right-winger said he was told by a member of Congress that lawmakers had been briefed ahead of Trump’s planned 9 pm address. “Members of Congress were briefed yesterday that a war [with Venezuela] is coming, and it will be announced in [Trump’s] address to the administration tonight,” Carlson said, according to a transcript shared on social media.However, he was also not sure whether the MAGA chief would actually make such an announcement of waging a full-scale war.Trump’s address comes amid sour US-Venezuela relations, where his administration has stepped up military actions against the neighbor on a questionable scale.Earlier this week, Trump ordered a full naval blockade on oil tankers entering or leaving Venezuelan waters. He described it as a response to Venezuela’s ""theft"" of US oil and other assets.The blockade is part of a bigger US military stance in the region that has included a major naval deployment in the Caribbean, airstrikes on suspected drug‑trafficking vessels, and the seizure of a Venezuelan oil tanker off the nation’s coast.US lawmakers from both parties are not sure about the scope of these operations. Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen warned that the Pentagon’s actions could be seen as probing “unauthorised acts of war. ” On the other hand, Republican Senator Rand Paul described recent moves as an “initiation of war.”Venezuela’s government has condemned the US blockade. They called it a violation of international law and a threat to regional stability.Despite Carlson’s claims, there is no official confirmation that Trump plans to declare war. Under the US Constitution, a formal declaration of war requires congressional approval, and lawmakers have already introduced resolutions to prevent military escalation without legislative authorisation.A controversial US military strike on a boat linked to Venezuelan drug trafficking occurred in mid-September, when Trump announced that American forces had carried out the operation in international waters, killing three people the administration described as “positively identified, extraordinarily violent drug trafficking cartels and narcoterrorists” heading toward the United States. Trump said the strike was ordered by him, and he posted a short unclassified video of the boat exploding at sea after the operation. This strike followed an earlier attack on September 2, 2025, which killed 11 people.",Right-winger Tucker Carlson said he was told by a member of Congress that lawmakers had been briefed ahead of Trump’s planned 9 pm address.

He is charged with murdering his parents.The 32-year-old arrived at a downtown Los Angeles courtroom on Wednesday.

The media were barred from filming him, and reporters inside the courtroom could not see him clearly as he sat out of view in a corner.His lawyer, Alan Jackson, said outside court that the case involves “complex and serious issues” that need to be addressed before proceedings move forward.The delay in entering a plea may allow time for a psychiatric evaluation for Nick, who has struggled with drug addiction for a hefty amount of time.Emergency crews were called to the Reiner home at around 3.30 pm on Sunday. Police later confirmed that both victims had suffered fatal knife wounds. Reports said a family member, reportedly the daughter, discovered the bodies, and dispatch audio revealed officers requested backup at the scene.

The Donald Trump administration, in an expected move, widened the travel ban to include more African countries from which people can't now travel to the US, even for studying. The list now has 39 countries and is effective from January 1, 2026. But there are various degrees of travel ban -- full and partial -- and a lot to decode.In July, the administration announced 12 countries that are under a full travel ban which means the US completely blocks the entry of people from these countries, no matter who they are, what their purpose of visit is. Only a very few exceptions are allowed, depending on the case. These countrymen can not apply for any visa and even if someone has a valid visa, it is considered suspended. No new visa is issued. But it does not mean that people from these countries who have obtained US citizenship will be stripped of their citizenship.Trump added seven countries to this listThis category also includesNationals from these countries will not be able to come to the US for travel purposes or to study. H-1B work visas are not suspended but consular officers have been asked to reduce the validity of any visa.Turkmenistan got some restrictions lifted as its nationals can now apply for B, F, M and J categories of visa.People who are inside the US with a valid visa on or before January 1, 2026 are exempt from the travel ban. Existing visas will not be revoked. Athletes, coaches traveling for the World Cup, Olympics are exempt as determined by the State Department.""Fiancé visas (K-1) are being treated like immigrant visas (generally non-immigrant) for the proclamation. So if you are filing for a fiancé in one of the 39 banned countries, they are being treated like spouses of US citizens and they are also banned,"" immigration attorney Brad Bernstein said.","The Donald Trump administration widened the travel ban to include more African countries.

Thailand said it is open to a diplomatic solution but Cambodia has to cease hostility first before negotiations. Thai forces on Saturday said they had destroyed a bridge that Cambodia used to deliver heavy weapons and other equipment to the region and launched an operation targeting pre-positioned artillery in Cambodia’s coastal Koh Kong province.Trump said he spoke to Thailand’s caretaker Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul and Cambodian premier Hun Manet on Friday, and said they had agreed to “cease all shooting”.The main issue between Thailand and Cambodia is over territory. The most sensitive area is around ancient temples such as Preah Vihear and other nearby sites, which both countries claim as culturally and nationally important. After years of intermittent tension, serious skirmishes first broke out in July 2025 following a deadly clash near the border. Both sides blamed the other for initiating violence.

Her remarks, measured but often blunt, sketch a governing circle defined by conviction, confrontation and competing ideas of power. At the centre sits Wiles herself, operating quietly, allowing strong figures to clash in public while she manages the internal balance behind closed doors.Wiles’s assessment of Vice President JD Vance is among her most striking. She is reported to have said that Vance “has been a conspiracy theorist for a decade”, framing his worldview as long-standing rather than newly adopted. The comment suggests scepticism about his intellectual grounding and the sources that shape his politics.She also implied that Vance’s journey from Trump critic to loyal ally was politically driven, tied to his Senate ambitions rather than a sudden ideological conversion. In Wiles’s telling, the evolution was calculated, reflecting ambition and opportunity more than persuasion.Wiles describes Trump as having “an alcoholic’s personality”, despite the fact that he does not drink.By this, she means a temperament marked by compulsion, excess and an unshakeable belief that limits do not apply to him. Trump, she suggests, is fuelled by intensity and grievance, with a deep memory for perceived slights.She portrays him as someone who will pursue retribution if he sees an opening, whether against former officials or political adversaries. This instinct, she implies, is not chaotic but conditional, activated when Trump believes the moment is right.Marco Rubio emerges as a figure Wiles clearly trusts. Her description is spare but revealing. She says Rubio is someone who simply “won’t” abandon his principles, adding, “And so he had to get there.” The phrasing suggests persuasion rather than opportunism, patience rather than ambition.Rubio’s value lies in fluency. He understands Washington’s institutional language and can translate Trump’s instincts into terms that bureaucracies and allies still recognise. In an administration suspicious of process, that ability makes him indispensable.Stephen Miller is named as part of Wiles’s core team and then largely left unexplained. There is no extended quote dissecting his ideology or temperament, and the absence feels intentional. Miller does not require justification inside Trumpworld.His role is assumed, embedded and permanent. In this case, silence functions as description. He is a constant presence, neither questioned nor contextualised, reflecting how deeply his influence is woven into the administration’s machinery.Wiles treats Kash Patel and Dan Bongino with more nuance than outright praise or dismissal. She acknowledges that they “really appreciated what a big deal this is” because they “lived in that world”, recognising their instinctive grasp of the emotional charge surrounding national security and institutional mistrust.At the same time, she draws a clear line between conviction and accuracy. Wiles notes that Patel pushed for disclosures for years based on assumptions that “turn out not to be right”. In her telling, belief alone is not evidence, and certainty does not guarantee truth.Wiles is sharply critical of Attorney General Pam Bondi’s handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files. She is reported to have said Bondi “completely whiffed” the rollout, particularly in how expectations were set among audiences eager for revelations.According to Wiles, Bondi initially delivered “binders full of nothingness” and later suggested that key documents or lists were ready for release when they were not. The episode, in Wiles’s view, damaged credibility and inflamed distrust within the administration’s own base.Her remarks about Elon Musk are among the most unsparing. Wiles is reported to have described Musk as an “avowed ketamine user” and an eccentric whose actions often left her “astounded”. She portrays him as hyperactive and difficult to restrain.Musk, she suggests, has a habit of breaking systems first and worrying about consequences later. While that approach may work in technology and business, Wiles implies it proved destabilising inside government, forcing others to manage fallout after decisions were already made.Across all these portraits, Wiles positions herself not as an enforcer or ideologue, but as an organiser. She allows aggressive loyalists and strong personalities to operate publicly while she remains largely off-camera, intervening selectively and strategically.The picture that emerges is of a White House driven by belief, grievance and ambition, with Wiles acting as the steady hand holding it together. Her comments offer a rare, unvarnished map of how power actually functions inside Trump’s inner circle.",White House chief of staff gives candid interview to Vanity Fair.

‘Might Never See Him Again’: Imran Khan’s Sons Claim 'Psychological Torture' In Pak's Adiala Jail





Pakistan police on Wednesday registered a case under the Anti-Terrorism Act against the sisters of former prime minister Imran Khan and dozens of his supporters after a protest sit-in outside Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi.The protest on Tuesday was held after authorities refused to allow family members and lawyers to meet Khan, who is currently incarcerated. His sisters, along with leaders and workers of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), staged the sit-in outside the jail to protest the restriction.Police said a first information report (FIR) was lodged at Police Station Saddar Beroni, Rawalpindi, naming Khan’s sisters Aleema Khan and Noreen Niazi, as well as several PTI leaders and supporters. Those named include Salman Akram Raja, Naeem Panjotha, Qasim Khan, Aliya Hamza and Raja Nasir Abbas.Authorities also invoked Section 120 of the Pakistan Penal Code for alleged criminal conspiracy against the state, along with charges of attacking police personnel and violating Section 144.Police said, as reported by PTI, at least 14 suspects were arrested at the scene late Tuesday night, and efforts are continuing to arrest others named in the FIR.Imran Khan has been in jail since August 2023 and faces multiple cases filed after his removal from office in April 2022.Officials have placed restrictions on meetings with Khan, saying such visits are being used for political purposes. The last meeting with him took place on December 2, when his sister Uzma Khan was allowed to see him.","Police register a case against the sisters of former prime minister Imran Khan and dozens of his supporters after a protest sit-in outside Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi.

Trump Puts Asim Munir On Gaza Test: Can Pak Army Chief Appease U.S & Avoid Backlash At Home?

'Pressure to deliver'

Munir's unprecedented power

Risks at home





Pakistan's de facto state head and most powerful army chief in decades is facing the toughest test of his expanding stronghold in Islamabad power centre as the United States presses Islamabad to send troops to a Gaza stabilisation force, a move analysts told Reuters could spark strong domestic backlash. It could also ""annoy the US president"" if Munir shows disinterest in contributing to the peace plan.Military chief Munir, who holds enormous influenceover Pakistan's political and economic decisions, is expected to travel to Washington in the coming weeks to meet US President Donald Trump . It would be their third meeting in six months and is likely to focus on Pakistan's possible role in Gaza, according to two sources familiar with the matter, one of whom is closely involved in Munir’s economic outreach to the US.Trump's proposed 20-point plan for Gaza calls for troops from Muslim-majority countries to oversee a transition period focused on reconstruction and economic recovery in the Palestinian territory. Gaza has been devastated by more than two years of Israeli military bombardment.Many countries are cautious about joining such a force because it could involve disarming Hamas, Gaza's Islamist militant group. Analysts say this risks pulling foreign troops deeper into the conflict and could inflame pro-Palestinian and anti-Israeli public opinion at home.Munir, however, has developed close ties with Trump as part of an effort to repair years of strained relations between Washington and Islamabad. In June, Trump hosted Munir for a private lunch at the White House — the first time a US president met Pakistan’s army chief alone, without any civilian leaders present.""Not contributing (to the Gaza stabilisation force) could annoy Trump, which is no small matter for a Pakistani state that appears quite keen to remain in his good graces - in great part to secure U.S. investment and security aid,"" said Michael Kugelman, Senior Fellow, South Asia at the Washington-based Atlantic Council.Pakistan is the world's only Muslim-majority country with nuclear weapons and has a powerful, experienced military. It has fought three wars with rival India, a brief conflict earlier this year, and has long battled insurgencies in its remote regions. It is also currently fighting Islamist militants that it says operate from neighbouring Afghanistan.Because of this military capability, expectations are higher for Pakistan to contribute, said defence analyst and author Ayesha Siddiqa.Pakistan’s military strength means ""there is a greater pressure on Munir to deliver his capacity,"" she said.Pakistan’s military, foreign office and information ministry did not respond to Reuters’ questions. The White House also did not reply to a request for comment.Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said last month that Pakistan could consider contributing troops for peacekeeping, but made clear that disarming Hamas was not Islamabad’s responsibility.Earlier this month, Munir was appointed chief of the defence forces, placing the army, air force and navy under his command. He also received a job extension until 2030.Under constitutional amendments passed by Pakistan’s civilian government last month, Munir will retain his field marshal rank for life and enjoy lifetime immunity from criminal prosecution.""Few people in Pakistan enjoy the luxury of being able to take risks more than Munir. He has unbridled power, now constitutionally protected,"" Kugelman said.In recent weeks, Munir has met leaders from Indonesia, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Jordan, Egypt and Qatar, according to military statements. Siddiqa said these meetings appear aimed at consulting Muslim countries on the proposed Gaza force.At home, however, the biggest risk is political unrest. Any deployment of Pakistani troops to Gaza under a US-backed plan could revive protests by Islamist parties that strongly oppose the US and Israel.These groups have the ability to bring thousands of supporters onto the streets.In October, authorities banned a powerful and violent Islamist party known for pushing Pakistan’s strict blasphemy laws. Officials said its leaders were arrested, more than 1,500 supporters detained, and its assets and bank accounts seized. Despite the ban, analysts say the group’s ideology still has influence.Supporters of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, whose party won the most seats in the 2024 elections, are also deeply hostile to Munir and could mobilise against him.Abdul Basit, Senior Associate Fellow at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, warned that any escalation after deployment could quickly spiral.""People will say 'Asim Munir is doing Israel's bidding' - it will be foolhardy of anyone not to see it coming.""",Pakistan's de facto state head and most powerful army chief in decades is facing the toughest test of his expanding stronghold in Islamabad power centre.

Mistook bomb for toy: Blast at Pakistan school in Waziristan; two children killed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/mistook-bomb-for-toy-blast-at-pakistan-school-in-waziristan-two-children-killed/articleshow/125926997.cms,"



Two children have been killed and more than a dozen others injured in a blast at a seminary in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in an incident that has deepened anxiety in a region already struggling with insecurity.Police said the explosion occurred in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali area at about 2pm after students brought a mortar shell into Madressah Shams-ul-Quran, having mistaken it for a toy they found outside, Dawn reported.The device detonated while the children were playing with it, killing two instantly and injuring 16 others. Several of the wounded were later transferred to hospitals in Bannu and nearby districts.Local officials said security forces had earlier warned residents that an unexploded mortar had landed in the area and urged civilians to avoid it. However, the warning did not reach everyone, and the children unknowingly carried the device into the seminary, as per Dawn.The incident came amid growing concern about public safety in North Waziristan, which on the same day saw a separate overnight attack that destroyed a government primary school in Mir Ali. Officials said explosives were planted at the building in Ayaz Kot, leaving more than 600 children without a place to study.Much of the structure was reduced to rubble, prompting authorities to seal the site and begin planning temporary arrangements for classes.Parents and elders condemned the destruction as a deliberate assault on the community’s future. One elder said the school had been “the heart of our community”, describing its loss as an attack on children’s hopes, Express Tribune reported.Security forces have launched a search operation, though no group has claimed responsibility. District officials called the bombing an “anti-education act” and promised those responsible would be brought to justice. Initial assessments suggest the explosives were detonated remotely or with a timer.","Two children killed and more than a dozen others injured in blast at a seminary in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Heavy-handed military operations risk alienating local populations and driving recruitment, while political engagement with some groups risks being seen as appeasement. International implications India, Iran, and even China watch these internal Trojan horses with varying stakes. India’s support to Baloch separatists, Iran’s concerns about Baloch unrest along its border, and China’s economic interests in Balochistan add layers of strategic complexity.

Conventional approaches falter

Military campaigns may suppress one group temporarily but provide recruits and sympathy to another.

Political negotiations get undermined when factions splinter or external events shift local calculations—such as the Taliban’s victory in Afghanistan.

Economic development efforts in Balochistan are hampered by ongoing violence but are critical to addressing root causes.

Cross-border sanctuaries and international gray zones complicate decisive action.

Multi-pronged strategy

Enhanced Border Security and Regional Diplomacy Strengthening border management with Afghanistan and Iran, paired with robust diplomatic engagement, can limit militant sanctuaries and cross-border flows.

The challenges Pakistan faces today are often described in binary terms — a threat here, a conflict there — but the reality is far more chaotic and intricate, much like the scientific conundrum known as the ""three-body problem"". This problem, rooted in physics and celestial mechanics, deals with predicting the motions of three gravitational bodies interacting with each other. The paradox is that while two bodies' orbits can be predicted with relative simplicity, introducing a third body creates a system so unstable and non-linear that exact forecasts become practically impossible. Pakistan's existential security dilemmas resemble this dynamic complexity: three powerful, interrelated forces that simultaneously influence and destabilize the country’s internal and external equilibrium.These three forces are the Taliban , the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ), and the Baloch insurgency.Individually, each represents a serious security threat. Collectively, their interactions generate overlapping, tangled challenges that confound policy, military strategy, and diplomatic efforts.Recent escalations are a stark reminder of this peril. In October 2025, Pakistan launched airstrikes in Kabul and other Afghan sites targeting TTP leader Noor Wali Mehsud, prompting Taliban retaliation on Pakistani border posts and further Pakistani precision strikes killing dozens of militants.Meanwhile, Baloch attacks surged 53% in 2024 to 938 incidents with over 1,002 fatalities, spilling into 2025 with high-profile hits on CPEC projects.Over 300 attacks rocked Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2025 alone, mostly TTP-led.For the first time since 2015, the number of terror attacks in Pakistan crossed the 900-mark.Grasping their interplay is crucial to understanding why Pakistan’s security apparatus struggles to restore stability — and why conventional approaches have so far failed.The Taliban, an Islamist militant group born in Afghanistan in the mid-1990s, rose to international prominence with its capture of Kabul in 1996.Following the US invasion after 9/11, the group was ousted but persisted with insurgency tactics. The Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan in 2021 reshaped regional dynamics and profoundly impacted Pakistan.For Pakistan, the Taliban's ascendance is something of a double-edged sword. On one hand, Islamabad sees the group as a strategic asset to exert influence in Kabul and counter Indian presence in Afghanistan. On the other hand, the Taliban's ideological affinity with Pakistan's own Pashtun tribal regions and cross-border networks complicates Islamabad's control over militancy within its own borders.The Taliban's ideology and governance style also inspire elements within Pakistan, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the tribal belt. This ideological inspiration runs parallel to fears that the group's Afghan governance failures or hardline policies could spill over, destabilising Pakistan’s own tribal regions.The Afghan Taliban's 2021 takeover initially promised Pakistan leverage against India, but it backfired spectacularly. Kabul's refusal to dismantle TTP sanctuaries hosting 6,000-6,500 fighters armed with leftover NATO weapons has fueled Islamabad's woes. Tensions peaked in December 2025 with heavy cross-border fire exchanges killing five Afghans, amid soured ties since 2021.Experts like Tahir Khan note the Taliban's inaction strains relations, pushing Pakistan to airstrikes that risk radicalising more TTP factions toward rivals like ISKP. Failed Istanbul peace talks in October 2025 saw Pakistan threaten to ""obliterate"" the Taliban regime after unmet demands on TTP expulsion. Sirajuddin Haqqani dismissed TTP as Pakistan's ""internal matter,"" vowing forceful responses to violations.This dynamic grants TTP ""strategic depth"" unparalleled in its history, enabling mergers and centralisation under Mehsud. As analyst Hazrat Ali warns, Pakistani pressure on Kabul could splinter TTP, worsening regional chaos.Pakistan’s newly appointed armed forces chief Gen. Asim Munir recently called on Afghanistan’s Taliban government to choose between maintaining ties with Islamabad or supporting the Pakistani Taliban.Munir said that a “clear message” had been delivered to the Taliban government in Kabul: it must decide between Pakistan and “Fitna al-Khawarij,” a term authorities use for the outlawed Pakistani Taliban, known a s Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan.While the Afghan Taliban exerts influence across the border, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan represents a homegrown, highly violent insurgency directly challenging the Pakistani state’s writ. Originating as an umbrella militant organisation around 2007, the TTP embodies a coalition of various Islamist militants and tribal groups united against Islamabad's military operations.The TTP has been responsible for some of the deadliest terrorist attacks in Pakistan over the past decade, targeting military installations, government buildings, schools, and civilian populations. Despite several attempted peace negotiations, the TTP's fractured yet resilient network has shown a capacity to regroup, regrouping largely within the tribal regions of northwestern Pakistan and even spilling across the Afghan border during periods of instability.The group opposes Pakistan’s state institutions vehemently and views the military, intelligence agencies, and secular political frameworks as existential enemies. Unlike the Afghan Taliban, which now nominally controls Kabul, the TTP pursues a more violent, confrontational agenda rooted in the Pakistani context.The TTP roared back post-Taliban victory. In 2024, it drove over half of 900+ attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, killing 560+, with 67% targeting security forces. By 2025, its operations hit 600+ confrontations, surpassing all of 2024.A stark October 8, 2025, ambush in Kurram killed 11 Pakistani soldiers, including two officers, via roadside bombs and heavy weapons—exposing border vulnerabilities.TTP now eyes tribal belt control, mirroring Afghan Taliban's path, per CTC West Point analysis. Mehsud's unification of splinters has boosted recruitment, with propaganda invoking Baloch grievances to broaden appeal.Security data shows 96% of attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, blending armed assaults and IEDs, as TTP demands military divestment from businesses. This resurgence, analysts say, stems from Afghan havens, turning Pakistan's past militant proxies into monsters.Simultaneously, Pakistan faces an insurgency in Balochistan—a sprawling, resource-rich, but underdeveloped southwestern province. The Baloch nationalist movement goes back decades, demanding greater autonomy, resource control, and sometimes outright independence. The insurgency has fluctuated in intensity but remains a persistent thorn in Islamabad’s side.Baloch militants have targeted Pakistani security forces, infrastructure projects, and economic installations such as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)—a flagship regional development initiative. The province's rugged terrain and Baloch tribal dynamics create a challenging environment for Pakistani counterinsurgency efforts.Unlike the religious militancy of the Taliban and TTP, the Baloch insurgency is rooted in ethnic nationalism and grievances over political marginalization, economic neglect, and human rights abuses. This ideological and geographical distinctiveness makes it harder for the Pakistani state to craft a unified internal security strategy.Attacks ballooned to 327 sites across 25 districts in 2024, with 80% fatality spike to 1,002+. The March 11, 2025, Jaffar Express hijacking by BLA-Jeeyand killed 26 hostages and kidnapped 400+, showcasing tactical evolution from hit-and-runs to coordinated ops.CPEC remains prime target: Operation Dara-e-Bolan in January 2024 and March 2025 barrages hit Chinese workers, amid Israel-Iran and India-Pakistan tensions stoking fears of wider nexuses. BLA's sophistication targets BRI, militarizing the region further.Unlike TTP's jihadism, Baloch fights for autonomy, but heavy state crackdowns alienate locals, per CTC analysis. Injuries rose to 689, property losses to 546, signaling expanded reach despite counter-ops killing 76 insurgents.Here lies Pakistan’s three-body problem: the Taliban, TTP, and Baloch insurgency don’t operate in isolation.Their influences collide, interact, and ripple across Pakistan’s geopolitical landscape in unpredictable ways.Traditional counterinsurgency and counterterrorism strategies rely on clear, identifiable enemies that can be neutralised through military might, intelligence operations, or negotiated settlements. The three-body dynamic, however, forces Pakistan to wrestle with fluid, overlapping, and at times contradictory challenges.In essence, each ""body"" in this problem pulls Pakistan’s security landscape in different directions, making any single policy or operation insufficient.Addressing this three-body problem requires Pakistan to adopt a holistic, integrated strategy that acknowledges the distinct yet intertwined nature of these challenges.Pakistan's military has intensified operations since mid-2025 to counter the Taliban-TTP-Baloch nexus, focusing on intelligence-based strikes (IBOs), cross-border actions, and sustained ground campaigns amid over 1,000 attacks nationwide. These efforts emphasize decapitation of TTP leadership, border denial, and Baloch insurgency suppression, though resource strains from multi-front threats limit gains.The army launched precision airstrikes into Afghanistan targeting TTP hideouts. On October 9, 2025, raids hit Kabul, Khost, Jalalabad, and Paktika, aiming at TTP chief Noor Wali Mehsud's headquarters, killing dozens of militants despite his survival claim. Retaliatory Taliban attacks on border posts prompted further Pakistani strikes on October 11-12, neutralizing Taliban brigades and TTP operatives.Recent IBOs in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa yielded kills: December 5-6 saw nine TTP fighters eliminated in Tank and Lakki Marwat districts. September 13 clashes in South Waziristan and Lower Dir killed 35 militants but cost 19 soldiers, highlighting ambush risks. December 6-7 Chaman border strikes destroyed three Taliban bases, killing 23 fighters after ceasefire violations.Operation Azm-e-Istehkam, ramped up in summer 2025, reports near-daily TTP neutralizations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, addressing a terrorism surge to highest levels since 2015.In Balochistan, May 2025 operations deployed over 40 vehicles in Surab, Zehri, and Khuzdar, declaring areas ""sensitive"" to hunt Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) amid 70+ attacks under Operation Herof. August 30 actions post-BLA civilian strikes killed five insurgents and captured two in Kech, part of Azm-e-Istehkam's escalation.Security forces targeted BLA convoys, camps, and intelligence squads, seizing arms despite BLA claims of 25 blockades and 15 camp captures in 2024-2025. These ops focus on CPEC protection, countering 938 incidents with 1,002 fatalities in 2024 extending into 2025.The ongoing volatility reveals that no single strategy will yield a definitive victory; instead, Pakistan must adopt nuanced, integrated policies that combine hard military pressure with political dialogue, regional diplomacy, and socioeconomic inclusion.The future of Pakistan’s sovereignty and regional peace depends on how skillfully it navigates this chaotic three-body problem, turning a disordered struggle into a managed equilibrium before the forces pull the nation into further unrest and fragmentation.","Pakistan’s western tribal belt and Balochistan both border Afghanistan and Iran, turning these regions into transnational conflict zones. There is evidence of ideological and tactical cross-pollination between the Afghan Taliban and the TTP. The Baloch insurgency, while largely ethnonationalist, has occasionally sought indirect or tactical alliances with other groups to magnify its impact.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125834167,imgsize-1257718,width-400,resizemode-4/pakistan39s-three-body-problem.jpg"
Pakistan ex-ISI chief jailed: Faiz Hameed convicted after court martial; handed 14 years in prison,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-ex-isi-chief-jailed-faiz-hameed-convicted-after-court-martial-handed-14-years-in-prison/articleshow/125908182.cms,"Uncertainty Over Pakistan’s Top Military Post Could Trigger Conflict: Analyst





A Pakistani military court has sentenced former inter-services intelligence (ISI) director general Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hameed to 14 years in prison after a 15-month-long court-martial on multiple charges, including political interference and violations of the official secrets act.The Field General Court Martial, held under the Pakistan army act, found Hameed guilty on four counts - engaging in political activities, misuse of authority and state resources, violation of the official secrets act, and causing wrongful loss to individuals. The military did not identify who suffered such losses. Officials said Hameed was provided full legal rights and representation during the proceedings. He retains the right to appeal.Hameed, once considered a close confidant of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan , had been detained in 2024 after an internal investigation linked to the Top City housing project near Islamabad. Until Thursday's announcement, neither the charges nor details of the probe had been formally disclosed by the government or the military.Security analyst Syed Muhammad Ali told AP that the verdict followed “a lengthy investigation that gave the former ISI chief ample opportunity to defend himself.”He added: “The decision signals the military leadership’s intent that no officer, regardless of rank, will be allowed to engage in politics, and Hameed’s case has been made an example for all retired officers.”Hameed’s downfall marks a rare instance of a high-ranking former military official facing such a stiff sentence in Pakistan, where the army holds significant institutional influence and senior-level prosecutions are uncommon.His political proximity to Imran Khan had long drawn attention. Khan - who was ousted in 2022 through a no-confidence vote and has since criticized the military and political leadership for his removal - is serving multiple jail terms on graft and other charges. The military, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s government and the US have all denied Khan’s claim that they engineered his exit.","Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hameed sentenced to 14 years in prison.
