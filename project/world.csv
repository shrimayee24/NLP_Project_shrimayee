However, Rana repeatedly challenged the decision in American courts.His appeals against extradition were rejected by lower courts, and in August 2023, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that the India-US Extradition Treaty allowed for his extradition. Rana then filed a petition with the US Supreme Court to block the decision. The US Solicitor General urged the court to reject his plea, reinforcing the US government's stance in favor of India's extradition request.On January 25, the US Supreme Court denied Rana’s final petition, effectively clearing the way for his extradition to India. With this ruling, Rana is now set face trial in India.","Tahawwur Rana, a Canadian citizen of Pakistani origin, is accused of involvement in the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed 166 people, including six Americans.

A mourning ritual turned into community feast in celebration



PRAYAGRAJ: To the list of superstitions linked with 'unlucky' 13 has been added the lucky coincidence of a presumed Maha Kumbh stampede victim from Prayagraj trudging back home this Tuesday to find the neighbourhood commemorating his 'tehrvi' - the ritual performed on 13th day after a death.Turns out 60-something Khunti Guru , nonplussed at the fuss over his rumoured death in the Jan 29 stampede, had had one chillum of ganja too many with some sadhus and lost track of time.Almost two weeks would go by before he remembered that his 10x12 room in Chahchand Gali of Prayagraj's Zero Road was waiting for him. By then, Khunti Guru's extended family comprising almost the entire locality had organised elaborate religious rituals in memory of the much-loved local jester.""I slept rather long... could be a few days,"" the 'Dead Man Walking' said, responding to the barrage of questions and curious looks that greeted his arrival. Khunti Guru's tehrvi was quickly forgotten in the euphoria of seeing him alive, but not the food. What was meant to be a mourning ritual turned into community feasting in celebration of the popular, happy-go-lucky character's 'rebirth'.Abhai Awasthi, a social worker, said Khunti Guru, stepped out on the evening of Jan 28, telling whomever he met in Chahchand Gali that he would be back after a dip at Sangam on Mauni Amavasya .""The stampede happened early the next day and we got worried about him. We looked for him everywhere we could but there was no trace of him. Finally, presuming him dead, we organised prayers for him,"" Awasthi told TOI.Just as the rituals were nearing completion, a familiar figure alighted from an e-rickshaw. ""Our beloved Khunti Guru asked us smilingly, ""What are you people up to?' It's hard describing how we felt,"" Awasthi said.Locals say his father, Kanhaiyala Mishra, was a reputable lawyer. Not much is known about what happened to the family but Khunti Guru apparently didn't complete his education and stayed back in the area.The room he now lives in is apparently what remains of the Mishra family's ancestral home. Shopkeepers in the neighbourhood give him food and clothing in return for their daily fix of gossip, peppered with anecdotes delivered in Khunti Guru's inimitable style. ""Although he has a bed in his room, Khunti Guru prefers sleeping in the compound of a local Shiva temple,"" a resident said.",'Dead Man Walking' Khunti Guru returns home to find neighbourhood commemorating his 'tehrvi' - the ritual performed on 13th day after a death.

Statement of suicide victim's father weakens prosecution argument



CHENNAI: One girl, two suitors. But the unspoken battle for her loyalty simmered beneath the surface until it boiled over and the 19-year-old engineering student in Tamil Nadu's Kattankulathur town ended her life on July 14, 2014.The tragedy sent the two men accused of abetting her suicide into a decade-long legal battle, only to be acquitted for lack of evidence this February 10. E Sumithra, a first-year student at a private college, was found dead in her bedroom by her parents. Her death followed a heated confrontation between her fiance M Anandhan and her close friend K Ilayaraaja.Victim Sumithra's fiance M Anandhan and her close friend K Ilayaraaja had expressed romantic interest in her.Sumithra was engaged to Anandhan, a classmate and relative, with family approval. However, Ilayaraaja, a neighbour and long-time friend, also proposed marriage. Though she declined his proposal, she remained in touch with him, leading to tensions between the two men.On the night of July 13, Anandhan and Ilayaraaja had a heated argument near the college, requiring bystanders to intervene. That night, both called Sumithra repeatedly, allegedly pressuring her to sever ties with the other. The calls allegedly continued from midnight until 6am. The next morning, she was found dead.Police conducted an inquiry and filed an abetment case against Anandhan and Ilayaraaja, then aged 23 and 24. However, when the case went to trial at Chengalpet Mahila Court, Judge M Ezhilarasi found serious gaps in the prosecution's claims.In his complaint, Sumithra's father Ezhumalai said: ""I do not know why my daughter took her life."" His statement weakened the prosecution's argument that harassment drove her to suicide.Sumithra's close friend Vaishali, a key prosecution witness, denied in court that she had expressed distress about being pressured by the two men. The prosecution also failed to produce crucial call detail records (CDR) to verify the claim that both men had pressured Sumithra over the phone that night. Without this evidence, the court ruled that the allegations remained unproven.After a trial spanning nearly 10 years, the court acquitted both Anandhan and Ilayaraaja, citing lack of credible evidence, call records or witnesses supporting the abetment charge. Yet, beyond the walls of justice, in the stillness of a home that once echoed with a daughter's laughter, one question lingered unanswered: What truly happened that night?","E Sumithra, a first-year student at a private college, was found dead in her bedroom by her parents.

Rajat's lover's family files plaint, accuses him of poisoning her

MUZAFFARNAGAR/ROORKEE: It was a cold December night in 2022 when Rajat Kumar and Nishu spotted a crumpled Mercedes - upside down, smouldering - near Roorkee on Delhi-Dehradun highway. They didn't know then that the man they pulled from the wreckage, half-conscious and bleeding, was cricketer Rishabh Pant . They called the police and stayed on till help arrived. Pant later said they were ""heroes who helped me... I'll be forever grateful and indebted"".Months after Pant gifted him a scooter as a token of gratitude, Rajat is fighting for his life in a hospital, accused of a crime he insists he didn't commit. On Sunday, Rajat, 25, and his girlfriend Manu Kashyap (21), consumed poison together. Their love was not meant to last - different castes, disapproving families, marriages arranged elsewhere.In despair, Rajat and his lover made a suicide pact , or so it seemed. A resident of their village, Buchha Basti, spotted them writhing on the ground and raised the alarm. By the time their families arrived, much damage was done. They were rushed to a local hospital. Manu's family transferred her to another facility, where she died before dawn on Tuesday, while Rajat, barely clinging to life, is still in treatment.Then, hours after Manu was cremated, her mother walked into Purkazi police station and filed a murder complaint against Rajat, accusing him of poisoning her daughter.Now, the village that once took pride in Rajat's bravery whispers about scandal. In a place where ""family honour"" is currency, a young man and woman trying to defy caste and family expectations is not just a personal crisis - it is a communal one.Muzaffarnagar SP Satyanarayan Prajapat said no police case had been filed until Manu's mother intervened. The local police have turned their attention to Manu's mother's allegations.

Kennedy Jr's weird tryst with animals



RFK Jr will be the health secretary of the country -- as President Donald Trump wanted -- following the Senate's confirmation Thursday. The 71-year-old Kennedy Scion is a prominent lawyer and a vocal vaccine critic but he refuses to call him an anti-vaxxer as his family members are all vaccinated. RFK Jr was an independent presidential candidate against Kamala Harris and Donald Trump until he suspended his campaign to endorse Trump.Kennedy Jr has been confirmed in 52--48 votes with every Democrat and McConnell voting against him. Republican Mitch McConnell who voted against defense secretary Pete Hegseth, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard again voted against Kennedy Jr.Ahead of the vote, minority leader Chuck Schumer said Kennedy is not remotely qualified for the job. “Robert F Kennedy Jr is not remotely qualified to become the next secretary of health and human services. In fact, I might go further. Robert F Kennedy Jr might be one of the least qualified people the president could have chosen for the job,” Schumer said.""If the Senate had a secret ballot, I bet you that Robert F Kennedy Jr would never have come close to confirmation,"" Schumer said.In line with Donald Trump's Make America Great Again slogan, RFK Jr raised a Make America Healthy Again pledge in which he promised to cut out junk and ultra-processed food from the American diet and ban other harmful chemicals and additives. He said he would not ban junk food as his boss Donald Trump is a fan of them but would enforce healthier oil for frying.Kennedy Jr acknowledged several incidents that involved wild animals mostly because he's very interested and experimental about them. Kennedy Jr once beheaded a dead whale that had washed up on the shores of Squaw Island as he wanted to study its skull. He then tied the whale to the top of his van and took it home. Another weird incident involved a dead bear and the Central Park of New York. He said he saw a bear get hit and killed by a car in front of him. He planned to take it home but as he got engaged in some other work and could not head home, he left the bear in Central Park.","Kennedy Jr has been confirmed in 52--48 votes with every Democrat and McConnell voting against him.

He suggested that these efforts are part of a broader initiative to influence public opinion and destabilise governments.Benz said that ""celebrities who can be trained to spread desired messaging"" are actively recruited and used as ""network nodes."" He cited NATO-linked initiatives and USAID-backed music diplomacy programs as key drivers behind these efforts. ""Taylor Swift has worked in various things before that have been empirically shown to move the needle on government initiatives,"" he said, referring to her involvement in voter engagement and public health campaigns.He also pointed to the Pentagon’s involvement in the music industry, alleging that military funding has played a significant role in shaping cultural narratives. ""Look at who the biggest sponsor of South by Southwest is in Texas now. It’s the military. Go ahead and look up the scandal if you want about South by Southwest Pentagon funding. They've taken over the music industry because it’s hearts and minds work,"" Benz said.According to Benz, the US government has used similar tactics worldwide, particularly through USAID’s music diplomacy program. ""Just like they were giving Dua Lipa the awards, just like they’re working with Pussy Riot, just like they have 22... In fact, you can look this up if you want—the State Department Music Diplomacy Program. Twenty-two rappers. You’ll see again, these people become network nodes. They become assets to play with.""He further claimed that USAID has supported artists in various countries to promote anti-government sentiment. ""There’s evidence to suggest the same play around recruiting hip-hop artists in Cuba,"" Benz said. ""It was protest rock, it was protest rap. In Cuba, for that USAID operation, it was protest rap.""He referenced a report from The Grayzone, which allegedly revealed that US-backed programs in Bangladesh had commissioned rap songs designed to incite street protests and political reform. ""Those documents that The Grayzone published have two rap songs in Bangladesh with lines like they were designed to inspire anti-government sentiment and to promote street protests and political reform. I mean, literally writing rap albums to get people to take to the streets and pull off the exact riot that the State Department wants to destabilise the country.""In response to a video discussing these claims, Benz reiterated that the State Department had recruited 22 artists from various countries, including Australia, Austria, Bangladesh, Cameroon, France, India, and South Africa, to train them in ""youth engagement and using art as activism."" The program involved bringing these musicians to Washington, DC, for an intensive training period.However, a community note on social media disputed Benz’s claims, stating that the only known connection between USAID and Dua Lipa was its funding for a music school in Kosovo. The note detailed how USAID supported the launch of Allegra School of Arts in Gjakova, aimed at providing formal musical education to Kosovan youth.Benz’s comments come amid heightened scrutiny of US foreign influence programs, particularly under the Trump administration. Recently, Elon Musk has also criticised USAID and other agencies, calling for their dismantling. Musk suggested that organisations like the National Endowment for Democracy have failed in their stated missions, asking, ""How much democracy have they achieved lately?""","Former US official Mike Benz claims USAID has trained musical artists to act as ""assets"" in spreading political narratives for statecraft purposes.

You will see that it does not refer to the entire Gulf, but to the continental shelf,” she said.Despite Mexico sending an official letter to Google, the tech giant has stood by its decision. Google said last month that its policy is to apply name changes when they have been updated in official government sources.The name of the Gulf on Google Maps varied based on the user’s location. In the United States, it appeared as the ""Gulf of America,"" while in Mexico, it remained the ""Gulf of Mexico."" In many other regions, both names were shown as ""Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America)."" Apple has also updated its maps to display the new name for US users.Sheinbaum has repeatedly defended the name ""Gulf of Mexico,"" noting that its use dates back to at least 1607 and is recognised by the United Nations . She has also pointed to historical maps from before 1848, when the US seized a third of Mexico’s territory, as evidence of the region’s historical ties. In response to Trump’s move, she has jokingly suggested that Google rename the US as ""Mexican America"" when searched.Mexico and the US have a long history of disputes over geographic names.The border river between Texas and the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas is another example—Mexico calls it the ""Río Bravo,"" while in the US, it is known as the ""Rio Grande.""The renaming has also sparked outrage beyond Mexico, with Indigenous groups in Alaska condemning Trump’s decision to revert Denali to Mount McKinley.Sheinbaum has made it clear that Mexico will not back down. “If they continue to insist, we will too,” she said. “We are even thinking of a lawsuit, because they are even naming Mexican territory, which is our continental shelf.”","Mexico has warned it may take legal action against Google over its decision to rename the Gulf of Mexico.

Trump's plan to 'own Gaza'

Turkey, North Korea and Houthis condemn Trump

Israel-Hamas war

Hamas has announced on Thursday it will release three more Israeli hostages, easing tensions over the ceasefire deal in Gaza. The militant group had earlier threatened to delay the handover, accusing Israel of failing to meet its commitments, including allowing essential supplies into the region.Israel, backed by newly elected US President Donald Trump, had warned it would resume fighting if the hostages were not freed. With Hamas confirming the release will go ahead.Israel’s defence minister Israel Katz also issued a stark warning on Wednesday, declaring that “all hell will break loose” if the militant group fails to release hostages as scheduled this weekend.Hamas said it had engaged in discussions with Egyptian officials and was in contact with Qatar’s prime minister over bringing more shelters, medical aid, fuel, and heavy equipment for clearing rubble in Gaza. The group claimed mediators had assured them that obstacles to aid delivery would be removed.Shortly after Hamas' announcement, spokesman Abdul Latif al-Qanou confirmed to The Associated Press that the hostages would be freed on Saturday as part of the existing ceasefire agreement. Egypt’s state-run Qahera TV reported that mediation efforts by Egypt and Qatar had successfully resolved the dispute.As negotiations continue, Trump's proposal to relocate Gaza’s 2 million Palestinians to other countries has sparked debate. The US president has repeatedly claimed that America will ""own Gaza"".Israel has welcomed the idea, but it has been rejected by Palestinian leaders and Arab nations, who refuse to absorb refugees. Human rights groups have warned that such a move could constitute a war crime under international law.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with top military and security officials on Thursday, discussing the situation at the army’s Southern Command headquarters near the Gaza border.His far-right allies are pushing for a return to war once the first phase of hostage exchanges concludes, aiming to implement Trump’s plan and crush Hamas, which still controls the territory after months of devastating attacks.Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan criticised Trump’s approach, saying it threatens global peace.“To tell the truth, I do not find Mr Trump’s behaviour in the past period and his current statements and challenges to many countries in the world to be right, and I do not see these as a positive development,” Erdogan told an Indonesian television anchor.Meanwhile, Yemen’s Houthi leader Abdul-Malik Al-Houthi issued a warning, threatening military action if the plan proceeds.“We will never remain passive in the face of such an aggressive plan against the Palestinian people,” he said in a televised speech.North Korean state media has strongly criticised the US, accusing it of “slaughter and robbery” over Trump’s plan to take control of the Gaza Strip and remove its more than two million Palestinian residents.“The world is now boiling like a porridge pot over the US’ bombshell declaration,” the Korean central news agency (KCNA) said in a statement on Wednesday.The war began on October 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages. More than half have since been released through deals or rescues, but 73 remain in captivity, with around half believed to be dead.According to Gaza's health ministry, over 48,000 Palestinians have been killed, most of them women and children. Israel claims to have killed more than 17,000 militants but has not provided evidence.Israel’s military campaign has left vast areas of Gaza in ruins. The war displaced 90% of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents. Many have returned since the ceasefire, only to find destruction—rubble, human remains, and devastation.Despite the ceasefire, violence has continued. Gaza’s health ministry reported that Israeli fire has killed at least 92 Palestinians and wounded over 800 since the truce began. The Israeli military said it had targeted individuals who entered restricted areas or approached its forces in violation of the agreement.","Hamas confirms it will release three more Israeli hostages on Saturday.

In almost all cases, countries charging us vastly more than we charge them: Trump

WASHINGTON: Hours ahead of his meeting with PM Modi, US President Donald Trump inked plans Thursday for sweeping ""reciprocal tariffs"" hitting both allies and competitors, in a dramatic escalation of an international trade war that economists warn could fuel inflation at home.The president signed a measure directing the US Trade Representative and Commerce secretary to propose new levies on a country-by-country basis in an effort to rebalance trade relations - a sweeping process that could take weeks or months to complete, according to a senior White House official, leaving no clear date when they would take effect.Trump named India in his announcement, saying the country had more tariffs than nearly any other nation.Fresh import taxes would be customised for each country, meant to offset not just their own levies on US goods but also non-tariff barriers the nations impose in the form of subsidies, regulations, value-added taxes and other factors that act to limit US trade, said the official prior to the announcement. AgenciesI've decided, for purposes of fairness, that I will charge a reciprocal tariff, meaning whatever countries charge the United States,"" Trump said in the Oval Office. ""In almost all cases, they're charging us vastly more than we charge them but those days are over.""Reciprocal tariffs would be the president's latest step to rework American trade relationships. When it comes to high tariffs, India - like many other developing countries - is often cited as an offender. Trump has repeatedly criticised the high tariffs India charges on American goods, like Harley Davidson motorcycles.Earlier this month, India tried to head off those criticisms by announcing it would voluntarily drop tariffs on certain US products, including motorcycles.""Major exporting nations of the world attack our markets with punishing tariffs and even more punishing non-tariff barriers,"" Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro told reporters, taking aim at EU in particular over VAT.Washington will start by examining economies with which United States has its biggest deficits or ""most egregious issues"", said a White House official. Trump acknowledged Thursday that US prices ""could go up"" due to tariffs, but he expressed confidence that they would ultimately ease.Trump has announced a broad range of tariffs targeting some of the biggest American trading partners since taking office, arguing that they would help tackle unfair practices - and in some cases using the threats to influence policy. A White House official said US has been ""treated unfairly,"" saying a lack of reciprocity is a reason behind its ""persistent annual trade deficit in goods"".","US President Donald Trump inked plans for sweeping ""reciprocal tariffs"" hitting both allies and competitors.

But a record of trafficking in dangerous conspiracy theories and eroding trust in public health institutions does not entitle Mr Kennedy to lead these important efforts,"" he said.“This Administration – led by the same President who delivered a medical miracle with Project Warp Speed – deserves a leader who is willing to acknowledge without qualification the efficacy of life-saving vaccines and who can demonstrate an understanding of basic elements of the U.S. healthcare system. Mr Kennedy failed to prove he is the best possible person to lead America’s largest health agency. As he takes office, I sincerely hope Mr Kennedy will choose not to sow further doubt and division but to restore trust in our public health institutions,” McConnell concluded.Kennedy Jr has controversial health takes and he himself was a former addict.

Akaash Singh , the Indian-American stand-up comedian known for his sharp wit and unapologetic humor, has come out strongly in support of fellow comedians Beer Biceps (Ranveer Allahbadia) and Samay Raina.Amid growing online controversy, Singh took to social media to clarify his stance, stating unequivocally that he endorses the jokes of these comedians and all stand-up comics in India.The comedian, who gained widespread recognition for his stand-up special Gaslit and his interview with former US President Donald Trump on Flagrant, did not hold back in defending his peers. Singh’s statement came after several online users criticized Allahbadia and Raina, accusing them of vulgarity and inappropriate humor. In response to a challenge by a user who questioned whether he would openly endorse such humor, Singh tweeted: “Was this not clear? I endorse the jokes of @ReheSamay, @BeerBicepsGuy, and EVERY comedian in India. And to my Indian fans who ask why I only do pop-up shows there, this story is why. I gotta weed out morons like the ones offended by this COMPLETELY harmless joke.”His comments highlight the ongoing tension between artistic freedom in comedy and the growing scrutiny from audiences who feel certain content crosses a moral or cultural line. In India, where stand-up comedy has grown rapidly in the last decade, comedians frequently find themselves at the center of controversy over their material. Many have faced legal challenges, social media outrage, and calls for censorship. Singh’s statement signals his belief that comedians should not be policed for their humor.The debate intensified when another Twitter user suggested that vulgarity should be heavily fined in stand-up and OTT content, proposing penalties of Rs. 5 crore per offensive word. Singh responded with an expletive-laden rebuttal:“Suck my d**** you dumbass m*********.”The blunt response from the comedian, known for his no-filter approach, further fueled the conversation about where the line should be drawn in comedy. Supporters of Singh applauded his defense of free speech, while critics argued that he was endorsing unnecessary crudeness in the art form.Another user accused Singh of supporting “filthy” comedians like Ranveer Allahbadia, to which he simply replied, “Nah.” The straightforward dismissal reflected Singh’s unwillingness to engage in moral policing and his commitment to standing by his peers.Adding to the discussion, Singh also defended Allahbadia directly, tweeting: “@BeerBicepsGuy is family. I don’t know what people are coming after him for and I don’t give a f***. I’m riding with him.”With his influence in both American and Indian comedy circles, Singh’s vocal stance reinforces a larger global conversation about the role of comedy in challenging societal norms. Whether or not his words will shift opinions remains to be seen, but one thing is certain—Akaash Singh isn’t backing down.Samay Raina is a well-known stand-up comedian and chess streamer in India. He rose to fame after winning Comicstaan , a popular Indian stand-up comedy competition, and later carved a niche for himself by merging comedy with chess streaming on platforms like YouTube. Raina, like many other comedians, frequently uses satire and observational humor in his performances.However, Indian comedians often find themselves in controversy due to cultural sensitivities and the country’s strict laws on speech. Even jokes that would be considered mild in American comedy can sometimes spark outrage, leading to social media backlash, police complaints, and even legal trouble. While Raina has not faced serious legal consequences, he has been criticized for his jokes, particularly by more conservative audiences who argue that comedy should remain “clean.”Ranveer Allahbadia, known as Beer Biceps, is a social media influencer, YouTuber, and entrepreneur. He initially gained popularity through fitness content before transitioning into self-improvement, business advice, and long-form podcasting. His podcast, The Ranveer Show, has hosted numerous high-profile guests, from Bollywood celebrities to spiritual leaders, and has positioned itself as a mix of motivational content and deep conversations.Recently, Allahbadia has faced criticism for some of his interviews and comments. While the specifics of the controversy are somewhat scattered, it generally revolves around accusations that he spreads misinformation or engages in sensationalist content for engagement. Some online users also disapprove of the guests he invites, including figures from polarizing political or spiritual backgrounds.","Akaash Singh, the Indian-American stand-up comedian, has come out strongly in support of fellow comedians Beer Biceps (Ranveer Allahbadia) and Samay Raina.

Tulsi Gabbard Latest News: Mitch McConnell only Republican to vote against Trump's director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/mitch-mcconnell-only-republican-to-vote-against-trumps-director-of-national-intelligence-tulsi-gabbard/articleshow/118187541.cms,"Mitch McConnell is the only Republican who voted against Tulsi Gabbard

Former Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell was the only Republican who voted against the confirmation of Tulsi Gabbard as the director of national intelligence, though his 'no' vote did not impact Gabbard's confirmation as she was confirmed in a 52-48 vote. All 47 Democrats voted against Gabbard.McConnell said he did not vote for Gabbard as he was concerned that Gabbard refused to label Edward Snowden as a traitor. “Edward Snowden’s treasonous betrayal of the United States and its most sensitive lawful intelligence activities endangered sources, methods and lives,” McConnell said in a statement after the vote. McConnell said it would be risking to “empowering a DNI who only acknowledged the value of critical intelligence collection authorities when her nomination appeared to be in jeopardy.”McConnell voted on Monday in favor of a procedural motion to advance Gabbard’s nomination to a final up-or-down vote.McConnell also voted a 'no' on defence secretary Pete Hegseth forcing Vice President JD Vance to break the tie and confirm him in his new position.Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer made an appeal to the senators to reject Gabbard on the ground that she lacked the judgment and qualifications to lead the intelligence officials around the world.“I feel so strongly I just wanted to make one last plea to my Republican colleagues,” Schumer said before the vote. “We simply cannot in good conscience trust our most classified secrets to someone who echoes Russian propaganda and falls for conspiracy theories,” he said.Republicans slammed McConnell and called for his removal from the Senate. ""Mitch McConnell voted against Tulsi Gabbard. The guy is a walking corpse. Why has his family not retired him?

He is a great friend of mine for a long time... We have, I think, some very big things to talk about. Number 1 is, they are going to be purchasing a lot of our oil and gas.

I have said that this is not a time of war in front of the media when President Putin was with me. Even today, my conviction is that the solutions to war cannot be found on the battlefield, and ultimately, we have to be at the table.

Before that, at least 300 Pakistanis had drowned in a migrant boat that sank off Greece in June 2023, with Italy their intended destination.In a travel alert, Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has identified Libya as one of 15 transit countries used for human trafficking.Each year, thousands of Pakistanis pay traffickers large sums for risky and illegal journeys to Europe, hoping to find work and send money back to their families. Many also take these perilous routes to escape conflicts and religious persecution.Pakistani authorities claim human smugglers send migrants seeking illegal entry into Europe to Libya, located around 300km from Italy. From there, they either take them by boat to Europe or relocate them to the coastal cities of Morocco and Mauritania in west Africa.On Monday, UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said it was “deeply alarmed” by the dozens of migrants’ bodies found in mass graves in southeastern Libya.

ISLAMABAD: At least 16 Pakistanis died and 10 others are unaccounted for after a boat carrying dozens of Europe-bound migrants sank at the weekend off the coast of Libya , officials said Tuesday.The ministry of foreign affairs said that 33 of the 37 survivors were in Libyan police custody and one was being treated at a hospital. An estimated 65 people were on the boat, it said.Prime minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed his deep grief and sorrow for those lost in the capsizing in Marsa Dela port in the western city of Zawiya.Sharif ordered the foreign ministry to complete the process of identifying the victims and provide assistance to those affected. He also ordered action against those involved ""in heinous acts like human trafficking,"" according to a statement.Most of the victims came from Kurram, a district in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan , where hundreds of people have been killed in recent years in sectarian clashes.""People try to travel to Europe through illegal means because of unemployment"" at home, said Javed Hussain, a nephew of Shehzad Hussain, one of the victims. He said mourners were gathering at the homes of those who perished in the latest tragedy.In January, authorities said dozens of Pakistanis died when a boat capsized off West Africa. Some of the survivors later accused smugglers of killing 43 migrants in a dispute over payment. Pakistan has since confirmed the deaths of 13 of its nationals.Hundreds of Pakistanis die every year while trying to reach Europe by land and sea with the help of human smugglers. They also use dangerous land and sea routes to reach Europe in an effort to find jobs.Libya, which has borders with six nations and a long shore on the Mediterranean, was plunged into chaos following a Nato-backed uprising that toppled and killed longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. Since then, the oil-rich country has emerged as the dominant transit point for migrants fleeing war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East for Europe.At least 674 migrants were reported dead and more than 1,000 missing off Libya in 2024, according to the International Organization for Migration's missing migrants project. More than 21,700 migrants were intercepted and returned to the chaos-stricken country.In 2023, the IOM reported 962 migrants dead and 1,563 missing off Libya. Around 17,200 migrants were intercepted and returned to Libya that year, it said.Those who are returned are held in government-run detention centers rife with abuses, including forced labor, beatings, rapes and torture - practices that amount to crimes against humanity, according to UN-commissioned investigators. The abuse often accompanies attempts to extort money from the families of the imprisoned migrants before releasing them or allowing them to leave Libya on traffickers' boats to Europe.","At least 16 Pakistanis died and 10 others are unaccounted for after a boat carrying dozens of Europe-bound migrants sank off Libya.

Pakistani lawyers stage protest against high-level meeting of constitutional body to pick eight SC judges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-lawyers-stage-protest-against-high-level-meeting-of-constitutional-body-to-pick-eight-sc-judges/articleshow/118118105.cms,"Representative image (Image credits: ANI)

ISLAMABAD: Hundreds of lawyers on Monday staged protests in Pakistan's national capital against a high-level meeting of a constitutional body with the agenda to appoint at least eight judges of the supreme court. The judicial commission of Pakistan (JCP) meeting was being held despite opposition by four apex court judges, the legal fraternity, resistance by opposition the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf and controversy over the recent transfer of judges to the Islamabad high court (IHC), which was opposed by five IHC judges.The JCP, a top body empowered to approve judicial appointments, will finalise appointments for eight vacant supreme court judges.Lawyers gathered at various locations in Islamabad, with the lawyers' action committee staging a protest near D-Chowk. But police responded by closing several key entry points to the Red Zone, which houses key buildings, including the supreme court.Dozens of protestors gathered at Serena Chowk as they were stopped from going to the supreme court due to the closure of the Red Zone. They chanted ""Azaadi"" (freedom) and ""Lawyers' unity zindabad"" (long live lawyers' unity). They were also holding a banner written in Urdu and reading "" 26th constitutional amendment unacceptable"".Clashes were also reported between lawyers and police when they tried to enter the Red Zone. However, there was no report of any arrest or injury during the protest.The protest led to the suspension of metro bus services on multiple routes between Islamabad and Rawalpindi, causing significant inconvenience for commuters. The closure of the Red Zone has caused traffic disruptions, leading to heavy congestion on different roads in the capital.Earlier, the legal fraternity in the country was already expressing concerns against the new appointments and transfers following the controversial 26th constitutional amendment passed last year.The lawyers' representatives had held a convention at the Islamabad district courts, opposing the 26th amendment and demanding the cancellation of the JCP meeting.They also announced on February 3 to protest against the transfer of three high court judges to the IHC but it could not elicit a widespread response. The Karachi bar association had supported the strike call by staying away.Last month, the Lahore high court bar association (LHCBA) moved an application before the apex court through advocate Muhammad Waqar Rana, seeking postponement of the JCP meeting.The JCP earlier this month asked all high courts to send a list of five senior judges from each for consideration for the appointment of eight of them to the supreme court.Initially, the IHC had forwarded the names of three judges - chief justice Aamer Farooq, justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani and justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb - to the JCP because justices Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri and Babar Sattar did not meet the minimum requirement of five years of service.However, as justice Sarfraz Dogar was made the IHC senior puisne judge following his transfer there from the Lahore high court, his name has also been sent to the JCP.Days before justice Dogar's name was added, five judges of the IHC approached chief justice Yahya Afridi and IHC chief justice Aamer Farooq to reclaim their seniority.Separately, four SC judges, senior puisne judge justice Mansoor Ali Shah, justice Munib Akhtar, justice Ayesha Malik and justice Athar Minallah, in a letter to the chief justice showed concerns last week and are also seeking the postponement of today's JCP session until a decision is made on the petitions against the 26th Amendment.The opposition PTI party in a letter to the chief justice on Sunday asked to postpone the commission's meeting.The 13-member JCP is led by the chief justice and includes four judges of the apex court, as well as parliamentarians from both the treasury and opposition and others.The lawyers and opposition allege that the government was trying to 'pack' the top judiciary with hand-picked judges to influence the fate of political cases, a concern rejected by the government.","Hundreds of lawyers stage protests in Islamabad against high-level meeting of constitutional body.

Pakistan: Terrorists kill 3 cops in Pakistan's volatile Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/terrorists-kill-3-cops-in-pakistans-volatile-khyber-pakhtunkhwa/articleshow/117993406.cms,"ISLAMABAD: At least three cops were killed and six injured Thursday after nearly a dozen militants stormed a police check post at Karak district in Pakistan’s restive northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province, officials said.Although no group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack, suspicion is likely to fall on Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which has frequently targeted police and security personnel in the province.“The terrorists opened fire from all sides at the check post in Karak’s Bahadur Khel area, targeting police personnel using light and heavy weapons in an attempt to capture it. Policemen at the checkpost offered stiff resistance in an encounter which lasted two hours, following which the terrorists fled,” the provincial police said in a statement.Pakistan has experienced an escalation in militancy in KP, adjacent to Afghanistan, following the collapse of a tenuous truce between TTP and the state in Nov 2022.Pakistani authorities have linked the surge in militant violence to cross-border incursions from Afghanistan, alleging that the Kabul administration is facilitating TTP fighters, a claim Afghan authorities refute. Most of these assaults have been directed at security and law-enforcement personnel, although civilians and govt officials have also been impacted.In KP’s Dera Ismail Khan district last week, four soldiers were killed by gunfire and an improvised explosive device (IED) unleashed by terrorists.In Balochistan, another restive province in Pakistan’s south, 18 soldiers were killed in an attack by terrorists earlier this month.Islamabad think-tank Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) has described 2024 as the most lethal year for security forces in a decade, with a minimum of 685 military and police fatalities resulting from 444 terror attacks.Alongside such attacks, militants have stepped up targeted killings and kidnappings of officials in KP and Balochistan.","Nearly a dozen militants stormed a police check post at Karak district in Pakistan’s restive northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province.

UN agencies raise alarm over Pakistan's move to deport thousands of Afghans waiting to go to the US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/un-agencies-raise-alarm-over-pakistans-move-to-deport-thousands-of-afghans-waiting-to-go-to-the-us/articleshow/117956288.cms,"Afghan refugees hold placards to discuss their situation after Trump paused US refugee programs, in Islamabad (Image credits: AP)

ISLAMABAD : The UN refugees and migration agencies on Wednesday expressed their concern over Pakistan 's decision to deport thousands of Afghan refugees awaiting relocation to the United States and elsewhere.The UN refugee agency, UNHCR , and the international organization for migration in a statement said they were seeking clarification from Pakistan, which said last week it would deport the refugees back to Afghanistan unless their cases were processed quickly by the countries that had agreed to take them in.About 20,000 Afghans were approved for resettlement in the US under a program that helps people at risk because of their work with the American government, media, aid agencies and rights groups. They were among tens of thousands of Afghans who fled to neighboring Pakistan after their country fell to the Taliban in 2021.However, they were left in limbo after President Donald Trump paused US refugee programs last month.""A UNHCR-issued non-return advisory has been in place since 2021, calling for a suspension of forced returns of Afghan nationals from any country regardless of their status,"" the joint UNHCR-IOM statement said.Pakistan's prime minister Shehbaz Sharif last week gave the green light to evict Afghans without papers from the cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi before March 31, in preparation for deportation if they were not relocated to their host countries.UNHCR and IOM said they are especially concerned for Afghan nationals who face a risk of harm upon return, such as ethnic and religious minorities, women and girls, journalists, human rights activists, and members of artistic professions like musicians and others.It said since January 1, 2025, an uptick in arrests of Afghan nationals in Islamabad and Rawalpindi has caused significant distress, with reports of Afghan nationals of various documentation statuses being rounded up.The Trump administration also announced the US refugee admissions program would be suspended from January 27 for at least three months. It has shocked Afghans who were hoping to travel to the United States soon.Afghans in Pakistan have been virtually living in hiding since 2023 when a crackdown began on foreigners who are in the country without proper documentation. An estimated 800,000 Afghans have either gone back voluntarily or been deported since despite criticism from UN agencies, rights groups and the Taliban.Besides thousands of Afghans who are living in Pakistan and awaiting travel to host countries, there are around 1.45 million Afghan nationals registered with UNHCR as refugees in Pakistan as well but their stay has been extended until June.In the statement, UNHCR and IOM urged ""Pakistan to implement any relocation measures with due consideration for human rights standards, including due process, and the legal status of proof of registration (POR) and afghan citizen card (ACC) holders, who have resided in Pakistan for an extended period of time"".""Pakistan has a proud tradition of hosting refugees, saving millions of lives. This generosity is greatly appreciated,"" UNHCR representative in Pakistan Philippa Candler said.""IOM is committed to work with the government of Pakistan and UNHCR to develop a mechanism to register, manage and screen Afghan nationals in Pakistan,"" said IOM chief of mission, Mio Sato.She said ""This will open the door to tailored solutions including international protection to those in need and pathways for Afghan nationals, with long-standing socioeconomic and family ties in the country.""","UN refugees and migration agencies express concern over Pakistan's decision to deport thousands of Afghan refugees.
