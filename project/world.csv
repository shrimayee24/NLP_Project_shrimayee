With the body of a youth killed in Manipur’s Kuki-dominated Kangpokpi on March 8 finally handed over to his family, authorities there said Wednesday they expect protests and blockade in the district to end soon.However, the road to lasting peace in the restive state may be a long way off. Ongoing talks between the Kuki-Zo community and Centre’s interlocutor A K Mishra are unlikely to make much headway with the former sticking to its demand for a “separate hill state” after hiving off Meitei-dominated Valley areas.The demand, which goes against the Constitutional framework, will not be acceptable to the Centre.Govt also does not seem keen to concede to the Kuki demand for a separate administrative framework for the tribal-dominated hilly regions either, recognising that it can fuel the demand for a separate state, besides giving fillip to separatist tendencies in the strategically crucial border state.Still, efforts would be to stay engaged with both Meitei and Kuki-Zo communities, while tactfully persuading the latter to settle for a solution within the four corners of the Constitution, including granting them more autonomy and preserving their unique culture, heritage and language.Sources said the district magistrate and superintendent of police of Kangpokpi had been engaging with Kuki-Zo protestors over the past few days to persuade them to accept the body of the local killed during protests on March 8, amid clashes between them and security forces.The killing had triggered further tension with Kuki-Zo protestors ordering a shutdown, apart from blocking roads and stopping the movement of vehicles. “The blockade call was given for all areas with a significant Kuki-Zo population. But its effect was seen largely in Kangpokpi. However, the talks between the local administration and community representatives have made headway, with the family of the deceased protester taking back his body for last rites,” said a Manipur govt functionary.A senior Manipur police functionary shared that a total 4,500 weapons, including those looted after ethnic violence broke out in Manipur in May 2023, were now back with police. Of these, around 1,050 were surrendered by rebels in response to a call given by Governor Ajay Bhalla.“The remaining weapons were recovered in raids and searches undertaken over time by police and security forces. These raids shall continue, now that the deadline set by the governor to voluntarily surrender weapons has ended,” said the functionary.Manipur MP Bimol Akoijam protested in Lok Sabha that his question about the state was removed from the list of questions after having been listed initially. He raised the issue in Lok Sabha during the zero hour. Jagdambika Pal, who was in the chair, denied permission to raise the issue. “This issue cannot be raised here,” he said. Akoijam has been raising issues related to the state which is affected by ethnic strife for around two years. His office, however, refused to answer what the issue was about.","The body of a youth killed in Manipur’s Kuki-dominated Kangpokpi on March 8 finally handed over to his family on Wednesday.

I am talking about something that predates Islam by at least 2,000 years,"" Adityanath said, asserting that Sambhal represents ""historical truth.""He further said that the evidence of these events has existed for centuries, pointing out, ""Remember, in 1526, a temple of Lord Vishnu in Sambhal was demolished. Two years later, in 1528, the Ram temple in Ayodhya was destroyed.""The chief minister added that both temple demolitions ""were carried out by the same person.""Since last November, tensions have been rising in Sambhal following a court-ordered survey at a mosque believed by some to be the site of a demolished temple.During his address, Adityanath emphasized that he respects all communities and sects. ""I am a Yogi. I respect every sect, community, and form of worship. If you visit Gorakhnath Peeth, you will see that there is no discrimination against anyone. People of all castes, regions, and sects sit together and eat from the same plate, and all sadhus, regardless of their religious affiliations, have meals together and receive equal respect,"" he said.Adityanath also said that Sambhal has always been a pilgrimage site, mentioning that it had 68 sacred places, out of which 18 have been ""reclaimed"". ""There were 19 ancient wells, which we have revived. After 56 years, for the first time, there was the ritual offering of water at Lord Shiva's temple in Sambhal,"" he added.He criticized opposition parties, questioning their role in preserving cultural and religious heritage. ""What were these so-called leaders doing all this time? They have only been busy dividing people in the name of religion and caste,"" he said.Meanwhile, on Sunday, Adityanath had said,Adiyanath made this remark while backing Sambhal CO Anuj Chaudhary's statement. Chaudhary, while talking to reporters, said, ""Holi is a festival that comes once a year, whereas Friday prayers take place 52 times a year. If anyone feels uncomfortable with the colours of Holi, they should stay indoors on that day.""On November 19, 2024, the Sambhal civil judge senior division ordered an urgent survey of a mosque after considering an application from some Hindu activists. The activists claimed that the Islamic religious site, built during the reign of Mughal emperor Babur, was originally a Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu's prophesied avatar, Kalki.Following the court’s directive, a survey team led by advocate commissioner Ramesh Raghav conducted an initial inspection of the mosque within a few hours. On the morning of November 24, the team arrived for a second round of photography and videography.However, violence erupted that day in the lanes near the Shahi Jama Masjid during the tense second survey, resulting in the deaths of at least five Muslim men.","Yogi Adityanath: If anyone wants to read Friday prayers, they can do so at their home.

The search operation lasted two days, with villagers assisting the police. According to officials, Gade made multiple suicide attempts while hiding but failed each time due to a broken rope. He was ultimately captured after leaving his hiding spot in search of drinking water.Upon his arrest, Gade was produced in court following a 12-day police custody. The crime branch sought his judicial custody while reserving the right to recall him for two additional days of police custody.

LUCKNOW: Posters of Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath at a rally in Kathmandu to welcome former Nepal king Gyanendra Bir Shah has created a flutter in the Himalayan country, though the ties of its erstwhile monarchy with Gorakhsh Peeth, headed by Yogi, is centuries old.The Shah dynasty , which ruled Nepal till monarchy was abolished in May 2008, calls itself Gorakhpanthi, or the follower of Guru Gorakhnath. Yogi was even called by the pro-monarchy group in 2015 to address a rally in Kathmandu, where he had made a strong pitch for reinstatement of Nepal’s ‘ Hindu nation ’ status.“Nepal has 82% Hindus, and a significant number of them revere Nath sect’s Guru Gorakhnath and his spiritual mentor, Guru Matseyndranath. For them, the Communist dispensation and China’s growing influence has not been conducive, leading to clamour for restoration of monarchy as well as Nepal’s status as a Hindu nation,” said a political analyst.Pradeep Bikram Rana, who claimed to have waved the Yogi poster at the Sunday rally, reached Gorakhpur on Tuesday. He claimed he was being persecuted by the authorities in Kathmandu, forcing him to flee. Rana admitted to idolising Yogi as a symbol of Hindu pride. “The connection between Nepal’s former ruling dynasty and Gorakhsh Peeth is very old,” says Dwarika Tiwari, who has been looking after the mutt’s administration since 1972. King Birendra, who was assassinated along with his entire family in 2001, shared a strong bond with Mahant Avaidyanath , Yogi’s guru.“Even today, when monarchy has ended in Nepal, an offering of Rs 10,000 during Makar Sankranti, Rs 5,000 on first king’s birthday and Rs 5,000 on Dussehra is sent by the royal family to Goraksh Peeth . The temple sends ‘prasad’ to the family through a representative every year,” Tiwari told TOI. “There is a legend that Guru Gorakhnath had blessed Prithvi Shah — considered the first king of modern Nepal — when he was a boy that his empire would flourish and expand wherever he would go. It is after this that Nepal, which was divided into several provinces, was unified.”","The Shah dynasty, which ruled Nepal till monarchy was abolished in May 2008, calls itself Gorakhpanthi.

NEW DELHI: The post-mortem reports of three youths from J&K’s Kathua, who were found dead three days after they went missing, have not revealed any gunshot wound or physical assault, ruling out a “terrorist attack” angle.The trauma injuries , including to their heads, point to their death by “accidental fall from a height,” said sources.Sharing this, sources in the J&K govt also told TOI that two more minors, who went missing from the same district — they were reported by their family as missing only a couple of days ago though they have been gone since Feb 28 — had an argument with their family and possibly left home to work elsewhere on daily wages.This, the sources said, has happened before with the cousins, aged 12 and 15 and both herders, staying away from their family home for days to do daily-wage jobs. The police are making enquiries with their relatives and past employers to trace them.As per the post-mortem reports of the three Kathua residents — identified as Darshan Singh, 40, Yogesh Singh, 32, and Varun Singh, 15 — whose bodies were discovered on March 8 in a gorge next to a waterfall, the cause of their death was trauma and head injury, purportedly caused by their accidentally slipping in the dark, down a rocky gorge. A backpack carried by one of them got stuck on a branch as they fell. A mobile used by them was also recovered from the spot. A liquor bottle with half of its contents consumed was found, pointing to possible inebriated state of the two adults.“Their viscera reports are now awaited for further insight into the cause and circumstances of the deaths,” said a source.Interviews with the family members of the three deceased persons, who were on their way to a wedding in Lohai Malhar, revealed that they were in touch with them over phone till the evening of March 5 and had even communicated that they had lost their way while moving with wedding party. However, a couple of hours later their phones were found to be switched off.","Post-mortem reports of three youths from J&K’s Kathua, who were found dead three days after they went missing, have not revealed any gunshot wound or physical assault.

"Who is Joshua Riibe, 24-year-old 'person of interest' linked to missing Indian-origin Sudiksha Konanki's disappearance",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-joshua-riibe-24-year-old-person-of-interest-linked-to-missing-indian-origin-sudiksha-konankis-disappearance/articleshow/118943611.cms,"Who is Joshua Riibe?



Joshua Steven Riibe, a 24-year-old tourist from Iowa, was the last known person to see Sudiksha Konanki before her mysterious disappearance in Punta Cana.

Originally from Rock Rapids, Iowa, Riibe is a former wrestler and football player at Central Lyon High School and a senior at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota, according to his LinkedIn profile.

He had traveled to the Dominican Republic for a spring break trip and was a fellow guest at the same Caribbean resort.

Riibe told police that when he woke up from his stupor, Konanki was nowhere to be found, according to Dominican news outlet El Nacional, which cited authorities.

Authorities have not clarified whether Riibe and Konanki knew each other before meeting on the island.

He ""has been interviewed at length,"" Thomas Julia, spokesperson for the Loudoun County sheriff's office, where the missing student resides, told Fox News Digital.

Julia emphasised that Ribe faces no accusations of wrongdoing in what remains ""still a missing person case , not a criminal case.""

, not a criminal case."" ""Sheriff [Michael] Chapman wants to make sure the investigation is comprehensive and includes all possible assets and techniques. We are working closely with the FBI on all of this, and they are working with the Dominican National Police,"" Julia added.

What does the surveillance footage reveal?

According to the Dominican Republic National Police, surveillance footage showed Konanki, a 5 feet 3 inches tall woman with black hair and brown eyes, walking with Riibe and friends towards the beach area at approximately 4.15 am on Thursday.

The footage captured Konanki ""clinging"" onto Ribe at the Caribbean resort, as they proceeded onto the beach.

Reports indicate that whilst Konanki and her friends were at the beach, most of the group decided to return to their hotel, leaving her on the beach with her male companion, as reported by Dominican media.

What happened next remains unclear. According to Noticias SIN, Riibe has allegedly provided three different accounts to authorities.

Authorities believe the pre-med student likely drowned after entering the ocean wearing a brown bikini, with reports suggesting she left her clothing on a beach chair.

Initially, he told police he became ill from the rough surf, returned to shore, and checked on Konanki before leaving.

In a second version, he claimed he felt sick to his stomach, left the water, and last saw her standing in knee-deep surf before passing out.

In yet another statement, he said he saw Konanki walking along the shore before he fell asleep.

What Sudiksha Konanki's father said?



Indian-origin Sudiksha Konanki , a 20-year-old pre-med student from Chantilly, Virginia was last seen while on spring break with five friends at the Riu Republic Resort in Punta Cana on March 6.Authorities in Virginia have identified Iowa resident Joshua Riibe as a ""person of interest"" in the case of University of Pittsburgh student who mysteriously vanished in the Dominican Republic.Authorities suspect the pre-med student may have drowned after entering the ocean wearing a brown bikini. Some reports indicate that she left her clothes on a chaise lounge before heading into the water.According to the New York Post, Subbarayudu Konanki, her father, submitted a complaint on Monday requesting broader search operations due to his increasing concern that his daughter might have been kidnapped, as her body was not found along the shore.""She’s not found, so we’re asking them to investigate multiple options, like kidnapping or abduction,"" he told WTOP-TV.The authorities maintained that there were no indications of criminal activity at the location. The complaint further added that Konanki's possessions, including her mobile phone and wallet, remained with her companions, which was considered unusual as she consistently kept her phone with her.Punta Cana authorities on Tuesday said that they are conducting fresh interviews with Konaki's five travelling companions, resort staff and others who were present with her during the early hours at the resort.","Sudiksha Konanki, 20, was last seen on March 6 at the Riu Republic Resort in Punta Cana.

MEERUT : Farmer Gurdeep Singh , 103, had to spend 19 months behind bars after his two sons orchestrated their father's incarceration to prevent him from executing his plan to donate five acres of land to a gurdwara , against their wishes.Singh's family was embroiled in a 2018 attempt to murder case following a quarrel with his brother's family. Singh and his family members were arrested but they soon came out on bail, and the trial went on.In 2022, the sons- Kamaljeet Singh and Harpreet Singh -plotted to send their father to jail and told him that the case was settled and that there was no need for him to go to court, while they attended the hearings. After no-show in several court hearings, a non-bailable warrant (NBW) was issued against Gurdeep Singh, following which he was arrested and jailed in Aug 2022.But luck soon smiled on him. Singh was released from Shahjahanpur Jail on Tuesday after spending over 19 months behind bars. Jail superintendent Mijaji Lal told TOI that Singh approached him in Nov last year, complaining about the lack of basic necessities, including clothes, shoes, sweater and turban cloth, as winter approached. Singh also mentioned that no one visited him in jail.Jail authorities then reached out to NGO Sahyog Sanstha for assistance. Within 15 days, the NGO helped Singh secure bail and arranged a guarantor for his release in Dec 2022.As the news of Singh's impending bail reached his sons' ears, they became anxious as they feared their father would give away the land once he came out of jail. They then gave an application opposing the bail, insisting only they could act as guarantors. But they never showed up, causing a delay of three more months before Singh was finally released after court's intervention.Speaking to TOI, Shahnawaz Khan, patron for the NGO and advocate representing Singh, said, ""When we took up his case last year, we found that his incarceration was based on a minor fault of not attending the court hearings in a case he was accused of. He could have gotten bail but no one pursued it on his behalf. Now, he is free and is under the care of Sahyog Sanstha.""","Farmer Gurdeep Singh, 103, had to spend 19 months behind bars after his two sons orchestrated their father's incarceration.

Pakistan train attack: Why is there an increase in attacks in Balochistan?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-train-attack-why-is-there-an-increase-in-attacks-in-balochistan/articleshow/118956939.cms,"AP photo.

Rebels warn of 'severe consequences.'

Suicide bombers were placed with hostages: Lt Gen

Pakistan's under-developed southwestern province of Balochistan has experienced prolonged insurgency, with increased attacks in recent years. On Tuesday, the outlawed Baluch Liberation Army (BLA) captured a passenger train, marking an unprecedented large-scale operation by the militant organisation.The militants held hundreds of passengers aboard the Jafer Express captive. Pakistani forces reported on Wednesday that they had eliminated all 50 attackers. According to military statements, the assailants killed 21 passengers, while the remaining passengers were safely rescued.Balochistan, Pakistan's largest yet least populated province, is home to the ethnic Baloch minority, who claim governmental discrimination. The separatists have been campaigning since the early 2000s for self-governance or independence from Islamabad, demanding a larger portion of the province's abundant natural resources.The BLA has drawn comparisons with Pakistani Taliban due to their threat level. The group regularly confronts Pakistani security forces and has previously targeted civilians, including Chinese nationals working on China-Pakistan Economic Corridor projects.Despite governmental claims of reduced violence, attacks persist in Balochistan, where Islamic militant groups also operate. The BLA, designated as a terrorist organisation by Pakistan and the United States, has approximately 3,000 fighters and aims to establish an independent Baloch state across regions in Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan.Pakistan alleges Indian support for the BLA and suggests collaboration between the group and the Pakistani Taliban. Analysts note increased BLA activity since the Pakistani Taliban terminated their cease-fire in November 2022.The porous 900-kilometre border with Iran contributes to regional instability, allowing unrestricted movement of smugglers and militant groups. Both nations accuse each other of harbouring insurgents.Economic implications are significant, deterring investment in Pakistan. The Belt and Road Initiative's investments have further alienated the Baloch community, who claim exploitation of local resources without community benefits.Security analyst Syed Muhammad Ali suggests that whilst the train attack garnered media attention, civilian casualties may diminish the BLA's local support.","Baluch Liberation Army (BLA) captured a passenger train on Tuesday.

Trump JOKES about JD VANCE'S SOCKS during speech: ‘I'M TRYING TO STAY FOCUSED!'

US President Donald Trump hosted Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin at the White House on Wednesday for the annual St Patrick's Day celebration , but the conversation in the Oval Office quickly diverged off course to Vice President JD Vance 's socks.As reporters gathered for the meeting, Trump began addressing inflation before abruptly shifting focus to Vance’s shamrock-themed footwear.""I have to just speak of inflation,"" Trump started, before trailing off and pointing at the VP Vance's feet.Making light of the moment, he bantered, ""I love these socks. What's with these socks!""—prompting laughter throughout the room. ""I'm trying to stay focused,"" he added.Vance, amused by the attention, chuckled as Trump continued admiring his choice of accessories.Vance’s white socks, decorated with green shamrocks, were a festive nod to the holiday. However, due to his liking for cropped pants that rise up when he sits, they became an unexpected centrepiece of the meeting.Shamrock is a type of clover, which holds symbolical significance for Ireland. It is also often associated with St Patrick's Day.According to Daily Beast, the vice president’s fashion choices have previously drawn attention online. Last month, social media users mocked his high-riding trousers, with one X user joking, ""JD Vance is such a Constitutionalist that he wears 1700s britches and stockings.""Menswear expert Derek Guy even weighed in, advising, ""The second lady should advise him to get wider pants and over-the-calf socks so that his bare leg doesn’t show when he sits down.""Despite the sartorial criticism, Vance has remained committed to his signature style—and this time, it won him the president’s undivided attention.Trump, however, never circled back to the topic of inflation after being side-tracked by Vance’s socks.","US President Donald Trump hosted Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin at the White House on Wednesday for the annual St Patrick's Day celebration.

Robert Morris , who established a major religious institution in Texas and previously advised the Trump administration on faith matters, faced child sexual abuse charges on Wednesday, according to Oklahoma's attorney general's office.Morris, aged 63, stepped down from his position as senior pastor of the Dallas-based Gateway Church last summer, following Cindy Clemishire public accusations of abuse during the 1980s, when she was a child.A grand jury issued five felony indictments against Morris for inappropriate acts towards a child, determining that he had inappropriately touched the victim's intimate areas between the ages of 12 and 14. The legal documents identify the victim only by the initials C.C.The victim, now 55 and residing in Oklahoma, disclosed to The Dallas Morning News that the abuse commenced when her family offered hospitality to Morris, then a travelling preacher, at their Oklahoma residence on Christmas Day in 1982. She explained that it took years before she recognised the events as criminal abuse.She said on Wednesday, ""After almost 43 years, the law has finally caught up with Robert Morris for the horrific crimes he committed against me."" She continued, ""My family and I are deeply grateful to the authorities who have worked tirelessly to make this day possible and remain hopeful that justice will ultimately prevail.""Meanwhile, Morris acknowledged to The Christian Post last year that he had engaged in ""inappropriate sexual behaviour with a young lady."" His church, Gateway Church, founded in 2000, reported over 100,000 attendees, making it amongst America's largest congregations.Gateway Church elder Tra Willbanks had addressed the allegations in November, stating, ""What happened to Cindy Clemishire was heartbreaking and vile, and we denounce sexual abuse in all of its forms."" He praised Clemishire's courage, noting that ""she has impacted countless lives.""During Trump's first presidential term, Morris served on a faith advisory council and hosted Trump at Gateway Church in June 2020.

KOLKATA: A fortnight after a mother and daughter were caught at Kumartuli trying to dispose of a relative’s body stuffed in a trolley bag, police on Tuesday nabbed two men who were on their way to dump the body of their business partner, also stuffed in a trolley bag, in a pond on the northern fringes of the city.Their plan was thwarted by an alert cab driver, Rahul Adhikari, who not only dialling 100 but pounced on them and stopped one from fleeing. Police recovered the body of Rajasthan-based Burrabazar businessman Bhaguram Dewasi from the trolley bag in the trunk of the app cab on Kalyani Expressway at Sodepur-Ghola. The accused, Krishna Pal Singh and Karan Singh, both in their early 30s, were arrested.Police said cousins Krishna and Karan were also residents of Rajasthan’s Pali Gaon and were planning to dump the body in a pond at Ghola’s Mahispota. But cab driver Adhikari grew suspicious when they stopped on a deserted stretch and tried to take out the bag. Seeing them struggle with the bulky bag, Adhikari questioned them but was offered a bribe.“Realising something was amiss, the cab driver dialled 100 and alerted an approaching police patrol vehicle. As the duo attempted to flee, he also managed to catch Karan and hand him over to police. Krishna’s mobile location was tracked and he was arrested within hours,” said a police officer said.The body was found with its throat slit, face, throat and hands tightly taped to prevent blood from oozing out. Police also recovered Rs 65,000 in cash from the accused.“Initial investigation suggests the murder was prompted by a financial dispute. The accused and the victim were business partners in a garment trade and had been living in a rented flat at Girish Park for over four years. We suspect Krishna and Karan killed Dewasi over an outstanding debt of Rs 8 lakh,” the officer added.As per the probe, the accused duo called Dewasi to their Muktaram Babu Street residence and served him poisoned coffee, “Once he lost consciousness, they strangled him and slit his throat. His body was stuffed into a trolley bag and transported by taxi to Dum Dum’s Nagerbazar, from where the duo booked an app cab to Sodepur-Ghola, intending to dispose it in a deserted area,” an investigating officer said.Police said the room on Mukta Ram Babu Street, where the businessman was murdered, was rented by a person named Ramesh Prajapati, according to the house owner. Both Kolkata and Ghola police have also summoned this Ramesh Prajapati for questioning. Kolkata police visited the Ghola police station. However, a North 24-Parganas court did not immediately allow Kolkata police to take over the probe.Police said CCTV footage shows that the accused committed the murder the previous night and then worked at the shop the entire day. Around 7.30 pm on Tuesday, one of the accused set out with the body in a suitcase in a taxi and reached Nagerbazar auto stand. Around 9.30 pm, they boarded another cab to Nimta. They ended the trip near Nimta PS and then changed into a third app-cab where they were nabbed.Sujata Bairagi, a neighbour, recalled: “Sometimes we heard them arguing over petty issues, but nothing serious. On Tuesday evening, I saw one of them carrying a large plastic bag but assumed he was taking out garbage. We were shocked to learn about the murder the next morning.”""During interrogation, one of the accused confessed to the murder, citing the financial dispute as the motive. We are probing all possible angles,” said Indra Badan Jha, DCP (Central), Barrackpore Police Commissionerate, told TOI, appreciating the cabbie's presence of mind to crack the crime.","Krishna Pal Singh and Karan Singh, both in their early 30s, were arrested.

""He has become a Palestinian..."" Trump attacks Chuck Schumer, says “not Jewish anymore”

Trump's 'Gaza takeover proposal'

Amid controversy over previously suggested 'Gaza takeover', US President Donald Trump clarified that no residents would be ""expelled"" from the region.The statement was delivered at a press conference from the Oval Office, before his discussion with Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin at the White House on Wednesday (local time).Sitting alongside Martin, Trump declared, ""No one is expelling anyone from Gaza,"" when questioned by a reporter about the ""president's plan"" for the war-torn region.Meanwhile, Martin emphasised the necessity of enhancing aid to Gaza whilst advocating for both a ceasefire and the liberation of hostages in Hamas custody since the October 7, 2023 attacks on Israel. This comes after, Israel's diplomatic relations with Ireland faced a setback when it declared the shuttering of its embassy in Ireland during December, attributing the decision to Ireland's stance against Israel. The action followed Ireland's backing of South Africa's legal proceedings against Israel at the International Court of Justice, where allegations of genocide were raised.In a separate development during the meeting, Trump referred to US Senate's minority leader Chuck Schumer as ""a Palestinian"". He said, ""Schumer is a Palestinian as far as I'm concerned. He's become a Palestinian. He used to be Jewish. He's not Jewish anymore. He's a Palestinian."" A comparable comment about Schumer appeared on his Truth Social platform in February.Last month, Trump put forward a proposal suggesting that the United States should assume control and ownership of the Gaza Strip. His vision included rebuilding the region entirely and converting it into a centre of economic activity.During a joint media briefing with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , Trump said, ""The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it. We'll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site and getting rid of the destroyed buildings. Create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for the people of the area.""Later, In a post on Truth Social, Trump echoed the sentiment saying, “The Gaza Strip would be turned over to the United States by Israel at the conclusion of fighting. The Palestinians, people like Chuck Schumer, would have already been resettled in far safer and more beautiful communities, with new and modern homes, in the region. They would actually have a chance to be happy, safe, and free. The US, working with great development teams from all over the World, would slowly and carefully begin the construction of what would become one of the greatest and most spectacular developments of its kind on Earth. No soldiers by the US would be needed! Stability for the region would reign!!!”","US President Donald Trump said that no residents would be ""expelled"" from Gaza.

Columbia University- A 'centre' for campus protests in US

Following the arrest of a prominent Palestinian campus activist Mahmoud Khalil by immigration officials , Columbia University 's administrators convened students and faculty from the journalism school to deliver a cautionary message.Stuart Karle, a First Amendment lawyer and adjunct professor, advised non-US citizen students to refrain from publishing content about the Gaza Strip, Ukraine and protests related to their former classmate's arrest. With graduation approaching, their academic achievements and personal liberty could face jeopardy under the Trump administration 's scrutiny, warned Karle. ""If you have a social media page, make sure it is not filled with commentary on the Middle East,"" he said, addressing the assembly in Pulitzer Hall.When a Palestinian student raised objections, Jelani Cobb, the journalism school's dean, spoke frankly about the institution's limitations in protecting international students from federal action. ""Nobody can protect you,"" Cobb said. ""These are dangerous times.""Additionally, in an interview Wednesday, quoted by the NYT, Cobb said he and his colleagues were trying to make it clear to their students at the town hall that they were in a moment of great risk. ""We were giving a brutally honest rendering of what the landscape is right now,"" he said.Columbia University has struggled to maintain equilibrium between free expression and student safety during two academic years of student protests against the Gaza war.The situation intensified last week when the Trump administration withdrew $400 million in federal grants and contracts, citing the university's alleged failure to address antisemitism. Columbia's interim president indicated this would affect ""nearly every corner of the university.""The following day, immigration authorities arrested recent graduate Khalil and removed him from university accommodation. President Donald Trump announced the revocation of Khalil's green card and impending deportation.Situated near major media outlets, Columbia emerged as the focal point of nationwide student protests last year. Their demonstrations sparked comparable protests at universities throughout the United States.Students supporting Palestinian liberation set up a camp at the university's centre in April, protesting the Gaza war and calling for the university to withdraw from ""all economic and academic stakes in Israel,"" including their joint programme with Tel Aviv University.Whilst most protests at Columbia remained non-violent, the growing encampment and student passion led some faculty and students to perceive the distinction between anti-Zionism and antisemitism becoming increasingly unclear.Jewish students reported feeling unsafe on campus due to encampment displays supporting the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. Specific antisemitism claims arose, including a controversial incident where a student protest leader stated, ""Zionists don't deserve to live."" (He was later suspended.)The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has historically created tension at Columbia. The university features significant student groups supporting both sides, a prominent Middle Eastern studies programme, and maintains a dual degree arrangement with Tel Aviv University.Columbia's legacy includes notable student activism since the 1960s and was home to Edward Said, the distinguished literary scholar and Palestinian advocate who authored ""Orientalism"".In the early 2000s, the university faced controversy over claims that pro-Palestinian academics had intimidated pro-Israel students. However, an academic panel investigation found no antisemitism evidence.Meanwhile, the present situation exceeds previous disagreements in scale. The Department of Education recently issued notices to 60 universities under investigation for breaching federal protections against ""antisemitic discrimination and harassment"".These institutions, ranging from Harvard University to the University of Tennessee, face ""potential enforcement actions"". However, Columbia faces unprecedented scrutiny and risks losing substantial federal funding over antisemitism allegations.","Columbia University has struggled to maintain equilibrium between free expression and student safety during two academic years of student protests.

By signalling its openness to a ceasefire, Ukraine has handed the Kremlin a difficult challenge at a time when the Russian military has the upper hand in the war: Should Moscow accept a truce and abandon hopes of making new gains, or should it reject the offer and risk derailing a cautious rapprochement with Washington?President Putin has repeatedly ruled out a temporary break in hostilities, saying it would only benefit Ukraine and its Western allies by letting them replenish their arsenals. He has insisted Moscow wants a comprehensive agreement that would ensure a lasting settlement.The Kremlin responded cautiously to the news of Ukraine accepting the US-proposed truce during Tuesday’s talks in Saudi Arabia, saying that it needs to know details of the discussions before expressing its view.The careful approach reflects Putin’s awareness of the risk that a blunt rejection of the offer could upset tentative efforts to normalise Russia-US relationship .Observers say that instead of an outright rejection, Putin will likely propose linking the truce to certain conditions that would protect Moscow’s interests. The Russian military held the battlefield initiative last year, making slow but steady gains along several sections of the 1,000km frontline.The US, meanwhile, res tarted supplies after Ukraine agreed to the truce proposal at talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. Secretary of state Marco Rubio said the United States was now seeking Moscow's full agreement to the proposal, without attaching any of its own demands. “That’s what we want to know — if they’re prepared to do it unconditionally,” Rubio said.President Donald Trump said he hopes Putin will agree to the US proposal . “I hope he’s going to have a ceasefire,” Trump told reporters at the White House.Earlier, Russian news agencies reported that the heads of the CIA and Russia's SVR foreign intelligence agency had held their first phone call in several years.","Kremlin responds cautiously to the news of Ukraine accepting the US-proposed truce during Tuesday’s talks in Saudi Arabia.

NUUK: A party that favours a gradual path to Greenland’s independence from Denmark won a surprise victory in parliamentary polls , held in the shadow of US President Donald Trump’s stated goal of taking control of the island one way or another.The centre-right Demokraatit Party has pushed back against Trump’s rhetoric, saying it is for Greenlanders to decide the future of the strategically important territory, which holds large reserves of rare earth minerals needed to make everything from mobile phones to renewable energy technology. The Arctic island is also home to a US air base and straddles strategic routes in the North Atlantic.The result should send clear message to Trump — Denmark is not for sale, said Demokraatit leader JensFriederik Nielsen. “We don’t want to be Americans. No, we don’t want to be Danes. We want to be Greenlanders. And we want our own independence in the future. And we want to build our own country by ourselves, not with his hope.”Trump has been outspoken about his desire to control Greenland, telling the Congress he thought the US was going to get it “one way or other.”A break from Denmark wasn’t on the ballot, but it was on everyone’s mind. Greenland was colonised 300 years ago by Denmark, which exercises control over foreign and defence policy. The island of 56,000 people has been on a path toward in dependence since at least 2009, and the 31 lawmakers elected will shape the island’s future as it debates whether the time has come to declare independence. Four of the five main parties sought independence, but disagreed on when and how.Second-placed Naleraq is the most aggressively pro-independence, while Demokraatit favours a moderate pace of change. Broadcaster DR reported Nielsen said his party would reach out to all parties to negotiate Greenland’s future political course.","US President Donald Trump has said he wants to take control of Greenland.

Foul play?

Authorities in Virginia have named a 24-year-old Iowa man as a ""person of interest"" in the mysterious disappearance of Indian-origin, University of Pittsburgh student Sudiksha Konanki during her spring break trip to the Dominican Republic .The Loudoun County Sheriff ’s Office, based in Konanki’s hometown of Chantilly, revealed that Joshua Ribe , identified from surveillance footage, has been ""interviewed at length"" but has not been accused of any wrongdoing, as reported by NY Post. The office is collaborating with the FBI and Dominican authorities as the search for the missing 20-year-old continues.Konanki, a pre-med student, vanished on March 6 while vacationing with five friends at the Riu Republic Resort in Punta Cana. Surveillance footage obtained by Dominican media outlet Noticias SIN shows Konanki and Ribe walking toward the beach around 4.15 am with a group of friends. The footage also appears to show Konanki clinging to Ribe as they made their way to the shoreline.According to reports, most of the group eventually returned to the hotel, leaving Konanki alone on the beach with Ribe. Ribe, who was visiting the Dominican Republic from Iowa, reportedly gave authorities three conflicting accounts of the night’s events.In his initial statement, Ribe claimed he became ill from the rough surf and returned to shore after checking on Konanki. In a second version, he said he left the water due to stomach pain and last saw her in knee-deep surf before he passed out. In a third account, he told investigators he saw Konanki walking along the shoreline before he lost consciousness on the sand.Despite these inconsistencies, Dominican authorities have not classified Ribe as a suspect and stated he is cooperating with their investigation.Local police have suggested that Konanki may have drowned after entering the ocean, but her father, Subbarayudu Konanki, has urged authorities to expand their search efforts. He shared ""growing suspicion"" that his daughter may have been kidnapped, noting that no body has washed ashore.A private investigator with experience in missing case of another high school student Natalee Holloway (2005) case has volunteered his services to assist in locating missing University of Pittsburgh student Sudiksha Konanki, suspecting potential abduction.Speaking to NewsNation on Monday night, TJ Ward, who previously assisted the Holloway family during their daughter's disappearance in Aruba two decades ago, confirmed he had reached out to the Konanki family to aid in the search efforts in the Dominican Republic while sharing concerns about the nature of Sudiksha's disappearance.In his interview with Fox News, Ward dismissed the possibility of drowning, stating, ""I don't think that she drowned in the ocean,"" and added that ""drowning would be one of the last things I think of right now."" ""I totally believe that somebody knows something, where she is, or somebody took her away, or somebody's holding her somewhere.""As the speculations continue to swirl around the case, the Dominican Republic National Police are now re-interviewing Konanki’s travel companions, hotel staff, and others who were present during the early morning hours. A high-level commission involving both US and Dominican agencies, including the FBI, is leading the investigation.As the search enters its fifth day, authorities are distributing missing person posters describing Konanki as 5-foot-3 with black hair and brown eyes.

Errol Musk on having child with Elon: 'Any woman with a slight brain would be mad to say no',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/errol-musk-on-having-child-with-elon-any-woman-with-slight-brain-would-be-mad-to-say-no-ashley-st-clair/articleshow/118807869.cms,"Errol on St. Clair: ‘A little crazy’ or the opportunity of a lifetime?

No clarifications, just more speculation

Errol’s contradictions: Defending Elon while taking shots at his exes

Errol Musk , never one to hold back, has weighed in on the swirling controversy surrounding Ashley St. Clair’s claim that she secretly gave birth to Elon Musk ’s 13th child. While making it abundantly clear that he has no insider knowledge, Errol still had plenty to say—dropping his usual mix of blunt opinions and offbeat musings.Sitting in his sprawling South African home, surrounded by chaotic domesticity, Errol made no effort to soften his words about the 26-year-old right-wing influencer. “I would find it very strange if a woman is saying she has had a child with Elon and telling people quite publicly about it,” he said during an interview with the Daily Mail. “If it turns out not to be true, she would be a little crazy, don’t you think?”But in the next breath, his tone shifted. “Any woman with a slight brain would be mad to turn down the opportunity if she were to be offered a child with Elon,” he said as quoted by the Daily Mail, an eyebrow-raising remark that seemed both a backhanded compliment and a subtle dig at St. Clair’s credibility.Despite his sharp words, Errol refused to take a definitive stance on whether St. Clair was telling the truth. When pressed, he simply let his earlier statements hang in the air, leaving the speculation to simmer.His comments stand in contrast to his past critiques of Elon as a father. Just weeks ago, Errol publicly accused his billionaire son of being a neglectful parent, particularly in the wake of the tragic loss of Elon’s first child, Nevada, in 2002. But in this latest conversation, his tone seemed more conciliatory.Though Errol has often been openly critical of Elon, he appears to have drawn the line at St. Clair’s allegations. In fact, his words hinted at an uncharacteristic moment of defense for his son. “I think Elon is a good father. He is trying to be,” he said. “No one sets out to be a bad father. It’s very difficult.”Yet, true to form, his defenses often come with a sting. When the subject turned to Elon’s other exes—particularly Grimes—Errol was less forgiving. “She is nice, an attractive girl in some ways... She is a little nuts,” he quipped, before attributing the couple’s children’s “very weird” names solely to the musician. “It’s not Elon’s work. He was trying to make her happy.”","Errol Musk has weighed in on the controversy surrounding Ashley St. Clair’s claim that she secretly gave birth to Elon Musk ’s 13th child. “I would find it very strange if a woman is saying she has had a child with Elon and telling people quite publicly about it,” he said.

Winter Storm to hit California, Forecast latest | California Weather

California’s short break from winter weather has come to an end as the first in a series of storms brought rain to Southern California on Tuesday. A second, more intense storm is expected to impact the entire state between Wednesday and Thursday, delivering widespread rain and snow.The second storm was set to arrive in Northern California on Tuesday night before spreading into Central and Southern California by Wednesday. Rain is expected to drench coastal and urban areas, while higher elevations could see significant snowfall. Meteorologists predict several feet of snow in the Sierra Nevada, which may cause travel delays.""This is a widespread system that's going to affect much of the state, which has not been the case with many storms this year,"" said Brian Hurley, a meteorologist with the Weather Prediction Center .With heavy rain expected, forecasters warn of potential urban flooding and landslides, especially in areas recently affected by wildfires. In Los Angeles County, Malibu has already issued evacuation warnings as a precaution.""There's a pretty good chance of there being some issues in the burn scars, especially where the Palisades and Eaton fires burned,"" said Rose Schoenfeld, a forecaster with the National Weather Service.This storm is expected to be one of the last major precipitation events of the season. While storms have delivered a strong snowpack to Northern California, the southern Sierra region has seen below-average snowfall. Any additional snow from this storm could help replenish the state's water supply.""In the last couple of years, we've had storms in April, but they tend to be less frequent,"" Hurley said.The storm is expected to exit California by Thursday, but lingering moisture could bring scattered rain and snow through the weekend, particularly in far Northern California.","First in a series of storms brought rain to Southern California on Tuesday.

USAID employees told to burn, shred and destroy classified documents

Erica Carr , the acting executive secretary of USAID , who ordered the mass shredding and burning of paper files at the agency, is allegedly a Biden-era appointee.Former State Department official Mike Benz took to X (formerly Twitter) to highlight that Carr was appointed by President Biden in his first week in office.Expressing shock, he wrote,So the current Acting Executive Secretary of USAID who ordered the mass shredding and burning of paper files at USAID today worked in the Obama OPM, then Obama USAID, then was personally named USAID Executive Secretary by Joe Biden his first week in office.

ISLAMABAD: Global rights organisation Amnesty International called on Pakistan Tuesday to free and drop all charges against minority Ahmadis jailed in recent weeks and ensure adequate protection of their places of worship.In the last two weeks alone, more than 60 Ahmadis, including children, have been detained and their places of worship vandalised in Punjab and Sindh provinces. Police have filed cases against them under section 298-C of Pakistan Penal Code, which bars the community from calling themselves Muslims or preaching their faith.“The disturbing pattern of arbitrary arrests , harassment and violence against Ahmadi community is in violation of their right to freedom of religion and belief. Local authorities in Pakistan must provide adequate protection to Ahmadi places of worship and officials engaged in harassment or destruction of Ahmadi property must be brought to justice,” Amnesty posted on X.In Pakistan, Ahmadis face significant and escalating threat from the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), a far-right Islamist political party known for its hardline stance on blasphemy and its targeting of religious minorities.TLP members have been linked to physical attacks on Ahmadis, desecration of their graves, and demolition of their places of worship. Since the start of this month, TLP members have reportedly attacked 27 Ahmadis in Bahawalnagar, demolished a 120-year-old place of worship in Gujranwala and gathered outside worship sites in cities like Karachi, Sialkot and Jauharabad to prevent Ahmadis from praying, often with police either unable or unwilling to intervene effectively.On March 1, police arrested 22 Ahmadis in Daska region of Sialkot for offering prayers in their religious place. On March 7, over two dozen members of the Ahmadi community, including children, were taken into “protective custody” by law enforcement personnel as a mob gathered outside its place of worship in Surjani, Karachi.Later that day, police registered a criminal case against over two dozen Ahmadi members and arrested six of them on a TLP activist’s complaint in Surjani.The previous day, police booked nine people, two of them Ahmadis, on charges of torturing a TLP activist to death during a scuffle in Bahawalnagar. However, intelligence and police sources suggest the TLP activist’s death was not a result of a fight with Ahmadis. They said the seven people who faced charges of killing a TLP worker were members of Ahle Sunnat Wal Jamaat (ASWJ). There had been a confrontation between ASWJ activists and TLP members a couple of days back.","In the last two weeks, more than 60 Ahmadis, including children, have been detained and their places of worship vandalised in Punjab and Sindh provinces.

""The train was stopped by armed men in Tunnel No 8,"" the Controller Railways Muhammad Kashif said in a statement.The terrain, which has 17 tunnels, allowed the militants to take advantage of the slow-moving train.

Nepal’s former King Gyanendra Shah was greeted with the chants of ""come king, save the nation"" by thousands of his supporters as he arrived in Kathmandu on Sunday, amid growing calls for the reinstatement of the monarchy and Nepal’s status as a Hindu state.According to the news agency AFP, Shah’s supporters waved Nepal’s flag and chanted slogans like ""Come king, save the nation!"" as the 77-year-old former monarch stepped out of Tribhuvan International Airport following a tour of western Nepal.The crowd, which included members of the pro-monarchist Rastriya Prajatantra Party , carried placards reading ""We want our King back"" and ""Abolish federal republican system and reinstate the monarchy.""AP reported that an estimated 10,000 supporters gathered outside the airport, blocking its main entrance. Passengers were forced to walk to and from the airport due to the heavy crowd. Riot police were deployed to prevent demonstrators from entering the premises, but no violence was reported.Nepal abolished its 240-year-old monarchy in 2008 after a decade-long civil war that left over 16,000 dead. However, dissatisfaction with political instability, corruption and economic struggles has fuelled a resurgence of support for the former royal family.“The country faces instability, prices are high, people are jobless, and there is a lack of education and healthcare facilities,” said Rajindra Kunwar, a teacher who joined the rally who was quoted by AFP. “The poor are dying of hunger. The law applies to the public, but not to politicians. That’s why we need the king back”, Kunwar added.Nepal has had 13 different governments since 2008, with growing frustration over governance issues. Some protesters, including those who previously supported the abolition of the monarchy, have now changed their stance. “I was in the protests that took away monarchy, hoping it would help the country, but I was mistaken,” said Kulraj Shrestha, a carpenter. “The nation has further plunged, so I have changed my mind”, Shrestha added.Gyanendra, who has generally remained silent on political matters, has made several public appearances recently. On the eve of Nepal’s Democracy Day last month, he issued a statement saying, ""It is now time. If we wish to save our nation and maintain national unity, I call on all countrymen to support us for Nepal's prosperity and progress.""Despite the rising pro-monarchy sentiment, political analyst Lok Raj Baral told AFP that the monarchy's return is unlikely, stating that it was ""a source of instability."" He added, ""For some disgruntled groups, it has become a retreat due to the incompetence of politicians.""As per PTI, security was heightened in Kathmandu, with dozens of riot policemen deployed around Narayanhiti Palace Museum, the former royal residence. There were rumours that Gyanendra might attempt to enter the palace with his supporters but the former king proceeded to his private residence, Nirmal Niwas, without any incident.The movement for the monarchy’s restoration has been gaining traction since February, when Gyanendra’s Democracy Day statement reignited debate on Nepal’s future political system.Bollywood actress Manisha Koirala, who is the granddaughter of Nepal’s first elected Prime Minister BP Koirala, urged Nepalis on social media to gather at the airport to welcome the former monarch.","Nepal's former King Gyanendra Shah greeted with chants of ""come king, save the nation"" by thousands of his supporters as he arrived in Kathmandu on Sunday.

Can Gyanendra return to power?

Chants of ""Long live our beloved king"" and ""Vacate the royal palace for the king"" echoed through the streets of Kathmandu on Sunday as thousands of supporters of Nepal's former king, Gyanendra Shah , gathered to demand the restoration of the monarchy and Hinduism as the state religion.An estimated 10,000 royalists blocked the main entrance to Tribhuvan International Airport as Gyanendra returned from a tour of western Nepal. Protesters waved flags and carried banners calling for the former king’s reinstatement. The demonstration disrupted airport operations, forcing passengers to walk to and from the terminal, while hundreds of riot police prevented demonstrators from entering the airport. Despite the intensity of the protest, no violence was reported.Nepal abolished its 239-year-old monarchy in 2008, two years after massive street protests forced Gyanendra to step down from absolute rule. The country became a federal democratic republic, but since then, many Nepalis have grown frustrated with political instability and economic struggles.Since the abolition of the monarchy, Nepal has seen 13 different governments, leading many to believe the current system has failed. Corruption, economic hardship, and lack of political stability have left some citizens reconsidering their stance on monarchy.""We are here to give the king our full support and to rally behind him all the way to reinstating him in the royal throne,"" said Thir Bahadur Bhandari, a 72-year-old protester.Kulraj Shrestha, a 50-year-old carpenter, admitted he had initially opposed the monarchy but had since changed his mind. ""I was in the protests that took away monarchy, hoping it would help the country, but I was mistaken. The nation has further plunged, so I have changed my mind,"" he said.Despite the growing support, Gyanendra has not commented on the renewed calls for his return. Political analysts believe his chances of regaining the throne remain slim in the near future. The republic is constitutionally enshrined, and mainstream political parties remain opposed to reinstating the monarchy.Gyanendra, who first became king in 2002 after the tragic massacre of his brother King Birendra and his family, initially ruled as a constitutional monarch. However, in 2005, he seized absolute power, dissolving the government and parliament, jailing politicians and journalists, and imposing emergency rule. His authoritarian rule led to the mass protests that ultimately resulted in the abolition of the monarchy.","Nepal abolished its 239-year-old monarchy in 2008, two years after massive street protests forced Gyanendra to step down from absolute rule.

Ongoing global criticism



International pressure and Taliban's isolation



On International Women's Day, the Taliban issued a statement asserting their commitment to safeguarding the rights of Afghan women.Chief spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid posted on his official X account, stating that the ''Islamic Emirate assumes full responsibility for the provision and safeguarding of the rights of Afghan women.''Without directly referencing International Women's Day, Mujahid said that dignity, honor, and legal rights for women remain a priority for the Taliban government.He claimed that Afghan women ''live in security, both physically and psychologically''and that their ''fundamental rights'' — such as autonomy in marital decisions, dowry entitlements, and inheritance — are protected.The Taliban's statement comes as the United Nations continues to denounce the severe restrictions on Afghan women.Since seizing control in 2021, the Taliban have imposed sweeping bans on education and employment for women. Girls were barred from secondary education, and later, from attending and teaching at Kabul University.In August 2023, the Vice and Virtue Ministry expanded restrictions, prohibiting women's voices in public and mandating full face coverings outside the home.On Saturday, the UN renewed its call for these bans to be lifted. ''The erasure of women and girls from public life cannot be ignored,'' said Roza Otunbayeva, head of the UN mission in Afghanistan.Alison Davidian, special representative for UN Women Afghanistan, added, ""We must stand with Afghan women as if our own lives depend on it — because they do.""Mujahid emphasized distinctions in Afghan and Western notions of women's rights. He said ''Afghan women's rights are situated within the specific context of an Islamic and Afghan society, which exhibits distinct divergences from Western societies and their cultural paradigms.''The Taliban remain globally isolated, with no official recognition as running Afghanistan's government due to their policies on women. In January, the International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor requested arrest warrants for two senior Taliban officials for their role in repressing Afghan women.Last Friday, Unesco hosted a high-level conference on women and girls in Afghanistan, featuring activists, parliamentarians, and rights experts. They included Hamida Aman, founder of the women-only station Radio Begum, former Afghan lawmaker Fawzia Koofi and human rights expert Richard Bennett, who has been barred from entering Afghanistan.In response, Saif ul-Islam Khyber, a spokesman for the Vice and Virtue Ministry, dismissed such gatherings, calling them an ''exposure of the hypocrisy of certain organizations and European Union foundations.''","The Taliban issued a statement asserting their commitment to safeguarding the rights of Afghan women.

DHAKA: Chief adviser Muhammad Yunus voiced strong concern over recent reports of attacks on women, calling them ""deeply troubling"" and a clear deviation from the vision of a ""New Bangladesh"" that the nation's people strive for.His comment, made at an International Women's Day event, came in the aftermath of the harrowing plight of an eight-year-old girl who is fighting for her life after being allegedly raped. This case is not an isolated incident but part of a broader, grim trend of sexual violence that has plagued the country. Reports of rape, gang rape, sexual assault and harassment have become disturbingly frequent.Addressing the situation of violence against women in Bangladesh that remained troubling since last year, with shocking numbers reported in the first two months, Fauzia Moslem, president of Bangladesh Mahila Parishad, said, ""Society is descending into chaos, where lawlessness and criminal impunity are growing. The failure of law enforcement, compromises, and lack of accountability are empowering criminals.""A report by the Manabadhikar Shongskriti Foundation (MSF) in Dhaka revealed that Feb 2025 documented 295 incidents of violence against women and children, 24 more than in Jan. It noted that Islamic fundamentalist groups, terrorists, and other extremist elements play a visible role in these incidents.A total of 21 women from various professions told local media that they experienced sexual harassment outside the home in past three months. The women, aged between 19 and 48 and residing in Dhaka, reported multiple instances.According to Dhaka-based human rights organisation Ain o Salish Kendra, in Feb, 46 women were victims of rape, 22 of whom were under 18. In Jan, this number was 39, including 15 minors.(With inputs from ANI)","Chief adviser Muhammad Yunus voiced strong concern over recent reports of attacks on women.

The organisation was termed as a ""terrorist organisation"" by India for trying to ""establish Islamic state and caliphate globally"".The ""March for Khilafat"" was joined by the thousands and the rally began from the north gate of Baitul Mukarram National Mosque in the capital city. The clashes erupted when the police intervened to stop the march, Dhaka Tribune reported.The procession initially proceeded without disruption, but tensions flared as demonstrators moved from Paltan towards Bijoynagar, where police set up a blockade. In response, Hizb ut-Tahrir members resisted, triggering a chase between both sides.To disperse the crowd, police fired tear gas shells and sound grenades, temporarily scattering the demonstrators. However, they later regrouped and attempted to resume their procession. As tensions escalated, law enforcement once again deployed tear gas, while protesters retaliated by hurling bricks and stones at officers. The confrontation intensified, resulting in the arrest of several Hizb ut-Tahrir members, Dhaka Tribune reported.The group remains a banned organization in Bangladesh, with all its activities and demonstrations declared illegal.The march comes amid rising concerns of violence against minorities and recent attacks on cultural, religious, and diplomatic properties in the south Asian nation, as raised by India at several occasions, especially after the ouster of former Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina last year.This was reiterated by a UN report released in January which revealed that members of Bangladesh's Hindu, Ahmadiyya Muslim, and indigenous communities faced human rights abuses during the anti-discrimination protests that led to the fall of Sheikh Hasina's government in 204 and its aftermath.It said that even though authorities had reportedly made 100 arrests in connection with the attacks, many perpetrators of revenge violence and targeted assaults continued to enjoy impunity.India declared Hizb ut-Tahrir a terrorist organisation last year and said that the group was ""involved in various acts of terror, including radicalising the gullible youths to join terrorist organisations and raise funds for terror activities, posing a serious threat to the national security and sovereignty of India. The Modi government is committed to securing Bharat by dealing the forces of terror with an iron fist.”“HuT is an organisation which aims to establish Islamic state and caliphate globally, including in India, by overthrowing democratically elected governments through jihad and terrorist activities by involving citizens of the country, which is a grave threat to the democratic setup and internal security of the country,” the ministry of home affairs had said.","Hizb ut-Tahrir held its first open rally in Dhaka on Friday against Bangladeshi administration's orders.

Nature rich coastline

Economic impact

GRIMSBY: Locals in the faded fishing town of Grimsby voiced fears for their livelihoods and the rich seaside environment Tuesday, a day after a cargo ship struck a tanker off England's northeast coast.There was shock Tuesday in the port town of Grimsby a day after a cargo ship struck a tanker off England's northeast coast with fears the accident could impact livelihoods and the environment.Some 13 miles (20 kilometres) out to sea, AFP images showed the Solong cargo ship, which on Monday hit the jet fuel-laden Stena Immaculate tanker , triggering a huge blaze, was little more than a smoking wreck.The still-anchored Stena Immaculate tanker was seen still anchored in the North Sea with a gaping gash to its side.In Grimsby, once the home of the world's largest fishing fleet, the port area where rescued sailors from the two ships were taken remained cordoned off.Twenty-four hours earlier the sound of helicopters and ambulances had filled the air as all but one of the crew members made it ashore.Townspeople steeped in the area's fishing and seafaring history expressed astonishment that such an accident could happen in broad daylight despite modern navigation equipment.The Stena Immaculate tanker carrying 220,000 barrels of jet fuel had been at anchor when the container ship Solong hurtled into it Monday morning.""(I was) very surprised,"" Raymond Todd, 71, told AFP at a local cafe, because modern equipment meant such accidents ""should not happen"".The retired fisherman, who went to sea at the age of 15 and spent his working life fishing waters around Iceland, Norway and Greenland, speculated that a ""mechanical failure with the radar or something"" might have been the cause.Otherwise, he said, ""I would think that (they) never had anybody manning the radar.""""Obviously it's thick fog out there, so they should have had extra lookouts on the bridge and if it was doing 16 knots, which I imagine is full speed why did they go so fast? In a busy shipping lane,"" he said.Todd said he feared any oil spill or release of toxic products from the ships could ""wreck"" the livelihoods of those fishermen who still ""actually go out there to earn a living"".Humberside police said Tuesday that a 59-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter following the accident.In the mid-20th century, Grimsby was one of the world's leading fishing ports but the fleets of trawlers began to disappear in the 1970s.Fishermen blamed the "" cod war "" over fishing grounds with Iceland, then EU quotas carved up the seas around Europe, reducing the catch of British boats.Locals also expressed fears for the region's bird and nature-rich coastline.Transport minister Mike Kane told parliament there was currently ""no sign of pollution"".But Andrew Vear, 54, said his wife, who works for a bird conservation group, was ""really concerned"", as he cleaned windows at a local pub.Vear said he too was worried about puffins and seals which have well-established colonies around the Humber estuary.Helen Dawson, 84, was more optimistic about the impact on the coastline. ""They'll get it cleared up somehow,"" she said.But she cautioned that if the fish were affected it would have an impact not just on local fishermen, but also local restaurants and others involved in the town's economy.""This is a fishing town, we're known for that,"" added massage therapist Amy Wilson, 34.She said she was upset about the ""human losses"" -- one missing crew member is presumed dead -- as well as ""the lasting impact on the environment"".For her, the accident was ""definitely another kick in the teeth"" for the region which has seen a decline in its economic fortunes over recent decades.Nearly a decade ago, some 70 per cent of people in the town voted for Brexit, hoping the UK's departure from the European Union would boost its flagging fortunes.But Wilson said there was little sign of any economic boost.""We keep getting promised improvements... It just isn't happening,"" she said.","Locals in the faded fishing town of Grimsby voiced fears for their livelihoods and the rich seaside environment Tuesday.

'Where are the life vests?':Meghan Markle under fire after fans spot daughter Lilibet without safety gear in boat photo,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/where-are-the-life-vestsmeghan-markle-under-fire-after-fans-notice-daughter-lilibet-without-safety-gear-in-rare-boat-photo/articleshow/118823204.cms,"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are under fire after Meghan Markle shared a rare photo of their daughter, Lilibet celebrating International Women’s Day. What was intended as a touching tribute quickly turned controversial, as critics accused the couple of being “irresponsible” for allowing their young daughter on a boat without a life vest.Meghan, 43, shared a photo on Instagram, showing her three-year-old daughter, Lilibet, curled up on her father Prince Harry’s lap as he gently kissed her head while they enjoyed a boat ride together.The social media post also featured more images celebrating inspiring women, including a charming selfie of Meghan with her mother, Doria Ragland, and a heartfelt snapshot of Meghan and Harry laughing and hugging on the beach.The caption read: ""Celebrating the strong women around us & the girls with dreams who will become women with vision. Also thanking those who uplift us every day.""However, numerous social media followers expressed concern regarding the absence of a safety vest on the three-year-old in the photograph.Users on X shared their opinions, with many criticising the former royal couple. Whilst some labelled it 'irresponsible', others highlighted its illegality. In California, where the couple lives with their two children, state law mandates that all children under 13 must wear a life jacket while aboard a moving vessel of any size.""Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are so good at showing the world how much they suck at being parents,"" stated one viral post on X.""Prince Harry & Meghan Markle never have the basic necessities for child safety which makes me question if they are parents. Where are the car seats? Where are the life vests? Do any children even live with them?"" another posted on X.One response noted, ""They're not even wearing seatbelts and life vests. Reckless.""""I've had boats my entire life. My children grew up to have their own boats. ALWAYS have a life jacket on your children,"" read another comment.""How irresponsible,' criticised one individual. 'Even pet owners put life vests on their pets when riding in boats.""A separate post stated: ""Meghan also had Archie on her lap without a seatbelt on herself or him in his car seat as legally required. The vehicle was going quite fast too.""","Meghan, 43, shared a photo of her daughter, Lilibet, on a boat with Prince Harry. The photo was meant to celebrate International Women's Day.

'It’s time to make Putin pay': Rishi Sunak urges seizing $300 billion in Russian assets to rebuild Ukraine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/its-time-to-make-putin-pay-rishi-sunak-urges-seizing-300-billion-in-russian-assets-to-rebuild-ukraine/articleshow/118818058.cms,"Rishi Sunak

Former British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has called on Western nations to seize $300 billion in frozen Russian state assets , insisting that Moscow must be held accountable for the devastation caused by its invasion of Ukraine, saying, “It’s time to make Putin pay.”He argued that Western taxpayers should not bear the burden of rebuilding a country that Russia has destroyed.“Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has caused $524 billion in destruction – devastating cities, industries, and lives,” Sunak said. “The world must ensure that Russia, not Western taxpayers, foots the bill for Ukraine’s recovery.”Seizing these assets, he said, would not only help rebuild Ukraine but also ease financial pressure on allied nations and send a clear message that aggression will not pay. While some claim confiscating Russian funds would violate international law, Sunak dismissed those concerns, citing legal pathways outlined by experts, including those at the Hoover Institution . He pointed out that the West already uses the interest from these assets to support Ukraine, arguing that if that is legal, so is using the capital itself. “The principle is clear: if you destroy another nation, you should pay for the damage,” he said.Addressing concerns that such a move could undermine trust in Western financial systems, Sunak argued that Russia had already attempted to move its reserves before invading Ukraine and that rogue states have few safe alternatives. He called on the European Union, which holds a significant portion of the frozen Russian assets, to take decisive action. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala have also voiced their support for seizing the funds according to Sunak. “Ukraine shouldn’t be left waiting while its cities remain in ruins,” Sunak said.Earlier this week, Sunak had also weighed in on the recent Oval Office meeting between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which reportedly turned tense over a mineral deal seen as key to continued US support. Trump and his Vice President, JD Vance, accused Zelenskyy of not showing enough gratitude, leading to a heated exchange. According to BBC, Sunak condemned Trump’s treatment of the Ukrainian leader, saying, “It was very hard to watch. For him to have been treated that way was wrong.”Reinforcing the urgency of his call, Sunak stressed that Ukraine’s future depends on decisive action. Seizing Russian assets, he said, would not only fund reconstruction but also strengthen Ukraine’s military, deterring future Russian aggression. “If we let Russia off the hook, we set a dangerous precedent for other aggressors. That’s why we must act,” he said.","Former British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has called on Western nations to seize $300 billion in frozen Russian state assets.

Opposition MP Bob Blackman raises Jaishankar 'attack' in UK Parliament,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/opposition-mp-bob-blackman-raises-jaishankar-attack-in-uk-parliament/articleshow/118766523.cms,"London, Britain's Opposition Conservative Party lawmaker Bob Blackman on Thursday raised the issue of the ""attack"" on External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar in London by "" Khalistani thugs "" in the House of Commons. During a Business of the House session, the Chair of the Backbench Business Committee described the security breach on Wednesday evening as an affront to democracy and called on Home Secretary Yvette Cooper to make a statement in Parliament on the issue of safety of Indian visitors to the UK.It came soon after the UK's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) had issued a statement strongly condemning the incident outside Chatham House in central London.""Yesterday, the External Affairs Minister from India, Shri Jaishankar, was attacked when he was leaving a public venue where he had been addressing an audience of Indian people in this country,"" said Blackman.""He was attacked by Khalistani thugs. That is against the Geneva Convention, and it appears that the police and the security forces failed to ensure that he was made safe. That is an affront to democracy, and an affront to our friends and allies in India,"" he said.""We need to make sure that does not happen again. Will the Leader of the House ensure that the Home Secretary or an appropriate minister makes a statement to the House about what protection we will have to ensure that visitors to this country are safe?"" he questioned.Lucy Powell, the Labour government's Leader of the House of Commons, expressed her shock at the incident and assured Blackman of a ""full response"" from the Home Secretary.""I am very sorry to hear about what sounded like a serious attack on a visitor to this country from the Indian Parliament. That is unacceptable and not the way in which we want our visitors to be treated,"" said Powell.Earlier, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) had called on the UK to ""live up to their diplomatic obligations"" after a protester attempted to breach the security perimeter as Jaishankar left the London venue after an in-conversation session on India's role in the world. It later also summoned UK Charge D' Affaires Christina Scott to register its serious concerns.The FCDO, meanwhile, said, ""any attempts to intimidate, threaten, or disrupt public events are completely unacceptable.""""The Metropolitan Police acted swiftly to address the situation, and we remain fully committed to ensuring the security of all our diplomatic visitors, in line with our international obligations,"" a spokesperson said.The Met Police stressed that the protester who ran in front of the minister's stationary car waving a flag was ""quickly intercepted by officers and moved out of the way"".""He did not get close to the minister who was able to leave the area without further incident. There were no arrests,"" a police spokesperson said.Jaishankar, who is on a tour of the UK and Ireland this week, is to hold bilateral talks with his Irish counterpart, Simon Harris, in Dublin on Thursday.","Opposition Conservative Party lawmaker Bob Blackman raised the issue of the ""attack"" on External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar in London by "" Khalistani thugs "" in the House of Commons.
