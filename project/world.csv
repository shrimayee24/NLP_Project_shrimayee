Cyclone Montha: Army, NDRF On Alert As Twin Cyclonic Systems Build Up In Arabian Sea & Bay Of Bengal

Odisha, TN to get rain





KAKINADA (ANDHRA PRADESH): Cyclonic storm Montha in Bay of Bengal was on Monday headed towards Andhra Pradesh, where it’s expected to cross the coast between Machilipatnam and Kalingapatnam after making a landfall near Kakinada around midnight on Tuesday before moving towards southern Odisha.The season’s first major storm, currently centred over west-central Bay of Bengal and moving northnorthwestward, is expected to intensify into a “severe cyclonic storm” before making landfall with wind speeds of 90-100 kilometres per hour and gusts up to 110 kmph.Andhra Pradesh govt has put the districts of Kakinada, Konaseema, West Godavari, Eluru and East Godavari on high alert. CM N Chandrababu Naidu has asked officials to prevent any cyclone-related deaths.Civil supplies minister Nadendla Manhor, the incharge minister for Eluru, who held a review meeting at Kakinada collectorate on Monday, said 269 rehabilitation centres have been set up with all facilities, while 30 NDRF and 50 SDRF teams have been pressed into service. Earthmovers, tractors and generators with enough fuel stocks have been kept ready.“Nearly 140 pregnant women from nearby villages have been shifted to hospitals.Essential goods and medicines have been kept ready, and holidays have been declared for all educational institutions till Wednesday. All fishing boats have been recalled from the sea,” he said.While Andhra Pradesh will bear the brunt of the storm, with red and orange alerts issued for 23 districts, the south-coastal districts of neighbouring Odisha are likely to witness heavy rainfall and strong winds.

Andhra Braces for Cyclone Montha Landfall; IMD Warns of Heavy Rain, Strong Winds

Sea turns violent in Kakinada, floods homes, tears up roads

KAIKNADA/BHUBANESWAR: Cyclone Montha roared ashore on the eastern coast Tuesday night, slamming into Andhra Pradesh between Machilipatnam and Kalingapatnam near Kakinada with winds topping 100km an hour and sheets of rain that ripped through towns, snapped power lines, and sent waves surging 10ft high.The season's first major cyclone made landfall as a severe storm around 7.30pm, its crossing lasting nearly 4 hours. Trees lay strewn across highways, power poles twisted in the wind, and rescue teams battled driving rain to clear the roads. A woman died in Makanapalem village of Mamidikuduru mandal when a tree crashed onto her home.Across the border in Odisha, Montha's outer bands brought torrential rain and winds up to 100kmph through Ganjam and Gajapati districts, blocking roads and toppling trees. No casualties were reported, but landslides cut off stretches of R Udayagiri, Parlakhemundi, Huma, and Kashipur.The sea turned violent at Uppada in Kakinada district, flooding homes and tearing up the coastal road. Police sealed the Kakinada-Uppada beach road after waves breached embankments. As the cyclone's eye passed inland, thousands huddled in shelters, waiting for the storm to pass. Over 10,000 Andhra residents, mostly fishing families, were evacuated from 65 villages in 12 coastal mandals before landfall.Kakinada district collector S Shan Mohan said two NDRF teams and one SDRF unit were in the field, backed by 200 swimmers and 140 boats. ""Helipads have been kept ready to airlift people from submerged areas as and when required,"" he said. More than 12,000 people took shelter in 76 cyclone relief centres. Nearly 1,000 heads of cattle were moved to safer ground.Eight flights were cancelled at Rajahmundry airport, disrupting connections to Tirupati, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Mumbai.In Odisha, state govt opened over 2,000 cyclone shelters and deployed 158 emergency teams - five NDRF, 30 ODRAF, and 123 fire service units - to lead rescue and relief work. CM Mohan Majhi reviewed operations and said that 11,000 vulnerable people had been moved to safety under the ""zero casualty"" mission. ""Another 30,000 could be evacuated if conditions worsen,"" he said.Deputy chief minister KV Singhdeo said crop damage was extensive and promised aid once district reports arrive within a week.IMD director general Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said Montha's impact would linger through Wednesday, bringing heavy to extremely heavy rainfall to southern Odisha before weakening over Chhattisgarh. Wind speeds could reach 80kmph as the system moves inland.Regional IMD chief Manorama Mohanty said rainfall will taper off by Friday, with lingering showers Thursday in interior Odisha.","The season's first major cyclone made landfall as a severe storm around 7.30pm, its crossing lasting nearly 4 hours.

SRINAGAR: J&K CM Omar Abdullah 's National Conference and BJP teamed up in the assembly for the first time Tuesday to vote out PDP 's proposed ""anti-bulldozer bill"" that seeks to grant ownership rights to locals occupying illegal properties on state-owned land for over 20 years.Omar, already facing allegations about last Friday's Rajya Sabha election being ""a fixed match"" after BJP won one of the four seats at stake, received a rare shout-out from the saffron party later for rejecting PDP's land bill ""in national interest"".""How can this bill be justified when it seeks to legitimise illegal constructions on state land?"" Omar said in the House before speaker Abdul Rahim Rather put the bill to vote. ""If it is passed, it would mean that anyone who builds a house on state land tomorrow can claim it as their own. That is simply unacceptable,"" he added.The rebuff came less than a week after PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti declared at a presser that her party had agreed to support NC in the Rajya Sabha election on the condition that the governing party would back its J&K (Regularisation and Recognition of Property Rights of Residents in Public Land) Bill.""BJP's threat to block the passage of PDP's land regularisation (anti-bulldozer) bill, which they branded the 'land jihad bill', was fulfilled today,"" Mehbooba wrote on X after the move was voted out. ""The chief minister, who had earlier assured that any pro-people initiative from PDP would face no obstacles under his leadership, has once again reneged on his word. This marks yet another U-turn added to his growing list of unfulfilled guarantees and promises. ""The draft of the rejected bill defines ""residents"" as those holding permanent resident certificates, which were replaced with domicile certificates after the abrogation of Article 370. PDP projects the bill as one meant to safeguard the rights of J&K residents who are being slapped with eviction notices.CM Omar harked back to the defunct Roshni Act being challenged in court and defeated despite what he said was a well-intentioned move to ""provide relief to people who had acquired legal rights over land"".""Here, this bill is justifying illegal encroachment,"" he said, urging PDP member Waheed Parra to withdraw it immediately.Parra refused to do so, accusing Omar of siding with BJP and against the interest of those living in J&K. ""BJP calls this bill 'land jihad', and now you are backing away from it? You should debate the bill; if there are any loopholes, we can fix them,"" he said.When the PDP legislator told Omar that ""even your relatives have suffered on account of this"", alluding to the controversy surrounding Hotel Nedous in Gulmarg, the CM stood up to clarify that his kin had ""a rightful lease over the land"".""But I will not bring a bill to protect my relatives"" Omar said. ""You are bringing religion and politics into this. You should not compare land for the landless with this bill.""BJP MLA Sunil Sharma applauded and thanked the CM for taking what he said was a decisive step against ""a notorious bill"" to regularise encroachment. ""Alongside terrorism, large-scale encroachment took place with the support of previous govts in J&K,"" he said.Parra told reporters outside the assembly later that his party was only voicing ""concerns about land ownership and demographic changes since the abrogation of Article 370"".","J&K CM Omar Abdullah's National Conference and BJP teamed up in the assembly for the first time Tuesday to vote out PDP's proposed ""anti-bulldozer bill"" The bill seeks to grant ownership rights to locals occupying illegal properties on state- owned land for over 20 years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124880951,imgsize-192636,width-400,resizemode-4/j-k-assembly-witnesses-uproar.jpg"

HYDERABAD: In yet another blow to CPI (Maoist), two of its prominent figures - central committee member Pulluri Prasad Rao alias Chandranna and Telangana state committee member Bandi Prakash alias Prabhath - surrendered before DGP B Shivadhar Reddy in Hyderabad on Tuesday.The surrender, carried out without arms or much fanfare, marks the exit of two senior members long seen as key strategists within the Maoist brass. The duo cited deteriorating health, deepening ideological divisions, and sustained pressure from security forces as reasons for dissociating from the armed movement.""This is in response to CM A Revanth Reddy's call to join the mainstream,"" said Reddy. ""Both Chandranna and Prabhath decided to distance themselves from the organisation due to internal rift, chronic ailments and divergence within the Maoist leadership.

He said the party was divided into two factions, and the underground cadres and members were choosing their own paths.""I want to make it clear this is not a surrender... We are joining the mainstream to fight for people (by being) among people,"" Chandranna said. He vowed to continue following the Maoist ideology, and pledged his allegiance to Thippiri Tirupati alias Devji, who he claimed was the new general secretary of the Maoist outfit.""My health is deteriorating. The chief minister called us brothers and urged us to rejoin society. But I will continue the same struggle. The Marxist Leninist Communist ideology is still alive among the people,"" he reiterated. Asked about his future plans, he said: ""Give me 15 days - I will break my silence."" The DGP said Chandranna and Bandi Prakash said had not surrendered with arms. ""The duo stated that their weapons were handed over to the party before leaving,"" he added.Officials said the surrender of Chandranna and Prabhath underscores the growing fatigue in Maoist ranks.

'NDA Coming To Power With Thumping Majority': Bihar Minister Sanjay Saraogi On Assembly Polls

NEW DELHI: Tejashwi Yadav , Pawan Khera and Dipankar Bhattacharya were present as the Mahagathbandhan unveiled its joint manifesto in Patna for the upcoming Bihar Assembly elections . Yet the spotlight also fell on who wasn’t there — another day marked by Rahul Gandhi ’s absence from the poll-bound state.The document was branded as “Tejashwi’s Prann,” featuring a prominent image of the RJD leader on its cover, with Rahul's small image at the top left — a detail that may hint at the shifting centre of gravity within the alliance.Interestingly, in 2020 the alliance titled its manifesto “Prann Humara,” avoiding any direct association with a specific leader — though Tejashwi’s image still featured on the cover. This time, however, the branding appeared far more pointed.It's been over two months since the poll-bound state got a glimpse of the Congress leader. However, he did make a digital cameo on Monday, as he extended Chhath Pooja greetings flaunting his Bhojpuri skills.""A few days ago, I had a very engaging conversation with the youth of Bihar - on education, health, employment, every issue. And, there is only one culprit responsible for their deplorable state: the BJP-JDU government,"" he said as he shared the video.The grand old party, which had the worst strike rate in the opposition camp in 2020 polls, has assured that Rahul will kickoff the Congress campaign starting October 29 and 30 in the state. Congress fielded candidates in 70 constituencies, the second-highest tally in the opposition bloc after the RJD’s 144, but managed to secure victories in only 19 of them.Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and party president Mallikarjun Kharge would follow suit. Moreover, a joint rally with Tejashwi is also being planned in Muzaffarpur and Darbhanga.Rahul Gandhi's last visit to the state was in August when he conducted 'Voter Adhikar Yatra' for 16 days, during which he covered 1,300km, 110 Assembly constituencies across 25 districts.The march was framed as a moral battle to safeguard the electoral process, urging voters to stand against what he described as “vote chori” by the ruling NDA.","The document was branded as “Tejashwi’s Prann,” featuring a prominent image of the RJD leader on its cover.

10 key points about Hurricane Melissa



Record-breaking storm slams Jamaica



Cuba braces for impact: ‘May God have mercy on us’



Tens of thousands displaced across Jamaica



‘A beast of a storm’: Meteorologists stunned by intensity



Cuban evacuations on a massive scale



Storm surge and flash flood warnings for Cuba



Families in the UK anxiously await news



Power outages and hospital evacuations in Jamaica



Seven deaths across the Caribbean so far



Scientists link intensification to climate change







Hurricane Melissa, one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record, has left a trail of destruction across Jamaica and is now heading north-northeast toward Cuba. The storm, which made landfall in Jamaica as a catastrophic Category 5 hurricane, brought winds of up to 185 mph (295 kph), massive flooding and landslides, and caused extensive damage to infrastructure. Officials are warning that the recovery process will be slow, with thousands displaced and major hospitals damaged.Prime Minister Andrew Holness said the scale of devastation was unlike anything Jamaica had ever experienced. “There is no infrastructure in the region that can withstand a Category 5,” he said. “The question now is the speed of recovery. That’s the challenge.”As Melissa approaches Cuba, authorities have evacuated over 735,000 residents, bracing for destructive winds, torrential rain, and storm surges as high as 12 feet. Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez has urged people to “be alert, show solidarity, and not forget discipline in the face of this threat.”Hurricane Melissa came ashore near New Hope, Jamaica, as a powerful Category 5 storm — tying records for the strongest Atlantic hurricane at landfall. With 185 mph winds and a central pressure of 892 millibars, Melissa equalled the intensity of the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and 2019’s Hurricane Dorian.The storm ripped roofs off homes, uprooted trees, and sent boulders crashing down roads. Prime Minister Holness described the impact as “devastating,” noting widespread damage to hospitals, homes, and businesses. Officials have confirmed at least three deaths in Jamaica, with many areas still unreachable due to blocked roads and flooding.In Santiago de Cuba and Holguín, residents are preparing for the storm’s arrival. “May God have mercy on us, because it’s coming with a lot of strength,” said Diamon Mendoza, a local resident. Elderly citizens, families with children, and farmers have sought refuge in community shelters or the homes of neighbours. State television showed people securing livestock and crops ahead of the hurricane’s landfall, expected early Wednesday.More than 800 shelters were opened before Melissa’s arrival, housing about 15,000 people. Many families remained stranded as floodwaters rose in western Jamaica, particularly in the parishes of St Elizabeth and Westmoreland. “Roofs were flying off,” said Desmond McKenzie, deputy chairman of Jamaica’s Disaster Risk Management Council. “We are hoping and praying that the situation will ease so that some attempt can be made to get to those persons. ” Roughly 540,000 customers, or 77% of the island, were left without power.Experts described Melissa’s behaviour as “extraordinary.” The storm underwent *extreme rapid intensification*, strengthening by about 70 mph in 24 hours — far exceeding typical expectations. “It’s been a remarkable, just a beast of a storm,” said hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach of Colorado State University. Despite passing near Jamaica’s mountains, Melissa retained its power, fuelled by abnormally warm ocean waters — 2°C hotter than average. Climate scientists said such superheated waters, driven by global warming, made the storm 500 to 700 times more likely to reach such strength.As Melissa bears down on eastern Cuba, more than 735,000 people have been evacuated, according to President Díaz-Canel. The government has focused on moving residents from coastal and mountainous regions, where flash floods and landslides pose major threats. In Holguín province alone, over 200,000 residents were relocated. “It will be a very difficult night for all of Cuba, but we will recover,” the president said, urging citizens to remain disciplined and resilient.Meteorologists warn that Cuba’s southeastern coast could experience storm surges between 8 and 12 feet above normal tides, accompanied by large, destructive waves. Rainfall of 10 to 20 inches, with localised totals up to 25 inches in mountainous regions, could trigger catastrophic flash flooding. CNN meteorologist Briana Waxman cautioned that Melissa’s clearer eye suggests it is reorganising — potentially regaining Category 4 strength just before landfall.Members of the Jamaican diaspora are desperately seeking updates from loved ones back home. Ambrosine Townsend, who lives in Kent, said she had been unable to contact her sister in Long Bay since Sunday afternoon. “Even though I trust her, I tried to persuade her to leave,” she said. “Because I know that things can change.” Many families in the UK and US have faced days of silence as communications remain down across much of Jamaica.Several hospitals were severely damaged during the storm, forcing emergency evacuations. One major facility lost power entirely, and 75 patients had to be moved to safer locations. Emergency services struggled to operate amid the chaos, with communications cut and floodwaters blocking key routes. “We have boats, helicopters, you name it,” said McKenzie. “The government is ready for rescues as soon as it’s safe. ”At least seven people have died across the Caribbean, including three in Jamaica, three in Haiti, and one in the Dominican Republic, where another person remains missing. While Jamaica braces for a full damage assessment, officials fear the toll could rise as rescue teams reach isolated areas. UN agencies and NGOs have pre-positioned food, medicine, and relief supplies to support recovery efforts once conditions allow.Meteorologists say Melissa’s power underscores a troubling trend. Thirteen Category 5 storms have formed in the Atlantic since 2016 — more than any other 10-year period in recorded history. “We’re seeing a direct connection between warmer waters and rapid intensification,” said Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist for Climate Central. “When these storms go over extremely warm water, it is more fuel for them to explode. ”(With inputs from agencies)","Hurricane Melissa is one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record. Storm has left a trail of destruction across Jamaica and is now heading north- northeast toward Cuba. Storm brought winds of up to 185 mph (295 kph), massive flooding and landslides. Officials are warning that the recovery process will be slow, with thousands displaced and major hospitals damaged.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124887841,imgsize-736608,width-400,resizemode-4/hurricane-melissa.jpg"

An ""aggressive"" rhesus monkey infected with Covid, hepatitis C and herpes escaped in Mississippi on Tuesday afternoon after a truck carrying the diseased laboratory primates overturned on an interstate, officials said.The truck, transporting a consignment of rhesus monkeys from a research centre affiliated with Tulane University, careened into a ditch north of Heidelberg, the Jasper County Sheriff’s Department reported.The 40-pound monkeys carry Covid, hepatitis C and herpes and are “aggressive to humans,” the department warned. It added that humans should not handle the animals without PPE, New York Post reported.The crash damaged the cages and allowed the primates to flee into a nearby valley. It is unclear how many monkeys were aboard, but all those who escaped were quickly seized and euthanised except for one still on the lam.The department advised anyone who sees the fugitive monkey to call 911 and stay as far away from it as possible.Tulane University refuted the sheriff’s department’s claim that the animals were infectious. “Non-human primates at the Tulane National Biomedical Research Center are provided to other research organizations to advance scientific discovery.The primates in question belong to another entity and are not infectious. We are actively collaborating with local authorities and will send a team of animal care experts to assist as needed,” the university said in a statement.As of 2 pm on Tuesday, the sheriff’s office was still scouring the area for the loose monkey with assistance from Mississippi Wildlife and Fisheries and an animal disposal company. An adult rhesus monkey typically weighs between 9 and 26 pounds, depending on its sex.Their genetic similarity to humans makes them common subjects for research. The average mature female rhesus produces at least one offspring per year, National Geographic notes, so the species’ population base is of little concern. Rhesus monkeys have a long history of supporting scientific advancement. Among them was Albert II, the first monkey the United States sent into space in 1948, and rhesus antigens helped doctors identify different human blood groups.","A truck carrying a consignment of rhesus monkeys from a Tulane University research centre careened into a ditch north of Heidelberg, Mississippi.

UN slams raid; warns of 'extreme lethal consequences'







At least 64 people, including 4 police officials died on Tuesday in Rio de Janeiro in the most deadly police operation ever, targeting the Comando Vermelho gang days before the city hosts global events related to the United Nations climate summit known as COP30.Next week Rio hosts the C40 global summit of mayors tackling climate change and Prince William’s Earthshot Prize, which will feature celebrities including pop star Kylie Minogue and four-time Formula One world champion Sebastian Vettel, Reuters reported.The programming is part of the run-up to COP30, the United Nations climate summit held in the Amazon city of Belem from November 10 to November 21.The death toll, confirmed by Rio Governor Claudio Castro on Tuesday was more than twice Rio’s most deadly previous police operation.“We stand firm confronting narcoterrorism,” Castro wrote on social media about the operation, which he said involved 2,500 security personnel across the Alemao and Penha favela complexes, near the city’s international airport. Rio’s favelas are poor, densely populated settlements woven through the city’s hilly oceanside terrain.In a post on X, he shared a video of himself speaking in Brazilian and said, ""I continue to closely follow this historic day in the fight against crime in Rio de Janeiro.I have just made an important decision for our state, which will help us define the next steps in this struggle.""Several videos going viral on social media showing smoke coming out early on Tuesday over the iconic skyline as gangs burnt cars to slow the advance of armoured vehicles while bursts of gunfire rang out.Police released videos showing suspects using drones armed with grenades against the police. The footage also showed armed men fleeing into a forested area near the operation.Sobbing family members gathered outside of a public hospital attending to those injured. The Rio state govt called Tuesday’s operation the largest ever targeting the Comando Vermelho gang.Castro confirmed 81 arrests as authorities sought to serve 250 arrest and search warrants in an operation targeting alleged drug kingpins and their money laundering operations.However some civil society groups criticised the heavy casualties in a military-style operation. Carolina Ricardo, executive director at security think tank Sou da Paz, called it a tragedy. “This is a completely failed approach, because it does not actually target the links in the drug production chain,” she said.The UN human rights office said that it was “horrified” by police raids in Rio de Janeiro that left at least 64 people dead, calling for a swift and transparent investigation.The massive operation — involving some 2,500 heavily armed officers — targeted Brazil’s main drug-trafficking gang in two impoverished northern neighborhoods.“We are horrified by the ongoing police operation in Rio’s favelas, reportedly resulting in the deaths of over 60 people, including four police officers,” the UN rights office said in a statement on X.It warned, ""this deadly operation furthers the trend of extreme lethal consequences of police operations in Brazil’s marginalized communities.

Cognitive confusion: Donald Trump refers to dementia screening as 'very hard' IQ test,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cognitive-confusion-donald-trump-refers-to-dementia-screening-as-very-hard-iq-test/articleshow/124883425.cms,"What Trump said and how he framed it

What the test really is

The MoCA is a 10-to-15-minute cognitive screening tool designed to detect early signs of dementia or cognitive impairment . It assesses memory, attention, language, visuospatial skills and orientation.

. It assesses memory, attention, language, visuospatial skills and orientation. Neurologist Ziad Nasreddine, who developed the MoCA, has stated clearly: “There are no studies showing that this test is correlated to IQ tests. The purpose of it was not to determine persons who have a low IQ level.”

Media analysis confirms that while Trump bragged about passing an “IQ test,” experts and documents show the exam used was a dementia screening , not an IQ or intelligence test.





President Donald Trump claimed during a press briefing aboard Air Force One on October 27, 2025 that he had taken an “IQ test” at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and achieved a perfect score, challenging Democratic Representatives Jasmine Crockett and Alexandria Ocasio‑Cortez to take the same exam.In reality, the question test appears to have been the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)—a brief screening tool for early cognitive decline, not an intelligence (IQ) test, according to People. The discrepancy between what was claimed and what experts say the test measures raises questions about transparency, health communication, and political messaging.Trump described the test as “very hard” and suggested it was akin to an aptitude or cognitive exam:“They have Jasmine Crockett, a low IQ person. AOC is low IQ… You give her an IQ test, have her pass, like, the exams that I decided to take when I was at Walter Reed… I took- Those are very hard- They’re really aptitude tests, I guess, in a certain way, but they’re cognitive tests.”He also recounted what he said were sample questions:“The first couple questions are easy: a tiger, an elephant, a giraffe, you know. When you get up to about five or six and then when you get up to 10 and 20 and 25, they couldn’t come close to answering any of those questions.”Globally, questions about the health and cognitive fitness of older political leaders are increasingly common. Screening tools exist to identify early impairment, but they are not designed to evaluate intelligence or overall leadership capacity. Media literacy around such tests remains low; when high-profile figures misuse or mislabel them, public misunderstanding grows.","President Donald Trump claimed he passed an “IQ test” at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and achieved a perfect score.

'Powerful strikes': Israel hits Gaza amid fragile ceasefire; over 30 killed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/powerful-strikes-israel-hits-gaza-amid-fragile-ceasefire-over-30-killed-claims-hamas/articleshow/124886523.cms,"Israel Allows Hamas Fighters To Enter Occupied Gaza Areas In Search For Remains Of Hostages

Ceasefire strains amid hostage dispute







At least 30 people have been killed and dozens wounded in fresh Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip, Gaza’s civil defence agency told AFP on Wednesday, in what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described as “powerful strikes” against Hamas. The assault came despite an ongoing ceasefire brokered by the United States earlier this month.Mahmud Basal, spokesman for Gaza’s civil defence, said emergency crews were “still working to recover the dead and wounded from under the rubble”. The agency reported at least three strikes across Gaza, including one near the Al-Shifa hospital and another that killed five people when their vehicle was hit.The Israeli military said the operation was in response to Hamas attacking its troops in Rafah — a claim Hamas has denied. Defence Minister Israel Katz accused the group of crossing “a bright red line”, warning, “Hamas’s attack today on IDF soldiers in Gaza will be met with great force.”US Vice President JD Vance, however, maintained that the ceasefire “is holding” despite what he called “little skirmishes”. Speaking to reporters, Vance added, “We know that Hamas or somebody else within Gaza attacked an IDF soldier. We expect the Israelis are going to respond, but I think the president’s peace is going to hold.”The renewed violence comes amid deepening mistrust over the return of hostage remains, a key component of the ceasefire agreement. Israel accused Hamas of staging a fake recovery operation after the group handed over partial remains of a captive whose body had already been returned two years ago.“It is unacceptable that a fake recovery was staged when so many families are still awaiting news,” the Red Cross said in a rare statement, confirming it was misled during the handover.Hamas insists it remains committed to the truce and is “determined to hand over the bodies of Israeli captives as soon as possible once they are located”. The group said Israeli bombardments were hampering recovery efforts in Gaza’s ruins.The ceasefire, brokered by President Donald Trump’s administration on 10 October, has so far failed to stop intermittent violence. According to Gaza’s health ministry, at least 68,531 people have been killed since the war began in October 2023, when Hamas’s attack on Israel left 1,221 dead and over 250 taken hostage.As the strikes continued, Gaza resident Abdul-Hayy al-Hajj Ahmed voiced fears of another full-scale conflict. “Now they accuse Hamas of stalling, and that is a pretext for renewed escalation and war,” he told AFP. “We want to rest. I believe the war will come back.”","At least 30 people have been killed and dozens wounded in fresh Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip, Gaza’s civil defence agency said.

North Korea successfully test-fired sea-to-surface cruise missiles into its western waters, just hours before US President Donald Trump heads to South Korea on Wednesday for the final leg of his Asia trip.The missiles flew for more than two hours before accurately striking targets, according to North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency. The agency claimed that the weapons would contribute to expanding the operational sphere of the country’s nuclear-armed military.The North Korean report came hours before an expected summit between Trump and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung in the city of Gyeongju, where South Korea is hosting this year’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings and US president is also scheduled to hold a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping , AP news reported.KCNA said the tests were attended by senior military official Pak Jong Chon, who also inspected training for sailors aboard North Korea’s newly developed destroyers Choe Hyon and Kang Kon, which leader Kim Jong Un has described as key assets in his efforts to strengthen the navy.Trump expressed interest in meeting with Kim during his stay in South Korea, however, South Korean officials said a Trump–Kim meeting was unlikely.North Korea has shunned any form of talks with Washington and Seoul since Kim’s high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with Trump fell apart in 2019 during the American President’s first term.Kim’s top foreign policy priority is now Russia. In recent months, he sent thousands of troops and large quantities of military equipment to help fuel President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine, while embracing the idea of a “new Cold War” and positioning his country as part of a united front against the US-led West.Last month, Kim reiterated he would not return to talks with the United States unless Washington dropped its demand for North Korea’s denuclearisation, after Trump repeatedly expressed his hopes for new diplomacy.","The missiles flew for more than two hours before accurately striking targets, according to North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency.

A US Navy helicopter and a fighter jet crashed separately during routine operations over the South China Sea on Sunday, with no fatalities reported. The incidents coincided with US President Donald Trump’s visit to the region for the Asean Summit in Kuala Lumpur.According to the US Navy’s Pacific Fleet, the first crash involved an MH-60R Sea Hawk helicopter that “went down in the waters of South China Sea while conducting routine operations from the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz.” All three crew members aboard were rescued by search and rescue teams, the statement said.Roughly 30 minutes later, a Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornet fighter jet also crashed into the South China Sea “while conducting routine operations” from the same carrier. Both crew members successfully ejected and were safely recovered, the US navy confirmed.The US navy said on social media Sunday evening that the MH-60R Seahawk, assigned to the “Battle Cats” of Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron (HSM) 73, went down around 2:45pm local time. “Search-and-rescue crews rescued three crew members,” the statement said.At 3:15pm, an F/A-18F Super Hornet assigned to the “Fighting Redcocks” of Strike Fighter Squadron (VFA) 22 also went down while conducting routine operations from the USS Nimitz.“All personnel involved are safe and in stable condition,” the US navy said. “The cause of both incidents is currently under investigation.”The crashes took place as US President Trump embarked on a diplomatic tour across Asia, where he is scheduled to meet Chinese leader Xi Jinping for discussions centered on trade. Relations between Washington and Beijing have been tense in recent weeks after both sides imposed new economic measures on each other.These incidents follow the loss of two Super Hornet jets in the Red Sea earlier this spring. Each F/A-18 fighter jet costs over $60 million, according to the Navy.

Cardi B says falling s*x work rates reflect a deeper financial crisis

Cardi B takes aim at Donald Trump and calls out voter regret





Cardi B has never been one to sugarcoat her opinions, and her latest viral moment proves she still has her finger firmly on the pulse of everyday financial struggles. The chart-topping rapper took to Instagram Live and delivered a fiery breakdown of what she sees as the clearest sign that the economy is spiraling: even luxury-loving sex workers are cutting their rates to survive.In true Cardi B fashion, her commentary was bold, blunt and packed with humor. But beneath her delivery was a message about how rising costs and shrinking wages are affecting people across the country.“You know how you know that the economy is bad? Because not even the prostitutes is getting fly. Where have you seen a hoe with a good Chanel bag?” she said, incredulous in her Instagram live. She continued roasting the situation with her signature flair, adding, “B*tches was buying Chanel bags like they was f**king female rappers… The h*es was selling p***y for $10,000. Now the bitches is going for $2,500. ‘Cause the f**king economy is bad. ”Her point: when a high-demand industry known for extravagant spending pulls back, everyone should be paying attention.Economists typically rely on charts and job reports to tell the story of financial downturns. Cardi B?

Bryce Mitchell compares Trump to the beast from Revelation 13:3

Bryce Mitchell, a 31-year-old UFC fighter from Arkansas, has turned against Donald Trump after spending years praising him. Mitchell once said he would “take a bullet” for Trump and fully trusted him.

His sudden shift has shocked many fans because he was one of Trump’s loudest supporters.Bryce Mitchell said the first reason he changed his mind is because Trump did not release the Jeffrey Epstein files. He said both Democrats and Republicans are asking for those files to be released, but Trump has done nothing about it.Bryce Mitchell said he expected the truth to come out, but it never did. He also said Donald Trump is sending U.S. tax money to Ukraine and Israel, just like past leaders did, and he called that a betrayal.Mitchell said Trump is even blaming American beef farmers for the rising price of beef, which he strongly disagrees with.Bryce Mitchell has a long history of extreme public statements. In the past, he claimed Israel carried out the 9/11 attacks and even said Adolf Hitler was a “good guy” he would “go fishing with.”He also once claimed Brazilian UFC fighter Jean Silva was “possessed by demons.” Mitchell has always been known for making bold and shocking claims, but his complete flip on Trump has gained major attention online.In his video, Bryce Mitchell asked people to read Revelation 13:3 from the Bible. He said he now believes Donald Trump is the “beast” mentioned in that Bible verse, which describes a powerful leader followed by the whole world.Bryce Mitchell said Donald Trump “talked a good game” and tricked him, and now he is no longer on Trump’s side.

'It's too bad': Donald Trump on learning he can't run for US President for a third term; can he change it?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/its-too-bad-donald-trump-on-learning-he-cant-run-for-us-president-for-a-third-term-can-he-change-it/articleshow/124887412.cms,"Donald Trump





US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he is ""not allowed"" to contest for a third presidential term, even though he currently has what he calls his strongest polling numbers.""I have my highest poll numbers that I've ever had, and you know, based on what I read, I guess I'm not allowed to run, so we'll see what happens... It's too bad,"" Trump said aboard Air Force One.Trump also indicated that he does not plan to take legal steps to challenge the rule that limits presidents to two terms. ""If you read it, it's pretty clear, I'm not allowed to run it's too bad,"" he told reporters while travelling to South Korea, as quoted by news agency Associated Press.Under the 22nd Amendment of the US Constitution, a president cannot be elected more than twice. The amendment says: ""No person shall be elected to the office of the president more than twice, and no person who has held the office of president, or acted as president, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected president shall be elected to the office of the president more than once.""Despite this, the idea of a third term has been raised multiple times by Trump and his supporters.Trump has previously joked about remaining in office for 25 years. During a recent meeting with congressional leaders, hats reading ""Trump 2028"" were seen on his desk. Some Republican leaders have also publicly supported the possibility. Last week, Steve Bannon — a former Trump adviser — claimed there was a ""plan"" that could allow Trump to seek another term, though he did not explain how.On October 27, Trump was asked by reporters about running again. Trump answered: ""I haven't really thought about it. But I have the best poll numbers that I've ever had.""To change the Constitution, two-thirds of both the House of Representatives and the Senate must approve the amendment, followed by ratification from three-fourths of US states. While Republicans currently control both chambers of Congress, they do not have the required two-thirds majority. Democrats currently control 18 state legislatures.Supporters of Trump have pointed to a possible legal path around the restriction. They argue that the amendment only mentions being ""elected"" and does not prohibit a person from becoming president through ""succession."" Following this argument, Trump could run as vice president in 2028 with another candidate — possibly his current vice president, JD Vance. If they won, the elected president could resign, allowing Trump to return to the presidency.Bannon told The Economist: ""Trump is going to be president in '28, and people ought to just get accommodated with that. At the appropriate time, we'll lay out what the plan is.""Trump, however, downplayed the possibility of using a succession strategy. ""I think people wouldn't like that,"" he said. ""It's too cute. It wouldn't be right.""Trump has kept the discussion about a third term open, but he has not given any details about how he plans to pursue it.","US President Donald Trump says he is ""not allowed"" to run for a third term.

Trump’s Top Lawyer Sparks Outrage After Confusing Two of America’s Most Sacred Documents





A Trump acolyte of Sikh faith is getting roasted by her MAGA bros after standing up for immigrant truckers who are the receiving end of nativist fury in America.Harmeet Dhillon, a California Attorney who heads the civil rights division in the Trump administration’s Department of Justice, is finding out that being part of the MAGAsphere does not provide any cover against racist rage-baits – an experience other Indian-American Trump loyalists like Kash Patel Vivek Ramaswamy , and Dinesh D’Souza, are also facing. A recent Diwali message from Patel, a die-hard Trump loyalist, drew floods of vitriol, including calls to ""go back to India,"" ""go back home and worship your sand demons. ""Following reports of immigrant Sikh drivers facing racial profiling after two members of the community were involved in fatal accident, Dhillon attacked her Democrat-run home state of California for its “absurd coddling of illegal aliens,” by issuing commercial drivers license without adequate checks, but urged Americans not to discriminate against all immigrant drivers.“Those responsible for these tragedies must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law…Unfortunately, in the fog of outrage, some are using these tragedies as an opportunity to attack law-abiding Sikhs and Indian-origin drivers, simply because of who they are,” she wrote in a post on X.“It is illegal under federal law to discriminate against individuals or attack or violently threaten them because of their race, color, religion, or national origin. The @CivilRights will aggressively prosecute or pursue justice against those engaged in such discrimination,” she warned.Blowback from MAGA nativists was swift, with scores of scorching smackdowns. “Indian appointee protecting Indian immigrants stealing jobs from Americans.Who could have seen that coming?” wrote one troll. “ Another chimed in, “I, for one, am shocked that an indian is threatening to wield her power against Americans on behalf of her co-ethnics. You are Indian, and you ran cover for your India bros.”A long-time Republican, Dhillon has been long known for work on discrimination against Sikhs and other South Asians, including her past association with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), an organization anathema to the MAGA diehards.Although she has since gravitated to the Trump orbit, she, like some of her fellow Indian-Americans are feeling the nativist MAGA burn that does not spare people of color. At the same time, they are also facing ridicule from the so-called “Radical Left” which is taunting them for “not being white enough.”The twin fatal trucking accidents involving Sikh drivers though has brought out the beast from the MAGA belly. Even though the American Trucking Association (ATA) estimates a current driver shortage of 60,000 that could go up to 160,000 by 2030 if unaddressed, MAGA activists are arguing that the U.S has sufficient number of native-born truckers, and immigrant drivers are simply undercutting the wages of native drivers – the same argument made on the H1B front, where Corporate America is saying the U.S does not have enough skilled tech workers and MAGA nativists are saying that is a false claim by tech companies seeking to cut costs with immigrant guest workers.According to the ATA, the shortage of truckers is driven by fewer native-born Americans taking to long-haul driving because of ""lifestyle challenges"" ( long hours, time away from family, tough conditions etc). The median age of American truckers is 46, and without immigrants drivers, replacement levels will not keep pace with retirements. The Association has warned, among other things, of potential supply chain disruptions, higher shipping costs passed to consumers, and overworked drivers risking safety.But for now MAGA has driven those concerns off the road, ratcheting up a campaign against immigrant drivers on the basis of two accidents involving Sikh drivers -- from the 5000 fatal accidents annually in America.","Harmeet Dhillon, a California Attorney who heads the civil rights division in the Trump administration’s Department of Justice, is finding out that being part of the MAGAsphere does not provide any cover against racist rage-baits.

Netanyahu strikes Gaza: Donald Trump explains why Israelis should hit back; maintains ‘nothing would jeopardise ceasefire’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/netanyahu-strikes-gaza-donald-trump-explains-why-israelis-should-hit-back-maintains-nothing-would-jeopardise-ceasefire/articleshow/124886845.cms,"Israel’s Gaza War 2.0? Netanyahu Minister Drops Bombshell As Hamas Drags Feet On Dead Hostages

Ceasefire tensions rise over hostage remains dispute



Is Israel-Gaza heading towards another war?







US President Donald Trump on Wednesday on Air Force One said ""nothing"" would jeopardise the ceasefire in Gaza, but added Israel ""should hit back"" if its soldiers were killed.Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israel carried out three strikes on Tuesday despite the ongoing ceasefire, killing 30 people, after the Israeli military accused Hamas of attacking its troops and violating the US-brokered truce, Reuters reported.""As I understand it, they took out an Israeli soldier,"" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One. ""So the Israelis hit back and they should hit back. When that happens, they should hit back,"" he added.""Nothing is going to jeopardize"" the ceasefire, Trump said. ""You have to understand Hamas is a very small part of peace in the Middle East, and they have to behave.""""If they (Hamas) are good, they are going to be happy and if they are not good, they are going to be terminated, their lives will be terminated,"" Trump said.""Nobody knows what happened to the Israeli soldier but they say it was sniper fire. And it was retribution for that, and I think they have a right to do that.""Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered ""powerful strikes"" on Gaza, his office said, as Defence Minister Israel Katz accused Hamas of attacking Israeli troops in Gaza.""Hamas's attack today on IDF (Israel Defense Forces) soldiers in Gaza is a crossing of a bright red line, to which the IDF will respond with great force,"" Katz said in a statement.Renewed violence between Israel and Hamas has strained the fragile ceasefire in the Gaza Strip amid deepening mistrust over the return of hostage remains, a key element of the truce agreement.Israel accused Hamas of reneging by not returning them, but the Palestinian Islamist group said it would take time to locate the remains amid Gaza’s war-ravaged ruins, according to AFP.Hamas later said it would delay Tuesday’s handover, adding that Israeli “escalation will hinder the search, excavation, and recovery of the bodies”. In a further statement on Telegram, Hamas’s armed wing said it had found the bodies of two hostages on Tuesday. It did not say when it would hand them over.Hamas had come under mounting pressure after it returned on Monday partial remains of a previously recovered captive, which Israel said was a breach of the truce.Hamas had said the remains were the 16th of 28 hostage bodies it had agreed to return under the ceasefire deal, which came into effect on October 10. But Israeli forensic examination determined Hamas had in fact handed over partial remains of a hostage whose body had already been brought back to Israel around two years ago, according to Netanyahu’s office.Israeli govt spokeswoman Shosh Bedrosian accused Hamas of staging the discovery of the remains. ""I can confirm to you today that Hamas dug a hole in the ground yesterday, placed the partial remains... inside of it, covered it back up with dirt, and handed it over to the Red Cross,"" she told journalists.The Hostages and Missing Families Forum urged the govt to “act decisively against these violations” and accused Hamas of knowing the location of the missing hostages.Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem rejected claims the group knows where the remaining bodies are, arguing that Israel’s bombardment during the two-year war had left locations unrecognisable.""The movement is determined to hand over the bodies of the Israeli captives as soon as possible once they are located,"" he told AFP.Hamas has already returned all 20 living hostages as agreed in the ceasefire deal.After the violation of the ceasefire, it seems that the situation which was becoming normal for Israel and Gaza is now slowly turning back to the original term.Israel have already started to attack Gaza and as witnessed in history Hamas may also retaliate.However both Trump and Vice President JD Vance said that this will not affect the ceasefire. US Vice President JD Vance said the ceasefire was holding despite Tuesday's ""skirmishes"".""That doesn't mean that there aren't going to be little skirmishes,"" said the vice president, one of several top US officials to rush to Israel last week to shore up the fragile ceasefire brokered by President Donald Trump.""We know that Hamas or somebody else within Gaza attacked an IDF soldier. We expect the Israelis are going to respond -- but I think the president's peace is going to hold,"" he added.The ceasefire, brokered by President Donald Trump’s administration on 10 October, has so far failed to stop intermittent violence.

Top doctor reveals why Trump suddenly got an MRI scan: 'Undisclosed medical problems...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/top-doctor-reveals-why-trump-suddenly-got-an-mri-scan-undisclosed-medical-problems-/articleshow/124858277.cms,"Trump Slips Up, Admits MRI At Walter Reed In Latest 'Routine Physical' Checkup At Medical Centre

The consultation



'Perfect' results



No MRI without a clear reason



Medications







A top American cardiologist has suggested that President Donald Trump may have quietly undergone an MRI scan due to potential neurological or cardiovascular symptoms.Dr Jonathan Reiner is a professor of medicine at George Washington University. He is also a former cardiologist to ex-vice president Dick Cheney.Reiner told CNN that MRIs are never performed as part of a routine check-up, implying that Trump’s test was probably forced due to symptoms.“Typically, they’re prompted by symptoms,” Reiner explained. “They can be neurologic symptoms that prompt an MRI. They could be back pain that prompts an MRI. There can be issues with the heart that would prompt an MRI. And for those reasons, the public should really be told, you know, why did the president undergo the test, what consultants he saw, and what was the result of the testing?”79-year-old Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that he had received an MRI, calling the results “perfect.” When asked about why the scan was done, he redirected questions to his doctors and added, “I gave you the full results. We had an MRI… you know the whole thing. And it was perfect.”The White House has not disclosed the reason for the MRI, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt describing it as part of a “routine health check.” However, Reiner strongly disagreed, saying, “An MRI is never part of a routine evaluation, whether you’re president of the United States or whether you’re just a civilian.”Public health physician Dr Vin Gupta supported Reiner’s statement, writing on X, “Even if you are leader of the free world, you don’t just get an MRI without a clear reason to do so. There’s no such thing as a ‘screening’ MRI.”Concerns about Trump’s health have grown in recent months after several public appearances showed him with visible bruises on his hands and a noticeably uneven gait. At times, he appeared slower on his feet and struggled with short-term recollection.The White House announced in July that Trump suffers from chronic venous insufficiency, a condition in which veins struggle to send blood from the legs back to the heart. Reiner suggested that Trump’s visible bruising and cankles might be linked to blood-thinning medication, which is commonly prescribed for cardiovascular issues.“There are a lot of things that can do that,” Reiner said. “The most common cause for bruising in the back of a 79-year-old person’s hand is medications. And the typical medication that causes that would be a blood thinner.”He added that people usually take such drugs with conditions like pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, or atrial fibrillation. “People who take blood thinners for atrial fibrillation typically are on them indefinitely, and the side effects of medications like that are bruising,” Reiner said.He concluded that the key question is not just what the MRI showed, but why it was ordered. “Why he would have an MRI depends on the underlying reason for either that medication or other undisclosed medical problems. It is just as important why he had the test as what the test showed.”","Dr Jonathan Reiner is a professor of medicine at George Washington University.

Storm devastates Jamaica: Hurricane Hunters film inside eye of Category 5 Melissa — Watch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/storm-devastates-jamaica-hurricane-hunters-film-inside-eye-of-category-5-melissa-watch/articleshow/124864582.cms,"Hurricane Melissa Turns Into STRONGEST STORM On Earth This Year; Jamaica, Cuba ‘On Knees’

Jamaica braces for its strongest storm in 174 years

Cuba and the Bahamas next in line





Jaw-dropping videos shot from inside the eye of Category 5 Hurricane Melissa have stunned viewers across the world, offering a rare glimpse of nature’s fury at its most extreme. One clip, recorded by a US Air Force “Hurricane Hunter” crew, shows the so-called “stadium effect” — towering clouds curving around a calm blue centre — as the aircraft cuts through the storm’s core.The footage, filmed on multiple passes through Melissa, quickly went viral. “Third pass through Melissa. GoPro in side window as different camera looking forward shooting in ultra high res 8K,” wrote pilot and storm chaser @FlynonymousWX, who shared the video on X. He described the mission as “very powerful but relatively straightforward” compared to earlier flights that faced intense turbulence and “nasty meso activity. ”The US Air Force Reserve’s 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, based at Keesler Air Force Base in Mississippi, is the only operational unit in the world to routinely fly into hurricanes. The team, known as the “Hurricane Hunters,” collects vital data for the U.S. National Hurricane Center to forecast the storm’s strength and path.Hurricane Melissa made landfall in Jamaica early Tuesday, bringing winds of up to 175 mph (282 km/h) and torrential rain.The U.S. National Hurricane Center warned of “catastrophic and life-threatening” flooding, landslides and storm surges reaching up to 13 feet along the southern coast.Prime Minister Andrew Holness described the hurricane as the island’s most violent in recorded history, saying: “There is no infrastructure in the region that can withstand a Category 5. The question now is the speed of recovery — that’s the challenge.”Despite evacuation orders, many residents chose to remain in their homes. “I’m not moving. I don’t believe I can run from death,” said Roy Brown, a plumber in Kingston’s Port Royal district. Others cited poor conditions in public shelters. “I have no choice but to be here,” said Sandra Walker, a vendor in St Elizabeth, who feared losing her livelihood.Officials reported landslides, widespread power cuts, and at least three storm-related deaths. “It’s nothing to play with,” warned Environment Minister Matthew Samuda, urging Jamaicans to stay indoors.After battering Jamaica, Melissa is expected to move north towards Cuba late Tuesday before crossing the Bahamas. Cuban authorities began evacuating more than 600,000 people from coastal regions, including the eastern provinces of Santiago de Cuba and Guantánamo, amid fears of severe flooding and a storm surge up to 20 inches high.The storm has already claimed at least seven lives across the Caribbean — three in Jamaica, three in Haiti, and one in the Dominican Republic — and displaced thousands. In Haiti, officials reported crop destruction and flooding in multiple provinces, worsening the country’s hunger crisis.Meteorologists warn that Melissa’s slow speed could amplify destruction, as its rains linger over affected areas. “Water kills a lot more people than wind,” said climate scientist Kerry Emanuel, adding that human-driven warming is making such rapid intensification events more frequent.As Jamaican authorities prepare for what could be the strongest storm since records began 174 years ago, Prime Minister Holness urged calm but vigilance: “You have been warned. It’s now up to you to make the right decision.”","Hurricane Melissa made landfall in Jamaica early Tuesday, bringing winds of up to 175 mph (282 km/h) and torrential rain.

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he expects “a lot of problems” to be resolved during his upcoming meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, but indicated that the sensitive issue of Taiwan might not come up in their talks, reported AFP.Speaking to reporters aboard air force one, Trump said, “I think we're going to have a great meeting with President Xi of China, and a lot of problems are going to be solved.”When asked whether the two leaders would discuss Taiwan, Trump replied, “I don't know that we'll even speak about Taiwan.

Surgeons removed a genetically modified pig kidney from a 67-year-old man last week, nearly nine months after he received the pioneering procedure at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, officials said on Monday. The kidney was removed ""after a period of decreasing kidney function,"" according to a statement from the hospital.The patient, Tim Andrews, lived with the pig kidney for a record-setting 271 days.He was the fourth person in the US to receive a genetically modified pig kidney. The first two patients died shortly after their transplants; the third had her kidney removed after 130 days, when her body rejected the organ.""Tim set a new bar in xenotransplantation,"" the Mass General Brigham statement said, referring to the process of transplanting organs from one species into another.Andrews ""will now resume dialysis and remain on the list for a human donor kidney,"" the hospital added.The nation faces an acute shortage of human organs. More than 100,000 people are on waiting lists to receive an organ transplant; roughly 90,000 of them are awaiting kidneys.The shortage has prompted an effort to genetically modify pigs so that their organs can be safely transplanted into humans.The organ Andrews received came from a pig that had received 69 edits to its genome, including some designed to disable viruses that might pose a risk to people, and others designed to make the organ more compatible with the human body, reducing the odds of immune rejection.","Tim Andrews, 67, lived with the pig kidney for a record-setting 271 days.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)





Inside a gold-drenched palace in Tokyo on Tuesday morning, President Donald Trump heaped praise on Sanae Takaichi, Japan's new prime minister, telling her that their countries were ""allies at the strongest level"" and vowing to come to Japan's aide on ""any favours you need. ""Hours later, delivering a speech to hundreds of US troops aboard an aircraft carrier stationed near Tokyo, Trump stood side by side with Takaichi, saying the two had become ""very close friends"" and adding, ""This woman is a winner.""The joint appearance, which bore all of the markings of one of Trump's political rallies, was the capstone of a day in which Trump and Takaichi found an easy rapport - watching snippets of the World Series on TV, eating lunch at Akasaka Palace in central Tokyo and sharing stories about their mutual friend, Shinzo Abe, the former premier who was assassinated in 2022.But the series of meetings between Trump and Takaichi, a hard-line conservative who last week became the first woman to serve as Japan's PM, delivered little in the way of solutions to some of the contentious trade issues between Washington and Japan.The leaders signed two vaguely worded agreements - one declaring a ""new golden age of the US-Japan alliance,"" and another to cooperate on expanding the supply chain for rare earth metals.With both countries essentially agreeing to keep negotiating, Takaichi bought more time to strategise over how to spend the $550 billion her debt-strapped govt has promised to invest as part of an earlier trade deal with the US.In front of the troops, Trump, who has been pressing Japan to spend more on defence, said he had approved an order of missiles to supply Japanese F-35 jets. ""I've just approved the first batch of missiles,"" Trump said. ""I just want to tell Madam PM, they've been waiting for those missiles, and we got them here.""During his speech at the Yokosuka Naval Base, he said Toyota would be investing ""over $10 billion"" in American plants, but otherwise the day was short on details. There was no public talk about the major point of contention between the two countries: the details of how Japan intends to spend its $550 billion investment into the US.Later, the pair toasted each other at lunch, where American rice was served alongside American beef - culinary reminders of the pressure the Trump administration has put on the Japanese to buy more American-made goods. nyt","President Donald Trump met with Japan's new PM Sanae Takaichi on Tuesday.

Setback for Trump: US Judge extends ban on firing of federal staff amid shutdown; unions hail ‘big win’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/setback-for-trump-us-judge-extends-ban-on-firing-of-federal-staff-amid-shutdown-unions-hail-big-win/articleshow/124886562.cms,"Donald Trump (file - AP)





A federal judge has extended an order preventing the Trump administration from laying off thousands of federal employees during the ongoing government shutdown - a decision hailed by labor unions as a major victory for workers.US district judge Susan Illston in San Francisco on Tuesday converted her earlier temporary restraining order (TRO) into a preliminary injunction, barring the administration from issuing reduction-in-force (RIF) notices until the federal government reopens, according to CNBC.The order comes amid the second-longest government shutdown in US history, triggered by a funding lapse. The American federation of state, county and municipal employees (AFSCME) and the American federation of government employees (AFGE) had jointly filed a lawsuit to block the Trump administration’s reported plans to terminate federal workers during the closure.“Today’s ruling is another victory for federal workers and our ongoing efforts to protect their jobs from an administration hellbent on illegally firing them,” AFSCME President Lee Saunders said in a statement. AFGE called the ruling a “big win for federal workers!”The Trump administration had reportedly issued about 4,000 RIF notices on October 10 and projected the number could exceed 10,000, CNBC reported, citing White House budget director Russell Vought.Vought, a key architect of the conservative policy blueprint Project 2025, had described the shutdown as an opportunity to downsize what President Donald Trump called “Democrat Agencies.”Judge Illston, while imposing the initial TRO on October 15, had criticized the mid-shutdown layoffs as “unprecedented in our country’s history.”Calling the injunction a crucial safeguard for public servants, Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, which represents AFSCME, said: “Our team is honored to represent the civil servants who are fighting back against President Trump’s dangerous agenda, and to have won this crucial injunction that will help stop federal workers from continuing to be targeted and harassed by this administration during the shutdown. ”The unions have also expanded their lawsuit to cover several additional agencies and officials since the shutdown began.","A federal judge has extended an order preventing the Trump administration from laying off thousands of federal employees during the ongoing government shutdown.

'Very well liked'



Mangione is a 'rule follower'

Murder of Brian Thompson





Luigi Mangione, the man accused of killing UnitedHealthCare CEO Brian Thompson , is reportedly winning admiration behind bars. The 27-year-old is facing both state and federal murder charges. The Ivy League graduate has earned the nickname “ambassador” among fellow inmates at the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in Brooklyn.According to his lawyer, Arthur Aidala Mangione has become “a model prisoner” during his 10 months in custody. “He actually has been extremely nice to brand new people who go in there,” Aidala told PEOPLE, adding that Mangione takes it upon himself to help new inmates settle in.“When people get there and they don't know what the heck is going on, he is kind of the one who welcomes them and does his best to allay their fears, and you know, kind of shows them the ropes of what life in the Metropolitan Detention Center is like, and what to do — and sometimes, more importantly, what not to do,” Aidala said.Mangione’s efforts to make others comfortable have earned him respect from both inmates and staff, with Aidala saying he is “very, very well liked.”The attorney said that Mangione “gets very high marks from people in and around the jail system” and has exhibited “exemplary behaviour” throughout his detention.Aidala explained that newcomers often face a “fear of the unknown” when entering a facility like the MDC. “You know, things that we all take for granted, that changes when you go into a facility where they control your every move,” he said. “It’s very hard to figure those things out.”Mangione’s conduct reportedly stands out for his discipline. “My understanding is that he is a rule follower, unlike a lot of folks in there,” Aidala said. “A lot of folks in there, you know, they figure out a way to get in contraband, whether that be drugs or unauthorized cell phones, and things like that. But my understanding is that he's not like that and he hasn't been written up for any violations of any sort.”Mangione remains in the general population, receiving no special treatment. His fellow inmates include Sean “Diddy” Combs, the Alexander brothers, and OneTaste founder Nicole Daedone, although there is no interaction between the male and female populations.Authorities say Mangione shot and murdered Brian Thompson on December 4, 2024. He was arrested five days later at a McDonald’s in Pennsylvania and extradited to New York. Though initially charged with terrorism-related murder counts, those were dismissed last month. He has pleaded not guilty to the remaining charges and is due back in court on December 1.",Luigi Mangione is accused of killing UnitedHealthCare CEO Brian Thompson.
