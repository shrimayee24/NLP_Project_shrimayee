NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Saturday that the Congress made a ""historic blunder"" by allowing Pakistan to become a nuclear power in the 1980s without taking action.He said Pakistan has since used ""nuclear blackmail"" to block international intervention.""At a time when nations today act decisively to neutralise nuclear threats, India’s tragic inaction during the 1980s remains a cautionary tale of what could have been—and what wasn't,"" the Assam CM said in a long post on X.Sarma said intelligence from R&AW had confirmed Pakistan’s uranium enrichment at Kahuta.In his post titled ""Congress's Historic Blunder: How India Let Pakistan Become a Nuclear State"", he claimed Israel offered help—from intel to joint strike planning. He said Jamnagar Air Base was shortlisted as a launch site and the Indian military supported a pre-emptive strike on Kahuta.""India had the capability and consensus to eliminate the threat before it became a reality. Yet at the last minute: Indira Gandhi hesitated, fearing international fallout,"" the chief minister alleged.He added that Rajiv Gandhi later ""shelved the plan, prioritising diplomacy over deterrence under foreign pressure"".According to Sarma, in 1988 Rajiv Gandhi signed a no-strike nuclear pact with Pakistan’s Benazir Bhutto, pledging not to attack each other’s nuclear sites.He noted, ""A decade later, Pakistan tested nuclear weapons in 1998. India was pulled into a costly nuclear arms race. Kargil, proxy terror wars, and cross-border strikes have since occurred under Pakistan’s nuclear shield.""""To this day, Pakistan uses nuclear blackmail to deter international action and legitimize its rogue behaviour,"" he said.Sarma also accused the CPI(M), an INDIA bloc ally, of promising in their 2024 manifesto to roll back India’s nuclear deterrent if elected.“Where strong leadership demands resolve and foresight, Congress offered caution and delay.

A major fire broke out on Saturday at the 67-storey Marina Pinnacle building in Dubai Marina, prompting a large-scale emergency response and the safe evacuation of all 3,820 residents from 764 apartments. Authorities confirmed there were no injuries.The fire, which was extinguished after nearly six hours of effort, drew swift intervention from Dubai Civil Defence teams, who worked through the night to contain the blaze. In a series of updates on X, the Dubai Media Office (DMO) said: “Specialised teams successfully evacuated all residents… prioritising their health and safety throughout the operation.”Medical and psychological support teams were on-site to assist residents. “Ambulance teams and medical staff are on site to offer full medical and mental support to the safely evacuated residents,” DMO posted at 2:09 am.Authorities also assured that temporary housing arrangements were being made in coordination with the building’s developer to ensure the affected residents' well-being.As firefighting operations continued, Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) suspended tram services between Dubai Marina Station (No.5) and Palm Jumeirah Station (No. 9) as a precautionary measure. A replacement shuttle bus service was activated, with the RTA stating, “The safety of our passengers and operations is our top priority.”Tram services will resume only after full safety inspections are conducted, the authority added.Eyewitnesses described the situation as tense, with one resident noting: “At around 1:30am, the fire started to slow down… plenty of debris has been falling.”Thanks to swift action, no surrounding buildings were affected. Authorities are now monitoring the structure and will conduct a thorough investigation to determine the cause of the fire, which remains undisclosed.This is not the first fire reported at Marina Pinnacle — also known as Tiger Tower. In May 2015, a kitchen fire on the 47th floor had spread to the floor above before being contained.Despite the building's fire history, Saturday’s operation stands out for its scale, coordination, and zero casualty outcome — underscoring Dubai’s emergency preparedness.","A major fire broke out on Saturday at the 67-storey Marina Pinnacle building in Dubai Marina, prompting a large-scale emergency response.

Suspect has been identified as Vance Boelter





Minnesota authorities have arrested Vance Boelter, 57, the primary suspect in the fatal shooting of State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark, ending an intense two-day manhunt that left the state on edge.The suspect is also accused of wounding State Senator John A. Hoffman and his wife Yvette in a separate attack at their Minneapolis suburban home. During both incidents, the assailant reportedly wore a rubber mask and posed as a law enforcement officer.Investigators discovered the suspect had compiled a notebook containing approximately 70 potential targets, including both lawmakers. Before fleeing one of the crime scenes, he allegedly opened fire on responding officers.The manhunt intensified Saturday night when SWAT teams converged on a residence in Plymouth, Minnesota, roughly 12 miles west of Minneapolis. The search expanded to Sibley County the following day, where authorities recovered the suspect's vehicle and hat, approximately an hour's drive from the attack sites.Prior to the shootings, Boelter exhibited suspicious behavior, including emptying his bank account and prepaying four months' rent – at $220 monthly – for a room he occasionally occupied in Minneapolis. The payment was made to David Carlson, who described himself as one of Boelter's closest friends since elementary school.","Vance Boelter, 57, has been identified as the primary suspect in the fatal shooting of State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark.

Trump's post





US President Donald Trump has ordered federal immigration officials to prioritise deportations in Democratic-led cities following widespread protests in Los Angeles and other major urban centers against his administration's immigration policies.In a post on Truth Social, Trump urged ICE agents ""to do all in their power to achieve the very important goal of delivering the single largest Mass Deportation Program in History.""He emphasized that to accomplish this, officials ""must expand efforts to detain and deport Illegal Aliens in America's largest Cities, such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, where Millions upon Millions of Illegal Aliens reside.""This announcement follows weeks of intensified enforcement and remarks from Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff and chief architect of Trump’s immigration strategy, who stated that ICE officers would aim for at least 3,000 arrests per day—an increase from approximately 650 daily arrests during the first five months of Trump’s second term.Simultaneously, the administration has instructed immigration agents to pause arrests at farms, restaurants, and hotels after Trump expressed concern about the negative effects of aggressive enforcement on these industries, according to a U.S. official familiar with the matter who requested anonymity.In his post, Trump said: ""Our Nation’s ICE Officers have shown incredible strength, determination, and courage as they facilitate a very important mission, the largest Mass Deportation Operation of Illegal Aliens in History.Every day, the Brave Men and Women of ICE are subjected to violence, harassment, and even threats from Radical Democrat Politicians, but nothing will stop us from executing our mission, and fulfilling our Mandate to the American People.

These, and other such Cities, are the core of the Democrat Power Center, where they use Illegal Aliens to expand their Voter Base, cheat in Elections, and grow the Welfare State, robbing good paying Jobs and Benefits from Hardworking American Citizens. These Radical Left Democrats are sick of mind, hate our Country, and actually want to destroy our Inner Cities — And they are doing a good job of it! There is something wrong with them. That is why they believe in Open Borders, Transgender for Everybody, and Men playing in Women’s Sports — And that is why I want ICE, Border Patrol, and our Great and Patriotic Law Enforcement Officers, to FOCUS on our crime ridden and deadly Inner Cities, and those places where Sanctuary Cities play such a big role.

Who is Arturo Gamboa? Armed man at Kings Day protest fired at by peacekeeper; bystander killed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-arturo-gamboa-armed-man-at-kings-day-protest-fired-at-by-peacekeeper-bystander-killed/articleshow/121870857.cms,"AP





A peacekeeper at a ""No Kings"" protest in Salt Lake City opened fire on a man who raised a rifle at the crowd, but accidentally shot and killed a bystander, police said on Sunday.The incident happened on Saturday evening during nationwide ""No Kings"" protests, where demonstrators rallied against what they called president Donald Trump’s authoritarian actions. While most protests remained peaceful, violence broke out in Salt Lake City when a man, identified as Arturo Gamboa, 24, pulled out a rifle near the protestors.According to Salt Lake City police chief Brian Redd, two men wearing neon green vests, believed to be part of the peacekeeping team, approached Gamboa with their handguns drawn. Witnesses said Gamboa raised his rifle and moved towards the crowd. One of the peacekeepers then fired three shots, hitting Gamboa and a bystander, Arthur Folasa Ah Loo, 39.Ah Loo was taken to hospital but later died from his injuries. Gamboa, who was treated for minor injuries, was arrested and charged with murder. Police accused him of creating the dangerous situation that led to Ah Loo's death.The gunfire caused panic, forcing hundreds of protestors to flee, hide behind barriers and seek shelter in nearby buildings.Police recovered an AR-15 style rifle, a gas mask, and a backpack at the scene.Authorities are still investigating why Gamboa brought the rifle to the protest and how the peacekeepers were organised or trained for the event.In another incident in Riverside, California, a driver struck a woman participating in a separate ""No Kings"" demonstration and fled. The woman was hospitalised with serious injuries but is stable. Police are still searching for the driver.The Utah chapter of the 50501 Movement, one of the groups behind the protests, condemned Gamboa’s actions and thanked first responders and their safety team for acting quickly. They did not respond to questions about the peacekeeping team’s organisation or training.","A peacekeeper at a ""No Kings"" protest in Salt Lake City opened fire on a man who raised a rifle at the crowd, but accidentally shot and killed a bystander.

NAGPUR: A simple act of courtesy and kindness — letting a sick teenager and her grandmother board the helicopter first — spared the lives of a Maharashtra couple from the fatal helicopter crash near Kedarnath on Sunday. Pooja and Pravin Mahajan, from Bhadravati in Chandrapur district, had been travelling with Pooja's sister, Shraddha Jaiswal of Wani in Yavatmal district, her husband Rajkumar, and their toddler daughter Kashi, who were among the seven killed when the chopper went down minutes after take-off.On Sunday morning, the group was waiting at the Kedarnath helipad with the Jaiswals for the first sortie to Gaurikund when an elderly woman in the queue requested that she and her unwell granddaughter be allowed to go first. Pravin agreed, letting Vinod Devi, 66, and Trishti Singh, 19, take his family's place in the queue and opting to wait for the next helicopter. Talking to TOI, Mahajan said, ""The woman requested that her granddaughter had fever and she needed to reach the Gaurikund base soon. I agreed and allowed them to board,"" he said.Rajkumar Jaiswal, 41, who was a prominent coal-transport businessman from Wani, had set out on the Char Dham yatra with his family on Thursday, fulfilling a long-held personal vow.The group reached the Kedarnath shrine at 9:30am on Saturday and was scheduled to return by noon. But due to severe weather, sorties were cancelled for the rest of the day. Flights resumed at 5am on Sunday. Two other helicopters took off around the same time and landed safely.In addition to his coal business, Jaiswal ran a retail shop and was known in his community for his devout faith and involvement in local affairs. His wife Shraddha, 35, and their 23-month-old daughter Kashi died alongside him in the crash. Their six-year-old son, Vivaan, had stayed behind in Maharashtra with his grandfather. Their elder son, who lives in a hostel, had not joined the trip either.","Pooja and Pravin Mahajan, from Bhadravati in Chandrapur district, had been travelling with Pooja's sister, Shraddha Jaiswal of Wani in Yavatmal district, and their toddler daughter Kashi.

BATHINDA: Amritpal Singh Mehron, the alleged mastermind in the killing of social media influencer Kanchan Tiwari, known as Kamal Kaur 'Bhabhi', fled to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) just hours after the crime was committed, according to police on Sunday.A look-out circular (LOC) was issued against the resident of Mehron village in Moga district on Saturday, four days after Kamal Kaur was found dead in a car parked outside Adesh Medical University here on the night of June 11.Investigations revealed that she was murdered around 2 am on June 10. Mehron - who claims to head a radical outfit called 'Qaum De Rakhe' was present with his two accomplices, Jaspreet Singh and Nimratjit Singh, when they strangulated Kamal Kaur, according to Bathinda senior superintendent of police (SSP) Amneet Kondal.Mehron allegedly took both her mobile phones and compelled her to disclose their passwords. He boarded a flight from Amritsar international airport at 9.15 am on the same day, having travelled from Bathinda to Amritsar, the SSP said.The SSP further said that information gleaned from the arrested people, Jaspreet and Nimratjit, confirmed Mehron's presence at the scene of crime. The three travelled from Moga to Ludhiana in a Scorpio SUV on June 9, then took Kamal Kaur to Bathinda under the pretext of promoting vehicles and facilitating repairs for her Hyundai Eon.The three got the car repaired in a workshop and remained with her until well past midnight.""Later, Mehron snatched both her mobiles and forcibly got the passwords by asking his accomplices to slap her,"" the SSP said, adding that she was then strangled.Mehron instructed Jaspreet and Nimratjit to park the vehicle at Adesh University. Jaspreet, upon parking the car, reportedly left the piece of cloth used in the strangulation. Following contact with Mehron, he was instructed to retrieve the item, which he subsequently did.Investigations have also indicated that two more people were aware of the crime. Mehron fled in their vehicle, instructing Jaspreet and Nimratjit to remain with the deceased. Police have nominated one Ranjit Singh from Tarn Taran while the identity of the second person is not yet known.After Mehron's travel history confirmed he took a flight to the UAE on June 10, police said they will prepare a case for his extradition. Apart from the murder case, Mehron also faces two criminal cases of allegedly threatening a producer accused of obscene songs in 2021 in Barnala and another for allegedly vandalising statues of folk dancers at the heritage street near the Golden Temple in Amritsar in 2020.Regarding the claims of sexual exploitation of Kamal, the SSP said police have yet to receive any reports , with the viscera report still awaited.","Amritpal Singh Mehron, the alleged mastermind in the killing of social media influencer Kanchan Tiwari, known as Kamal Kaur 'Bhabhi', fled to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) just hours after the crime was committed.

Dubey targets Priyanka, recalls Congress’s past on Israel, Palestine

Trump’s military spectacle draws crowds and criticism

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday demanded an apology from the Congress for falsely claiming that Pakistan’s army chief, General Asim Munir, was invited to a US military parade hosted by President Donald Trump. The White House had categorically denied the claim, calling it “false.”Speaking to ANI, BJP MP Nishikant Dubey accused the Congress of ""falling into Pakistan’s trap"" and spreading misinformation. ""For the last 2-3 days, the entire Congress party kept saying that Pakistan's Army Chief General Asim Munir is going to the US. This was a trap by Pakistan,"" he said. “Today, it is known that the White House or the US military never called Asim Munir.”A White House official confirmed this, stating, “This is false. No foreign military leaders were invited.”Dubey used the controversy to attack the Congress party's broader foreign policy history, particularly over its handling of Israel and Palestine.He criticised Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s remarks on India abstaining from a UN vote on Gaza, calling it “shameful,” and responded with a lengthy post on X. “This is what happens when you haven't studied history,” he said, pointing to India’s covert ties with Israel going back to Nehru’s era, even as it officially supported Palestine at the UN.“In 1948, Nehruji supported Palestine... but in 1950, Nehruji secretly opened his trade office Mission in Mumbai... In 1971, Indira Gandhi used Israeli weapons... In 1992, the first Israeli embassy was opened in Delhi,” he told ANI.He further alleged that after the 26/11 attacks, the Congress government under Manmohan Singh “supported terrorism and Pakistan under global pressure.” Praising Prime Minister Modi’s foreign policy, Dubey said India’s global standing has improved significantly, especially with Arab nations like Saudi Arabia.The row emerged as President Donald Trump hosted the largest US military parade in decades on Saturday to mark the 250th anniversary of the US Army—coinciding with his 79th birthday.Thousands of troops marched past the White House, with tanks rolling down Constitution Avenue and fighter jets flying overhead. The White House claimed that over 250,000 people attended the event, though no evidence was provided.Trump, who once admired France’s Bastille Day parade, declared, “Time and again, America’s enemies have learned that if you threaten the American people, our soldiers are coming for you.”While Trump’s supporters celebrated, protests erupted in major cities under the banner “No Kings,” with critics accusing the former president of authoritarianism. Tear gas was fired in Los Angeles, and a shooting at a protest in Salt Lake City left one person critically injured.","BJP MP Nishikant Dubey accuses Congress of ""falling into Pakistan’s trap"" Dubey uses controversy to attack Congress party's broader foreign policy history.

Why Venice locals are protesting against Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's wedding

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez Wedding venue

Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's wedding, set for June 24 in Venice, is facing a fierce backlash from local residents and activists. Demonstrators have unfurled banners across historic churches, including the San Giorgio Maggiore Church, with slogans like “No Space for Bezos”, signaling their frustration over the lavish event. The $10 million celebration, planned on the island of San Giorgio Maggiore, has triggered protests over blocked streets, luxury hotel takeovers, and environmental concerns, threatening to disrupt the Floating City during its peak tourist season.One of the most striking acts of dissent saw a large banner unfurled from the bell tower of the historic San Giorgio Maggiore Church. The banner, featuring a bold red 'X' slashing through Bezos's name, sent a clear visual message across the lagoon, quickly garnering attention on social media platforms. Flyers with similar slogans, including ""No space for oligarchs, no space for Bezos,"" have also been plastered across the city.The protests stem from concerns that Bezos’ wedding, scheduled for June 24-26, is turning Venice into a “playground for the ultra-wealthy”, exacerbating issues of overtourism, restricted public access, and environmental strain. Activists claim that Bezos has reserved luxury hotels, water taxis, and even an entire island, limiting movement for locals during peak tourist season.Local activist group Laboratorio Occupato Morion , which describes itself as an ""anti-fascist, anti-capitalist, anti-racist, and trans-feminist political space,"" is leading the charge against the event. Alice Bazzoli, a spokesperson for the Laboratorio Occupato Morion, a local activist group, stated: ""Bezos thinks he can buy the entire city. We refuse to let Venice be held hostage by one of the richest men in the world.""Organisers emphasise that their actions are not a personal attack on Bezos and Sanchez, but rather a broader statement against the disruptive nature of such events in a city already grappling with immense pressure.The couple is likely to host their guests at Scuola Grande della Misericordia. Built in 1310, the historical building was originally one of Venice’s Seven Scuole Grandi, a site reserved for city’s elite. The venue consists of grand frescoes by Renaissance masters such as Tintoretto, Veronese, and Pellegrini, making it one of the most opulent locations in the city. The building, which has been repurposed for exhibitions and events, can accommodate up to 1,000 guests.The wedding, scheduled for the weekend of June 24, is expected to host Hollywood stars, business moguls, and political figures.

Meghalaya Murder: ‘Kamakhya visit before consummation of marriage’: Cops say Sonam used temple ruse to lure husband Raja Raghuvanshi to northeast,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/kamakhya-visit-before-consummation-of-marriage-cops-say-sonam-used-temple-ruse-to-lure-husband-raja-raghuvanshi-to-northeast/articleshow/121793341.cms,"Raja Raghuvanshi from Indore was killed during his honeymoon in Meghalaya. His wife, Sonam, allegedly planned the murder with her boyfriend, Raj Kushwaha. They hired three contract killers.

Poll Should there be stricter laws for preventing domestic violence and murder? Yes, definitely. No, current laws are sufficient.

NEW DELHI: Raja Raghuvanshi, the Indore-based businessman murdered during his honeymoon in Meghalaya, had been convinced by his wife Sonam to delay consummating the marriage until after a ritual offering at the Kamakhya Temple in Guwahati — a ruse investigators now say was part of a sinister plot to lure him to the Northeast and have him killed in a remote location.“Sonam told Raja that they should first visit the Kamakhya Devi Temple and offer prayers before consummating the marriage,” a senior investigating officer told PTI on Wednesday.The couple got married in Indore on May 11 and travelled to the Northeast on May 20, reaching Meghalaya via Guwahati. They checked out of a homestay in Nongriat village on May 23 and then disappeared — prompting Raja’s family to raise an alert. Ten days later, on June 2, Raja’s body was found in a gorge near Weisawdong Falls in Sohra.The case has since unravelled as a premeditated murder allegedly orchestrated by Sonam in connivance with her boyfriend Raj Kushwaha and three hired contract killers. Sonam, who initially went missing after the murder, resurfaced in Ghazipur, Uttar Pradesh, and surrendered on June 9. Her boyfriend and the three hitmen — Vishal Singh Chauhan, Akash Rajput, and Anand Kurmi — were arrested soon after.According to investigators, Sonam pushed for the trip to Nongriat — a remote jungle area accessible only by trekking — hoping the murder would be easier to execute there. But the plan was delayed due to heavy tourist presence on May 22 and 23.“They ultimately killed Raja near Weisawdong Falls and dumped his body into a gorge,” said the officer.East Khasi Hills SP Vivek Syiem, who is leading the investigation, said the contract killers arrived in Guwahati on May 21, a day after the couple reached the Northeast. They bought a machete near their hotel before heading to Shillong by road.“Sonam stayed in touch with Raj throughout the day of the murder, while Raj coordinated with the three killers. She was present at the spot when Raja was killed,” said SP Syiem.After the murder, Sonam fled from Mawkdok to Shillong in a local taxi, then hired a tourist cab to Guwahati, from where she boarded multiple trains to avoid detection.“While she claims to have returned to Indore directly, we are still verifying this route,” the officer added.The Meghalaya Police SIT is now piecing together the full timeline of events and has already gathered CCTV evidence and mobile data to support the investigation.“We are also verifying Sonam’s claim that she had never been to Meghalaya before. The SIT is committed to filing a watertight chargesheet,” an officer said.All five accused — Sonam, Raj Kushwaha, and the three contract killers — have been produced before a court in Shillong and remain in police custody.","Raja Raghuvanshi from Indore was killed during his honeymoon in Meghalaya.

The US Army’s 250th anniversary celebration, which coincided with US president Donald Trump's birthday on Saturday, turned into a target of widespread online mockery after videos of the event surfaced on social media.The military parade faced heavy criticism for the poor coordination displayed by American troops. Footage from the event showed soldiers marching out of sync. Many social media users described the marching as sloppy and unprofessional, accusing the troops of deliberately showing defiance.“When military men and women in uniform march, they march with tight timing and in lockstep as a sign of pride. These soldiers couldn’t be further from marching in lockstep. It’s clear that they don’t want to be a part of Trump’s Dictator Parade — and are just phoning it in,” one user wrote.A US Army veteran wrote, “We learn this every day in basic training and when we go to AIT how to march, it’s an important part of training. There is no other reason for them to look like this other than defiance. Not to mention they did a practice run the day before.”Adding to it, a photo went viral showing Trump sitting with his eyes shut next to his wife, Melania, during the procession, appearing to doze off while the event continued.One user commented, “Trump is too busy sleeping at his failure of a birthday parade to care.”While the parade was taking place in the capital, thousands of Americans also participated in anti-Trump protests across hundreds of US cities and towns. Many called the protests energetic and passionate, in contrast to the parade, which some viewers described as dull and uninspiring.","The US Army's 250th anniversary celebration coincided with US president Donald Trump's birthday on Saturday.

The Middle East stands on the brink of wider conflict as Israel and Iran continued exchange of missile strikes early Monday, ignoring global calls for de-escalation.Israel’s most aggressive military campaign to date inside Iran has targeted key nuclear and energy sites, while Iran has responded with hundreds of missiles that breached Israeli defenses and caused mounting civilian casualties. The death toll has surged on both sides, with over 230 confirmed dead in Iran and at least 14 in Israel. Talks on Iran’s nuclear program with the US have been suspended, and both nations appear locked into a spiraling confrontation with regional and global repercussions.Israel's armed forces issued an alert on Monday about a fresh wave of missiles approaching from Iran, while AFP reporters documented powerful blasts in Jerusalem and fires near the coastal area of Haifa. ""A short while ago, the IDF identified missiles launched from Iran toward the territory of the State of Israel,"" the army posted on Telegram, using the acronym for its official name.The military stated that its aerial defence systems were actively working to counter the threat and instructed residents to seek shelter in protected areas until further instructions were provided.Powerful blasts echoed across Jerusalem in the early hours of Monday, as reported by an AFP journalist.The incident occurred moments after the Israeli military issued an alert about incoming missiles from Iran, instructing citizens to seek shelter and await further instructions.Iranian officials said Israeli airstrikes have killed 224 people and injured 1,277 since Friday, many of them civilians. Israel’s strikes hit the Iranian Defense Ministry, military factories, missile launch sites, and major energy facilities—including the South Pars gas field and the Shahran oil depot. Iranian state media reported massive fires and damage to residential buildings and government offices. The death toll is likely higher, with independent rights groups estimating over 400 killed.Iran launched a barrage of over 270 missiles at Israel, with 22 evading the country’s air defense systems. Strikes hit residential areas in Bat Yam, Tamra, and Rehovot, killing 14 and injuring nearly 390. A high-rise in Bat Yam was reduced to rubble, while an oil refinery in Haifa and the Weizmann Institute of Science also sustained damage. Air raid sirens rang out across Tel Aviv and Haifa as thousands rushed to shelters.Oil prices continued their upward trend on Monday as Israel and Iran exchanged missile strikes for the fourth consecutive day, with both nations threatening additional attacks, raising concerns about a prolonged conflict that could trigger inflationary pressures.The price of gold approached its historic peak due to increased demand for secure investments. Whilst equity markets experienced further declines, the losses remained contained due to optimism that the conflict would not expand across the Middle East region.Read: Missiles rained down as Israel & Iran tensions soared; what unfolded over the last 72 hours Investors focused on upcoming central bank meetings this week, particularly the US Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan sessions, alongside discussions with Washington regarding potential alternatives to Donald Trump's substantial tariffs.Israel's unexpected attack on Iranian military and nuclear facilities on Friday, which resulted in the deaths of senior commanders and scientists, caused crude prices to surge up to 13 percent, driven by concerns about regional supply disruptions.Experts cautioned that the price increase could trigger a global inflation resurgence, potentially undermining ongoing efforts by governments and central banks to maintain price stability, whilst raising concerns about impacts on already vulnerable economies. ""The knock-on impact of higher energy prices is that they will slow growth and cause headline inflation to rise,"" said Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG. Primary oil contracts increased by more than one percent during early Asian trading hours.A senior US official, quoted by AP, claimed that President Donald Trump intervened to stop an Israeli plan to assassinate Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The move, reportedly shelved due to fears of uncontrolled escalation, underscores how far Israel was prepared to go in its campaign against Iran’s leadership and nuclear infrastructure.Planned nuclear negotiations in Oman between the US and Iran were canceled after Israeli strikes on Iran’s Natanz and Isfahan nuclear sites. Satellite imagery and IAEA inspections confirmed major damage to key support buildings, including a uranium-conversion facility. While no radiation was released, officials said it could take months to restore operations. The attacks mark a major blow to Iran’s nuclear capacity and to diplomatic efforts.Panic spread in Tehran as Israeli missiles struck civilian districts and key infrastructure. Long queues formed at fuel stations and many attempted to flee the capital. In response, Iranian authorities began converting metro stations and mosques into shelters. Health officials reported that 90 per cent of the dead were civilians, while images of bloodied survivors and collapsed buildings circulated widely on state media.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggested that regime change in Iran could be a consequence of the conflict. He accused Tehran of seeking to transfer nuclear arms to Houthi rebels, though no evidence was offered. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi warned that Iranian retaliation would cease only if Israeli strikes stopped, signaling no immediate end to the hostilities.With Israel’s war against Hamas still ongoing in Gaza, the multi-front crisis risks plunging the entire region into chaos. Iran’s backing of Palestinian and Lebanese militant groups adds to fears of escalation beyond Israel and Iran. Despite international appeals for restraint, neither side has signaled willingness to step back, raising concerns that the conflict may soon draw in additional regional actors.Also read: 'Haven't slept in 3 days', fear grips Indian students in Iran; Israel escalates attack","Israel's armed forces issued an alert on Monday about a fresh wave of missiles approaching from Iran.

The Trump administration is planning a major expansion of its travel ban, which could soon cover citizens from 36 additional countries. Earlier this month, the Republican president issued an order blocking citizens from 12 countries from entering the United States.According to an internal US State Department cable seen by Reuters and first reported by the Washington Post, these nations risk being added to the list unless they address specific security concerns within 60 days.The cable, signed by US secretary of state Marco Rubio, lists various issues that have triggered these concerns. Among them are countries failing to issue reliable identity documents, having weak or uncooperative governments, poor passport security, and refusing to accept their citizens who have been ordered to leave the United States.Some countries were also flagged for their citizens' involvement in terrorism, antisemitic activities, or anti-American actions. However, the cable noted that not every concern applied to all countries listed.During Trump’s first term, he had already introduced a controversial travel ban on several Muslim-majority nations, a policy that faced multiple legal challenges before being upheld by the US Supreme Court in 2018.The 36 countries now at risk of facing either full or partial bans include:This would add to the ban announced earlier this month, which already restricts travel from 12 nations such as Afghanistan, Myanmar, Iran, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen. There are also partial restrictions on travellers from countries like Venezuela, Cuba, Laos, and Sierra Leone.","The 36 countries now at risk of facing either full or partial bans include:This would add to the ban announced earlier this month.

How are pizza orders linked to major geopolitical events







A Pentagon spokesperson reacted to the Pizza delivery index of June 13 when Israel launched military attacks in Iran and said they do not need to order pizza as there are many pizza options inside Pentagon and also they have sushi, sandwiches, donuts, etc. So, in a bizarre tracking, a surge in pizza orders around the Pentagon was noticed when the attack took place. ""Nearly all pizza establishments near the Pentagon have experienced a HUGE surge in activity,"" the X account of Pentagon Pizza Report said.The account's post included screenshots of Google data showing the popularity of pizza joints in Washington, D.C. Domino's, District Pizza Palace and We, the Pizza were all dramatically above what was typical for that time of the day.The Pentagon Pizza Report also said a gay bar close to the Pentagon had ""abnormally low traffic for a Thursday night"" as Israeli strikes were underway.The Pentagon Pizza Index, also known as the Pentagon Pizza Meter, is a quirky, unofficial theory suggesting that surges in pizza or takeout food orders to government buildings like the Pentagon, White House, or CIA can signal impending major geopolitical events or crises.The idea is that when government officials and staff work late into the night on urgent matters—such as military operations, coups, or international conflicts—they order quick, convenient food like pizza to sustain long hours in the office.The concept traces back to the Cold War, when Soviet intelligence reportedly monitored food delivery patterns to U.S. government buildings as a form of open-source intelligence (OSINT), dubbed “Pizzint” (Pizza Intelligence).According to The Guardian, deliveries of pizzas to the Pentagon doubled immediately before the 1989 US invasion of Panama and the 1991 Kuwait liberation campaign called Operation Desert Storm.The Takeout, a food and culture site, reported in January that while there are a number of eateries in the Pentagon—where almost 30,000 people work each day, according to Arlington National Cemetery Tours—it doesn't have its own pizzeria.Pentagon dismissed the spike reported this time and said they have plenty of pizza options inside and the timeline set out by the Pentagon Pizza Report did not align with the events, Newsweek reported.","Pentagon dismisses pizza index report of June 13 when Israel attacked Iran and said they don't need to order pizza from outside.

Netanyahu makes SHOCKING claim about Trump assassination attempts, his own





Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has claimed that Iran's Islamic regime sees US President Donald Trump as its biggest threat and even tried to assassinate him.Speaking to Fox News on Sunday, Netanyahu said, ""They want to kill him. He’s enemy number one.""Netanyahu also praised Trump for taking a tough stand against Iran's nuclear programme, rejecting previous agreements that allowed uranium enrichment and cancelling the nuclear deal. Netanyahu said Trump’s actions — including ordering the killing of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani — made him a key target for Tehran.""He took up this fake agreement and basically tore it up. He killed Qasem Soleimani. He made it very clear, including now, 'You cannot have a nuclear weapon, which means you cannot enrich uranium.' He's been very forceful, so for them, he's enemy number one,"" Fox News quoted Netanyahu as saying.The Israeli leader also revealed that his own life was targeted when a missile struck the bedroom window of his home. Calling himself Trump’s ""junior partner"" in confronting Iran, Netanyahu said both leaders have stood firm against Tehran's efforts to develop nuclear weapons.Describing the current situation, Netanyahu warned that Israel faced an ""imminent"" threat of nuclear destruction. He said Iran was moving fast to weaponise enriched uranium and expand its ballistic missile arsenal, producing thousands of missiles capable of striking Israeli cities. ""No country can sustain that, and certainly not a country the size of Israel, so we had to act,"" he said.Netanyahu defended Israel’s military campaign, Operation Rising Lion, calling it ""one of the greatest military operations in history."" He said the strikes have significantly set back Iran’s nuclear programme and dismissed the possibility of meaningful negotiations with Tehran.He also accused Iran's leaders of oppressing their people for 50 years while pursuing the destruction of Israel.","Netanyahu claims Iran's Islamic regime sees US President Donald Trump as its biggest threat and even tried to assassinate him.

Israel and Iran launched fresh attacks on each other on Sunday, killing scores of civilians and raising fears of a wider conflict, and US President Trump said it could be ended easily while warning Tehran not to strike any US targets.In Israel, rescue teams combed through rubble of residential buildings destroyed by Iranian missiles, using sniffer dogs and heavy excavators to look for survivors after at least 10 people, including children, were killed, raising the two-day toll to 13. Sirens rang out across the country after 4 pm on Sunday in the first such daylight alert, and fresh explosions could be heard in Tel Aviv. Israel said since Friday 390 people have been wounded. Iran has fired over 270 missiles, 22 of which got through the country's sophisticated multi-tiered air defences, according to Israeli figures. Israel's main international airport and airspace remained closed for a third day.In Iran, images from the capital showed the night sky lit up by a huge blaze at a fuel depot after Israel began strikes against Iran's oil and gas sector, raising the stakes for the global economy and the functioning of the Iranian state.Iran said Israel struck two oil refineries, raising the prospect of a broader assault. The Israeli military, in a social media post, warned Iranians to evacuate arms factories, signalling a further widening of the campaign. Explosions shook Tehran around noon and again around 3.30 pm.Israeli strikes targeted Iran's defence ministry early Sunday after hitting air defences, military bases and sites associated with its nuclear programme. Israel claimed it attacked an Iranian refuelling aircraft in Mashhad in the NE, calling it the farthest strike the military had yet carried out.

""Path to Tehran open,"" says Netanyahu

Escalation after deadly exchange

Global concerns over widening conflict





Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday issued his strongest warning yet to Iran, vowing to strike ""every target of the ayatollah regime"" and declaring that Israeli forces had already dealt a ""real blow"" to Tehran's nuclear infrastructure in an escalating military confrontation between the two regional arch-rivals.""We will hit every site, every target of the ayatollah regime,"" Netanyahu said in a video address, as Israel's air force continued its unprecedented campaign against Iranian military and nuclear facilities for a second consecutive day.Claiming Israel had opened a ""path to Tehran,"" Netanyahu warned that Iranian leaders should expect Israeli fighter jets in the skies over the capital ""very soon.""His remarks came shortly after the Israeli military announced it had struck 40 key targets in Tehran overnight, including ballistic missile sites and advanced air defence systems. The strikes were part of a broader Israeli offensive launched on Friday, which reportedly hit more than 200 Iranian military and nuclear sites, killing several high-ranking commanders, nuclear scientists, and government officials.""What they have felt so far is nothing compared to what they will feel under the force of our arm in the coming days,"" Netanyahu warned, calling Iran's nuclear ambitions and missile arsenal a ""dual threat"" to the State of Israel.The conflict erupted into open warfare following Israel's Friday assault on Iranian soil, a dramatic escalation in their shadow war that had largely played out through proxies and covert operations until now.Iran's response was swift. It launched waves of drones and ballistic missiles at Israeli cities, including Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. The retaliatory attack killed three people, injured more than 70 others, and caused damage in multiple locations, according to Israeli authorities.Iran's state media reported 78 people killed and over 320 injured in the first wave of Israeli strikes.The intensifying military confrontation has sparked global alarm, with regional and international powers urging both sides to de-escalate. However, both Israel and Iran appear determined to press ahead with their campaigns.","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vows to strike ""every target of the ayatollah regime"" Israeli military announced it had struck 40 key targets in Tehran overnight, including ballistic missile sites and advanced air defence systems.

Oman’s foreign minister Badr al-Busaidi announced on Saturday that the planned talks between Iran and the United States on Tehran’s fast-moving nuclear programme have been called off following Israel’s recent strikes on the West Asian country.Al-Busaidi, whose country has been acting as a mediator, confirmed the cancellation in a social media post, saying: ""The Iran-US talks scheduled to be held in Muscat this Sunday will not now take place. But diplomacy and dialogue remain the only pathway to lasting peace.""An Israeli drone struck and caused a ""strong explosion"" at an Iranian natural-gas processing plant, news agency Associated Press reported, citing semiofficial Iranian news agencies — the first Israeli attack on Iran’s oil and natural gas industry, if confirmed.The meeting in Muscat would have marked the sixth round of backchannel discussions, but Iran’s foreign minister had earlier called any negotiations ""unjustifiable"" amid the ongoing Israeli attacks.Israel carried out what it termed ""pre-emptive"" airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear infrastructure on Friday, citing an imminent threat. In a statement on X, the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) said: ""Iran is closer than ever to obtaining a nuclear weapon.Weapons of mass destruction in the hands of the Iranian regime are an existential threat to the State of Israel and to the wider world. The State of Israel has no choice but to fulfil the obligation to act in defence of its citizens and will continue to do so everywhere it is required to do so.

Trying to shake the regime







""The time has come for the Iranian people to unite around its flag and its historic legacy, by standing up for your freedom from the evil and oppressive regime,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Friday in a video statement after Israel struck over 200 military and nuclear sites in Iran.The unannounced strikes were clearly meant to disrupt Tehran's nuclear work and increase the time it would take for Iran to produce a nuclear weapon.However, the number of sites hit, the specific nature of the targets, and remarks from Israeli leaders suggest there may be a wider aim: weakening or even removing Iran’s ruling regime.""As we achieve our objective, we are also clearing the path for you to achieve your freedom,"" Netanyahu said, referring to Israeli strikes that hit targets across Iran, including nuclear sites, killing several top military commanders and nuclear scientists.The attacks early Friday went beyond nuclear plants and missile sites. They also targeted senior members of Iran’s military and nuclear experts — moves that, according to a Reuters report, seem designed to damage Iran’s image internally and among its partners in the region. These are actions that could affect the stability of Iran’s leadership.There is already significant dissatisfaction among many people in Iran due to economic struggles, lack of free expression, and ongoing issues related to women’s and minority rights.In this situation, Netanyahu may be hoping that the extensive airstrikes will lead to unrest within the country that could eventually bring down the Islamic Republic.Some officials in Israel and the United States see the nuclear programme as the main security concern. From that view, Iran should be offered incentives: if it stops pursuing nuclear weapons and ends its support for armed groups, it could have sanctions removed and be reintegrated into the global system.Others believe the real issue is the continued existence of the Islamic Republic. They argue that Iran’s leadership is unlikely to change its regional behaviour and is working not to deter Israel, but to destroy it. From this perspective, diplomatic talks only help Iran buy time. A nuclear programme seen as illegal gives cover to maintain sanctions, which they hope will eventually weaken a regime they consider beyond repair.There is no common ground between these two positions. And now, more clearly than before, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appears to be in the second group. The recent strikes were not mainly focused on nuclear equipment but on top military commanders of the Islamic Republic. The goal, it seems, is not just to set back Iran’s nuclear efforts — but to challenge the regime’s hold on power, Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, wrote in an article in Foreign Policy.Israel might believe that the recent attacks and killings could destabilize the Iranian government and create an opportunity for a public uprising.This is what Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is hoping for. But this approach is risky.Even with the damage caused by Israel’s recent attack, there is long-standing hostility toward Israel — not just from Iran’s leadership but also from much of its mostly Shi’ite population. That makes it uncertain whether public anger alone could bring down a well-established religious government that has the support of strong security forces.There is no sign that such a series of events will even begin. And even if it does, there’s no clarity on what direction it would take, a BBC report said.Power in Iran lies mostly with those who control the military and the economy. Much of this power rests with hardliners in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and other unelected groups.These groups don’t need to carry out a coup — they already have authority. And they could choose to make Iran more confrontational in response to attacks.Another possible result could be the collapse of the current government, followed by instability in Iran.With a population of nearly 90 million, any unrest in Iran would affect many countries in the Middle East.If Israel is able to remove the Islamic leadership in Tehran, the attack would be seen as successful. But if the leadership stays in place — and history suggests that airstrikes alone rarely bring regime change — then Iran could still keep some part of its nuclear program, Jeffrey Lewis writes.Israel’s national security advisor has already said that Iran might still keep parts of its nuclear capability. So what happens then?One possibility Israel sees is that Iran could agree to a deal with US President Donald Trump to give up its nuclear plans. But another possibility is that Iran could follow North Korea’s path — leaving the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and eventually developing nuclear weapons. In that case, it is unlikely that Russia or China would support new sanctions. They may not even enforce the ones already in place. Russia has been buying Iranian drones, and China imports Iranian oil.The reasons why Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei stopped the country’s nuclear weapons program in 2003 — and why he kept that policy — are not fully known. There have been different views within Iran: some have wanted a nuclear weapon, while others have not. Until now, those opposing the bomb have been able to influence policy. But after this recent strike, these discussions will likely change. There will also be new individuals involved in these decisions. People will think about those who are no longer there and ask whether Israel would have acted this way if Iran already had nuclear weapons — or if Israel didn’t have them.If the Iranian government doesn’t fall, Israel might feel the need to carry out more attacks in the future. Even if this strike has seriously disrupted Iran’s nuclear efforts, Iran could restart the program.""In the ideal world, Israel would prefer to see a change of regime, no question about that,"" Sima Shine, a former chief Mossad analyst and now a researcher at Israel's Institute for National Security Studies, was quoted as saying by the news agency Reuters.If Israel succeeds in removing Iran's leadership, there is no guarantee the successor that emerges would not be even more hardline in pursuit of conflict with Israel.""For years, many in Israel have insisted that regime change in Iran would prompt a new and better day - that nothing could be worse than the current theocratic regime,"" Jonathan Panikoff, a former US deputy national intelligence officer for the Middle East was quoted as saying by Reuters. ""But history tells us it can always be worse.""","Israel may be hoping that the extensive airstrikes will lead to unrest within the country that could eventually bring down the Islamic Republic. The goal, it seems, is not just to set back Iran’s nuclear efforts — but to challenge the regime's hold on power. Some officials in Israel and the United States see the nuclear programme as the main security concern.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121850713,imgsize-1199755,width-400,resizemode-4/121850713.jpg"

As per Iranian authorities, the strike left 78 dead and over 300 injured.In response, Iran launched a barrage of ballistic missiles at Israeli cities late Friday and into early Saturday. Loud explosions were heard across Tel Aviv and Jerusalem as air raid sirens wailed. Residents were urged to take cover, while Iran’s military warned ominously that “everyone will feel it.”The latest strikes followed a fiery pledge from Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who vowed retaliation for what he called Israel’s “aggression.” His comments came just hours before Iranian missiles lit up the night skies, signalling a dangerous new phase in the already volatile conflict.","Israel claims to have killed over 20 military officials, including the Iranian army and Revolutionary Guards commanders.

NEW DELHI: India on Saturday distanced itself from a statement issued by the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) condemning recent Israeli strikes on Iran, clarifying that it did not participate in the discussions that led to the group's remarks.In a statement, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) said, “The Shanghai Cooperation Organization has issued a statement on recent developments between Israel and Iran. India did not participate in the discussions on the above-mentioned SCO statement.”The MEA reaffirmed India's independent stance on the Israel-Iran tensions, first articulated on June 13, and reiterated its call for calm and dialogue. “We urge that channels of dialogue and diplomacy be utilised to work towards de-escalation. It is essential that the international community undertake endeavours in that direction,” the statement read.External affairs minister S Jaishankar also conveyed India’s concerns directly to his Iranian counterpart during a recent conversation. According to the MEA, Jaishankar highlighted the international community's deep concern over the rising tensions and emphasized the need to avoid further escalation and return to diplomatic engagement.The SCO statement had strongly denounced Israel’s strikes on Iranian territory, describing them as “aggressive actions against civilian targets, including energy and transport infrastructure,” which it said caused civilian casualties and violated international law and the UN Charter. It also reaffirmed support for resolving tensions around Iran’s nuclear program through peaceful and diplomatic means and expressed condolences to the Iranian people and government.India, however, reiterated its independent stance, first stated on June 13, which emphasized restraint, dialogue, and diplomacy. “India urges both sides to avoid any escalatory steps. Existing channels of dialogue and diplomacy should be utilised to work towards a de-escalation of the situation and resolving underlying issues,” the earlier MEA statement had said.The ministry added that Jaishankar had recently spoken with his Iranian counterpart, conveying the deep concern of the international community and reiterating the need to avoid further escalation and return to diplomatic processes.India emphasized its “close and friendly relations with both countries” and reaffirmed its readiness to extend support towards efforts for peace.

Iran launched a powerful retaliatory strike late Friday night, targeting one of Israel's most heavily guarded military sites, the Kirya compound in Tel Aviv, following Israel's Operation Rising Lion, which targeted Iran's nuclear facility at Natanz.The Kirya, often referred to as Israel's version of the Pentagon, houses the Israel Defence Forces' (IDF) general staff, the ministry of defence, and critical military command and intelligence units.It also includes Camp Rabin, named after former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, and is considered vital for Israel’s national security operations.According to reports, Iran fired a barrage of missiles at the Tel Aviv-based military complex, striking deep into Israel's defence infrastructure.Israel's well-known Iron Dome air defence system failed to stop the targeted attack launched by the Khamenei-led Islamic Republic.Also read: ‘Talks with US meaningless’: Iran rules out nuclear talks; Tehran blames US for backing Israel The New York Times verified alarming social media footage showing a missile slamming into the area, causing what was described as ""significant damage.""""This is Israel’s version of the Pentagon, the Kiryat, and the building on this compound was just hit,"" Fox News reported.""There is significant damage.""The dramatic videos showed Israel’s air defence systems firing interceptors into the night sky moments before a large explosion lit up central Tel Aviv. One of the warheads appears to have penetrated Israel’s defences and struck a sensitive command site.Fox News correspondent on the ground described the incoming attack as a ""massive amount"" of Iranian ballistic missiles, forcing them to take cover during the live report.""These ballistic missiles make the rockets that were being fired from Gaza look like toys,"" the correspondent said, adding that Iran used around 150 ballistic missiles to hit residential areas and military facilities in and around Tel Aviv.The IDF has not officially confirmed that its headquarters were struck but released footage showing Iran firing waves of ballistic missiles into Israeli territory.""The IDF cannot, and will not, allow Iran to attack our civilians,"" the military said in a post on X.Iran's targeting of the Kirya marks a major escalation in the ongoing conflict, as the site is one of the most sensitive and strategically important in the country, coordinating military planning, intelligence, and operational command.","Iran launched a powerful retaliatory strike late Friday night, targeting one of Israel's most heavily guarded military sites.

Poll Should international bodies play a more active role in de-escalating regional military conflicts? Yes, stronger global intervention is needed. No, such matters should be handled internally.





In a bid to fill the military vacuum left by Israel’s fatal strikes that killed several top Iranian commanders, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Saturday appointed Major General Amir Hatami as the new Chief Commander of the Army of the Islamic Republic of Iran.The announcement, reported by Iranian state media outlet IRNA, marks a significant leadership change as Tehran seeks to stabilise its military structure after Israel’s large-scale offensive.Hatami, who served as Iran's Defence Minister from 2013 to 2021, now steps into a critical role at a time of heightened regional tensions.In his official decree, Khamenei commended Hatami's ""dedication, competence, and experience,"" urging him to lead with a ""transformative and revolutionary approach,"" according to IRNA.Khamenei also expressed gratitude to Major General Seyyed Abdolrahim Mousavi for his ""sincere and valuable efforts"" during his tenure.The reshuffle follows the killing of Iran's former Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces (CSAF) General Mohammad Hossein Bagheri, who, according to Iranian authorities, was assassinated ""at the hands of the evil Zionist regime."" Khamenei later appointed Mousavi as Bagheri’s successor.“In view of the martyrdom of Lieutenant General Mohammad Hossein Bagheri at the hands of the evil Zionist regime, & in light of Major General Sayyid Abdolrahim Mousavi's meritorious services & valuable experience, I appoint him as Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces,” Khamenei posted on X.Khamenei also made sweeping changes across other key military branches, replacing top officials killed in Israel’s Operation Rising Lion airstrikes.Major General Mohammad Pakpour has been named the new Commander-in-Chief of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) after the death of Lieutenant General Hossein Salami in the Israeli strikes.“In view of the martyrdom of Lieutenant General Hossein Salami at the hands of the vile Zionist regime, and in light of Major General Mohammad Pakpour's meritorious services and valuable experience, I appoint him as Commander-in-Chief of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps,” Khamenei announced.Further, Major General Ali Shadmani was appointed Commander of the Khatam al-Anbiya (pbuh) Central Headquarters, following the assassination of Lieutenant General Gholamali Rashid. Khamenei posted, “In view of Lt. Gen. Gholamali Rashid's martyrdom at the hands of the vile Zionist regime, and in light of Major General Ali Shadmani's meritorious services & valuable experience, I confer the rank of Major Gen. & appoint him Commander of the Khatam al-Anbiya (pbuh) Central HQ. ”According to a CNN report, Israel’s Operation Rising Lion dealt a devastating blow to Iran’s top military leadership, killing high-ranking officers, including the heads of the IRGC, the air force, and a former national security chief.Among the key figures killed was Major General Hossein Salami, the powerful commander of the IRGC who had led the elite force since 2019. Salami played a pivotal role in Iran’s military offensives, including direct missile and drone attacks on Israel in April and October 2024.CNN further reported that Major General Mohammad Bagheri, the former Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, was another significant casualty. Bagheri was instrumental in military coordination, foreign policy engagements in Syria, and diplomatic talks with Saudi Arabia.Ali Shamkhani, a long-time aide to Khamenei and former national security chief, also died in the Israeli strike. Shamkhani had recently been involved in Iran’s diplomatic overtures, including China-brokered talks with Saudi Arabia.Also read: Explainer: How Iran's nuclear progress triggered Israeli strike - and why it matters Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the commander of the IRGC’s air force and the strategist behind Iran’s 2020 missile attacks on Israel and US military bases in Iraq, was also killed.

Weapons of mass destruction in the hands of the Iranian regime are an existential threat to the State of Israel and the wider world. The State of Israel has no choice but to fulfil the obligation to act in defence of its citizens and will continue to do so everywhere it is required to do so,"" the IDF posted on X.In response, Iran launched a wave of drone and missile strikes on Tel Aviv.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on Friday confirmed that Israeli airstrikes on Iran’s Natanz nuclear site caused internal radiological and chemical contamination.However, radiation levels outside the facility remain normal and do not pose a threat to the public or environment, said IAEA director general Rafael Grossi in his statement to the UN security council.""However, due to the impacts, there is radiological and chemical contamination inside the facilities in Natanz. The type of radiation present inside the facility, primarily alpha particles, is manageable with appropriate radiation protection measures,"" he said in his statement.Grossi revealed that the Israeli strikes destroyed the above-ground section of the Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant, which was enriching uranium up to 60 per cent U-235. The attack also damaged electrical infrastructure, including both main and emergency power systems.Although the underground cascade hall appears undamaged, the loss of power may have affected the centrifuges inside.Iran informed the agency that only the Natanz site was directly hit, which includes the Fuel Enrichment Plant and the Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant.However, Iran also reported nearby attacks at the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant and the Esfahan complex, which houses several other nuclear facilities.The IAEA is in constant contact with Iran’s Nuclear Regulatory Authority to monitor the situation and assess the damage, said Grossi. A special task force has been established to monitor developments and update the UN Security Council as needed.Grossi expressed deep concern over the Israeli attack, reiterating that “nuclear facilities must never be attacked, regardless of the context or circumstances.”Following the strikes, Israel said that Iran was closer than ever to developing a nuclear weapon and described the attack as a necessary act of defence. Iran responded with missile strikes on Tel Aviv, prompting further Israeli counterstrikes.",IAEA confirms Israeli airstrikes on Iran's Natanz nuclear site caused internal radiological and chemical contamination.

IDF post on X

Poll Do you think diplomatic efforts can help reduce conflicts between countries? Yes, diplomacy is key to peace No, conflicts often escalate despite talks





The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) on Saturday apologised to Indians on X for sharing a post that depicted an incorrect map of India.The IDF acknowledged the mistake and clarified that the post was intended as an illustration of the region.“This map fails to precisely depict borders. We apologise for any offense caused by this image,” the IDF wrote on X.The image, shared with the caption, “Iran is a global threat. Israel is not the end goal, it’s only the beginning. We had no other choice but to act,” visually illustrated the range of Iran’s missiles. The map placed Iran at the centre, with concentric circles marking missile ranges of 300 km, 500 km, 800 km, 1,300 km, and 2,000 km, extending the threat to countries across the Middle East, North Africa, South Asia, and parts of Europe and Asia.The graphic was intended to emphasise that Iran’s missile capabilities are not just a threat to Israel but pose a wider regional and potentially global danger.However, a major flaw in the image was the incorrect depiction of India’s map. The map omitted Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh, which are constitutionally integral parts of India. Aksai Chin, which is part of Ladakh, was also excluded from Indian territory. Arunachal Pradesh was also misrepresented in the map.Tensions in the Middle East escalated sharply overnight as Iran launched missile strikes toward Israel late Friday and into early Saturday, in retaliation for Israel’s Operation ""Rising Lion.""The confrontation erupted after what Israeli officials described as the country’s ""greatest military operations in history"" against Iran. On Thursday night, Israel carried out a large-scale, meticulously planned offensive involving warplanes and drones, some of which were reportedly smuggled into Iran in advance.Also read: Iran-Israel war: Iran airspace shut, international flights from India to take longer

Iran Missile Strike Near Tel Aviv Causes Casualties; 2 Killed, Over A Dozen Injured In Central Israel

Point of no return: Army chief





JERUSALEM: Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu Friday said the attacks were authorised over six months ago, in November 2024, and was initially scheduled for April 2025, but were postponed due to operational considerations. In a recorded speech in Hebrew, Netanyahu provided updates about the operation to citizens. A visibly elated Netanyahu said he will try to make such statements daily.""This didn't happen by chance or for trivial reasons - if Iran has nuclear weapons, we simply won't be here,"" he said. Netanyahu said that following the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, Israel made an assessment that Iran would expedite its nuclear programme, which it did. Earlier on Friday morning, in a video message, he said Iran has reached a level of uranium enrichment that it could soon develop some nine atom bombs. He also cautioned citizens not to be in euphoria over the success of the operation and stay calm and vigilant. He asserted that there would be retaliation and may be ""a price"" to pay.Israel's chief of staff lieutenant general Eyal Zamir, said the offensive was launched ""because the time had come; we'd reached the point of no return"". ""We cannot wait for another time to act, we have no choice,"" Zamir said. ""History has taught us... to fight to preserve our existence"".","Israel's chief of staff lieutenant general Eyal Zamir, said the offensive was launched ""because the time had come; we'd reached the point of no return"".

The last time Israel and Iran traded attacks, Israel received strong support from many allies. Britain and the US provided backup in the form of fighter jets, refuelling planes and air defence systems. Neighbouring Jordan confirmed it had shot down Iranian missiles and drones. Some West Asian states allowed Israel to transit their airspace.This time around, there was less understanding and more concern. Some European allies worried Israel was ratcheting up a conflict with Iran after eight months of simmering tensions but no overt warfare. ""Escalation serves no one in the region,"" PM Keir Starmer of Britain said, while EU's chief diplomat, Kaja Kallas, called the situation ""dangerous"". Those remarks followed a growing chorus of European condemnation of Israel over the past few months for escalating the war in Gaza. Some of the sharpest condemnation came from countries in the region. Egypt, which has a longstanding peace treaty with Israel, called the strikes ""a direct threat to regional and international peace and security"".Still, a number of key allies, including the US, stood behind Israel and expressed mounting frustration with Iran's advancing nuclear programme. And should Iran launch a powerful counterattack against Israel, allies could still come to the country's defence militarily.","Last time Israel and Iran traded attacks, Israel received strong support from many allies.
