NEW DELHI: After two nursery students, four-year-old girls, were sexually abused by the sweeper of a reputed school in Thane district, protests erupted at Badlapur railway station on Tuesday where local trains were stopped and agitators blocked the tracks.Read more: Maharashtra Kids Sex Abuse Live Updates: CPRO Central Railway said, ""Local trains stopped at Badlapur railway station where protesters agitated against the alleged sexual assault incident with two minor girls at a school in Badlapur.""More than four hours have passed since the protesters descended on tracks but police and authorities are unable to convince protesters who refused to heed pleas for the withdrawal of the blockade.A call for Badlapur bandh has been given by several organisations to protest against the incident.Residents in Badlapur protested against the sexual abuse of two minor girls which occurred last week. Local train movement has been affected as protests are underway at Badlapur Station. Police have arrested a person in the case. The parents came to know about the incident on August 18 and filed anFIR .Two four-year-old nursery students were allegedly sexually abused by a newly hired sweeper at an English medium school in Thane district. The 24-year-old accused was arrested on Saturday, but the parents of the victims expressed their dissatisfaction with the police's handling of the case. They claimed that the FIR was registered more than 12 hours after the complaint was lodged, and only after the intervention of the District Women and Child Welfare Department.The school administration on Monday suspended the principal, class teacher , and female attendant, holding them responsible for the incident.The school administration has also come under scrutiny for allowing a male sweeper, who was hired on August 1, to accompany the young girls to the washroom. The incident came to light when one of the girls confided in her grandfather about the sexual abuse by the school staff member when he would take her and her friend to the washroom. The family then discussed the matter with the other girl's parents, who revealed that their daughter had recently become afraid to go to school.The families took the four-year-olds for a medical check-up with a private doctor, who confirmed that the girls had been sexually abused. They then approached a local MNS leader who accompanied them to the police station on Friday at 12.30 pm. However, instead of promptly recording the parents' statements and registering an FIR, the police station in-charge, Shubhada Shitole, allegedly made them wait for hours, stating that they needed to verify the claim first. Sources claimed that a police team visited the school but were informed that the CCTV cameras had not been functioning for the past few days.It was only after the District Women and Child Welfare Department intervened, police registered a case under the Pocso Act past midnight. On Saturday morning, police also got the girls’ medical examination conducted at a govt hospital as a private medical test is not valid in court.The police station incharge, Subhada Shitole, has been transferred to the special branch by Thane police for delaying the registration of the FIR when the parents of the child approached the police station.Locals said that along with citizens, rickshaw union, traders’ union, jewellers association, and now some political parties have also come forward to join the bandh. The accused, who was hired by the school on August 1, will remain in police remand until August 21.Rajya Sabha MP from UBT Sena, Priyanka Chaturvedi expressed her deep concern and condemned the incident.""Two young girls were sexually assaulted in Badlapur, Maharashtra in the school premises; the entire state is outraged and seeks justice. I once again urge the President to approve the Maharashtra Shakti Criminal Law, so that no other child or woman faces this travesty. Shame on the state government to continue to ignore the safety of women,"" she posted on X.Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray demanded a fast-track trial and speedy justice in the case of sexual abuse of two girls at a school in Thane district. Talking to reporters, Thackeray said on one hand, the Mahayuti government is running the Mukhyamantri Ladki Bahin scheme for women, but daughters of sisters are not safe.In an apparent reference to the rape and murder of a doctor in Kolkata, where the Mamata Banerjee-led government has come under fire, the Sena (UBT) chief said politics was being done over crime against women by targeting certain states.The former chief minister claimed the school where the girls were allegedly sexually abused was linked to BJP leaders. ""The case should be fast-tracked, and the victims should be ensured speedy justice,"" he said.Leaders of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) parties like Congress, Nationalist Congress Party (SP) and Shiv Sena (UBT), besides Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, attacked the government on the incident in the home district of chief minister Eknath Shinde.Nationalist Congress Party (SP) working president Supriya Sule said the incident is “very shocking and serious” and the state home department must take note of the citizens’ anger.“Citizens are demanding strict action against the murderer who committed this heinous act. The anger of the citizens is very right and the home department needs to take note of their anger,” urged Sule.She called upon the Thane Police to thoroughly investigate the (accused) person and take strict action against him.“Apart from this, a case should also be registered against the management of the institution who tried to suppress this matter,” demanded Sule.Congress leader of the opposition in the assembly, Vijay Wadettiwar called up Thane Police Commissioner Ashutosh Dumbare and demanded the suspension of the woman police official who reportedly made the victim’s parents sit in the police station for nearly 12 hours before taking their complaint last week.“This case must be taken up by a fast track court to hear it in three months and the accused must be given the death sentence,” said Wadettiwar.Congress MP and Mumbai president Varsha Gaikwad said, “The incident of inhumane and cruel treatment of the girls is mind-numbing”, and the issue of women’s safety has become very serious during the Shinde government, while its silence was unbearable.“The number of crimes against women is also increasing, but the state Home Minister and the government are not at all concerned. It is not enough to simply say 'Ladaki Baheen' and sit with rakhi in hand. If the government wants to preserve the true relationship with the sisters, it also has to fulfil the responsibility of keeping them safe as a true brother,” pointed out Gaikwad.SS (UBT)’s Deputy Leader Sushma Andhare questioned why schools without CCTVs and ‘sevikas’ (women assistants) were given permission and said “Ladki Bahin can wait, we need ‘Surakshit Bahin’ (secure sister) first”.Claiming that there is a complete collapse of law and order in the state, SS (UBT)’s spokesperson Kishore Tiwari demanded the immediate sacking of deputy CM Fadnavis and forming an SIT to probe the shocking case.“The law and order does not exist due to corruption and cash deals to get desired police postings… The CM is like a rubber stamp as there's a complete collapse of law and order due to hostile corruption and cash and getting the desired posting. The BJP is responsible for the present messy situation,” said Tiwari.Demanding the resignation of both the CM and deputy CM, VBA Chief Spokesperson Siddharth Mokle said the incident is a blot on humanity but the government is only obsessed about winning the next elections at all costs.The Maharashtra government on Tuesday ordered the setting up of a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the alleged sexual abuse of two girl students of a school in Badlapur. The SIT will be headed by Inspector General of Police-rank officer Aarti Singh, deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, who heads the home department, stated on X.Fadnavis stated he has directed the Thane Police Commissioner to prepare a proposal to try the case in a fast-track court.Maharashtra government ordered the suspension of three police officials, including a senior inspector, for alleged dereliction of duty in the investigation of the sexual abuse of two girls at a school in Badlapur, amid widespread protests.""The orders of immediate suspension of the senior police inspector, assistant sub-inspector and head constable attached to Badlapur police station for the dereliction of duty have been issued,"" deputy chief minister and home minister Devendra Fadnavis posted on X.Fadnavis said the state government has appointed Arti Singh, an inspector general-rank Indian Police Service (IPS) officer, to conduct the inquiry.""It will be our endeavour to inquire into the incident at the earliest. We want to file the chargesheet in this case as soon as possible and place the matter before a fast-track court for hearing,"" he said.""Our police department will make complete efforts to get such a barbaric and inhuman act punished immediately,"" the deputy chief minister added.He slammed the Nationalist Congress Party's (NCP) working president, Supriya Sule, and former Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray for allegedly politicising the issue.""It is unfortunate that the opposition seeks to gain political benefit out of such incidents. The opposition is devoid of any empathy. The politics of the opposition is coming to the fore,"" the senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader said.He said Thackeray should behave like a statesman and not stoop too low and indulge in politics on a sensitive issue of sexual abuse.Meanwhile, Maharashtra chief minister Eknath Shinde has directed the police to invoke the attempt to rape charge against the arrested accused. The case will be fast-tracked and a special public prosecutor will be appointed, Shinde said on Tuesday.""I have spoken to the Thane Commissioner of Police. The accused has been arrested. I have asked the case to be fast-tracked and book the accused under the charges of attempt to rape and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act,"" he said.The chief minister warned of legal action if the management of the school is found negligent or complicit, the chief minister's office (CMO) stated.During a meeting with education minister Deepak Kesarkar, Shinde proposed several measures aimed at improving school safety and preventing future abuse like the installation of complaint boxes in every school, enhancing scrutiny of school staff who frequently interact with students, including the background checks, and establishing safe reporting mechanisms for students.Shinde appealed to demonstrating parents to exercise restraint as the rail blockade was hampering the functioning of local trains.Maharashtra education minister Deepak Kesarkar said, ""We will see to it that the existing safety measures are further strengthened. We are issuing a circular today that CCTVs must be operational in each school. We will appoint a committee based on the Vishaka committee in schools as well. We will fast-track this case and give the strictest punishment to the accused. The school principal, the class teacher and 2 assistants have been suspended. The school also has been served a notice. A woman senior PI who delayed registering a case has been transferred but she should be suspended.""""This is a very sad incident. The entire machinery of the state education department has been mobilized. We have given instructions to four IAS officers from Pune and Mumbai. We are investigating why the CCTV was not functioning in the school. After the complaint was lodged, no action was taken, so the Senior PI has been transferred. We will bring this case to a Fast Track court and ensure the maximum punishment for the accused. Our entire department is present here, and the safety of students is our priority,"" he added.Meanwhile, a BJP MLA from the Murbad assembly constituency in Thane district, Kisan Kathore, alleged the protest at Badlapur railway station is politically motivated. He claimed agitators have come from neighbouring areas and not from Badlapur.""These demonstrators are not from Badlapur city; they have arrived from neighbouring areas such as Ulhasnagar. A comprehensive investigation is conducted against the school principal and staff members who allegedly attempted to suppress the incident,"" Kathore said.He alleged some individuals associated with political parties had put up banners in Badlapur rejecting the funds offered under the ""Mukhyamantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana"", but are now seeking justice. ""The protesters at Badlapur station are not locals. They are residents of neighbouring areas,"" he added.The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) on Tuesday demanded a detailed report from Maharashtra authorities on the incident of alleged sexual assault on two four-year-old girls in a school washroom in Thane district and the ""delay"" in filing an FIR in the matter. The Commission took suo motu cognisance of the case on a day thousands of protesters blocked railway tracks at Badlapur station in Thane and stormed the local school building, where the alleged incident had occurred.The accused, who was employed to clean the girls' toilets, is alleged to have victimised the children on August 12-13, 2024.The NHRC has issued notices to the chief secretary and the Director General of Police of Maharashtra, demanding a detailed report on the incident within two weeks.The Commission's directive calls for clarity on the reasons behind the reported ""12-hour delay"" in registering the First Information Report (FIR) after the parents lodged a complaint with the police.Parents of the victims have raised concerns over why a female staff member was not assigned to clean the girls' washroom, a standard practice that could have potentially prevented such an incident.The Commission has emphasised the need to investigate this aspect thoroughly.In addition to the status of the FIR, the NHRC has requested details about the health and well-being of the two victims, including whether they have received any counselling or support services from the authorities or the school management.The NHRC has also asked for information on the measures being taken or proposed to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future.The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) will dispatch a team to Thane in Maharashtra following the alleged sexual assault of a four-year-old girl in a school in the district. The apex child rights body has also questioned the delay in the registration of an FIR in the matter. The incident has sparked outrage, particularly due to a reported delay by the local police in lodging the First Information Report (FIR).NCPCR Chairperson Priyank Kanoongo took to social media to express his distress over the incident and announced that a team would be dispatched to investigate the matter.He questioned why police made the victim's parents wait for 12 hours to get an FIR lodged.""I will personally monitor the investigation, and ensure that all negligent police officers are punished,"" Kanoongo said in a post on X.A woman journalist covering the protest over the Badlapur sexual abuse incident alleged on Tuesday that a local leader of the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena made an offensive remark, saying she was acting 'as if she herself had been raped.'Waman Mhatre, former mayor of Badlapur who belongs to the party led by the Maharashtra chief minister, however, claimed that his remark was misconstrued.The woman journalist, who works for a Marathi daily, told a news channel that as she was covering the protests on the tracks, Mhatre confronted her, making 'vulgar' gestures. She was reporting on the incident in such a way 'as if she herself had been raped,' she quoted Mhatre as saying.""Such behavior was highly unacceptable and caused me agony. However, I responded by asserting that my reporting is based on facts,"" the woman added.Mhatre claimed that his comments were misconstrued. ""I was insisting that they provide factual information to the protesters. The word 'rape' was consistently used. I was asking them to get factual information, but it was misconstrued,"" he said.The Mumbai Press Club condemned Mhatre's statements and demanded that chief minister Shinde take action against him. Mhatre ""demonstrated blatant disregard for public sentiment by blaming journalists for the incident"" and asserted that the media was inciting unrest, the Press Club said in a statement.","Two four-year-old nursery students were allegedly sexually abused by a newly hired sweeper at an English medium school in Thane district. Parents of the victims expressed their dissatisfaction with the police's handling of the case. Local train movement has been affected as protests are underway at Badlapur Station.

In a dramatic scene that unfolded, Trump halted his speech to address the crowd after an attendee appeared to need immediate help.The event, which was Trump’s first outdoor rally since a shooting incident at his Pennsylvania campaign stop last month, took a tense turn when the former president noticed a commotion in the crowd.“What’s wrong?” Trump asked, his voice laced with concern, before amplifying his plea into the microphone: “A doctor, please!”As the sweltering heat bore down on the crowd—many of whom had waited for days to attend—Trump, visibly empathetic, turned his attention to the area where the attendee was being assisted. “It is very hot here,” he noted, acknowledging the challenging conditions. “Take your time, doctor, take your time, thank you!”In a show of solidarity, Trump joined the crowd in applause before stepping away from his bulletproof podium, flanked by Secret Service agents. He approached the area where the individual was receiving aid, offering a hug and words of reassurance before returning to the podium amid chants of “We love Trump.”Newsweek quoted the Secret Service saying that the incident was heat-related and that the individual received prompt care from EMTs. The spokesperson assured that the attendee was “fine” following the incident.This episode follows a recent tragic event at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, where a 20-year-old gunman opened fire, resulting in one fatality and injuries to Trump and others.

"Shyamala Gopalan: In Kamala Harris’ story, her mother Shyamala Gopalan steals the show - 'Star of my life'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-elections-2024-in-kamala-harris-story-her-mother-steals-the-show-star-of-my-life/articleshow/112724376.cms,"The Truths We Hold

Kamala Harris , the Vice President of the United States, often reflects on the profound influence her mother , Shyamala Gopalan , had on her life and career. In her 2019 memoir,, Harris wrote, “Mommy, you are the star of this book because you are the reason for everything. There is no title or honor on earth I’ll treasure more than to say I am Shyamala Gopalan Harris’ daughter.”Gopalan, a prominent breast cancer researcher, passed away in 2009 at the age of 70.As per the report by the USA Today, despite her absence during Harris' rise to the vice presidency, her presence continues to be felt. “I think of her all the time,” Harris wrote. “Sometimes I look up and talk to her.”Born in 1938 in India, Gopalan was ahead of her time. At just 19, she defied cultural norms by pursuing a Ph.D in nutrition and endocrinology at the University of California, Berkeley. Her decision to move to the US was a bold one, especially for a young woman from a conservative Tamil Brahmin community. Gopalan’s determination to excel academically and professionally set a powerful example for her daughters.In a memorable anecdote from her memoir, Harris recounted a conversation with her mother during her campaign for California Attorney General. Despite being seriously ill with cancer, Gopalan’s response to Harris’ concerns was filled with unwavering support. “Mommy, these guys are saying they’re gonna kick my ass,” Harris told her. Gopalan, lying on her side, rolled over, smiled, and said nothing—knowing her daughter’s fighting spirit would prevail. “She knew who she had raised,” Harris reflected. “She knew her fighting spirit was alive and well inside me.”Gopalan’s legacy of resilience and social justice profoundly shaped Harris’ worldview. Harris often recalls her mother’s lessons, including the importance of not letting any situation get the better of you and the need to mentor others. Harris also highlighted her mother's advice on self-determination: “Don’t you let anyone tell you who you are. You tell them who you are.”Shyamala Gopalan’s impact extended beyond her daughters. Earlier this year, Indian American Impact, a voting rights and advocacy group, created the Dr. Shyamala Gopalan Harris Award for Allyship and Civil Rights in her honor. “Her legacy is a reminder that the immigrant experience is not just about personal achievement. It’s also about public service. It’s about giving back to the community, and building a path for future generations,” said Deepak Raj, co-founder of the organization.As Harris prepares for the Democratic Party’s nomination for President, she carries her mother’s memory with her. “Kamala brought Shyamala’s ashes with her,” Gopalan Balachandran, Harris’ uncle, as quoted by USA Today. “We went to Elliot’s Beach in the Bay of Bengal to immerse her ashes.”Harris' journey, deeply intertwined with her mother's legacy, continues to inspire many as she navigates her path in American politics.","Kamala Harris often reflects on the profound influence her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, had on her life and career.

He mentioned that several individuals were injured by ""a knifeman.""Emergency response included at least one helicopter and numerous police and emergency vehicles. Multiple streets in the area were cordoned off. Police reported that five people were seriously hurt, while the region's top security official, Herbert Reul, noted the number of injured could be six.""None of us knows why,"" Reul stated regarding the attack 's motive, further emphasizing the uncertainty about the attacker's identity. He added, ""I can't say anything about the motive now,"" noting that the suspect had departed the scene ""relatively quickly.""Solingen's mayor, Tim Kurzbach, expressed the community's collective grief in a Facebook post.

Recently, there has been increasing concern about knife violence across Germany.In May, an Afghan immigrant carried out a knife attack on members of a group opposing ""political Islam,"" resulting in the death of a police officer. This prompted Germany's interior minister, Nancy Faeser, to propose stricter weapons laws to limit the public carrying of knives to those with blades up to 6 centimetres (2.4 inches), down from the current 12 centimetres (4.7 inches) allowance.In June, a 29-year-old policeman died after being stabbed in the German city of Mannheim during an attack on a right-wing demonstration. An assault on a train in 2021 resulted in multiple individuals sustaining injuries from a stabbing.","An attacker with a knife killed three people and seriously wounded severals on Friday during a festival in Solingen, Germany.

He blasted her opening remarks, posting, ""Too many 'Thank yous,' too rapidly said, what's going on with her?""Trump went on tweeting spree on the vice president, focusing on her early remarks about her childhood and career aspirations. He urged her to address other pressing issues, writing, ""A lot of talk about childhood, we've got to get to the Border, Inflation, and Crime!""As Harris made a forceful defence of Ukraine and Nato in her speech, she attacked Trump’s past comments on the war in Ukraine.“As President, I will stand strong with Ukraine and our Nato allies,” Harris declared, highlighting her commitment to international alliances.She also said that five days before Russia invaded Ukraine, she warned President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and helped lead the US diplomatic response, rallying “more than 50 countries” to support Ukraine.In response, Trump defended his record on Nato, tweeting, ""Nato wasn’t paying their Bills, almost every Country was delinquent. When I said, 'If you don’t pay, we’re out, the United States is tired of being a sucker,' the money came rolling in by the BILLIONS, and I saved Nato!""Trump also seized the moment to criticise Harris on domestic issues, particularly immigration.

In March 2021, President Biden tasked Harris with addressing the ""root causes"" of migration to the US, a role distinct from direct oversight of border enforcement.Kamala Harris also highlighted Trump's past praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during her speech, asserting, “I will not cozy up to tyrants and dictators.”In reaction, Trump tweeted, ""The Tyrants are laughing at her; she’s weak and ineffective. For three and a half years, she has done nothing but enable them to become STRONG, RICH, and POWERFUL!""He further criticised Harris, stating, ""There will be no future under Comrade Kamala Harris because she will lead us into Nuclear World War III!

In 2024, the world continues to grapple with severe conflicts, political instability, and humanitarian crises, making certain regions extremely dangerous. Countries like Yemen, Afghanistan, and Sudan remain at the forefront of global concern due to ongoing conflicts that have devastated their populations and infrastructure.To explore and understand which countries face the highest levels of danger, we turn to the Global Peace Index (GPI) compiled by the Institute for Economics and Peace.The Global Peace Index (GPI) provides a critical measure of the safety and stability of nations, highlighting those most impacted by war, violence, and unrest.This non-profit organization annually evaluates 163 countries across 23 indicators, including internal conflicts, societal safety, and levels of militarization, providing a comprehensive assessment of global peace and security. Here’s the list of the most dangerous countries in the world.With a 2024 GPI score of 3.397, Yemen continues to be one of the world's most dangerous countries. Since the onset of civil conflict in 2015, the nation has been plunged into chaos, with widespread famine, disease, and infrastructure collapse exacerbating the situation.The conflict, which started as an internal struggle, has been prolonged and intensified by the involvement of neighbouring countries, each backing different factions. This has only deepened the suffering of the Yemeni people, who face unimaginable hardships daily.Sudan remains one of the most dangerous countries globally, primarily due to ongoing conflicts in regions like Darfur, South Kordofan, and Blue Nile. In 2024, these conflicts resulted in over 3,000 deaths and displaced nearly 2 million people.The humanitarian crisis is severe, with frequent attacks on civilians by government forces, opposition groups, and militias. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), approximately 14 million people in Sudan are in dire need of humanitarian aid.South Sudan, with a GPI score of 3.324, remains one of the world's most perilous countries due to ongoing civil conflict, ethnic violence, and political instability. Since gaining independence in 2011, the country has struggled to maintain peace and stability, with its citizens facing continuous threats from internal strife and external pressures.Afghanistan, with a 2024 GPI score of 3.294, continues to be one of the most dangerous countries worldwide. Decades of conflict, compounded by the Taliban's seizure of power in 2021, have left the nation in a state of constant instability.The risks of terrorism, kidnappings, and widespread violence remain high, making Afghanistan a focal point of international concern.Ukraine has witnessed a significant decline in safety and stability, particularly since the Russian invasion began in February 2022. By 2024, the conflict has claimed over 150,000 lives, with millions more displaced both internally and externally.The destruction of cities and critical infrastructure, including homes, schools, and hospitals, has created a humanitarian crisis of immense proportions.The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) continues to suffer from one of the deadliest conflicts in African history. The ongoing violence, which has spanned more than four and a half years, has resulted in more lives lost than any other conflict since World War II, according to the International Rescue Committee. The DRC remains a highly dangerous place, with widespread violence and instability threatening the lives of millions.In 2024, Russia's GPI score of 3.249 reflects the nation's increasing danger, exacerbated by the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. Internally, Russia faces significant challenges, including organized crime and corruption, which undermine law and order.Additionally, environmental concerns, such as industrial accidents and pollution, pose substantial health risks to the population.Since the onset of its civil war in 2011, Syria has been one of the world's most dangerous countries. The conflict has devastated infrastructure, leaving buildings, roads, hospitals, and schools in ruins.The humanitarian situation is dire, with over 13 million Syrians in need of assistance, including 6.6 million internally displaced. Food insecurity is rampant, and the healthcare system is in disarray, with many hospitals destroyed or operating at minimal capacity.Mali has been embroiled in armed conflict since January 2012, when Tuareg rebels seized control of the northern territory, declaring the independent nation of Azawad by April of that year. The situation escalated further with a military coup in March 2012, deepening the turmoil in the region. Today, Mali remains one of the most dangerous countries, with ongoing violence and instability threatening the safety of its citizens","The Global Peace Index (GPI) provides a critical measure of the safety and stability of nations. In 2024, the world continues to grapple with severe conflicts, political instability, and humanitarian crises, making certain regions extremely dangerous. Yemen, Afghanistan, and Sudan remain at the forefront of global concern due to ongoing conflicts.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112702024,imgsize-29000,width-400,resizemode-4/112702024.jpg"

The company identified the perpetrators as the same Iranian hacker group that recently compromised the Trump campaign.According to Meta's blog post, the hacking attempts involved a small number of accounts posing as technical support for various online services, including AOL, Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft.The company blocked these accounts after users flagged them as suspicious, and there was no evidence to suggest that the targeted WhatsApp accounts had been successfully compromised.The hacking group responsible for these attempts, known as APT42 , is believed to be connected to an intelligence division within Iran's military. This group is known for installing surveillance software on the mobile devices of its targets, allowing them to record calls, steal text messages, and secretly activate cameras and microphones.Meta linked APT42's activities to the recent efforts to breach US presidential campaigns , as reported by Microsoft and Google earlier this month, in the lead-up to the November US presidential election.

The interview, which took place on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, has gone viral because of a moment where Trump compared choosing a partner to picking an item from a restaurant menu.Back in 2004, Trump, who was then famous for The Apprentice, sat down with Conan O'Brien for what started as a lighthearted chat.But things took an unexpected turn when O'Brien brought up a notable scene from the show.In the clip, Trump, known for his direct approach, asked contestant Clay Lee a blunt question: ""Are you a homosexual, Clay?"" The straightforwardness of the question caught everyone off guard.Lee answered with a simple ""yes,"" and Trump seemed accepting of the answer. However, Trump didn't stop there and went on to ask if Lee found any of the female contestants attractive.""They're beautiful women,"" Lee said, though he added that they weren't his ""thing.""Then came the moment that has sparked fresh debates online. In what seemed like an attempt at humor or to show his acceptance, Trump compared choosing a partner to picking a dish from a menu.""That's why they have menus in restaurants,"" Trump said with a casual shrug. ""I like steak, someone else likes spaghetti. That's why they have menus in restaurants. A great world.""The comment, a mix of awkwardness and indifference, has sparked a wide range of reactions online. Some see it as a clumsy but well-intentioned effort to be inclusive, while others view it as a dismissive oversimplification of a complex issue, likening it to choosing a meal.Trump has always had a complicated relationship with LGBTQ rights. While his stance has often been ambiguous, the comment in the interview has resurfaced at a time when the issue of LGBTQ rights remains a divisive topic in American politics. For the 2024 presidential election, the Republican Party's new platform notably removed language that previously supported opposition to same-sex marriage, signaling a shift in tone, but the party remains deeply divided on the issue.","An old interview featuring former US president Donald Trump has resurfaced, causing a stir on social media.

Code Red in US: Comrade Kamala v Traitor Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/code-red-in-us-comrade-kamala-v-traitor-trump/articleshow/112746487.cms,"WASHINGTON: Mocking her laugh didn't work because her supporters began to celebrate its hearty timbre while pointing out that he only sneers and jeers, never laughs. Denigrating her character for a relationship she had 30 years ago with a man 30 years older did not work either because she is happily married now and he is not exactly a paragon of virtue, with a wife who is seldom seen with him.Disparaging her as a drunk didn't work because it did not pass the smell test. So Donald Trump and his supporters have finally hit on a line of attack they think will work in a country still fearful of communism: characterising her as a communist and calling her Comrade Kamala .The hashtag #ComradeKamala , accompanied by colorful memes, trended often during the DNC in Chicago as Trump and his supporters ratcheted up attacks on Harris' purported leftist orientation, with the former President himself leading the way.At his rallies and on social media, Trump has begun to call her ""Comrade Kamala,"" inferring that she got her socialist views from her father Donald Harris, a "" Marxist Economist "" in his view. And in live, real-time rebuttals as she made her acceptance speech at the DNC, Trump doubled down on the Communist caper in a string of social media posts.“There will be no future under Comrade Kamala Harris , because she will take us into a Nuclear World War III ! She will never be respected by the Tyrants of the World!” he said, ever as Harris supporters taunted him about his love for communist North Korean tyrant Kim Jong Un. “SAY GOODBYE TO THE U.S.A.! SHE IS A RADICAL MARXIST!” he wrote in his trademark all-caps another time, invoking the dark, dystopian view he has of America in a Democratic dispensation.""What they mean is that they want to get Elected, and then destroy our Country with Radical Left, Marxist/Socialist Policies. We can’t let this happen and, if it does, we won’t have a Country any longer. The U.S.A. will be reduced to ashes,"" he warned in another apocalyptic post.It is not clear if the tactic is working in a country where there is still some residual fear of communism although most communist countries have been cast into the dustbin of history. Even at the height of the Cold War, many Americans, most notably its Nobel laureate poet-singer Bob Dylan, parodied Washington's paranoia about domestic communists.""I got up in the mornin' 'n' looked under my bed/ Well, I wus lookin' everywhere for them gol-darned Reds/ Looked in the stove, behind the door/ Looked in the glove compartment of my car...Couldn't find 'em... I wus lookin' for them Reds everywhere/ I wus lookin' in the sink an' underneath the chair/ I looked way up my chimney hole/ I even looked deep inside my toilet bowl/ They got away..."" Dylan wrote in a song titled Talkin’ John Birch Paranoid Blues. John Birch Society was an American right-wing political advocacy group, named after spy who was killed in a confrontation with Chinese Communist soldiers.Dylan's idol Woody Guthrie was also an avowed socialist whose songs praised leftist ideals, including labor unions and worker rights, among the favorite talking points of vice-presidential nominee Tim Walz. “Walz said that socialism is just another word for neighborliness,” Trump told supporters in a recent rally, suggesting he's just toeing Kamala's ideology.Trump's treatise on Kamala and communism appears to have no takers outside his MAGA base. Even moderate Republicans scoff at the idea, particularly given his own cosiness with and admiration for communist dictators like Kim.""Donald Trump and his minions call Kamala a communist. I know communism. I fled communism from Nicaragua... let me tell you what communist dictators do...they attack the free press...they put their unqualified relatives in cushy government jobs so they can get rich... they refuse to accept legitimate elections when they lose and call for violence to stay in power. Do any of those things sound familiar? Is there anybody running for president who reminds you of that?"" Ana Navarro, a moderate Republican anti-Trumper said this week.","The hashtag #ComradeKamala trended often during the DNC in Chicago as Trump and his supporters ratcheted up attacks on Harris' purported leftist orientation.
