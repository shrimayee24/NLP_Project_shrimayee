SRINAGAR: J&K Police have initiated action against more than 100 people, including teenagers, for violating prohibitory orders on the use of Virtual Private Network (VPN) services.Cops Friday conducted a district-wide verification drive in south Kashmir’s Shopian, during which 15 people were identified using VPN services. According to police, detailed technical scrutiny and background verification did not reveal any terror-related links or adverse antecedents, so no FIR was registered in the matter.“However, as a preventive measure, security proceedings were initiated against 10 individuals, primarily belonging to the younger age group, for violation of the said orders,” a cop said. Under these security measures, they were warned to refrain from using VPN services in the future. “Out of the 15 individuals identified, five were minors who were counselled and advised in the presence of their guardians, with emphasis on awareness, lawful digital conduct, and the consequences of violating lawful orders,” he added.In south Kashmir’s Kulgam and Pulwama districts, cops have identified 101 people who used VPN services in violation of prohibitory orders.In Kulgam, police said security proceedings have been initiated against six persons. In Pulwama, 95 people were identified using VPN, but technical scrutiny of their devices and background verification found no terror-related links or adverse antecedents, so no FIR was registered. However, as a preventive measure, security proceedings have been initiated against 43 individuals, primarily in the 18–40 age group, for violating prohibitory orders.Earlier this week, police imposed a phased ban on VPN services across several districts in Kashmir Valley, issuing district-wise orders. VPN use was prohibited in Srinagar, Ganderbal, Kupwara, Shopian, Budgam, Pulwama, Kulgam and Anantnag, citing threats to national security and the possibility of their misuse to incite unrest.Following the imposition of restrictions, police have begun acting against violators. “How can I watch my favourite Irish and UK shows now?

What we know so far

Residents of the Bhagirathpura began reporting to hospitals across the city from Monday onwards, complaining of vomiting, high fever and diarrhoea.

Officials said the contamination occurred after sewage water from a toilet constructed at a local police check post seeped into the drinking water line.

After the outbreak, laboratory tests confirmed that the diarrhoea outbreak was caused by contaminated drinking water.

According to Indore's chief medical and health officer Dr Madhav Prasad Hasani, the report was prepared by city-based medical college.

It claimed that the water collected from Bhagirathpura were contaminated due to a leak in a main supply pipeline.

However, officials were yet to identify the specific bacteria responsible.

Madhya Pradesh CM Mohan Yadav issued a statement saying, ""Following the stern action taken against the responsible officials in connection with the tragic incident caused by the supply of contaminated drinking water in Indore, we are also taking corrective measures for other places in the state. For this purpose, instructions have been given to the concerned officials to prepare time-bound programs. In this regard, a virtual meeting of the mayors, chairpersons, and commissioners of all 16 municipal corporations, along with district collectors, officials from the health department, urban development department, public health engineering department, and other relevant headquarters-level officials, has been convened this evening. In this meeting, a review of the entire state will be conducted, and necessary instructions will be issued.""



The CM had also issued directions to get the Additional Commissioner from Indore, and to relieve the In-Charge Superintending Engineer. ""This morning, I reviewed the actions being taken by the state government in the Indore contaminated drinking water case with the Chief Secretary and other officials, and issued necessary directions. I also discussed the report presented by the Additional Chief Secretary (Urban Administration and Development).I issued directions to the Indore Municipal Corporation Commissioner and Additional Commissioner to issue a charge sheet notice in this regard, to immediately remove the Additional Commissioner from Indore, and to relieve the In-Charge Superintending Engineer of the duties of the Water Distribution Works Department. I also issued directions to fill the necessary posts in the Indore Municipal Corporation with immediate effect,"" said the CM.

Bhagirathpura, meanwhile, remains largely deserted. With more than 200 residents admitted to 27 hospitals across Indore, most families have been away attending to sick relatives.

After repairs and inspection, clean water was restored through the pipeline on Thursday. However, residents have been advised to boil water before consumption as a precaution.

Meanwhile, residents of Indore's Bhagirathpura area remain afraid of consuming even the tanker-supplied water following a contaminated drinking water incident that left several people ill and claimed lives.

Despite assurances from the municipal corporation and the deployment of water tankers, locals said that they didn't have trust in the water supply system.

""We had been complaining about dirty water for several days, but no one was listening and several people were falling ill. My daughter, Kanak Lashkari (15), is currently admitted to the Arvindo hospital. My mother, aged 93, fell ill on December 24, but after treatment she has now recovered. We are now buying water for drinking, and for other uses, we rely on government boring water. The municipal corporation is supplying drinking water via tankers, but we are afraid to consume it. We no longer have trust in this supply. This is destruction being carried out in the name of development,"" a local resident said.

Earlier, Madhya Pradesh Urban Development and Housing Minister Kailash Vijayvargiya stressed that micro-checking in the entire colony is in progress and will be completed in 8-10 days. ""There were possibilities of contamination of water with sewage; therefore, treatment had already begun earlier, and the same treatment continues now. Micro-checking is underway across the entire colony and will take 8 to 10 days..."", he said.

NEW DELHI: At least 10 people have died while more the 1,400 are affected due to a diarrhoea outbreak caused by contaminated water in Bhagirathpura area of Madhya Pradesh's Indore.“According to health department data, four people have died due to the diarrhea outbreak in Bhagirathpura. However, I have received information about 10 deaths due to this outbreak,” Indore Mayor Pushyamitra Bhargava told PTI.Madhya Pradesh CM also issued a statement assuring action and ordering removal of Additional Commissioner from Indore, and In-Charge Superintending Engineer from duties.This comes after – according to officials – a leakage was found in the main drinking water supply pipeline near a police outpost in Bhagirathpura, at a spot over which a toilet has been constructed. They claimed the leakage led to contamination of the water supply.According to locals, one of the victims, who was just six-month-old, died after he fell sick due to alleged consumption of contaminated water.According to the family, the child fell ill with diarrhoea on December 26 and was taken to a local doctor, who prescribed medication. The family brought the child back home after check-up, but on December 29, the infant suffered a high fever and died at home.","At least 1,400 are affected by a diarrhoea outbreak caused by contaminated water.

Pak's belated assertion on conflict pause raises brows

NEW DELHI: Pakistan has endorsed Beijing's claim that it played a mediating role in the May 2025 India-Pakistan conflict that led to Op Sindoor.At a press briefing on Thursday, Pak Foreign Office spokesperson, Tahir Andrabi, said Chinese leaders were ""in constant touch"" with Pakistan's leadership and had also made ""certain contacts with the Indian leadership in those three, four days in May, 6th to 10th and maybe prior to that and after that""""So, I think those contacts, which were characterised by a very positive diplomatic exchanges, they did constitute in bringing down temperatures and trying to bring peace and security in the region. So, I'm sure that the Chinese characterisation of mediation is correct,"" he said.Islamabad's statement, the first-ever about Beijing's alleged role in brokering the pause in the four-day conflict with India, should raise eyebrows because of the lag and because it had so far given the credit for suspension of hostilities exclusively to US President Donald Trump.India had maintained that the military pause followed a request from Pakistan's DGMO to its Indian counterpart, and not the result of any third-party intervention. It dismissed Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi's claim that Beijing had mediated during the crisis.Andrabi said Pakistan shared China's assessment, calling the efforts ""diplomacy for peace, for prosperity, for security"" and that ""this has been the hallmark of a number of international efforts that went into resolving that conflict in those three-four fateful days"". Pakistan, he added, ""firmly"" supported China's position as stated by its foreign minister.China's claim mimics repeated assertions by US President Trump that Washington played a decisive role in ending the confrontation between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.","Pakistan has endorsed Beijing's claim that it played a mediating role in the May 2025 India-Pakistan conflict that led to Op Sindoor.

Crackdown On Officials AsToll Rises To 10

Cleanest City Hit By Water Contamination As Lab Links Indore Diarrhoea Outbreak To Pipeline Leak

INDORE: The Madhya Pradesh govt removed Indore municipal commissioner Dilip Kumar Yadav and suspended additional commissioner Rohit Sisoniya on Friday, its first major action in the contaminated water tragedy in Indore's Bhagirathpura, since people began falling ill on Dec 29 in a city ranked on multiple occasions as India's cleanest. The action came on a day the death toll in the tragedy rose to 10 with the death of a 68-year-old woman.Pradeep Nigam, in-charge superintendent engineer of Indore Municipal Corporation's (IMC) water distribution department, was also removed from his post. Three additional commissioners - Akash Prakhar Singh and Ashish Kumar Pathak - were posted to the IMC after a meeting chaired by additional chief secretary Sanjay Dubey, who has been camping in Indore.Submitting a status report, the state govt, however, told the MP high court Friday that only four deaths had been recorded. Indore mayor Pushyamitra Bhargava said Friday he had information of 10 deaths due to the diarrhoea outbreak in Bhagirathpura.According to health department data, four people have died due to the diarrhoea outbreak in Bhagirathpura. However, I have received information about 10 deaths due to this outbreak,” the mayor said.“A total of 294 patients have been admitted, of which 93 have been discharged. Around 201 patients are still admitted and 32 patients are in ICUs,” the status report submitted to HC said.Hours before the IMC shake-up, CM Mohan Yadav wrote on X: “I reviewed action being taken by state govt in the Indore contaminated drinking water case with the chief secretary and other senior officials and issued necessary directions. I also discussed the report presented by the additional chief secretary in charge of the urban development department.”“We have taken the contaminated water case with utmost seriousness. We have taken action against those found guilty of negligence. There will be no compromise when it comes to health of the people. We will fix responsibility and ensure strict action,” the CM wrote on X.As the administrative changes unfolded, a flurry of activity was noticed in Bhagirathpura, where IMC workers cleaned streets and supplied water in tankers, health workers checked patients and distributed medicines, and ASHA workers conducted door-to-door surveys, checking on children. On Friday, gloom pervaded the residence of Geetabai Dhruvkar, 68. “She was admitted with diarrhoea and vomiting... Her kidneys gave way. She died Friday morning,” said her brother-in-law, Chandrashekhar Dhruvkar.Indore Municipal Corporation vehicles made announcements in Bhagirathpura asking people to avoid using tap water, which was being flushed after plugging all leakages and tested for contamination, and use tanker water. Residents were told to boil their drinking water.","The Madhya Pradesh govt removed Indore municipal commissioner Dilip Kumar Yadav and suspended additional commissioner Rohit Sisoniya on Friday.

‘Won’t Serve The 1%’: Zohran Mamdani Promises ‘New Era’ To New Yorkers In First Speech As Mayor

Mamdani's letter to Umar Khalid







NEW DELHI: Student activist Umar Khalid, who has been in jail for nearly five years in connection with the Feb 2020 Delhi riots , has received a show of solidarity from New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani , who wrote to him, saying, ""we are all thinking of you"".The note, undated, was shared on X by Khalid's partner Banojyotsna Lahiri on Thursday, after Mamdani was sworn in as mayor in a midnight ceremony.In the handwritten note, Mamdani said: ""Dear Umar, I think of your words on bitterness often, and the importance of not letting it consume oneself. It was a pleasure to meet your parents. We are all thinking of you."" TOI reached out to Mamdani's office about the note; there was no response at the time of going to press.Khalid, a former JNU student, was arrested in Sept 2020 and charged under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) for allegedly conspiring to incite riots in Delhi, charges he has consistently denied. Khalid was granted temporary bail in Dec to attend his sister's wedding.Khalid’s father, Syed Qasim Rasool Ilyas, told TOI that the family met Mamdani early Dec last year during a visit to the United States to meet Khalid’s sister.Ilyas said he had sought time from Mamdani to congratulate him on his appointment and ended up meeting him and his wife for around half an hour. “He gave us time exclusively and we discussed many things, including Umar’s incarceration. We hoped he would fulfil the promises he has made for the people of New York,” he said.“We also spoke about what has been happening to my son and the developments around his case. Mamdani said he follows it and has read Umar’s letters from jail,” he added.“This prolonged incarceration itself is unjust, and that is why it has attracted international attention,” Lahiri said.Ilyas said he also met Democrat Jamie Raskin of the US Congress separately. “He raised concerns over Umar’s arrest and extended support,” he said. “I told him the matter is currently before Supreme Court and the family is positive about a favourable outcome.” Raskin shared a photograph online with Ilyas and his wife.Raskin, along with three other US Congress members, wrote to India’s ambassador to the United States, Vinay Mohan Kwatra, on Dec 30, expressing concern over Khalid’s continued pre-trial detention. The lawmakers said Khalid has been denied bail for five years under UAPA, arguing that the “pre-trial treatment to which he has been subjected is punitive in and of itself”.","Student activist Umar Khalid has been in jail for nearly five years in connection with the Feb 2020 Delhi riots.

Cleanliness Crown Cracks As Indore Loses 13 Lives To Poisoned Water And Administrative Lapses

INDORE: A deathly silence prevails in Bhagirathpura area of Indore. Barring a few people at makeshift medical camps, its lanes are empty. With over 200 people from the area admitted in as many as 27 hospitals across the city after being afflicted with diarrhoea, most residents have been away attending to the ill since Monday night when they began vomiting and developed high fever. Nine persons have died till now.Tragedy struck Bhagirathpura when a pit to clear waste from a toilet built at the local police check post began leaking, leading to the waste water mixing with the main water supply line that ran just beneath it. Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) officials said the contractor had channeled the output from the toilet to a pit above the main water supply line rather than constructing a septic tank and connecting it to the sewage line.On Thursday, even as Madhya Pradesh govt officials scrambled to fix responsibility, spruce up treatment facilities, and clean up the water supply system, Sadhana Sahu, a teacher at a private school, sat on the doorstep of her home in Bhagirathpura and wept uncontrollably. She has lost her six-month-old son. ""Abhyan was born 10 years after we had a daughter. Bas, mera bachcha nahin raha (My child is no more),"" Sadhana said.Abhyan's father, Sunil Sahu, who works from home for an internet firm, said, ""He had diarrhoea and fever. We took him to a doctor on Dec 26. We brought him back home after he was prescribed medicines. He was fine the next two days but suddenly developed high fever, vomited, and died at home on Monday. We couldn't even take him to a hospital.""""The contaminated water caused his death. I had mixed water with his milk and his health deteriorated,"" Sadhana said.Wailing could be heard from some of the homes where death had struck. Almost every household in Bhagirathpura - which has a population of about 15,000, most from economically weak sections living cheek-by-jowl - has one or more people afflicted.""We earn little and barely manage to survive,"" said Alguram Yadav of Borasi ki Gali. His wife Urmila, 65, died on Sunday. His son Sanju, daughter-in-law Roshini and grandson Shivam (11 months) are admitted to hospitals with the same symptoms that took Urmila's life.""Nobody had turned up to help, though some administrative officials came to check.

Charlie Kirk's Old Nicki Minaj Comments Resurface After His Widow Erika Shares Stage With Rapper

Brian Harpole, Candace Owens, and the video that sparked online debate





A newly resurfaced video has put fresh focus on the death of Charlie Kirk, weeks after he was shot at a public event. The clip shows Brian Harpole, who was part of Kirk’s security team, standing in the crowd shortly before the shooting. The video began spreading on X in late December 2025 and quickly caught public attention. Many people online are now asking questions about what happened just before the attack. Some users are urging Candace Owens to look into the footage. At the same time, police have been clear. They say Tyler Robinson is the only suspect in custody, and no official report has linked Harpole to the killing.The shooting took place at Utah Valley University on 10 September 2025 during a Turning Point USA event. While the video has raised debate online, authorities say the investigation has not changed.The video at the center of the discussion is made up of short clips from the event. In the footage, a man believed by some X users to be Brian Harpole is seen standing among attendees. His arms are folded, and one hand is partly hidden. Some viewers say this looks strange. Others say the clip shows nothing unusual and no sign of a weapon or violent act.The video gained attention after it was posted by Blake Bednarz on 29 December 2025. Bednarz wrote that the man in the video “had his folded arms with right hand hidden under his armpit when he squeezed.” Other users pushed back right away. They said the clip lacks clear context and does not prove anything.As the clip spread, several users asked Candace Owens to review it. One user, Katie Ash, wrote on 30 December 2025, “I have been screaming this since Candace and Erika’s meeting!” Another account said the video looked important but asked how such claims could be proven. Some reactions were emotional, with users saying the situation was upsetting, while others questioned how the event was handled.Candace Owens had already mentioned Harpole on her podcast on 9 December 2025. She said, “I received SHOCKING information which puts Charlie’s last trip to Asia in a new light. And it involves his security detail, Brian Harpole.” Owens added that the claim came from a man in witness protection. She did not share documents or proof. Police have not confirmed her claim and continue to say Robinson is the only suspect.Brian Harpole is a former Texas police officer with 14 years of experience. He later started Integrity Security Solutions. In November 2025, he appeared on The Shawn Ryan Show and spoke about security planning. He said about the venue choice, “That’s where they told us to have it.” No evidence has tied him to the shooting.Also Read: Candace Owens Highlights New Claims Raising Serious Questions After Eyewitness Mitch Snow Shares Details On Charlie Kirk Death Timeline","A newly resurfaced video has put fresh focus on the death of Charlie Kirk, weeks after he was shot at a public event.

Caolan Robertson raises doubts over Nick Shirley’s reporting style and Minnesota fraud claims







Nick Shirley’s viral Minnesota daycare video is now facing fresh questions after Irish journalist Caolan Robertson said Shirley once told him his work was “satire,” not real journalism. The claim comes as Shirley’s recent fraud allegations continue to spread online and gain attention from high-profile figures.Shirley’s Minnesota video, posted in mid-December, suggested daycare centers were empty while receiving public funds. The clip went viral and was even retweeted by JD Vance on December 28. In his post, Vance praised Shirley’s work and called it “far more useful” than the 2024 Pulitzer Prize-winning reporting.But Robertson says Shirley’s past actions raise serious doubts. Robertson, who previously interviewed Shirley in Ukraine, says Shirley made videos suggesting there was no war happening there. When confronted in Kyiv, Robertson claims Shirley admitted his work was not journalism.“When I confronted Nick about what he did here in Kyiv, he said what he was doing wasn’t journalism, it was satire, and his entire reporting started to fall apart,” Robertson said.Robertson shared a clip from their interview to support his claim. He also said people who guided Shirley in Kyiv later told him Shirley was shown bombed locations, including a children’s hospital, but chose not to show them in his videos.Robertson believes Shirley follows the same pattern wherever he goes. He says Shirley films a small area, makes big claims, and then moves on without showing full facts.“Nick has a very specific talent. He shows up somewhere, films a couple of streets, announces he’s cracked the whole story. No data, no depth. Just vibes,” Robertson said. “Then we jump to Minneapolis. It’s the same tactic — drop in, film selectively, inflame, provoke, declare victory, go viral.”One location featured in Shirley’s Minnesota video was ABC Learning Center in Minneapolis. Shirley suggested the daycare was empty. But when CBS News visited the center later in December, reporters found more than a dozen children inside, along with several staff members.Director Ahmed Hasan told CBS News the children were working on math and basic language skills. His wife, Umi Hasan, who helps run the center, said she believes Shirley’s video was politically motivated.“We pay our taxes. We do whatever we can to be a law-abiding citizen. When one Somali does something wrong, we all get collective punishment,” Umi Hasan said.Ahmed Hasan also said the center received constant phone calls from people outside Minnesota after the video went viral, adding to stress for staff and families.Also Read: Who Is Nick Shirley?

The case of the football coach who vanished on Christmas Day







A weeks-long search that began with worry and hope has ended in tragedy in Gloucester County. Authorities confirmed that a body believed to be missing football coach Stephen Iannotti was found on December 31. Iannotti, 72, disappeared on Christmas Day, triggering an intense investigation and a growing sense of concern across the area where he was widely known and respected.For decades, Iannotti served as a math teacher and football coach in New Jersey. He was more than an educator to many. He was a familiar and trusted presence. When he failed to respond to calls on Christmas, family members alerted the police. A welfare check at his Logan Township home found no sign of him, marking the start of a search that would deeply affect his family.Investigators later revealed that Stephen Iannotti ’s phone had been left inside his home. This detail matched what relatives explained was his usual habit of leaving without it. Officials later confirmed that he had been located, but the outcome was tragic. Authorities said he was deceased and added that, out of respect for his family and privacy, no further updates would be shared on the case.According to law enforcement updates reported by NJ.com, home surveillance footage showed Iannotti’s black Jeep Wrangler leaving his residence at 12:45 p.m.on the Friday after Christmas. Minutes later, a license plate reader recorded the vehicle near Center Square Road and Heron Drive.

Who is Christian Sturdivant? ISIS-inspired teen captured by FBI before he could pull off 'terrorist attack' in North Carolina on New Year’s Eve,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-christian-sturdivant-isis-inspired-teen-captured-by-fbi-before-he-could-pull-off-a-terrorist-attack-in-north-carolina-on-new-years-eve/articleshow/126311946.cms,"



An 18-year-old from Mint Hill, North Carolina, is accused of plotting a deadly New Year’s Eve attack in support of the Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham, before FBI agents moved in to stop him.The suspect was identified as Christian Sturdivant, who planned to stab civilians at public locations using knives, firearms and hammers, with the aim of killing as many people as possible.Sturdivant was arrested on December 31, 2025, and has been charged with attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organisation. The criminal complaint was unsealed after he appeared in federal court in Charlotte. He remains in custody.Officials said the alleged plot targeted a grocery store and a fast food restaurant and was in its final stages. Attorney General Pam Bondi said, “This successful collaboration between federal and local law enforcement saved American lives from a horrific terrorist attack on New Year’s Eve.”According to court documents, the FBI became aware of Sturdivant on December 18, 2025, after receiving information about social media posts in which he praised ISIS , a designated terrorist organisation by many countries. Earlier that month, he allegedly shared an image mocking Christianity, accompanied by hateful language similar to ISIS propaganda calling for violence against non-believers.According to the FBI, Sturdivant began communicating online with an undercover federal agent posing as an ISIS supporter. During those conversations, Sturdivant allegedly said, “I will do jihad soon,” and referred to himself as “a soldier of the state,” a phrase linked to ISIS.On December 14, he sent the federal agent an image showing two hammers and a knife. Prosecutors say the image was similar to ISIS propaganda encouraging knife attacks in Western countries. On December 19, he allegedly sent a voice recording pledging loyalty to ISIS.FBI Director Kash Patel said, “The accused allegedly wanted to be a soldier for ISIS and made plans to commit a violent attack on New Year’s Eve in support of that terrorist group, but the FBI and our partners put a stop to that.”A search of Sturdivant’s home on December 29 uncovered handwritten notes, including one titled “New Years Attack 2026”. Prosecutors say the document listed equipment such as a vest, mask, tactical gloves and knives, and described a plan to stab up to 20 or 21 civilians. The note also includes a so-called “martyrdom op” in which Sturdivant intended to attack police responding to the scene so he would die as a martyr.John A. Eisenberg, Assistant Attorney General for National Security, said, “As alleged, Sturdivant aspired to become a ‘martyr’ for ISIS and was in the final stages of planning a mass-casualty attack on New Year’s Eve.”The FBI said they found two butcher knives and two hammers hidden under Sturdivant’s bed, along with a list of targets and tactical gear. Investigators believe these items matched those shown in messages sent to the undercover contact.If convicted, Sturdivant faces up to 20 years in federal prison. Prosecutors said that the charges remain allegations and that he is presumed innocent unless proven guilty in court.","Christian Sturdivant, 18, from Mint Hill, North Carolina, is accused of plotting a deadly New Year’s Eve attack in support of the Islamic State in Iraq and al- Sham.

Can the US revoke citizenship? Trump administration weighs denaturalisation in Minnesota fraud case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/can-the-us-revoke-citizenship-trump-administration-weighs-denaturalisation-in-minnesota-fraud-case/articleshow/126278329.cms,"Minnesota Crackdown: DOJ Raids Somali-Americans, 100 Arrested In Shocking Med 'Fraud'





The Trump administration was exploring the denaturalisation of Somali-Americans in Minnesota who engaged in fraud, a move that would seek to strip US citizenship from those who illegally obtained tax dollars intended for social services.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt discussed the potential action in a December 31 appearance on Fox News, one day after the US Department of Health and Human Services froze childcare payments to Minnesota following what the agency said was fraud at daycares in the state.""We're also not afraid to use denaturalization,"" Leavitt said. ""That's a tool at the president and the secretary of state's disposal, and it's one this administration has previously used before.""""Absolutely,"" Leavitt said when asked whether Trump wanted Somali-Americans' citizenship revoked if they were convicted of fraud. “It’s something the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State is currently looking at right now.""Federal prosecutors charged 86 individuals with felonies for exploiting federal tax dollars intended to help hungry children during the COVID-19 pandemic for personal gain.More than 60 pleaded guilty or were convicted so far. The case was originally brought by the Biden administration, US Today reported.Of the 86 people charged in a sprawling $250 million case involving Minnesota-administered programmes, 78 were identified as Somali-Americans. Minnesota was home to about 80,000 Somali immigrants, the largest of any state. Most were naturalised citizens, foreign-born individuals who went through a legal process to gain their citizenship.Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, in a December 30 appearance on The Charlie Kirk Show podcast, said DHS investigators were currently going ""door to door"" to suspected fraud sites in Minnesota ""to make sure we follow the money here and we bring arrests, prosecutions and ultimately removals.""The White House also seized on a recent viral video from conservative influencer Nick Shirley that claimed abandoned daycare centres were receiving millions in state taxpayer dollars. FBI Director Kash Patel on Dec. 28 said his agency had ""surged personnel and investigative resources to Minnesota to dismantle large-scale fraud schemes exploiting federal programs.""Stripping citizenship from naturalised US citizens was rare and had a high bar. Federal courts, not the administration, made the final decisions. Denaturalisation could be pursued through either civil proceedings or a criminal conviction.During President Donald Trump's first term in office, the Justice Department filed 168 denaturalisation cases in federal court, while the Biden administration filed 64 such cases, a database created by Irina Mantra, a Hofstra University law professor, found. An average of 11 denaturalisation cases per year were filed between 1990 and 2007.The general grounds for denaturalisation involved the ""illegal procurement of naturalization"" or the ""concealment of a material fact or willful misrepresentation,"" according to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services, a federal agency. In addition, the federal govt could cite an individual's current or past affiliation with a totalitarian political party or terrorist organisation.Demonstrators rallied in protest against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), amid a reported federal immigration operation targeting the Somali community, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, US, December 8, 2025.Trump called Somali immigrants in Minnesota ""garbage,"" igniting pushback from immigrant rights advocates who argued the White House's focus on the Minnesota fraud case was an excuse to target the immigrant population. Trump and Republicans blamed Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the 2024 Democratic vice presidential nominee, for allowing the fraud to unfold.Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minnesota, a close ally of Trump, called for the denaturalisation of Somali-Americans convicted of fraud in a Dec. 30 post on Facebook.“I have three words regarding Somalis who have committed fraud against American taxpayers: Send them home. If they’re here illegally, deport them immediately; if they’re naturalized citizens, revoke their citizenship and deport them quickly thereafter,"" Emmer said.","White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt discussed the potential action in a December 31 appearance on Fox News.

Speaking in a recent interview, Errol Musk warned that America would ‘collapse’ if the white population becomes a minority within the next two decades, calling the shift “a very, very bad thing to happen. ”Musk raised questions about the implications of the demographic change, asking, “You want to see the U.S. go down? Why? You don’t like electric cars, and you don’t like technology? What is it, you want to go back to the jungle?” Along with this, he also spoke about South Africa, claiming that the “small white population that projects the European culture” has contributed significantly to the growth and development of the Black African population.

Zohran Mamdani Takes Oath On Quran In Historic First As New York Muslim Mayor | WATCH

.





Less than 24 hours after taking the oath, New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani began his first full day in office with a routine familiar to millions of New Yorkers, a morning subway commute from his Queens apartment.Battling against the cold, the 34-year-old Democrat left the one-bedroom apartment in Queens on Friday. Unlike most commuters, Mamdani’s journey was documented by a photo and video crew with neighbors stopping to wish him luck as he headed to work.The subway ride came ahead of a busy first day that included signing orders, announcing appointments and facing questions from the press. Still, the mayor chose to begin with what aides described as a deliberately symbolic commute.Flanked by security guards and a small group of aides, Mamdani boarded a Manhattan-bound train, pausing to take selfies with surprised riders before settling into a corner seat to review briefing materials. The video of his subway ride went viral across social media.When two French tourists, puzzled by the attention, approached him, Mamdani introduced himself as “the new mayor of New York.” When met with disbelief, he held up the morning’s New York Daily News, which featured his photograph on the front page, according to the Associated Press.Videos of the subway ride began circulating online within minutes of Mamdani’s arrival at City Hall, drawing widespread attention and praise from supporters who viewed the moment as a reflection of his campaign message.While the ride served as a carefully timed public moment, it also aligned with Mamdani’s inaugural pledge to ensure his “government looks and lives like the people it represents.”Several past New York City mayors, including Eric Adams, Bill de Blasio and Michael Bloomberg, have similarly used public transit early in their terms to signal accessibility and to connect with the residents.Mamdani’s first commute was followed by a history-making swearing-in ceremony on Thursday. The Indian-origin leader became New York City’s first South Asian and Muslim mayor, as well as the second-youngest mayor in the city’s history, after taking his oath during a private ceremony at the historic Old City Hall subway station.In a first for the city, Mamdani was sworn in on a Quran from the New York Public Library’s Schomburg Center collection, marking the first time a New York City mayor has taken the oath of office on Islam’s holy text.",New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani began his first full day in office with a routine familiar to millions of New Yorkers.

NEW DELHI: Two women have been arrested for allegedly kidnapping a four-day-old baby boy from a hospital in Rohini’s Sector 6. The kidnapping was planned by the infant’s aunt over an old grudge.Police had received a complaint from the infant’s mother on Wednesday claiming that her son had been kidnapped from the hospital. A case was registered under sections 137 (kidnapping) and 140 (kidnapping or abducting in order to murder or for ransom etc) under the BNS at North Rohini police station.“CCTV footage revealed that the child’s aunt (maternal uncle’s wife) Suman Devi had asked the mother to hand him over to one Pooja Soni, also known as Radha, who claimed to be working at the hospital,” said DCP (Rohini) Rajeev Ranjan.The senior cop added that Soni had told the family that she would help the mother with the vaccination of the child. But the vaccination centre was reportedly shut by the time. She then took him from them on the pretext of weighing him and fled, police added.When Suman Devi, a 45-year-old homemaker from Sagar Pur, was apprehended from the spot, she confessed to planning the kidnapping of the child with assistance from Soni.Co-accused Soni had pretended to be an employee of the hospital and had handed over the baby to Suman’s 14-year-old daughter at her home. The baby was found after a raid at Suman’s house and was returned to his mother.Soni, a 43-year-old cook and domestic helper from Uttam Nagar, was also nabbed. Police said Suman had planned the kidnapping to take revenge for an old grudge with her inlaws i.e. the child’s mother and maternal grandmother. A senior police officer said that Suman believed that the child’s mother was involved in black magic which had caused her to lose her babies in the past.In Nov, a four-month-old boy was rescued from a female kidnapper, who worked at an IVF centre in Ghaziabad. She had allegedly taken him from a footpath near the Old Delhi Railway Station in north Delhi in her desire for a male child. In April, a 27-year-old woman was arrested for allegedly abducting a newborn from a hospital suspectedly after failing to conceive during her seven years of marriage.",Two women have been arrested for allegedly kidnapping a four-day-old baby boy.

Bhagwat hails spirit of RSS volunteers







BHOPAL: Seeking to clear what he claimed to be a lot of misunderstandings and misconceptions surrounding the organisation, Rashtritya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat said, ""If you try to understand the RSS through the activities of the BJP, then it will be difficult"".Addressing a select group of intellectual audience at the Ravindra Bhavan auditorium here, the Sangh chief said, ""Our work is different, and the procedure, too, is different. You also cannot understand the RSS by looking at the Vishwa Hindu Parishad or Vidya Bharti.""Elaborating on the Sangh's core functionality, Bhagwat said it works towards organising the entire Hindu society, raising volunteers and dedicating them to the service of the motherland and shaping the country's future. He said the organisation's focus was to keep ""India as Bharat"" and take it to greater heights.""The Sangh has completed 100 years since inception, but the journey hasn't been easy,"" Bhagwat said.He argued that no other voluntary organisation has faced as much oppression, opposition and protest as the RSS. ""Our volunteers have been attacked, harassed, and even murdered,"" the Sarsangchalak said, adding, ""Yet, despite all that came their way, they did not retreat into inactivity and silence.Rather, they kept themselves engaged in what we regard as divine work. Our volunteers get nothing in return for all their efforts, and, in fact, lose everything they have along the way. ""Bhagwat said the organisation is run on 'guru-dakshina' (voluntary contributions) collected from volunteers, adding that the funds are not raised through charity or donations but whatever they save and set aside from their own expenses.""They never ask for funds but cut back from their day-to-day expenses to save money. Some of our swayamsevaks do not even sip tea throughout the year, as they deposit the cost they would have incurred, otherwise, as funds for the organisation. In the beginning, the organisation was small and hence, our functionaries travelled on bicycles and even went hungry for days. Today, the organisation has grown bigger, bringing with it the culture of 'guru-dakshina'. But even now, we face shortage of funds from March to July,"" Bhagwat said. tnn","Mohan Bhagwat: Not right to view RSS through BJP activities.

'Woke in terror'

Loudspeakers on lampposts





SAN MARCOS: A 6.5-magnitude earthquake rattled Mexico's capital and a tourist hotspot on the Pacific coast on Friday, killing at least two people and causing moderate damage in a small town near the epicenter.The US Geological Survey said the quake struck shortly before 8:00 am near Acapulco, a major port and beach resort.It was felt around 400 kilometers (250 miles) away to the north in Mexico City, where alarms sent people rushing into the street for safety, disrupting a holiday weekend.A 60-year-old man died after falling while evacuating his second-floor apartment in the capital, local authorities said.Twelve others were injured, city Mayor Clara Brugada wrote on social media, but there were no reports of major damage in the country's largest city.President Claudia Sheinbaum was forced to evacuate the presidential palace during her regular morning press conference.Mexico's National Seismological Service said that the earthquake's epicenter was situated 14 kilometers southwest of the town of San Marcos in the state of Guerrero.Sheinbaum said there were no immediate reports of major damage, but in San Marcos, the effects were visible.A woman in her fifties ""lost her life when her house collapsed on top of her,"" said Guerrero Governor Evelyn Salgado.San Marcos Mayor Misael Lorenzo Castillo said around 50 houses were destroyed and ""all the houses have cracks.""Residents showed an AFP journalist the cracks in the walls of their homes and sections of collapsed walls.""San Marcos has been badly affected, devastated,"" lamented Rogelio Moreno, a resident, standing in front of his damaged home.Mexico is situated between five tectonic plates and as such is one of the world's most seismically active countries.Karen Gomez, a 47-year-old office worker living on the 13th floor of an apartment building in Mexico City, told AFP she was roused from her sleep by a street siren.""I woke up in terror. My cellphone alert said it was a powerful earthquake.""Norma Ortega, a 57-year-old kindergarten director, living in a 10th-floor apartment, said she could feel her building shake.In Acapulco, Ricardo, a tourist from the central Mexican state of Morelos, fled his hotel shirtless after sirens sounded.The center of Mexico City is built on the muddy subsoil of what was once the bed of a lake, making it particularly vulnerable to earthquakes.The quakes most strongly felt usually originate off Guerrero state on the Pacific coast.On September 19, 1985, an 8.1-magnitude earthquake devastated a vast swathe of Mexico City, leaving nearly 13,000 dead, mostly in the city, according to official figures.In 2017, also on September 19, a 7.1-magnitude quake killed 369 people, also mostly in Mexico City.Early warning systems, including smartphone apps, have been developed to warn citizens strong quakes and urge them to reach safety.Mexico City has also installed loudspeakers on lampposts to broadcast the alerts.","A 6.5-magnitude earthquake rattled Mexico's capital and a tourist hotspot on the Pacific coast on Friday.

'Reckless & inflammatory threats': Iran writes to UNSC after Trump remarks; warns US of escalation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/reckless-inflammatory-threats-iran-writes-to-unsc-after-trump-remarks-warns-us-of-escalation/articleshow/126316313.cms,"Donald Trump (AP image)





Iran’s Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Amir-Saeid Iravani, has formally written to the UN Security Council and UN Secretary-General António Guterres condemning the “reckless and inflammatory threats” made by US President Donald Trump Tehran also warned that the United States would bear full responsibility for any consequences or escalation that might arise from such statements.In the letter dated January 2, Iran accused the US president of openly threatening the use of force against a sovereign UN member state, asserting that such remarks amounted to a clear violation of international law and the UN Charter.Drawing attention to Trump’s recent comments, the Iranian envoy said the US president had gone beyond rhetoric by publicly declaring: “We are locked and loaded and ready to go.”Iravani said the statement amounted to “the incitement of violence, unrest, and terrorist acts within Iran” and constituted “a clear, explicit, and unlawful threat of the use of force against a sovereign State.”Trump’s remarks came amid widening protests in Iran over economic hardship, soaring inflation and a sharp fall in the national currency. In a post on Truth Social, the US president warned Iranian authorities against killing protesters, saying the United States would “come to their rescue” if peaceful demonstrators were harmed, before adding that Washington was “locked and loaded.”""Only days earlier, the President of the United States publicly threatened the Islamic Republic of Iran with the use of force, including renewed military attacks against Iran’s peaceful nuclear facilities and its defensive capabilities. These repeated and deliberate statements demonstrate a consistent pattern of unlawful conduct by the United States and constitute a clear, explicit, and unlawful threat of the use of force against a sovereign State, as well as interference in its internal affairs,"" the letter read.Iravani stressed that international law strictly prohibits such threats, regardless of political justification. “Such threats, irrespective of political pretexts or rhetorical framing, are strictly prohibited under international law,” the letter said, citing Articles 2(1), 2(4) and 2(7) of the UN Charter.The letter also accused Washington of encouraging unrest as a pretext for pressure or intervention, calling it “a grave violation of Iran’s sovereignty, political independence, and territorial integrity.” It added that the encouragement or facilitation of violent activity within another state constituted “an internationally wrongful act.”Placing the current tensions in historical context, the Iranian envoy pointed to what he described as a long record of US intervention, including the 1953 coup against Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh, support for Saddam Hussein during the Iran-Iraq war, the 1988 shooting down of Iran Air Flight 655, the killing of Major General Qassem Soleimani and the imposition of decades-long sanctions.He also referred to joint US-Israeli attacks in June 2025, which he said targeted civilians, infrastructure, and peaceful nuclear facilities.Calling on the UN to act, Iran urged the Security Council “to unequivocally and strongly condemn these reckless and provocative statements” and to demand that the United States “cease all threats or uses of force” and comply with its obligations under international law.The letter concluded with a direct warning, stating: “The Islamic Republic of Iran unequivocally rejects and strongly condemns these reckless, interventionist, and inflammatory statements, and reaffirms its inherent right to defend its sovereignty, territorial integrity, and national security.”Iranian officials have strongly rejected the warning. Foreign minister Abbas Araghchi described Trump’s comments as “reckless and dangerous”.Araghchi said that the protests were largely peaceful and driven by economic pressure and warned that any interference in Iran’s internal affairs would be firmly rejected. Other senior figures have also cautioned that foreign intervention would cross Iran’s security “red lines” and risk wider regional instability.The current protests are the most widespread since the 2022 unrest that followed the death of Mahsa Amini in police custody. Amini, a young woman, had been accused by Iran’s morality police of not wearing her veil properly.","Iran has formally written to the UN Security Council and UN Secretary-General António Guterres.

More than 300,000 inactive university students have been removed from the rolls in Greece, cutting the country's official student population by nearly half, officials said.The move marks the end of a decades-long practice - formally abolished in recent legislation - that allowed extended enrollment to facilitate lifelong learning and lengthy breaks for work. Education ministry said on Friday 308,605 students admitted to state-run universities' four-year degree programmes before 2017 had been removed. ""Student status is not valid for life in any modern European university,"" education minister Sofia Zacharaki said.Opponents say the program failed to address the scale of disruption caused by the financial crisis in previous decade.","More than 300,000 inactive university students have been removed from the rolls in Greece.

Daughter Kim's heir?

The teenage daughter of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un made her first known visit to a sacred family mausoleum, a step that experts say bolstered her status as her father's potential heir. The visit, which occurred on New Year's Day, even sparked speculation that the girl, reportedly named Kim Ju Ae and aged about 13, could be named a high-level official at the upcoming ruling Workers' Party congress.Images carried by the state media on Friday showed Kim Ju Ae standing in the front row with her parents and deeply bowing at Pyongyang's Kumsusan Palace of the Sun in Pyongyang, where the embalmed bodies of her late grandfather and great-grandfather are on display. The palace is ""a place that symbolises legitimacy of the North Korean regime"" and her visit ahead of the Workers' Party congress is a politically orchestrated move, said Cheong Seong-Chang, deputy head of Sejong Institute in South Korea.Kim Jong Un, 41, often marks key state anniversaries by visiting the Kumsusan palace and paying respect to his father Kim Jong Il and grandfather Kim Il Sung.","Kim Ju Ae made her first known visit to a sacred family mausoleum on New Year’s day, sparking speculation that she could be named an official at the upcoming ruling Workers’ Party congress.Images carried by the state media on Friday showed Kim Ju Ae standing in the front row with her parents and deeply bowing at Pyongyang's Kumsusan Palace of the Sun.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126315875,imgsize-31754,width-400,resizemode-4/daughter-kims-heir-visit-to-mausoleum-sparks-buzz.jpg"

Biggest protest in 3 years

Prez acknowledges failings





DUBAI: US President Donald Trump threatened on Friday to come to the aid of protesters in Iran if security forces fire on them, days into unrest that has left several dead and posed the biggest internal threat to Iranian authorities in years.If Iran ""violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue,"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social early Friday morning. ""We are locked and loaded and ready to go.""Ali Larijani, the head of Iran's top security body, said in a post on social media on Friday that Trump ""should know that US interference in this internal matter would mean destabilizing the entire region and destroying America's interests."" He added: ""The American people should know - Trump started this adventurism. They ought to watch over their soldiers."" Iran continues to support groups in Iraq that have previously fired rockets at US forces in the country, as well as the Houthi group that controls much of northern Yemen.Trump did not specify what sort of action the US could take in support of the protests. Washington has long imposed broad financial sanctions on Tehran.US presidents have been wary of engaging militarily in Iran, but in June, Trump ordered airstrikes against Iranian nuclear facilities. A spokesperson for US state department said Washington would ""continue to put maximum pressure on the regime"" in Iran, accusing Iranian authorities of ""squandering billions on terrorist proxies and nuclear weapons research"".Protests erupted across Iran this week amid soaring prices and a collapsing currency that has shaken the economy and pushed many Iranians into deeper economic hardship. The country's currency fell to a record low against the US dollar last weekend, while annual inflation climbed to 42.2% in Dec.The protests have spread across Iran, with deadly confrontations between demonstrators and security forces focused in western provinces. State-affiliated media and rights groups have reported at least six deaths since Wednesday.Iran has seen off repeated bouts of major unrest in recent decades, often quelling protests with heavy security measures and mass arrests. But economic problems may leave authorities more vulnerable now. This week's protests are the biggest in three years, since nationwide demonstrations triggered by the death of a young woman in custody in late 2022 paralysed Iran for weeks, with rights groups reporting hundreds killed.Video verified by Reuters showed dozens of people gathered in front of a burning police station overnight, as gunshots sporadically rang out and people shouted ""shameless, shameless"" at the authorities.In the southern city of Zahedan, where Iran's Baluch minority predominates, the human rights news group Hengaw reported that protesters had chanted slogans including ""Death to the dictator"".Hengaw has reported 29 arrests so far over the unrest, mostly in the west, and including 14 members of Iran's Kurdish minority. State TV also reported the arrest of an unspecified number of people in another western city, Kermanshah, accused of manufacturing petrol bombs and home-made pistols. The deaths acknowledged by official media have been in small western cities of Lordegan and Kuhdasht.During the latest unrest, the elected President Masoud Pezeshkian has struck a conciliatory tone, pledging dialogue with protest leaders over the cost-of-living crisis. Speaking on Thursday, Pezeshkian acknowledged that failings by the authorities were behind the crisis. ""We are to blame... Do not look for America or anyone else to blame. We must serve properly so that people are satisfied with us...,"" he said.",US President Donald Trump threatens to come to the aid of protesters in Iran if security forces fire on them.

Who is Zohran Mamdani

(With input from agencies)





Indian-origin Zohran Mamdani early Thursday was sworn in as New York City's mayor, beginning a four-year term. The 34-year-old Democrat, known for his left-leaning views and criticism of US President Donald Trump, took the oath of office just after midnight at the long-abandoned City Hall subway station beneath Manhattan’s City Hall.Mamdani made history as New York's first Muslim mayor, placing his hand on the Quran during the ceremony. ""This is truly the honour and the privilege of a lifetime,"" he said after being sworn in.The oath was administered by New York Attorney General Letitia James, a close political ally at the historic City Hall station one of the city's original subway stops, famed for its elegant arched ceilings.Mamdani will be sworn in again later on Thursday in a larger public ceremony at City Hall, where US Senator Bernie Sanders, one of his political inspirations, will administer the oath.The event will be followed by a public block party along Broadway’s ""Canyon of Heroes,"" traditionally known for ticker-tape parades.During the mayoral campaign, Trump had threatened to withhold federal funding from New York City if Mamdani won and even floated the idea of deploying National Guard troops.However, the president later surprised both supporters and critics by inviting Mamdani to the White House for what was described as a cordial meeting in November.""I want him to do a great job and will help him do a great job,"" Trump said.Despite this, tensions are expected to resurface given their sharp policy differences, particularly on immigration.Born on October 18, 1991, in Kampala, Uganda, Mamdani is the son of Indian-origin parents and acclaimed filmmaker Mira Nair, known for films such as Salaam Bombay! and Monsoon Wedding, and Mahmood Mamdani, an Indian-born Ugandan academic.He spent part of his early childhood in Cape Town before moving to New York at the age of seven.Mamdani was educated at St George’s Grammar School in Cape Town, Bank Street School for Children, and the Bronx High School of Science. He went on to earn a bachelor’s degree in Africana Studies from Bowdoin College in 2014. While in college, he co-founded Students for Justice in Palestine and later worked on several progressive political campaigns in New York.In 2019, Mamdani won a seat in the New York State Assembly from the 36th District, representing Astoria and Long Island City, where he focused on issues such as housing, transit affordability and immigrant rights, priorities that shaped his mayoral bid.A practising Shia Muslim, Mamdani married Syrian artist Rama Duwaji earlier this year. Her illustrations have appeared in The New Yorker and The Washington Post.The couple will move from their one-bedroom, rent-stabilised apartment in an outer borough to the official mayoral residence in Manhattan.","Indian-origin Zohran Mamdani sworn in as New York City's mayor.
