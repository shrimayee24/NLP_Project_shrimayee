Protesters target Bangladeshi media outlets

(With inputs from agencies)

Ties between India and Bangladesh have hit another roadblock after the killing of youth leader Sharif Osman Hadi in Dhaka sparked anti-India protests. Hadi, a prominent figure in last year’s July uprising in Bangladesh, was killed amid rising political tensions, triggering widespread unrest. Bangladesh government suspended visa services in India following protests outside Bangladeshi missions.Protests also erupted in Bangladesh following the killing of Dipu Chandra Das, a young Hindu man lynched in Mymensingh. Hindu religious organisations and minority rights groups held a demonstration outside the National Press Club in Dhaka on Monday. Protesters described the incident as part of a wider pattern of religious extremism, attacks on minorities and official inaction.Speakers said Dipu Das, a factory worker recently promoted for his dedication, was falsely accused of religious defamation before being brutally killed.India, meanwhile, has raised concerns over the safety of minorities, the security of diplomatic missions, and what it describes as misleading narratives emerging from Bangladesh.Muhammad Yunus held a half-hour phone conversation with US Special Envoy for South and Central Asia Sergio Gor.Yunus used the call to reiterate his pledge to hold general elections on February 12, saying the country was “eagerly waiting” to reclaim voting rights allegedly denied under the previous regime.Sharing the details of the conversation, US Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs said during the call Gor discussed the ""recent events"" in Bangladesh.""Today, Special Envoy for SCA Ambassador Sergio Gor held a productive call with Chief Advisor Yunus @ChiefAdviserGoB to discuss recent events in Bangladesh and shared US interests to advance prosperity through trade,"" US Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs wrote on X.Amid mounting protests, Bangladesh suspended visa services at its High Commission in New Delhi and missions in Tripura and Siliguri, citing unavoidable circumstances. The decision followed demonstrations outside Bangladeshi diplomatic premises, while India had earlier suspended visa services at its Chittagong mission after protesters attempted to storm the compound.Yunus insisted the interim government remained committed to delivering a “free, fair and peaceful” election within roughly 50 days, describing the vote as an opportunity to restore democratic legitimacy. At the same time, he warned that supporters of the ousted Awami League regime were allegedly spending millions to disrupt the electoral process, with a fugitive leader inciting violence from abroad.Inqilab Moncho, the platform Hadi led, issued a 24-hour ultimatum demanding justice, warning that failure to act would trigger a mass movement to oust the interim government. The group demanded a speedy trial tribunal, involvement of international agencies like the FBI and Scotland Yard, and accountability from home and law advisers. Its leaders accused intelligence agencies of failing to identify perpetrators and alleged Awami collaborators were embedded within security structures.Concerns deepened after another leader of the student-led uprising, Motaleb Shikder, was shot in the head in Khulna days after Hadi’s death. Police launched a manhunt but said they remained unclear about the motive or perpetrators. The attack reinforced fears that a coordinated campaign of violence was targeting figures linked to last year’s protests. With multiple leaders injured or killed, questions grew over whether the interim government could guarantee safety during the election period.Earlier on Wednesday, India had summoned Bangladesh’s envoy and expressed strong concern over extremist elements threatening diplomatic missions and minority communities. On December 21, the ministry of external affairs rejected what it called false narratives suggesting security breaches at Bangladesh’s High Commission in Delhi, insisting protests were brief and controlled. New Delhi urged Dhaka to bring perpetrators of the lynching of Hindu man Dipu Chandra Das to justice and said it remained vigilant over minority safety.Bangladesh’s interim government said that it may review the scale of its diplomatic presence in New Delhi if the situation continues to worsen. Foreign affairs adviser M Touhid Hossain's remarks came hours after India dismissed Bangladeshi media reports on protests outside the Bangladesh high commission in New Delhi as “misleading propaganda”.“Regarding the Indian press note, we completely reject it, entirely reject it. The issue has been presented as if it were very simple, whereas in reality it is not,” state-run news agency Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS) quoted Hossain as saying at the media briefing.From exile in India, Sheikh Hasina blamed Yunus entirely for Bangladesh’s instability, accusing the interim government of empowering extremists, failing to protect minorities, and undermining relations with India. She warned that lawlessness under Yunus had damaged Bangladesh’s credibility and endangered regional stability. Hasina claimed radical groups were exploiting Yunus to reshape foreign policy without a mandate, insisting that ties with India would normalise only after legitimate governance was restored. Her remarks added a powerful external voice to an already volatile political landscape.The assassination of Sharif Osman Hadi, shot at close range in Dhaka’s Bijoynagar area and later dying in Singapore, became the catalyst for widespread protests. A key figure in the 'July uprising' that toppled Sheikh Hasina, Hadi’s death sparked anger among supporters who accused the state of inaction. Demonstrations erupted across Dhaka, with calls for accountability growing louder as Yunus declared a national day of mourning. The killing also fuelled fears that political violence was returning just weeks before a pivotal election.The unrest soon spread to Bangladesh’s media houses, with violent mobs attacking the offices of Prothom Alo, The Daily Star, and other outlets in Dhaka. Prothom Alo was forced to halt print publication for the first time in its 27-year history. Yunus condemned the attacks, calling them assaults on truth and press freedom, and pledged full justice. Authorities later said 31 suspects had been identified through video footage, with several arrests made, but the damage to Bangladesh’s democratic image was already significant.","Muhammad Yunus held a half-hour phone conversation with US Special Envoy for South and Central Asia Sergio Gor.

Sheikh Hasina Slams Yunus Over Violence In Bangladesh, Calls Out 'Hostile Statements Against India'

Former Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina reacted to the death of student leader Sharif Usman Hadi, accusing the Muhammad Yunus-led interim government of presiding over “lawlessness” and claiming the violence reflects a breakdown of governance that has worsened since her ouster.In an email interview with ANI, Hasina said the killing of the youth leader underscored a growing culture of violence under the interim administration, warning that the situation was destabilising Bangladesh internally and straining ties with neighbouring countries, particularly India.“This tragic killing reflects the lawlessness that uprooted my government and has multiplied under Yunus. Violence has become the norm while the interim government either denies it or is powerless to stop it. Such incidents destabilise Bangladesh internally but also our relationships with neighbours who are watching with justified alarm. India sees the chaos, the persecution of minorities, and the erosion of everything we built together. When you cannot maintain basic order within your borders, your credibility on the international stage collapses. This is the reality of Yunus's Bangladesh,” Hasina said.Her remarks came after the death of Sharif Osman Hadi, a prominent youth leader associated with Bangladesh’s 2024 “July uprising” and spokesperson of the political platform Inqilab Mancho.Hadi was shot at close range by unidentified assailants while travelling in a rickshaw in Dhaka’s Bijoynagar area on December 12. He sustained a critical gunshot injury to the head and was initially treated at Dhaka Medical College Hospital before being shifted to Evercare Hospital as his condition worsened.He was later airlifted to Singapore for advanced treatment and admitted to the Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit at Singapore General Hospital.Inqilab Mancho announced Hadi’s death in a social media post, stating that he had fought for his life for six days, according to Bangladesh news outlet Daily Star. An aspiring independent candidate from the Dhaka-8 constituency, Hadi emerged as a prominent political figure following last year’s uprising that led to Sheikh Hasina’s removal from office.Hasina also expressed serious concern over the killing of a Hindu youth amid the unrest, linking the incident to what she described as the interim government’s failure to protect minorities and maintain basic law and order.Referring to the lynching of 27-year-old Dipu Chandra Das in Mymensingh district, the former PM held the Yunus-led administration responsible. Das was allegedly beaten to death by a mob over accusations of blasphemy, after which his body was set on fire, triggering nationwide outrage.Hasina said such incidents were contributing to diplomatic strain, particularly with India and accused the interim government of allowing extremists to dictate both domestic and foreign policy.“The strain you are witnessing is entirely of Yunus's making. His government issues hostile statements against India, fails to protect religious minorities, and allows extremists to dictate foreign policy, then expresses surprise when tensions rise. India has been Bangladesh's most steadfast friend and partner for decades. The ties between our nations are deep and fundamental; they will outlast any temporary government,” she said.She further claimed that anti-India hostility was being deliberately fuelled by radical elements emboldened under the current dispensation, pointing to attacks on diplomatic facilities, media houses and minority communities.“This hostility is being manufactured by extremists who have been emboldened by the Yunus regime. These are the same actors who marched on the Indian embassy and attacked our media offices, who attack minorities with impunity, and who forced my family and me to flee for our lives. A responsible government would protect diplomatic missions and prosecute those who threaten them. Instead, Yunus grants immunity to hooligans and calls them warriors,” Hasina alleged.Sheikh Hasina also warned of what she described as the growing influence of radical Islamist forces, claiming the interim government had released convicted terrorists and allowed extremist-linked groups to enter public life, raising alarms about Bangladesh’s secular foundations.""I share this concern, as do the millions of Bangladeshis who prefer the safe, secular state we once were. Yunus has placed extremists in cabinet positions, released convicted terrorists from prison, and allowed groups linked to international terrorist organisations to take roles in public life. He is not a politician and has no experience governing a complex nation. My fear is that radicals are using him to project an acceptable face to the international community while they systematically radicalise our institutions from within,"" Hasina said.Separately, Hasina criticised the interim government’s approach to Pakistan, arguing that major foreign policy shifts were being pursued without democratic legitimacy.She said that Bangladesh had long adhered to a balanced diplomatic principle but accused Yunus of moving hastily to reorient ties after alienating traditional allies.“Bangladesh has always believed in friendship to all, malice toward none. Of course it makes sense for our country to have a stable relationship with Pakistan, but Yunus’ headlong embrace is inappropriate. Having needlessly alienated many of our longstanding allies, he now seems desperate to find a friend on the world stage,” Hasina said.She further stressed that the interim administration lacked the mandate to undertake strategic realignments that could have long-term consequences.“The crucial point is this: Yunus has no mandate to realign Bangladesh's foreign policy. He was not elected, so he has no right to make strategic decisions that could impact generations. Once Bangladeshis can vote freely again, our foreign policy will return to serving our national interests, not the ideological fantasies of extremists who have temporarily seized power. The ties between Bangladesh and India are fundamental and will endure long after this interim government is gone,” she added.","Sheikh Hasina slams interim government over death of student leader Sharif Usman Hadi.

Sajid Akram, one of the two men behind the deadly Bondi Beach attack on December 14, had been homeless and living in a series of short-term Airbnbs across Sydney for at least six months before the massacre, new reports show.Even after his death, his estranged wife has refused to claim his body. Now the government is responsible for burial arrangements, according to 7NewsSydney.The 50-year-old was killed during a shootout with police following the ISIS-inspired attack that claimed 15 lives, including a child, and left dozens injured. His son, 24-year-old Naveed Akram, was apprehended at the scene and remains in hospital under police guard in critical but stable condition.Authorities have confirmed that Sajid Akram had travelled to Davao City in the Philippines from November 1 to November 28, just weeks before the attack. The area is known as a hotspot for Islamic State activity, and police believe he may have undergone military-style training there. Two other men from Sydney who visited the same region at the same time are now under investigation.Before the attack, the father-son duo reportedly told family members they were going on a weekend fishing trip to Jervis Bay.Instead, they opened fire from a pedestrian footbridge near Campbell Parade, targeting participants of the Jewish Chanukah by the Sea festival, as well as locals and tourists in the area. Loud bangs were heard, and people were seen fleeing for their lives.Investigations are ongoing into how the Akram men obtained high-powered weapons. Police discovered improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in the shooters’ vehicle and conducted raids across Sydney, including Naveed Akram’s home in Bonnyrigg. Sajid was originally from Hyderabad and held an Indian passport. He moved to Australia in 1998 and had limited contact with his family back home. His body remains in the morgue in the Coroner's office as of now.The Bondi Beach shooting was treated as an act of terror by the Australian Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese.

Nitish Kumar's Hijab Shocker: BJP MP Giriraj Singh Defends Bihar CM's Act With 'Go To Hell' Remark

NEW DELHI: A woman doctor at the centre of the recent hijab row after Bihar CM Nitish Kumar lifted her naqab during an event did not join duty on Saturday, officials confirmed to news agency PTI. They also reported no contact with her or the family members.Patna civil surgeon Avinash Kumar Singh confirmed that Nusrat Parveen had not reported for duty till 7 pm on Saturday, after which the “possibility window for the day” closed.“I have been informed that the last date of joining has been extended beyond December 20. It remains to be seen whether Parveen joins on Monday or not,” he said, without specifying the new deadline.The controversy erupted earlier this week during an appointment letter distribution programme at the chief minister’s secretariat in Patna. The video circulated widely on social media, capturing the moment Nitish Kumar questioned Parveen’s naqab when she came forward to receive her appointment letter along with other Ayush doctors.Also Read: Hijab row: SCBA issues 'strongest condemnation' over Nitish Kumar's act; seeks unconditional apology from Giriraj Singh, Sanjay Nishad Civil surgeon Singh said he was not aware of the reason for Parveen’s delay, as he “had no contact with her or the family members.”Vijay Kumar, a surgeon at Sabalpur PHC in Patna Sadar, where Parveen was supposed to join, also confirmed she had not reported for duty.“Around five-six people have joined today, and Parveen is not among them... Her name is in the list but we have not received her appointment letter from the civil surgeon office in Patna,” he said. As per protocol, candidates must first report to the civil surgeon’s office before joining their assigned workplace.Meanwhile, governor Arif Mohammad Khan expressed disappointment over the controversy.“It pains me to hear the word ‘dispute’ in this case. Can there be any row between a father and a daughter?” he asked.“What have you people made out of it? This man (Nitish Kumar) considers female students as his daughters,” he added while speaking to reporters in Patna.Earlier, Mahfoozur Rahman, principal of Government Tibbi College & Hospital (GTCH), where Parveen is a second-year student, also suggested the joining deadline had been extended “in this special case”.“Ayush doctor Nusrat Parveen has not joined yet, and there is no update on her future course of action,” Rahman said.According to him, the family wants to avoid media attention. “Her family said that they want to escape media coverage, and that the woman doctor will rethink whether to join or not,” he said.Rahman also dismissed rumours that the family had shifted to Kolkata. “They have themselves rubbished such false news reports,” he said, quoting Parveen’s husband as saying the family is not upset with Nitish Kumar or the government.He added that “the family is disappointed with the row stirred by the media.”Rahman said Parveen last attended college on December 17 or 18 and noted that she still has the option to either join duty or pursue higher education.","Nusrat Parveen had not reported for duty till 7 pm on Saturday, after which the “possibility window for the day” closed.

Murshidabad Tense as Humayun Kabir Faces Heat Over ‘Babri Masjid’ Foundation and Heavy Deployment

Political sparring over new outfit

Babri-style mosque move

NEW DELHI: West Bengal MLA Humayun Kabir on Monday launched his new political party, the Janata Unnayan Party, days after the Trinamool Congress (TMC) suspended him over his decision to lay the foundation stone for a Babri-style mosque in Murshidabad district.Speaking at a public meeting in Beldanga, Kabir said his party will contest the 2026 West Bengal assembly elections. He named eight candidates who will be fielded in the polls, though he did not say how many seats the party will contest in total. ""We can only tell you later how many seats we will be finally contesting,"" he told the gathering during the inauguration.Kabir, who is the MLA from Bharatpur, said he plans to contest from two assembly seats, Rejinagar and Beldanga, in Murshidabad.The ex-Trinamool leader further said he aimed to remove West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee from power in the upcoming assembly elections, which are due in less than six months. Kabir claimed that the chief minister has changed and is no longer accessible to ordinary people.""Mamata Banerjee is no longer the same person I knew. She is beyond the reach of the common man,"" he alleged, challenging her to win even a single seat.""I challenge Mamata Banerjee directly; show me that you can win a single seat.We will reduce Mamata Banerjee's party to zero in Murshidabad,"" Kabir claimed. ""I also want to warn the BJP. If they field candidates in 200 seats, I will show them by winning 100 seats,"" the JUP chief added.Earlier, the suspended MLA had asserted that he would emerge as a “kingmaker” in the 2026 West Bengal Assembly elections. He predicted that neither the ruling TMC nor the BJP would secure a simple majority, estimating that no party would cross the 148-seat mark in the 294-member Assembly.“I will be kingmaker after the elections. No one can form a government without my support,” Kabir said. He further claimed that his new party would contest 135 seats and win enough constituencies to play a decisive role in government formation. “Whoever goes to take oath as the chief minister will need the support of my party’s MLAs,” he added.While the TMC has not reacted directly, chief minister Mamata Banerjee accused the BJP of trying to drive a wedge among Muslims in Bengal while addressing a party meeting in Kolkata.Meanwhile, the BJP has dismissed Kabir’s move with state BJP president Samik Bhattacharya saying Kabir would not have any impact in the elections and accused him of working indirectly to help the TMC return to power.BJP national spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain said, “Humayun Kabir is an agent of the TMC. Mamata Banerjee deliberately got Humayun Kabir to form a party to create polarisation, so that Muslim voters who are unhappy with Mamata do not shift to the opposition but instead move separately. This entire script has been written by Mamata Banerjee.""Kabir was suspended by the TMC on December 4 after his statement on building a Babri-style mosque sparked controversy. Two days later, on December 6, the anniversary of the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992 — Kabir went ahead and laid the foundation stone for the mosque at Rejinagar.Over the past decade, Kabir has been associated with several major political parties in West Bengal. He was expelled by the TMC in 2015 after criticising Mamata Banerjee and alleging that she was promoting her nephew, Abhishek Banerjee. He later contested the 2016 Assembly elections as an independent but lost. He then joined the Congress, before moving to the BJP ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.Kabir contested the Murshidabad Lok Sabha seat on a BJP ticket in 2019 but finished third. He later returned to the TMC and won the Bharatpur Assembly seat in 2021.","West Bengal MLA Humayun Kabir on Monday launched his new political party, the Janata Unnayan Party.

We strongly object to this and will not tolerate it.” Omar held a constitutional post and must exercise restraint while talking on issues linked to faith, he added.Omar had on Saturday questioned the Centre’s move to replace MGNREGA with Viksit Bharat-Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin), or VB-G RAM G, and had also expressed surprise over the nomenclature. “First of all, I am surprised where this name came from,” he said. “Who names a bill as G RAM G?” He also criticised the dropping of Mahatma Gandhi ’s name from the employment scheme.Jasrotia said Omar’s family has had longstanding associations with religious and cultural traditions linked to Lord Ram, and it was unfortunate the CM had forgotten these. His father Farooq Abdullah publicly sang bhajans dedicated to Lord Ram, and the chief minister should respect such tradition in his own family, the spokesperson added.Defending the re-naming, BJP said welfare schemes ensuring dignity of labour and livelihood security were in keeping with Mahatma Gandhi’s ideals. “Gandhiji stood for empowering the weakest sections. Any initiative that guarantees work and food security reflects that vision. If in Gandhi’s time the scheme would be renamed as such, he would have been happy about it,” Jasrotia said.","J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah said the name of the new rural employment guarantee scheme reminded him of Bollywood film ‘Ji Mummy Ji’ BJP on Monday accused him of ridiculing people’s faith.

‘Do Namune’ Dig By Yogi Adityanath Ignites UP Assembly Clash, Akhilesh Accuses BJP Of Decorum Breach

What were the protests about?

NEW DELHI: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday took a veiled dig at Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi during a state Assembly session, saying “” (There are two specimens in the country).The remarks came amid a heated debate in the Assembly over the alleged illegal trade of codeine-based cough syrup, prompting strong protests from the SP and noisy demonstrations inside and outside the House.Speaking during the winter session, Adityanath said, “ 'Desh ke andar do namune hain'. One sits in Delhi and the other in Lucknow. When there is any discussion in the country, they immediately flee the country, and I think the same thing is happening with your ‘Babua’. He will also leave the country again for a trip to England, and you people will keep shouting here.”The remarks came in response to opposition questions on deaths allegedly caused by codeine syrup, though UP CM did not name them explicitly.He categorically denied any fatalities due to the syrup in Uttar Pradesh: “No deaths have occurred in Uttar Pradesh due to codeine cough syrup. Secondly, action will be taken in this case under the NDPS Act.The Uttar Pradesh government has won this case in court.”Yogi added that the biggest wholesaler first apprehended by the STF had been licensed during the Samajwadi Party’s tenure in 2016.Giving an update on enforcement, the chief minister said, “The government has registered 79 cases, named 225 accused and arrested 78 people. Raids have been conducted on 134 firms. No accused in this case will escape, and preparations will also be made for bulldozer action when the time comes.” He also suggested that a deeper investigation may reveal links to the Samajwadi Party.""I think if you delve deeper into this matter, you'll find that ultimately, some leader or individual associated with the Samajwadi Party is involved. The High Court has ruled that this entire case should be prosecuted under the NDPS Act. The Uttar Pradesh government has fought this battle and won."" he stated.The remarks drew strong reactions from Akhilesh Yadav. He criticised the public spat between leaders and the use of personal attacks in political discourse.In a post on X, Samajwadi chief wrote: “Self-Acceptance! No one expected the Delhi-Lucknow feud to escalate to this point. People holding constitutional positions should at least maintain some public decorum and not cross the bounds of propriety. BJP folks should not bring their party’s internal squabbles out to the crossroads.”Earlier, Akhilesh had alleged that the codeine racket originated from the Prime Minister’s parliamentary constituency.“A state’s chief minister lies, and those standing with him also lie. You can’t imagine that an illegal cough syrup business is operating from the Prime Minister’s parliamentary constituency… it’s worth thousands of crores. This is an international issue,” he said. Yadav called for strict bulldozer-style action against all “mafias,” irrespective of political affiliation.Earlier today, Samajwadi Party members held demonstrations outside the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly. The protest came amid outrage over the alleged illegal trade of codeine-based cough syrup and what the party described as government inaction.SP legislators, including both MLAs and council members, staged a sit-in near the main gate of Vidhan Bhavan, holding placards with anti-government slogans and demanding strict action against those involved in the syrup racket.During the protest, SP members raised slogans against UP CM, alleging that people from his own caste and close associates were involved in the illegal trade. The party accused the government of prioritizing profits over public health and youth welfare.A statement from the Samajwadi Party media cell on X read: ""Chief Minister Adityanath is running the business of poisonous and intoxicating cough syrup. People from his own caste and his close associates are involved in the illegal trade. Is their greed for money so intense that the deaths of children and addiction among youth have no effect on them? What kind of yogis are these who have gone to such extremes for money? How do they call themselves honest with what face? Is this their yoga, this their saintliness, and this their so-called honesty?""SP legislators also raised other issues during the protest, including alleged manipulation of voter lists, curtailment of reservation rights, and collapse of health services.The Uttar Pradesh police said a Special Investigation Team is probing the illegal network involved in storage and distribution of regulated codeine-based cough syrups, including financial transactions and cross-border links to Nepal and Bangladesh.",Yogi Adityanath took a veiled dig at Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi during a state Assembly session.

LUCKNOW: UP CM Yogi Adityanath Monday blamed Congress and Muhammad Ali Jinnah for India's ""cultural division"" and Partition, saying the compromise made over "" Vande Mataram "" was the first and most dangerous outcome of Congress' appeasement politics.Initiating a discussion on Vande Mataram in the Assembly on second day of the winter session, the CM said the compromise made by Congress over Vande Mataram gave rise to separatism. He also said the opposition to ""Vande Mataram"" was neither religious nor faith-based but purely political.The UP assembly became the first House to take up the discussion on ""Vande Mataram"".

Was this the result of some religious compulsion, or was it a well-planned conspiracy to mortgage national consciousness in order to cling to power?),"" Yogi said.The CM claimed that as long as Jinnah was in Congress, ""Vande Mataram"" was not a point of contention. ""Once Jinnah left the Congress, he made it a tool of the Muslim League and deliberately gave the song a communal colour. The song remained the same, but the agenda changed,"" Yogi said.","Yogi Adityanath blamed Congress and Muhammad Ali Jinnah for India's ""cultural division"" and Partition.

RAIPUR: BJP national president JP Nadda alleged Monday that ""people from within Congress"" had colluded with Maoist insurgents to engineer the 2013 Jhiram Ghati massacre in Chhattisgarh that killed 32 people, including senior party functionaries. His remarks triggered a Congress demand for an NIA probe and a public apology.Addressing a Janadesh Parab rally in Janjgir-Champa district, Nadda said he was heading BJP's Chhattisgarh unit at the time of the ambush on May 25, 2013, and had tracked developments closely. ""Let me say this with full responsibility: no one else was giving information and inside details about the Jhiram valley case. People from within were involved in getting their own people killed and were in contact with the Naxalites,"" he alleged. ""When protectors turn predators, the common people suffer the most,"" he added.Maoists attacked a convoy of Congress functionaries returning from the party's Parivartan Yatra between Sukma and Jagdalpur on that day. Among those killed were then state Congress chief Nand Kumar Patel, former opposition leader Mahendra Karma, and former Union minister Vidyacharan Shukla.Nadda accused previous Congress govts of compromising with Maoists, contrasting that with what he called decisive action by ""double-engine"" BJP govts at Centre and in Chhattisgarh.He said nearly 2,500 Maoists had surrendered over the past two years, 1,853 had been arrested, and top commanders such as Madvi Hidma and Basavaraju had been killed.Under PM Narendra Modi and CM Vishnu Deo Sai, the push to eliminate Maoist insurgency had gathered unprecedented momentum, he said. Left-wing extremism in Chhattisgarh would be ""finished by March 2026"", Nadda asserted, saying state authorities were firmly executing the Centre's security-and-development plan on ground.Congress hit back sharply. Chhattisgarh Congress functionary Sushil Anand Shukla called the allegations ""objectionable"" and demanded proof.""Congress demands that NIA question Nadda over his claim. He has torn apart all limits of political decorum. He must apologise and BJP should act against him for this statement,"" Shukla said, adding that making such charges without evidence was ""an insult to the martyrs"".","JP Nadda: ""People from within Congress"" colluded with Maoist insurgents to engineer the 2013 Jhiram Ghati massacre in Chhattisgarh.

New Video Reveals Final Moments of Hindu Man Dipu Before Lynching in Bangladesh

DEHRADUN: Late in the evening on Dec 18, when a co-worker called Apu Chandra Das to say that his elder brother had been taken by a mob, the 22-year-old didn't immediately understand. ""Taken where?"" he had asked. But by the time the full story reached him, Dipu Chandra Das — 28 years old, a Hindu garment factory worker, husband, father of a one-year-old, and the only breadwinner for a family of eight — had already been lynched, hung from a tree, and burned. The video of his body on fire had gone viral. The police had not yet retrieved it.""What happened to my brother was beyond imagination,"" Apu told TOI, his voice catching, over the phone from Mymensingh district in Bangladesh. ""Not even animals are treated the way that a violent mob of around 140 people pounced on my brother.""Four days have passed since the killing. The police have made arrests. Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), the country's elite counter-terrorism agency, has said they found no evidence to support the allegation that Dipu posted any blasphemous content online — the rumour that triggered the attack. And yet, for Dipu's family, there is no closure, no respite.But more than that, they are scared.Dipu worked at Pioneer Knitwears (BD) Ltd, a garment factory in the Bhaluka area of Mymensingh. On the night of Dec 18, around 9pm, a mob arrived at the factory. Apu was told that they dragged Dipu out, beat him with bamboo sticks, fists and kicks until he died. His body was then taken along the road to Jamirdia square, where they hung him from a tree and set the dead man ablaze in full public view.Police reached later, by which time a crowd had surrounded the burning body. ""They had to break through the mob to even retrieve him,"" Apu said. The body was taken to a hospital morgue and returned to the family which lodged a police complaint the next day.But even then, the family says, they were not allowed dignity. ""A group of people didn't allow family members to get the last glimpse of my brother before his cremation,"" Apu said. ""We were forced to take the body immediately to the cremation ground for his last rites. My elderly parents are completely heartbroken.""The mob had accused Dipu of insulting Islam in a social media post — a charge that triggered the violence. Apu said his brother was incapable of such a thing. ""He could never have posted anything objectionable...he always respected all religions.""That claim is now supported by RAB, which is investigating the case. A senior RAB official confirmed that ""no evidence of any such post on social media by Dipu"" was found. The agency is also probing the possibility that misinformation was deliberately circulated to incite communal violence.Twelve people have so far been arrested. On Monday, they were produced before a local court, which granted police a three-day remand to question them. More arrests are likely, officers said, as digital evidence is being analysed and the network behind the false content is traced.Apu himself works as a casual labourer and has no fixed income. The complaint in the case was formally filed by him on Dec 19 at Bhaluka Model police station, the day after the murder. He says the authorities have assured him justice will be served, but admits that the violence, and the silence that followed from many in their community, has left him shaken. ""We've been told justice will be done,"" he said. ""But after what we saw — after how easily a mob could do this — how can we believe that? ""We don't even know how to live anymore. ""","Dipu Chandra Das, 28, was lynched, hung from a tree, and burned in Bangladesh. The mob had accused Dipu of insulting Islam in a social media post.

The accused were arrested on Monday.The spine-chilling crime brought back memories of the ""blue drum murder"" in which a woman called Muskan and her lover Sahil stabbed ex-merchant navy officer Saurabh Rajput to death in Meerut on March 4. They then bought two knives to cut the body into pieces and put the remains inside a drum, sealing it with cement. They later went on holiday to the hills.Sambhal SP Krishan Kant Bishnoi said, ""On Nov 18, Ruby (30), a housewife, filed a missing complaint at Chandausi police station, citing that her husband, 32, had gone missing.On Dec 15, we found a torso. The hands and legs were missing. Later, we found a polythene packet containing a human head in a drain. While examining the body parts, we saw the name ‘Rahul' inked on the chest.""Bishnoi added: ""Police stations across several districts were requested for information on Ruby's complaint. Eventually, we called her for identification of the body parts, but she refused and disappeared, raising suspicion. Called for questioning, she confessed.""In her confession, Ruby said: ""On the night Rahul caught me and Gaurav in a compromising position, he started assaulting us in a fit of rage. He threatened that he would defame me and throw me out of the house. At that moment, I told Gaurav to finish him off, and he struck Rahul on the head with an iron rod, while I hit him with a metal shoe-hammer, killing him on the spot.""Ruby further said, ""On Nov 18, we brought a grinder tool and cut his body into parts and put these in bags. On the same day, we hired a vehicle and dumped one bag containing the severed head and legs, along with Rahul's mobile phone, into the Ganga at Rajghat.""""Later that night, we threw the other bag in a drain near the idgah on Patraua Road, and burnt Rahul's lower garment, and the blood-stained clothes of Gaurav and mine.

AHMEDABAD: Vadaj police in Ahmedabad arrested a 21-year-old man on Monday for allegedly killing a cat in a brutal manner after it reportedly attacked his six-month-pregnant wife when she offered it milk on Sunday. The incident came to light after a disturbing video of the act went viral on social media, triggering widespread outrage among residents and animal welfare activists.According to police, the accused Rahul Dantani, allegedly lost his temper after the cat attacked his 20-year-old pregnant wife on Sunday. Following the attack she reportedly developed health complications and had to consult a doctor.

The cat was then pulled out and pinned down, with one of the accused placing his leg on its neck while another repeatedly struck it with a large stone. The footage also shows the accused kicking the animal and posing for photographs beside it. The cat died on the spot due to severe injuries.After the video was circulated on social media, Viral Patel, a volunteer with an animal welfare organisation, approached Vadaj police and lodged a complaint.Police rushed to the location and found the cat dead.Based on the complaint, Vadaj police registered an FIR under Section 325 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) for killing an animal and Section 11(1)(l) of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act.""Taking cognisance of the viral video, a case was registered and a team was formed to trace the accused.

(With agency inputs)

GUWAHATI: Amid rising tensions in Assam’s West Karbi Anglong district, authorities have imposed Section 163 of the Bhartiya Nyay Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) to maintain public order and protect life and property.A prohibitory order issued by the District Magistrate of Karbi Anglong, Nirola Phangchopi, enforces Section 163 of the BNSS from December 22, 2025, until further notice to prevent ""anti-social elements"" from causing ethnic or communal disturbances and to protect public life and property.Under the order, gatherings of five or more people are strictly prohibited. There is a total restriction on the movement of people and private vehicles from 5:00pm to 6:00am. The order also bars rallies, picketing, ""Mashal"" (torch) processions, or dharnas in public places, as well as carrying firearms or setting off firecrackers. It prohibits any inflammatory or anti-national speeches, posters, or wall writing, and no use of loudspeakers or microphones without prior permission.Police, military, and officials on duty are exempt from these movement restrictions. People with medical emergencies may move freely.Schools, colleges, universities (for exams), and government or private offices will continue to function as usual.Assam minister Dr Ranoj Pegu and Assam DGP Harmeet Singh visited the area to assess the situation.The escalation followed protesters, holding sit-in demonstrations demanding the eviction of illegal encroachers from the Village Grazing Reserve (VGR) and Professional Grazing Reserve (PGR) lands, setting the house of the Chief Executive Member (CEM) of the Karbi Anglong Autonomous Council (KAAC) on fire. The incident took place in Dongkamukam near Kheroni in the West Karbi Anglong district.Three protesters and a few security personnel were injured following clashes. Protesters pelted stones and attacked security forces, prompting cops to blank fire to control the situation.A senior police official of West Karbi Anglong said additional security personnel have been deployed to restore order.Akhilesh Kumar Singh, IGP (Law & Order), told news agency ANI, ""We are mobilising extra forces to bring the situation to normalcy. The mob also set ablaze the residence of the CEM of Karbi Anglong Autonomous Council. Some security personnel got minor injuries, and we are collecting the data.""Reports indicate the situation turned violent after police on Monday morning detained a few protesters, prompting a large crowd to block roads, march towards Dongkamukam, and set ablaze the ancestral residence of KAAC CEM Tuliram Ronghang.Meanwhile, the mob damaged several houses, a school bus, and other structures in a basti area near Dongkamukam. Senior police officials have rushed to the site.The protest stems from a long-standing demand to evict settlers from PGR and VGR lands. Although KAAC issued eviction notices in February 2024, a petition in the Gauhati high court has stalled the process, citing concerns over contempt of court.","Authorities have imposed Section 163 of the Bhartiya Nyay Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) to maintain public order and protect life and property.

‘Damn Gringos’: Petro Condemns US Threats After Trump Links Colombia to Cocaine Trafficking





US President Donald Trump issued a sharp warning to Colombian President Gustavo Petro, using harsh words over cocaine trafficking into the United States. The remarks come as Washington’s tensions with Latin American country deepens, following its ongoing standoff with Venezuela.Speaking on Monday from his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, Trump accused Colombia of allowing drug production and exports to the US, directly targeting Petro’s leadership.“He has to watch because he’s got drug factories. He’s no friend to the United States,” Trump said.Trump’s remarks mark an escalation in a months-long feud between the two leaders, with the US administration intensifying pressure on Colombia through threats of sanctions and even military action, as reported by Axios.“We love the Colombian people, but their new leader is a troublemaker, and he better watch it,” Trump told reporters later on Monday.Claiming Colombia has at least three major cocaine manufacturing facilities, Trump said US authorities are aware of their locations. “We know where they are. He better close them up fast,” he added.Colombia has historically been one of Washington’s closest allies in Latin America.However, relations have deteriorated since Petro, the country’s first leftist president, took office in 2022.Petro is seen as an ally of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, another frequent target of Trump’s criticism.The latest exchange follows earlier warnings by Trump that countries sending illegal drugs into the US could face military strikes.Speaking during a cabinet meeting earlier this month, Trump said, “Anybody that’s doing that and selling it into our country is subject to attack,” referring to cocaine shipments from Colombia. These comments came as the US military continues missile strikes on alleged drug-trafficking vessels in the Caribbean and Pacific.Petro has strongly pushed back against Trump’s accusations, accusing Washington of threatening Colombia’s sovereignty. In a post on X, he said that Colombia destroys a drug-production laboratory every 40 minutes “without missiles” and invited Trump to witness the operations himself.“Come to Colombia, Mr. Trump… but do not threaten our sovereignty, because you will awaken the Jaguar,” Petro wrote. He also warned that any attack on Colombia would amount to a declaration of war.Petro has also accused the Trump administration of violating international norms. In September, he said the US breached the United Nations ’ “founding principles” after the State Department announced it would revoke his visa.A month later, Petro alleged that US forces bombed a Colombian boat carrying civilians during operations targeting suspected drug smugglers near Venezuela.The dispute is unfolding amid rising regional tensions, with the US increasing its naval presence in the Caribbean while accusing Venezuela of enabling drug flows into the United States. Maduro has denied the claims, but Trump has repeatedly suggested that US intervention in Venezuela remains an option.Earlier this month, Trump widened his warning beyond Caracas. “I hear the country of Colombia is making cocaine… and then they sell us their cocaine,” he said.Petro responded with renewed caution, stating, “Do not threaten our sovereignty, or you will awaken the Jaguar. Attacking our sovereignty is declaring war. Attacking our sovereignty is declaring war; do not damage two centuries of diplomatic relations.”","US President Donald Trump warns Colombian President Gustavo Petro.

US diplomacy shakeup? Trump recalls 30 career diplomats from ambassadorial embassy posts; here's why,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-diplomacy-shakeup-trump-recalls-30-career-diplomats-from-ambassadorial-embassy-posts-heres-why/articleshow/126133146.cms,"(File photo)

Trump Immigration Offensive SHOCK Reveal; Workplace Raids, Expanded Detention Incoming Next Year

An ‘unprecedented’ recall of career ambassadors

White House defence and ‘America First’ rationale





The Trump administration has quietly ordered the recall of nearly 30 career diplomats serving as ambassadors and chiefs of mission across the world, triggering alarm within the US foreign service and renewed accusations of a political purge inside the State Department. The move, reported by various US media outlets, is highly unusual and has not been publicly announced by the administration.Those affected are all career Foreign Service officers who were nominated during the Biden administration and confirmed by the Senate. Unlike political appointees, career ambassadors are typically retained across changes in government to preserve continuity and maintain an apolitical diplomatic corps. Many were told abruptly, often by phone, to vacate their posts by mid-January, with no explanation provided.The mass recall comes even as President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he wants to resolve global conflicts through diplomacy, raising questions about the impact on US influence abroad.According to the American Foreign Service Association (AFSA), the union representing US diplomats, this is the first time such a large group of career ambassadors has been recalled simultaneously.AFSA said it had received “credible reports” from diplomatic posts worldwide that senior envoys had been directed to return to Washington within weeks.Former diplomats described the process as chaotic and opaque. One former senior official said ambassadors were being pulled “randomly”, with no clarity on why some were recalled while others were spared. AFSA warned that the lack of transparency broke sharply with long-standing norms and sent a troubling signal to both allies and public servants.Africa has been the hardest-hit region, with roughly a dozen ambassadors recalled from countries including Nigeria, Senegal, Uganda, Rwanda, Niger and Somalia. Other recalls have affected posts in Europe, the Middle East and Eurasia, including Egypt, Algeria, Slovakia and Armenia. The removals will leave dozens of US embassies without a Senate-confirmed ambassador at a time when China continues to expand its diplomatic footprint worldwide.The State Department has defended the move as routine. A senior official said an ambassador is the personal representative of the president and that Trump has the right to ensure envoys advance his “America First” agenda. The official confirmed the diplomats would not be fired but reassigned, though many face retirement if no new posting is found within a limited window.Secretary of State Marco Rubio has linked the reshuffle to broader changes in promotion criteria and departmental reorganisation, including a push to roll back Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies. Rubio said hundreds of diplomats had been newly nominated for promotion under revised rules overseen by adjusted panels.Critics, however, argue the changes are designed to elevate officials seen as politically aligned with the White House. Powerful figures such as deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller have openly sought to reshape the State Department to support stricter immigration policies and a more ideological foreign policy.The recall has deepened an already severe morale crisis within the foreign service. AFSA recently released survey results showing 98% of respondents reported declining morale since Trump’s second term began in January. Many cited shrinking budgets, heavier workloads and reduced US foreign aid. Only 1% said conditions had improved.Earlier this year, the department announced around 1,300 layoffs, including more than 240 Foreign Service officers, as part of what Rubio described as a reorganisation. Several senior diplomats, many of them women or people of colour, also lost previously assigned overseas leadership roles.","The move is highly unusual and has not been publicly announced by the administration.

Who is Jeff Landry?

Trump Greenland claims







The Prime Ministers of Denmark and Greenland, in a stance against US President Donald Trump 's appointment of a special envoy, demanded respect for their territorial integrity. They insisted that the US won't take over Greenland and that the sovereignty of the nation is rooted in international law.""We have said it before. Now, we say it again. National borders and the sovereignty of states are rooted in international law,"" Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and her Greenlandic counterpart, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, said in a joint statement. ""They are fundamental principles. You cannot annex another country. Not even with an argument about international security.""Trump, on Sunday, announced the appointment of Louisiana governor Jeff Landry as a special envoy to Greenland. This has added fuel to the ongoing tensions regarding Trump's intention of the US annexation of the land. Denmark's foreign minister, on Monday, told Danish broadcasters that he would summon the US ambassador to his ministry.Further in the statement, Frederiksen's office stated, ""Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders and the US shall not take over Greenland. We expect respect for our joint territorial integrity.""The governor of Louisiana, Jeff Landry, has been appointed as the special envoy to Greenland by Trump. While the exact scope of the role is yet unclear, Jeff shall still be holding the governor's office.Landry is a conservative fighter who, before winning the governor's race, was appointed as Louisiana's attorney general in 2016. Throughout his time in office, he became a frequent legal adversary of Democratic leadership, launching numerous courtroom challenges against the agendas of both the Biden administration and his predecessor, John Bel Edwards, including pandemic vaccine mandates, environmental regulations, etc.Being a staunch Trump supporter, Landry had also applauded the deployment of border patrol agents in New Orleans. The mission, known as Operation Catahoula Crunch (or ""Swamp Sweep""), set a target of 5,000 arrests of individuals without permanent legal status. Landry framed the move as a necessary strike against ""criminal illegal aliens,"" The operation sparked intense backlash for its heavy-handed approach and reports of aggressive tactics.In June 2025, Landry led a Louisiana delegation to the International Paris Air Show to boost the state’s aerospace industry and attract global investment.While Landry has little formal history with the Danish government, President Trump recently appointed him as the U.S. Special Envoy to Greenland. Landry described the volunteer role as a mission to ""make Greenland a part of the U.S.,"" sparking a diplomatic row with Denmark. This move follows Trump’s pattern of using personal loyalists to manage unconventional international priorities.Announcing the appointment of the envoy on Truth Social on Sunday, Trump went on to say that Jeff understands the importance of Greenland for the US' national security and shall be extending the US's interest.Later on Monday, reiterating the security claims, Trump said the US needed Greenland ""not for minerals"" and claimed Russian and Chinese vessels were operating extensively in the region, and said Landry would ""lead the charge.""""We need Greenland for national security,"" Trump told reporters on Monday, ""And if you take a look at Greenland, you look up and down the coast, you have Russian and Chinese ships all over the place.""In the initial months of his second term, Trump had expressed a strong interest in taking over the largely self-governing island territory. In August, Danish officials summoned the top US diplomat in Copenhagen following a report that at least three people with connections to Trump had carried out covert influence operations in Greenland.As The Guardian reports, according to a poll in January, the vast majority of Greenland’s 57,000 inhabitants want to become independent from Denmark but have no wish to become part of the US. The territory has had the right to declare independence since 2009.","Denmark and Greenland insist that the US won't take over Greenland and that the sovereignty of the nation is rooted in international law.

Restrictions on semiautomatic firearms: Trump administration sues Washington DC over gun laws; cites Second Amendment violations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/restrictions-on-semiautomatic-firearms-trump-administration-sues-washington-dc-over-gun-laws-cites-second-amendment-violations/articleshow/126131915.cms,"(Photo credit: Agencies)

(With input from agencies)





Donald Trump-led US administration is suing the Washington, DC, government over its gun laws, arguing that restrictions on certain semiautomatic firearms violate the Second Amendment rights. The US Department of Justice filed the lawsuit on Monday in the District Court for the District of Columbia, naming the Metropolitan Police Department and outgoing police chief Pamela Smith as defendants.The case sets up a major legal battle over how far governments can go in regulating individual gun ownership.""The United States of America brings this lawsuit to protect the rights that have been guaranteed for 234 years and which the Supreme Court has explicitly reaffirmed several times over the last two decades,""the Justice Department said in its filing.This is the second gun-rights lawsuit filed by the administration this month. Earlier, the Justice Department sued the US Virgin Islands, alleging the territory was ""obstructing and systematically denying"" citizens the right to possess and carry firearms.The lawsuit also marks another flashpoint in ongoing tensions between the federal government and the District of Columbia. The Trump administration launched a law enforcement intervention in the capital over the summer to curb crime, a move that DC’s attorney general is now challenging in court, including the deployment of the National Guard.The Justice Department argues that Washington, DC, is enforcing unconstitutional bans on AR-15-style rifles and other semiautomatic weapons that it says are protected under the Supreme Court’s 2008 Heller ruling.That landmark case, which also arose from a challenge to DC gun laws, held that individuals have a right to own firearms ""in common use today,"" independent of militia service.""There seems to us no doubt, on the basis of both text and history, that the Second Amendment conferred an individual right to keep and bear arms,"" the court ruled at the time, while adding that ""the right was not unlimited.”According to the Justice Department, the District has exceeded those limits. The lawsuit claims DC bars residents from registering widely used firearms and then penalises them criminally for possessing unregistered weapons.""Specifically, the District denies law-abiding citizens the ability to register a wide variety of commonly used semi-automatic firearms, such as the Colt AR-15 series rifles, which is among the most popular of firearms in America,"" the filing states.The department further argues that DC's restrictions are arbitrary. ""DC's current semi-automatic firearms prohibition that bans many commonly used pistols, rifles or shotguns is based on little more than cosmetics, appearance, or the ability to attach accessories,"" it says, and fails to consider whether the weapons are ""in common use today"" for lawful purposes.Unlike the Heller case, the current lawsuit does not include individual DC residents as plaintiffs. Instead, the administration says it has the authority to challenge the city’s laws under the federal crime law enacted in 1994.The Metropolitan Police Department declined to comment on the case, saying it does not discuss pending litigation.","Donald Trump-led US administration is suing the Washington, DC, government over its gun laws.

Trump Survives Aerial Attack? U.S. & Canada Deploy Fighters After Plane Breaches Mar-A-Lago Airspace

.





US President Donald Trump unveiled plans for a new class of Navy battleships, labeled the “Trump class”. He said the vessels would replace an “old, tired and obsolete” American fleet and help maintain US military supremacy.Making the announcement on Monday from his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, Trump said, “They’ll help maintain American military supremacy, revive the American shipbuilding industry, and inspire fear in America’s enemies all over the world.”The decision was made in the presence of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio Trump further added that the battleships would form part of a broader naval modernisation drive called the “Golden Fleet,” aimed at countering China and other adversaries while reviving the US shipbuilding industry.Flanked by artistic renderings of the ships at sea, Trump said he would take an active role in their design along with the US Navy, citing his personal interest in aesthetics. “I’m a very aesthetic person,” he said.“They’ll help maintain American military supremacy, revive the American shipbuilding industry, and inspire fear in America’s enemies all over the world,” he added.According to the president, the new battleships will be the largest ever built, weighing between 30,000 and 40,000 tonnes each and constructed entirely in the United States.He said they would be equipped with advanced weaponry, including hypersonic weapons, electric rail guns, cruise missiles, sophisticated laser systems and what he described as top-tier guns and missiles. Trump also said the ships would be AI-controlled.Initially, the US Navy is expected to build two of the new battleships, followed by eight more. Trump said he ultimately envisioned a fleet of 20 to 25 such vessels, calling them the future “flagship of the American naval fleet.”“We envision that these ships will be the first of a whole new class of ships to be produced in the years to come,” he said.Trump added that existing US aircraft carriers would also be upgraded as part of the Golden Fleet initiative.The president has previously criticised the design of some US naval vessels, arguing that functionality should not come at the cost of appearance. Speaking earlier this year at Quantico, he said he disliked the look of certain ships built for stealth purposes.“They say, ‘Oh, it’s stealth.’ I say that’s not stealth. An ugly ship is not necessary in order to say you’re stealth,” he had remarked.Naming a class of warships after Trump could eventually result in an active naval vessel bearing his name, though such a development would likely take years. Traditionally, a ship class is named after the first vessel produced under that design, which would imply the possibility of a USS Trump. However, posters displayed at Monday’s event showed the ship named USS Defiant.The announcement comes amid heightened US naval activity in the Caribbean Sea, where Washington has increased pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, including efforts to disrupt his country’s oil exports.The US Navy, alongside the Coast Guard, has been involved in a series of interdictions of oil tankers in the region. Earlier this month, two tankers were intercepted off Venezuela’s coast. On Sunday, the Coast Guard said it was in “active pursuit” of the tanker Bella 1 after it refused to comply with US seizure efforts.While the status of that pursuit remained unclear on Monday, US officials said the tanker’s decision to turn away from Venezuela without loading oil was itself considered a success.Last week, the Navy also announced plans to commission a new class of US-built frigates designed to protect sea lanes and support larger vessels.","US President Donald Trump unveiled plans for a new class of Navy battleships, labeled the “Trump class” He said the vessels would replace an “old, tired and obsolete” American fleet and help maintain US military supremacy.

US President Donald Trump on Monday (local time) said the release of investigative files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein risks damaging the reputations of people who had “innocently met” him in the past, as the Justice Department began making the material public, AFP reported.Speaking to reporters at his Mar a Lago residence in Palm Beach, Donald Trump dismissed the renewed focus on Epstein as a political distraction. “This whole thing with Epstein is a way of trying to deflect from the tremendous success that the Republican Party has,” he said.Trump made the remarks after former US president Bill Clinton featured prominently in the first batch of photographs released from the Epstein files. Asked about Clinton, Trump said, “I like Bill Clinton. I've always gotten along with Bill Clinton. I hate to see photos come out of him.”“There’s photos of me too,” Trump added. “Everybody was friendly with this guy (Epstein).”The Republican president said he opposed the release of such images, calling it a “terrible thing.” “Bill Clinton’s a big boy, he can handle it,” he said.Trump warned that the disclosures could unfairly harm others who had no involvement in Epstein’s crimes.“But you probably have pictures being exposed of other people that innocently met Jeffrey Epstein years ago, many years ago, and they’re highly respected bankers and lawyers and others,” he said.He added that many people were upset about the release of the photographs. “A lot of people are very angry that pictures are being released of other people that really had nothing to do with Epstein. But they're in a picture with him because he was at a party and you ruin a reputation of somebody,” Trump said.Epstein, a wealthy financier with extensive political and social connections, died in a New York jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.

Vice president JD Vance once again stirred a row after asserting at the Turning Point USA AmericaFest event that the United States is and always will be a Christian nation.Speaking to the mostly Republican crowd, Vance said, “The only thing that is truly served as an anchor of the United States of America is that we have been, and by the grace of God, we always will be, a Christian nation. ” The MAGA audience responded with loud applause and cheers.The remarks come after Vance said in October that he hopes his wife, Usha Vance, who was raised in a Hindu family may convert into Christianity. Speaking at one older Turning Point USA event, Vance said he hopes she may one day embrace Christianity, but said that faith must be freely chosen. He had said: “Now most Sundays Usha will come with me to church… Do I hope, eventually, that she is somehow moved by the same thing that I was moved in by church? Yeah, I honestly do wish that because I believe in the Christian gospel and I hope eventually my wife comes to see it the same way. ”These comments had ignited a firestorm within the MAGA base and divided conservatives on how a White nationalist Christian leader can have a Brown Hindu and Indian wife.Democrats, progressives, and American Hindu groups condemned the statements and said they were insensitive to Usha’s religious identity and showed elements of forceful Christian nationalist rhetoric.

"'Trump had nothing to do with Epstein files': DOJ defends redacting US president’s photo, then republishes it",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-had-nothing-to-do-with-epstein-files-doj-defends-redacting-us-presidents-photo-then-republishes-it/articleshow/126109922.cms,"Trump's DOJ Under Fire: 16 Files 'GO MISSING' From Epstein Library Within 24 Hours Of Release





US deputy attorney General Todd Blanche has insisted that the Justice Department’s decision to remove over a dozen photographs from the recent release of Jeffrey Epstein files “has nothing to do with President [Donald] Trump. ”He said the move came at the request of victim advocacy groups, according to NBC News.The photos were re-released by the DOJ. In a post on X, the department said: ""The Southern District of New York flagged an image of President Trump for potential further action to protect victims.""It added: ""Out of an abundance of caution, the Department of Justice temporarily removed the image for further review. After the review, it was determined there is no evidence that any Epstein victims are depicted in the photograph, and it has been reposted without any alteration or redaction.""Blanche explained that the photographs were taken down on Saturday only temporarily and included un-redacted images of women. “The photo will go back up” once Justice Department officials complete their review and determine whether further redactions are needed.On Saturday, NBC News confirmed that 15 images released on Friday had been removed from the department’s website.One of the removed files included a photo of a tabletop covered in framed pictures of Epstein with famous individuals, including printed photos of Trump with women in bathing suits inside an open drawer. “Blanche told NBC News’ Meet the Press on Sunday DOJ is still investigating that particular photo: ""We don’t have perfect information.And so when, when we hear from victims-rights groups about this type of photograph, we pull it down and investigate. We’re still investigating that photo. The photo will go back up, and the only question is whether there will be redactions on the photo.”Blanche also pushed back against criticism from Democrats over the Justice Department’s partial release of the Epstein files on Friday, which was the deadline under the Epstein Files Transparency Act set 30 days ago. He said delays were necessary to protect victims and their privacy.Lawmaker Ro Khanna was disappointed with the partial release and called on Blanche and Attorney General Pam Bondi to agree on the full release. Dick Durbin and Shri Thanedar criticised the department for violating the law and condemned the lack of transparency initially promised by MAGA base.Republican Thomas Massie called the removal of documents “government lies,” while former Trump aide Marjorie Taylor Greene criticised the slow release, posting that it was “NOT MAGA.”Blanche pushed back against all claims of a cover-up. “I have no reason to believe that the lawyers that were working on this case were talking about President Trump, because he had nothing to do with the Epstein files. He had nothing to do with the horrific crimes that Mr. Epstein committed,” he said.He reiterated that DOJ is not withholding information intentionally: “We are not redacting information around President Trump, around any other individual involved with Mr. Epstein, and that narrative, which is not based on fact at all, is completely false.”",Deputy attorney general Todd Blanche said the move came at the request of victim advocacy groups.

Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner pitches $112bn plan to turn Gaza rubble into a tech hub,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-son-in-law-jared-kushner-pitches-112bn-plan-to-turn-gaza-rubble-into-a-tech-hub/articleshow/126109928.cms,"Hamas Refuses To End Gaza Fight? Netanyahu Gets Chilling Warning | ‘3rd INTIFADA Would Break Out’





Jared Kushner, former senior adviser to Donald Trump, is pitching a $112 billion proposal to rebuild the war-ravaged Gaza Strip into a futuristic technology and tourism hub, according to details first reported by The Wall Street Journal.Kushner, 44, alongside US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, has been presenting a 32-slide PowerPoint titled Project Sunrise: Building a New and Unified Gaza to regional governments, including Turkey, Egypt and wealthy Gulf states. The document outlines a vision of Gaza transformed into a gleaming coastal metropolis featuring high-speed rail, AI-driven energy grids and luxury beachside resorts.The plan estimates a total redevelopment cost of $112.1 billion over ten years. US support would cover roughly 20 per cent of direct funding, alongside additional loan guarantees and financial backstops that could bring Washington’s total exposure to nearly $60 billion.The plan frames Gaza as a future investment destination and tourism hotspot but provides few concrete details about governance or long-term political arrangements. It also does not clearly explain where Gaza’s roughly two million displaced Palestinians would live during reconstruction, noting only that they would be housed in “temporary shelter, field hospitals and mobile clinics”.The White House declined to comment directly on the proposal. However, spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said that the Trump administration remained committed to “laying the groundwork for a peaceful and prosperous Gaza”.Middle East analysts have cast serious doubt on whether the proposal is viable. Council on Foreign Relations senior fellow Steven Cook said the project cannot move forward without the disarmament of Hamas, which he described as unlikely.That condition is acknowledged within the presentation itself. The plan is explicitly tied to Hamas disarming, a requirement embedded in a broader, phased peace framework proposed by the Trump administration. Hamas has so far refused to lay down its weapons, effectively stalling further progress.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio echoed those concerns, warning that investors would not commit funds if Gaza risks returning to war within a few years.“You are not going to convince anyone to invest money in Gaza if they believe another war is going to happen,” Rubio said.Even if political hurdles were cleared, the physical challenges remain immense. Reconstruction would require clearing an estimated 68 million tonnes of debris, removing unexploded ordnance and landmines, and recovering the bodies of Palestinians killed during the conflict.Images from areas such as Khan Younis show vast stretches of flattened neighbourhoods, underscoring the scale of destruction that any redevelopment effort would have to overcome.Kushner and Witkoff have previously used private business networks in diplomatic efforts, including during negotiations related to the Israel-Hamas conflict and, more recently, exploratory talks linked to the Russia-Ukraine war. Whether their glossy vision for Gaza can move beyond PowerPoint slides and into reality, however, remains deeply uncertain.","Jared Kushner, former senior adviser to Donald Trump, is pitching a $112 billion proposal to rebuild the war-ravaged Gaza Strip.

Woman disappears after possible shark attack off California coast,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/woman-disappears-after-possible-shark-attack-off-california-coast/articleshow/126128996.cms,"



A 55-year-old California woman is missing after a frightening ocean incident off the state’s coast that authorities say may have involved a shark. The woman disappeared on Sunday, December 21, 2025, while swimming during daylight hours shortly after noon near Lovers Point in Pacific Grove, prompting an urgent multi-agency search and rescue operation that has so far failed to locate her.According to local officials, witnesses taking part in a group swim outing reported a large splash and signs of distress in the water around 12:04 p.m. local time, along with a possible shark sighting, shortly before the woman vanished. The group immediately returned to shore and realised the woman was missing about 100 yards offshore. Lifeguards and emergency responders were alerted just after noon and launched a search involving rescue boats, drones and aerial support. Despite several hours of coordinated efforts, no body or definitive physical evidence has been recovered.Authorities have been careful not to confirm a shark attack, describing the incident instead as a possible marine-animal encounter. Investigators said the lack of remains or clear bite marks makes it impossible to determine exactly what happened, and they have not ruled out other possibilities, including drowning or a medical emergency.Search operations involving Pacific Grove Police, local lifeguards and the U.S. Coast Guard continued until at least 8:00 p.m. on Sunday before being suspended due to darkness and ocean conditions. Officials said search efforts resumed on Monday, December 22, as crews reassessed conditions and followed up on witness accounts.Shark encounters along the California coast are rare, and fatal incidents are even more uncommon. Marine experts note that while great white sharks are known to inhabit coastal waters, confirmed attacks on humans occur infrequently and often involve cases of mistaken identity.The disappearance has drawn significant public attention, with officials urging caution against speculation as the investigation continues. Search efforts may be adjusted based on weather and ocean conditions, and authorities said they would provide updates if new information emerges.","The woman disappeared on Sunday, December 21, 2025, while swimming during daylight hours near Lovers Point in Pacific Grove.

MAGA rift: Heritage Foundation staff walk out after president defends Tucker Carlson interview with Nick Fuentes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/maga-rift-heritage-foundation-staff-walk-out-after-president-defends-tucker-carlson-interview-with-nick-fuentes/articleshow/126128706.cms,"



Defence of Tucker Carlson's interview sparks revolt

Walkouts, resignations and terminations

Board members also step down



Pence-linked group absorbs defectors

A wider MAGA identity crisis





More than a dozen employees have walked out of the Heritage Foundation, triggering one of the most serious internal crises in the organisation’s recent history. The departures follow mounting backlash against Heritage president Kevin Roberts after he defended a controversial interview by Tucker Carlson with far-right activist Nick Fuentes, a figure widely condemned for antisemitic views. The episode has laid bare deep fractures within the MAGA-aligned conservative movement over extremism, leadership and the movement’s future direction.The turmoil began after Roberts publicly justified Carlson’s decision to interview Fuentes, arguing that engagement rather than ostracism was the appropriate response. Critics inside and outside Heritage accused the leadership of normalising extremist voices and failing to draw clear moral boundaries.Roberts later issued multiple apologies, including in a video message on 6 November and in subsequent staff meetings, acknowledging that his response had caused harm. However, he did not formally sever institutional ties with Carlson. Instead, Roberts reiterated the foundation’s opposition to antisemitism while describing Carlson as a “close friend” in a personal capacity, a distinction that failed to calm internal dissent.In a Sunday night email to staff, Roberts acknowledged that “most of our legal and economic centres” were departing immediately, adding that while the organisation wished them well, “the manner of their departures speaks volumes”. While many staff members resigned voluntarily, Heritage leadership has said that some employees were terminated for “conduct inconsistent with the organisation’s mission and standards”.The exits included senior figures from Heritage’s legal scholarship, economic policy and data analysis teams, representing a significant loss of institutional expertise for a think tank that has long shaped conservative policy and judicial thinking.The staff exodus has been accompanied by resignations at board level. Three trustees have stepped down in protest, citing what they described as an inadequate response to antisemitism concerns and growing reputational damage to the organisation.Departing figures have warned that Heritage’s standing within conservative legal and academic circles has been weakened, with judges and senior officials reportedly distancing themselves from Heritage events and programmes.Many of the departing staff have moved to Advancing American Freedom, a rival organisation founded by former vice president Mike Pence. The group has confirmed it raised $13 million to fund its expansion and announced the hiring of at least 13 former Heritage employees, including senior policy figures.Advancing American Freedom has positioned itself around traditional conservative principles such as free markets, limited government and the rule of law, staking out territory that Heritage once dominated before the rise of Trump-era populism.Heritage leadership has pushed back strongly against critics. Senior officials have framed the departures as an issue of loyalty, stressing that alignment with the organisation’s mission and adherence to leadership are non-negotiable.In public statements and internal communications, Roberts has argued that Heritage remains open to debate but cannot function without unity, a stance that has further fuelled criticism from former staff who say dissent is no longer tolerated.The rupture at Heritage reflects a broader struggle within US conservatism over how closely institutions should align with the MAGA movement and how they should respond to extremist figures gaining mainstream visibility. Historically, think tanks like Heritage acted as gatekeepers, keeping fringe actors at arm’s length to protect electoral credibility.As conservatives continue to debate the legacy of Donald Trump and the future direction of the movement, the walkout at Heritage stands as one of the clearest signs yet of a MAGA rift playing out inside one of the right’s most influential institutions.",More than a dozen employees have walked out of the Heritage Foundation.

Epstein files out: Bill Clinton spokesman says DOJ protecting someone in document rollout,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/epstein-files-out-bill-clinton-spokesman-says-doj-protecting-someone-in-document-rollout/articleshow/126128613.cms,"



Spokesperson for Bill Clinton called on the Department of Justice to release any documents related to the former President in its ongoing disclosure of files concerning convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein Angel Ureña issued the rare statement as the Trump administration sought to make Clinton the GOP’s new boogeyman in the protracted saga over the files, which has embroiled the White House, Politico reported.“What the Department of Justice has released so far, and the manner in which it did so, makes one thing clear: someone or something is being protected,” Ureña said in the statement. “We do not know whom, what or why. But we do know this: We need no such protection.”The DOJ released its first batch of documents on Friday but stopped short of publishing all of the federal govt’s documents related to various investigations into the disgraced financier, as mandated by the Epstein Files Transparency Act, signed into law by President Donald Trump last month.Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said last week that the DOJ was reviewing material to protect victims’ identities and would be releasing potentially hundreds of thousands of additional files in the coming weeks.He also said that “there’s no effort to hold anything back because there’s the name Donald J. Trump or anybody else’s name.”On Friday the DOJ disclosed thousands of photos and other records, including multiple images of Clinton with Epstein’s convicted co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell and individuals with redacted faces. The law allowed redaction of material related to active investigations and any records that “contain personally identifiable information of victims.”Ureña warned that if the DOJ declined to comply with Clinton’s request, it would confirm the administration’s intention of “using selective releases to imply wrongdoing about individuals who have already been repeatedly cleared by the very same Department of Justice, over many years, under Presidents and Attorneys General of both parties.”The White House deferred to the DOJ, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Ureña’s statement.Clinton has been linked to Epstein since the early 1990s, with the two having been photographed together on several occasions. The former President has said he was not aware of Epstein’s crimes and has never been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein. As previously reported, Clinton flew on Epstein’s plane in the 1990s to several international locales, accompanied by his Secret Service detail.Blanche, the second-highest ranking official at the DOJ, maintained that the Trump administration was complying with the law despite heavily redacting and omitting substantial materials from its initial release. Bipartisan lawmakers have accused the administration of flouting the law, although the act does not specify a legal penalty for failing to release all mandated files within the 30-day timeline.Blanche also defended the DOJ’s decision to temporarily remove several documents published in the initial release, including one featuring a photo of Trump, telling NBC’s Kristen Welker during an interview on “Meet the Press” that the photo was taken down in response to concerns raised by victims and that it would be reinstated following a review.",Angel Ureña issued the rare statement as the Trump administration sought to make Clinton the GOP’s new boogeyman in the saga over the files.

Real-life 'Stranger Things': Girl who went to explore Hawkins Lab site dies after falling from building,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/real-life-stranger-things-girl-who-went-to-explore-hawkins-lab-site-dies-after-falling-from-building/articleshow/126128579.cms,"



A late-night visit to an abandoned building made famous by the Netflix series Stranger Things ended in tragedy when a 19-year-old girl fell to her death while exploring the restricted site. The building was used as the filming location for Hawkins National Laboratory in the series. The incident occurred on December 19 at the Briarcliff Building on the Briarcliff campus of Emory University in DeKalb County, Georgia.Police identified the victim as Leah Palmirotto. Emergency responders from DeKalb County Police and Fire Rescue were called to the scene and pronounced her dead shortly after arrival. Authorities said she had entered the fenced-off property with friends despite the building being closed to the public and clearly marked with no-trespassing signs.Investigators have said there is no indication of foul play, but the exact cause of the fall remains under investigation. It is not yet clear whether Palmirotto slipped from the roof, lost her footing in the dark or fell through a structurally weakened section of the building, which has been vacant and deteriorating for decades. Emory University police have taken over the investigation.The five-storey structure, often referred to as the Briarcliff Building or Building A, was originally constructed in the 1960s as part of the Georgia Mental Health Institute, a former psychiatric hospital.Although the property was later acquired by Emory University, the building has remained unused and is widely regarded as unsafe due to structural decay, poor lighting and restricted access.In recent years, the site has drawn attention because it was used as Hawkins National Laboratory in the hit Netflix series Stranger Things. The building’s eerie appearance made it a natural filming location for the fictional government facility central to the show’s plot, but its pop culture fame has also made it a target for urban explorers and trespassers.Friends told police that Palmirotto and others were exploring the site out of curiosity, a practice safety officials repeatedly warn against. Abandoned buildings pose serious risks, including unstable surfaces, hidden drops and weakened structures, particularly at night.Palmirotto’s father has spoken publicly about his daughter’s death, describing her as adventurous, outgoing and full of life. While expressing his grief, he urged others to stay away from abandoned and restricted buildings, warning that the dangers are often not obvious until it is too late. Friends and family have remembered her as a kind and vibrant young woman, and a vigil is being planned in her honour.The incident has renewed discussion about the real-world dangers associated with abandoned filming locations linked to popular television shows. While Stranger Things has used multiple sites across Georgia, there has been no public comment from Netflix regarding the death. Police say the investigation into the circumstances of the fall is ongoing.","Leah Palmirotto, 19, fell to her death at the Briarcliff Building in Georgia.

The conservative movement’s leading figures clashed repeatedly on stage at Turning Point USA’s annual AmericaFest, revealing deep divisions among the right-wing media and MAGA base itself. The four-day convention wsa led by Erika Kirk after the assassination of her husband and Conservative speaker Charlie Kirk.“Say what you want about AmFest, but it’s definitely not boring,” said Kirk. “Feels like a Thanksgiving dinner where your family’s hashing out the family business.”The event took no time to become a slander fest. Right-wing speaker Ben Shapiro set the tone with the first speech after Kirk’s opening remarks, criticising fellow commentators. Candace Owens, he said, “has been vomiting all sorts of hideous and conspiratorial nonsense into the public square for years.” He also attacked Megyn Kelly for refusing to condemn Owens regarding theories about Charlie Kirk’s death, calling her “guilty of cowardice. ” Tucker Carlson, who hosted Nick Fuentes on his podcast, was criticised as committing “an act of moral imbecility.”Carlson fired back within the hour, mocking Shapiro’s efforts to “deplatform and denounce” those with differing views.“I watched it,” he said. “I laughed.”The media feud continued. Steve Bannon, former Trump loyalist, said, “Ben Shapiro is like a cancer, and that cancer spreads.” Kelly dismissed Shapiro as a marginal figure, saying their friendship is over. “I resent that he thinks he’s in a position to decide who must say what, to whom, and when,” she said. Owens was not welcome at the convention but still called Shapiro a “miserable imp” on her podcast.Debates over Israel also emerged. Carlson criticised civilian deaths in Gaza, while Bannon accused Shapiro and other supporters of Israel of being part of “the Israel first crowd.” Kelly said criticism from Shapiro and Bari Weiss, now head of CBS News, “is about Israel.”Amid the chaos, Turning Point reaffirmed its political priorities. Erika Kirk pledged support for vice president JD Vance to become the president in 2028. “We are going to get my husband’s friend JD Vance elected for 48 in the most resounding way possible,” she said.The convention also mentioned the rising Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement, led by Health secretary Robert F.

Trump’s Greenland obsession gets official: President taps MAGA ally as Greenland envoy; Denmark warns on sovereignty,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-greenland-obsession-gets-official-president-taps-maga-ally-as-greenland-envoy-denmark-warns-on-sovereignty/articleshow/126127673.cms,"



If geopolitics had a sense of humour, this would be the punchline.President Donald Trump has nominated a MAGA ally as the United States’ first-ever special envoy to Greenland — a job that didn’t exist until Trump’s long-running fascination with the ice-covered island refused to melt away. The move, announced Sunday, immediately set off alarm bells in Denmark, which quickly reminded Washington that Greenland is not, in fact, on the clearance rack for American expansion.Trump said in a statement, “Jeff understands how essential Greenland is to our National Security, and will strongly advance our Country’s Interests for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Allies, and indeed, the World.”Landry, who took office in January 2024 and whose term ends in January 2028, described it as a “volunteer position.” “It’s an honor to serve you in this volunteer position to make Greenland a part of the U.S.,” he wrote on X. He added, “This in no way affects my position as Governor of Louisiana!”On Monday, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said in a brief statement emailed to ABC News that “the appointment confirms the continued American interest in Greenland.” “However, we insist that everyone—including the U.S.—must show respect for the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark,” he added. In separate remarks to TV2, he called the nomination “completely unacceptable” and said he would demand an “explanation” from the US ambassador. “As long as we have a kingdom in Denmark that consists of Denmark, the Faroe Islands, and Greenland, we cannot accept that there are those who undermine our sovereignty,” he said.Greenland’s Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said Landry’s appointment “doesn’t change anything for us here at home.” He wrote on social media, “We will determine our future ourselves. Greenland is our country,” adding, “Greenland belongs to Greenlanders, and territorial integrity must be respected.”Earlier this month, the Danish Defence Intelligence Service reported that the United States was leveraging its economic clout to “assert its will” and was willing to threaten military force against both allies and adversaries. The report highlighted the growing “strategic importance of the Arctic” amid the intensifying conflict “between Russia and the West.”Trump had long harboured ambitions to assume jurisdiction over Greenland. During his presidential transition and the opening months of his second term, he repeatedly pushed for the United States to assume control of the island and declined to rule out using military force. “For purposes of National Security and Freedom throughout the World, the United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity,” he wrote on Truth Social exactly a year ago.On March 28-2025, Vice President JD Vance travelled to Pituffik Space Base in Greenland, where he accused Denmark of failing to invest adequately in the territory. The dispute later resurfaced in August when Danish officials summoned the US ambassador after reports that at least three individuals with ties to Trump had conducted covert influence operations in Greenland. Trump had appointed Ken Howery, a co-founder of PayPal, as US ambassador to Denmark last year.","President Donald Trump has nominated a MAGA ally as the United States’ first- ever special envoy to Greenland.

US vice president JD Vance was criticised after linking American identity to Christianity while advocating restrictions on the H-1B visa program.The MAGA leader was speaking at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest, where he discussed “true Christian politics.""Vance claimed that restricting high-skilled immigration was both a moral and economic move. Vance said: “Why have we worked, without the help of Congress, to restrict H-1B visas?” He then answered his own question: “Because we believe it is wrong for companies to bypass American labour just to go for cheaper options in the third world.”He reiterated: “The only thing that is truly served as an anchor of the United States of America is that we have been, and by the grace of God, we always will be, a Christian nation.”The speech was grilled by right-wing analyst Richard Hanania, who called Vance’s comments ""incoherent"" on social media.He listed Vance's priorities: 1) fighting outsourcing, 2) restricting H-1Bs, 3) shielding Social Security from taxes, 4) protecting Medicaid from SomalisRichard claimed that all these priorities lacked a unifying principle. Hanania said: “Christianity is just nativist economic illiteracy, giveaways to old people, and whatever right-wing Twitter cares about today.”Vance’s comments come amid ongoing debate over the future of the H-1B program. Hardliners like Republican Steve Bannon and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis have called for its complete elimination, and Vance suggested a reform rather than abolition of the visa program.He pointed to recent Trump administration measures, including higher fees and enhanced vetting for H-1B applicants, particularly affecting Indian workers, as steps to prevent abuse and ensure fairness.The debate is relevant given that over 730,000 H-1B visa holders work in technology and engineering roles in the United States, while younger Americans face student debt and layoffs in the tech sector.Ex-DOGE lead Vivek Ramaswamy also spoke in the same event and pointed out how attracting global talent is necessary to US.","JD Vance was speaking at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest.
