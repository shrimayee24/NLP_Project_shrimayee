The woman had said she did not wish to return to her father due to physical harassment by her brothers, who have been pressuring her to return to her abusive husband, from whom she has separated.""If a fully mature adult, capable of making her own decisions, has clearly expressed her desire to live independently, the court cannot override her will. It cannot, and should not, compel an adult to return to the custody of another, even if that person is a well-meaning parent,"" Justice Kaul said.In her statement before the magistrate - recorded on the HC's directives - the woman said she was residing separately of her own free will. The lower court confirmed this, saying there was no external influence on her decision.Justice Kaul observed that the argument about a father being a better custodian of an adult woman than herself was not only antiquated but also ran contrary to the constitutional guarantee of personal liberty.""The identity and autonomy of an adult woman are not defined by her relationships or familial obligations.

VIJAYAWADA: In a chilling case reminiscent of Kerala's notorious Koodathayi murders, three women from Tenali in Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh have been arrested for a series of killings using cyanide, targeting vulnerable people over the past two years. Police have so far identified three victims but suspect there could be more.The accused, identified as Munagappa Rajani (40), Mudiyala Venkateswari alias Bujji (32), and Gontu Ramanamma (60), all residents of Tenali, have so far admitted to killing three with cyanide-laced drinks and food to rob them of gold and money .Police said they would get to know if there were other victims once their interrogation is over.The group systematically targeted individuals, including family members and neighbours, and are believed to be involved in multiple murders since 2022 besides failed attempts to kill three others.Police said the accused purchased cyanide from a man named Krishna, who works at a gold shop in Tenali, for Rs 4,000 on two occasions. Krishna is on the run.According to Guntur SP S Satish Kumar, investigation began after the decomposed body of one Shaik Nagoor Bee was found in a field near Vadlamudi village about two months ago. Police initially registered a case of suspicious death due to causes unknown.After analysing mobile data and questioning multiple witnesses, including an auto driver identified as Mahesh, police pieced together the chilling conspiracy .Investigation revealed that the accused lured the victim to the outskirts of Vadlamudi on June 5, under the pretence of a friendly outing. They spiked her drink with cyanide-laced alcohol, causing her death, and then stole her gold ornaments.The auto driver confirmed that he had picked up the accused women and the victim. He said he also saw them purchasing alcohol that turned fatal for Nagoor Bee.Guntur special branch inspector A Srinivas told TOI that the accused systematically targeted vulnerable women to steal their valuables. Their modus operandi involved mixing cyanide into drinks and food, a strategy reminiscent of Kerala's Jolly Joseph, who was convicted of killing six family members with cyanide over 14 years.Among their other victims were accused Venkateswari's mother-in-law, Subbalakshmi, who they killed to inherit property and gold, and Nagamma, the accused's 65-year-old neighbour, who was killed in Aug last year to evade a loan repayment of Rs 20,000.In another incident, they killed a man in collaboration with his wife, Bhudevi, in April this year to claim his insurance and pension.Apart from the murders, the group also attempted to kill three other women. Annapurna, who worked as a village volunteer, was given cyanide-mixed food, but she grew suspicious and did not consume it.One Muragappa Varalamadi was also given food mixed with cyanide, but she got a call from her husband at the same time. When she informed him that she was present with the accused women, they dropped their plan of killing her for fear of getting caught.","Three women from Tenali in Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh have been arrested for a series of killings using cyanide.

The shooting left four people dead and nine others wounded, raising serious questions about how the teenager obtained the weapon used in the massacre.According to investigators, Colt Gray used an AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle to carry out the attack, killing two teachers and two students.Sources say the rifle was purchased by Colin Gray as a Christmas present for his son, just months after the family had been questioned about online threats related to a potential school shooting .The Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) confirmed Colin Gray’s arrest on Thursday. ""In coordination with District Attorney Brad Smith, the GBI has arrested Colin Gray, age 54, in connection to the shooting at Apalachee High School. Colin is Colt Gray's father,"" the GBI posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.Last year, both father and son were questioned by local authorities after threats appeared on a Discord account tied to potential violence at a school. However, no concrete evidence linked them to the threats. The father had claimed that while he kept hunting guns in the house, his son did not have unsupervised access. ""This case was worked, and at the time the boy was 13, and it wasn't enough to substantiate,"" explained Jackson County Sheriff Janis Mangum. ""If we get a judge's order or we charge somebody, we take firearms for safekeeping.""Despite these assurances, investigators now believe that the rifle used in Wednesday's shooting was purchased after the initial probe. “He knows the seriousness of weapons and what they can do, and how to use them and not use them,” the father, Colin Gray, said according to a transcript obtained from the sheriff's office.The timeline, provided by Colin Gray, places the gun purchase months after authorities investigated the family. The ease with which Colt Gray was able to access the weapon remains a key point of focus in the ongoing investigation.“This case was worked thoroughly last year, but at the time, the evidence wasn’t strong enough to confiscate their weapons,” Mangum added. “If we had solid proof, we would have taken the guns for safekeeping.”Jackson County investigators had closed the 2023 case after they were unable to link the Grays to the online threats or justify seizing their firearms. Now, with devastating consequences, the case has resurfaced with new urgency.Colt Gray was arrested shortly after the shooting and is being held without bond at the Gainesville Regional Youth Detention Center.

'Flying Chernobyl': Can Russia's new nuclear-powered missile be a game-changer?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/burevestnik-ssc-x-9-skyfall-russias-new-nuclear-cruise-missile-vladimir-putin/articleshow/113058073.cms,"Driving the news

Recent satellite imagery suggests Russia is constructing launch facilities near a nuclear warhead storage site in Vologda, about 295 miles north of Moscow, where experts believe the missile could be deployed.

This development, first reported by Reuters, has raised concerns about Moscow’s ambitions to operationalize the missile despite a history of failed tests and safety issues.

The Burevestnik was first revealed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2018, who touted it as part of a new generation of “invincible” weapons that could evade US missile defenses and strike anywhere in the world.

in 2018, who touted it as part of a new generation of “invincible” weapons that could evade US missile defenses and strike anywhere in the world. Its unique propulsion system—powered by a miniature nuclear reactor—grants it an almost unlimited range, allowing it to fly low and avoid detection. But its lengthy and troubled testing record, along with the technical and safety challenges it presents, has left many experts skeptical of its actual military value.

Jeffery Lewis, a missile expert at the Middlebury Institute, reviewed the satellite images and concurred. ""This imagery suggests something very unique, very different. It aligns with Russia’s development of this nuclear-powered missile,"" he remarked, highlighting the unusual characteristics of the site and its close proximity to nuclear storage bunkers.

A satellite image shows what is believed to be a deployment site for a Russian nuclear-powered cruise missile.

Why it matters

The Burevestnik represents a bold leap in missile technology, but its potential deployment could intensify an already volatile global security environment.

The missile's ability to bypass current missile defense systems gives it a unique capability that worries Western analysts, though many argue that the practical benefits of such a weapon remain questionable.

If deployed, the Burevestnik could further escalate the nuclear arms race, especially as US-Russia arms control agreements like New START inch toward expiration.

At the same time, the missile’s unproven reliability and significant safety risks—particularly the possibility of radiation leaks from its nuclear reactor—pose a threat not only to potential adversaries but also to Russia itself.

The missile’s subsonic speed, one of its key design flaws, makes it vulnerable to interception, undermining its intended stealth advantages. Furthermore, the risk of catastrophic failure during testing or deployment could result in severe environmental consequences.

Zoom in

The Burevestnik is designed around a concept that has been explored since the early days of the nuclear age: a nuclear-powered propulsion system that would allow a missile to fly indefinitely. Unlike conventional missiles that rely on limited fuel reserves, the Burevestnik’s miniature nuclear reactor provides the energy needed to keep it in flight for days, potentially even allowing it to circumnavigate the globe.

The missile is launched using solid-fuel boosters, which propel it into the air, where its nuclear reactor activates to sustain its flight. In theory, the missile can fly at low altitudes to evade radar detection while maintaining a range of around 15,000 miles (23,000 kilometers). This would enable it to reach targets anywhere in the world, far surpassing the range of existing intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).

However, the missile’s subsonic speed—a byproduct of its nuclear propulsion—has raised concerns about its detectability. While it can fly longer than traditional missiles, it moves slower, giving enemy defense systems more time to track and potentially intercept it. This drawback limits the missile’s operational value compared to other Russian missile systems, such as the Sarmat ICBM, which is faster and capable of delivering multiple warheads over similar distances.

Between 2017 and 2019, Russia conducted at least 13 known tests of the Burevestnik, with most ending in failure. Only two tests were reported as partial successes. In one test in 2019, the missile crashed into the White Sea, causing a catastrophic explosion that killed several Russian scientists. This incident highlighted the dangers of the missile’s nuclear-powered engine, leading experts to question whether the risks outweigh the benefits.

The big picture

The potential deployment of the Burevestnik is being closely monitored by the US and Nato, especially after satellite imagery revealed construction activities near the Vologda-20 nuclear warhead storage facility. The site, located roughly 400 miles from Russia’s borders with Finland and Estonia, appears to be designed for large, fixed missile systems, according to analysts. This development suggests that Russia may be preparing to station Burevestnik missiles at the site, making them ready to launch on short notice.

Experts remain divided on whether the Burevestnik would significantly alter Russia’s strategic capabilities. Some argue that the missile’s ability to evade missile defenses and fly long distances gives it a unique advantage, particularly in a second-strike scenario. Others, however, are skeptical.

One of the most significant concerns surrounding the Burevestnik is its nuclear propulsion system. Because the missile is powered by an unshielded nuclear reactor, it could spew radioactive material along its flight path or in the event of a malfunction.

When compared to other missile systems in Russia’s arsenal, the Burevestnik’s advantages appear limited. For instance, the Sarmat ICBM, which also carries nuclear warheads, has a range of over 11,000 miles (17,700 kilometers) and can deliver multiple warheads at hypersonic speeds. This makes it far more difficult to intercept than the slower Burevestnik, which could be tracked and shot down during its prolonged flight.

Moreover, the Burevestnik’s unique propulsion system raises significant safety and reliability concerns. The 2019 explosion during a test recovery operation underscored the dangers of handling a nuclear-powered missile.

What they are saying

“The Skyfall is a uniquely stupid weapon system, a flying Chernobyl that poses more threat to Russia than to other countries,” said Thomas Countryman, a former US State Department official.

is a uniquely stupid weapon system, a flying Chernobyl that poses more threat to Russia than to other countries,” said Thomas Countryman, a former US State Department official. Hans Kristensen, from the Federation of American Scientists, told Reutets that the missile will be ""as vulnerable as any cruise missile,"" while analyst Jeffery Lewis emphasizes, ""The site’s design suggests they’re preparing for something very unique.""

“I don’t understand Putin’s motive here,” Kristensen added, referring to the missile’s uncertain strategic value.

As per Reuters, Decker Eveleth, the analyst who identified the construction site, believes it’s clearly designed for the Burevestnik. ""The site is for a large, fixed missile system, and the only large system they're currently developing is Skyfall,"" he said, pointing to the nine horizontal launch pads shielded by berms to protect against explosions or attacks.

What’s next

As Russia moves closer to deploying the Burevestnik, the missile’s impact on global security remains uncertain. While it could symbolize Russia’s determination to maintain its status as a nuclear superpower, its actual operational value may be limited by its technical flaws and safety issues.

The missile’s troubled test history suggests that it may not live up to the lofty claims made by Putin when he first announced it in 2018.

Nonetheless, the Burevestnik’s development could have broader implications for the global arms race. With the US and Russia’s New START treaty set to expire in 2026, the missile could become a bargaining chip in future arms control negotiations. Pavel Podvig, a Russian nuclear expert, described the missile as a “political weapon” that Putin has used to project strength and signal Russia’s willingness to challenge the West.

As tensions between Russia and the West continue to rise—particularly in the context of the war in Ukraine—the Burevestnik’s deployment could add another layer of complexity to an already dangerous geopolitical landscape.

However, ""the Burevestnik is not a wonder weapon, and the challenges it poses for NATO security are neither new nor unmanageable. It may seem scary on paper, but the technical infeasibility of its mission limits its threat. Much of the hype around the missile stems from Russian saber-rattling about its capabilities,"" Eveleth, an analyst with the CNA research, wrote in a report in Foreign Policy.

TikTok Chroming Challenge: TikTok's deadly 'chroming' challenge trend: Growing crisis among Gen Z and Gen Alpha,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tiktoks-deadly-chroming-challenge-trend-growing-crisis-among-gen-z-and-gen-alpha/articleshow/113111868.cms,"Tragic cases: Esra Haynes and Sarah Mescall

TikTok's response and ongoing danger

Recent cases highlight risks

Ongoing efforts and future concerns

A disturbing new trend called ""chroming"" has emerged on TikTok , leading to several tragic deaths among teenagers. This fad involves inhaling toxic fumes from products like aerosol cans and spray deodorants to achieve a temporary high. The trend, which gained traction under the hashtag ‘WhipTok,’ has proven fatal for some, sparking widespread concern and warnings from affected families.One notable victim is Esra Haynes, a 13-year-old from Melbourne, Australia, who died on March 31, 2023.After participating in the chroming trend at a sleepover, Haynes suffered severe brain damage and a cardiac arrest, eventually succumbing to her injuries after a week in the hospital, reported Dexerto.com. Her parents, Paul and Andrea Haynes, have since been vocal about the dangers of chroming. Paul Haynes expressed his grief on Australian TV, saying, “Esra would’ve never have done this if she’d known the consequences. That it could take your life.” Andrea Haynes added, “The ripple effect is that this is absolutely devastating, we’ve got no child to bring home.”Similarly, 14-year-old Sarah Mescall from Ireland died in September 2023 after allegedly engaging in the chroming challenge . Mescall collapsed and was later placed in a medically-induced coma before passing away. Irish authorities are investigating the link between her death and the viral trend.In response to these incidents, TikTok has reportedly said that content related to dangerous challenges is prohibited and will be removed if found. The platform emphasized its commitment to safety, saying, “We will continue to prioritize protecting and supporting our community, working with expert partners and providing safety resources to those who need them.”Despite these efforts, the trend has continued to claim lives. In March 2024, an 11-year-old boy, Tommy-Lee, died after attempting the chroming challenge at a sleepover. His grandmother has called for TikTok to be banned and stricter age restrictions on social media, stating, “We want to get TikTok taken down, and no children to be allowed on any social media under 16 years of age.”Recent reports also include a 12-year-old girl from the UK, Tiegan, who was hospitalized after attempting the chroming challenge, and a 12-year-old boy, Cesar, who went into cardiac arrest after inhaling deodorant. Both cases underscore the severe risks associated with the trend. Cesar’s mother, Nichola King, recounted the terrifying moment she found her son seizing on the floor, and urged other parents to be vigilant.The chroming trend is not the only dangerous fad on TikTok, but its lethal consequences highlight the urgent need for parental awareness and preventive measures.

Gangster serving life term for murder ‘initiated into Juna Akhara as a monk’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gangster-serving-life-term-for-murder-initiated-into-juna-akhara-as-a-monk/articleshow/113136711.cms,"Don initiated as sadhu in Uttarakhand prison while serving life sentence

ALMORA: Underworld don Prakash Pandey , also known as 'PP' in the corridors of crime, while serving a life sentence and facing several pending court cases for extortion, robbery and murder, was initiated into ' monkhood ' in Uttarakhand's Almora jail and will now be known as 'Prakasha Nand Giri'. Jail officials, however, denied any involvement in the matter.The initiation, which took about 25 minutes, was conducted by at least three senior seers purportedly from the Juna Akhara sect inside the prison complex on Thursday, raising questions about how a notorious criminal was allowed to undergo such a ceremony. In jail, Pandey was declared a ""successor"" and was provided a Kanthi mala, Rudraksha mala and saffron clothes.Distancing themselves from the ceremony, Almora jail superintendent Jayant Pangti said on Friday, ""A few religious people visited the prison and sought permission to meet Prakash Pandey. Three of them were allowed to go inside. It seems they spent some time with him and whatever they discussed about religion inside is their personal matter. There was no involvement of prison administration and we're not concerned with their claims.""DIG (prisons), Dadhiram Maurya, said he came to know about the incident from social media. He added: ""Jail superintendent didn't send us a report of any such incident. But, we've initiated an internal probe to ascertain what actually happened, following which further measures would be taken.""After the prison 'ritual', Rajendra Giri , who claimed to be from Juna Akhara and was present at the event, said, ""Prakasha Nand Giri had expressed his desire to renounce his criminal past and turn towards religion. He showed his willingness to embrace the spiritual path and we respected his wish.""Giri added: ""In next year's Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj, he will undergo further rituals, including a formal ceremony to be named 'mandaleshwar', a prestigious title in the akhara tradition. If he continues on this spiritual path, it might inspire others with a troubled past as well."" The seers also held a press conference in which they claimed to have ""come from Haridwar Juna Akhara"".However, Har Giri, a senior functionary at Juna Akhara in Haridwar, said, ""A committee, comprising retired and current office-bearers of Juna Akhara, has been set up to investigate the matter. It will also discuss who made whom a head of a 'mutth'... If any person wishes to adopt 'sannyas' (renunciation) or follow Sanatan Dharma , we cannot stop him. We're not violating any law or court rules.""Incidentally, despite his criminal background, Pandey -- now in his 50s -- has been declared as a successor to some 'mutths', including Kamad in Munsyari and Lamkeshwar in Gangolihat.Pandey alias Bunty -- a feared name in the underworld during the 1990s -- was one of Uttarakhand's most wanted criminals. Over the years, he was involved in numerous crimes, including extorting Bollywood celebrities and politicians. Held in Vietnam in 2010, Pandey had been in and out of various prisons across the state.In Almora jail, he became increasingly involved in religious activities. Earlier this year, as per reports, Acharya Dandinath, a religious leader from Nepal, also initiated him into the 'Nath' sect, naming him 'Yogi Prakash Nath'.","Prakash Pandey, known as 'PP' in the corridors of crime, was initiated into'monkhood' in Uttarakhand's Almora jail.

They have started a special ritual at the Shiva temple near Raji Chauraha. A relay havan has started at the temple where chanting of hymns and mantras is underway as villagers gather in large numbers to seek protection from Lord Shiva.Since July 17, over 50 villages in Mahsi tehsil have been living in fear of wolf attacks. Despite efforts by the authorities like deploying 25 forest department teams, 32 revenue teams, 200 PAC personnel and police from local and reserve units, the situation remains grim. Special teams from Lucknow, led by chief forest conservator Renu Singh, have also joined the efforts. However, the wolf attacks and fatalities continue to rise, leaving the villagers disheartened with the administration's response and are turning to prayer for safety.On Thursday evening, a special prayer ceremony was held at the Shiva temple, located in the residence of former village head Ganga Ram Verma at Raji Chauraha.

The shooting, which resulted in four deaths and nine injuries, has ignited fierce debate over gun control and school safety.During a rally in Arizona on Thursday, Vance described school shootings as a grim ""fact of life"" and criticized Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris for her gun control stance.""Now look, the Kamala Harris answer to this is to take law-abiding citizens’ guns away from them,"" Vance remarked. He further stated, “I don’t like this. I don’t like to admit this. I don’t like that this is a fact of life.”Vance suggested that increasing security at schools is the only viable solution, albeit reluctantly. “We’ve got to bolster security so that if a psycho wants to walk through the front door and kill a bunch of children, they’re not able to,” he said. His fatalistic view has drawn criticism for being dismissive of the root causes of gun violence and overly simplistic.The Harris campaign seized on Vance’s comments, with Harris herself posting a rebuttal on X (formerly Twitter). “School shootings are not just a fact of life,” she wrote. “It doesn’t have to be this way. We can take action to protect our children – and we will.”Vance’s remarks were also scrutinized for their inconsistency. He admitted that he doesn’t support increased security around schools for his own children, yet he proposed it as a nationwide solution. “As a parent, do I want my school to have additional security? No, of course I don’t,” Vance conceded.The controversy has also drawn reactions from other political figures. Tim Walz, Governor of Minnesota and Harris’s running mate, described Vance’s comments as “pathetic” and emphasized the need for better protection for children.In contrast, Trump addressed the shooting at a Fox News town hall, emphasizing a need for societal healing without directly engaging with policy specifics. “It’s a sick and angry world for a lot of reasons and we’re going to make it better,” Trump said.","JD Vance, running mate to Donald Trump, is facing significant backlash after his response to Wednesday's mass shooting at Apalachee High School in Georgia.

A 20-year-old Pakistani national , named Muhammad Shahzeb Khan , living in Canada was taken into custody after being charged with attempting to orchestrate an attack in New York City and providing material support and resources to the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham ( ISIS ), according to a statement released by the US Department of Justice on Friday.As per the statement, Attorney general Merrick B Garland said that Khan who also goes by the name Shahzeb Jadoon allegedly planned a terrorist attack in New York City around October 7 ""with the intent of slaughtering in the name of ISIS, as many Jewish people as possible.""Khan attempted to travel from Canada to New York City and intended to carry out a mass shooting at a Jewish center in Brooklyn, New York.He was arrested in Canada, just 12 miles (19 km) from the US border.""We are deeply grateful to our Canadian partners for their critical law enforcement actions in this matter. Jewish communities like all communities in this country should not have to fear that they will be targeted by a hate-fueled terrorist attack,"" Garland said in the statement.Around November 2023, Khan began expressing his support for ISIS on social media platforms and through encrypted messaging applications. During this time, he shared ISIS propaganda videos and literature with others. Later, Khan started engaging in communication with two undercover law enforcement officers, according to the statement.Khan told two undercover law enforcement officers to obtain AR-style assault rifles, ammunition, and other materials to carry out the attacks, and identified locations where the attacks would take place and shared information about his plans to cross the border from Canada into the United States to execute the attacks.The planned attack was set for around Oct. 7, 2024, nearly a year after Hamas launched an assault in Israel, resulting in over 1,000 deaths. Khan said that ""Oct 7th and Oct 11th are the best days for targeting the Jews"" citing October 7 as the anniversary of the Hamas attack on Israel and October 11 as Yom Kippur , a Jewish religious holiday.The Pakistani national faces a single count of attempting to provide material support and resources to a designated foreign terrorist organisation. If found guilty, he could receive a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. The final sentence will be determined by a federal district court judge, who will consider the US Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.FBI Director Christopher Wray said, ""The defendant was allegedly determined to kill Jewish people here in the United States, nearly one year after Hamas' horrific attack on Israel. This investigation was led by the FBI, and I am proud of the terrific work by the FBI team and our partners to disrupt Khan's plan.""“The FBI will continue to work closely with our partners to investigate and hold accountable those who seek to commit violence in the name of ISIS or other terrorist organizations.

Kennedy Jr.'s name must be taken off state ballots for president , upending plans in the battleground state just as officials were about to begin mailing out the nation's first absentee ballots for the Nov. 5 presidential .The intermediate-level Court of Appeals issued an order granting Kennedy's request to halt the mailing of ballots that included his name.The court also told a trial judge to order the State Board of Elections to distribute ballots without Kennedy's name on them. No legal explanation was given.State law otherwise required the first absentee ballots to be mailed or transmitted no later than 60 days before the general election, making Friday the deadline. The process of reprinting and assembling ballot packages likely would take more than two weeks, state attorneys have said. The ruling could be appealed.Kennedy, the nominee of the We The People party in North Carolina, had sued last week to get off the state's ballots after he suspended his campaign and endorsed Republican nominee Donald Trump. But the Democratic majority on the State Board of Elections rejected the request, saying it was too late in the process of printing ballots and coding tabulation machines. Kennedy then sued.Wake County Superior Court Judge Rebecca Holt on Thursday denied Kennedy's effort to keep his name off ballots, prompting his appeal. In the meantime, Holt told election officials to hold back sending absentee ballots until noon Friday.A favorable outcome for Kennedy could assist Trump's efforts to win the presidential battleground of North Carolina. Trump won the state's electoral votes by just 1.3 percentage points over Democrat Joe Biden in 2020.More than 132,500 people - military and overseas workers and in-state civilian residents - have requested North Carolina absentee ballots so far, the State Board of Elections said.In an email, state board attorney Paul Cox told election directors in all 100 counties after Friday's ruling to hold on to the current ballots but not send them. More than 2.9 million absentee and in-person ballots have been printed so far.No decision has been made on appealing Friday's decision, Cox wrote, and removing Kennedy and running mate Nicole Shanahan from the ballot would be ""a major undertaking for everyone,"" Cox wrote.Since Kennedy suspended his campaign, the environmentalist and author has tried to get his name removed from ballots in several states where the race between Trump and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris are expected to be close.Kennedy on Wednesday sued in Wisconsin to get his name removed from the presidential ballot there after the state elections commission voted to keep him on it.

Sanduja warned that Harris could destabilize Indo-US relations. ""If Kamala becomes the president, she might appoint liberal judges who could overturn critical Supreme Court decisions affecting Asian-American voters,"" he said.Sanduja also criticized the Biden-Harris administration’s handling of border security.

Aysenur Ezgi Eygi , a 26-year-old Turkish-American activist, was shot and killed on Friday while participating in an anti-settlement protest in Beita, a town in the occupied West Bank . Eygi, a member of the International Solidarity Movement (ISM), was reportedly struck in the head by Israeli gunfire. This incident has sparked international condemnation and calls for an investigation.Turkey swiftly condemned the killing, attributing it to ""Israeli occupation soldiers"" and calling the act ""barbaric."" President Recep Tayyip Erdogan expressed outrage over the death, emphasizing the need for accountability.The United States, while describing the event as ""tragic,"" has called on Israel to conduct a thorough investigation. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre stated, ""We are deeply disturbed by the tragic death of an American citizen,"" urging transparency and action from Israeli authorities.The United Nations Human Rights Office has directly accused Israeli forces of killing Eygi, asserting that she was ""shot in the head and killed."" The UN has emphasized that Eygi was part of a ""peaceful anti-settlement protest,"" highlighting the broader context of ongoing tensions in the region. Hospital director Fouad Nafaa confirmed Eygi's arrival at Rafidia hospital with a fatal gunshot wound.Eygi's death occurred amid heightened tensions following a 10-day Israeli military raid in Jenin, another flashpoint in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The raid, part of broader Israeli military operations, has been widely criticized internationally. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has warned against escalating military actions in the West Bank, underscoring the need for a diplomatic solution.The violence in the West Bank has been exacerbated by the ongoing Gaza war, with significant casualties reported on both sides. Since October 7, when Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on southern Israel, Israeli troops or settlers have killed at least 662 Palestinians, while 23 Israelis have died in Palestinian attacks.Hamas condemned Eygi's killing as a ""crime committed by the Zionist occupation army,"" while Hussein al-Sheikh of the Palestine Liberation Organization called for international accountability. Al-Sheikh remarked on X, ""Another crime added to the series of crimes committed daily by the occupation forces,"" pressing for justice through international courts.As Israeli forces reportedly withdraw from Jenin, the situation remains tense. The UN reported 36 Palestinians killed during the raid, including eight children. Meanwhile, diplomatic efforts continue, with the US and key allies like Qatar and Egypt working to negotiate a truce in the Gaza war. Despite these efforts, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has disputed the progress of negotiations, highlighting ongoing disagreements over military and diplomatic terms.As the international community grapples with the fallout from Eygi's death and the broader conflict, the urgent need for a sustainable resolution becomes increasingly clear. The focus now shifts to the response from Israeli authorities and the potential impact on the fragile peace process in the region.","Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, a 26-year-old Turkish-American activist, was shot and killed on Friday.

In the latest development, Georgia officials arrested Colin Gray , father of 14-year-old Colt Gray , who is accused of carrying out the deadly shooting at Apalachee High School . The shooting left four dead and nine injured.Investigators revealed Colt used an AR-15-style rifle in the attack, a firearm purchased by his father as a Christmas gift. As per the report by the Post, the rifle was given from father to son as a gift just seven months after authorities paid the pair a visit in May when the FBI received tips about online school shooting threats.The teen was interviewed after the sheriff received a tip from the FBI that Gray, then 13, “had possibly threatened to shoot up a middle school tomorrow.” The threat was made on Discord, a social media platform popular with video gamers, according to the sheriff's office incident report.Despite past investigations into threats made by Colt online, law enforcement had found no substantial evidence to act at the time.Sheriff Janis Mangum explained the earlier investigation: “The case was worked thoroughly last year, but at the time, the evidence wasn’t strong enough to confiscate their weapons.”Colin had assured authorities that his son had no unsupervised access to the family’s hunting guns, but that assurance has since proven tragically insufficient.The FBI's tip pointed to a Discord account associated with an email address linked to Colt Gray, the report said. But the boy said “he would never say such a thing, even in a joking manner,” according to the investigator's report.The interview transcript quotes the teen as saying: “I promise I would never say something where ...” with the rest of that denial listed as inaudible.“He knows the seriousness of weapons and what they can do, and how to use them and not use them,” the father, Colin Gray, said according to a transcript obtained from the sheriff's office.Authorities are now focusing on how Colt accessed the weapon and whether earlier warning signs could have prevented the attack.Authorities have now charged Colt as an adult with murder, accusing him of using a semiautomatic rifle to kill four and injure nine others. He had a history of struggling with his parent's separation and was often bullied, his father told investigators last year. Despite those issues, the teen frequently went hunting with his father, who described the ""greatest day ever"" when Colt shot his first deer.Colt and his father had been interviewed after the FBI tipped authorities about the teen possibly threatening to shoot up a school. The investigator's report noted inconsistencies, including the fact that the Discord account had been accessed in multiple locations, including Buffalo, New York, and featured profile details written in Russian. Despite the concerning behavior, no arrests were made due to a lack of evidence.Colin Gray, Colt’s father, admitted that guns were accessible in their home, but claimed they were unloaded. Colt had been photographed with blood smeared on his cheeks from hunting trips, further emphasizing the family's exposure to firearms.The shooting began when Colt left his Algebra class and tried to re-enter, but a student saw the gun and refused to let him in. He then turned to a nearby classroom and opened fire, firing 10 to 15 rounds.""I think he wanted to come to us first,"" His classmate, Lyela Sayarath, said, reported CNN.The first reports of an active shooter came in at around 10:20 am (local time) School resource officers and law enforcement quickly responded, and Colt was taken into custody after a brief confrontation.""I heard gunshots outside my classroom and people screaming, people begging not to get shot,"" said 14-year-old Macey Right. ""And then people sitting beside me (were) just shaking and crying.""The mass shooting at Apalachee High School marks the 30th such incident in the US this year.The shooting claimed the lives of two 14-year-old students, Christian Angulo and Mason Schermerhorn, as well as two beloved teachers, math teacher Christina Irimie and assistant football coach Richard Aspinwall.“We are truly heartbroken,” Christian’s older sister, Lisette Angulo, shared on a GoFundMe page to support the family.Apalachee Football also expressed their grief for Aspinwall: “To our beloved defensive coordinator Ricky Aspinwall, we will carry you heavy in our hearts.”Colt Gray, the 14-year-old accused of carrying out the deadly shooting at Apalachee High School, had denied ever threatening a school attack when interviewed by authorities in 2023. Jackson County Sheriff Janis Mangum defended the investigation from last year, saying, ""We did not drop the ball at all on this. We did all we could do with what we had at the time."" The interview followed an FBI tip about a threat made on Discord, but conflicting evidence prevented an arrest.The faculty’s quick actions, paired with newly implemented safety protocols like the Centegix alert system, likely prevented the tragedy from being even worse. “The protocols in this school and this system activated today prevented this from being a much larger tragedy than what we had,” said Georgia Bureau of Investigations Director Chris Hosey.The mass shooting at Apalachee High School marks the 30th such incident in the US this year.Colt had previously been investigated for threats made online in 2023, including an ominous reference to Sandy Hook shooter Adam Lanza. While both Colt and his father denied any intent to commit violence, the case was closed due to insufficient evidence.“The 13-year-old denied making the threats online,” Sheriff Mangum said in a Facebook post. However, the recent tragedy has reopened scrutiny into whether enough was done at the time.Colt Gray, currently in custody, is being held without bond and will be tried as an adult on charges of felony murder. His first court appearance is set for Friday, and investigators are piecing together how the gun was brought to school and if anyone else was involved in planning the attack.As the Apalachee High School community grapples with the shock of the incident, students like Macey express their fears about returning to school. “I really don’t want to go back. I feel like I shouldn’t have to go back to school worrying about dying.”","Colt Gray, 14, is accused of carrying out the deadly shooting at Apalachee High School.

Isolated in luxury: What we know about Russian President Putin's 'secret sons',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/isolated-in-luxury-what-we-know-about-russian-president-putins-secret-sons/articleshow/113111549.cms,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly kept his two sons hidden from the public eye for years, treating their existence as a closely guarded state secret.Recent revelations by a Russian investigative journalism website have shed light on Putin's long-rumored relationship with former Olympic gymnast Alina Kabaeva.The Dossier Center reported that the couple has two sons, Ivan, 9, and Vladimir Jr., 5, who reside in a heavily guarded mansion near Lake Valdai, north-west of Moscow.The boys live an isolated life of luxury, surrounded by nannies, governesses, and personal trainers, and are protected by the Kremlin's Federal Protective Service. They have never attended school and are instead educated by a team of private tutors.The young Putins' lives are shrouded in secrecy, with their identities hidden from official databases and their birth dates known only to close relatives.Kabaeva gave birth to Ivan in a private Swiss clinic in 2015, while Vladimir Jr. was born in Moscow in 2019. The Russian-born gynaecologist who delivered both boys passed away last year under mysterious circumstances.Despite their privileged upbringing, the boys lead a sheltered existence, with limited opportunities for social interaction. They have an extensive collection of toys and pets but can only play with each other or the adults in their household, the Daily Mail reported.Putin occasionally plays ice hockey with Ivan but always on the same team. The boys follow a strict daily routine, with meals prepared by personal chefs and served by dedicated waiters. They have access to private gym facilities and swimming pools, with personal coaches for each activity.The young Putins spend their summers on luxury yachts in the Gulf of Finland and the Black Sea coast, accompanied by their teachers and staff. They travel exclusively by private jet or armored train. Their parents have sought English teachers from countries sympathetic to Russia , with staff required to live in isolation and undergo a two-week quarantine before starting work.Putin has at least three other children, including two adult daughters from his previous marriage and a love-child from an affair with a cleaner. The intense secrecy surrounding his sons with Kabaeva may stem from his background as a former KGB officer, his sensitivity about his relationship with Kabaeva, and heightened security concerns following the Ukraine invasion.The revelations about Putin's sons have been met with mixed reactions from the Russian public, particularly as the country grapples with the loss of tens of thousands of its own sons in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.","Vladimir Putin has two sons, Ivan, 9, and Vladimir Jr., 5, with former Olympic gymnast Alina Kabaeva.

Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are virtually tied in key battleground states , according to a YouGov poll conducted for The Times and SAY24. The survey, covering August 23 to September 3, highlighted a close race with Harris leading in four swing states while Trump edged ahead in three, all within the margin of error, reported The Hill.Harris held a slight edge in Michigan, Nevada, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania.The poll showed her leading by five points in Michigan (48% to 43%), three points in both Nevada (49% to 46%) and Wisconsin (47% to 44%). In Pennsylvania, she led by just one point (46% to 45%) among registered voters.Trump, on the other hand, led in Georgia, Arizona, and North Carolina. His leads were narrow, with a two-point advantage in both Arizona (47% to 45%) and Georgia (47% to 45%). In North Carolina, he was slightly ahead with 47% support compared to Harris’s 46%.Carl Bialik, Vice President of Data Science at YouGov, commented, “Even compared to March, Harris was running ahead or even in each state. She was performing on par with or better than Biden’s 2020 results in these battlegrounds.” He added, “If these leads held and the rest of the states voted similarly to 2020, Harris would have won the electoral college.”CNN’s recent polling showed no decisive lead in Georgia, Nevada, and Pennsylvania, with Harris ahead by 50% to 44% in Wisconsin and 48% to 43% in Michigan. Conversely, Trump has a five-point lead in Arizona (49% to 44%).According to The Hill/Decision Desk HQ, Harris led Trump by 4 percentage points (49.7% to 45.7%) in aggregate polls.

Justice Asim Hafiz, who delivered the verdict, noted that the process was illegal.""Lest anyone misunderstand this, we make it clear that the appointment to any post under the government can only be made after a proper advertisement has been made, inviting applications from eligible candidates. Without holding a proper selection where all eligible candidates get a fair chance to compete would violate the guarantee enshrined under Articles 18 and 27 of the Constitution,"" Hafiz said.""I am afraid that illegality committed by way of an unauthorized appointment, one cannot hide the elephant in a mouse-hole,"" the judge added.The ruling is considered unusual given the powerful role the Pakistan army has traditionally played in the country, including periods of military rule in its more than 75 years of existence.Experts say the high court's decision might be seen as a setback for those who support the current regime, as the military often seeks to place its personnel in major civil positions.",Afsar became the first serving military officer to head Nadra in October 2023.

His arrest, however, has been seen by the opposition as a ploy to implicate Imran in cases linked to May 9 riots. This apprehension had prompted Khan to approach the Islamabad high court on Tuesday, pleading to stop civilian authorities from handing him over to the military. “A few weeks ago, a retired senior army officer (Faiz Hameed) was taken into military custody. It has been widely speculated and reported in the media that he will be made an approver against the petitioner (Imran Khan) in cases pertaining to May 9 and 10, 2023 and the petitioner will be transferred to military custody on this basis,” the petition read.Govt officials have repeatedly said Hameed worked with Khan to plan the riots.Addressing a press conference in Rawalpindi, army’s spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said the law takes its own course if a person from the Pakistani army works for personal gain or promotes a specific agenda.“The case of Gen Hameed is a clear example that the army takes violations of its rules very seriously. He (Hameed) had overstepped his legal and constitutional boundaries at the behest of certain political elements,” Chaudhary said.He said Gen Hameed’s case was referred to the Pakistani army through the defence ministry in light of a “full belief in the army’s accountability process”, following which the army ordered a “high-level court of inquiry” into the matter.“There is a clear consensus within the army that it is a national, state-owned institution, which must be prevented from being used against the completion of goals related to specific political agendas.”Khan is being currently tried in a civil court for allegedly abetting the violence on May 9, 2023, a charge he has denied.",Court martial proceedings against former ISI chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (retd) were initiated. Allegations are linked to cases filed after Imran's supporters went on a rampage last year following his arrest.

Pak: Islamabad HC registrar objects to Imran Khan's plea against possible military trial,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pak-islamabad-hc-registrar-objects-to-imran-khans-plea-against-possible-military-trial/articleshow/113051406.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad high court registrar's office has raised objections on a petition filed by former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan in the Islamabad high court (IHC) to stop his potential military trial in connection with the May 9 cases, Geo News reported.Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan's plea filed under Article 199 of the constitution comes amid speculations about his military trial in a military court.The IHC registrar's office questioned how the petitioner seeks relief without mentioning any specific first information report (FIR). It mentioned that no documentation or order has been attached to the petition. The registrar's office asked how the petitions can be filed in the Islamabad high court when cases have been filed in Punjab.Furthermore, the IHC registrar's office questioned how the petition can be filed in a high court while the matter of military trials is subjudice in the supreme court , according to a Geo News report.Speaking to reporters, Imran Khan's lawyer, Intezar Panjutha said that they talked to the PTI founder regarding his plea in the IHC. ""Nothing is more crucial that an ex-prime minister is being dragged to a military court. How can the leader of a popular political party be taken to a military court,"" Panjutha quoted the the PTI founder as saying.Panjutha further stated that a civilian cannot be tried in a military court in the light of a Supreme Court verdict. Last week, Pakistan's Federal minister for law and justice Senator Azam Nazeer Tarar, said that if needed, the Punjab government would take a decision on referring the PTI founder's case to a military court.In an informal talk with reporters on August 29, Tarar said, ""The prosecution of May 9 cases is being done by the Punjab government and the provincial government will decide to refer the case to a military court,"" Geo News reported, citing The News International.Earlier in August, Pakistan Defence Minister Khawaja Asif hinted at the possibility of Imran Khan's trial in military court for the May 9 riots. Asif made the remarks in response to former Pakistan PM Imran Khan's demand for an ""open trial"" of former inter-services intelligence chief (retd) Faiz Hamid.Violent protests erupted in Pakistan after Imran Khan was arrested from the premises of Islamabad High Court in a graft case on May 9, 2023. During the protests, the alleged PTI supporters vandalised military installations, including General Headquarters in Rawalpindi, and were involved in arson at the Lahore Corps commander house.In December 2021, the supreme court in a 5:1 majority verdict suspended its October 23, 2023 order wherein it declared civilians' trials in military courts null and void in connection with the May 9 riots, Geo News reported.The court's verdict came after intra-court appeals were filed by the federal and provincial governments and the defence ministry against the top court's decision announced by Justice Ijazul Ahsan-led bench earlier that year.According to the order issued on December 13, the military court trials would be conditioned on the Supreme Court's final verdict on the intra-court pleas.","The Islamabad high court registrar's office has raised objections on a petition filed by former Pakistan PM Imran Khan.

They were protesting against alleged immoral activities in the area, which they claimed were being facilitated by local police and officials. The protesters also forcibly shut down businesses and threatened traders with severe consequences.When police intervened and invoked Section 144 of the CrPC, which bans gatherings, the demonstrators responded with hostility, Dawn state in its report. They attacked police officers with batons and sticks, damaged official vehicles, and used weapons to enforce the closure of business centers.Jamia Hafsa is a conservative madrassa adjacent to the controversial Lal Masjid mosque in Islamabad.The Lal Masjid controversy in Pakistan is a complex and contentious episode that unfolded primarily in 2007, involving a prominent mosque in Islamabad known for its association with Islamist radicalism. The mosque had increasingly become a centre of militant activity and anti-government sentiment, Dawn stated.Per Dawn's report, in response to the mosque's growing defiance and the enforcement of its version of Sharia law in the surrounding areas, the Pakistani government, under President Pervez Musharraf , launched Operation Silence . This military operation aimed to reclaim control from the militants who had fortified themselves within the mosque.The operation, marked by intense fighting and heavy casualties, drew significant criticism from Islamic groups, who condemned the military's tactics and the resultant civilian suffering. The aftermath of the operation exacerbated anti-government sentiment and contributed to the rise of extremist militancy in Pakistan, highlighting the deep-seated tensions between religious extremism, state authority, and public sentiment, Dawn reported.","The charges were filed at the Lohi Bher police station under Section 11-X of the Anti-Terrorism Act and various sections of the Pakistan Penal Code.

Furthermore, 150 people were injured in various incidents, with 88 of them being civilians.The majority of fatalities in Pakistan were attributed to 83 militant attacks , which resulted in the deaths of 175 individuals, including 92 civilians, 47 security personnel, and 36 militants. Additionally, 123 people were injured, with 88 civilians and 35 security personnel among them. August has been noted as the deadliest month since July 2018.Reports from other Baloch human rights organizations highlighted that Quetta, Kech, Awaran, and Khuzdar experienced the highest numbers of enforced disappearances , with these districts reporting 10, eight, seven, and six incidents, respectively.The situation in Balochistan is marked by significant challenges and unrest. The region has faced a surge in violence, with frequent militant attacks and ongoing extrajudicial killings. The security situation remains volatile, contributing to a heightened level of instability and human rights abuses. Despite international and local efforts to address these issues, Balochistan continues to grapple with severe human rights violations and a deteriorating security environment.The human rights situation is dire, characterized by ongoing conflict between separatist groups and the government, which has led to violence and military operations. Enforced disappearances are a serious issue, with many individuals being taken by security forces and held without charge. Freedom of expression is severely restricted, with journalists and activists facing threats and suppression, the report stated.Despite being resource-rich, the province remains economically marginalized, contributing to local grievances. Additionally, the conflict has caused significant internal and cross-border displacement. The lack of effective legal recourse and accountability for human rights abuses further exacerbates the problem, making the situation complex and deeply troubling.","August has been the most violent month in Balochistan in the past six years.

Anti-terror op turns sinister: Pakistani netizens being 'walled off' as army raises spectre of 'digital terrorism',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/anti-terror-op-turns-sinister-pakistani-netizens-being-walled-off-as-army-raises-spectre-of-digital-terrorism/articleshow/112898501.cms,"Munir's repeated attacks on social media

Imran's ouster & rise of digital activism

National internet firewall

NEW DELHI: Pakistan 's ""whole-of-system approach"" to countering militancy is evolving and may be taking a turn to the sinister as its army's new anti-terror operation ' Azm-e-Istehkam ' (Resolve for Stability) is increasingly focusing on what it calls "" digital terrorism "".Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir has over the past few months repeatedly warned that digital platforms are being exploited to disseminate misinformation and incite unrest against state institutions.He described the activities of ""inimical"" forces as a form of ""digital terrorism"" aimed at creating discord between the military and the public by spreading ""lies and fake news"".Launched in June, Azm-e-Istehkam is tackling not only traditional militancy, particularly in light of increasing attacks attributed to groups like the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), but the evolving nature of threats in the digital landscape.The shift has sparked widespread concern with some analysts suggesting that the military is carrying out ""prejudiced online surveillance"" and curbing internet speeds across the country to battle the new ""digital threat"".The characterisation of digital terrorism in Munir's speeches have been notably vague, with rights activists noting that the term lacks a clear legal definition and could be weaponised against individuals who express criticism of the military or government policies online.In recent months, Munir has repeatedly voiced ""concerns"" regarding the impact of social media on national security and public discourse.In May -- just months before launching Azm-e-Istehkam -- Munir highlighted the issue of ""negative propaganda"" on social media, asserting that it poses threats to the integrity and security of Pakistan. He emphasised the military's readiness to counter any conspiracies and condemned the spread of disinformation, urging adherence to constitutional limits on freedom of expression, particularly as outlined in Article 19 of the Constitution of Pakistan, which restricts incitement to violence and undermining national security.In August, Munir reiterated these concerns, stating that social media is being exploited to propagate ""anarchy"" and warned against campaigns targeting the military. His remarks came in the context of rising tensions and comparisons being drawn to political instability in neighboring countries.On August 14, he again criticised the misuse of social media for spreading chaos and false information, attributing ""digital terrorism"" to foreign elements. He stressed the state's responsibility to protect citizens from the adverse effects of social media-driven hysteria and urged the public to remain vigilant against misinformation.He also warned that social media was being exploited to propagate ""anarchy"". His remarks that ""anarchy is spread through social media"" followed a condemnation by the army of social media campaigns to target the Pakistan Armed Forces.""Just as terrorists use weapons to get their demands met, digital terrorists use negative propaganda and fake news on social media platforms, mobiles and computers to create despondency to get their demands met,"" Pakistani military spokesperson Lt. Gen. Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry had said.Chaudhry said the military had become the sole target of digital terrorists, and blamed a ""certain"" political party without naming ousted PM Imran Khan ’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf party, which has a formidable social media presence.Imran Khan has repeatedly accused the military for orchestrating his removal from power in April 2022, and specifically named Munir as being responsible for his subsequent arrest in May 2023, claiming the Army chief harboured a ""personal grudge"" against him.Khan also alleged that Munir was behind the crackdown on his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), stating: ""It is personal. It's got nothing to do with national interest"". He also accused Munir of ""dismantling the future of this country [Pakistan] to protect himself"".Khan's arrest led to riots in May where protesters for the first time in the nation's history vented their anger on the military attacking several army installations.Digital activism in Pakistan spiked following Imran's ouster, whose party has relied heavily on social media to coordinate its activities. After TV channels were banned from covering PTI events, Khan gave several speeches online challenging the military's role in politics.These online events were often marred by internet blackouts or slowdown. Though authorities have said the drop in internet speed was due to technical issues, activists have claimed that the army is strategically using a national firewall and manipulating the country's internet infrastructure to curb any dissenting voices on the web.Pakistan has experienced a notable slowdown in internet speeds over the past few months, with reports indicating that up to 40% slower speeds have affected nearly half of the country's 241 million internet users.Users have reported difficulties in sending and receiving messages on platforms like WhatsApp and accessing social media sites, which are crucial for communication and information dissemination, especially among the youth and political activists.Information Technology minister Shiza Fatima Khawaja has confirmed that it was upgrading its ""web management system"" to cope with cybersecurity threats but did not link the development to slower internet speeds.TOI has reported that the Pakistan government tested its firewall on two occasions, once in July and a second time in mid-August. Pakistan has allocated more than $70 million for a Digital Infrastructure Development Initiative in the latest budget.The timing of these frequent slowdowns also coincides with the launch of operation Azm-e-Istehkam, raising questions about whether the internet disruptions are also linked to efforts to control information amid rising political tensions and protests against the military's actions.Technology experts have suggested that the newly implemented internet firewall could provide the government with enhanced capabilities to censor online content, drawing comparisons to China's stringent internet regulations.Countries like China, Iran, Turkiye, and Russia have employed national firewalls for years to regulate internet content, saying they aim to pinpoint and restrict sources of propaganda content.","Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir has repeatedly warned that digital platforms are being exploited to disseminate misinformation and incite unrest against state institutions.
