Pakistan Senate Session-349 (Day-04) 29-04-2025

As India and Pakistan grapple with renewed tensions after the deadly Pahalgam terror attack , a video of Pakistani Senator Palwasha Mohammad Zai Khan making provocative remarks in Pakistan parliament has gone viral, fuelling diplomatic ire and social media outrage.In a fiery speech delivered in Pakistan’s Upper House on April 29, the senator declared, “The first brick of the new Babri mosque in Ayodhya will be laid by Pakistan Army soldiers, and the first azaan will be given by Army Chief Asim Munir himself.”The comments, invoking the Babri mosque demolished in 1992, came as part of a broader tirade laced with religious and militaristic rhetoric. Palwasha Khan, a member of the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and deputy information secretary, suggested that the path was being laid for a “Muslim government, specifically a Pakistani Muslim government, in the Indian subcontinent.”“There is no doubt, this enmity is not with Pakistan or Pakistanis; this is enmity against Muslims and against Islam,” she said.Issuing a direct threat to India, she warned, “The Senate of Pakistan must send a message, if any hand reaches toward us, then the symbol of their power, the Red Fort of Delhi, will witness a bloodshed that its walls have never seen, and its ramparts will testify to it for centuries to come.”Khan, who represents Sindh in the Senate and previously served in the National Assembly from 2008 to 2013, emphasized that Pakistanis were not weak. “We are not wearing bangles,” she said.Quoting late Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez , she added, “We have guns, we have arms, we have trees—and if the enemy tries anything, we will hang their corpses from our trees.”Despite the hostile language, she claimed to have no quarrel with Indian citizens. “But let me be clear: we have no enmity with the people of India.”Khan also attempted to draw religious divides within the Indian armed forces, asserting, “The Sikh army will not attack Pakistan because it’s the land of Guru Nanak for them.”She went on to praise Khalistani separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannu, who is a designated terrorist under Indian law. “I want to salute Sikh leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannu, who courageously declared that no Indian soldier will be allowed to cross into Pakistan from Indian Punjab.”Ending her speech with a call to arms, the senator proclaimed, “Our army is not just six or seven lakh soldiers, we have 250 million people who, when the time comes, will stand shoulder to shoulder with our armed forces and become soldiers themselves, God willing.”The speech has since circulated widely on social media platforms, drawing sharp reactions amid the already strained ties between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.","Pakistani Senator Palwasha Mohammad Zai Khan made provocative remarks in Pakistan parliament.

Yet, today the community finds itself orphaned once again in the national conscience,” Tickoo said.Alleging that “the so-called candle march brigades” have not lifted a finger or spoken a word to recognise the renewed existential threat to the community, he said: “Let it be amply clear that a callous attitude on part of either the Union govt or the local administration is no longer an option. Prevention, protection and proactive safeguarding measures are the only workable options left. This is not just about increased deployment of quick reaction teams or increased security measures; this is about making our right to life, dignity and presence in our own ancestral land non-negotiable.”“The Kashmiri Pandit community has maintained the civilisational spirit of Kashmir for centuries. But if the State lets us down once again, history will note not only the silence of our oppressors but also the indifference of those constitutionally bound to defend us,” Tickoo said.","Kashmiri Pandit organisation on Wednesday threatened permanent migration of the community from Kashmir Valley. “We are seriously concerned and pained to the core with the recent intelligence reports suggesting an imminent danger to Kashmiri Pandits and non-Muslim migrant labourers in Kashmir Valley,” Sanjay Tickoo said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120774049,imgsize-1431966,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Like Father, Like Son



Khalistanis Lose



There’s a maxim that goes:The opposite is also true —And while the main story of the last Canadian election was that the Liberals managed to win after dropping Justin Trudeau like a stale waffle, the tangent that matters most for New Delhi is the amputation of the Khalistani gangrene that had infected Canadian politics.Not so long ago, Canadian politicians embraced Khalistanis with the enthusiasm of uncles hugging the bartender at a wedding reception. But if the 2025 result is any indication, the times are a-changin’.Let’s rewind.The Khalistan movement was born in blood and delusion. In the 1980s, it took tens of thousands of Indian lives, culminating in the assassination of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and the bombing of Air India Flight 182, which also killed scores of Canadian citizens. It was a terror attack that shook the world, long before 9/11.It was terrorism dressed up as liberation. And while the fires died down in Punjab, they kept flickering in suburban gurdwaras across the West. Diaspora extremism exported a failed revolution — foreign passports in one hand, anti-India posters in the other.Enter Canada: the Disneyland of diaspora radicalism. Trudeau’s Liberals treated Sikh extremism not as a national security threat, but as an ethnic mood board for vote-bank politics. His office deleted references to Sikh extremism from terrorism reports. Cabinet ministers smiled beside float parades featuring Indira Gandhi’s assassination. And when known terrorists like Gurpatwant Singh Pannun threatened violence, Trudeau’s government responded with mumbling about ""freedom of expression.""Then came Hardeep Singh Nijjar. When the Khalistani terrorist was gunned down in 2023, Trudeau broke diplomatic sound barriers to accuse India — without a shred of proof, a move that backfired spectacularly and made him a global meme, thanks mostly to the perennially online members of India armed with the world’s cheapest internet and knowledge of English. In fact, if one simply read about Nijjar from Canadian or American outlets, one would have assumed Nijjar was a loving plumber who doubled up as an activist, gurdwara worker, and scrubber of kitchens — which all failed to mention that Nijjar had even gone to Pakistan for arms training.Of course, the son's move was hardly surprising, considering that Pierre Trudeau had once refused to extradite Talwinder Singh Parmar — a prominent Khalistani terrorist and co-founder of Babbar Khalsa International. Parmar was wanted in India for the murder of two Punjab Police officers. The Canadian government's refusal hinged on the technicality that India recognised the British monarch only as Head of the Commonwealth, not as Head of State. Canada argued that the Commonwealth extradition protocols therefore didn’t apply. Parmar remained in Canada and went on to mastermind the 1985 Air India Flight 182 bombing — the deadliest terrorist attack in Canadian history, killing 329 people, including 268 Canadian citizens. Trudeau's own intelligence chiefs later admitted they had no hard evidence. His Five Eyes allies blinked nervously. Even the Americans — never shy of sticking fingers into sovereign pies — politely urged Canada cooperate.India, meanwhile, acted like the adult in the room. It didn’t roar. It didn’t flinch. It simply waited — like a seasoned poker player watching a drunk bluff on an empty hand. Trudeau expelled Indian diplomats. India returned the favour. Trade talks froze. Visas stalled. And Ottawa suddenly realised that when you pick a fight with the world’s fifth-largest economy, you’d better have more than just moral indignation.And then the collapse came. Jagmeet Singh , the turbaned torchbearer of Khalistani sympathy, went from kingmaker to cautionary tale. He lost his seat . It was a fitting end for a politician whose rise to NDP leadership raised some questions over the leadership process.Back in 2017, Jagmeet Singh won the NDP leadership largely on the strength of new members signed up by his campaign — a victory some party veterans quietly questioned. While overall turnout was just 52.8%, Singh’s recruits showed up in force, handing him 53.8% on the first ballot. The three other candidates, backed more by traditional NDP members, were left trailing. It was an early sign of how identity politics and bloc sign-ups could tilt the internal balance of Canadian parties — and, in Singh’s case, how factions sympathetic to Khalistani rhetoric could find their way to the top through mobilisation rather than broad consensus.Come 2025, and the NDP lost official party status. Voters made it clear: backing separatist rhetoric isn’t multiculturalism — it’s madness. The Liberal Party, already battered by amateur-hour foreign policy, watched Trudeau shuffle off into political sunset, his India gambit having detonated in his face.But let’s not kid ourselves. The rot wasn’t limited to the Liberals. All Canadian parties — from Poilievre’s Conservatives to Singh’s NDP — played footsie with extremism. No one wanted to say the quiet part out loud: that Khalistani ideology, once draped in the language of rights and victimhood, had mutated into a cover for hate politics. Posters calling for violence against Indian diplomats. Temple attacks. Social media clips declaring Canada a settler state that must be decolonised — by whose army, one wonders?The intellectual decay ran even deeper. Canadian gurdwaras ran “referendums” on Punjab's independence with the zeal of a rogue polling booth. Academia became a launchpad for agitprop masquerading as scholarship. Cultural events hosted masked radicals shouting slogans louder than their logic. Meanwhile, Indian consulates were stormed, Hindu temples graffitied — and Ottawa responded with bromides about tolerance.Through it all, India played the long game. Officials repeated a single line like a mantra: “We have not received any credible evidence.” Translated: prove it or pipe down.Now, with Trudeau out, Mark Carney in, and a battered NDP nursing its wounds, New Delhi will smile quietly at the long game it has played in this diplomatic kerfuffle where it refused to give Canada the legitimacy it sought. When PM Narendra Modi tweeted post the election to congratulate Mark Carney, there was a particular phrase that found its way into the official wording.One assumes quiet diplomacy will be underway soon as India and Canada recalibrate after the flights of fancy of the Trudeau era.Let’s be clear: this was never about all Sikhs. It was about a fringe movement that hijacked microphones in gurdwaras, manipulated victimhood, and wore the garb of human rights while chanting the slogans of insurrection. They paraded images of Indira Gandhi’s assassination not as history, but as prophecy. They treated terror as theatre. And for too long, Canada applauded from the balcony.But the curtain has now fallen. The West’s most Khalistan-friendly democracy just issued a political restraining order. India didn’t gloat. It didn’t need to. The Khalistan project in Canada didn’t end with a bang. It ended with a ballot — and a very loud silence from Ottawa. Good riddance to bad proxies. As Hillary Clinton famously said all those years ago when words mattered in the corridors of power: ""You can't keep snakes in your backyard and expect them to only bite your neighbour."" Hopefully, it’s a lesson Canada will heed going forward.","The Khalistan movement was born in blood and delusion.

US government's new policy terminates international students' legal status,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-governments-new-policy-terminates-international-students-legal-status/articleshow/120747708.cms,"File Photo (Photo: AP)

Poll Do you support the recent crackdown on international students in the US? No, it unfairly targets innocent students. Yes, it's necessary for security.

Washington, Apr 30 (AP) The US government has begun shedding new light on a crackdown on international students, spelling out how it targeted thousands of people and laying out the grounds for terminating their legal status. The new details emerged in lawsuits filed by some of the students who suddenly had their status cancelled in recent weeks with little explanation.In the past month, foreign students around the US have been rattled to learn their records had been removed from a student database maintained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement . Some went into hiding for fear of being picked up by immigration authorities or abandoned their studies to return home.On Friday, after mounting court challenges, federal officials said the government was restoring international students' legal status while it developed a framework to guide future terminations. In a court filing Monday, it shared the new policy: a document issued over the weekend with guidance on a range of reasons students' status can be cancelled, including the revocation of the visas they used to enter the USBrad Banias, an immigration attorney representing a student whose status was terminated, said the new guidelines vastly expand ICE's authority beyond previous policy, which did not count visa revocation as grounds for losing legal status.""This just gave them carte blanche to have the State Department revoke a visa and then deport those students even if they've done nothing wrong,"" Banias said.Many of the students who had visas revoked or lost their legal status said they had only minor infractions on their record, including driving infractions. Some did not know why they were targeted at all.Lawyers for the government provided some explanation at a hearing Tuesday in the case of Banias' client Akshar Patel, an international student studying information systems in Texas. Patel's status was terminated - and then reinstated - this month, and he is seeking a preliminary court ruling to keep him from being deported.In court filings and in the hearing, Department of Homeland Security officials said they ran the names of student visa holders through the National Crime Information Center, an FBI-run database that contains reams of information related to crimes. It includes the names of suspects, missing persons and people who have been arrested, even if they have never been charged with a crime or had charges dropped.In total, about 6,400 students were identified in the database search, US District Judge Ana Reyes said in the hearing Tuesday. One of the students was Patel, who had been pulled over and charged with reckless driving in 2018. The charge was ultimately dropped - information that is also in NCIC.Patel appears in a spreadsheet with 734 students whose names had come up in NCIC. That spreadsheet was forwarded to a Homeland Security official, who, within 24 hours of receiving it, replied: ""Please terminate all in SEVIS."" That's a different database listing foreigners who have legal status as students in the US.Reyes said the short time frame suggested that no one had reviewed the records individually to find out why the students' names came up in NCIC.""All of this could have been avoided if someone had taken a beat,"" said Reyes, who was appointed by President Joe Biden. She said the government had demonstrated ""an utter lack of concern for individuals who have come into this country.""When colleges discovered the students no longer had legal status, it prompted chaos and confusion. In the past, college officials say, legal statuses typically were updated after colleges told the government the students were no longer studying at the school. In some cases, colleges told students to stop working or taking classes and warned them they could be deported.Still, government attorneys said the change in the database did not mean the students actually lost legal status, even though some of the students were labeled ""failure to maintain status."" Instead, lawyers said, it was intended to be an ""investigative red flag.""""Mr. Patel is lawfully present in the US,"" Andre Watson of the Department of Homeland Security said. ""He is not subject to immediate detention or removal.""Reyes declined to issue a preliminary injunction and urged lawyers from both sides to come to a settlement to ensure Patel could stay in the US.","Federal officials say they ran the names of student visa holders through the National Crime Information Center, an FBI-run database.

What is the truth of Garcia's tattoos?



President Donald Trump at one point during his ABC interview attacked Terry Moran and said he picked him for the interview because he had never heard of him. ""I picked you because, frankly, I never heard of you, but that's OK.

""Hey, Terry. Terry, Terry. Don't do that... It says M-S-1-3,"" Trump said. Moran then responded: ""That was Photoshopped.""""That was Photoshopped?

Thereported the UK Foreign Office warned that several human rights barristers could be slapped with sanctions by the Trump administration and Amal Clooney is one of them.A former senior British judge, Lord Justice Adrian Fulford, the Labour peer Baroness Helena Kennedy of the Shaws, and Danny Friedman, a barrister at Matrix Chambers, are also at risk.In February, Trump sanctioned the ICC and ordered that ICC officials, employees and their immediate family members should be hit with financial penalties and visa restrictions. Last year, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity.

Meghan Markle’s use of ‘HRH’ sparks new royal feud as Prince William plans to revoke titles when he becomes king: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/meghan-markles-use-of-hrh-sparks-new-royal-feud-as-prince-william-plans-to-revoke-titles-when-he-becomes-king-report/articleshow/120782899.cms,"A fresh royal showdown may be looming as Prince William reportedly plans to permanently strip Prince Harry and Meghan Markle of their “HRH” (His or Her Royal Highness) styles once he ascends to the throne, a move insiders say reflects his growing frustration with the Sussexes’ continued ties to royal status.According to a Daily Beast report published Tuesday, William was incensed after Meghan used the “HRH” style in a personal note accompanying a gift basket, and after a Ukrainian official publicly addressed her as “Your Royal Highness” in a letter she later shared online. Though Meghan and Harry agreed not to use the style after stepping back from royal duties in 2020, they were never formally stripped of it, a distinction that now appears to be at the center of renewed controversy.The terms of their 2020 exit, known as the Sandringham Agreement, said the couple would no longer use the “HRH” designation “as they are no longer working members of the Royal Family.” But Meghan’s recent correspondence appears to have tested that boundary.One former courtier told The Daily Beast the Sussexes’ interpretation of the agreement is “complete rubbish,” adding, “They had agreed not to use the HRH titles at all, ever, in any capacity.”While King Charles has reportedly opted for a softer approach, sources say Prince William is less forgiving. “He loathes and despises Harry and Meghan with every bone in his body,” the source claimed. “There is no way King William will stand for this. The titles will simply be removed when he is king. A way will be found.”The issue also reignites questions of royal precedent. In modern times, only three royals have lost their “HRH” styles: Princess Diana and Sarah Ferguson after divorcing royal spouses, and Prince Andrew after his scandal involving Jeffrey Epstein.Whether a future King William could legally strip Harry and Meghan of their HRH status remains uncertain. However, former UK minister Norman Baker told The Daily Beast that the HRH style is ultimately a gift of the monarch. “The law is not clear,” he said, “but I have little doubt that... the monarch could remove the HRH title. It would basically be the equivalent to an executive order in the US.”So far, Buckingham Palace, Kensington Palace, and reps for the Sussexes have not commented.","Prince William reportedly plans to strip Prince Harry and Meghan Markle of their ""HRH"" (His or Her Royal Highness) styles once he ascends to the throne.

The timing aligns with recent political changes, as Jens-Frederik Nielsen has assumed the role of prime minister in the Arctic territory.This delegation of private sector representatives is making their inaugural visit to the Arctic island following the election victory of Jens-Frederik Nielsen, who represents the business-friendly Demokratiit Party as the new premier.The delegation, led by Drew Horn—CEO of GreenMet and a former energy official under Trump—includes representatives from companies such as Critical Metals Corp, Cogency Power, American Renewable Metals, and Refacture.Backed by major institutional investors like Cerberus Capital Management and Cantor Fitzgerald, the group aims to boost US private sector presence in Greenland.""I'm not trying to do anything crazy like orchestrate a purchase or acquisition of Greenland by the United States,"" Horn told Reuters.""We're looking simply to do traditional private sector business development,"" he added, noting his consortium includes established investors like Cerberus Capital Management and Cantor Fitzgerald.The visit occurs shortly after Denmark's King Frederik's trip, symbolising the continued unity between Greenland and its former colonial power.

Kamala Harris accuses Trump of 'wholesale abandonment' of American ideals in major post-election speech,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-harris-accuses-trump-of-wholesale-abandonment-of-american-ideals-in-major-post-election-speech/articleshow/120782386.cms,"Kamala Harris (File Photo-AP)

SAN FRANCISCO: Former Vice President Kamala Harris used a high-profile speech Wednesday to sharply criticize President Donald Trump amid speculation about whether she will mount another presidential campaign or opt to run for California governor.Harris addressed the 20th anniversary gala for Emerge America , an organization that recruits and trains Democratic women to run for office that grew in part from Harris' run for San Francisco district attorney in the early 2000s.Her speech came the day after Trump reached 100 days in office. It is expected to be her most extensive public remarks since leaving office in January following her defeat to Trump, with planned critiques of the Republican president's handling of the economy, U.S. institutions and foreign policy.""Instead of an administration working to advance America's highest ideals, we are witnessing the wholesale abandonment of those ideals,"" Harris said.Before Wednesday, Harris had barely mentioned Trump by name since she conceded defeat to him in November, but she recently addressed the anxiety and confusion that have gripped many of her supporters since Trump took office.""Fear has a way of being contagious, and we are witnessing that, no doubt,"" she said at the Leading Women Defined Summit in early April, a forum for Black women leaders.""But courage is also contagious,"" she added, urging her audience to speak out against Trump. The current moment highlights ""the power of kindness, the power of sisterhood, the power of self care.""The speech was delivered below luminous chandeliers in a gold-trimmed ballroom in the landmark Palace Hotel in downtown.Trump went after Harris in a campaign-style rally Tuesday marking his 100th day in office. He sarcastically called her a ""great border czar"" and a ""great candidate,"" and repeated some of the applause lines he routinely delivered during the campaign.Until Harris replaced Joe Biden atop the Democratic ticket last summer, Trump said, ""I knew nothing about her.""Harris is ramping up her public presence as Democrats nationally search for a path forward after November's election, in which Republicans also won control of Congress. While a slate of high-profile Democrats - from governors to businessmen - seek leadership roles within the party, the former vice president retains unique influence and would reshape any future race she chooses to enter.Harris, a former state attorney general and US senator from California, has not discouraged speculation that she might enter the race to replace term-limited Gov. Gavin Newsom, himself a potential contender for president. And she has not ruled out another run for the White House.She continues to fundraise, using a joint committee that includes Harris for President, the Democratic National Committee and state Democratic parties. The committee, the Harris Victory Fund, reported having about $4.5 million on hand at the end of March, according to federal records.In recent fundraising emails, Harris has been blunt about the need for Democrats to unify ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.Democrats need to ""organize and stop Trump's agenda while electing Democrats everywhere,"" she wrote in recent emails. ""There has never been a more important time for a strong Democratic Party - one that is willing to stand up to Donald Trump, Elon Musk and what they are doing to this country.""The event marks a homecoming of sorts. Harris lives in Los Angeles but she is from the San Francisco Bay Area, where her political career is rooted. For her first major speech since the election, she chose familiar terrain and a friendly, in some ways familial, crowd.Lisa Gotbhi, a health care executive in San Francisco, said Harris' loss last year was a ""shock,"" but ""she's a voice we need and a leader we need. Let's get back in the fight.""",Kamala Harris addressed the 20th anniversary gala for Emerge America. It is expected to be her most extensive public remarks since leaving office in January.

On April 18, the US government launched an official Covid-19 website reiterating claims that the virus leaked from a lab in China. The site also criticized former President Joe Biden, Dr Anthony Fauci, and the World Health Organization for failing to hold China accountable.China’s white paper pushes back, citing a Missouri lawsuit that resulted in a symbolic $24 billion ruling against China, accusing Beijing of hoarding personal protective equipment and covering up the initial outbreak. The document calls the ruling politically motivated and legally flawed.“Substantial evidence suggested the Covid-19 might have emerged in the United States earlier than its officially-claimed timeline, and earlier than the outbreak in China,” the paper asserts, urging the international community to investigate early US cases.China said it had shared relevant information with the WHO and other countries in a timely and transparent manner. It highlighted the joint WHO-China study, which concluded that a lab leak was “extremely unlikely.”“The US should not continue to pretend to be deaf and dumb,” the white paper mentioned, urging Washington to address global concerns rather than deflect blame.Earlier this year, the CIA said it leaned slightly toward the lab-leak theory over natural origin but admitted having “low confidence” in its assessment. It maintained that both scenarios remained plausible.An official from China’s National Health Commission also told Xinhua that future origin-tracing efforts should now focus on the United States.With both sides digging in, the renewed exchange signals that the question of Covid-19’s origin remains a geopolitical flashpoint with no clear end in sight.","China accuses the United States of politicising the Covid-19 issue.

Immigrants detained at Bluebonnet detention centre in Anson, Texas, created an S-O-S signal visible from above this week.Thirty-one men arranged themselves to form the letters whilst a Reuters drone captured footage on Monday.Previously, numerous Venezuelan detainees received notices from immigration officials suggesting their involvement with the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, making them eligible for deportation under wartime legislation, as evidenced by documents, video calls and court records.Seven detainees' families spoke to Reuters, denying gang affiliations and confirming their relatives refused to sign the documents.On Friday, April 18, authorities attempted to transport them to Abilene Regional Airport, but the journey was interrupted and they returned to the facility.The Supreme Court subsequently issued a temporary halt to deportations, with the Department of Homeland Security offering no comment on the situation.The Venezuelans at Bluebonnet remain at risk of transfer to CECOT, El Salvador's high-security prison, where 137 Venezuelans were previously sent under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act.The privately-operated Bluebonnet facility, situated 200 miles west of Dallas, houses approximately 846 detainees daily in fiscal year 2025. Reuters captured aerial photographs after being denied direct access, revealing some detainees in red high-risk uniforms.Reuters identified several detainees, including Diover Millan, 24, and Jeferson Escalona, 19. Millan, transferred from Georgia's Stewart detention centre, lacks a criminal record despite officials claiming gang membership without evidence.Escalona, detained since January 2025, denies gang involvement, stating he served as a police officer in Venezuela. He believes authorities misinterpreted common Venezuelan hand gestures in photos on his confiscated phone.Despite requesting voluntary return to Venezuela, Escalona remains detained, expressing fears for his safety.Recent years have seen numerous Venezuelans seeking refuge in the United States, escaping economic hardship and alleged authoritarian measures under President Nicolas Maduro. The Trump administration aims to revoke temporary humanitarian protections established during Joe Biden's presidency.","Immigrants detained at Bluebonnet detention centre in Anson, Texas, created an S-O-S signal visible from above this week.

Authorities said the video caused renewed public fear.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120581257,imgsize-32640,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Vatican declares 167 victims of IS-inspired bombings in Sri Lanka witnesses of faith,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/vatican-declares-167-victims-of-is-inspired-bombings-in-sri-lanka-witnesses-of-faith/articleshow/120477883.cms,"Sri Lankan Catholics nuns carry portraits of the victims of the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks during its sixth anniversary commemoration in Colombo (Image: AP)

COLOMBO: Sri Lanka's catholic church says the Vatican has named 167 of its faithful killed in Islamic State-inspired suicide bombings six years ago as witnesses of faith.Hundreds, including Christian, Buddhist, Hindu and Islamic religious figures, attended a vigil Monday in memory of the victims at the church of St. Anthony, targeted in the attacks.Archbishop of Colombo, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, told the attendees Cardinal Marcello Semeraro, prefect of the Dicastery for the Causes of Saints in the Vatican, has included the names of 167 catholics who died in the bombings in the churches of St. Anthony in Colombo and St. Sebastian in Negombo ""in the catalogue of the witnesses of the faith in its order book, considering the context of their heroism.""He said they were chosen ""due to violent opposition to their faith motivated by 'odium fidei,' the hate of the faith."" Ranjith also said seven victims of other faiths were ""respectfully remembered.""Witnesses of faith are those who sacrificed their lives for their belief. Pope Francis formalized in 2023 a new category of recognition by the church of people who lost their lives while professing the catholic faith and created a special Vatican commission to catalogue their cases. The commission, based in the Vatican's saint-making office, has gathered hundreds of cases, with a view to highlighting them alongside officially recognized martyrs of the church, who are on the path to possible beatification or sainthood.More than 260 people, including 42 foreigners, were killed in the near-simultaneous bombings during Easter Sunday at three tourist hotels and three churches, two Catholic and one Protestant, on April 21, 2019.The catholic church in Sri Lanka has demanded further probing in the attacks, particularly after British television Channel 4 interviewed a man who said that he arranged a meeting between a local IS-inspired group, National Thowheed Jamath, and a top state intelligence official to hatch a plot to create insecurity in Sri Lanka and enable former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to win the presidential election later that year.","Sri Lanka's catholic church says the Vatican has named 167 of its faithful killed in Islamic State-inspired suicide bombings six years ago as witnesses of faith.

UK govt says ‘India has full support to go after perpetrators’ of Pahalgam terror attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-govt-says-india-has-full-support-to-go-after-perpetrators-of-pahalgam-terror-attack/articleshow/120742075.cms,"TOI correspondent from London

: The UK govt has said “India has our full support to go after the perpetrators of that attack (Pahalgam terror attack)” and that it is “seeking to play its full diplomatic role to help manage heightened tensions between India and Pakistan” as the tensions spill over onto the streets of Britain.But, foreign office minister Hamish Falconer said in the House of Commons on Tuesday, “It is important there is a proper law-enforcement-led response based on a focus of the actual perpetrators.”Britain said it was “vital that here in the UK all of us in positions of influence at a community level do what we can to ensure those tensions do not play out on British streets. A terrible terrorist attack has been perpetrated … We encourage Pakistanis to cooperate fully with the Indian govt in their efforts to investigate,” Falconer said. He was speaking during a debate on the Pahalgam attack, which left 26 people dead, following an urgent question by Labour MP Gurinder Singh Josan.“The two states are talking to each other, which is welcome. It is understandable the concerns India has for its security in light of such a horrific incident and it is clearly taking steps to try to establish the facts of the incident as best it can and will have British support to do so,” Falconer said.Falconer refrained from commenting on what UK security agencies know as to who is behind the attacks. He said both the Pakistan and India high commissions “will receive all support from the UK state to ensure they remain safe.”A J&K-born man, Ankit Love (41), was charged with criminal damage after allegedly smashing windows at the Pakistan high commission on Sunday. He appeared in court on Monday. He was blacklisted by the Indian govt after being charged with criminal damage for throwing eggs and stones at the India high commission in Feb 2022.Falconer toldMPs he was aware of the throat-slitting gesture video of a Pakistan diplomat. “The Metropolitan police are investigating, so I will not provide any further commentary on that particular incident, but it is obviously concerning,” Falconer said.Several MPs expressed their horror at how Hindus and Christians were targeted in the attack. Others criticised India for suspending the Indus water treaty or making “unfounded claims” against Pakistan or resorting to ""bulldozer tactics"".Labour MP Barry Gardiner asked: “Is it not time to make the support we give to Pakistan conditional on them finally closing down the terrorist training camps that they harbour?”“Until the investigation is concluded, we should not speculate on the nature of the attack. As we understand it, international agreements have been put in abeyance, rather than being rescinded,” Falconer said.","India has our full support to go after the perpetrators of that attack (Pahalgam terror attack), UK govt says.
