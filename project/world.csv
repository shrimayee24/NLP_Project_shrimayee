When will the PM speak up?"" the grand old party's national spokesperson said in a post on X on Saturday.This came after Trump said that Pakistan and US were set to discuss trade in next week noting that he ""wouldn't have any interest in making a deal with either if they were going to be at war with each other.""""I think the deal I'm most proud of is the fact that we're dealing with India, we're dealing with Pakistan, and we were able to stop potentially a nuclear war through trade as opposed through bullets. You know, normally they do it through bullets. We do it through trade. So I'm very proud of that. Nobody talks about it. But we had a very nasty potential war going on between Pakistan and India. And now, if you look, they're doing fine,"" he said.In a series of posts noting the number of times Trump took credit for the truce, which is at least thrice in the past 24 hours, Ramesh said, ""Donaldbhai keeps repeating the same sequence of events of how he got the 4-Day India-Pakistan war to stop - US intervention and the use of the trade instrument to stop nuclear escalation.""""The equivalence of India and Pakistan gets reiterated yet again. President Trump's Commerce Secretary has made exactly the same claims in his submission to the New York-based Court of International Trade on May 23rd.

Is President Trump also doing what Mr. Modi does all the time and so well (i.e. lying)? Or is he speaking even 50% truth?"" he added.While Trump's recent claims have not drawn a categorical denial from New Delhi, the ministry of external affairs has consistently maintained that the India-Pakistan ceasefire was a bilateral decision, and there have been no trade discussions with the United States related to or following Operation Sindoor.","Congress leader Jairam Ramesh stepped up his attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi demanding answers on US President Donald Trump's continuous claims that he used trade as a war deterrent.

NEW DELHI: An email threat received by secretary, ministry of heavy industries warning of the use of “suicide IEDs” in Udyog Bhavan, prompted an alert on Friday afternoon, though a search mounted by the Delhi Police and CISF eventually found it to be a hoax.Udyog Bhawan is located in a high-security area of the Capital that houses Rashtrapati Bhavan, Parliament House and key Central government offices.An email dated 30.05.2025 was delivered to secretary, heavy industries, with a threatening message about the use of suicide IEDs on Udyog Bhawan premises and asking that they the building be evacuated by 3.15 pm. This prompted the ministry of heavy industries to inform the Delhi Police, which rushed its personnel and bomb disposal squad there. Sources told TOI that CISF, which secures Udyog Bhavan, was not simultaneously informed about the email and possibly learned of it when the Delhi Police arrived there.CISF eventually also received a formal letter from the ministry of heavy industries, with the threat email attached. A look at the email prima facie led the CISF to view it as part of the pattern of similar email threats received over the past couple of months warning of bomb attacks in different high-value buildings across the country, but which were later found to be a hoax.These email threats, suspected to be originating from the same IP address outside the country, have a common link – the mention of the “unjust arrest” of Tamil YouTuber Savukku Shankar, though the sender is careful to also bring in the “unjust hanging” of Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru and “custodial death” of 2G accused Shahid Balwa.Anyway, not wanting to leave anything to chance, CISF along with Delhi Police conducted a thorough search of the Udyog Bhawan premises, even though no evacuation was carried out to avoid panic among the people. After floor-by-floor search of the area, the CISF declared the premises to be safe and ruled out the presence of any IED.Similar email threats were received earlier, warning of bomb threats at the Mapusa deputy collector’s office in Goa on April 3, the Jaipur collectorate on April 4, the Taj Palace Hotel and Chhatrapati Shivaji airport terminal in Mumbai on May 17 and the Punjab and Haryana High Court premises on May 22. All were found to be a hoax.","An email threat received by secretary, ministry of heavy industries warning of the use of ‘suicide IEDs’ in Udyog Bhavan prompted an alert on Friday afternoon.

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party MP Ravi Shankar Prasad on Friday slammed Pakistani nationals who demonstrated against India outside a venue in Copenhagen hosting an Indian parliamentary delegation and said that Pakistan is a desperate country, and they protest out of desperation.Addressing the Indian diaspora in Copenhagen, the BJP MP said that the Pakistanis who are protesting here are doing so because their ""handlers"" have told them to do so.""We have come here carrying hopes and aspirations of the people — the blessings, emotions, compassion, 1.4 billions Indians, we have come. I was very surprised to see the great Pakistanis shouting slogans there. When ambassador called me and asked, 'What's going on?' — we had gone to France, we had gone to Rome, we were here yesterday, and today too,"" the BJP MP, one of the leaders of 7 all party delegation who are going around the world to give details about Operation Sindoor, said.""The program is going very well — whether in France, Rome or Copenhagen — we are getting wide coverage in the local media, international media, on the radio, television, and social media. Then their handlers in Pakistan must have told them, ""What are you doing? Do something!"" So out of desperation, they came here. Pakistan is a desperate country — it acts out of desperation, and continues to ignore things with impunity.That is the whole point,"" he added.The visiting Indian delegation comprises BJP MPs Ravi Shankar Prasad and Daggubati Purandeswari, Samik Bhattacharya, Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi, Congress MPs Ghulam Ali Khatana and Amar Singh, former Union Minister MJ Akbar, and Ambassador Pankaj Saran.Samik Bhattacharya emphasised their mission to alert the world about terrorism , noting that Pakistani businesses abroad often operate under Indian names.Former minister MJ Akbar described Pakistan as having a ""double face"" and praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership in addressing Pakistan's behaviour.Priyanka Chaturvedi emphasised cross-party unity against Pakistan, referencing Shiv Sena's historical stance. She also questioned the IMF's decision to provide loans to Pakistan, suggesting the funds were being misused for anti-India activities.""As we were coming here, we saw some flags, and you all would know what those flags are. And I thought to myself, the IMF loan is coming in handy, and I hope those who are giving them the IMF loan realise what it's being used for. So, just two minutes ago, I walked outside to check if they'd left, and I was told they'd gone. And while we Indians continue to be resolutely strong in our backing for mother India,"" Chaturvedi said.","Bharatiya Janata Party MP Ravi Shankar Prasad slammed Pakistani nationals who demonstrated against India outside a venue in Copenhagen.

NEW DELHI: After the Shashi Tharoor-led delegation to the US expressed disagreement over Colombia 's statement supporting Pakistan , the state withdrew its statement and ""will issue a statement of strong support for our position and understanding of our position,"" the Congress MP said.""We met with the foreign ministry - the senior vice minister received us.

Finally, here we are before this beautiful bust of Mahatma Gandhi on the campus of the main university,"" Tharoor said.Speaking to the reporters later, he said, ""There is no equivalence between those who attack our country and those who defend their own country, and our only disappointment with the earlier statement by Colombia was that it seemed to have overlooked this difference. We're very pleased to learn that that statement has been withdrawn as you've also mentioned, and we are also very pleased that you, as representatives of the people of Colombia, are determined to stand with us for our sovereignty, for peace in the world, for peace in the subcontinent of India and that you are very, very happy that this kind of dialogue will continue between our peoples and our representatives. ""Taranjit Singh Sandhu, former Indian ambassador to the United States and senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader, said that the delegation's comprehensive briefing was instrumental in prompting Colombia to reverse its stance.""This morning we had a detailed interaction with the acting Foreign Minister and our leader and the entire team made specific points to them explaining to them the timeline which perhaps to an extent they might have missed out. The end result was that they are withdrawing one of the other statements which had come out and have promised and stated, actually quite clearly, on terrorism and the issue. The importance of Colombia, apart from other reasons, is also that it will be a member of the Security Council soon,"" he said.Noting that Colombia understood India's position as it was once plagued by terrorism, BJP MP Shashank Mani said, ""It is notable that terrorism has affected Colombia as well. However, after a long struggle, Colombia is now a peaceful country. We have come here with a message of peace. We have clearly stated that we will give a fitting response to every terrorist attack, and when it is over, we want nothing but peace.""Tharoor voiced disappointment during a press conference in Bogotá on Thursday over Colombia’s stance. He noted that India was disheartened by the Colombian government’s decision to offer condolences for the casualties in Pakistan during Operation Sindoor, instead of expressing solidarity with the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack.""We were a little disappointed in the reaction of the Colombian government, which apparently expressed heartfelt condolences on the loss of lives in Pakistan after the Indian strikes, rather than sympathising with the victims of terrorism,"" said Tharoor.""We will say to our friends in Colombia, there can be no equivalence between those who dispatch terrorists and those who resist them. There can be no equivalence between those who attack and those who defend. We are only exercising our right of self-defence, and if there is any misunderstanding here, on this core, we are here to dispel any such misunderstanding"", he added.Tharoor is heading the multi-party delegation on a tour across the Americas as part of India’s global outreach to emphasize its zero-tolerance policy towards terrorism.

"'She wanted to escape': How 100 witnesses, exhaustive evidence exposed VIP cover-up, led to justice in Rishikesh resort murder case",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/she-wanted-to-escape-how-100-witnesses-exhaustive-evidence-exposed-vip-cover-up-led-to-justice-in-rishikesh-resort-murder-case/articleshow/121520903.cms,"NEW DELHI: The verdict arrived like a long-awaited storm in Kotdwar’s courtroom, quiet but crushing. More than two years and eight months after a 19-year-old receptionist was murdered in cold blood, the gavel finally fell. Resort owner Pulkit Arya, along with Saurabh Bhaskar and Ankit Gupta, was sentenced to life imprisonment.For those who had followed the case, one that had stunned Uttarakhand and the nation, it was a grim vindication. The verdict, delivered by the additional district and sessions judge, came after a painstaking trial involving around 100 witnesses of which 47 were produced in court with their testimonies stretching over nearly three years.The charges were as damning as the headlines that once blazed across national media. The trio stood convicted under multiple sections of murder, destruction of evidence, criminal conspiracy, and sexual harassment. The court also found them guilty under the Immoral Traffic Prevention Act, lending judicial weight to early suspicions that the Vanantra Resort in Rishikesh, where the victim worked, was a front for something far darker.One witness didn’t mince words, calling the resort “a den of vice.”The girl had only been 19, employed at a property owned by Pulkit Arya, son of a now-expelled BJP leader. In the weeks before her death, she had reached out to those she trusted. A former colleague and a close friend both later revealed she had confided in them - terrified, desperate, and deeply uneasy. She told them she was being pushed to provide “special services” to an incoming VIP guest.“She wanted to escape from there,” said an officer from the Special Investigation Team (SIT), which later took over the probe.But she never got the chance. On September 18, 2022, she was killed for refusing those demands. Her body surfaced six days later, dumped in the Chilla canal. The crime, horrifying in its brutality and made more incendiary by the accused’s political connections, lit a fuse of public outrage. Protests broke out across the state. A high-level investigation was ordered.At the centre of it all was the SIT, led by DIG P Renuka Devi. Their investigation produced a 500-page chargesheet. The evidence was exhaustive: about 100 witness statements and 30 pieces of documentary proof. Yet, it was two voices that ultimately helped crack the case wide open - the victim’s confidantes. Her friend and the ex-employee both confirmed what she had feared: the resort was not what it seemed, and she was desperate to leave.Initially, much of what was known came from WhatsApp chats with her friend, some of which were later leaked online. But investigators discovered she had also spoken to the former employee, warning them about the illegal activities at the resort and her fear of being forced to serve a powerful, unnamed VIP.Senior officers later confirmed that narco-tests were requested for the accused in hopes of identifying this shadowy figure. His name, even today, remains unknown.When the day of the verdict arrived, Pauri Garhwal’s courtroom was transformed. Security was tight. Officers from nearby districts were brought in. The area around the courthouse was designated a “zero zone” - a perimeter of 100 metres where only government staff and approved attendees were allowed entry.Outside, emotions overflowed. Soni Devi, the victim’s mother, broke down as she addressed the media. “May the criminals be sentenced to death,” she told ANI. Her words rang heavy with grief and fury, echoing the pain that first gripped Uttarakhand back in 2022 and the demand for justice that never wavered.","Pulkit Arya, Saurabh Bhaskar and Ankit Gupta sentenced to life in prison.

Salman Khurshid praises Article 370 move; BJP questions if Congress will 'turn on him' like Tharoor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/salman-khurshid-praises-article-370-move-bjp-questions-if-congress-will-turn-on-him-like-tharoor/articleshow/121519903.cms,"NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Friday questioned whether the Congress would now target senior leader Salman Khurshid for what it called “speaking an inconvenient truth” after party leader Shashi Tharoor faced backlash from within the grand-old party for supporting the Centre over Operation Sindoor stance.BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya, in a post on X, pointed to Khurshid’s remarks during the ongoing multi-party MPs delegation tour, saying they signaled cross-party support for the government's actions in Jammu & Kashmir and a firm stand on India’s sovereignty.""Mr Khurshid’s stance reflects bipartisan support for the Centre’s actions in Jammu & Kashmir, underscoring a broader sense of national unity against cross-border terrorism and a strong reaffirmation of India’s territorial integrity,"" Malviya said.""Will the Congress now turn on him for speaking an inconvenient truth, just as they did with Shashi Tharoor? Or is Tharoor being punished simply for daring to challenge the Gandhi camp’s chosen candidate for Congress President?"" he asked.Former external affairs minister Khurshid, who is in one of the 7 all-party delegations to expose Pakistan post Pahalgam terror attack, said that prosperity and normalcy have returned to Jammu and Kashmir after abrogation of Article 370.""Kashmir had a major problem for a long time. Much of that was reflected in the thinking of the government in an article called Article 370 of the Constitution, which somehow gave the impression that it was separate from the rest of the country. But Article 370 was abrogated and it was finally put to an end,"" Khurshid said while addressing the Indonesian think tanks and academia.""Subsequently, there was an election with 65% participation in the election. There's an elected government in Kashmir today, and therefore, for people who want to undo everything that has happened, the prosperity that has come to Kashmir,"" he added.This comes after Tharoor faced criticism from party colleagues over his recent remarks on surgical strikes.Tharoor, currently leading a multi-party delegation to countries including Panama and the US, had said that India conducted its first cross-border surgical strike in 2016, a claim seen by many in the party as undermining similar operations during the UPA era.Facing flak from Congress leaders such as Pawan Khera and Udit Raj, Tharoor defended himself in a strongly worded post on X from Panama City, clarifying that his remarks specifically referred to responses to terrorist attacks, not to prior wars or conflicts.""After a long and successful day in Panama, I have to wind up at midnight here with departure for Bogota, Colombia in six hours, so I don’t really have time for this — but anyway: For those zealots fulminating about my supposed ignorance of Indian valour across the LoC: in the past,"" Tharoor said in a post on X.""I was clearly and explicitly speaking only about reprisals for terrorist attacks and not about previous wars and my remarks were preceded by a reference to the several attacks that have taken place in recent years alone, during which previous Indian responses were both restrained and constrained by our responsible respect for the LoC and the IB,"" he added.Tharoor's ""India breached the LoC for the first time during the 2016 surgical strike"" remark prompted a sharp response from his party colleague Udit Raj, who accused Tharoor of denigrating Congress's legacy. ""How could you denigrate the golden history of Congress by saying that before PM Modi, India never crossed the LoC and the International border?"" Raj questioned.He went so far as to suggest Tharoor be made a ""super spokesperson of the BJP.""Pawan Khera also weighed in, posting a screenshot from Tharoor’s book, where the MP had previously criticised the Modi government for politicising the 2016 strikes while acknowledging that the Congress had authorised several such operations in the past without publicising them.","BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya, in a post on X, pointed to Khurshid’s remarks during the ongoing multi-party MPs delegation tour.

Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate responded by saying the BJP had only disowned the sindoor campaign after facing backlash.The West Bengal CM's remarks had followed PM Modi’s rally in Alipurduar where he launched a fierce attack on the TMC government, alleging that it had failed on multiple fronts including women’s safety, youth employment, and corruption.

He attributed this to information BSF had discreetly gathered through keen observation of Pakistani border posts during peacetime.“Pakistan has suffered the biggest blow to its communication systems and surveillance equipment.This proves that even during peacetime, you (BSF) kept a vigilant eye... Based on your accurate intelligence, a precise counter-strategy was prepared well in advance. When the opportunity arose, you implemented it with success,” Shah said amid cheers from the jawans.Lauding BSF personnel deployed in Jammu, Rajouri and Kutch for “guarding the border with utmost alertness, dedication and valour”, Shah said he was among them to convey the gratitude of the country’s 140 crore citizens. “When the enemy commits any type of aggression on the international border, BSF, being the first line of defence, is the first to take it on its chin,” Shah said.The home minister was accompanied by J&K lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha, Union home secretary Govind Mohan and other top officials. “In any situation -- be it snow-clad areas, desert, deep forests, swamps or mountains, for 365 days a year and 24 hours a day, BSF personnel remain in position, vigilant, and dedicated. No attack can cause much damage within the hinterland, as the first line of defence is always the chest of a BSF soldier,” Shah said.Shah also addressed a gathering in Poonch town after distributing appointment letters to family members of those killed in recent Pakistani shelling. At least 13 civilians, including three minors, died in Poonch alone. The govt will soon unveil a separate package for shelling-affected families, Shah said, adding 90,000 bunkers have been built along LoC and more will be set up to protect civilians.“I admire the courage of the people of Poonch and its administration for the way they responded to Pakistani shelling,” Shah said. The minister contrasted the Pakistani shelling on civilian areas in J&K, including religious sites, with India’s precise and targeted strikes on terror hubs in Pakistan when Operation Sindoor was launched on May 7.Referring to last month’s Pahalgam attack, Shah lauded the J&K people’s unity against terror. “India under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi has sent a clear message that any attack on civilians will not be tolerated and will be responded to more effectively and with accuracy. Terror and trade cannot go together. Blood and water cannot flow together. This is our policy and we will fight every terrorist activity on our soil,” Shah said.Chairing a security review meeting in Jammu late Thursday in the presence of LG Sinha, Shah reaffirmed enhanced security for the 38-day-long Amarnath Yatra. Union home secretary Mohan, Army chief Gen Upendra Dwivedi, J&K chief secretary Atal Dulloo and J&K DGP Nalin Prabhat were among top officials who attended the meeting.“Evaluated security arrangements and preparedness meant for the pilgrims. Instructed to ensure utmost vigilance and ensure seamless completion of the sacred journey,” Shah posted on X.","BSF dismantled 118 Pakistani forward posts and surveillance networks along the Jammu frontier, Union home minister Amit Shah said Friday.

GUWAHATI: Assam's BJP-led government has accelerated the process of tracking down individuals declared illegal foreigners by Foreigners' Tribunals and is pushing them back into the no-man's land between India and Bangladesh.At least 49 such ""declared foreign nationals"" were pushed back from western and southern Assam on May 27 and 29, after which at least three petitioners have separately moved the Supreme Court and Gauhati HC seeking the whereabouts of their family members, suspected to have been pushed back, and a halt to the ongoing drive.Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Friday that ""30,000 people, after being declared foreign nationals by various tribunals over the years, have disappeared. We have decided to speed up the process of detecting them, which was paused when the NRC was being updated.The moment we get them, we have to take action and we are working as per law"".Sarma said that in coming days there would be a lot of push-backs, and added that a declared foreigner could appeal in HC or SC. ""If one has not preferred an appeal in the higher court, his right to stay in India is forfeited. But if a declared foreigner can show that he has made an appeal, we are not disturbing him,"" he said.""If judiciary has given a stay (on the tribunal order declaring them foreigners), we are respecting the judiciary and we have allowed such people to stay,"" Sarma said.Sarma said that there were two types of illegals - people who have just come in and those who have been declared foreigners by tribunals.""The SC ordered (in Feb) that those declared foreigners and have not made any appeal should be sent back by any means. Only yesterday 35 Bangladeshis who came in a few days ago were detected near the border with Meghalaya, in Silchar, and were immediate pushed back,"" he said.On Thursday, Gauhati HC issued notice to the state government directing it to provide details of the whereabouts of two brothers who were declared foreigners by a tribunal and subsequently released on conditional bail. One Torap Ali, nephew of Abu Bakkar Siddik and Akbar Ali, claimed in his petition that his family apprehends both his uncles ""may be in danger of being illegally pushed into Bangladesh"".The two were declared foreigners by a tribunal in 2017 and sent to a transit camp in Goalpara. They were released on bail in 2020 following an SC directive that those in detention for over two years may be released on bail. They were detained by police on May 24, the petitioner submitted, and claimed that the authorities have refused to give details of their whereabouts. The court has fixed the next hearing for June 4.Similarly, SC said on Friday it would hear on Monday a habeas corpus petition filed by a 26-year-old man stating that his mother, Monowara Bewa of Dhubri, also a declared foreigner, was detained by police on May 24 and since then her whereabouts were unknown.","Assam's BJP-led government has accelerated the process of tracking down individuals declared illegal foreigners.

BENGALURU: Congress in Karnataka is heading into a critical phase as internal tensions between CM Siddaramaiah and deputy, DK Shivakumar , escalate, raising concerns about the stability of the govt and the party's long-term prospects, reports Manu Aiyappa Kanathanda.At the heart of the conflict is the unresolved issue of a change of guard. An unwritten understanding is believed to have been reached when Congress formed the government in May 2023 - that Siddaramaiah would serve as CM for two-and-a-half years, after which Shivakumar would take over. If honoured, this transition would take place in Nov.However, with no official word from party high command and no signs of preparation for a handover, the issue is becoming increasingly contentious. Both netas remain indispensable to Congress in Karnataka - Siddaramaiah with his Ahinda (backward classes, minorities and Dalits) clout and administrative experience, and Shivakumar with his fundraising abilities and control over the organisation. Buoyed by loyal support, Siddaramaiah is showing no signs of stepping aside. Instead, he is consolidating his position and intends to serve a full term, sources say.This has left Shivakumar's camp testy. The latest face-off was the transfer of engineers from the water resources department which he oversees. Shivakumar's decision to record his displeasure in writing marks a significant shift. Sources say the move signals a deliberate attempt to assert his position.""The fact that he put it in writing is a message to the party,"" said a senior Congress functionary. ""He's not going to remain passive as the CM strengthens his grip.""It is said Shivakumar views the reassignments as an effort to weaken his administrative authority. The timing of the rift, too, is significant. ""Siddaramaiah believes these developments are part of a larger plan to push him out. His focus now is to prove that his leadership remains strong and that he can withstand political and personal attacks,"" said an MLA from Bengaluru.","Internal tensions between CM Siddaramaiah and deputy, DK Shivakumar, escalate.

NEW DELHI: Former external affairs minister Salman Khurshid on Friday showed his displeasure over opposition's remarks on MPs supporting the Centre with his statements on Operation Sindoor While interacting with the Indian community in Indonesia's Jakarta, Khurshid said that all-party MP delegations are not supporting each other's parties but a ""simple idea called India. """"India is waiting to be great. Nobody can distract us or interfere with that passage of ours. That is why it is important for us to show our strength. If there is any sense in Pakistan, they will understand our only demand: give up terrorism,"" the Congress leader said.""Some of my colleagues are not from the ruling party. The ruling party could have come alone to bring this message, but they came with us to give India's message... However, sadly, this is not what we hear from India. Somebody is saying that he is supporting the BJP or the Congress, but I am proud that we are here together because we are not supporting , we are supporting one simple idea called India,"" he added.This comes after Shahshi Tharoor and Khurshid found themselves in crosshairs with Congress for their remarks during the trip.Earlier in the day, Khurshid, who is in one of the 7 all-party delegations to expose Pakistan post Pahalgam terror attack, said that prosperity and normalcy have returned to Jammu and Kashmir after the abrogation of Article 370 ""Kashmir had a major problem for a long time. Much of that was reflected in the thinking of the government in an article called 370 of the Constitution, which somehow gave an impression that it was separate from the rest of the country. But Article 370 was abrogated and it was finally put to an end,"" Khurshid said while addressing the Indonesian think Tanks and Academia""Subsequently, there was an election with 65% participation.There's an elected government in Kashmir today and therefore for people to want to undo everything that has happened, the prosperity that has come to Kashmir,"" he added.Earlier, Tharoor, currently leading a multi-party delegation to countries including Panama and the US, had said that India conducted its first cross-border surgical strike in 2016, a claim seen by many in the party as undermining similar operations during the UPA era.Facing flak from Congress leaders such as Pawan Khera and Udit Raj, Tharoor defended himself in a strongly worded post on X from Panama City, clarifying that his remarks specifically referred to responses to terrorist attacks—not to prior wars or conflicts.""After a long and successful day in Panama, I have to wind up at midnight here with departure for Bogota, Colombia in six hours, so I don’t really have time for this — but anyway: For those zealots fulminating about my supposed ignorance of Indian valour across the LoC: in the past,"" Tharoor said in a post on X.""I was clearly and explicitly speaking only about reprisals for terrorist attacks and not about previous wars and my remarks were preceded by a reference to the several attacks that have taken place in recent years alone, during which previous Indian responses were both restrained and constrained by our responsible respect for the LoC and the IB,"" he added.The controversy erupted after Tharoor reportedly stated in Panama that India breached the LoC ""for the first time"" during the 2016 surgical strike. This prompted a sharp response from his party colleague Udit Raj, who accused Tharoor of denigrating Congress's legacy. ""How could you denigrate the golden history of Congress by saying that before PM Modi, India never crossed LoC and International border?"" Raj questioned.He went so far as to suggest Tharoor be made a ""super spokesperson of the BJP.""Pawan Khera also weighed in, posting a screenshot from Tharoor’s book, where the MP had previously criticised the Modi government for politicising the 2016 strikes while acknowledging that the Congress had authorised several such operations in the past without publicising them.","Khurshid said that all-party MP delegations are not supporting each other's parties but a ""simple idea called India"" The former external affairs minister said that prosperity and normalcy have returned to Jammu and Kashmir after the abrogation of Article 370.

'Backstabbed from within'

Letter bomb revealed rift

HYDERABAD: In an escalation of intra-party squabbling in Telangana, Bharat Rashtra Samithi MLC and former MP Kalvakuntla Kavitha, daughter of party supremo K Chandrasekhar Rao, Thursday accused senior netas within her own party of attempting to merge BRS with BJP - a move she says she vehemently opposed even while incarcerated in the Delhi liquor policy scam case last year.Interacting with media at her residence, Kavitha tore into the party leadership, indirectly targeting working president and her brother KT Rama Rao for failing to act against 'internal coverts,' not responding to attacks from Congress, and remaining silent during a coordinated smear campaign against her.""When I was in jail, there was talk of merging BRS with BJP. I told my father, let party remain independent, even if it meant I stayed in jail for another year,"" Kavitha said. She added her actions were aimed only at strengthening the party, and backstabbing was not in her DNA.Kavitha said there was an internal conspiracy to sideline her and sever her connection with KCR. Referring to the leak of a private letter she had written to her father earlier this month, she accused party insiders of attempting to discredit her and questioned why the leadership failed to act against those responsible.""Instead of finding those who leaked the letter, they unleashed paid social media trolls and media artistes, even from abroad, to malign me,"" she quipped.The succession war within BRS - between KTR and Kavitha - has come at a time when BRS is celebrating its silver jubilee and at the same time grappling with multiple issues, including fighting a legal battle over defections by its MLAs who have joined Congress.Analysts say succession battles typically arise after the supremo is no longer in picture. However, in BRS's case, power tussle has begun while KCR is still at the helm. Sources said KCR's relatives within BRS have already split into camps, supporting either KTR or Kavitha.The rift between the duo became apparent after Kavitha wrote a 'feedback letter' to KCR regarding his speech at the BRS silver jubilee meeting in Warangal. In the letter, she expressed dissatisfaction, particularly regarding KCR in his speech not targeting the BJP, not addressing the issue of BC reservations, lack of accessibility to BRS leaders, and other concerns. Party sources said differences emerged more than a year ago and intensified in the past few months.","Kalvakuntla Kavitha, daughter of party supremo K Chandrasekhar Rao, accused senior netas within her own party of attempting to merge BRS with BJP.

BENGALURU: Karnataka's Congress government is considering sending to the President a bill that proposes reservation for Muslims in civil contracts after governor Thaawar Chand Gehlot returned it a second time, insisting it be forwarded to President Droupadi Murmu.Karnataka Transparency in Public Procurement (Amendment) Bill, 2025, provides for 4% reservation to Muslims in civil contracts up to Rs 1 crore, besides quotas for SCs, STs and OBCs (Category I and II-A) in government tenders for goods and services. It was passed by the state legislature in March. Law and parliamentary affairs minister HK Patil had planned to meet senior officials and legal experts Thursday to decide the next course of action, but that meeting was postponed.Senior officials said the government had considered challenging Gehlot's decision in court. However, constitutional experts reportedly advised against legal action, urging the government to pursue alternative routes instead. The issue is likely to be informally discussed during a meeting that CM Siddaramaiah is scheduled to chair on Friday.Gehlot had referred the bill to the President previously following objections from the BJP.The principal opposition party argued that providing reservations based on religion violates constitutional provisions and urged the governor to withhold assent.The government then re-sent the bill to Raj Bhavan without amendment but included detailed explanations justifying its stance and requesting the governor's approval. Gehlot, however, remained firm and sent it back again, reiterating reference to the President.","Karnataka Transparency in Public Procurement (Amendment) Bill, 2025, provides for 4% reservation to Muslims in civil contracts up to Rs 1 crore.

Viral: MIT Grad Wears Arab Headscarf; Torches Alma Mater’s Israel Ties In Viral Speech |Megha Vemuri





At a politically charged commencement ceremony on Thursday, MIT ’s class of 2025 president Megha Vemuri, an Indian-American student, used her platform to deliver a bold pro-Palestinian message, sharply criticising the university’s ties to Israel and calling on fellow graduates to take a stand.Wearing a red keffiyeh, a symbol of Palestinian solidarity, Vemuri addressed a crowd of graduates, families, and faculty, saying, “You showed the world that MIT wants a free Palestine.”Her remarks came amid ongoing nationwide campus unrest over the war in Gaza and US university connections to defence and research institutions tied to the conflict. In her speech, Vemuri acknowledged the uncertainty gripping academia and the intense pressures faced by student activists.“It is no secret that at this time, academic institutions across the country are shrouded in a dark cloud of uncertainty,” she said. “There is a lot of fear in many of our hearts.”Vemuri pointed to MIT’s research links with the Israeli military as a source of shame and moral conflict for the institution. “The Israeli occupation forces are the only foreign military that MIT has research ties with,” she said. “This means that Israel’s assault on the Palestinian people is not only aided and abetted by our country, but our school.”She noted that both MIT’s undergraduate body and its graduate student union had, in recent months, voted “overwhelmingly to cut ties with the genocidal Israeli military.”“You faced threats, intimidation and suppression coming from all directions, especially your own university officials, but you prevailed,” she told graduates. “Because the MIT community that I know would never tolerate a genocide.”Referring to the destruction of higher education infrastructure in Gaza, Vemuri added: “There are no universities left in Gaza. We are watching Israel try to wipe Palestine off the face of the earth, and it is a shame that MIT is a part of it.”The student leader concluded her address with a symbolic gesture, asking graduates to turn their MIT class rings so that the emblem faced outward—a tradition that symbolises their move into the wider world. But her message was pointed.“We carry with us the obligation to do everything we can to stop it,” she said. “MIT is directly complicit in the ongoing genocide of the Palestinian people.”",Indian-American student Megha Vemuri delivered a bold pro-Palestinian message.

Several officials from the US government have received messages from someone who is impersonatingSusie Wiles, President Donald Trump's chief of staff.Trump said that Wiles is an amazing woman and that she can handle this. The US authorities have started the investigation.“They breached the phone; they tried to impersonate her,” Trump told reporters on Friday. “Nobody can impersonate her. There's only one Susie.”Susie Wiles has previously served as the co-manager of Trump’s campaign before taking on the role of chief of staff in the new administration.As reported by the Wall Street Journal, governors, business officials, and senators began to receive text messages and phone calls as the impersonator had gained access to their contact details through Wiles’s phone.However, the texts and calls were not going through Wiles’s number. The voice sounded like Wiles’s and might have been generated by artificial Intelligence, suggest people who have received the phone calls.Some thought that the text messages were coming from White House officials. But it is still quite nebulous as to how someone got access to Wiles’s phone.Earlier this month, the FBI had warned in a public service announcement of a malicious campaign in which unidentified “malicious actors” have been calling and sending text messages impersonating senior government officials.This campaign mainly depends on Artificial Intelligence, aiming to dupe government officials, as per the FBI.FBI director Kash Patel commented, “Safeguarding our administration officials' ability to securely communicate to accomplish the president's mission is a top priority.”Last year, Iran had also gained access to Trump’s campaign, sensitive internal documents, including a dossier on vice president JD Vance.","Several officials from the US government have received messages from someone who is impersonatingSusie Wiles, President Donald Trump's chief of staff.

DJ Daniel, the Texas cancer-survivor teen who was sworn in as an honorary secret service agent by US president Donald Trump, is now facing three new tumours.DJ was first diagnosed in 2018 and given only five months to live. To honour his lifelong dream, he was sworn in as an honorary secret service member during Donald Trump’s address to Congress on March 4.Speaking to Fox 7 Austin, DJ’s father admitted the emotional toll has been heavy. “It’s rough, there isn’t a class that can teach you how to deal with it. You’re hearing that your child has a nasty disease,” he said. But he also said that DJ’s journey is about more than just illness — it’s about spreading kindness and unity.White House also posted on X, sharing the news.

By the time he was 9 years old, he had developed a deep respect for law enforcement and decided he wanted to follow a similar path, dreaming of one day wearing the uniform himself.Despite his condition, DJ remains upbeat.

US President Donald Trump offered marital advice to French President Emmanuel Macron after a video of him, apparently, being shoved by his wife Brigitte went viral earlier this week.""Make sure the door remains closed.

In a video shot by the Associated Press in Hanoi, Macron was seen emerging from his plane as he landed. His wife Birgitte's arm then emerged from the left of the door.

United States defence secretary Pete Hegseth warned on Saturday that China was preparing to use force to increase its dominance in the Indo-Pacific region.Speaking at the annual security forum, Shangri-La Dialogue, in Singapore, Hegseth said that Beijing was ""credibly preparing to potentially use military force to alter the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific"".""The threat China poses is real and it could be imminent,"" Hegseth said, adding that Beijing ""hopes to dominate and control"" Asia.Hegseth further warned about China's potential invasion of Taiwan, for which he said the Chinese forces were building capability, training every day, and ""rehearsing for the real deal"". China also has a stated goal of taking over Taiwan by force if necessary by 2027.He also raised concerns about China’s growing presence in Latin America, especially its efforts to expand influence over the Panama Canal.The Pentagon chief urged the US allies, particularly partners in Asia, to step up defence spending owing to the threat posed by Beijing.Citing pledges by Nato members including Germany to move toward US president Donald Trump's spending target of five percent of GDP, Hegseth said, "" ""It's hard to believe a little bit... that I'm saying this, but thanks to president Trump, Asian allies should look to countries in Europe for a newfound example.""""Deterrence doesn't come on the cheap,"" he added.The Pentagon chief said that the US stood by its allies and had stepped up cooperation with Japan and the Philippines, and a deep partnership with India.Hegseth also warned that countries trying to balance between US military support and Chinese economic investments are taking a significant gamble. “Beware of the leverage the Chinese Communist Party aims to gain through such entanglements,” he said.China typically sends its defence minister to this annual security conference.

SINGAPORE: US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth on Saturday reassured allies in the Indo-Pacific that they will not be left alone to face increasing military and economic pressures from China.He said Washington will bolster its defences overseas to counter what the Pentagon sees as rapidly developing threats by Beijing, particularly in its aggressive stance toward Taiwan.China has conducted numerous exercises to test what a blockade would look like of the self-governing island, which Beijing claims as its own and the US has pledged to defend.China's army ""is rehearsing for the real deal"", Hegseth said in a keynote speech at a security conference in Singapore.""We are not going to sugarcoat it the threat China poses is real. And it could be imminent.""China has a stated goal of having its military be able to take Taiwan by force if necessary by 2027, a deadline that is seen by experts as more of an aspirational goal than a hard war deadline.But China has also developed sophisticated man-made islands in the South China Sea to support new military outposts and built up highly advanced hypersonic and space capabilities, which are driving the US to create its own space-based ""Golden Dome"" missile defences.Speaking at the Shangri-La Dialogue, a global security conference hosted by the International Institute for Security Studies, Hegseth said China is no longer just building up its military forces to take Taiwan, it's ""actively training for it, every day"".Hegseth also called out China for its ambitions in Latin America, particularly its efforts to increase its influence over the Panama Canal.He repeated a pledge made by previous administrations to bolster US military capabilities in the region to provide a more robust deterrent.While both the Obama and Biden administrations had also committed to pivoting to the Pacific -- and even established new military agreements throughout the region -- a full shift has never been realised.Instead, US military resources from the Indo-Pacific have been regularly pulled to support military needs in the Middle East and Europe, especially since the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.In the first few months of President Donald Trump's second term, that's also been the case.The Indo-Pacific nations caught in between have tried to balance relations with both the US and China over the years.Beijing is the primary trading partner for many, but is also feared as a regional bully, in part due to its increasingly aggressive claims on natural resources such as critical fisheries.Hegseth cautioned that playing both sides, seeking U.S. military support and Chinese economic support, carries risk.""Beware the leverage the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) seeks with that entanglement,"" Hegseth said.China usually sends its own defence minister to this conference -- but in a snub this year to the US and the erratic tariff war Trump has ignited with Beijing, its minister Dong Jun did not attend, something the US delegation said it intended to capitalise on.""We are here this morning. And somebody else isn't,"" Hegseth said.He urged countries in the region to increase defence spending to levels similar to the 5 per cent of their gross domestic product European nations are now pressed to contribute.""We must all do our part,"" Hegseth said.It's not clear if the US can or wants to supplant China as the region's primary economic driver. But Hegseth's push follows Trump's visit to the Middle East, which resulted in billions of dollars in new defence agreements.Hegseth said committing US support for Indo-Pacific nations would not be based on any conditions on local governments aligning their cultural or climate issues with the West.",US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth reassured allies in the Indo-Pacific that they will not be left alone to face increasing military and economic pressures from China.

A paraglider in China who had intended to simply test some equipment instead ended up unwittingly reaching barely survivable heights last week.Peng Yujiang, a 55-year-old paraglider in Gansu province, on Saturday morning flew nearly 8,600 meters above sea level -- more than 28,200 feet, or about 5.3 miles -- in the Qilian mountain range of northwest China's Qinghai and Gansu provinces, according to state media.The episode was captured on a camera attached to his equipment and showed the harrowing conditions he experienced. Peng rose to a level almost on par with Mount Everest's summit and aviation flight paths. His face and body are covered in frost and ice in the video, which was originally posted to social media and later shared by Chinese state media.""I felt the lack of oxygen. My hands were frozen outside. I kept trying to talk on the radio,"" Peng said in a video recorded after the incident, according to Sixth Tone, an English-language, Chinese state-owned outlet.According to local news media, Peng was testing equipment as part of ""ground handling training"" -- a step that paragliders say is critical to managing safe launches -- at an altitude of 3,000 meters above sea level, or about 10,000 feet. But a strong wind suddenly lifted him into the sky. He could not control the glider or land as the draft grew stronger and he was pulled up above the clouds.Peng was apparently the victim of a potentially dangerous phenomenon that paragliders call ""cloud suck,"" in which a pilot is rapidly drawn upward into a cloud.At extreme altitudes, people risk hypoxia, or oxygen deprivation, because of the thin air. Severe hypoxia can cause organ damage or death.Still, Peng managed to land about 20 miles away from where he took off. In stable health and recovering from his surprise flight, he has since said, ""Thinking about it still makes me quite scared,"" China Daily reported Thursday.The local sporting authority in Gansu province said Wednesday that Peng, who is a licensed paraglider, would be barred from the sport for six months; it also noted that flying activities at sites in the area would be suspended for an unspecified period, local news media reported. But the association deemed Peng's incident an accident, based on his statement that he did not have a flight planned and was doing ground handling training, which does not require participants to register plans in advance, the reports said.A second pilot was also banned from flying for six months, because he released footage of the incident without permission, the authority's report said, according to the South China Morning Post.Peng was not the first paraglider to accidentally reach such extreme heights.In 2007, Ewa Wisnierska, a champion Polish paraglider who competed on the German national team, reached around 10,000 meters, or over 32,000 feet, accidentally breaking the paragliding height record on a practice flight in Australia, just days before the World Paragliding Championships. Her 6-mile ascent was treacherous, and she passed out in the air, eventually landing more than 50 miles away from where she took off, on a farm.Another paraglider who was caught in cloud suck that day did not survive.""Today, I still fly -- but just for pleasure and to give courses to the people who come to my paragliding school. Competing no longer makes any sense to me,"" Wisnierska told People magazine last year. ""This definitely changed a lot of priorities and made me realize that there are much more important things in life than championship cups and medals. I often ask myself why was it that I survived and this other pilot did not?""","Peng Yujiang, a 55-year-old paraglider in Gansu province, flew nearly 8,600 meters above sea level.

Viral: MIT Grad Wears Arab Headscarf; Torches Alma Mater’s Israel Ties In Viral Speech |Megha Vemuri





At an already fractious time in US academia, an Indian-American undergrad at the famed Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) torched her own alma mater's ties to the Israeli military and spoke up for Palestine in the face of growing pressure from the Trump administration on US institutions to clamp down on criticism of Israel.Megha Vemuri, a senior class president at MIT, did not hold back during a graduation ceremony on Thursday, accusing Israel of trying to ""wipe Palestine off the face of the earth,"" and lamenting ""it is a shame that MIT is a part of it.""""Right now, while we prepare to graduate and move forward with our lives, there are no universities left in Gaza,"" Vemuri, who completed her undergraduate degree in computer science, neuroscience, and linguistics and served as president of the graduating class, said in remarks that was greeted with cheers from students at the convocation.Vemuri trained her guns on MIT itself and recalled that students scored a major victory earlier this year, forcing MIT to end its partnership with Elbit Systems, who are Israel’s largest weapons manufacturer, whose drones and surveillance systems are said to have been widely used in Israeli attacks on Gaza.""The Israeli occupation forces are the only foreign military that MIT has research ties with. As scientists, engineers, academics, and leaders, we have a commitment to support life.Support aid efforts, call for an arms embargo, and keep demanding that MIT cuts the ties,"" Vemuri said.MIT President Sally Kornbluth, who spoke immediately after Vemuri, ignored her criticism of MIT, and while acknowledging the institution valued freedom of expression, she said, ""Today is about the graduates,"" a sentiment shared by critics who accused her of political grandstanding instead of focusing on academics.""Graduation speeches are meant to inspire, not divide. Turning a shared moment into a personal political stage, especially with such a charged issue, is unfair to fellow students,"" one critic wrote on social media, where clips of her speech went viral.Others found her remarks courageous and inspirational. ""Her speech makes me proud as an Indian! Well done here, on the right side of history,"" read one of hundreds of reactions on X, even as more extreme critics doxxed her and warned that she would never be able to get a job.Vemuri's remarks came even as US secretary of state Marco Rubio had announced that the Trump administration would deny visas to foreign nationals who come to the United States to foment hatred against the Jewish community.While few details are available on the young undergrad, she appears to be a US-born daughter of immigrants from India.

JD Vance speaks up amid H-1B row: 'This idea that American citizens don't have talent to do great things...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jd-vance-speaks-up-amid-h-1b-row-this-idea-that-american-citizens-dont-have-talent-to-do-great-things-/articleshow/121520214.cms,"JD Vance said what he thinks about foreign students in US.





Vice President JD Vance broke his silence amid the ongoing H-1B row and the controversy over the Donald Trump administration's crackdown on universities. In an interview with the Newsmax, Vance dismissed criticisms that the crackdown will lead to an academic brain drain in the US.""First of all, I've heard a lot of the criticisms, the fear that we're going to have a brain drain,"" Vance said. ""If you go back to the '50s and '60s, the American space program, the program that was the first to put a human being on the surface of the moon, was built by American citizens — some German and Jewish scientists who had come over during World War II, but mostly, by American citizens who built an incredible space program with American talent,"" Vance said.""This idea that American citizens don't have the talent to do great things ... do you have to import a foreign class of [students] and professors to do these things? I just reject it. I just think we should invest in our own people. We can do a lot of good.""Vance's comments came amid a fresh row over H-1B as the USCIS revealed that they have selected 120.141 H-1B visa applications for 2026. Several companies, including Walmart, announced job cuts, enraging US workers as they allege that the administration is not doing enough to put Americans first -- as companies are still relying on cheap labor from outside.Moving on to his second point, Vance defended the crackdown on universities and said, ""These institutions do an important job; but if you back up and look at American higher education over the past 20 or 30 years, there are a few incontrovertible facts.""""No. 1, the hard sciences, particularly biology, we have a terrible what is called a reproducibility crisis, meaning most of the papers that are published in biology don't replicate; they're not good science. So even our elite universities are not often doing good science.""Second important point, these institutions — sometimes by their own admission — are engaging in explicit racial discrimination, often against whites and Asians in explicit violation of the Civil Rights Act. If the people's government can't come in, given those problems, and say, 'Look, we've got to have some accountability here; you can't violate the Civil Rights Act,'"" he continued.""We've got to make sure that if we're funding science with federal money, you're actually doing good science. That's called accountability.""Vance said this is not 'fascism' and if the American taxpayer is frustrated with these universities, they have got to reform. ""What they're doing instead, what too many of them are doing and saying, 'Aw, the Trump administration, this is dictatorial, this is fascism.' No, this is democratic accountability, and I think universities ought to see it as an opportunity. If they do that, they're going to get better, and the American people will be better off because of it,"" he said.","Vice President JD Vance broke his silence amid the ongoing H-1B row and the controversy over the Donald Trump administration's crackdown on universities.

The Bluesky post on Katie Miller, Stephen Miller and Elon Musk went viral.





Katie Miller was one of the advisors who decided to work for Elon Musk full time as Musk exited the White House wrapping his DOGE work up. Katie Miller was working as DOGE's spokesperson and as the bridge between DOGE and the administration.

It claimed that Stephen even claimed to people that he runs Elon Musk. But now Katie is choosing Musk over him, not only workwise but also in their relationships and that led to Stephen Miller's meltdown on X as he defended Donald Trump's 'Big, beautiful bill' that Elon Musk didn't like.But Stephen praised Elon Musk too.

"'They do it through bullets, we do it through trade': Donald Trump 'most proud' of India-Pakistan ceasefire deal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/they-do-it-through-bullets-we-do-it-through-trade-donald-trump-most-proud-of-india-pakistan-ceasefire-deal-us-claims-credit-for-ceasefire/articleshow/121528963.cms,"



US President Donald Trump on Friday (local time) reiterated his claim that the United States mediated a ceasefire between India and Pakistan following heightened tensions earlier this month, this time linking the resolution to trade pressure. Trump said, “We talk trade, and we say we can’t trade with people who are shooting at each other and potentially using nuclear weapons… They understood and they agreed, and that all stopped.”Doubling down on his earlier statements, Trump said, “I think the deal I’m most proud of is the fact that we’re dealing with India, we’re dealing with Pakistan, and we were able to stop potentially a nuclear war through trade as opposed through bullets… Normally they do it through bullets. We do it through trade. So I’m very proud of that.”Also read: Mediation or informal diplomacy? Decoding Trump's claims of brokering India-Pakistan truce Earlier today, he further claimed that American diplomacy helped avert a nuclear conflict. “We stopped India and Pakistan from fighting. I believe that could have turned out into a nuclear disaster, and I want to thank the leaders of India and Pakistan, and I want to thank my people.”The ministry of external affairs (MEA), however, said that the ceasefire was entirely India’s sovereign decision and not the result of external pressure from the time Trump first took credit for the same.Responding to media queries about Trump's comments, the MEA stated, “From the time Op Sindoor started on May 7 till the understanding on cessation of military action on May 10, there were conversations between Indian and US leaders on the evolving military situation. The issue of trade did not come up in any of these discussions.”India also maintained its long-standing position on Pakistan-occupied territory. “That stated policy has not changed. As you are aware, the outstanding matter is the vacation of illegally occupied Indian territory by Pakistan,” the MEA said.The government also rejected Trump’s assertion that trade was used as a tool to prevent escalation, stressing that India’s military response—Operation Sindoor—was in line with its doctrine of calibrated retaliation to terrorism.Trump’s latest comments are part of a series of statements in which he has attempted to portray himself as a global peacemaker, despite Indian officials and analysts repeatedly refuting such claims.","US President Donald Trump on Friday (local time) reiterated his claim that the United States mediated a ceasefire between India and Pakistan.

A Ketamine Habit

Family Secrets

'No Sympathy for This Behavior'





As Elon Musk became one of Donald Trump's closest allies last year, leading raucous rallies and donating about $275 million to help him win the presidency, he was also using drugs far more intensely than previously known, according to people familiar with his activities.Musk's drug consumption went well beyond occasional use. He told people he was taking so much ketamine, a powerful anesthetic, that it was affecting his bladder, a known effect of chronic use. He took Ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms. And he traveled with a daily medication box that held about 20 pills, including ones with the markings of the stimulant Adderall, according to a photo of the box and people who have seen it.It is unclear whether Musk, 53, was taking drugs when he became a fixture at the White House this year and was handed the power to slash the federal bureaucracy. But he has exhibited erratic behavior, insulting Cabinet members, gesturing like a Nazi and garbling his answers in a staged interview.At the same time, Musk's family life has grown increasingly tumultuous as he has negotiated overlapping romantic relationships and private legal battles involving his growing brood of children, according to documents and interviews.On Wednesday evening, Musk announced that he was ending his stint with the government, after lamenting how much time he had spent on politics instead of his businesses.Musk and his lawyer did not respond to requests for comment this week about his drug use and personal life. He has previously said he was prescribed ketamine for depression, taking it about every two weeks. And he told his biographer, ""I really don't like doing illegal drugs.""The White House did not respond to questions about whether it had asked Musk to take drug tests. After this article was published on Friday morning, Harrison Fields, a White House spokesperson, issued a statement to The New York Times crediting Musk with helping cut government waste. He declined to comment on Musk's drug use.As a large government contractor, Musk's aerospace firm, SpaceX, must maintain a drug-free workforce and administers random drug tests to its employees. But Musk has received advance warning of the tests, according to people close to the process. SpaceX did not respond to questions about those warnings.Musk, who joined the president's inner circle after making a vast fortune on cars, satellites and rocket ships, has long been known for grandiose statements and a mercurial personality. Supporters see him as an eccentric genius whose slash-and-burn management style is key to his success.But last year, as he jumped into the political arena, some people who knew him worried about his frequent drug use, mood swings and fixation on having more children. This account of his behavior is based on private messages obtained by The New York Times as well as interviews with more than a dozen people who have known or worked with him.This year, some of his longtime friends have renounced him, pointing to some of his public conduct.""Elon has pushed the boundaries of his bad behavior more and more,"" said Philip Low, a neuroscientist and onetime friend of Musk's who criticized him for his Nazi-like gesture at a rally.And some women are challenging Musk for control of their children.One of his former partners, Claire Boucher, the musician known as Grimes, has been fighting with Musk over their 5-year-old son, known as X. Musk is extremely attached to the boy, taking him to the Oval Office and high-profile gatherings that are broadcast around the world.Boucher has privately complained that the appearances violate a custody settlement in which she and Musk agreed to try to keep their children out of the public eye, according to people familiar with her concerns and the provision, which has not been previously reported. She has told people that she worries about the boy's safety, and that frequent travel and sleep deprivation are harming his health.Another mother, the right-leaning writer Ashley St. Clair, revealed in February that she had a secret relationship with Musk and had given birth to his 14th known child. Musk offered her a large settlement to keep his paternity concealed, but she refused. He sought a gag order in New York to force St. Clair to stop speaking publicly, she said in an interview.Musk has described some of his mental health issues in interviews and on social media, saying in one post that he has felt ""great highs, terrible lows and unrelenting stress."" He has denounced traditional therapy and antidepressants.He plays video games for hours on end. He struggles with binge eating, according to people familiar with his habits, and takes weight-loss medication. And he posts day and night on his social media platform, X.Musk has a history of recreational drug use, The Wall Street Journal reported last year. Some board members at Tesla, his electric vehicle company, have worried about his use of drugs, including Ambien, a sleep medication.In an interview in March 2024, journalist Don Lemon pressed him on his drug use. Musk said he took only ""a small amount"" of ketamine, about once every two weeks, as a prescribed treatment for negative moods.""If you've used too much ketamine, you can't really get work done, and I have a lot of work,"" he said.He had actually developed a far more serious habit, the Times found.Musk had been using ketamine often, sometimes daily, and mixing it with other drugs, according to people familiar with his consumption. The line between medical use and recreation was blurry, troubling some people close to him.He also took Ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms at private gatherings across the United States and in at least one other country, according to those who attended the events.The Food and Drug Administration has formally approved the use of ketamine only as an anesthetic in medical procedures. Doctors with a special license may prescribe it for psychiatric disorders like depression. But the agency has warned about its risks, which came into sharp relief after the death of actor Matthew Perry. The drug has psychedelic properties and can cause dissociation from reality. Chronic use can lead to addiction and problems with bladder pain and control.By the spring of last year, Musk was ramping up criticism of President Joe Biden, particularly his policies on illegal immigration and diversity initiatives.Musk was also facing federal investigations into his businesses. Regulators were looking into crashes of Tesla's self-driving cars and allegations of racism at its factories, among other complaints.""There are at least half a dozen initiatives of significance to take me down,"" he wrote in a text message to someone close to him last May. ""The Biden administration views me as the #2 threat after Trump.""""I can't be president, but I can help Trump defeat Biden and I will,"" he added.He publicly endorsed Trump in July.Around that time, Musk told people that his ketamine use was causing bladder issues, according to people familiar with the conversations.On Oct. 5, he appeared with Trump at a rally for the first time, bouncing up and down around the candidate. That evening, Musk shared his excitement with a person close to him. ""I'm feeling more optimistic after tonight,"" he wrote in a text message. ""Tomorrow we unleash the anomaly in the matrix.""""This is not something on the chessboard, so they will be quite surprised,"" Musk added about an hour later. ""'Lasers' from space.""After Trump won, Musk rented a cottage at Mar-a-Lago, the president-elect's Florida resort, to assist with the transition. Musk attended personnel meetings and sat in on phone calls with foreign leaders. And he crafted plans to overhaul the federal government under the new Department of Government Efficiency.Musk has also been juggling the messy consequences of his efforts to produce more babies.By 2022, Musk, who has married and divorced three times, had fathered six children in his first marriage (including one who died in infancy), as well as two with Boucher. She told people she believed they were in a monogamous relationship and building a family together.But while a surrogate was pregnant with their third child, Boucher was furious to discover that Musk had recently fathered twins with Shivon Zilis, an executive at his brain implant company, Neuralink, according to people familiar with the situation.Musk was by then sounding an alarm that the world's declining birthrates would lead to the end of civilization, publicly encouraging people to have children and donating $10 million to a research initiative on population growth.Privately, he was spending time with Simone and Malcolm Collins, prominent figures in the emerging pronatalist movement, and urging his wealthy friends to have as many children as possible. He believed the world needed more intelligent people, according to people aware of the conversations.Collins declined to comment on his relationship with Musk, but said, ""Elon is one of the people taking this cause seriously.""Even as Musk fathered more children, he favored his son X. By the fall of 2022, during a period when he and Boucher were broken up, he began traveling with the boy for days at a time, often without providing advance notice, according to people familiar with his actions.Boucher reconciled with Musk, only to get another unpleasant surprise. In August 2023, she learned that Zilis was expecting a third child with Musk via surrogacy and was pregnant with their fourth.Boucher and Musk began a contentious custody battle, during which Musk kept X for months. They eventually signed the joint custody agreement that specified keeping their children out of the spotlight.By mid-2023, unknown to either Boucher or Zilis, Musk had started a romantic relationship with St. Clair, the writer, who lives in New York City.St. Clair said in an interview that at first, Musk told her he wasn't dating anyone else. But when she was about six months pregnant, he acknowledged that he was romantically involved with Zilis, who went on to become a more visible fixture in Musk's life.St. Clair said that Musk told her he had fathered children around the world, including one with a Japanese pop star. He said he would be willing to give his sperm to anyone who wanted to have a child.""He made it seem like it was just his altruism and he generally believed these people should just have children,"" St. Clair said.St. Clair said that when she was in a delivery room giving birth in September, Musk told her over disappearing Signal messages that he wanted to keep his paternity and their relationship quiet.On election night, St. Clair and Musk both went to Mar-a-Lago to celebrate Trump's victory. But she had to pretend that she hardly knew him, she said.He offered her $15 million and $100,000 a month until their son turned 21, in exchange for her silence, according to documents reviewed by the Times and first reported by the Journal. But she did not want her son's paternity to be hidden.After she went public in February, ahead of a tabloid story, she sued Musk to acknowledge paternity and, later, to get emergency child support.Musk sought a gag order, claiming that any publicity involving the child, or comments by St. Clair on her experience, would be a security risk for the boy.Some of Musk's onetime friends have aired concerns about what they considered toxic public behavior.In a January newsletter explaining why their friendship had ended, Sam Harris, a public intellectual, wrote that Musk had used his social media platform to defame people and promote lies.""There is something seriously wrong with his moral compass, if not his perception of reality,"" Harris wrote.Later that month, at a Trump inauguration event, Musk thumped his chest and thrust his hand diagonally upward, resembling a fascist salute. ""My heart goes out to you,"" he told the crowd. ""It is thanks to you that the future of civilization is assured.""Musk dismissed the resulting public outcry, saying he had made a ""positive gesture.""Low, who is chief executive of NeuroVigil, a neurotechnology company, was outraged by the performance. He wrote Musk a sharp email, shared with the Times, cursing him ""for giving the Nazi salute.""When Musk didn't respond to the message, Low posted his concerns on social media. ""I have no sympathy for this behavior,"" he wrote on Facebook, referring to the gesture as well as other behaviors. ""At some point, after having repeatedly confronted it in private, I believe the ethical thing to do is to speak out, forcefully and unapologetically.""The next month, Musk once again found himself under scrutiny, this time for an appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington.As he walked onto the stage, he was handed a chain saw from one of his political allies, Javier Milei, the president of Argentina. ""This is the chain saw for bureaucracy!"" Musk shouted to the cheering crowd.Some conference organizers told the Times that they did not notice anything out of the ordinary about his behavior behind the scenes. But during an onstage interview, he spoke in disjointed bouts of stuttering and laughing, with sunglasses on. Clips of it went viral as many viewers speculated about possible drug use.","Elon Musk's drug consumption went well beyond occasional use.

US measles cases rise slightly as Colorado reports a new outbreak,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-measles-cases-rise-slightly-as-colorado-reports-a-new-outbreak/articleshow/121528176.cms,"AP file photo





Measles cases inched up slightly in the US this past week, with a new county impacted in Texas and Colorado reporting a new outbreak.There are 1,088 confirmed measles cases in the US, up 42 from last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. Texas, where the nation's biggest outbreak raged during the late winter and spring, reported 10 additional cases this week for a total of 738.There are three other major outbreaks in North America.One in Ontario, Canada, has resulted in 1,888 cases from mid-October through May 27. Another in Alberta, Canada, has sickened 628 as of Thursday. And the Mexican state of Chihuahua had 1,693 measles cases and three deaths as of Wednesday, according to data from the state health ministry.Since the outbreak in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma began, two elementary school-aged children in the epicenter in West Texas and an adult in New Mexico have died of measles. All were unvaccinated.Other states with active outbreaks, which the CDC defines as three or more related cases, include Colorado, Kansas, Michigan, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Tennessee.Measles is caused by a highly contagious virus that's airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It is preventable through vaccines, and has been considered eliminated from the US since 2000. Here's what else you need to know about measles in the USHow many measles cases are there in Texas? There are a total of 738 cases across 35 counties, most of them in West Texas, state health officials said Friday.Throughout the outbreak, 94 people have been hospitalized. McLennan County, which includes the city of Waco, was added to the state's list of counties with active cases.State health officials estimated less than 1% of cases - fewer than 10 - are actively infectious. Fifty-six percent of Texas' cases are in Gaines County, where the virus started spreading in a close-knit, undervaccinated Mennonite community. The county has had 409 cases since late January - just over 1.7% of the county's residents.The April 3 death in Texas was an 8-year-old child, according to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Local health officials said the child did not have underlying health conditions and died of ""what the child's doctor described as measles pulmonary failure."" A unvaccinated child with no underlying conditions died of measles in Texas in late February; Kennedy said the child was 6.How many measles cases are there in New Mexico? New Mexico added one new case on Friday for a total of 79.Seven people have been hospitalized since the outbreak started. Most of the state's cases are in Lea County. Sandoval County near Albuquerque has six cases, Eddy County has three, Doña Ana County has two and Chaves and Curry counties have one each.An unvaccinated adult died of measles-related illness March 6. The person did not seek medical care.How many cases are there in Oklahoma? Oklahoma held steady Friday with a total of 14 confirmed and three probable cases.The state health department is not releasing which counties have cases.How many cases are there in Colorado? Colorado has seen a total of seven measles cases in 2025 and one outbreak with three related cases, which the state health department announced Thursday.All three cases appear to stem from an international flight that landed at Denver International Airport in mid-May. Two people with confirmed cases live in Arapahoe County, near Denver - one unvaccinated child under the age of 5 and an unrelated vaccinated adult. The other person was an out-of-state traveler who was infectious on the flight and stayed at a hotel near the airport. State health officials said Thursday there is no evidence of further spread.The other counties with cases in 2025 are Pueblo, Jefferson and Archuleta counties with one each and Denver with two.How many cases are there in Kansas? Kansas has a total of 64 cases across 11 counties in the southwestern part of the state, with two hospitalizations. All but five of the cases are connected, and most of the cases are in Gray County.How many cases are there in Michigan? Michigan has a steady eight confirmed cases of measles, with an outbreak of four connected cases in Montcalm County in the western part of the state that health officials say is tied to the Ontario outbreak.How many cases are there in Montana? Montana has 13 measles cases as of Thursday. Ten are in Gallatin County, which is where the first cases showed up - Montana's first in 35 years.Flathead County has two cases and Hill County has one case.Health officials said there is potential for community transmission in Hill County. There are outbreaks in neighboring North Dakota and the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan.How many cases are there in North Dakota? North Dakota, which hadn't seen measles since 2011, is up to 29 cases as of Thursday. Two of the people have been hospitalized, and all of the people with confirmed cases were not vaccinated.There are 13 cases in Williams County in western North Dakota on the Montana border. On the eastern side of the state on the Minnesota border, there are eight cases in Grand Forks County and seven cases in Cass County. Burke County, in northwest North Dakota on the border of Saskatchewan, Canada, has one case.How many cases are there in Ohio? Ohio remained steady for a second week at 34 measles cases and one hospitalization, according to the Ohio Department of Health. That count includes only Ohio residents.The state has two outbreaks: Ashtabula County near Cleveland has 16 cases, and Knox County in east-central Ohio has 20 - 14 among Ohio residents and the rest among visitors.Allen, Cuyahoga, Holmes and Defiance counties have one case each.How many cases are there in Pennsylvania? Pennsylvania remains steady at 15 cases overall in 2025 as of Thursday, including international travel-related cases in Montgomery County and one in Philadelphia.An outbreak of eight measles cases in Erie County in far northwest Pennsylvania has remained steady since it began in mid-April.How many cases are there in Tennessee? Tennessee has had six measles cases since early May, but no change since. Health department spokesman Bill Christian said all cases are the middle part of the state, and that ""at least three of these cases are linked to each other"" but declined to specify further. The state also did not say whether the cases were linked to other outbreaks or when Tennessee's outbreak started.Where else is measles showing up in the US? Measles cases also have been reported in Alaska, Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.Cases and outbreaks in the US are frequently traced to someone who caught the disease abroad. The CDC says more than twice as many measles have come from outside of the US compared to May of last year, and most of those are in unvaccinated Americans returning home. In 2019, the US saw 1,274 cases and almost lost its status of having eliminated measles.What do you need to know about the MMR vaccine? The best way to avoid measles is to get the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.Getting another MMR shot as an adult is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says. People who have documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don't need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective vaccine made from ""killed"" virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said.People who have documentation that they had measles are immune, and those born before 1957 generally don't need the shots because so many children got measles back then that they have ""presumptive immunity.""Measles has a harder time spreading through communities with high vaccination rates - above 95% - due to ""herd immunity."" But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots.What are the symptoms of measles? Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC.Most kids will recover from measles, but infection can lead to dangerous complications such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death.How can you treat measles? There's no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.","There are 1,088 confirmed measles cases in the US, up 42 from last week.

The US state department ordered all its consular offices around the world to carry out extra checks on visa applicants planning to travel to Harvard University for any reason, according to an internal cable reviewed by Reuters on Friday.The May 30 cable, signed by secretary of state Marco Rubio, calls for “additional vetting” of all non-immigrant visa applicants connected to Harvard. This includes students, faculty, staff, contractors, guest speakers, and even tourists. The cable emphasizes the word “any,” using bold and underlined text.The instruction claims Harvard failed to maintain “a campus environment free from violence and anti-Semitism,” and the enhanced vetting aims to help officers identify applicants “with histories of anti-Semitic harassment and violence.”While the US has previously applied tougher vetting for applicants from specific countries, targeting a university is considered unprecedented.The state department declined to comment on internal communications.This action is part of a wider effort by the Trump administration against Harvard. The administration has frozen billions in funding, pushed to end the university’s tax-exempt status, and launched a probe into alleged discrimination against white, Asian, male, or straight individuals.Trump has criticised leading universities for fostering anti-American views. Last week, his administration revoked Harvard’s ability to enroll foreign students—a move that was blocked by a federal judge. Harvard has accused the administration of retaliation for resisting interference in its internal governance, academic content, and campus ideology.Visa approval tied to online transparencyThe cable also directs consular officers to review applicants’ social media. If an applicant’s accounts are private, it may be seen as a sign of “evasiveness.” Officers are told to ask applicants to make their accounts public and may warn that hiding activity could be viewed as suspicious.Officers are also instructed to ensure the applicant’s intended activities in the US match the type of visa they are applying for. If the officer is not “personally and completely satisfied” that the applicant will comply with visa terms, the visa should be denied.The order follows previous steps by Rubio, including halting new visa appointments for student and exchange programs and beginning the revocation of visas for Chinese students linked to the Communist Party or studying sensitive subjects.The cable also states this effort will serve as a “pilot for expanded screening and vetting,” suggesting that similar procedures could be applied to other universities in the future.",The US state department ordered all its consular offices around the world to carry out extra checks on visa applicants planning to travel to Harvard University.

Over 5 lakh face deportation risk as Trump gets go-ahead to end legal status of migrants from US Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/over-5-lakh-face-deportation-risk-as-trump-gets-go-ahead-to-end-legal-status-from-us-supreme-court/articleshow/121527839.cms,"US Supreme Court (Image credits: AP)





The US Supreme Court on Friday allowed the Trump administration to move forward with ending temporary legal protections for more than 500,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. The decision raises the number of migrants newly at risk of deportation to nearly 1 million.The justices lifted a lower-court order that had blocked the administration’s effort to terminate the humanitarian parole program. In a separate case earlier this month, the court allowed the removal of about 350,000 Venezuelan migrants, marking the second time the court has sided with the Trump administration in its push to roll back Biden-era immigration policies.The court issued its order without explanation, which is typical on the emergency docket. Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor dissented, warning of the serious consequences the decision could have on affected migrants.The administration filed an emergency appeal after a federal judge in Boston, Indira Talwani, had stopped the government from ending the program. Judge Talwani had ruled that revoking the protections early would force migrants to either flee the country or face possible deportation.While she allowed revocation on a case-by-case basis, the administration argued that the program was granted en masse and should be ended the same way.Solicitor general D John Sauer called individual review a “gargantuan task” that would slow the government's ability to remove migrants.Justice Jackson echoed concerns from Judge Talwani, writing in her dissent that the court’s order would cause “needless human suffering” before a final legal judgment is reached.The temporary parole program had allowed up to 30,000 people per month from the four countries to enter the US for two years, provided they had a financial sponsor and paid their own travel expenses. These migrants fled instability and dangers in their home countries.The decision also affects other groups covered under humanitarian parole, including Afghans, Ukrainians, and Central American children. The Biden administration had used this authority, in effect since 1952, more extensively than any previous president.Homeland security secretary Kristi Noem cancelled an 18-month extension of the parole protections, giving migrants 30 days to leave unless covered by other legal protections.This marks the first time such a large group has lost parole status at once, with advocates calling it “the largest mass illegalisation event in modern American history.”The Supreme Court's order is not a final decision, but it does mean that the protections will be lifted while the case moves forward. The case now goes back to the 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston.","More than 500,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela are now at risk of deportation.
