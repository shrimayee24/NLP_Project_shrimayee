‘Criminal illegal aliens’: White House flags 'disturbing pattern' after Indian trucker crash in California; calls out 'serious gaps',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/criminal-illegal-aliens-white-house-flags-disturbing-pattern-after-indian-trucker-crash-in-california-calls-out-serious-gaps/articleshow/124776067.cms,"Jashanpreet Singh has been arrested for driving a truck under the influence and killing 3 in California.

ICE Puts Illegal Indian Trucker On Notice After California Crash | ‘High On Drugs, Didn’t Brake’





White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Thursday highlighted what she called a “disturbing pattern” of criminal illegal aliens being issued commercial driver’s licenses (CDLs), after trucker Jashanpreet Singh, a 21-year-old 'illegal' immigrant from India, was charged in a California crash that killed three people.Leavitt accused California of issuing a CDL to Singh, who drove under the influence and caused a fiery pile-up on Interstate 10 earlier this week. The Department of Transportation (DoT) has launched an investigation into how Singh obtained his license.“California gave this individual a license, and it’s something the Department of Transportation has already looked into,” Leavitt said during a White House briefing. “Secretary Duffy has been cracking down on licenses being wrongfully issued to people who clearly should not hold such positions.”""As for this case in California, on October 22, ICE lodged an immigration detainer for this individual following his arrest by local authorities in California on charges of manslaughter while intoxicated and driving under the influence. He killed three people. And he first entered the United States in 2022 through the southern border.And he was released into our country by the previous administration. ICE has lodged a separate detainer for this individual. And these tragedies are following a disturbing pattern of these criminal illegal aliens being issued commercial vehicle licenses. The Department of Transportation is absolutely cracking down on that,"" she said.Singh, who entered the US illegally through the southern border in 2022, was released pending an immigration hearing under the Biden administration’s “alternatives to detention” policy. He has since been arrested and charged with gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and driving under the influence causing injury.Federal authorities confirmed that ICE has lodged a detainer against him following his arrest.Dashcam footage from the crash showed Singh’s semi-truck slamming into multiple vehicles on the I-10 freeway in San Bernardino County, killing three people and injuring four others. Investigators say he was impaired and never hit the brakes before impact.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said Singh’s case reflects a broader safety concern involving commercial drivers who lack proper immigration status or English proficiency.Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy renewed criticism of California’s licensing policies, arguing that the state’s refusal to enforce federal English-language requirements for truck drivers has created safety risks.“This tragedy wouldn’t have happened if Governor Newsom had followed the new rules,” Duffy said, adding that the federal government will withhold $40 million in highway safety funds from California for failing to comply.California officials, however, said Singh’s federal work authorization was approved multiple times by the US government — allowing him to legally obtain a commercial license under existing law.The fatal crash follows another high-profile incident in Florida, where Harjinder Singh, also an Indian national who entered the US illegally in 2018, was charged in August for a truck crash that killed three people. Both cases have reignited debate over immigration, licensing, and road safety in the trucking industry.Immigrants make up nearly one in five long-haul truck drivers in the US, according to the American Trucking Associations.","Jashanpreet Singh, a 21-year-old 'illegal' immigrant from India, was charged in a California crash that killed three people.

The case had been registered by Vadakkencherry police after parents complained that the teacher struck their children on the legs during class at 10am on Sept 16, 2019. The complaint was lodged four days later on Sept 20.The court said there was no explanation for the delay and no proof the children suffered injuries, indicating that only minimal force was used. It found that the teacher had “no intention to cause harm beyond what was necessary to enforce discipline” and had acted with restraint.Calling the prosecution “unfortunate”, the court said parents failed to appreciate the teacher’s intentions. It said when a child is entrusted to a teacher, there is implied consent for the teacher to exercise parental authority to correct the pupil.With that reasoning, HC quashed the criminal proceedings, affirming a teacher’s right to maintain discipline within reasonable limits.","Kerala high court quashes criminal case against schoolteacher who caned three class 5 students for fighting.

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi spoke to his Malaysian counterpart Anwar Ibrahim and conveyed that he will virtually attend India-Asean summit Sunday, scotching speculation of a meeting with US President Donald Trump on the margins of Asean and East Asia summits in Kuala Lumpur.The ostensible reason for the rare miss to the summit by Modi might be preoccupation with Bihar assembly elections but it also spares him the discomfiture of running into the mercurial president in the middle of a US-India trade deadlock and growing differences over Pakistan-related issues.According to Ibrahim, Modi told him he would attend virtually “given Deepavali festival was still being celebrated in India at that time”. “I respect the decision and extend my Deepavali greetings to him and all the people of India,” said Ibrahim on X. In his own post on the same platform, Modi congratulated Ibrahim on Malaysia’s Asean chairmanship and conveyed best wishes for the success of upcoming summits.“Look forward to deepening of Asean-India Comprehensive Strategic Partnership,” said Modi. MEA later said in a statement that foreign minister S Jaishankar will represent Modi at East Asia Summit on Oct 27.In their conversation late on Wednesday, Ibrahim said India remains an important partner of Malaysia in trade and investment, technology, education and regional security sectors.Meanwhile, Congress on Thursday said the PM decided against visiting Malaysia to avoid “being cornered by Trump” and asked if this was the reason Modi did not travel to Egypt for Gaza peace summit helmed by Trump a few days back.Congress spokesperson Jairam Ramesh said Modi posting messages in praise of Trump on social media is one thing but to be seen hobnobbing in person with a man who has “claimed 53 times that he stopped Operation Sindoor and has claimed five times that India has promised to stop buying oil from Russia” is another matter which “is far too risky for him”.",The ostensible reason for the rare miss to the summit by Modi might be preoccupation with Bihar assembly elections.

Bihar polls: Mukesh Sahani emerges as Mahagathbandhan's wildcard; is Congress the weakest link?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-polls-mukesh-sahani-emerges-as-mahagathbandhans-wildcard-is-congress-the-weakest-link/articleshow/124766308.cms,"Tejashwi Yadav Named CM Face, BJP Retaliates with ‘Weak Alliance’ Remark at Mahagathbandhan

Tejashwi formally declared CM face, Sahani named his deputy





Mukesh Sahani: From political exile to deputy CM face





Congress on shaky ground?





The weakest link?





NEW DELHI: The Mahagathbandhan on Thursday announced Tejashwi Yadav as its chief ministerial candidate and Mukesh Sahani as the deputy CM face ahead of the Bihar assembly elections. While Tejashwi’s candidature was widely expected, Sahani’s unexpected rise - from a one-time NDA ally often dismissed by rivals to a key power centre within the alliance has become the defining development, signalling a shift in the coalition’s caste arithmetic and leadership dynamics.Behind the show of unity, however, tensions simmer. As Sahani celebrates his political revival, Congress appears to be the uneasy partner in this new equation. Grassroots dissatisfaction over ticket distribution, coupled with its declining influence in seat-sharing talks, raises questions about whether the grand old party is losing ground within Bihar’s opposition bloc.The Mahagathbandhan formally announced Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader and former deputy chief minister Tejashwi Yadav as its chief ministerial face for the 2025 Bihar Assembly elections. Alongside, Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) chief Mukesh Sahani was declared the alliance’s deputy chief ministerial candidate.The announcement, made during a joint press conference of alliance partners in Patna, ended weeks of speculation over leadership and marked a new phase of coordination within the opposition bloc.Senior Congress leader and election observer Ashok Gehlot said, “All of us sitting here have decided that in these elections, we support Tejashwi Yadav as the CM face.”He confirmed that the Mahagathbandhan would contest the upcoming polls in complete unity, adding that Sahani would serve as Tejashwi’s deputy if the alliance comes to power.Mukesh Sahani’s recent elevation marks a remarkable political comeback. The Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) had originally been part of the Mahagathbandhan, but disagreements over seat-sharing—stemming from the Rashtriya Janata Dal’s reluctance to prioritise smaller allies—led Sahani to exit the coalition. He later joined the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and was allotted 11 seats in the 2020 Bihar elections. Although Sahani lost his own contest, his party managed to win four seats.Sahani was subsequently elected to the Bihar Legislative Council, albeit for a shorter term of one and a half years, which expired in July 2022.Once an NDA ally, Sahani faced political isolation after his fallout with the BJP. His decision to contest against the BJP in both the Bihar Legislative Council and Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections further marginalized him, with several VIP MLAs defecting to the BJP in 2022. In the 2022 Uttar Pradesh elections, Sahani announced plans to field 160 candidates to “oust the incumbent BJP government,” and in Bihar, he fielded 55 candidates against his former ally—but none won. Following these setbacks, a BJP MLA suggested that Sahani’s political chapter in Bihar was over, hinting at his removal as minister and even a potential internal coup within the VIP. Sahani also defied NDA seat-sharing arrangements in the Bihar Legislative Council elections, fielding seven candidates against the BJP once again.In 2025, however, Sahani has staged a political revival, now named the deputy chief ministerial candidate of the opposition bloc.Speaking to reporters in Patna ahead of the announcement, he appeared confident: “Why would I have a problem with anything? Can't you tolerate so much happiness on my face? Mahagathbandhan is moving forward very strongly.”His elevation seems a calculated strategy by the Mahagathbandhan to consolidate Nishad (fishermen) votes and appeal to smaller caste groups that have drifted away from the major alliances. The support base for the Vikassheel Insaan Party consists mainly of the Nishad, Nonia, Bind, Beldar community, which comprises 20 sub-castes of fisherman and boatmen. It also signals social inclusivity — a card the RJD-led bloc has traditionally used effectively in Bihar’s caste-driven politics.While the alliance celebrated unity on stage, discontent brewed within the Congress. In recent weeks, several party workers have expressed anger over the ticket distribution process, alleging bias and manipulation by senior leaders in charge of Bihar affairs.Congress worker Munna Shahi told ANI, “Those whom Rahul Gandhi had entrusted and sent here are from the five-star hotel culture, and they don't like to be brought down to poor ashrams here... We have only one demand, 'ticket chor, gaddi chod'... The selection process has lost its basis. Only eye wash remains now.”After the Congress CEC meeting on Bihar polls, another worker said, “It was said that those people who will be on the screening committee, those who will have their online application will be given tickets. But a few leaders like Krishna Allavaru and Rajesh Ram are making women work hard and go from door to door but cheating them at the end. The promise made by Rahul Gandhi, to honour the youth and women is being broken by Krishna Allavaru. We, the Congress workers, will not stand it. Bihar will not accept it.”Interestingly, on Thursday elevating Congress also replaced Allavaru as Youth Congress chief and brought in Manish Sharma.The internal tensions in the recent weeks by local leaders point to a widening gap between the Congress high command and its state unit. This recurring issue has hurt the party’s performance in multiple states.The Mahagathbandhan’s recalibrated leadership matrix leaves the Congress in an uncomfortable spot. With the RJD holding the chief ministerial claim and the VIP now rewarded with the deputy slot, Congress finds itself without a distinct bargaining chip. Its performance in the 2020 polls, where it contested 70 seats but won only 19, has weakened its ability to negotiate.The current configuration suggests a more RJD-centric alliance, with Tejashwi and Sahani symbolising the blend of legacy and new social representation, while Congress remains peripheral.The joint manifesto of the Mahagathbandhan is set to be released on October 28, after Chhath Puja, with Congress leaders Mallikarjun Kharge and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra expected to join the campaign. However, unless it manages to address internal dissent and project a clear message, Congress could risk further erosion in Bihar’s evolving political narrative.The Bihar assembly elections will be held in two phases on November 6 and 11, with results scheduled for November 14. The Mahagathbandhan — comprising RJD, Congress, CPI, CPI(M), CPI-ML, and Mukesh Sahani’s VIP — faces the NDA alliance led by BJP and JD(U), along with the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) and HAM(S).",The Mahagathbandhan on Thursday announced Tejashwi Yadav as its chief ministerial candidate.

"Collegium preserves judiciary’s autonomy, say CJI B R Gavai, Justice Kant",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/collegium-preserves-judiciarys-autonomy-say-cji-b-r-gavai-justice-kant/articleshow/124772986.cms,"NEW DELHI: CJI B R Gavai and Justice Surya Kant, the next CJI, on Thursday stoutly defended the much-criticised collegium system for selecting constitutional court judges and said it has helped the judiciary preserve its autonomy and independence in administration of justice.CJI Gavai was speaking at Royal Institute of Management in Thimphu, Bhutan, while Justice Kant was addressing Sri Lankan Supreme Court in Colombo. The CJI cited SC’s 2015 judgment striking down the National Judicial Appointments Commission and said granting primary control over judicial appointments to the executive would imperil the independence and autonomy of the judiciary.Justice Kant said the judiciary’s dominant role in appointment of judges to HCs and SC is a compelling “illustration of the doctrine of separation of powers”. The judiciary’s independence and autonomy help it to go beyond simple resolution of disputes or defending constitutional boundaries; it has allowed constitutional courts actively “shape the democratic imagination of a society and to function as architects of democratic life”, he held.Justice Kant said that if separation of powers is the framework of India’s constitutional democracy, then judicial review — Article 32 (a person can approach SC directly over violation of fundamental rights) and Article 226 (a person can file a writ petition in an HC) — is the sustaining force of democracy.The ambit of judicial review extends to constitutional functionaries like EC, Lok Sabha speaker and governors, as well as legislative assemblies. “No act of governance is beyond the purview of judicial oversight,” he stressed.“This expansive power of review is a cornerstone of India’s constitutional democracy and a part of our basic structure, affirming that legality and constitutionality are fundamental preconditions to the exercise of public power,” Justice Kant said.In what reflects the judiciary’s transformative potential to give voice to the voiceless, Justice Kant said, judicial interpretation has resulted in expanding the scope of fundamental rights, leading to legislative action.CJI Gavai said that apart from the broad and purposive interpretation of Article 21 (right to life), SC has consistently held the state accountable for safeguarding and promoting the rights of citizens, compelling govts to translate constitutional guarantees into tangible actions.Public interest litigation (PIL) has evolved as an instrument for protecting human rights and the rights of marginalised and vulnerable communities like bonded labour, undertrial prisoners, migrant workers, manual scavengers, sex workers and pavement dwellers. SC has also brought in electoral reforms by acting on PILs, the CJI said.Justice Kant disagreed with criticism that judicial activism often results in encroachment of the turfs of legislature and executive, and said, “When courts act to empower the powerless, grounded in constitutional text and moral clarity, they do not usurp democracy, they deepen it.”Both the CJI and Justice Kant referred to SC’s landmark 13-judge judgment in the Kesavananda Bharati case in 1973 that established the doctrine of ‘basic structure of the Constitution’. “That judgment transformed the judiciary from a mere interpreter of the Constitution into its guardian,” Justice Kant said.","CJI B R Gavai and Justice Surya Kant, the next CJI, stoutly defended the much- criticised collegium system for selecting constitutional court judges.

DNA samples from the parents of the two babies — a boy and a girl born on Oct 21 — were sent to the forensic science laboratory in Jaipur Thursday to resolve the issue.The dispute arose from two deliveries made 43 minutes apart in the same operation theatre on Oct 21, where Anita Rawat from Udaipur and Rameshwari Soni from Chittorgarh gave birth to a boy and a girl.One of the families alleged that the hospital initially handed them a newborn boy and took the child back an hour later, claiming it had given them the wrong infant, and the baby born to them was a girl. “We protested and filed a complaint at Hathi Pole PS.

NEW DELHI: More than 100 people, most of them children aged between 8 and 14, were hospitalised in Bhopal and neighbouring Vidisha district after using calcium carbide guns during Diwali celebrations, officials said on Thursday.Around 60 children are being treated in government hospitals in the state capital, while 50 others are under care in Vidisha. At least five of them have suffered serious eye injuries.“These carbide pipe guns are extremely dangerous,” said Bhopal’s chief medical health officer (CMHO) Manish Sharma, as quoted by PTI. “All 60 injured in Bhopal are still being treated, though their condition is stable.” Patients have been admitted to Hamidia Hospital, JP Hospital, AIIMS Bhopal, and Seva Sadan Hospital.The makeshift guns are made using plastic pipes, gas lighters, and calcium carbide. When carbide comes into contact with water, it produces acetylene gas, which explodes when sparked. The blast ejects small plastic fragments that can pierce the skin, face, or eyes.Doctors said over 150 cases were reported in Bhopal the day after Diwali, though many victims were discharged after first aid. A 12-year-old child at AIIMS is undergoing surgery to restore vision, while two other children are being treated for similar injuries at Hamidia Hospital.In Vidisha, 50 people were injured by carbide gun blasts. Dr R K Sahu, head of the ophthalmology department at Vidisha District Hospital said they were trying to restore the eyesight of five patients. Ten patients have been admitted in the past two days.Dr S C L Chandravanshi from Vidisha Medical College said 20 patients were brought in this week, including one child who required eye surgery.Families of injured children have blamed the administration for failing to stop the sale of carbide guns. “Such guns should not be sold at all,” said Sarikh Khan, father of a 15-year-old being treated at Hamidia Hospital. “Those selling and manufacturing them must be punished.”Authorities said action is being taken. Vidisha SP Rohit Kashwani confirmed that 228 plastic guns and 102 carbide packets were seized, and a dozen people have been detained.Chief minister Mohan Yadav had earlier instructed district officials to ban the sale of carbide guns. Despite that, the items were widely available in local markets during Diwali, sources admitted, reported PTI.","Around 60 children are being treated in government hospitals in the state capital, while 50 others are under care in Vidisha.

"No discussion on Pakistan in Modi-Trump phone call, says government; PM may address Asean virtually",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-discussion-on-pakistan-in-modi-trump-phone-call-says-government-pm-may-address-asean-virtually/articleshow/124747878.cms,"PM Modi Confirmed to Give ASEAN Summit a Miss, Avoids Trump Again: Here’s The Real Reason Why

Despite the recent show of bonhomie between PM Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump, India and the US again seemed at odds over talks between the leaders as the Indian government denied that they discussed Pakistan in Trump’s Diwali phone call to Modi.It’s also learnt that India is exploring the possibility of Modi addressing the Asean/ East Asia summit meetings in Malaysia virtually later this week, apparently because of the elections in Bihar. This would rule out any likelihood in the near future of an in-person encounter with Trump. The US president said this week he will be in Malaysia for the annual event. He is unlikely to travel though to South Africa for the G20 summit next month, where Modi will be present.Modi has rarely skipped in-person participation in the Asean/ East Asia summit meetings. The PM had earlier this month declined Egypt’s invitation for the Gaza peace summit that was co-chaired by Trump. India has not been enthused by the prospect of a meeting with Trump in the absence of any breakthrough in the trade negotiations, as also the president’s claims ad nauseam about having ended a war between India and Pakistan, but government sources said the likely decision to opt out of in-person participation may also be related to the focus on Bihar elections Trump said at a Diwali event on Tuesday that he had spoken to Modi and that they had also discussed the need to avoid a war between India and Pakistan. The PM had later in a post on X expressed hope that the 2 countries will stand united against terrorism in all its forms, venting India’s concerns about Islamabad’s growing proximity with Washington under Trump but without naming Pakistan.“Pakistan was not discussed during the phone call between the PM and President Trump,” said a source here, on condition of anonymity.This was the second time in the past 2 weeks that India has denied Trump’s claim that he has tagged to conversations with Modi. India had said last week it wasn’t aware of the conversation between Modi and Trump during which, according to Trump, the Indian PM assured him India would stop buying oil from Russia.The India-US relationship has been making headlines because of the differences over trade but Trump’s unabashed courting of Pakistan has also been a source of unease in bilateral ties for India. Even as India maintains that the ceasefire after Operation Sindoor in May was directly negotiated between the 2 militaries, Trump has not backed down from his claim that he ended the conflict with his threat to impose trade tariffs on India and Pakistan. The relationship saw a dramatic downturn after Modi declined Trump’s invitation in June this year to visit the White House. The visit was always a non-starter for Modi, as Pakistan army chief Asim Munir was also being feted there at the same time.",Indian government denies that they discussed Pakistan in Trump’s Diwali phone call to Modi.

As the United States faces its second-longest government shutdown in recent history, Democrats are urging President Donald Trump to cancel his upcoming trip to Asia and focus on resolving the domestic crisis.The MAGA chief is scheduled to depart late Friday for Malaysia, with stops in Japan and South Korea, where he will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping next Thursday.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called it “outrageous” for Trump to leave the country while Americans suffer.“Shouldn't the president listen to the cares of the American people and their desperate need on health care, rather than taking a foreign trip?” Schumer asked.Senator Jeff Merkley, who held a marathon speech on the Senate floor in protest of Trump administration policies, described the planned trip as “horrific.”“He absolutely should be sitting down right now and holding a conversation with you about how we solve this problem for millions of Americans,” Merkley said.Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries requested a meeting with Trump earlier this week to discuss ending the shutdown, but Trump responded that he will only meet with Democratic leaders once the government reopens.""I would like to meet with both of them, but I said one little caveat, I will only meet if they let the country open,"" Trump told reporters earlier this week, according to USA Today. Republican lawmakers have largely refused to negotiate until the shutdown ends, while Democrats continue to demand health care reforms in exchange for reopening the government.This will be Trump’s first trip to Asia since returning to the Oval Office in January.

West Bengal Police Arrest Three in Connection with Durgapur Gang-Rape Case





BENGALURU: Bengaluru Rural police have arrested three youths in connection with the alleged gang-rape of a 27-year-old woman near Nelamangala Tuesday night. The survivor, originally from West Bengal, works as a beautician for weddings and other functions and lives with her husband and two sons. Another woman from her hometown and a man from Assam, a friend of her husband, also reside in the adjacent rented house. Her husband was at work when the incident occurred, according to sources.As per the survivor's complaint, five men barged into the house, claiming to be local police, around 9:30pm on Oct 21. ""They accused us of possessing ganja and being involved in a flesh trade, and demanded Rs 1 lakh. They then attacked me and another woman with a cricket bat and a machete. My friend nearly lost consciousness, but I managed to resist. They gagged my younger son and my husband's friend, locking them in the toilet. Three of them dragged me to a room in the adjacent house and raped me. They also robbed Rs 25,000 and two mobile phones,"" the survivor stated in her complaint.Her elder son, who was outside at the time, contacted the police control room. A patrolling Hoysala police vehicle soon arrived at the scene, but the suspects had fled the scene by then.The survivor, who was immediately shifted to a nearby hospital, filed her complaint from her hospital bed. Madanayakanahalli police registered a case of gang-rape under Section 70 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita and launched a manhunt and in less than two days, cops detained a few suspects, including juveniles, for questioning.""By Wednesday night we arrested the accused – Naveen, Kartik, and Glani – and Thursday afternoon, three more suspects—Suyog, Jangli Prithvi, and Seena—were taken into custody.

After responding to a neighborhood complaint about the noise, Naskar found himself facing the wrath of festive revellers who launched a dangerous assault on him and his loved ones.





KOLKATA: A 35-year-old resident of Sonarpur's Kustia was murdered on Wednesday night by revellers after he switched off the blaring music that was playing for three nights at a stretch.The victim, Sanatan Naskar, a peon at a private office, was allegedly stabbed to death by a neighbour during the altercation over the use of a sound system at a Kali Puja pandal. Police have arrested a couple — Pintu Saha and his wife — in connection with the killing. They are also on the lookout for two of Pintu's relatives.According to police sources, loud music was playing in the neighbourhood for three consecutive nights as part of Kali Puja celebrations. On Wednesday night, a nearby resident objected to the blaring sound, saying that a member of her family was a heart patient. Responding to her plea, Sanatan, who owned the sound system, switched off the speakers and returned home.This infuriated Pintu and his associates, who rented the sound system for the event. They allegedly stormed into Sanatan's house and demanded that the music be resumed. When Sanatan refused, the argument turned violent.The group first assaulted Sanatan's mother and brother before attacking him. One of the attackers allegedly pulled out a knife and stabbed him multiple times. He was rushed to a nearby hospital, where doctors declared him brought dead.As news of the murder spread, local residents caught hold of Pintu and his wife while they were allegedly trying to flee the area and handed them over to Sonarpur police.

NEW DELHI: At least 20 people were killed after a private Kaveri Travels bus caught fire on Friday following a collision with a bike at Chinna Tekuru village in Andhra Pradesh's Kurnool district.The blaze erupted within minutes, trapping passengers inside and leaving many charred to death.Preliminary investigations revealed that the bus hit a bike, which went under the vehicle and caught fire, eventually causing the bus to explode.The private bus was travelling from Hyderabad to Bengaluru with over 40 passengers on board.DIG Koya Praveen said that while the impact with the bike ignited the fire, combustible materials inside the bus contributed to many deaths.He added that the fuel tank remained intact and the bus lacked adequate safety measures to prevent or mitigate fire incidents.Dr Siri said that 21 people have been traced so far. Of the remaining 20, 11 bodies have been identified, while 9 are yet to be identified.She also noted that the bus door got jammed after the fire broke out, preventing passengers from escaping.Twelve passengers managed to escape through windows, many sustaining burn injuries, while others were trapped as the blaze spread rapidly.The Kurnool tragedy comes just days after a similar bus fire in Rajasthan, where 22 people, including three children, were killed near Thaiyat village on October 14.Investigations revealed a short circuit in the air-conditioning system caused that blaze, confirmed by FSL, transport department, and CIRT teams.","A private Kaveri Travels bus caught fire on Friday following a collision with a bike at Chinna Tekuru village in Andhra Pradesh's Kurnool district.

Noted human rights advocate and philanthropist George Soros has received the European Civil Rights Prize of the Sinti and Roma for his many years of work supporting Roma communities across Europe.The prize, awarded at a ceremony in Berlin where former chancellor Angela Merkel was a speaker, was accepted on his behalf by George Soros' son, Alex, who is the chair of the board of directors of the Open Society foundations founded by his father.The prize comes with an endowment of €15,000 (around $17,400).A press release issued by the Open Society foundations said George Soros was awarded the prize for supporting ""Roma-led organisations to confront discrimination, expand access to education and justice, improve early childhood development and health care and amplify Roma voices in public life.""Soros himself said in a statement that ""[t]he Roma have endured centuries of discrimination and marginalisation, rooted in a long history of violence, from the Holocaust to forced sterilisation, child removals, and evictions.""""These injustices continue to resurface, as seen during the Covid-19 pandemic and, more recently, when Roma fleeing the war in Ukraine faced barriers to shelter and aid,"" he wrote. ""I've always believed that open societies must protect the rights of all people, especially those who are excluded.Working alongside Roma leaders and communities has been one of the most meaningful parts of my life’s work.""According to the press release, he has said he will donate the prize money to the Roma education fund, which provides Roma communities with access to skills and employment programs and education.Previous winners of the prize include Simone Veil, the former president of the European parliament, the former council of Europe commissioner for human rights, Thomas Hammarberg and Merkel, among others.The Sinti and Roma people trace their roots back to the northern Indian subcontinent and had arrived in Europe by the 15th Century.The term ""Sinti"" specifically refers to communities traditionally inhabiting Central Europe, including Germany, while ""Roma"" and ""Romani"" are used as broader umbrella terms.The ethnic minority group was subjected to systemic extermination under Germany's Nazi regime, it is estimated that up to 500,000 Sinti and Roma were murdered by the Nazis and their allies by the end of World War II Today, some 80,000-140,000 Sinti and Roma live in Germany, while they number around 10-12 million in Europe in total.Sinti and Roma people are still subject to considerable discrimination and prejudice. Last year, German authorities reported that there had been a significant increase in anti-ziganist incidents in 2024.","The prize comes with an endowment of €15,000 (around $17,400) The Sinti and Roma people trace their roots back to the northern Indian subcontinent and arrived in Europe by the 15th Century.

'Won't Rely On America': Canada's Big Message To Trump As Tariffs Strain Bilateral Ties





US President Donald Trump announced late Thursday that he is halting “all trade negotiations” with Canada, citing recent television ads protesting US tariffs as “egregious behavior” intended to influence American court decisions.“The Ronald Reagan Foundation has just announced that Canada has fraudulently used an advertisement, which is FAKE, featuring Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about Tariffs,” Trump said through a post on Truth Social.“Based on their egregious behavior, ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED,” Trump added.Earlier this week, Trump said he had seen the ad on television and interpreted it as evidence that his tariffs were making an impact.The move follows remarks from Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who said he plans to double Canada’s exports to markets outside the US in response to the threat posed by Trump’s tariffs.The advertisement, launched by Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s government for $75 million highlights former President Ronald Reagan’s warning about the harm of tariffs.The 60-second TV spot features workers, such as welders and bakers, as well as families, while using Reagan’s 1987 radio address, in which he stated that trade barriers hurt all American workers and consumers, as cited by the Globe and Mail.“High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars,” Reagan says.“Then the worst happens. Markets shrink and collapse, businesses and industries shut down, and millions of people lose their jobs. Throughout the world, there’s a growing realization that the way to prosperity for all nations is rejecting protectionist legislation and promoting fair and free competition,” Reagan says in the advertisement.Ford revealed the $ 75 million price tag for the ads during a speech earlier this month at the Empire Club of Canada luncheon in downtown Toronto. He added that the province plans to deliver the message “to every Republican district” across the United States.“We’re just going to speak the truth,” Ford said. “That ad, it’s not a nasty ad. It’s actually just very factual. Coming from a person like Ronald Reagan, every Republican is going to identify that voice.”The Ronald Reagan Foundation dismissed the ad as a ""misrepresentation"" and said it is reviewing legal options to challenge its use.“The ad misrepresents the Presidential Radio Address, and the Government of Ontario did not seek nor receive permission to use and edit the remarks. The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute is reviewing its legal option in this matter,” the Foundation said through a post on X.","US President Donald Trump announced late Thursday that he is halting “all trade negotiations” with Canada.

What did Orban tell his supporters?



Orban attempts to frame opponents as clueless warmongers



What did Magyar say to his supporters?







Tens of thousands of Hungarians marched through the streets of Budapest on Thursday as rival political rallies were staged in the capital, marking Memorial Day for the Revolution of 1956, the anniversary of the country's failed uprising against the Soviet Union.It coincides with campaign season ahead of an April ballot that could see the prime minister face the biggest electoral challenge of his career.The rallies are seen as a barometer of support for Prime Minister Viktor Orban, the longest serving leader in the EU, and challenger Peter Magyar and his Tisza party, with both running neck-and-neck in the polls six-months out from a general election.Prime Minister Orban's self-labeled ""peace march"" got under way first, with his supporters marching under a banner reading, ""We don't want to die for Ukraine.""Supporters of Orban's pro-EU political rival Peter Magyar marched under a banner demanding ""system change"" in what he and his center-right Tisza party dubbed a ""national rally.""Viktor Orban, a nationalist, has led Hungary for 15 years as a far-right populist with increasingly strained ties to the EU but ever-friendlier relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin . He is also a friend of US President Donald Trump Peter Magyar, a 44-year-old former lawyer and ex-Fidesz insider turned EU parliamentarian, has ridden a wave of economic and political dissatisfaction to become Orban's main challenger after publicly breaking with him and his party in February 2024.Addressing supporters at Parliament Square, Orban, a fierce critic of most things EU and Ukraine, accused Brussels of sabotaging President Trump's efforts to end the war there.""Brussels has decided to go to war. If Brussels did not hinder the US president's peace mission, the war would already be over,"" Orban told his flag-waving crowd.Orban has repeatedly infuriated both the EU and fellow European leaders by opposing military aid to Ukraine and vehemently attacking the idea of EU and Nato membership for Kyiv while at the same time maintaining close ties with the Kremlin despite concerted EU efforts to isolate Moscow over its invasion of neighboring Ukraine.Orban and his Fidesz party argue that Hungary's sovereignty is not threatened by Russia today but ""the imperial aspirations of the European Union .""The prime minister is expected to travel to Brussels later Thursday for an EU summit on support for Kyiv.Despite the tight political race right now, things had been looking up for Orban last week when Trump and Putin announced that peace talks would soon be held in Budapest, much to the consternation of Kyiv for historical reasons as well as over Orban's involvement in any negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, before canceling them.Political observers see focus on the war as advantageous to Orban, who is pitching himself and his supporters as ""pacifists"" and Brussels, Tisza and anyone who supports Ukraine as ""warmongers.""Orban, who labeled the opposition rally a ""Brussels war march,"" turned his rhetoric toward Magyar and Tisza in his remarks, saying, ""Those who believe they are supporting a change of government are in fact supporting war, whether they realize it or not.""Later on Thursday, Magyar waved a Hungarian flag as he addressed thousands of his own supporters at Heroes' Square.After marching through the streets of Budapest chanting ""Russians go home,"" referencing both 1956 and the perceived surge in Russian influence over Hungary's politics today, Magyar's supporters, cheered him, shouting ""We've had enough.""Magyar used the historical significance of the day to highlight Orban's dramatic shift in stance over the years by taking supporters back to 1989, when Orban demanded Soviet troops get out of Hungary.""That politician who demanded Russian troops should leave Hungary, now is the most loyal ally of the Kremlin,"" said Magyar. ""He built a system in which power is centralized, the press is under control... and the country is ruled by fear.""Magyar is running as an anti-corruption candidate and rails against Orban's leadership, pointing out that under him Hungary has become the EU's poorest and most corrupt member state.Magyar has increasingly taken his message to rural voters, recently completing an 80-day open forum discussion tour of the nation. His push is a direct threat to Fidesz, which draws most of its support from rural voters.","Hungary marks Memorial Day for the Revolution of 1956, the anniversary of the country's failed uprising against the Soviet Union.

'Don't Poke The Bear': Putin FIRES At Trump's Sanctions, EU Toilet Ban; Shoots Russian Oil Warning





US President Donald Trump on Thursday responded to Russian President Vladimir Putin ’s claim that US sanctions would not impact Russia’s economy.Trump said he was “glad” that Putin held such a view but suggested that the true effects would become clear over time.""I am glad he feels that way. I'll let you know about it in six months from now. Let's see how it all works out..."" Trump told reporters.The United States on Wednesday imposed sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. In response, Moscow condemned the move as “unfriendly,” warning that such measures would do little to improve already strained relations with Washington.Putin acknowledged that the latest sanctions under Trump were “serious” and would have “certain consequences” for Russia, yet maintained that the country’s economy remained resilient and self-sufficient, downplaying the overall impact of Western restrictions.“They (sanctions) are serious for us, of course, that is clear. And they will have certain consequences, but they will not significantly impact our economic well-being,” Putin told reporters. He described the sanctions as an “unfriendly act” that “does not strengthen Russia-US relations, which have only just begun to recover,"" Putin said.“This is, of course, an attempt to put pressure on Russia,” Putin said. “But no self-respecting country and no self-respecting people ever decides anything under pressure.”However, Putin emphasized that Moscow and Washington “have many areas in which they could cooperate,” provided both sides move away from “pressure tactics” and engage in “serious conversations about the long term.” US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the sanctions were intended to cut off “the Kremlin’s war machine” and urged US allies to take similar action. “We encourage our partners to join us and adhere to these sanctions,” he said.Speaking shortly after the announcement, President Trump said that the measures would encourage dialogue between Moscow and Kyiv. “Hopefully he’ll become reasonable,” Trump said of Putin. “And hopefully Zelenskyy will be reasonable, too. You know, it takes two to tango, as they say.”The sanctions freeze all US-based assets of both Rosneft and Lukoil and bar American citizens and entities from conducting business with them.","Putin acknowledged that the latest sanctions under Trump were “serious” and would have “certain consequences” for Russia.

Louvre thieves reportedly bungled initial attempt to open display case



Gaps in CCTV coverage of Louvre's outer walls







The thieves who snatched millions of dollars' worth of jewelry in a daring daylight heist at the Louvre museum on Sunday left behind numerous DNA samples.Investigators found ""more than 150 DNA, fingerprint and other traces"" at the scene, Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau told French news site Ouest-France on Thursday.These came from a helmet, angle grinders, gloves, a vest and other items used and abandoned by the four burglars, Beccuau said.""The analyses take time, even though they are a priority for the labs. We are expecting results in the next few days, which may provide us with leads, particularly if the perpetrators were on file,"" she said.The hooded and masked thieves clambered up an extendable ladder onto a Louvre balcony on Sunday and broke into the first-floor Apollo Gallery, home to France's remaining crown jewels.They made away with eight pieces of jewellery once owned by French queens and empresses worth an estimated €88 million ($102 million).But the thieves initially failed to open the jewelry display cases with angle grinders, Le Parisien news site reported on Wednesday, citing museum surveillance footage.The perpetrators finally managed to break small openings in the cases with other tools and pull out the jewelry by hand, the paper said.According to Le Parisien, the CCTV footage also shows that the internal alarm systems worked perfectly and immediately.The first alarm went off at 9.34am (0734 GMT) on Sunday when the burglars used a power tool to destroy the window of the balcony door.Two museum employees tried to chase away the burglars before they could break open the display cases, the footage shows, Le Parisien said. But the footage shows the staff retreating, possibly out of fear that the burglars were armed.The Louvre's director, Laurence des Cars, on Wednesday admitted that the thieves had taken advantage of a blind spot in the security surveillance to scale the museum's outside walls.Speaking to the French Senate, des Cars said she would push for a police station to be set up inside the Louvre and restrict parking around the Louvre to stop vehicles parking directly next to the museum.She also pledged to upgrade the CCTV network of the world's most visited museum.Despite the CCTV failings at the museum, prosecutor Beccuau noted on Thursday that public and private security cameras elsewhere had allowed detectives to track the thieves ""in Paris and in surrounding regions.""She said she hoped that, with all the media attention on the robbery, ""the robbers will not really dare move with the jewels."" ""I want to be optimistic,"" she said.","Louvre thieves reportedly bungled initial attempt to open display case with angle grinders.

What to expect in Trump-Xi meeting

US-China ties





US President Donald Trump will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on October 30, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in South Korea, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Thursday, reaffirming the meeting that had been questioned following an escalation in trade tensions.Leavitt informed reporters that Trump departs for Malaysia late on Friday night and will also visit Japan and South Korea. In South Korea, he is scheduled to meet Xi next Thursday after addressing the APEC CEO Summit.""On Thursday morning local time, President Trump will participate in a bilateral meeting with President Xi of the People's Republic of China, before departing to return home,"" Leavitt said.Trump on Thursday (local time) took a tough stance on China's alleged role in smuggling fentanyl into the US via Venezuela.He accused China of using Venezuela as a transit point for fentanyl, evading US and Mexican port controls. Trump, during a press interaction at the White House, stated that the first question he would ask the Chinese leader would be about fentanyl.""I'm meeting with President Xi... The first question I'm going to be asking him about is fentanyl. They make $100 million selling fentanyl into our country. They lose $100 billion with the 20% tariff.So it's not a good business proposition... It's one of the things we're talking about... They pay a very big penalty for doing that... We'll see what happens at the end of next week... I'm meeting with President Xi, actually, in South Korea. ..,"" said Trump.There is a lot at stake, so pressure is building on both leaders Trump and Xi to calm trade tensions that risk damaging the world’s two biggest economies.In this meeting, Trump is expected to crack a deal with Xi as he recently offered to lower tariffs on Chinese exports to the US but insisted that Beijing, too, had to make concessions, including resuming purchases of US soya beans, curbing the flow of ingredients used to make the opioid fentanyl – which has caused an overdose epidemic in America – and lifting restrictions on the export to the US of rare earth minerals, which are needed to manufacture hi-tech products such as smartphones, Guardian reported.Rare-earth stocks continue to be at the top of investors’ minds as the market weighs potential outcomes of a meeting between the leaders of the world’s two largest economies.A failure to reduce trade tensions could further harm US industries that are already grappling with the impact of Trump’s tariffs.The President was optimistic ahead of his meeting with Xi, telling reporters this week: “I think we’re going to end up having a fantastic deal with China … it’s going to be fantastic for the entire world”.Time is of the essence, however, as Trump and Xi’s meeting, yet to be confirmed by Beijing, is scheduled to occur just as additional duties of 100% on Chinese exports to the US are set to take effect.The leaders are also expected to discuss Taiwan, amid concerns that Trump might hesitate in Washington’s support for the democratic, self-governing island under pressure from Xi.Beijing has reportedly requested the White House to declare opposition to Taiwan independence – a move that would please China, which considers Taiwan a renegade province that must be reunified with the mainland.Trade tensions between the United States and China intensified in recent weeks following President Trump's announcement of 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese exports, set to take effect two days after the leaders meet.Trump's pledge followed China's announcement of newly imposed export controls on rare earth metals and related technologies in electronics and military goods.The new US tariffs would be “over and above any tariff” that China is already paying, Trump wrote in a social media post earlier this month. Trump added on Wednesday that his priority is to end Russia's war in Ukraine.Xi “would now like to see that war end,” the president said. It will be the first in-person meeting between the leaders since 2019, when the two met in Japan at the G20 summit, as per Politico.","US President Donald Trump will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on October 30, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in South Korea.

Political ambitions







Guayaquil: Car bombings, massacres, extortion , and a security force outgunned by drug gangs: the mayor of Ecuador's most violent city says residents are living through a ""collective psychosis"" and suggests the president's hardline policies bear some of the blame.Aquiles Alvarez, 41, runs Guayaquil, a port city of nearly three million people, while wearing sneakers and an electronic ankle bracelet.Prosecutors are investigating him for alleged fuel smuggling, a charge he denies.In an interview with AFP, Alvarez accused President Daniel Noboa of failing to contain the bloodshed that has turned Ecuador into one of Latin America's most dangerous countries.""They are the ones who control the monopoly of force and manage the country's security,"" he said, referring to the national government, which oversees the police and the military.Guayaquil recorded 1,900 murders between January and September, the highest toll in Ecuador.""People live under stress,"" Alvarez said. Last week alone, there were seven bomb alerts - all false.""They leave backpacks with dirty clothes inside and people panic, thinking they are bombs,"" he explained from a municipal office.The violence, he said, has created a ""collective psychosis.""Ecuador, once one of Latin America's safest countries, has become a key cocaine transit hub between top producers Colombia and Peru, and consumers around the world.Mexican cartels have forged alliances with local gangs like Los Choneros and Los Lobos, who battle over control of ports and shipping routes.Murder rates have soared, while car bombings, assassinations and prison massacres have become routine.And Guayaquil, known locally as the Pearl of the Pacific, is clearly a city on edge.Poor neighborhoods are under the thumb of organised crime, which has set up drug warehouses, armed patrols, and even hitman schools, according to authorities.In wealthier districts, private guards protect residents behind high walls.Noboa, 37, has responded with hardline security policies, deploying soldiers to the streets in an unprecedented show of force.Alvarez disagrees with that strategy.""We believe you don't fight crime with more guns, vests, helmets, and bullets, but with public policies focused on preventing violence to reduce crime,"" said the evangelical father of three.He may have political reasons for attacking Noboa, whom he accuses of ""political persecution.""Alvarez won the mayor's office in 2023 with backing from the party of former socialist president Rafael Correa, though he insists he is not part of Correa's movement.He praises the ex-leader, but says he has his own style.Correa banned foreign military bases during his decade in power; now, Noboa wants to bring them back through a referendum.Alvarez takes a pragmatic view.""All help is welcome for me,"" he said.""If they want to contribute with military bases in strategic points of the country, they are welcome to, but it must be coordinated with the armed forces and never at the cost of sovereignty.""Alvarez, who holds Ecuadoran and Spanish nationality, once delivered pizzas in the United States and later was the manager of Barcelona de Ecuador, the country's most popular football club.He jokes about being called an opposition figure but does not rule out a presidential run, if he can end his legal troubles.""They want to convict me so that in October 2026, when it's time to register for re-election or any other candidacy, I'm disqualified,"" he claimed.","Aquiles Alvarez, 41, runs Guayaquil, a port city of nearly three million people, while wearing sneakers and an electronic ankle bracelet.

Two B-1 bombers took off from Dyess Air Force Base in Texas on Thursday morning, reportedly en route to Venezuela; however, US President Donald Trump dismissed the report, calling it “not accurate.”The bomber flight report, firstly published by the Wall Street Journal, came amid Washington's military campaign against alleged drug traffickers in the region, leading to fears in Caracas that the ultimate aim is regime change.Data from the tracking website Flightradar24 indicated that a B-1B advanced toward the Venezuelan coast on Thursday afternoon before executing a U-turn and heading north, after which it vanished from view.When questioned during a White House event about reports of the US sending B-1Bs near Venezuela, Trump stated that ""it's false,"" adding that the United States is ""not happy with Venezuela for a lot of reasons.""This latest flight follows a week after US-based B-52 bombers circled off Venezuela's coast for several hours.The US military described that mission as a demonstration of Washington's commitment ""to proactively deter adversary threats, enhance crew training, and ensure the global force readiness necessary to respond to any contingency or challenge.""As part of its counter-narcotics efforts, the United States has deployed stealth warplanes and Navy ships but has yet to provide evidence that its targets—eight boats and a semi-submersible—were involved in drug smuggling.The US strikes, which commenced on September 2, have resulted in the deaths of at least 37 people, according to an AFP tally based on US figures.Regional tensions have escalated due to the campaign, with Venezuela accusing the United States of attempting to overthrow President Nicolas Maduro, who stated on Wednesday that his country possesses 5,000 Russian man-portable surface-to-air missiles to counter US forces.","Two B-1 bombers took off from Dyess Air Force Base in Texas on Thursday morning, reportedly en route to Venezuela.

A US official has warned that President Donald Trump could take severe action against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he undermines the Gaza ceasefire deal, according to a report by Times of Israel citing Channel 12.Correspondent Barak Ravid, speaking in Hebrew on the network, said that a US official told him, “Netanyahu is walking a fine line with President Trump. If he keeps going, he’ll f**k up the Gaza deal. And if he f**ks up the deal, Donald Trump will f**k him.”“In English, it sounds even cruder,” news anchor Yonit Levi noted at the end of Ravid’s report.This remarks showed a growing frustration in Washington with recent moves of Israel particularly, the Knesset’s vote yesterday to advance two bills to annex parts of the West Bank which reportedly stunned US officials.The source told Ravid that US Vice President JD Vance, who was visiting Israel at the time, was shocked by the decision and believes that Israel is acting in an “unsupervised” manner.Netanyahu updated Vance about the Knesset vote during the vice president’s visit, assuring him that it was merely a “preliminary vote” and would “go nowhere,” the public broadcaster Kan reported.Vance responded, “This cannot happen while I am visiting here.”According to the Channel 12 report, Netanyahu had been warned by American officials that the vote could provoke a backlash and destabilise ongoing negotiations over the ceasefire.Vice President Vance on Wednesday urged Netanyahu to ""give a shot"" to the Gaza ceasefire deal and help implement it, two US officials and one Israeli official familiar with the meeting told Axios.Vance met with Netanyahu in Jerusalem as an air train of US officials began arriving in Israel to work on stabilising the fragile ceasefire, the Trump administration's biggest diplomatic breakthrough so far.","A US official has warned that President Donald Trump could take severe action against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he undermines the Gaza ceasefire deal.

Many US presidents have undertaken upgrades to the White House, but Trump's ballroom is the largest in more than a century.The sweeping demolition, far more drastic than initially promised by President Donald Trump, has left Washington stunned.When Trump first announced his grand plan in July, he assured Americans that the new 90,000-square-foot ballroom would sit “near” the main building, “but not touching it.”Now, he’s taken a different tune. After “consulting architects,” Trump declared that “really knocking it down” made more sense than a partial teardown.The new 1,000-seat ballroom—intended to host state dinners and events that currently take place under temporary tents—has ballooned in cost, too. The White House first pegged it at $200 million, then $250 million, and now Trump says $300 million.But don’t worry, says Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt: “It’s not going to cost the taxpayers a dime.”","Satellite images show that the area that once served as the office of the First Lady has now been turned into rubble.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Thursday (local time) reacted to the California crash caused by Indian-origin truck driver Jashanpreet Singh that killed three people.

A 21-year-old illegal migrant from India is accused of causing a horrific pile-up on a California freeway that left three people dead and several others injured earlier this week, federal immigration officials said.Jashanpreet Singh allegedly crashed his 18-wheeler semi-truck into slow-moving traffic on the I-10 Freeway in San Bernardino County on Tuesday while under the influence of drugs, according to police.Dashcam footage captured the moment Singh’s truck slammed into the back of an SUV before hitting multiple other vehicles. The truck also appeared to strike another semi before coming to a stop on the side of the road.Singh was arrested on suspicion of gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated, and on charges of driving under the influence. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has lodged an arrest detainer, requesting that local authorities notify the federal agency before Singh is released.“It is a terrible tragedy three innocent people lost their lives due to the reckless open border policies that allowed an illegal alien to be released into the US and drive an 18-wheeler on America’s highways,” said homeland security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin.Police said Singh never applied the brakes before hitting the traffic jam, with toxicology tests confirming he was impaired at the time. Singh is believed to have entered the United States in 2022 via the southern border and was later released into the country under the Biden administration, officials said.The crash forced the closure of all westbound lanes for several hours while investigators examined the scene. Wreckage of two crushed cars, one red and one black, lay beside Singh’s truck as authorities worked to clear the highway. At least four other people were injured in the collision.“This accident follows a disturbing trend of illegal aliens driving 18-wheelers and semi-trucks on America’s roads,” McLaughlin added. “Earlier this week, DHS highlighted another fatal accident in Indiana caused by an illegal alien driving a semi-truck. Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, ICE is working day-in and day-out to make America’s roads safe again.”","Jashanpreet Singh, 21, allegedly crashed his 18-wheeler semi-truck into slow- moving traffic on the I-10 Freeway in San Bernardino County on Tuesday.

New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani once again came under fire, this time from comedian and podcaster Michael Rapaport , who took aim at him for eating at one of Manhattan’s priciest sushi restaurants, questioning the socialist’s “working class” image.Rapaport posted a photo of Mamdani dining at Omen Azen on Wednesday. The restaurant features items such as a $27 kampai caviar appetizer and a 12-piece sashimi combo for $50, according to the New York Post.During a debate last week, Mamdani said he spends $125-$150 per week on groceries. Omen Azen’s nine-course seasonal tasting menu costs $145, featuring filet mignon, burdock soup, and sashimi.“How’s a ‘working class’ mayoral candidate like Zohran Mamdani eating at OMEN SUSHI — one of the most expensive spots in NYC?” Rapaport asked on X.He added, “The rent-stabilized ‘man of the people’ from Queens is out here dining like a diplomat on a Qatari stipend. Who’s picking up the check, Zoron the Moron? You’re not working class — you’re fraud class.”Mamdani is a state assembly member from Queens. The frontrunner was born in Uganda and has campaigned on affordability issues, including rent freezes, free bus fares, city-run grocery stores, taxing the rich and universal childcare.Rapaport also mocked Mamdani’s transport choices, posting on Instagram, “Also do you think he took the train, bus, or an UBER back to his rent stabilized apartment in Queens?” He added that he would support Mamdani’s election rival, former governor Andrew Cuomo, who called Mamdani a “child of wealth.”“He grew up in Uganda — basically in a palace. Moved to Manhattan, grew up in a West Side penthouse, went to private school, $60,000 a year and Bowdoin College,” Cuomo said on YouTuber and influencer Logan Paul’s Impaulsive podcast.Rapaport discussed Mamdani’s family background as well. Mamdani’s mother, acclaimed filmmaker Mira Nair, has had projects funded by Qatari state cultural institutions. Rapaport reposted a menu photo from Omen Sushi with the caption, “Fun fact: 12 pieces of sushi are $50 at Omen... Mamdani is a typical ‘money for me, not for thee’ parasitic socialist.”In response to criticism of his own comments, Rapaport wrote on X, “This offends you — but a mayoral candidate of NYC declaring there’s a genocide going on with 0.0 evidence, refusing to condemn ‘Globalize the Intifada,’ and stacking up dozens of false promises doesn’t offend you?!”",New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani once again came under fire.

Massive Violence Erupts In Pakistan After TLP’s Pro-Palestine March Turns Ugly





Pakistan’s cabinet on Thursday approved a proposal to ban the extremist Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) party under the country's Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) after it recently staged violent protests in the country.The decision was taken at a cabinet meeting chaired by Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, which discussed the Punjab government’s request to outlaw the religious group under the ATA of 1997, news agency PTI reported.The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said in a statement that the cabinet ""unanimously"" approved the ban. As per the PTI report, Pakistan's interior ministry presented a summary of the Punjab government’s request and briefed the meeting on the ""violent and terrorist activities of TLP in the country.""""The meeting was informed that this organisation, established in 2016, has incited violence across the country. Due to the organisation, incidents of violence have occurred in different parts of the country,"" the statement added.The PMO noted that the TLP was banned in 2021, but the ban was lifted after six months on the condition that the party would not carry out unrest or violent activities. The current ban was also justified by the group reneging on the guarantees given in 2021.""In the past, security personnel and innocent bystanders have been killed in violent protests and rallies by the TLP. The federal cabinet, after a briefing given to the meeting and the recommendation of the Punjab government, unanimously concluded that the TLP is involved in terrorism and violent acts,"" the statement said, as cited by PTI.After the ban, the TLP will be added to the list of proscribed groups maintained by the Pakistan's National Counter Terrorism Authority (NACTA), which already includes militant groups such as Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), Lashkar-e-Toiba, and extremist organisations like Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and Jaish-e-Mohammed.Before the listing, the federal government must refer the matter to the Pakistan Supreme Court within 15 days for approval. Once confirmed by the court, which has the final authority to ban a political party, the TLP will be officially added to the list of proscribed organisations.Earlier, the Pakistan's Punjab government had decided to ban the TLP in a meeting chaired by chief minister Maryam Nawaz on October 16, five days after the party began a protest march in Lahore. The TLP had launched a ""Gaza solidarity"" march on October 11, aiming to reach Islamabad and protest outside the US embassy. The march was halted at Muridke, around 60 km from Lahore, and dispersed on October 13.Clashes between police and TLP supporters at Muridke left around 16 people, including policemen, dead and over 1,600 injured. The TLP has a history of violent protests since 2017, when it staged a major protest and laid siege to Islamabad.Pakistan’s anti-cybercrime agency also arrested over 100 social media activists of the TLP for inflammatory posts. ""We have arrested 107 social media activists (of TLP) for inflammatory posts besides blocking 75 such accounts,"" Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said at a press conference.Punjab police said they have arrested over 6,000 TLP activists following last week’s clashes. The government has sealed 61 seminaries run by the party and handed control of TLP mosques and seminaries to the Auqaf Department.","Pakistan's cabinet approved a proposal to ban the extremist Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) party under the country's Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) The decision was taken at a cabinet meeting chaired by Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
