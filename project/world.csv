It is important that we rise above party politics and undertake concrete measures nationwide,"" the Prez said amid opposition MPs shouting ""NEET-NEET"".The mention of NEET came amid indications that the opposition may dial up the pressure on the govt in Parliament on Friday through an adjournment motion to seek an immediate discussion by suspending the debate on the motion of thanks on the Prez's address.Govt has said that it was not running away from a discussion but whether it would agree to a full-scale debate on the exam controversy immediately, by allowing it to be raised during the debate on the motion of thanks, remains to be seen.In any case, while it views the issue as serious, it will not allow itself to be painted into a corner. The intent came across clearly in the President's address, with Murmu saying that there have been such incidents in the past too and, besides, have been reported from states. She urged members to rise above politics and contribute in evolving concrete measures.The comments came amid the probe by CBI and state police and education minister Dharmendra Pradhan setting up a panel to review the entire system, including the functioning of National Testing Agency , whose chief was shunted out after several irregularities and gaps came to light. Besides, Murmu pointed to the recently notified law against those undertaking unfair means or those offering assistance.The address also gave a strong vote of confidence for EVMs, on which the opposition repeatedly raised doubts during the poll campaign.

As the United States presidential election draws closer, Joe Biden and Donald Trump are gearing up for the first of two pivotal debates that have the potential to alter the course of the race.The event, which will be televised, is anticipated to attract a huge viewership and will probably witness an escalation in the increasingly personal attacks between the two campaigns.In the days leading up to this momentous debate between two former White House occupants, both Trump and Biden have experienced instances that have raised questions about their age, such as occasional verbal missteps or seeming disoriented.The debate will start at 9 pm ET (Friday, June 28, 6:30 am IST). It's being moderated by CNN's Jake Tapper and Dana Bash.The debate will be broadcast live on CNN's main network, as well as on CNN International, CNN en Español, and CNN Max. Viewers can also watch the event live on CNN's website without the need to log in. Several other networks have also agreed to carry the debate live.The setting for the first general election debate is CNN's studios in Atlanta. Unlike the Republican primary debates, no audience will be present.Trump didn't take part in any of the GOP primary debates, so this is his first time on stage this cycle. Biden didn't debate any of the Democrats challenging him, either.","The debate will start at 9 pm ET (Friday, June 28, 6:30 am IST) It's being moderated by CNN's Jake Tapper and Dana Bash.

New York primary election 2024: All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-york-primary-election-2024-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/111273943.cms,"Former CNN personality John Avlon wins Democratic primary in New York

US rep Lauren Boebert wins republican house primary

Polls closed at 9 pm (US time)

What next?

NEW DELHI: George Latimer , a Democratic Party politician , and a pro-Israel centrist , defeated US Representative Jamaal Bowman on Tuesday (local time) in a New York Congressional district election.Latimer successfully defeated one of the progressive members of Congress, who was also known for being a vocal critic of Israel's policies. Bowman had previously leveled accusations against Israel, claiming that the country had perpetrated genocide in Gaza, a region where a significant number of Palestinians have lost their lives due to military actions.Latimer, a former state legislator who has held the position of Westchester County executive since 2018, entered the race after being encouraged by Jewish community leaders.His campaign received substantial financial support from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a prominent pro-Israel lobbying organization.In the previous year, the US Congress took the step of officially reprimanding Bowman for his actions during a congressional session. While Democrats were attempting to delay a vote to prevent a government shutdown, Bowman set off a fire alarm, causing an evacuation of the building, BBC reported.The primary race saw Latimer receiving support from Hillary Clinton, the former Secretary of State. On the other hand, Bowman had the backing of prominent figures such as Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a well-known left-wing representative, and Bernie Sanders, an independent senator from Vermont.In other notable congressional contests, John Avlon, a former CNN political analyst, has won the Democratic primary race in New York's 1st Congressional District and defeated challenging Nancy Goroff, who has lived in Suffolk County for more than two decades.Avlon will now face Rep. Nick LaLota, the Republican incumbent, in November. While President Joe Biden eked out a 0.2-point win in the district in 2020, LaLota cruised to an 11-point victory two years later. The Democratic House Majority PAC has characterized the 1st Congressional District as ""one of the most competitive districts in the country,"" while the Cook Political Report has called it ""likely Republican.""US rep Lauren Boebert won the republican primary in a US house race that she jumped into last year, surviving a scandal over a video of her at a Denver theater and accusations of carpetbagging after fleeing what could have been a tough reelection bid in her current district.Boebert built national hard-line conservative stardom through a take-no-prisoners political style in the House.That clout likely made it easier for her to weather the scandals of the last year, which included the video of her vaping and causing a disturbance at a musical production of ""Beetlejuice.""Boebert beat a group of homegrown primary candidates who had far less name recognition and generally less combative political styles.Meanwhile, in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, state Rep. Stefani Zinerman faces a challenge from Eon Huntley, who is supported by the Democratic Socialists of America.In the Hudson Valley, state Rep. Didi Barrett is being challenged by Claire Cousin, who has questioned Barrett's record on environmental issues and emphasized the need for more affordable housing. Lastly, in East Harlem, state Rep. Eddie Gibbs is facing Xavier Santiago in a race that has turned into a debate over representation and has seen personal insults exchanged between the candidates.Polls will close at 9 pm Tuesday. Voters can find their local polling places on the Board of Elections website.New York is a closed primary state, meaning Democrats and Republicans can vote only in their own parties' primaries. Unaffiliated or independent voters cannot participate in the primary. The last day to register to vote before the primaries was June 15, and early voting ended Sunday.All absentee ballots must be dropped off at a polling place by 9 pm or postmarked June 25.The winner will face a challenging battle against the Republican incumbent in November.The Democratic-led state Legislature is also up for election in November, with several Assembly primary races expected to be closely contested. These races highlight the ongoing divide between institutional and progressive Democrats within the party, particularly on issues such as housing and criminal justice.(With inputs from agencies)",Former CNN personality John Avlon wins Democratic primary in New York's 1st Congressional District.

North Korea to send troops to support Russia in conflict with Ukraine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/north-korea-to-send-troops-to-support-russia-in-conflict-with-ukraine/articleshow/111321851.cms,"Last week, President Vladimir Putin made an official state visit to North Korea , his first in nearly 25 years. During the visit, Putin and Kim Jong Un signed a defense pact in Pyongyang on June 19. The military treaty states: ""In the event that any one of the two sides is put in a state of war by an armed invasion from an individual state or several states, the other side shall provide military and other assistance with all means in its possession without delay.""Following the agreement, North Korea announced that it will send a military engineering unit to support Russian forces in the Donetsk region, with troops expected to arrive as early as next month, Kyiv Post reported.Since the leaders met in Russia in September, the DPRK has already provided Russia with nearly two million rounds of artillery ammunition, rockets for multiple launch rocket systems, and allegedly ballistic missiles. The involvement of North Korean combat troops raises concerns about the conflict 's escalation, particularly as experts believe the deployment may not fare well for Pyongyang's sappers.Pentagon spokesperson Pat Ryder questioned the wisdom of the deployment during a briefing on June 25, stating that North Korean troops were being sent to their slaughter in an illegal war against Ukraine. He said, “I think that if I were North Korean military personnel management, I would be questioning my choices on sending my forces to be cannon fodder in an illegal war against Ukraine – we’ve seen the kinds of casualties that Russian forces [have been taking].”He also mentioned that the US was monitoring the deepening military ties between the two countries.",Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un signed a defense pact in Pyongyang on June 19.

"Washington DC of today too hot for Lincoln: Wax statue melts, turns into a meme",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/washington-dc-of-today-too-hot-for-lincoln-wax-statue-melts-turns-into-a-meme/articleshow/111322822.cms,"What do you call a wax replica of a former president during an oppressive heatwave? A punchline waiting to happen. Originally installed at an elementary school in Washington, D.C., in Feb, the 6-foot wax version of the Lincoln Memorial was intended as a commentary on American monument culture.Instead, it became a meme.As temperatures in the region neared triple digits over the weekend, the replica's head mostly melted off, turning the towering president into a droopy mess.People sharing the photos online could relate. To them, Abraham Lincoln looked as if he were reacting to an annoying work email or sinking into a couch after a long day. Jokes and innuendo abounded about why he was leaning back.The work's sculptor, Sandy Williams IV , said the online conversation highlighted something special about public art: It is open to interpretation, even when that interpretation is unexpected. The sculpture was not supposed to melt in the summer heat. Wicks are embedded into the wax, and viewers are invited to light one for a few minutes and collectively melt Lincoln over time. Williams said they used paraffin wax graded to withstand up to 140F. Temperatures in the region did not reach those heights, but they did set records. On Saturday, Baltimore's high of 101F broke the record of 100 set in 1988.Because Williams has worked with wax for years, they would often joke that their pieces would eventually need to focus on the environment instead of history. ""I didn't expect that point to be this past weekend,"" Williams said. The work's official title, ""40 ACRES: Camp Barker"", refers to a Civil War-era ""contraband camp"" that was in practice a Union refugee camp for formerly enslaved people. (Garrison Elementary School, where the replica was installed, was once the original site for Camp Barker.) But Williams could not be too upset if the memes enabled more people to see it. ""My hope is with this viral viewing of the work, any segment of the population seeing it will have a moment to spend more time with it and get to know these deeper histories the work is trying to engage,"" he said.","The 6-foot wax version of the Lincoln Memorial was intended as a commentary on American monument culture.

Joe Biden and Donald Trump will clash with each other at the much-awaited first presidential debate on CNN Thursday. This is the first time that there will be no live audience to cheer or boo the speakers. There will also be a mute button -- which was introduced in 2020 from the second debate after Trump and Biden talked over each other in the first debate.CNN's debate night control room will mute the microphones of candidates when it is not their turn to speak.Behind the podiums, there will be two green lights which are a signal that his microphones are on. When the lights are off, the microphone is mute. CNN showed how the mute button will work and how will viewers see it on their screen. When a candidate speaks, the microphone of the other remains off and at that time if the second one interrupts the first one, his voice will not reach the viewers -- he will only be seen miming.But as they are be standing at lecterns that are only 8 feet apart, they will hear each other, even if on mute.In the demo video, CNN reiterated that both the campaign agreed to abide by these rules. ""By agreeing to participate in this debate, both campaigns and candidates have also agreed to abide by these rules,"" CNN said.The 90-minute debate will include two commercial breaks, and campaign staff cannot interact with their candidate during the break, the network said. The second debate between Biden and Trump is slated for September on ABC.CNN moderators Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, already accused by Trump's campaign of spreading fake news against Trump, will use ""all tools at their disposal"" to ensure a civilized discussion.The debate starts at 9 pm and will continue for 90 minutes -- with only two commercial breaks. This is a normal length for a presidential debate, but the commercial breaks are noteworthy: General-election debates in past cycles, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates rather than an individual news organization, did not have them. The candidates will not be allowed to talk to their aides during the commercial breaks, but they will have time to take a breather and collect themselves in a way they would not have in past years.","The first presidential debate will have no live audience to cheer or boo the speakers.

More than 20 countries have now decriminalised or legalised recreational use of marijuana, most in Europe and the Americas.The SC said its guidelines on private use of marijuana will stand until Congress passes legislation.

US Space Command stated that there was no immediate threat to other satellites.The cause of the satellite's break-up is currently unknown, and Russia 's space agency, Roscosmos, has not provided any comments on the incident.LeoLabs, a US space-tracking firm, detected the satellite releasing fragments until 6 pm Mountain Time. US Space Command confirmed that the event generated ""over 100 pieces of trackable debris.""Large debris-generating events in orbit are uncommon but are becoming a growing concern as space becomes increasingly crowded with vital satellite networks. In 2021, Russia faced strong criticism from Western countries when it destroyed one of its defunct satellites using a ground-based anti-satellite (ASAT) missile, creating thousands of pieces of orbital debris. While the RESURS-P1 passed over the Plesetsk rocket site during the initial break-up window, there was no immediate indication that Russia had launched a missile to strike the satellite.When satellites reach the end of their operational life, they either remain in orbit until they eventually descend into Earth's atmosphere and burn up, or they are moved to a ""graveyard orbit"" 36,000 km from Earth to minimize the risk of colliding with active satellites. Roscosmos decommissioned RESURS-P1 in 2021 due to onboard equipment failures and had been lowering its altitude for an eventual atmospheric reentry.The incident highlights the growing need for an international mechanism to manage space traffic and address the risks associated with satellite collisions and space warfare. Space advocates and lawyers have been calling for countries to establish such a system, which does not currently exist, to ensure the safe and sustainable use of space for all."," RESURS-P1 disintegrated on Wednesday, near the International Space Station.

The two men, who make no secret of their disdain for each other, did not shake hands as they walked to their podiums at the start of the debate. Biden frequently referred to Trump as ""this guy"" during his remarks. The current president and his predecessor hadn't spoken since their last debate weeks before the 2020 presidential election.

frequently referred to Trump as ""this guy"" during his remarks. The current president and his predecessor hadn't spoken since their last debate weeks before the 2020 presidential election. Trump skipped Biden's inauguration after leading an unprecedented and unsuccessful effort to overturn his loss that culminated in the January 6 Capitol insurrection by his supporters. Biden, who received the first question, defended rising inflation since taking office, attributing it to the situation he inherited from Trump amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The president cleared his throat twice during his initial response, his voice sounding hoarse, while Trump smirked.

In the opening minutes of the debate, Biden experienced several verbal missteps, struggling with a raspy voice and halting delivery as he attempted to defend his economic record and criticize Trump. The 81-year-old seemed to lose his train of thought while addressing the national debt, referring to ""billionaires"" as ""trillionaires"" before correcting himself. While arguing for increased taxes on the wealthy, Biden paused for an extended, awkward moment, seemingly unable to complete his sentence before ending his thought incoherently.

During a tense exchange on the war in Ukraine, Biden warned that he believes Vladimir Putin is a ""war criminal"" who wants to re-establish part of the ""old Soviet empire"". ""Do you think he wants to stop there [Ukraine]?....what do you think happens to Poland, to Belarus, to those Nato countries?""

is a ""war criminal"" who wants to re-establish part of the ""old Soviet empire"". ""Do you think he wants to stop there [Ukraine]?....what do you think happens to Poland, to Belarus, to those Nato countries?"" Biden also brought up a controversial moment from Trump's presidency, in which he allegedly said that fallen US soldiers were ""losers and suckers"". ""My son was not a loser and not a sucker,"" he said. ""You're the sucker. You're the loser,"" he added, addressing the former president. Trump responded that the quote was ""made up"" and he never said it.

The first presidential debate of the 2024 election season took place, with Joe Biden and his Republican challenger, Donald Trump , facing off in an attempt to persuade undecided voters.For Biden, the 81-year-old Democratic incumbent, the debate provided an opportunity to assure voters of his ability to lead the nation through various challenges. Trump , 78, sought to move past his recent felony conviction in New York and demonstrate to millions of viewers that he possesses the temperament to return to the White House.The Atlanta debate marked several firsts, including the oldest pair of presidential candidates to ever face each other and CNN's inaugural hosting of a general election presidential debate.","The two men, who make no secret of their disdain for each other, did not shake hands as they walked to their podiums at the start of the debate.

Trump's 'if we had a leader' jibe at Biden over Ukraine

In the first mega faceoff ahead of the presidential election, US President Joe Biden took on Republican candidate Donald Trump , who with the same force retorted to Biden's arguments on the range of issues concerning Afghanistan evacuation, illegal immigration, abortion, aides granted to Ukraine and the deadly Israel-Hamas that has terribly rocked Gaza for months now.The heat of rivalry appeared palpable when both candidates on Thursday walked directly to their respective podiums, avoiding a handshake. Unlike the 2020 face-off, the debate took off with fierce salvos, with both the presidential candidates accusing each other of swaying the US off track.In the debate that brought their deep hostility towards each other to the surface, Trump tore into Biden's decision to troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, calling it ""the most embarrassing day in the history of our country's life.""Biden, forced to defend the spiralling inflation since he assumed office, pinned the blame on Trump, claiming that when Trump left the White House ""things were in chaos"". The Republican candidate disagreed saying when the transition of power happened, ""Everything was rocking good"".Biden accused his Republican rival of exaggerating and telling lies about the state of the immigration crisis looming in the US.Biden said the idea that illegal immigrants are being welcomed in the United States is ""simply not true"".""There's no data to support what he said. Once again, he's exaggerating. He's lying,"" Biden said.Attacking Trump for appointing justices to the Supreme Court who ended Roe vs Wade, a decision which allowed abortion rights around the US, Biden said, ""It's been a terrible thing, what you've done.""Referring to women who have been raped, Biden said, ""It's just ridiculous, and they can do nothing about it.""In the vitriolic exchange of words, Biden cited incidents that Trump had described soldiers who died in the Normandy landing as ""suckers"" and noted his own son Beau, who served in Iraq and later died of cancer.""My son was not a loser, was not a sucker. You're the sucker. You're the loser,"" Biden said.Trump denied the remarks and repeatedly accused Biden of not being coherent in his remarks.Biden addressed the Republican rival as a 'convicted felon', referring to charges Trump has been facing including the hush-money case and the confidential document case among others.""The only person on this stage is a convicted felon is the man I'm looking at right now. And the fact of the matter is, what he's telling you is simply not true,"" Biden lashed out at Trump after he said some Democrats should be in prison.Trump did not directly answer if he would support an independent Palestinian state to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, while Biden pitched a plan to end the Gaza war.Biden's part of the plan included trading the hostages in exchange for Palestine prisoners and a continued ""ceasefire with additional conditions"".""The only one who wants the war to continue is Hamas. “We’re still pushing hard to get them to accept,"" Biden said.Republican Donald Trump laid the blame for the Ukraine war on Biden, asserting that the invasion, or special operation as Russia calls would never have happened ""if we had a leader.""""This is a war that never should have started. If we had a leader in this war... He's given $200 billion now or more to Ukraine, he's given $200 billion. That's a lot of money. I don't think there's ever been anything like it,"" Trump said.Both candidates agreed to hold the debate without an audience to avoid the chaos that marred the 2020 matchups. The debate's two commercial breaks offered another departure from modern practice, while the candidates have agreed not to consult staff or others while the cameras are off.Thursday's broadcast on CNN, moderated by anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, marked the earliest presidential debate in history. It was the first-ever televised presidential faceoff hosted by a single news outlet after both campaigns ditched the bipartisan commission on presidential debates, which had organised every matchup since 1988.","US President Joe Biden took on Republican candidate Donald Trump in the first mega faceoff ahead of the presidential election.

EMTALA ensures that patients at hospitals receiving Medicare funding can receive emergency care. Idaho is one of six states with abortion bans that do not include exceptions to safeguard the health of pregnant women.US President Joe Biden praised the decision, stating, ""Today's supreme court order ensures that women in Idaho can access the emergency medical care they need while this case returns to the lower courts.""""No woman should be denied care, made to wait until she's near death, or forced to flee her home state just to receive the health care she needs. This should never happen in America... Yet, this is exactly what is happening in states across the country since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade,"" Biden added, referring to the 2022 decision that reversed the 1973 precedent that had recognized a constitutional right to abortion.However, the supreme court's decision, which was accidentally posted on the court's website on Wednesday, did not resolve the underlying legal dispute. Instead, the court chose to dismiss the case as ""improvidently granted.""Liberal justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, in a separate opinion, agreed with the decision to lift the stay but argued that the case should not have been dismissed, describing the legal situation as a ""fragile detente."" ""This court had a chance to bring clarity and certainty to this tragic situation, and we have squandered it,"" Jackson wrote.Idaho's abortion ""trigger"" law, which was passed in 2020, took effect automatically when Roe was overturned. The law prohibited nearly all abortions, with an exception only to save the mother's life, and imposed severe penalties on doctors who violate it.However, EMTALA requires Medicare-funded hospitals to ""stabilize"" patients with emergency medical conditions, which may necessitate an abortion to prevent serious health risks or organ damage.","The US supreme court issued a ruling on Thursday that allows abortions to proceed in the state of Idaho when pregnant women are experiencing medical emergencies.

However, he has secured relief in other cases, including £190 million reference and Toshakhana, and acquittal in the cypher case, according to Geo News report.Earlier in February, the district court had sentenced the PTI founder and Bushra Bibi each to seven years in prison after the trial court found their nikah to be fraudulent after Bushra Bibi's former husband, Khawar Maneka, approached the court against the couple's marriage.The district court had sentenced the PTI founder and Bushra each, to seven years in prison in February earlier this year after a trial court found their nikah to be fraudulent after Khawar Maneka, Bushra's ex-husband, moved the court against the couple's marriage.Khawar Maneka said that the marriage was solemnized during Bushra Bibi's iddat period, the time a woman goes into isolation after a divorce or her husband's death. Imran Khan and his wife then filed appeals, including the ones against their conviction and those seeking suspension of their sentences.Considering Khawar Maneka's repeated expression of no-confidence, the Islamabad high court (IHC), on Judge Arujmand's request, transferred the case to the court of additional district and sessions judge Muhammad Afzal Majuka.On June 25, the district and sessions court reserved its verdict on pleas against Khan and Bushra Bibi's conviction, after directions given by IHC to decide the matter of suspension of the sentences within 10 days, Geo News reported.The court had also given one month for the decision on the petition filed by the couple against their conviction. Meanwhile, Bushra Bibi had requested a decision on her plea filed in the sessions court seeking suspension of her sentence.The court will announce the reserved verdict on June 27 at 3 pm (local time) while the hearing on the couple's plea seeking annulment of their conviction in the said case will be resumed on July 2, Geo News reported.PTI has been awaiting a favorable decision as a major relief for Imran Khan, who has been acquitted in some cases or has been granted bail in others. However, it is also likely that the government will try to block his release as Pakistan prime minister's Adviser on political and public affairs Rana Sanaullah on Tuesday gave credence to the reports that the federal government was planning to register new cases against the incarcerated PTI founder.Speaking on Geo News programme 'Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath', Sanaullah said, ""Imran Khan's main agenda is to destabilise the country and spread chaos and anarchy in the country that's why the government will certainly try to keep him behind bars as long as possible.""Rana Sanaullah made these remarks while responding to a question on reports that the government was planning to delay the release of former Pakistan PM Imran Khan as the courts granted him relief in several cases, according to Geo News report.Sanaullah said Imran Khan ""boycotted"" parliament and launched the agitation movement against the government after the PTI government was ousted through a no-confidence motion in 2022.Pakistan PM's adviser said, ""Persistently he has only one agenda spread anarchy and mischief in the country, hence for the betterment of the country he [Imran Khan] should be kept behind bars.""

According to the militant, Bashir Zeb, commander of BLA Majeed Brigade, was complicit in the plan’s creation.Nasrullah alleged India’s intelligence agency R&AW was behind all this, that it wanted a BLA-TTP nexus, and that TTP bases be established in Khuzdar, Balochistan.“TTP chief Mufti Noor Wali Mehsudand the outfit’s defence minister, Mufti Muzahim, said we(TTP)and our friends(R&AW)have three objectives in establishing a foothold in Balochistan,” he claimed, adding: “Sabotaging CPEC projects, including targeting Chinese citizens; carrying out kidnappings for ransom to play up the matter of enforced disappearances so that intelligence agencies can be defamed; and spreading anarchy and frustration among the people by fomenting terrorist activities in Balochistan.”He claimed that Mehsud held meetings with R&AW agents at the Indian embassy in Kabul and that this was fully supported by the Afghan government.After showing Nasrullah’s video statement, Langau said, “The global community should have no doubt left that there is India behind all this.”He said that while TTP vowed to “introduce an Islamic system”, the BLA on the other hand was their “ideological opposite”. “Their nexus only means that their investor is the same who is using them from two angles,” he alleged. “If you look at the financial support or the intelligence of BLA and TTP, or their members sitting abroad, there is no doubt that RAW is funding them,” Langau alleged.","Minister Ziaullah Langau’s allegations came during a press conference in Quetta.

What they're saying

“A soft state can never gain the trust of investors,” PM Shehbaz remarked. “The responsibility of the fight against terrorism is the collective duty and the primary obligation of all state institutions. It’s not about you and me, it’s about us, we have to trample it together.”

""The campaign will be complemented by socioeconomic measures aimed at addressing genuine concerns of the people and creating an environment that discourages extremist tendencies,"" said a statement from Sharif's office.

Ihsanullah Tipu, a security analyst, noted, ""Pakistan views the use of active military force as the most effective approach to counter armed violence.""

Some analysts suggest that the operation's timing may also be influenced by domestic political and economic considerations. Asfandyar Mir of the US Institute of Peace said, ""With the election done and a government in place, and the economic situation stabilizing, Pakistani leadership probably feels confident to pursue a vigorous campaign.""

What is the main objective of

Operation Azm-e-Istehkam

?

The primary objective of Operation Azm-e-Istehkam is to curb the surge in violence and armed attacks within Pakistan. This includes addressing domestic security threats and dealing with armed fighters crossing over from Afghanistan. The operation also aims to implement socioeconomic measures to create an environment that discourages extremist tendencies.

Why now?

The timing of the operation is linked to a dramatic increase in violent incidents over the last 18 months. Most of these attacks have been claimed by the TTP , which ended a ceasefire in November 2022.

, which ended a ceasefire in November 2022. Additionally, recent attacks targeting Chinese interests in Pakistan have further underscored the urgency of a robust military response.

Pakistan has seen nearly 1,000 casualties from almost 700 incidents of violence in 2023. Attacks targeting Chinese installations and personnel have increased, highlighting the stakes for Pakistan's key ally, China, which has invested $62 billion in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ).

). Senior Chinese officials have also emphasized the need for improved security for Chinese nationals and investments in Pakistan.

How will the operation be different from previous military campaigns?

Unlike previous large-scale military operations that required mass displacement of local populations, Azm-e-Istehkam is not intended to be a kinetic large-scale military campaign. The focus will be on augmenting the efforts of armed forces with intelligence-based operations and legal measures to address terrorism-related cases. The operation is described as a “multi-domain, multi-agency, whole of the system national vision” for enduring stability.

What are the potential challenges to the success of this operation?

Security analysts highlight several challenges, including the transient nature of TTP bases in Pakistan and the risk of escalating tensions with Afghanistan if cross-border operations are conducted. Additionally, the lack of public support for security forces in provinces heavily affected by violence could hinder the operation’s effectiveness. There is also the issue of diverging approaches between Pakistan and China regarding the Taliban in Afghanistan, a report in AlJazeera said.

What has been the reaction of opposition parties to this operation?

Opposition parties, including the PTI, JUI-F, and ANP, have expressed significant criticism of the operation. They argue that it could worsen the volatile situation in border regions and have questioned the government's decision-making process, claiming it lacked sufficient consultation with parliament and local stakeholders.

How has China reacted to recent attacks targeting its nationals and investments in Pakistan?

China has expressed strong concerns over the security of its nationals and investments in Pakistan, urging the Pakistani government to take effective measures to protect them. Following attacks on Chinese engineers and installations, Chinese officials have reiterated the importance of security and the need to protect Chinese interests in the country.

Will the operation affect Pakistan’s relationship with Afghanistan?

The operation could strain already tense relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan, particularly if cross-border military actions are taken. The Taliban government in Kabul has consistently denied harboring TTP militants, and any escalation of military activities could complicate diplomatic relations further.

Since 2001, Pakistan's military has conducted many high-profile operations like ""Zarb-e-Azb"", ""Rah-e-Nijat"", ""Rah-e-Rast"" and many more against homegrown militants in border areas. It seems it's time for another military operation against militants in Pakistan. But the Pakistan military has failed to root out these militant groups time and again.However, under pressure from China, the Pakistan government has again approved a new military campaign named Azm-e-Istehkam, meaning ""Resolve for Stability."" This initiative, announced by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif after a review of the country's counterterrorism efforts, aims to address domestic security threats and the activities of armed fighters crossing over from Afghanistan.The operation comes amid heightened tensions between Islamabad and the Taliban rulers in Kabul.(With inputs from agencies)","Operation Azm-e-Istehkam aims to curb the surge in violence and armed attacks within Pakistan.

The charges related to the disappearances of his followers are still pending trial.He could face at least 12 years in jail, but can still appeal his conviction.Bamjan is believed by many Nepalese to be the reincarnation of Siddhartha Gautama, who was born in southwestern Nepal some 2,600 years ago and became revered as the Buddha. Buddhist scholars have been skeptical of Bamjan's claims.Bamjan was arrested from a house in a suburb of Kathmandu, the country's capital, after jumping two floors from a window in an attempt to flee.Police said they seized Nepalese banknotes worth $227,000 and other foreign currencies amounting to $23,000 at the time of the arrest.Bamjan became famous in southern Nepal in 2005, when claimed to be able to meditate without moving for months while sitting beneath a tree with no food or water.His popularity has declined amid accusations of sexual and physical assaults on his followers, but he still maintains camps in southern Nepal where thousands come to worship or live.","Ram Bahadur Bamjan is believed by some to be the reincarnation of the founder of Buddhism.

Rishi Sunak: Britain's Rishi Sunak struggles with missteps while trying to lift Conservatives ahead of elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/britains-rishi-sunak-struggles-with-missteps-while-trying-to-lift-conservatives-ahead-of-elections/articleshow/111305256.cms,"LONDON: British prime minister Rishi Sunak has portrayed himself as thorough and evidence-led throughout his relatively brief political career , but there's always been a nagging question over the keenness of his political antenna.The general election campaign over the past five weeks has clearly shown that he hasn't got the instinctive touch of some of his predecessors, such as Tony Blair or even Boris Johnson.Sunak's campaign has seen several missteps since he announced the July 4 election date in the pouring rain in late May, including his suspension of candidates mired in a scandal over betting on the date of the election a week after Labour Party leader Keir Starmer pressed him to do so.The biggest blunder, one that prompted him to apologize, was his decision to leave the 80-year D-day commemorations in northern France on June 6 early.Critics said the decision to skip the international event that closed the commemorations showed disrespect to the veterans and diminished the UK's international standing. Other world leaders including president Joe Biden, French president Emmanuel Macron, German chancellor Olaf Scholz and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy were all present. As was Starmer, who is the favorite to replace Sunak as prime minister.Since then, Sunak hasn't been able to lift the poll ratings for his Conservative Party, which have been depressed over the past few years as a result of the actions of his two immediate predecessors.First, Johnson was forced to quit after being adjudged to have lied to parliament over breaches of coronavirus lockdowns at his offices in Downing Street. Then, trust in the conservatives tanked during the chaotic and traumatic 49-day leadership of Liz Truss, whose unfunded tax cuts roiled financial markets and sent borrowing costs surging.Opinion polls suggest the Conservatives are likely to lose power for the first time in 14 years.""The Conservatives badly needed to deliver a boost to Sunak's leader approvals or their leader-focused campaign risks reinforcing weakness rather than building strength,"" said Rob Ford, a political scientist at the University of Manchester. ""A clumsy and error-strewn Sunak campaign has, however, entirely failed to shift the dial on leadership approval.""It must be said that Sunak isn't the most experienced campaigner. He's only been a member of parliament since 2015 and he has never been prominent in, let alone at the forefront of, a general election campaign.Sunak became prime minister in October 2022 when he pitched himself as a stable pair of hands to replace Truss. He has reminded voters that he had warned Conservative Party members about the recklessness of Truss's economic plan when he challenged her to succeed Johnson.""I was right then, when I warned about Liz Truss,"" he said. ""That's why all of you can trust me now.""On replacing Truss after an uncontested leadership battle, Sunak became Britain's first leader of color, the first Hindu to become prime minister and at 42, the youngest leader for more than 200 years.Sunak, now 44, had enjoyed a rapid rise to the top within conservative ranks. He was plucked from seemingly nowhere four years ago to become Treasury chief on the eve of the coronavirus pandemic.Within weeks, he had to unveil the biggest economic support package any chancellor of the exchequer has ever had to outside wartime.Smooth, confident and at ease with the march of modern technology, he was dubbed ""Dishy Rishi"" and quickly became one of the most trusted and popular faces within Johnson's administration during the rigors of the pandemic.As treasury chief, Sunak was lauded for rolling out a COVID-19 job retention package that arguably saved millions of jobs. But it came at a cost, bringing the country's tax burden to its highest level since the 1940s.That's not something he's particularly comfortable with. Sunak is instinctively a low-tax, small-state politician who idolizes former prime minister Margaret Thatcher.In his 20 months as prime minister, Sunak has struggled to keep a lid on bitter divisions within his Conservative Party. One side wants him to be much tougher on immigration and bolder in cutting taxes, while another urged him to move more to the centerground of politics, the space where, historically, British elections are won.Sunak was born in 1980 in Southampton on England's south coast to parents of Indian descent who were both born in East Africa. His father was a family doctor and his mother ran a pharmacy, whose accounts he'd often help with.He has described how his parents saved to send him to Winchester College, one of Britain's most expensive boarding schools. He then went to Oxford University to study politics, philosophy and economics- the degree of choice for future prime ministers.He then got an MBA at Stanford University, which proved to be a launchpad for his subsequent career as a hedge fund manager at Goldman Sachs in the US. There, he met his wife, Akshata Murty, the daughter of the billionaire founder of Indian tech giant Infosys. They have two daughters.The couple are the wealthiest inhabitants yet of No. 10 Downing Street, according to the Sunday Times' 2024 Rich List, with an estimated fortune of 651 million pounds ($815 million). They're even richer than king Charles III, a level of wealth that labour leader Starmer says makes Sunak out of touch with the everyday realities and struggles of working people.With his fortune secure, Sunak was elected to parliament for the safe Tory seat of Richmond in Yorkshire in 2015. In Britain's 2016 Brexit referendum, he supported leaving the European Union . When ""leave"" unexpectedly won, Sunak enjoyed a meteoric rise that swiftly led him to Downing Street.He's not used to losing.","Rishi Sunak is Britain's first leader of color, the first Hindu to become prime minister.

Cole attributes this to the revelations made in the Netflix docuseries.According to GB news, Cole said: ""William has done his duty.In great contrast to Prince Harry. Now, I don't think there's any chance at all of there being a reconciliation with the brothers now or in the foreseeable future."" ""It goes back to Oprah Winfrey interview, then the book Spare and all the things that were said in the Netflix six part series.""""There is too much bad blood. William is not going to forgive that, principally because he, of course, and his wife attacked personally, Kate, ""he said.""Even when the announcement of her cancer was mad their mealy mouthed response to it didn't show any great concern for her. William looks at them and and he would say what most people would say. All of this is completely unnecessary,"" he added.Cole suggests that William, like many others, would view Harry's actions as unnecessary, given the privileged life he has led as a member of the Royal family .He said, ""Prince Harry has had a wonderful, privileged life. He owes everything to being a member of the Royal Family. He's good looking. He's married to a beautiful wife. He's got two healthy, beautiful children.""He further added, ""He's got more money than we could shake a stick at.

A visit from Harry, with all the drama that would bring, would be the opposite of that.""An old friend of William revealed that William harbors significant animosity towards his brother Harry.“He absolutely fucking hates him,” he said when asked about the status of William's relationship with Harry, reports The Daily Beast.“Harry sold his family out to the media for millions of dollars, and William can’t forgive that breach of trust,” the friend added.When asked for the specific reasons about why William has developed a “loathing” of the brother he was once so close to, the friend also cited ""betrayal.""They said: “I think it’s exactly because the bond was so deep that the betrayal has been so wounding. They were the only people who actually knew what each other had been through. How would you feel if your best friend decided to reveal all your personal secrets to the newspapers? Well, multiply that by a thousand.“Harry is never going to apologize, at least not while he is married to Meghan , and William is never going to apologize either. So that’s that.”Prince William, who has been named the most popular male royal in a recent YouGov poll, maintains strict control over the royal family.William's firm approach includes an ""absolute ban on Harry returning in any way, shape or form to the family fold,"" despite King Charles's desire to spend more time with Prince Harry, his younger son.",Michael Cole has claimed that the chances of reconciliation between Prince William and Prince Harry are slim to none in the near future.
