NEW DELHI: Absence of Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge , leaders of opposition in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, respectively, from the Independence Day event at Red Fort on Friday drew a sharp reaction from BJP which alleged that the main opposition party, Congress, has hit a ""new low"" with its top functionaries ""insulting"" the country by ""boycotting"" the event.Rahul had attended the programme last year but was absent this time. Kharge was absent last year as well. The Congress leadership steered clear of making a statement on the issue but sources said party heads have chosen to distance themselves from such events as they feel the governing dispensation discriminates against opposition members in terms of seating arrangements and protocol.""Even those holding constitutional positions are not shown due respect - instead of being seated in the front row, they are placed in the third row,"" a source said.BJP sources refuted the charge as a ""lame alibi"".

NEW DELHI: PM Modi rejected Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) with Pakistan as 'unjust and one-sided', reiterating India's position that ""blood and water cannot flow together"" and asserting that India will ""no longer tolerate nuclear blackmail"". In his I-Day speech Friday, the PM lauded Operation Sindoor and the role played by armed forces, while outlining India's ""new normal"" that, he said, will ""not differentiate between terrorism and those who nurture terrorism"".Modi declared from Red Fort that IWT is not acceptable to India as the country's farmers suffered unimaginable losses because of the treaty, backed by World Bank. ""The waters that belong to India will be used by India, for our farmers alone. We would no longer tolerate an arrangement that deprived its farmers. India has endured this for decades. We will not endure it any further. In the interest of our farmers and the nation, this agreement is unacceptable to us,"" PM said.He said Operation Sindoor, which saw India bombing terrorist headquarters in Pakistan and POK, reflected the anger and frustration that people felt after Pahalgam terror attack. ""Terror headquarters hundreds of kilometres inside enemy territory were destroyed. Terrorist infrastructure was turned to rubble. Pakistan is still having sleepless nights. There was so much destruction there that even now there are new revelations coming out,'' said Modi, alluding to the disclosure by IAF last week that six Pakistani aircraft were brought down in the military conflict in May.""For a long time, nuclear blackmail had been going on but this will not be tolerated anymore,'' the PM said.Modi stressed that India will continue to give a befitting reply to enemies of the nation.

PM Modi's Stern Warning to Pakistan After Nuclear Threat, Refuses To Resume Indus Waters Treaty

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday announced plans for a grand celebration of the second birth centenary of renowned 19th century social reformer Jyotiba Phule, in what can be seen as an important gesture to OBCs who revere the anti-caste activist, who also championed women's education.""In the near future, we will be marking the 200th birth anniversary of the great social reformer Jyotiba Phule. We are going to begin the celebrations for this anniversary. Phule's principles and the mantra ""priority to the backward"" are an inspiration for us,"" said Modi. The proposed celebrations mark the elevation of Phule, who was born into Mali caste, to the national pantheon. BJP included Phule and his wife Savitribai, known for her 'passionate and tireless' advocacy for women's education, among its gallery of icons long ago. But Modi's plans for his bicentenary turn the embrace into a warm hug.Modi said his govt is working to implement Phule's mantra. ""By giving priority to the backward, we want to reach the heights of transformation. We want to put in our utmost effort for this. Through transparent policies, we wish to make ""priority to backward"" a reality on the ground, bringing it into the lives of every backward person"".The remarks were seen from multiple prisms, including the impending decision on vice president, choice of the new BJP chief, and Bihar polls where OBCs will play the decisive role.Phule, for long, has been a major influence on the OBCs in Bihar, with many among the intermediate castes of Kushwahas and Koeris, who, like Malis, are engaged in horticulture, regarding him as one of their own.The PM also spoke about Dalits and other deprived sections while stressing the need for govt to be proactive about improving lives. ""Whether they are Dalits, the oppressed, the exploited, or the deprived, govt should be proactively positive for them, govt should be pro-people,"" he said.Modi said some people suffer from the misperception that his govt was implementing schemes for welfare of the deprived sections the same way as its predecessors. ""We are implementing schemes on the ground. We emphasise saturation because if there is any true execution of social justice, it is in saturation where no eligible person is left out.""Phule's bicentenary celebrations would mark the co-option by BJP of a second legendary social reformer from Maharashtra, after B R Ambedkar was formally inducted into its 'Hall of Inspirations'. The practice of adopting even those who had once seemed incompatible with the party's original ethos has gone hand-in-hand with the expansion of its base beyond the core. It gathered momentum under Modi who, as PM, moved vigorously to identify the party with Ambedkar's legacy.","PM Narendra Modi announced plans for a grand celebration of the second birth centenary of renowned 19th century social reformer Jyotiba Phule.

SRINAGAR: Chief minister Omar Abdullah decried Friday the practice of tying terror attacks to J&K’s political fate and asserted that Pakistan should not be allowed to influence it through terrorism, a day after Supreme Court observed that “incidents like Pahalgam” must be considered when deciding on statehood.“Will the killers of Pahalgam and their masters in the neighbouring country decide whether we will be a state?” Omar said in his Independence Day speech, his first since taking office last Oct and the first by a CM since Article 370’s abrogation and J&K’s conversion into a Union territory Aug 2019.Speaking at Srinagar’s Bakshi Stadium, Omar termed SC’s reference to Pahalgam “unfortunate” and asked: “What kind of justice is it? Every time we are close to statehood, they will do something to sabotage it. Is this fair? Why are we being punished for a crime in which we had no role?” He pointed out that “J&K’s residents from Kathua to Kupwara” had protested the Pahalgam massacre of April 22 in which 26 people, mostly tourists, were gunned down.The CM announced a signature campaign across all 90 constituencies of J&K in the next eight weeks with the aim of submitting signatures to Supreme Court in support of restoring statehood and to take “people’s voice directly to Delhi”.The top court on Thursday gave Centre eight weeks to respond to petitions seeking statehood. “Me and my colleagues will use these eight weeks to go to each constituency,” Omar said.In his speech steeped in lament, the CM cited reports in various quarters about an “announcement this Independence Day from Delhi” -- an allusion to restoration of statehood. “I had hoped that in some corner of today’s (PM Narendra Modi’s) speech, there would be an announcement for J&K. We were told the papers are ready and it’s only a matter of time. But nothing happened.”Expressing his anguish further, Omar said he wished no one became the CM of a Union Territory with an assembly -- like J&K --comparing the National Conference (NC) govt he leads to “a horse asked to run with two front legs tied”. “It has nothing except pain and anxieties. I have been chief minister of the state and now of the UT. The system of dual governance is not for success but for instilling defeat.”The Omar-led govt does not control key departments such as home, which is vested with Centre-appointed lieutenant-governor (LG) Manoj Sinha.Omar said he had never imagined before taking office that his cabinet’s decisions “could be altered or thrown into the dustbin”, remarks seen as an allusion to the LG’s overriding powers. “I am accountable to the assembly and assembly members to the people. But the bureaucracy in the present system is not answerable to the elected representatives.”","Omar Abdullah decries practice of tying terror attacks to J&K’s political fate.

KISHTWAR: The death toll in the cloudburst-triggered flash flood that devastated Chishoti in J&K's Kishtwar district rose to at least 60 on Friday as rescue workers dug out more bodies from the debris of a pilgrim campsite along the Machail Mata trail that bore the brunt of the calamity. Dozens are still reported missing, raising the possibility of casualties spiking as the hours tick by.Uprooted trees, boulders the size of houses and mounds of sludge sat where rows of tents and food stalls had been set up to cater to pilgrims either making their way to the ancient Machail Mata temple – 8.5km from the site – or making a stopover on their way back.Remnants of a wooden bridge, a rucksack, shoes entangled in the branches of uprooted pines and cars half buried under the rubble spoke of the gale force with which the sudden flooding occurred. Many of the victims were pilgrims having lunch at the langar (community kitchen) there.CM Omar Abdullah, who cancelled his ""At Home"" tea party scheduled for Independence Day after the disaster, reached Kishtwar on Friday to take stock. He told reporters that besides the confirmed deaths and those still missing, over 100 people were injured in the disaster.Officials said 167 survivors had been rescued till late Friday, while 69 other people believed to have been there at the time of the cloudburst were still to be found.Witnesses said they heard what sounded like a blast, followed by a ferocious burst of water and boulders and logs tearing through the pilgrims' campsite and the vicinity.""Within two minutes of the cloudburst, we were trapped in water up to our knees,"" said Suresh Mehra, who was on the Machail Mata pilgrimage with five relatives. ""We hurried to what appeared to be the safer side of the village.

""We had just finished tea in a restaurant when we heard security personnel asking us to run. My sister and nephew are still missing.

Poll Should India continue purchasing oil from Russia despite US tariffs? Yes, for national interest No, avoid conflict

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to visit the United States in September for the United Nations General Assembly meeting, which is to take place in New York City.According to the provisional list of speakers for the high-level debate of the 80th session of the General Assembly, India’s “Head of Government (HG)” will address the session on the morning of September 26, reported news agency PTI.The Heads of Government of Israel, China, Pakistan, and Bangladesh are also scheduled to address the UNGA general debate on the same day. PM Modi 's visit to New York, if it takes place, will come at a time when the US has bumped up tariffs on New Delhi to 50 per cent for purchasing Russian crude oil, which US President Donald Trump claimed has ""fueled"" Moscow's war with Ukraine.On August 6, Trump announced an additional 25 per cent tariff on most imports from India for buying Russian oil. Coming on top of the 25 per cent tariff he already announced, the additional tariff is set to bring the taxes on goods and products India exports to the US to 50 per cent if fully implemented.rump not only doubled down on tariffs but also announced a penalty on India for purchasing Russian military equipment.The executive order signed by Trump, citing threats to US national security because of India's purchase of oil from Russia, goes into effect on August 27, providing a three-week window of opportunity to negotiate an agreement.India responded strongly to Trump's move to impose an additional 25 per cent tariff. The ministry of external affairs in a statement called the US move unfortunate and reiterated its stand that India would continue to protect its national interests.In a strongly worded statement, the MEA said, ""..it is extremely unfortunate that the US should choose to impose additional tariffs on India for actions that several other countries are also taking in their own national interest.""However, amid the tariff row, a US trade delegation is expected to visit India before August 25.Meanwhile, Trump will be meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin on August 15 in Alaska to discuss an end to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said, ""The highly anticipated meeting between myself, as President of the United States of America, and President Vladimir Putin of Russia will take place next Friday, August 15, 2025, in the Great State of Alaska."" ""Further details to follow. Thank you for your attention to this matter!"" he added.Putin’s trip to Alaska will be his first to the US in a decade. The last time Russia’s leader was in the country for a meeting at the UN General Assembly in New York in September 2015 with then-President Barack Obama.The announcement came just hours after Trump told reporters he planned to discuss the ongoing war in Ukraine with Putin. The President expressed cautious optimism, saying he believes “we have a shot” at brokering a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine.The 80th session of the UNGA will open on September 9. The high-level General Debate will run from September 23-29, with Brazil as the traditional first speaker of the session, followed by the US.US President Donald Trump will address world leaders from the iconic UNGA podium on September 23, his first address to the UN session in his second term in the White House.","PM Narendra Modi is expected to visit the United States in September for the United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York City.

The worst hit was Buner district in the northwest, where 157 people died on Friday after homes and villages were swept away.Authorities declared a state of emergency in Buner as rescuers, using boats and helicopters, struggled to reach stranded families. Ambulances carried more than 100 bodies to hospitals.In neighbouring Mansehra district, emergency teams worked through Thursday night to rescue around 2,000 tourists trapped by flash floods and landslides in the Siran Valley.A helicopter carrying relief supplies crashed in Bajaur due to bad weather, killing all five on board, including two pilots.Pakistan's prime minister Shehbaz Sharif has directed the disaster-management authority to evacuate affected families and tourists.Pakistan’s disaster agency has now issued fresh warnings about glacial lake outburst floods in the north and advised travellers to stay away from risky areas.Since June 26, rain-related disasters have killed at least 556 people across the country, according to the national disaster management authority.Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan region has also seen repeated floods since July, with landslides blocking the Karakoram highway.Experts say such cloudbursts and floods are becoming more common due to climate change. A new study found rainfall in Pakistan this monsoon was 10–15% heavier because of global warming, according to news agency Associated Press.In 2022, Pakistan faced its worst monsoon disaster, which killed more than 1,700 people and caused damage worth billions of dollars.","At least 243 people have been killed by flash floods in Pakistan.

Martina Navratilova, the famous former tennis player, spoke up on August 14, 2025, on her X account. She shared how upset she was with President Donald J. Trump. Trump had taken over the Washington, D.C. , police force and brought in 800 National Guard troops, saying the move was needed to fight rising violent crime in the city. But crime was actually at a low. Navratilova shared a Rolling Stone report and wrote plainly: “He would love nothing more than an excuse to open fire on protesters.” She once said, calling out Trump’s policy,One of the all-time greats, Martina Navratilova, renounced her former nation and is now a United States citizen. She achieved 18 Grand Slams overall and won her first at Wimbledon in 1978 against Chris Evert.Under Section 740 of the DC Home Rule Act, President Trump signed an executive order on August 11, 2025. He said violent crime was surging and took temporary control of the Metropolitan Police Department. He also sent in 800 National Guard soldiers to the capital.But news outlets like PolitiFact and local officials, including Mayor Muriel Bowser, said crime had actually gone down since 2023.Studies found violent crime dropped by about 26–35 per cent in recent years.In response, many residents took to the streets.

US President Donald Trump said that his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin , reportedly described the 2020 presidential elections as “rigged” because of mail-in voting.“Vladimir Putin said your election was rigged because you have mail-in voting. He said no country has mail-in voting. It's impossible to have mail-in voting and have honest elections,” Trump said in an interview with Fox News on Friday.Trump also reiterated his claim that there would not have been a war between Russia and Ukraine, and millions of lives would have been saved if he won the 2020 elections.""And if you have won, we wouldn't have had a war. You'd have all these people, millions of people, alive now instead of dead,"" Trump said in the interview.Following a closed-door meeting with Putin in Alaska that lasted more than three hours, Trump described the talk as “warm” and said that he agreed on a lot of points with Putin and they are pretty close to making a deal on the ongoing conflict.When asked for his advice to Kyiv, Trump strongly urged Ukraine to strike a deal, stressing the imbalance of power between the two countries. ""Make the deal. Gotta make a deal. Yeah.Look, Russia is a very big power and they're not. They're great soldiers and they have great. But, you know, they also had the best equipment. You know, they had our equipment,” Trump said.Putin has previously said that the “crisis in Ukraine,” referring to Russia’s full-scale military offensive, might not have happened if Trump had been the US president at that time.""I cannot but agree with him that if he had been president, if his victory hadn't been stolen in 2020, then maybe there would not have been the crisis in Ukraine that emerged in 2022,"" Putin said earlier this year, as per a state TV reporter.Trump also previously criticised former president Joe Biden ’s handling of the crisis as “not good”. “I always felt, so when I left, there wasn't even a chance that this would happen. When Biden got involved, I won't say whether or not he handled it properly, but obviously it wasn't good, because the war started,"" Trump said.“I think if I didn't win the election, he would have gotten all of Ukraine. I think he would have taken all of Ukraine,"" he added.Trump previously demanded the appointment of a special prosecutor to examine the 2020 election, which he lost to Democrat Joe Biden, once again repeating an unfounded claim of widespread fraud.“Biden was grossly incompetent, and the 2020 election was a total FRAUD!” he said through a post on social media. “The evidence is MASSIVE and OVERWHELMING. A Special Prosecutor must be appointed. This cannot be allowed to happen again in the United States of America! Let the work begin!”The cybersecurity division of the Department of Homeland Security declared the election “the most secure in American history,” reported Al Jazeera.","US President Donald Trump said that his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, reportedly described the 2020 presidential elections as “rigged” because of mail-in voting.

"How Goa managed to tame rabies: Inside state's drive that vaccinated 63,000 dogs in 30 days",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/how-goa-managed-to-tame-rabies-inside-states-drive-that-vaccinated-63000-dogs-in-30-days/articleshow/123328961.cms,"Representative Image

PANAJI: Since Sept 2017, Goa has largely eliminated human rabies cases, earning a “rabies-controlled” status in 2021 after three consecutive years without a single death from the virus. The streak was broken by one case in 2023, but there were no fatalities in 2024 and none so far this year. “Even if a single stray dog misses vaccination and sterilisation, it can lead to a litter of eight or nine puppies that are at risk,” said Nilkanth Harlankar, the state’s minister for animal husbandry and veterinary services.The story began in 2014 when the threat of rabies in Goa was all too real: 17 people succumbed to the virus that year. There was no reliable data on the dog population — stray or pet — nor any formal record of dog mortality. Then came Mission Rabies, a fledgling NGO with a pilot surveillance project that uncovered a grim truth: of the 45 suspected animal cases they investigated, 39 tested positive for rabies.Instead of being daunted, they doubled down, aiming to vaccinate 50,000 dogs in just 30 days. By the end of the month, over 500 vets from 16 different countries joined forces with local teams and managed to exceed the target: they vaccinated 63,000 dogs.This momentum translated into policy the very next year. In 2015, the thenCM Manohar Parrikar signed an MoU with Mission Rabies, launching a full-fledged vaccination and sterilisation drive across the state. Following this, Goa had 24-hour rabies surveillance, an emergency hotline, rapid response teams, and field volunteers fanning out to every taluka, vaccinating and sterilising dogs, and assisting bite victims.From Sept 2017, human rabies cases in Goa virtually disappeared. But the Covid-19 lockdown brought fresh challenges. As tourism halted and markets closed, hungry stray dogs from neighbouring states wandered into Goa. Mission Rabies suspects this migration led to a spike in animal cases in border talukas.Goa’s borders with Maharashtra and Karnataka remain points of vulnerability, with rabies cases still detected in talukas like Bicholim, Pernem, Sattari, and Canacona. “We are vaccinating stray dogs in border talukas on a warfooting,” said Harlankar. In June 2021, it was made mandatory for visitors bringing pets into Goa to declare their animals and share vaccination records via the anti-rabies hotline to prevent cross-border transmission.","The story began in 2014 when the threat of rabies in Goa was all too real. 17 people succumbed to the virus that year.

As they walked, four F-35s and a B-2 Spirit bomber flew directly over the two leaders.The moment was captured on video, showing visuals of jets startling the Russian president as he walked alongside Trump on the red carpet.The B-2 Spirit, a symbol of American military might, is capable of carrying both conventional and nuclear weapons. They were used in Operation Midnight Hammer last June to strike Iran’s three key underground nuclear sites.Seven B-2s flew 36 hours non-stop from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri to Iran, striking targets at Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan with 75 precision-guided weapons.B-2 bombers are equipped for long-haul flights. The B-2 first entered service in 1997 and each one costs more than $2 billion; the US Air Force has a fleet of 19, after losing one in a crash in 2008. Attack at Fordow marked the longest B-2 bomber mission since the initial American assault on Afghanistan following the Sept.11, 2001, terrorist attacks.Next, President Putin faced an unexpected media encounter in Alaska, where reporters bombarded him with questions as he arrived for talks with US President Donald Trump on the Ukraine conflict.Foreign journalists called out questions on issues ranging from civilian casualties to prospects for a ceasefire in the three-year-old war. There was no clear response to whether he would agree to a ceasefire.Such open exchanges are rare at events attended by the Russian leader, where the travelling press pool is generally limited to state-approved reporters.","The two leaders exchanged greetings and shook hands on the runway when Putin arrived at the base for his talks with Trump.

Why did the lawsuit happen now?

What are the disputed directives?

How has Trump's takeover been enforced?





Washington, DC Attorney General Brian Schwalb on Friday filed a federal lawsuit seeking to block US President Donald Trump's takeover of the city's Metropolitan Police Department (MPD).The legal challenge came hours after US Attorney General Pam Bondi named Drug Enforcement Administration chief Terry Cole as the department's emergency commissioner.Schwalb said the lawsuit asks the court to rule that Trump's action is illegal.""The administration's unlawful actions are an affront to the dignity and autonomy of the 700,000 Americans who call DC home,"" he said. ""This is the gravest threat to Home Rule that the District has ever faced, and we are fighting to stop it.""Bondi's directive, issued Thursday night, gives Cole authority over the powers and duties of the police chief. She ordered that the MPD must receive Cole's approval before issuing any directives.Mayor Muriel Bowser wrote that ""there is no statute that conveys the District's personnel authority to a federal official.""It remains unclear how the move affects Police Chief Pamela Smith, who works for the mayor.Neither Bondi's office nor the White House responded immediately to requests for comment.Bondi rescinded several MPD policies, including a recent directive from Smith allowing limited cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.The Justice Department said Bondi opposed the chief's order because it still allowed so-called ""sanctuary policies"" that restrict local law enforcement's ability to assist in immigration enforcement.Smith had instructed Metropolitan Police Department officers to share information with immigration agencies about people not in custody, such as those stopped at traffic checks. However, she said other MPD policies remain in place, restricting inquiries into immigration status and prohibiting arrests based solely on federal immigration warrants.Schwalb told Smith in a memo that ""members of MPD must continue to follow your orders and not the orders of any official not appointed by the Mayor.”Trump said Monday he was deploying hundreds of National Guard troops to Washington and temporarily taking over the city's police department to address what he called a crime emergency.Federal law enforcement agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and Customs and Border Protection have been patrolling streets and making arrests.Residents have reported a heavy federal presence, with Humvee vehicles positioned at Union Station and National Guard troops at major landmarks.","Washington, DC Attorney General Brian Schwalb on Friday filed a federal lawsuit seeking to block US President Donald Trump's takeover of the city's police department.

Historical denialism in Japan

Seeking to make Japan a 'victim' of foreign conspiracies

Japan's history seen through the eyes of victims

Japan should 'stop apologising'





August 15th marks the 80th anniversary of Japan's unconditional surrender and the end of World War II, putting focus once again on reckoning with the country's past. The domestic debate in Japan on shaping narratives about World War II is so tense that it is often referred to as ""history wars. ""Japan's actions during the war are also a sore spot in international diplomacy. China and both North and South Korea have bitter memories of life under Japanese occupation, and rarely miss an opportunity to remind their neighbour of the past.Inside Japan, what were once far-right fringe voices have grown more prominent in recent years by insisting on a narrative denying or minimising the brutality of Imperial Japan during World War II. Historical revisionist groups want the victims of Imperial Japan's rampage across Asia and the Pacific eight decades ago to leave history in the past.""There are very few people alive today who experienced the war in any of these countries, but I do not think they will ever stop talking about it because it is an effective tool with which to bash Japan,"" said Hiromichi Moteki, chairman of the Tokyo-based Society for the Dissemination of Historical Fact, which promotes a narrative of Japan's actions during World War II that denies the atrocities that Japan committed.""They want to claim the moral high ground over Japan, but all we want to do is have the right to remember and honour our war dead and teach our younger generations the history of the nation,"" he told DW.Moteki's organisation seeks to spreads its message by translating Japanese nationalist works of historical revisionism into English.An article published in the Georgetown University's Journal of International Affairs exploring historical revisionism in Japan describes Moteki's organisation as part of an ""interlocking web of small but vocal lobby groups"" that emerged as part of a ""denialist movement"" in the 1990s.Other groups with similar aims include the ""International Research Institute of Controversial Histories"" or the ""Historical Awareness Research Committee.""Moteki's group, for example, claims World War II was not a war of aggression started by Japan but an act of self-defence against the US and European nations that had colonised Asia. It claims Imperial Japan ""liberated"" the countries it conquered.Similar to other nationalist organisations, the society also falsely insists that euphemistically named ""comfort women,"" most of whom were from Korea, were not abducted and forced into sexual servitude but were in fact well-paid prostitutes. It also contends that Allied prisoners of war were well treated and that labourers from Korea and Taiwan willingly toiled in mines, shipyards or factories during the conflict.At the same time, the group says the US committed war crimes by dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The deniers claim that the hundreds of trials carried out by the allies prosecuting Japanese troops for war crimes were merely ""victor's justice.""""These groups share a distinctive method of historical writing similar to the methods of Holocaust denialism,"" writes Tessa Morris-Suzuki, professor emerita of Japanese history in the College of Asia and Pacific at Australian National University.""They seize on historical documents that are often relatively obscure and cherry-pick them for information that supports their cause. These fragments of information are then strung together without contextualization into writing that overlooks source reliability, ignores contradictory evidence, and fundamentally misrepresents content,"" Morris-Suzuki wrote in the Georgetown Journal of International Affairs.""These issues are embedded in a wider, all-embracing view of twentieth-century Japanese history: one that presents Japan as the victim and attributes negative images of Japan's pre-war and wartime past to international propaganda conspiracies,"" she continues.The Georgetown report, which was published in 2021, said a ""substantial number"" of conservative lawmakers ""belong to lobby groups which disseminate revisionist views.""Historical revisionist lobby groups have also worked with diplomats on propaganda efforts abroad, including opposing monuments to ""comfort women"" in countries like the US and Germany.Yuji Hosaka is a professor of history and politics at Sejong University in South Korea who has long been critical of Japan's failure to honestly address its past, or to teach younger generations of Japanese the truth about the war-time era.""I see many on the right in Japan who just want to forget about all the bad things that happened when Japan occupied Korea and invaded China and Southeast Asia,"" he said. ""These people often say that Japan brought development and modern technology to help these countries, but that just makes the people of Korea angry.""Korean historians largely agree that after annexing the peninsula from 1910, Japan forcefully assimilated the Korean people, forbade them from speaking their own language, suppressed the indigenous culture and exploited the land and its people. The intent was to make Korea a part of the Japanese empire, with thousands of Koreans serving in the Japanese military during the war.Hosaka says that Japanese history school books still gloss over the atrocities carried out by the Japanese military, with often little or no mention of the Nanjing Massacre which killed hundreds of thousands in China, the abuse of civilian labourers and POWs, or other crimes for which Japanese were executed after the war.""Those who forget the past will inevitably find themselves in a similar situation again in the future,"" he said. ""It is imperative that Japan learns from the past.""""In the past, Germany and France worked together to create common history books for their children,"" he added. ""I believe that Japan should reach out to Korea and China and do the same thing.""An editorial in the July 7 edition of the China Daily newspaper declared, ""It's time Japan faced its war crimes and militarist past.""For China, the Nanjing Massacre continues to bear weight in the present day.According to Chinese historians, 300,000 civilians and soldiers were killed in a six-week frenzy of murder, torture, rape, arson and looting after the invading Japanese military entered Nanjing, then the capital city of China, on December 13, 1937. The massacre is recognised internationally as well. The Encyclopaedia Britannica writes that the ""number of Chinese killed in the massacre has been subject to much debate, with most estimates ranging from 100,000 to more than 300,000. ""Those who had ordered the massacre were executed after being found guilty of committing war crimes by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East in 1948.Moteki and others on the right say successive Japanese leaders have expressed genuine remorse for what happened nearly a century ago but that other countries always say the apologies are inadequate or are insincere.""It will never change,"" said Moteki, who was born in 1941.""Japan has to defend itself from these criticisms and verbal attacks. But the time has come for Japan to stop apologising because it is meaningless now.""On August 15, the anniversary of the emperor announcing in a radio broadcast that Japan was surrendering, Moteki will go to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine in central Tokyo to pay his respects to war dead.He will be surrounded by thousands more who want to mark the anniversary, including dwindling numbers of old soldiers, the relatives of men who fought, and far-right groups in uniforms.Yasukuni is the last resting place of more than 2.4 million military and civilian victims of war in Japan since 1869. To other nations, however, Yasukuni is a controversial symbol, as it also honours more than 1,000 people convicted of war crimes.","August 15th marks the 80th anniversary of Japan's unconditional surrender and the end of World War II. Historical revisionist groups want the victims of Imperial Japan's rampage across Asia and the Pacific eight decades ago to leave history in the past.

‘Reprehensible act’: Indian temple in US vandalised; consulate seeks probe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/reprehensible-act-indian-temple-in-us-vandalised-consulate-seeks-probe/articleshow/123275155.cms,"



A Hindu temple in the United States has been vandalised, prompting condemnation from the Indian Consulate in Chicago. In a post on X, the consulate described the desecration of the main signboard of the BAPS Swaminarayan Temple in Greenwood, Indiana, as “reprehensible” and confirmed it had raised the matter with law enforcement for prompt action. The Consul General met devotees, local leaders and the Mayor of Greenwood, urging unity, solidarity and vigilance against “miscreants”.The incident comes less than 6 months after a similar act of vandalism at the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in Chino Hills, California. At the time, ministry of external affairs condemned the act “in the strongest terms” and urged local authorities to act swiftly and ensure security at places of worship. BAPS Public Affairs said the Hindu community would “stand steadfast against hate” and “never let hate take root”.The Coalition of Hindus of North America also linked such incidents to rising hostility towards Hindus, noting the timing ahead of a planned “Khalistan referendum” in Los Angeles. Previous attacks on BAPS temples were reported in Sacramento and New York last year, fuelling concerns over repeated targeting of Hindu places of worship across the US.","Vandalism at BAPS Swaminarayan Temple in Indiana described as'reprehensible' Indian Consul General met devotees, local leaders and the Mayor of Greenwood, urging unity, solidarity and vigilance against'miscreants' Incident comes less than 6 months after a similar act of vandalism at the BAPS Shri Swaminrayan Mandir in California.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123275239,imgsize-985007,width-400,resizemode-4/123275239.jpg"

'Treated like a criminal': New Zealand woman and 6-year-old son detained by ICE at US border; narrates 'terrifying' ordeal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/treated-like-a-criminal-new-zealand-woman-and-6-year-old-son-detained-by-ice-at-us-border-narrates-terrifying-ordeal/articleshow/123274510.cms,"Image: GoFundMe@/VictoriaBesancon





A New Zealand woman held at a US immigration center with her six-year-old son after being detained while crossing the Canada-US border is being “treated like a criminal,” said her friend and advocate, reported the Guardian.Sarah Shaw, 33, a New Zealander who has lived in Washington state for just over three years, dropped her two older children at Vancouver Airport on July 24 for them to take a direct flight to New Zealand to visit their grandparents.When she tried to re-enter US, the immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) detained her and her youngest son in what her friend Victoria Besancon described as a “terrifying” ordeal.“Sarah thought she was being kidnapped,” Besancon said, as quoted by the Guardian. “They didn’t really explain anything to her at first; they just kind of quietly took her and her son and immediately put them in like an unmarked white van.”Her phone was then confiscated, and she was transported to the Dilley immigration processing center in South Texas.Shaw is currently applying for a green card under a provision for domestic violence survivors. According to the GoFundMe page organised by Besancon, Shaw had work authorisation but had not yet received travel permission under what's known as a “combo card,” although her son had such permission.“It wasn’t until she tried to come back across the border that she realised only half of the combination card, because it’s only one physical card, had been fully approved,” Bescanson said.Meanwhile, all three of Shaw’s children have their I-360 visas approved, and Bescanson claimed that Sarah’s youngest son was therefore being held “illegally.”Minda Thorward, Shaw’s attorney, said that under the previous administrations, customs and border protection (CBP) would likely have quickly paroled her back into the country, but that approach has changed under Trump, reported NBC King 5 News.Shaw, who works for the Washington state department of children, youth, and families (DCYF), was preparing to start graduate school soon, as per the GoFundMe page.The fund, which raised over $33,000 by Monday morning, aims to cover legal fees and basic needs after Shaw depleted her savings on legal representation, reported Newsweek.“She gives therapy and counselling to some of our most at-risk youth … and to be treated like a criminal herself has just been absolutely devastating,” Bescanson said as quoted by the Guardian.Several legal US residents have been detained by ICE in the past months. While some detainees reportedly have criminal histories that might justify visa revocation, others argue that errors in paperwork led to their detention and believe they should be released.New Zealand’s foreign affairs ministry has confirmed that they are in contact with Shaw but provided no further details due to privacy concerns, reported The Guardian.","Sarah Shaw, 33, a New Zealander who has lived in Washington state for just over three years, dropped her two older children at Vancouver Airport on July 24 for them to take a direct flight to New Zealand.

Alaska summit: Putin's visit to US his first since 2015,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/alaska-summit-putins-visit-to-us-his-first-since-2015/articleshow/123328511.cms,"Trump said he and Putin agreed that the Ukraine conflict would end with land swaps and US-backed some type of security guarantee.





Russian President Vladimir Putin's closely-watched Friday meeting with President Trump in Alaska on Friday was the former's first visit to the United States in a decade. Putin's last visit was in Sept 2015, for the UN General Assembly in New York. At the gathering, he faced off with President Barack Obama, with dueling speeches in the morning and a tense meeting at night.Putin's address to the assembly was a defiant one in which he defended backing the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad and dismissed Western condemnation of Russia's annexation of Crimea.Obama delivered a forceful warning against the perils of leaving Assad in power and allowing Ukraine's sovereignty to be violated.That evening, the two leaders shared a terse handshake before entering a Security Council consultation room for a private meeting.Relations between the two had been so fraught in the preceding days that neither side would even admit to having sought the meeting in the first place, and it appeared to conclude with few resolutions.Before the UN meeting, Putin's last visit to the US was far more relaxed. In the summer of 2007, President George W Bush invited him to the Bush family's coastal compound in Kennebunkport, Maine.The two men took a ""full blast"" speedboat ride with former President George Bush - a journey that Putin ""loved"" and his interpreter appeared to find ""nerve-wracking,"" Bush later recounted.The visit was an attempt to smooth over some of the differences between the Russian and American leaders, including over Iran's nuclear program and American plans for a missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic. ""We had a good, casual discussion,"" Bush said. The two former American presidents also took the Russian leader fishing, with Putin reeling in the only catch of the day.

2016 Presidential Campaign

The First Meetings

Trump's Second Term





President Donald Trump's posture toward President Vladimir Putin of Russia over the last two decades or so has veered from admiring to infuriated, cozy to detached. The latest meeting was at least their seventh known face-to-face encounter, and the first of Trump's second term. Here's a look at some of the past meetings, and what the two have said about each other over the years:In 2007, after Time magazine selected Putin as its ""Man of the Year,"" Trump wrote him a congratulatory letter. ""As you probably have heard, I'm a big fan of yours!"" Trump wrote. Six years later, Trump took the Miss Universe contest to Moscow. Months before the pageant, which he owned at the time, he wondered on social media if Putin would attend, and if so, ""will he become my new best friend?"" Putin did not attend.Soon after he formally announced a run for the White House in 2015, Trump told reporters in July that he would ""get along very well with Vladimir Putin."" The exchange of compliments continued that year, when Putin called Trump ""a very bright and talented man,"" and Trump said that praise was a ""great honour.""In July 2016, though, Trump seemed to backtrack after saying repeatedly for years that he had a relationship with Putin.""He said one nice thing about me. He said I'm a genius. I said thank you very much to the newspaper and that was the end of it. I never met Putin,"" he said. During the final presidential debate in 2016, Hillary Clinton suggested that he would be Putin's ""puppet,"" which Trump dismissed. But questions over Trump's ties to Russia did not go away, and after he took office in Jan 2017, Russia's role in the US election dominated conversation in the US.The first in-person meeting between the two leaders took place at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, where Trump asked Putin about Russian interference in the election. Putin denied any involvement. After the meeting, Trump took his interpreter's notes and instructed him not to brief anyone.They met again in Nov that year, in Vietnam, and in July 2018 in Helsinki, Finland. On both occasions, Putin denied interfering in the 2016 election. In Helsinki, Trump stood beside Putin and challenged the conclusion of his own intelligence agencies about Russian election interference. Later in 2018, the two leaders spoke informally at dinner during a G20 meeting in Argentina.They met once more before the end of the first Trump term, at the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan, in June 2019. By then, the special counsel Robert Mueller had concluded that Russian had carried out a ""sweeping and systematic"" attack on American democracy. Asked by a reporter whether he would tell Russia not to meddle in US elections, Trump said, ""Yes, of course, I will."" He then turned to Putin, with a half-grin, and said, ""Don't meddle in the election, President,"" as Putin chuckled.As he began his second term, Trump expressed an interest in swiftly bringing an end to the war in Ukraine. But his relationship with President Zelensky of Ukraine took a nosedive in Feb after a fiery confrontation at the White House. Trump began to indicate frustration with Putin as the war proved harder to end than he had expected. ""I'm not happy with Putin,"" Trump said in July. He appeared to soften his comments ahead of the meeting in Alaska, saying he ""got along well"" with Putin.","Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin have met at least seven times over the years. Trump has said he has a good relationship with Putin, but has also been critical of him. The latest meeting was the first of Trump's second term, and the first in-person meeting between the two.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123328496,imgsize-26732,width-400,resizemode-4/123328496.jpg"

US President Donald Trump and former rival Hillary Clinton's relationship seems to be taking a new turn. From rivalry to maybe friendly, as Clinton promised to nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize if he ended the Russia-Ukraine war.Trump on Friday described it as “very nice” and said, “Well, uh, that was … very nice.""“I may have to start liking her again,” the president added of Clinton, the former first lady, secretary of state and two-time defeated presidential candidate, as he travelled aboard Air Force One for a high-stakes meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska.“Honestly, if he could bring about the end to this terrible war, if he could end it without putting Ukraine in a position where it had to concede its territory to the aggressor, could really stand up to Putin — something we haven’t seen, but maybe this is the opportunity — if President Trump were the architect of that, I’d nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize,” she told podcast host Jessica Tarlov, New York Post reported.The president has already been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by Rep. Buddy Carter (R-Ga) and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for his efforts in securing a cease-fire between Israel and Iran.The governments of Pakistan and Cambodia also indicated they have nominated Trump for the prize.Trump’s role in negotiating a peace framework between Azerbaijan and Armenia similarly resulted in the leaders of both nations expressing support for Trump winning the prize.

AP/PTI(AP08_16_2025_000011A)





Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday claimed that he would not have invaded Ukraine if Joe Biden had not been in office, a remark seen as courting Donald Trump, even as US tariff threats persist.“I’d like to remind you that in 2022, during the last contact with the previous administration, I tried to convince my previous American colleague the situation should not be brought to the point of no return when it would come to hostilities,” Putin said after his nearly three-hour summit with Trump in Alaska.“And I said it quite directly back then. That's a big mistake today, when President Trump is saying that if he was the president back then, there will be no war — and I’m quite sure that it would indeed be, so I can confirm that.”“President Trump and I established a very good, businesslike and trusting contact. And I have every reason to believe that by moving along this path, we can reach - and the sooner, the better - the end of the conflict in Ukraine,” he added.Trump has frequently expressed the belief that Putin would not have initiated the invasion had he been president in 2022, but he did not appear to engage with the dictator’s provocation on Friday.Ahead of the meeting in Alaska, Trump, while in his flight, told Fox News that this Ukraine war is Biden's war and he was the one who screwed up.""I'm not doing it based on history, based on anything else — I'm doing it based on a deal. If we make a deal, great. If I see that there's no hope of making a deal, I'm out of there... This isn't my war. This is Biden's war. Biden screwed this up..."" Putin said.Trump subtly reminded Putin that he would not engage in any business dealings with Russia until the Kremlin ceased its three-year war on Ukraine, highlighting the US’ leverage.“We … have some tremendous Russian business representatives here, and I think everybody wants to deal with us. We’ve become the hottest country anywhere in the world in a very short period of time,” he said. “We look forward to dealing — we’re going to try and get this over with. “… We’ll have a good chance when this is over.”Trump said that he and Putin did not reach an agreement to resolve Moscow’s war in Ukraine, though he characterized the meeting as “very productive.”“There were many, many points that we agreed on,” Trump said at a joint press conference with Putin. “I would say a couple of big ones that we haven’t quite got there, but we’ve made some headway. So there’s no deal until there’s a deal.”","Vladimir Putin said he would not have invaded Ukraine if Joe Biden had not been in office.

Fraud probe: New Orleans mayor indicted on multiple charges; accused of hiding romantic relationship with her bodyguard,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fraud-probe-new-orleans-mayor-indicted-on-multiple-charges-accused-of-hiding-romantic-relationship-with-her-bodyguard/articleshow/123326552.cms,"New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell (AP image)





A federal grand jury on Friday indicted New Orleans mayor LaToya Cantrell on charges of conspiracy, fraud and obstruction, stemming from allegations that she tried to hide a romantic relationship with her bodyguard.The indictment marks the conclusion of a multi-year federal investigation into Cantrell, the city’s first female mayor in its 300-year history.Her bodyguard, Jeffrey Vappie, has pleaded not guilty to charges of wire fraud and making false statements. Prosecutors allege that Vappie hid the relationship with Cantrell while submitting false payroll records claiming he was on duty. Vappie, who retired from the police department last year, is scheduled to stand trial in January.Federal authorities say Cantrell and Vappie exchanged encrypted messages through an app to avoid detection and deleted the conversations afterward. Both have maintained that their relationship was strictly professional.Acting US Attorney Michael Simpson described the case as a “three-year fraud scheme that we allege exploited their public authority and positions.” He said Cantrell arranged for Vappie to attend 14 trips, claiming these were occasions when they were “truly alone.”The indictment states that in 2021, Cantrell and Vappie “developed a personal and intimate relationship” and allegedly used their public positions to hide it and create opportunities to spend time together. Simpson added that Cantrell falsely claimed in a 2021 affidavit that her phone automatically deleted messages, when the function was only activated in December 2022 after media scrutiny.Following photos taken by a private citizen showing Cantrell and Vappie dining together and drinking wine, Cantrell reportedly filed a police report and sought a restraining order.Cantrell will leave the office in January. Her second term has been marked by clashes with City Council members and a failed recall effort in 2022.“This is a sad day for the people of New Orleans,” said Monet Brignac, a spokesperson for City Council President JP Morrell. “Our thoughts and prayers are with the Cantrell family as they navigate through this difficult time.”Cantrell has not posted on her X account since July 15, when she reported that there have been historic declines in crime in the city. Political observers note that her public profile has diminished in recent months due to disputes with the city council and restrictions on her executive powers approved by voters.Cantrell and her supporters argue that she has been unfairly targeted as a Black woman and held to a different standard than male officials. Earlier this year, she described some of the treatment she received as “very disrespectful, insulting, in some cases kind of unimaginable.”","New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell indicted on charges of conspiracy, fraud and obstruction.

Putin's body language far from cold







Body language expert Patty Ann Wood gave her verdict on the historic handshake of President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin and said the handshake had warmth but Trump clearly sees Putin as more powerful as he placed his hand palm up, allowing Putin to place his palm on top.Speaking to Newsweek, Wood said the handshake had a blend of deference, control and familiarity. ""As Trump stands waiting, he's smiling—a sign he's comfortable and looking forward to the event,"" Wood said. ""It's his natural smile, small and slightly downturned at the corners. His shoulders are back more than usual; he might be wearing a form-fitting undergarment because his posture is unusually erect. This all suggests confidence. ""The expert noted that Trump was respectful towards Putin as the Russian president approached -- he was applauding lightly. Then Trump took a step forward.""Trump typically likes to have his hand on top, but here it appears he presented his palm up—a weaker, more subordinate position—indicating he sees Putin as more powerful,"" Wood said.""Still, he uses a signature Trump move: keeping the handshake tight to his mid-body to pull the other person in, a display of power,"" the expert said.Trump and Putin maintained eye contact and smiled showing warmth and also a balance of deference and assertion, as their heads remained close together, Wood said.CNN noted that Putin was seen grinning as he peered out of the window of Donald Trump's limo. The same closeness was maintained when they were sitting down for their meeting as both Trump and Putin offered a few smiles.""The Russian president is known for conveying his mindset through his posture. Former US presidents have commented on his habit of slouching in his chair as they are speaking, in a sign of his disinterest,"" CNN noted""He wasn’t slouching in Alaska. Instead, he sat forward in his chair as the meeting got underway, hands clasped, as cameras clicked and reporters shouted unanswered questions,"" CNN added.","Body language expert Patty Ann Wood gave her verdict on the historic handshake of President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

B-2 bomber steals the show







President Donald Trump greeted Russian president Vladimir Putin with a handshake that was watched closely by the world and decoded instantly by the social media body language experts as the 'alpha-male' power move. As the two leaders shook hands, Trump pulled in Putin's hand in his characteristic way of shaking hands to show dominance, though many said Putin had the ""alpha top dog, knuckles up"" hand, proving dominance over Trump as his hand was over Trump's hand and not the other way round.The height difference between Putin and Trump was another stark feature that caught attention as the two leaders met after 2018. Vladimir Putin is officially 5 feet 7 inches tall, while Trump is 6 feet 3 inches tall. But the visible height difference was not as much as their recorded heights. This triggered theories that Putin uses lifts to increase his actual height which could be as low as 5 feet 2 inches.""Trump is 22 cm taller than putin (190 vs. 168), yet in the photo they appear almost the same height — Putin wearing heels again?"" one wrote.""Putin is supposed to be 5'7 and Trump 6'3. One of them is lying about their height..."" another wrote.Social media pundits noted that the handshake of the two world leaders was overshadowed by the flyover of American military planes including B2 stealth bomber that passed overhead.Putin joined Trump in his presidential limo as they head to their meeting. ""The move is unusual, particularly for an adversary. When Trump wanted North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un to join him in his car during their meeting in Singapore in 2018, aides talked him out of it,"" CNN noted""But this is a different era for Trump, with different advisers and objectives. And while their actual face-to-face meeting has been expanded to include advisers, it’s an indication that Trump and Putin will still have a moment to themselves — even if it’s only for a short car ride,"" CNN added.",Body language experts decoded the 'alpha-male' power move of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin.

Pakistan announces Army Rocket Force Command,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-announces-army-rocket-force-command/articleshow/123311070.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: Pakistan turned its Independence Day celebrations on Thursday into a carefully choreographed display of military muscle and political messaging headlined by the announcement of a new Army Rocket Force Command.The event at Islamabad’s Jinnah Stadium, branded Marka-e-Haq (“Battle of Truth”), saw Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif share the stage with army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir, ISI chief Lt Gen Asim Malik, and Asifa Bhutto Zardari. Military representatives from Turkey and Azerbaijan added a touch of foreign endorsement.In his address, Shehbaz also unveiled “Misaq-e-Istehkam-e-Pakistan (Charter for Stability)”, pitched as a call for unity beyond partisan divides.The newly announced rocket force marks a first in Pakistan’s military structure, signalling ambitions for precision-strike capability. But with the economy still under strain, the decision is likely to spark debate over balancing strategic aspirations with fiscal realities.On foreign policy, Shehbaz expressed gratitude to China, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Azerbaijan, UAE, Iran, and, pointedly, US President Donald Trump, for support during tensions with India. He reiterated Pakistan’s firm positions on Kashmir and Palestine, indicating no softening of regional stances.The Independence Day spectacle underscored an image of civil-military unity in a country where political turbulence often overlaps with military dominance. Whether Marka-e-Haq becomes more than pageantry will depend on Islamabad’s ability to deliver on promises of reform, stability, and economic recovery long after the parades are over.","Pakistan turns its Independence Day celebrations into a carefully choreographed display of military muscle and political messaging.

‘Seed Of Pakistan Will Be Destroyed’: Foreign Affairs Expert Warns Islamabad After Nuke Threat





PESHAWAR/ISLAMABAD: Four people were injured when an improvised explosive device derailed six coaches of the Peshawar-bound Jafar Express in the Mastung district of Pakistan's restive Balochistan province on Sunday.There were, however, no casualties, officials said.This is the latest in a series of attacks targeting the Jafar Express.The improvised explosive device (IED) explosion hit the track near Spezand Railway Station, about 25 km from Quetta, shortly after the train with 350 passengers had departed the city at 9 am (local time), a railways official said.""A bomb attached to the railway track exploded loudly, derailing six bogies of the train heading from Quetta to Peshawar. Fortunately, there was no loss of life,"" Muhammad Kashif, public relations officer of the Pakistan Railways' Quetta division, told the media.All injured passengers sustained minor wounds, the official said.Rescue teams, including railway staff, were dispatched to the site, and a relief train was sent to transport stranded passengers to Quetta.Security forces and police cordoned off the area, while a bomb disposal squad was deployed to clear the track.Meanwhile, in a separate statement, Kashif said the services of the Jaffar Express and Bolan Mail were suspended till August 14.The Bolan Mail will resume its operations on August 16 (Saturday), when it will depart from Karachi ""in its proper turn"" and will arrive in Quetta the next day, he added.The Jafar Express, which runs between Quetta and Peshawar, has been repeatedly targeted in recent months.On August 7, the train narrowly escaped a disaster near Balochistan's Sibi railway station, where a bomb planted near the track exploded just after the passenger train had passed.In another incident, on August 4, gunmen fired five bullets at its pilot engine near Kolpur. The separatist Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for the latter attack.In June, a remotely controlled explosive device fitted to rail tracks exploded, causing four bogies of the Jaffar Express to derail in Jacobabad.On March 11, the Jaffar Express was hijacked while traveling from Quetta to Peshawar in the Bolan area, resulting in the deaths of 21 passengers and four security personnel. The security forces in a targeted operation killed 33 terrorists involved in attacking the train.It is believed that ethnic Baloch terrorist groups carry out such attacks.A July 28 derailment of the same train in Sindh province's Sukkur was initially attributed to an explosion but the Ministry of Railways later said it was due to a technical fault.","A bomb attached to the railway track exploded loudly, derailing six bogies of the train heading from Quetta to Peshawar.
