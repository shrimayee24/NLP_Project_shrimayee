NEW DELHI: US envoy to India Eric Garcetti on Thursday highlighted the necessity of close cooperation between the United States and India, particularly as the world is seeing more conflicts.""I know that India likes its strategic autonomy , but in times of conflict, there is no such thing as strategic autonomy,"" Garcetti said in an event in New Delhi.""In crisis moments, we will need to know each other. I don't care what title we put to it, but we will need to know that we are trusted friends, brothers and sisters, and colleagues in times of need.""Garcetti further stressed the importance of investing in the US-India relationship. ""It's important for us as Americans and as Indians to remember that the more we put into this relationship, the more we will get out of it. The more we insist on a kind of cynical calculation in place of a trusted relationship , the less we will get,"" he said.He also urged his Indian counterparts not to take the bilateral relationship for granted.""While it is wider and deeper than it's ever been, it is not yet deep enough. If we take it for granted, I will have to fight many defence battles to help this relationship move ahead,"" Garcetti remarked, underscoring the ongoing efforts to strengthen ties between the two nations.Garcetti's comments follow the Biden administration's reaffirmation that India remains a strategic partner for the US, despite concerns about its relationship with Russia.Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently visited Russia for 22nd India-Russia annual summit, which was closely watched by Western countries due to the ongoing Ukraine conflict.During his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, PM Modi stressed that the Ukraine conflict cannot be resolved on the battlefield and emphasized the need for peace efforts.Spokespersons from the Pentagon, White House, and State Department addressed India's ties with Russia and PM Modi's visit to Moscow. Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder said, ""India and Russia have had a longstanding relationship. From a US perspective, India is a strategic partner with whom we continue to engage in full and frank dialogue, including discussions about their relationship with Russia,"" as quoted by news agency PTI.Discussing the implications of PM Modi's visit, Ryder noted, ""I do not think anybody will be surprised if (Russian) President (Vladimir) Putin tries to represent this visit in a way that seeks to somehow show that he is not isolated from the rest of the world. And the fact of the matter is President Putin's war of choice has isolated Russia from the rest of the world, and it has come at great cost. Their war of aggression has come at great cost, and the facts bear that out.""","US envoy to India Eric Garcetti highlighted the necessity of close cooperation between the United States and India.

Second ex-president of J&K bar body held within 3 weeks under PSA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jk-high-court-bar-ad-hoc-chairman-held-under-psa/articleshow/111669600.cms,"SRINAGAR: Senior advocate and ad hoc chairman of J&K High Court Bar Association ( HCBA ) Nazir Ahmad Ronga was arrested early Thursday from his home in Nishat area of Srinagar , according to his family. He was charged under public safety act ( PSA ), which allows authorities to detain a person without trial for up to a year.“At 1.10am, a contingent of J&K Police arrived at our home without any arrest warrant, merely stating, ‘It’s an order from above’ (“uper se order hai”).We are left in a state of shock and profound distress…,” his lawyer son Umair Ronga posted on X. He also posted two videos showing uniformed personnel taking away his father.Ronga, 75 is a member of Mirwaiz Umar Farooq’s Awami Action Committee, a constituent of the separatist Hurriyat Conference. Ronga, a former president of the bar association, is the second ex-president to be arrested after Mian Abdul Qayoom Bhat was taken into custody on June 25 for an alleged conspiracy leading to the fatal terrorist attack on lawyer Babar Qadri in 2020.Bhat, who is now in his late 70s, had authored the constitution of Hurriyat Conference’s Syed Ali Shah Geelani faction in 1993. His son-in-law Javed Iqbal Wani is a serving HC judge. Bhat has been in and out of jail several times.Ronga’s family said he has been shifted to Kot Bhalwal jail in Jammu, about 250km from Srinagar. The administration has not issued any statement on his arrest. In Oct 2021, police searched Ronga’s home in cases allegedly involving his son, following accusations of irregularities in three private companies registered in his name.Ronga’s arrest came a day after the bar association issued a notice for elections of office bearers. J&K administration had not allowed HCBA to conduct elections in the past five years due to the pandemic and fear of a law and order situation. In 2020, the then district magistrate of Srinagar had sought an explanation from the bar regarding its constitution.In July this year, HCBA dropped the paragraph from its constitution that called for “working towards a peaceful settlement of the Kashmir dispute.” The bar was now preparing for elections before July 31.Mirwaiz Umar Farooq denounced Ronga’s arrest: “To arrest him in such a manner in the middle of the night even without a warrant is highly regrettable. Besides, Ronga sahab is an elderly person and not keeping well.”PDP president Mehbooba Mufti slammed the arrest. “…GOI (govt of India) hasn’t only failed to end militancy but is venting its frustration by launching a vicious crackdown on helpless Kashmiris. Nazir Ronga is the latest victim of its oppressive actions,” she posted on X.","Nazir Ahmad Ronga was arrested early Thursday from his home in Srinagar.

From a US perspective, India is a strategic partner with whom we continue to engage in full and frank dialogue to include their relationship with Russia,"" Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder told reporters at a news conference, in the backdrop of the Nato summit in Washington, where the alliance called China a ""decisive enabler"" of Russia in its war on Ukraine.Amid critical commentary in the US media that the Modi trip to Moscow showed Putin was not as isolated as claimed by the Biden administration, Ryder suggested the Russian leader may be trying to represent the visit in such a manner but ""the fact of the matter is President Putin's war of choice has isolated Russia from the rest of the world, and it has come at great cost"".He also pointed out that Modi also met recently with the Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskyy and offered his assurances that India will continue to do everything within its means to support a peaceful solution to the war in Ukraine.""I think that we trust that India will support efforts to realise an enduring and just peace for Ukraine and will convey to Mr Putin the importance of adhering to the UN charter and the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" he added.The Biden administration's (and Nato's) view of Russia and its invasion of Ukraine is undercut by the fact that former president Donald Trump and his MAGA principals take a more benign view of Moscow, believing that the US ""deep state"" is unnecessarily stoking wars, in part by extending Nato to Russia's borders.The possibility of Trump's return to the White House has been a constant undercurrent at the Nato summit which concludes on Thursday, with many European leaders expressing apprehension about the future of the alliance should that happen.The former president has been dismissive about Nato and its purpose, and on Wednesday, even as President Biden was talking up the alliance, Trump was denigrating it.“I didn’t know what the hell Nato was too much before,” he told cheering supporters at an election rally, making his ignorance public. “But it didn’t take me long to figure it out, like about two minutes. And the first thing I figured out was they were not paying. We were paying, we were paying almost fully for Nato. And I said that’s unfair.”He then went in to relate how he had told a shocked Nato ally that the US would not protect it from Russia if it did not pay its designated share of the alliance funding.But amid the uncertainty surrounding Nato's future should Trump return to the White House, the Atlantic alliance appeared to expand its sights beyond Moscow, saying China’s “no limits” partnership with Russia and its “large-scale support for Russia’s defence industrial base” are enabling Moscow to wage its war on Ukraine.“This includes the transfer of dual-use materials, such as weapons components, equipment, and raw materials that serve as inputs for Russia’s defence sector,” the Nato declaration said.China rejected the charges, saying the Nato summit was “filled with cold war mentality and belligerent rhetoric"".",Pentagon hopes India will play a role in persuading Moscow to end its war on Ukraine.

American-made M4 carbine assault rifles frequently used in recent J&K terror attacks; experts call it 'alarming',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/american-made-m4-carbine-assault-rifles-frequently-used-in-recent-jk-terror-attacks-experts-call-it-alarming/articleshow/111651341.cms,"NEW DELHI: Terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir have been found using American-made M4 carbine assault rifles , particularly during the latest attacks in Kathua. Experts told PTI that they find this trend ""alarming"" as the weapons left behind by the US Army after their withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 appear to have reached the extremists through Pakistani handlers.The M4 carbine rifles, designed and developed in the 1980s, have been extensively used by Nato and reportedly by several militaries, including Pakistani special forces and the Special Security Unit of the Sindh Police.These rifles have been employed in numerous conflicts worldwide, such as the Syrian civil war, Iraqi civil war, Yemeni civil war, Colombian conflict, Kosovo war, and the Iraq and Afghanistan wars following 9/11. The increased maneuverability of the M4 carbine makes it a favored choice among military forces.According to experts, the frequent use of these assault rifles by terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir is a result of the US Army leaving behind arms and ammunition during their withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. The use of steel bullets in these weapons, which are more lethal, is a cause for concern.Lieutenant General Sanjay Kulkarni, a defense expert who served in Jammu and Kashmir during his tenure in the Indian Army, believes that Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) has been assisting terrorists with sophisticated weapons like M4 carbine rifles to further their malicious intentions in the region.The first instance of an M4 carbine rifle being recovered in Jammu and Kashmir was reported on November 7, 2017, when Talha Rasheed Masood, a nephew of Jaish-e-Muhammad chief Masood Azhar, was killed in a gunfight in Pulwama district. Since then, the weapon has been recovered multiple times, including during encounters with other high-profile terrorists. Shesh Paul Vaid, former Director General of Jammu and Kashmir Police, noted that the frequent use of M4 carbine rifles by terrorists in the region was not prevalent during his tenure from December 2016 to September 2018.In recent months, the M4 carbine has reportedly been used in all major attacks in the Jammu region, including the Kathua attack on July 8, the Reasi attack on June 9, and the Poonch terror attack last December. While acknowledging that sophisticated weapons like the M4 carbine increase the probability of casualties, Vaid expressed hope that security forces will effectively deal with the challenge and adapt to face situations where the enemy is equipped with such advanced weaponry.","Terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir have been found using American-made M4 carbine assault rifles.

Eight-year-old girl gang-raped and killed by minor schoolmates in Andhra Pradesh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/girl-8-raped-killed-in-ap-3-minors-held/articleshow/111643062.cms,"TIRUPATI: An eight-year-old girl was gang raped and later murdered, allegedly by three school-going minor boys, at Muchumarri village in Pagidyala mandal of Nandyal district in Andhra Pradesh . The incident took place on Sunday but came to light on Wednesday after police took the accused into custody. While the girl was a student of class III, two of the accused (12 years) are students of class VI and one student (13 years) is in class VII.The girl and the accused were from the same school.According to Nandikotkur police, the minor girl’s father lodged a missing complaint on Sunday, stating that his daughter, who was playing at Muchumarri park, was missing. Police searched everywhere in Muchumarri and questioned locals for information but couldn’t find the girl. They also pressed the dog squad into action.The clues provided by the sniffer dog helped the police zero in on the three minor boys. The dog not only led the police to the scene of the crime but also stopped at the houses of the accused. After initial round of investigation, the minor boys were taken into custody. On questioning, the boys allegedly confessed to raping and killing the little girl. The accused told the police that after killing the girl, they pushed the body in an irrigation canal to hide their crime.The three boys told the police that they spotted the girl playing near Muchumarri park. As she knew them by face, they persuaded her to come with them to play. They then gagged her near an isolated spot near Muchumarri irrigation project, and raped her one after the other. Fearing that they could be arrested if the girl complained to her parents about the rape , they killed her and pushed her body into the nearby canal and left the spot.No one was present at the scene of the crime, but police said they cracked the case based on the clues provided by the sniffer dog. Even as the police and the girl’s parents were searching for the girl for the last three days, the accused went on with their routine schedule as if nothing had happened. Nandyal MLA G Jayasurya visited the victim’s family and promised that strict penal action will be taken against the accused.Police are yet to trace the body of the girl. The water level in the canal is deep and it is not clear if the body was washed away to a distance due to monsoon rains. The search has been intensified all along the canal to fish out the body.","Girl was gang raped and later murdered, allegedly by three school-going minor boys.

He mentioned that he has undergone three brain health checks while in office, with the most recent one occurring in February. Biden asserted that his neurological capacity is tested daily through the decisions he makes and suggested that age brings wisdom.Despite the pressure from fellow Democrats to withdraw from the race, Biden on Thursday in an interaction with reporters reaffirmed his commitment to running for re-election . However, he acknowledged the need to address the concerns of detractors and American voters regarding his fitness for office, particularly following a challenging debate performance.The president highlighted his extensive travel schedule and participation in numerous major events across various states as evidence of his ability to persuade and connect with voters.","US President Joe Biden indicated willingness to undergo a neurological examination if recommended by his doctors.

"Watch: In another slip of tongue, Biden refers to Kamala Harris as 'vice president Trump' in solo press conference",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-in-another-slip-of-tongue-biden-refers-to-kamala-harris-as-vice-president-trump-in-solo-press-conference/articleshow/111674437.cms,"President Biden's solo press conference in Washington on Thursday was marked by a notable gaffe when he mistakenly referred to vice president Kamala Harris as ""vice president Trump"" while responding to the opening question.The president said, ""Look, I wouldn't have picked vice president Trump to be vice president [if] I think she's not qualified to be president,"" confusing Harris with former president, Donald Trump .When a reporter pointed out the error in the final question, asking Biden to comment on the blunder that Trump had used to mock him, the president simply smiled and replied, ""Listen to him,"" before exiting the stage.Earlier, during a Nato event, before the press conference, Biden mistakenly even referred to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as ""President Putin"". ""And now I want to hand it over to the president of Ukraine, who has as much courage as he has determination, ladies and gentlemen, President Putin,"" Biden said at the Nato summit in Washington on July 10.The solo press conference, which lasted an hour, was seen as a crucial opportunity for Biden to demonstrate his ability to handle challenging questions and think on his feet in an unscripted setting, especially amidst growing pressure from Democrats for him to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race . This pressure had intensified following his poor performance in the June 27 CNN debate against Donald Trump and his campaign's subsequent inability to address voters' concerns about his health.However, the press conference did not appear to alleviate Democrats' worries. Shortly after Biden left the stage, house representative Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, and house representative Scott Peters, D-Calif, released statements calling for the president to exit the race. Peters said, ""The stakes are high, and we are on a losing course.""Throughout the week and during the press conference, Biden firmly rejected any suggestion that he should or would drop out, maintaining that he was the most capable candidate to defeat Trump in November. He did, however, acknowledge that he would consider leaving the race if his team advised him that there was ""no way"" he could win.Despite his intention to salvage his struggling campaign, the president made several verbal missteps and appeared to lose his train of thought on multiple occasions while answering reporters' questions during the solo news conference. Trump and his campaign shared several clips of Biden's gaffes on Truth Social.In another notable slip, Biden referred to his chief of staff as ""my commander in chief"" before correcting himself. The president said that he -- the American commander-in-chief -- would consult ""my commander-in-chief"" on questions about arming Ukraine.The solo news conference was his first in eight months. Biden's last solo news conference was in November, during a summit with President Xi Jinping of China.","Biden mistakenly referred to vice president Kamala Harris as ""vice president Trump"" While responding to the opening question, Biden said, ""I wouldn't have picked vice president Trump to be vice president [if] I think she's not qualified to be president"" Biden also referred to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as ""President Putin"" during a Nato event.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111674518,imgsize-910312,width-400,resizemode-4/111674518.jpg"
US to resume sending shipments of 500-pound bombs to Israel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/us-to-resume-sending-shipments-of-500-pound-bombs-to-israel/articleshow/111674286.cms,"The United States is advancing plans to send 500-pound bombs to Israel, following a pause over concerns about the potential use of 2,000-pound munitions in populated areas, according to a US official. The shipment was halted in early May when Israel appeared to be on the brink of a major ground operation in Rafah , southern Gaza , which the US government strongly opposed.Israel later launched a more limited incursion.""We've been clear that our concern has been on the end-use of the 2,000-pound bombs, particularly in advance of Israel's Rafah campaign which they have announced they are concluding,"" said the US official, speaking anonymously.Due to the way shipments are organized, different munitions are sometimes combined, the official explained. ""Because our concern was not about the 500-pound bombs, those are moving forward as part of the usual process.""Last month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused President Joe Biden's administration of slowing down weapons deliveries to Israel amid the ongoing Gaza conflict, sparked by the October 7 Hamas attack. US officials denied the allegations, noting that only the single bomb shipment was affected.During a news conference on Thursday, President Biden confirmed that the 2,000-pound bombs would not be sent to Israel. ""I'm not providing the 2,000-pound bombs. They cannot be used in Gaza or any populated area without causing great human tragedy and damage,"" he said.The United States remains Israel's primary military supporter but has expressed frustration over the increasing civilian death toll in Gaza. Since the October 7 attack, which resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, Israel has conducted extensive operations against Hamas, leading to at least 38,345 deaths, also predominantly civilians, according to Gaza health ministry data. The militants have also taken hostages, with 116 still in Gaza, including 42 presumed dead.","The shipment was halted in early May when Israel appeared to be on the brink of a major ground operation.

Donald Trump Jr mocked the rescheduling and said now it has moved past his bed time.This will be the first time he will be facing the press, taking questions from them first time since November -- also first time after the June debate which raised calls from the Democrats to change the candidate.The CNN debacle was followed by the ABC News interview which also did little to control the damage. But amid all these, there were occasions where Biden appeared resolute and defiant.Biden passed the first Nato fitness test as he appeared assertive and coherent on Tuesday in his speech. Thursday is a bigger test for him as he will be closing out the Nato summit and take questions.Biden's health and daily scheduled have come on the radar as his aides defended the dismal performance by saying that Biden functions the best between 10 to 4 daytime window. It was also reported that Biden told Democratic governors that he need to sleep more and that he would limit his public events after 8pm.Some Democrats have suggested that putting Biden into the public eye more often would help ease concerns.Over the course of his three-and-a-half years in office, Biden has held fewer press conferences and interviews combined than presidents dating to Ronald Reagan in the 1980s at the same point in their presidency, data by presidential scholar Martha Joynt Kumar showed. He has held an average of 10.5 press conferences per year, compared to 22 per year for Trump and 35.5 for George H.W. Bush, according to an analysis by the University of California at Santa Barbara. Reagan had fewer with 5.8 per year.Biden answered more questions than either Bill Clinton or Barack Obama, but fewer than either George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, and far fewer than Trump.After Thursday's news conference, Biden's next big interview will be with NBC anchor Lester Holt on Monday.""There will be a lot of eyes on every move Biden makes,"" said a Democratic strategist with close ties to the White House. ""There'll be closer scrutiny - everything he says and does.""Biden's top aides are thinking about performance hurdles and his day-to-day appearances in three phases: Get through a big speech on civil rights in Austin, Texas on Monday, then the Democratic convention in Chicago where Biden is to be formally nominated in mid-August and from there the final push to Election Day on Nov. 5, a source with direct knowledge said.(With agency inputs)","Donald Trump Jr mocked the rescheduling and said now it has moved past his bed time.

""Clooney didn't have eyes on the entire event,"" Kayla said.""I saw Biden three weeks ago at my fundraiser for him. It's devastating to say it but he is not the same man he was, and he won't win this fall. I’m a lifelong Democrat; I make no apologies for that. I’m proud of what my party represents and what it stands for.

But our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn’t see what we just saw. We’re all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we’ve opted to ignore every warning sign. The George Stephanopoulos interview only reinforced what we saw the week before.

Following a highly anticipated press conference of President Joe Biden, Democrat Jim Himes and 16 other top Democrats have urged President Joe Biden to suspend his 2024 re-election campaign . This call comes after Biden's halting debate performance against Republican rival Donald Trump, raising concerns within his party about his continued candidacy.During the press conference, held at the conclusion of the Nato summit in Washington DC on Thursday night, President Biden addressed reporters' questions. Despite the mounting pressure, Biden expressed his determination to stay in the race, asserting his fitness to serve as president now and for the next four years.Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., voiced his concerns shortly after the press conference. ""Joe Biden’s record of public service is unrivaled,"" Himes posted on X. ""His accomplishments are immense. His legacy as a great president is secure. He must not risk that legacy, those accomplishments and American democracy to soldier on in the face of the horrors promised by Donald Trump.""Biden's age and performance have been central issues in the growing criticism and backlash against his candidacy.While many lawmakers have expressed unease with Biden's continued candidacy - and others have steadfastly backed the incumbent's plans - here is a list of those who have directly called for Biden to not run again.","""I ask President Biden to withdraw from the presidential campaign. The stakes are high, and we are on a losing course,"" Rep. Scott Peters says. Rep. Jim Himes: ""The 2024 election will define the future of American democracy"" Rep.

Slip-ups to addressing health concerns: Key takeaways from Biden's press conference,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/slip-ups-to-addressing-health-concerns-key-takeaways-from-bidens-press-conference/articleshow/111674611.cms,"Here are the key takeaways from Biden's first solo news conference:

Slip-up came early

On Kamala Harris being a potential replacement

On Israel-Gaza war

Will Biden drop out of the race?

On health concerns

US President Joe Biden faced the much-anticipated challenge on Thursday - a solo press conference where he was questioned by the White House press corps.The purpose of this news conference was to reassure discouraged Democratic lawmakers, allies, and persuadable voters in the upcoming election that Biden still possesses the strength and stamina required to be president.Biden has blamed his dismal debate performance on ""feeling terrible"" due to a cold, as he sought to save his reelection campaign.During the press conference, President Biden made a notable gaffe early on when he mistakenly referred to Vice President Kamala Harris as ""Vice President Trump."" The slip-up occurred while explaining his decision to choose her as his running mate, believing she could defeat Trump in an election.Prior to the news conference, Biden had already committed a significant blunder at the NATO summit, which instantly lowered expectations for his performance. While introducing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Biden accidentally said, ""Ladies and gentlemen, President Putin."" The mistake immediately elicited gasps from the audience. Realizing his error, Biden quickly corrected himself, turning to Zelenskyy and saying, ""President Putin? You're going to beat President Putin.""When a reporter brought up Biden's reference to ""Vice President Trump"" and pointed out that the presumptive Republican nominee's campaign was already capitalizing on the slip-up, the President remained defiant. ""Listen to him,"" he said before exiting the stage, refusing to engage further with the question or acknowledge the potential impact of his mistake.When asked about Harris' capability to take over his role, Biden affirmed his confidence in her qualifications, stating, ""I wouldn't have picked her unless I thought she was qualified to be president,"" and highlighted her experience as a prosecutor and US Senator.However, when questioned further, Biden admitted that he had shifted away from his 2020 campaign promise to serve as a ""bridge"" to a new generation of Democrats.He attributed this change to ""the gravity of the situation I inherited,"" without mentioning his vice president. Biden emphasized his commitment to completing his current responsibilities, repeatedly asserting, ""I've got to finish this job.""Biden announced that Israel and Hamas have agreed to a ceasefire framework, although some details still need to be finalized. He mentioned that he had dispatched his team to the region to work out the specifics of the agreement.""That framework is now agreed on by both Israel and Hamas. So I sent my team to the region to hammer out the details,"" Biden said in a news conference.The President also stated that the conflict between Israel and Gaza must end immediately, and that Israel should not occupy the enclave once the war concludes. Additionally, he expressed his dissatisfaction with the outcome of some of his initiatives in Gaza, particularly the planned closure of the US military's humanitarian pier off the coast of Gaza. ""I was hopeful that would be more successful,"" he said.President Biden dismissed concerns about his capability to serve another term, despite stumbling over a reference to Donald Trump early in the press conference.""I'm not in this for my legacy. I'm in this to complete the job I started,"" Biden asserted, emphasizing that his support among voters remained strong and that he would continue his campaign and secure victory.Regardless of any missteps, the president countered all implications that he was slowing down, exhibiting significant signs of decline, or struggling to lead effectively. However, he faced increasing pressure from politicians, public figures, and prominent members of the Democratic Party to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race .""My schedule has been full bore,"" he affirmed. ""So if I slow down and I cant get the job done, that's a sign that I shouldn't be doing it. But there's no indication of that yet — none.""""I'm determined on running but I think it's important that I allay fears — let them see me out there,"" he concluded, expressing his commitment to the campaign while acknowledging the need to address any apprehensions about his candidacy.President Biden has affirmed that his health remains robust and that he is open to undergoing an additional neurological examination to assess his cognitive abilities if his medical team advises it.The President disclosed that he has already undergone three rigorous neurological evaluations, with the most recent one taking place in February. He stated, ""I am in good shape,"" based on the feedback from his physicians. Currently, there are no recommendations from his doctors for him to undergo another such examination.(With agency inputs)","US President Joe Biden held his first solo press conference on Thursday.

Biden mistakenly refers to Zelenskiyy as 'Putin' at Nato event

During a crucial press conference on Thursday, US President Joe Biden , who faces significant scrutiny regarding his mental fitness, made a verbal slip that drew ridicule from former President Donald Trump .On his Truth Social platform, Trump sarcastically said, ""Crooked Joe begins his 'Big Boy' Press Conference with, 'I wouldn't have picked Vice President Trump to be vice president...Great job, Joe!""On Thursday, during a news conference aimed at addressing concerns about his age and ability to run for re-election, President Joe Biden, 81, inadvertently referred to his vice president, Kamala Harris , as ""Vice President Trump.""Biden said, ""Look, I wouldn't have picked Vice President Trump to be vice president if she was not qualified to be president. So start there,"" in response to a question from Reuters regarding his confidence in Harris.Earlier that day, at a high-stakes press conference following the Nato summit in Washington, Biden mistakenly referred to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiyy as ""President Putin,"" causing gasps from those in attendance. ""And now I want to hand it over to the president of Ukraine, who has as much courage as he has determination, ladies and gentlemen, President Putin,"" Biden said.He quickly corrected himself, saying, ""Going to beat President Putin, President Zelenskiyy. I am so focused on beating Putin.""These gaffes have fueled growing doubts among donors, supporters, and fellow Democrats about Biden's ability to defeat Republican Donald Trump in the November election and effectively lead the country for another four-year term. Biden's campaign has been struggling since his lacklustre debate performance against his 78-year-old Republican rival, Donald Trump.Thus far, 13 out of the 213 democrats in the House and one of the 51 democrats in the Senate have publicly called for the president to withdraw from the race. If Biden's performance at the press conference is unsatisfactory, more Democrats may voice their concerns publicly.","US President Joe Biden, 81, made a verbal slip that drew ridicule from former President Donald Trump.

US President Joe Biden's first solo press conference since November: Top quotes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-president-joe-bidens-first-solo-press-conference-since-november-top-quotes/articleshow/111673828.cms,"Here is what Biden said in the press briefing

After opening the news conference by talking about Nato and security for Ukraine, Biden shifted to discussing inflation and border security in the US, and negotiations for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas.

in the US, and negotiations for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas. The first question of Biden’s press conference was about him losing support among many of his fellow Democrats and key unions, and about Vice President Kamala Harris possibly replacing him on the ticket. Biden was at first defiant, saying the “UAW endorsed me, but go ahead,” meaning the United Autoworkers. But then he flubbed the answer, mixing up Harris and Trump: “I wouldn’t have picked Vice President Trump to be vice president if she wasn’t qualified.”

Biden was asked how it might hurt his place in the history books if he were to keep running and lose to Trump in November — but insisted he’s not concerned. Instead, his focus, he said, is continuing four more years of policies to grow the economy and help the middle class. “I’m not in this for my legacy,” Biden said. “I’m in this to complete the job I started.”

Biden says he never suggested he needs an earlier bedtime. The president told reporters that, in previous conversations, what he meant was “it’d be smarter to pace myself a little bit.” Biden also vowed that, ahead of his second debate with Trump in September, “I’m not going to be traveling 15 time zones. Pace myself. Pace myself,” he added.

Biden said the best way to reassure anyone who is concerned about him having another “bad night” is “the way I assure myself and that is: ‘Am I getting the job done?’” The president said “there’s no indication yet” that he’s slowing down on that front.

Biden’s press conference shifted largely from questions about if he’s up to continuing his reelection campaign to foreign policy. “There isn’t any world leader I’m not prepared to deal with,” the president said. He also vowed to maintain a hardline against Russian President Vladimir Putin: “If we allow Russia to succeed in Ukraine, they’re not stopping in Ukraine.

US President Joe Biden on Thursday held a solo press conference at the Nato summit , marking his first solo press appearance since November. His remarks coincided with Nato members extending support to Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion that began in February 2022. The United States has been Ukraine's most crucial partner in providing military assistance during the conflict.Although the primary subject matter of the engagement was just-concluded Nato summit, Americans of all hues and interested parties across the world watched every word and gesture to determine if the 81-year President retains the cognitive ability to run for a second term in the White House.","Biden says he never suggested he needs an earlier bedtime.

'Miracle baby' found alive on highway after surviving hurricane Beryl,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/miracle-baby-found-alive-on-highway-after-surviving-hurricane-beryl/articleshow/111667620.cms,"In an extraordinary survival story, a one-year-old has been discovered alive by the side of a Louisiana highway following a two-day search. The child had gone missing during the severe storms caused by Hurricane Beryl earlier this week. Officials are calling the boy a "" miracle baby "" due to his incredible endurance and survival in such harsh conditions, New York Post reported.Despite numerous insect bites, the toddler was found to be in good health, according to Calcasieu Parish Sheriff Gary ""Stitch"" Guillory, who shared the miraculous news with the media.The child's identity has not been released. He was feared dead after his older sibling, a four-year-old boy, was tragically found drowned in a lake behind the Interstate 10 welcome center near the Texas border.On Monday night, their mother, Aaliyah Jack, 25, was arrested in Meridian, Mississippi, which is approximately 350 miles away from Lake Charles, where the siblings were found. This underscores the remoteness of the small city in southwestern Louisiana, located about 143 miles east of Houston, Texas, 206 miles west of New Orleans, and just 37 miles from the Texas boundary.A truck driver discovered the toddler crawling along a major road and immediately contacted law enforcement, as reported by the Mirror US. Sheriff Guillory expressed immense relief at the boy's discovery during a press briefing, stating, ""We consider this one-year-old our miracle baby because he was still alive.""He added, ""This child spent two days outside in the elements on the side of the highway. Thank God that trucker saw him."" Hurricane Beryl hit eastern Texas early on Monday, complicating the search with intermittent heavy rain and strong winds.Authorities were preparing to search the waters near where the older boy was found on Tuesday morning when they received the 911 call about the baby.While investigating the death of the four-year-old, authorities learned he had last been seen with his mother on Saturday, and his baby brother had been with them. The family is from Lake Charles.The circumstances of the older boy's death and why the mother fled, leaving her one-year-old son behind, remain unclear. After her arrest on Monday night, Kayla Vincent, a spokeswoman for the sheriff, said the only charge pending against the mother as of Wednesday afternoon was failure to report a missing child.Vincent mentioned no other charges were being pursued against the mother, but the investigation is ongoing. She is to be extradited to Louisiana from Mississippi, with a $300,000 bond set by a Louisiana judge.Online booking records were not available on Wednesday, and it was unclear whether the mother had secured legal representation. Autopsy reports for the four-year-old are pending, and his official cause of death has not yet been disclosed.","A truck driver discovered the toddler crawling along a major road and immediately contacted law enforcement.

The appeal was filed after the Election Commission of Pakistan rejected the SIC's plea for awarding its share in the 70 reserved seats in the National Assembly and another 156 in the four provincial assemblies.The SIC became prominent after Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party-supported candidates joined the party after winning the elections as jailed former prime minister Imran Khan's PTI could not contest the polls and was not eligible to claim the seats reserved for women and minorities.The seats were awarded to the winning parties based on proportional representation .The ECP had rejected the SIC plea for reserved seats as it had not contested the elections and got strength when PTI-backed independently elected candidates joined after the elections.Its appeal against the ECP decision in the Peshawar High Court was also turned down. Subsequently, the party challenged it in the Supreme Court.A 13-member bench headed by Chief Justice Faez Isa and comprising justices Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Munib Akhtar, Yahya Afridi, Aminuddin Khan, Jamal Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Ayesha Malik, Athar Minallah, Syed Hasan Rizvi, Shahid Waheed, Irfan Saadat Khan and Naeem Akhtar Afghan heard the case.Chief Justice Isa announced at the conclusion of the proceedings that the panel decided to reserve the verdict for mutual consultation.He did not give any date for the announcement of the judgment, which is expected this week.""We will see if a short judgment can be announced,"" the chief justice remarked while reserving the judgment.Earlier, the Supreme Court on May 6 in a major relief to the PTI, suspended the Peshawar High Court's decision about rejecting the SIC plea.Following the ruling, the ECP on May 14 suspended the victory notifications of 77 candidates who belonged to other parties and were declared successful on the reserved seats.The final ruling by the top court in the case would decide the fate of those 77 reserved seats. Though it may not change the current power structure, the changes in the overall number game in the assemblies may impact the law-making process in the country.The problem of the PTI began when just before the general election, it was deprived of its symbol of cricket bat by the ECP for failure to hold the intra-party election according to its Constitution. It forced PTI to field its candidates as independents.PTI candidates joined the SIC to secure a due share in the reserved seats, but the ECP rejected the SIC plea for reserved seats by saying that it had not contested elections and also did not provide a list of candidates for the reserved seats within the stipulated time, which was mandatory.",Pakistan's Supreme Court on Tuesday reserved its judgment in a key petition by the opposition Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) party.
