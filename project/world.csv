'Unfair'

BRUSSELS: Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday urged US leader Joe Biden to attend a June peace summit in Switzerland, as he accused Russia's Vladimir Putin of trying to derail the gathering.Zelenskyy's appeal came as he locked in a commitment from Belgium to supply 30 F-16 fighter jets by 2028, on the latest leg of a whistlestop tour to rally Western support.Ukraine is pushing to whip up attendance at the peace conference next month where it hopes to win broad international backing for its vision of the terms needed to end Russia's war.But the meeting threatens to be overshadowed if key Ukraine backer Biden -- who is locked in campaigning against Donald Trump and has given no sign he would participate -- ultimately stays away.""If (Biden) is not present, it will be just like applauding Putin: personally applauding and doing so standing,"" Zelenskyy said at a press conference alongside Belgium's Alexander De Croo.The Ukrainian leader said that Putin was ""very scared"" of the peace summit and was trying to derail the event set for June 15-16.""He has been trying to thwart this summit and continues to do so,"" said Zelenskyy, who has ruled out Russian participation in the gathering.Moscow meanwhile dismissed the proposed peace summit without Russia as ""absurd"".""The conference is, from our point of view, completely hopeless in terms of finding some ways to resolve the conflict around Ukraine,"" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.Zelenskyy's latest tour of allies comes as Ukraine is struggling to hold back a Russian ground offensive in the Kharkiv region, where Moscow recently has made its largest territorial gains in 18 months.Belgium's commitment of fighter jets -- which it hopes to start delivering by year's end -- came a day after Spain promised Zelenskyy one billion euros in support on a visit to Madrid, and before he heads to Portugal later Tuesday.The pledge was made as part of a bilateral security and long-term support accord signed by Zelenskyy and De Croo, the latest in a string of similar Ukrainian deals with Western backers.The security agreement, Zelenskyy said, ""includes at least 977 million euros in Belgian military aid to Ukraine this year,"" in addition to a commitment of support over the next 10 years.""But let me be very clear, more needs to be done,"" De Croo said, in a message to Western allies.""It needs to be done faster, and it needs to be done better. Ukraine can only push back the invader if we provide more and if we provide better arms.""The pledges of further support for Kyiv come as pressure mounts on key allies such as the United States and Germany to let Ukraine hit targets in Russia using weaponry they are supplying.Washington and Berlin have refused to permit Kyiv to strike over the border out of fear that it could drag them closer to direct conflict with Moscow.""I think this is unfair,"" Zelenskyy said.""But we, and this is a fact, cannot risk the support of our partners -- that is why we are not using our partners' arms to attack Russian territory.""That's why we are asking: Please give us the permission to do that.""EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell threw his weight behind Kyiv's pleas.""You have to balance the risk of escalation and the need for Ukrainians to defend,"" Borrell said at a meeting of EU defence ministers across town in Brussels.That was echoed by Nato boss Jens Stoltenberg who insisted for the second day running that Ukraine had the right to strike ""legitimate military targets inside Russia.""But German's deputy defence minister Siemtje Moller reiterated that Berlin had taken a ""sovereign decision"" not to let Kyiv strike.And sitting next to Zelenskyy, even De Croo appeared unmoved as he said the weapons Belgium was supplying could only be used on ""Ukrainian territory"".",Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy urges US leader Joe Biden to attend a peace summit.

"Texas storms cut power to 1 million, some outages to last days",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/texas-storms-cut-power-to-1-million-some-outages-to-last-days/articleshow/110517535.cms,"A collapsed tree after a storm lies at Daniel Avenue and Athens Avenue in University Park, Texas.

High winds and heavy rains tore through storm-battered Texas Tuesday, grounding flights, flooding streets and leaving more than 1 million homes and businesses without power — some possibly for days.The storms, striking less than a week after deadly tornadoes ripped across North Texas, lashed the Dallas and Houston areas with winds that uprooted trees and toppled power lines. Traffic on highways slowed to a crawl, cars and trucks pulling onto shoulders to avoid wind-blown debris. As hail pounded rooftops, tornado sirens sounded across the region, with radio and TV stations urging residents to seek shelter.The damage to the electric grid was so extreme that some equipment will need to be rebuilt rather than repaired, a spokesman of utility Oncor Electric Delivery Co said.“These storms produced baseball-sized hail, winds in excess of 80 miles per hour and a significant amount of cloud-to-ground lightning,” Oncor’s Grant Cruise said at a press conference. Some outages, he warned, would likely last for days.The storms arrived as Houston, the nation’s fourth-largest city, is still recovering from a May 16 windstorm that tore windows from downtown office towers and smashed them on the pavement below. Tuesday’s storms battered the same damaged skyscrapers, with more reports of falling glass downtown, Houston Office of Emergency Management representative Brent Taylor said in an interview.Tuesday’s rough weather led to 523 delayed flights and 59 cancellations at the city’s George Bush Intercontinental Airport, according to aviation tracker FlightAware LLC. Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, a hub for American Airlines Inc., fared worse, with 866 delays and 450 cancellations.“The winds were very strong, it got dark, the rain was coming down very hard,” Mary Benton, a representative for Houston Mayor John Whitmire, said by phone. “It hit Houston pretty quickly.”Several Dallas-area nursing homes were running on backup generators, said Dallas County Judge Clay Lewis Jenkins.Heavy rains will likely drench the Dallas-Fort Worth area overnight, with the potential for another 1 to 3 inches falling, said forecaster Bryan Jackson with the US Weather Prediction Center. Wednesday may see a lull, with localized severe storms popping up, but Thursday looks like another wild day throughout the southern Plains and Texas, he said.“It is a real active pattern,” Jackson said.In addition to the storms, high temperatures and humidity will bear down across southern Texas, pushing heat index values as high as 110F (43C).Unsettled spring weather has produced strong storms across the central US, from the Plains and Midwest to the South. Warm, moist air flowing north from the Gulf of Mexico is colliding with cool, drier air moving south from Canada as well as storms crossing the Rocky Mountains. April produced 384 tornado reports around the US, the second highest count on record, according to the US National Centers for Environmental Information.Tuesday’s intense weather followed a weekend of heavy tornado activity in Texas. On Sunday, at least 17 people died after twisters struck parts of Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas. Half the fatalities occurred after one of the tornadoes tore through North Texas.A large area in the Texas Panhandle, including Lubbock, was under a tornado watch Tuesday, meaning the deadly storms could occur, the National Weather Service said.","Storms hit less than a week after deadly tornadoes ripped across North Texas.

Hush money trial: Prosecutor urges jury to convict Trump using 'common sense',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hush-money-trial-prosecutor-urges-jury-to-convict-trump-using-common-sense/articleshow/110516536.cms,"NEW DELHI: Prosecutors urged jurors on Tuesday to use their ""common sense"" and convict Donald Trump as the first criminal trial of a former president reached its dramatic final phase.As both sides concluded their closing arguments, the stage is set for the 12-member panel to begin deliberating on Wednesday.With less than six months before an in which Trump seeks to return to the White House, the stakes are high both for the 77-year-old and for the country.Trump stands accused of falsifying business records to reimburse his ex-lawyer, Michael Cohen , for a $130,000 payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels , fearing her account of an alleged sexual encounter could jeopardize his 2016 presidential campaign against Hillary Clinton.Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass made the final push for a guilty verdict , countering Trump's defense lawyer, Todd Blanche, who called for acquittal, asserting the case against Trump was based on lies.Steinglass stated that Daniels's story about her 2006 affair with the married Trump was the motive for the alleged crime, but emphasized, ""The case at its core is about a conspiracy and a cover-up"" on the eve of an election. ""The defendant's intent to defraud could not be any clearer,"" he added.Blanche urged the jury to acquit Trump, suggesting the only outcome should be a ""very quick and easy not guilty verdict."" He argued that Cohen, the prosecution's star witness, was motivated by ""outright hatred"" for his former boss, and had lied on the witness stand.""He told you a number of things on that witness stand that were lies, pure and simple,"" Blanche said.During a break before the court reconvened for a rare evening session on Tuesday, Trump took to social media to dismiss the proceedings as ""boring."" Speaking to reporters earlier, Trump called it a ""very dangerous day for America.""""We have a rigged court case that should have never been brought,"" he said, with three of his five children—Don Jr, Eric, and Tiffany—standing behind him.Blanche argued that Trump did not closely inspect all the invoices that crossed his desk. However, Steinglass countered that there was a substantial amount of corroborating evidence beyond Cohen's testimony.""They want to make this case about Michael Cohen,"" Steinglass said. ""This case is about Donald Trump and whether he should be accountable for causing false entries in his own business records and whether he did that to cover up his own election violations.""Polls show Trump neck and neck with President Joe Biden, and the verdict will inject new tension into the White House race. Speaking on behalf of the Biden campaign outside court, actor Robert De Niro berated Trump as a ""clown"" intent on destroying the country. De Niro's unexpected press conference—amid a noisy backdrop of pro-Trump protesters and car alarms—appeared aimed at countering Trump's dominance of TV news channels.As the first former or sitting president under criminal indictment, Trump also faces charges in separate cases, including accusations of mishandling classified documents and attempting to overthrow the 2020 election. The hush money case, featuring over 20 witnesses and gripping testimony from Daniels and Cohen, is likely the only one to go to trial before election day.If convicted, Trump faces up to four years in prison on each of 34 counts, but as a first-time offender, he is unlikely to receive jail time. A conviction would not bar him from appearing on the ballot in November or moving back into the White House.Trump chose not to testify in his defense, instead staging daily tirades against ""corrupt"" Judge Juan Merchan and claiming the trial was a Democratic Party ploy to keep him off the campaign trail. The jury must reach a unanimous verdict; otherwise, a single holdout could lead to a mistrial.","Prosecutors urge jurors to use their ""common sense"" and convict Donald Trump.

Israel's Rafah operation not a major offensive: US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israels-rafah-operation-not-a-major-offensive-us/articleshow/110516106.cms,"WASHINGTON: The White House on Tuesday provided the most complete definition yet of what it considers a ""major ground operation "" in Rafah that could trigger a change in United States policy toward Israel, and said Israel's actions there have not yet reached that level.""We have not seen them smash into Rafah - we have not seen them go in with large units, large numbers of troops in columns and formations in some sort of coordinated maneuver against multiple targets on the ground. That is a major ground operation. We have not seen that,"" White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters at a briefing.Israel's three-week-old Rafah offensive stirred renewed outrage and prompted an outcry from global leaders after an airstike on Sunday that Gaza officials said killed at least 45 people when a blaze ignited in a tent camp in a western district.The Biden administration has repeatedly warned Israel against launching a large-scale military offensive in Rafah, a city in southern Gaza packed with refugees who followed Israel's previous orders to evacuate there. President Joe Biden himself publicly warned Israel this month that the U.S. would stop supplying it with weapons if Israeli forces conduct a major invasion there without a credible plan to protect civilians.Israel told around one million Palestinian civilians displaced by the almost eight-month-old war to evacuate to Al-Mawasi when it launched its incursion in Rafah in early May. Around that many have fled Rafah since then, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA reported on Tuesday.Asked about reports that Israeli forces have moved into central Rafah, Kirby said ""my understanding is, and I believe the Israelis have spoken to this, that they are moving along something called the Philadelphia corridor, which is on the outskirts of the town, not in the town proper.""""We have not seen a major ground operation and these tanks are moving along a corridor that they have told us previously that they would use on the outskirts of the town to try to put pressure on Hamas,"" Kirby said.The World Court last week ordered Israel to immediately halt its military assault on Rafah, in a landmark emergency ruling in South Africa's case accusing Israel of genocide.Israel said it had targeted two senior Hamas operatives in a compound and had not intended to cause civilian casualties.""I don't know how anybody could dispute that they were trying to go after Hamas in a targeted precise way,"" Kirby said, adding that the U.S. would wait for the results of Israel's investigation into the incident.The U.S. is by far the biggest supplier of weapons to Israel, and it accelerated deliveries after the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attacks.Rafah was a major entry point for humanitarian relief before Israel stepped up its military offensive on the Gaza side of the border earlier this month and seized control of the crossing from the Palestinian side.More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, Gaza's health ministry says. Israel launched its air and ground war after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.",The Biden administration has repeatedly warned Israel against launching a large- scale military offensive in Rafah.

""If these serious consequences occur in Europe, how will the United States behave, bearing in mind our parity in the field of strategic weapons?""""It's hard to say - do they want a global conflict?""Putin said Ukrainian strikes on Russia with long-range weapons would need Western satellite, intelligence and military help - so the West would be directly involved. He said sending French troops to Ukraine would be a step towards a global conflict.Speaking of NATO members in Europe, Putin said that small countries there ""should be aware of what they are playing with"", as they had small land areas and very dense populations.""This is a factor that they should keep in mind before talking about striking deep into Russian territory,"" Putin said.RUSSIAN ADVANCES TRIGGER DEBATE IN WESTRussia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine touched off the worst breakdown in relations with the West for 60 years, and the crisis is escalating into what diplomats say is its most dangerous phase to date.The invasion has caused the deaths of tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilians, driven millions to flee abroad, and reduced neighbourhoods and whole cities to rubble.Russia, which controls 18% of Ukraine, is advancing and has opened a new front in the Kharkiv region, triggering a debate in the West about what else it can do after giving Kyiv hundreds of billions of dollars in aid, weapons and intelligence.Western leaders and Ukraine have played down Russia's warnings about the risk of a broader war involving Russia, the world's biggest nuclear power, and NATO, the world's most powerful military alliance led by the United States.Ukraine says it should be able to hit behind Russian lines, including against Russian sovereign territory, to fight back.But Russian officials say Moscow's patience is wearing thin after repeated Ukrainian attacks on Russian cities, oil refineries, and, in recent days, even against elements of its nuclear early warning system.Asked by Russian state television about the legitimacy of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Putin said the only legitimate authority in Ukraine now was parliament, and that its head should be given power.Zelenskiy has not faced an election despite the expiry of his term due to martial law which was imposed after the invasion.","Vladimir Putin says NATO members in Europe are playing with fire by proposing to let Ukraine use Western weapons to strike deep inside Russia.

Nawaz elected PML-N president on day Pakistan commemorates anniversary of nuke test conducted during his term as PM,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/nawaz-elected-pml-n-president-on-day-pak-commemorates-anniv-of-nuke-test-conducted-during-his-term-as-pm/articleshow/110509234.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s three-time former prime minister Nawaz Sharif was re-elected president of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) on Tuesday, six years after he was forced to quit the post after a Supreme Court ruling. His unopposed at the party’s general council meeting came on a day that was declared a public holiday by his younger brother, PM Shehbaz Sharif , to commemorate the 26anniversary of Pakistan’ nuclear tests , conducted during Nawaz Sharif’s second term as PM.Pakistan conducted the tests on May 28, 1998, almost three weeks after India tested its devices, in Chaghi hills of southwestern Balochistan province, making it the seventh nuclear nation in the world and the first Muslim state to have a nuclear arsenal.While Nawaz was at peak of his popularity in May 1998, he could not celebrate the first anniversary of the nuclear tests following his ouster from office in Oct 1998 by General Pervez Musharraf in a military coup.The anniversary is being commemorated for the first time in 26 years, coinciding with his re-election as PML-N president . He took the party’s reins back from Shehbaz, who had stepped down on May 13, paving the way for the 74-year-old party founder, to be elected again.Shehbaz hailed Nawaz, who returned to Pakistan in Oct 2023 after a four-year self-imposed exile in UK, for the nuclear tests, which he said ensured “credible minimum deterrence”. In a post on X, he said: “On this historic day in 1998, then-PM Nawaz Sharif demonstrated bold leadership by rejecting nerve-wracking pressures and inducements to make Pakistan a nuclear-armed nation.” He also paid tribute to ex-prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who, he said, was the founder of Pakistan’s nuclear programme, for his “strategic foresight and unwavering commitment to the cause”.Shehbaz was elected PML-N president in March 2018, months after the Supreme Court disqualified Nawaz for life in the Panama Papers case. Weeks later, an apex court bench also barred from heading a political party.","Pakistan conducted the tests on May 28, 1998, almost three weeks after India tested its devices.

"'We have nothing.' As Israel attacks Rafah, Palestinians are living in tents and searching for food",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/we-have-nothing-as-israel-attacks-rafah-palestinians-are-living-in-tents-and-searching-for-food/articleshow/110508408.cms,"DEIR AL-BALAH: The tent camps stretch more than 16 kilometers (10 miles) along Gaza's coast, filling the beach and sprawling into empty lots, fields and streets. Families dig trenches to use as toilets. Fathers search for food and water. Children dig through garbage and wrecked buildings for wood or cardboard for their mothers to burn for cooking.Over the past three weeks, Israel's offensive in Rafah has sent nearly a million Palestinians fleeing the southern Gaza city. Most have already been displaced multiple times during Israel's nearly 8-month-old war in Gaza, which is aimed at destroying Hamas but has devastated the territory and caused what the United Nations says is a near-famine.The situation has been worsened by a plunge in the amount of food, fuel and other supplies reaching the UN and other aid groups to distribute to the population. Palestinians, who relied in part on humanitarian aid even before the war, have largely been on their own to find the basics for survival.""The situation is tragic. You have 20 people in the tent, with no clean water, no electricity. We have nothing,"" said Mohammad Abu Radwan, a schoolteacher with his wife, six children and other extended family.""I can't explain what it feels like living through constant displacement , losing your loved ones,"" he said. ""All of this destroys us mentally.""Abu Radwan fled Rafah soon after the Israeli assault on the city began on May 6 as bombardment neared the house where he was sheltering. He and three other families paid $1,000 for donkey carts to take them to the outskirts of Khan Younis, about 6 kilometers (3.6 miles) away. It took a day of living outside before they could assemble the materials for a makeshift tent. Next to the tent, they dug a toilet trench, hanging blankets and old clothes around it for privacy.Families usually have to buy the wood and tarps for their tents, which can run up to $500, not counting ropes, nails and the cost of transporting the material, the humanitarian group Mercy Corps said.Israeli authorities controlling all entry points into Gaza have been letting greater numbers of private commercial trucks into the territory, the UN and aid workers say. More fruits and vegetables are found in markets, and prices on some have fallen, Palestinians say.Still, most homeless Palestinians can't afford them. Many in Gaza have not received salaries for months and their savings are depleting. Even those who have money in the bank often can't withdraw it because there is so little physical cash in the territory. Many turn to black market exchanges that charge up to 20% to give cash for transfers from bank accounts.Meanwhile, humanitarian convoys with free supplies have fallen to nearly their lowest levels in the war, the UN says.Previously, the UN was receiving several hundred trucks a day. That has dropped to an average of 53 trucks a day since May 6, according to the latest figures from the UN humanitarian office on Friday. Some 600 trucks a day are needed to stave off starvation, according to USAID.In the past three weeks, most of the incoming aid has entered through two crossings from Israel in northern Gaza and via a U.S.-built floating pier taking deliveries by sea. But that pier has suspended operations after damage from rough seas, three U.S. officials told The Associated Press on Tuesday.The two main crossings in the south, Rafah from Egypt and Kerem Shalom from Israel, are either not operating or are largely inaccessible for the UN because of fighting nearby. Israel says it has been letting hundreds of trucks through Kerem Shalom, but the UN has only been able to collect about 170 of them on the Gaza side over the past three weeks.Entry of fuel has fallen to about a third of what it was before the Rafah offensive , according to the UN That makes it more difficult to keep hospitals, bakeries, water pumps and aid trucks working.The American humanitarian group Anera ""is having difficulty distributing what we are able to bring in to the people who need it because there's so little fuel for trucks,"" spokesperson Steve Fake said.Most of those fleeing Rafah have poured into a humanitarian zone declared by Israel that is centered on Muwasi, a largely barren strip of coastal land. The zone was expanded north and east to reach the edges of Khan Younis and the central town of Deir al-Balah, both of which have also filled with people.""As we can see, there is nothing 'humanitarian' about these areas,"" said Suze van Meegen, head of operations in Gaza for the Norwegian Refugee Council, who is in the Rafah area.Much of the humanitarian zone has no charity kitchens or food market, and it has no functioning hospitals, only a few field hospitals and even smaller medical tents that can't handle emergencies. They pass out painkillers and antibiotics if they have them, according to Mercy Corps.The Muwasi area has no water resources or sewage systems. With human waste deposited near the tents and garbage piling up, many people suffer from gastrointestinal diseases such as hepatitis and diarrhea, as well as skin allergies and lice, Mercy Corps said.One aid worker who fled Rafah said he was lucky and could afford to rent a house in Deir al-Balah. ""You can't walk"" in the town from all the tents that have arisen, he said, speaking on condition of anonymity because his agency had not authorized him to speak. Many people he sees in the street are yellow with jaundice.Israel says its offensive in Rafah is vital to its war aim of destroying Hamas in Gaza after the group's Oct. 7 attack, in which militants killed some 1,200 people and abducted around 250 others from southern Israel. Israel's campaign in Gaza triggered by the attack has killed some 36,000 people, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.Aid groups have warned for months that an attack on Rafah will worsen Gaza's humanitarian disaster. So far, Israel's operations have been short of its planned all-out invasion, though fighting has expanded from the eastern parts of Rafah to its central districts.A strike Sunday hit a tent camp in a western part of Rafah, causing a large fire and killing at least 45 people, according to health officials. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged a ""tragic mistake"" had occurred.From the exodus the assault has caused, satellite photos taken by Planet Labs PBC on May 24 show dense new tent camps running the length of the coast from just north of Rafah to outside Deir al-Balah. The tents and shelters are densely packed in mazes of corrugated metal and plastic sheets, with blankets and bedsheets draped over sticks for privacy.Tamer Saeed Abu'l Kheir said he goes out at 6 a.m. every day to find water, usually returning around noon to the tent outside Khan Younis where he and nearly two dozen relatives live. His three children, aged 4 to 10, are always sick, but he said he has to send them to collect wood for the cooking fire.He worries they'll come across unexploded bombs in the wrecked houses.His aging father has trouble moving and uses the bathroom in a bucket, and Abu'l Kheir has to regularly pay to transport him to the nearest hospital for kidney dialysis.""Wood costs money, water costs money, everything costs money,"" said his wife, Leena Abu'l Kheir. She broke down in sobs. ""I'm afraid I'll wake up one day and I've lost my children, my mother, my husband, my family.""","Israel's offensive in Rafah has sent nearly a million Palestinians fleeing the southern Gaza city.

United Airlines flight aborted after engine catches fire at Chicago airport,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/united-airlines-flight-aborted-after-engine-catches-fire-at-chicago-airport/articleshow/110480890.cms,"NEW DELHI: A United Airlines flight was forced to abort takeoff at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport on Monday afternoon when one of its engines caught fire, sending thick plumes of smoke gushing from one of the wings. The incident occurred on United Flight 2091, an Airbus 320, which was scheduled to fly to Seattle.The aircraft was on the taxiway preparing for takeoff when the engine burst into flames. This sudden malfunction prompted immediate action from the flight crew and airport emergency services. A total of 148 passengers and five crew members were onboard at the time. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and United Airlines provided separate statements confirming the details of the incident.As the plane was towed back to a gate, passengers were evacuated safely. Footage taken by Ivan Paloalto, a passenger on the flight, showed thick smoke billowing from one of the wings. Paloalto described hearing an explosion just as the plane was nearing takeoff. “I felt the impact on my window. As I looked, the engine was on fire and smoke was coming out,” he recounted to Storyful.In response to the fire, the FAA temporarily halted arrivals into O’Hare, one of the busiest airports in the United States, especially during the Memorial Day weekend. Regular operations resumed after sometime, minimizing further disruptions.An airport spokesman described the incident as an ""emergency situation"" that was resolved ""safely."" United Airlines assured that there were no injuries reported and commended the quick response from first responders who “immediately addressed” the engine issue. Passengers deplaned “normally,” according to the airline. “We are working to make alternative travel arrangements for customers,” United said in their statement.This incident is part of a broader pattern of travel disruptions over the Memorial Day weekend. In addition to the engine fire at O’Hare, travelers at JFK International Airport faced a temporary ground stop on Monday as officials monitored powerful thunderstorms moving through the area. These combined issues underscored the challenges faced by travelers during one of the busiest travel periods of the year.The emergency response at O’Hare highlights the rigorous safety protocols in place to handle such incidents effectively, ensuring passenger safety remains paramount. While the incident was undoubtedly alarming for those onboard, the swift actions of the flight crew and emergency responders averted what could have been a far more serious situation.","A United Airlines flight was forced to abort takeoff at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport on Monday afternoon.

If Congress moves forward on it, the accusation could lead to Boluarte's ouster.Peru's increasingly rocky politics has claimed several of Boluarte's predecessors in recent years, with lawmakers often playing the leading role in launching removal proceedings against the Andean nation's presidents.Later on Monday, Prime Minister Gustavo Adrianzen derided the complaint as ""improper, unconstitutional and illegal"" persecution, in comments made on local broadcaster Canal N.Adrianzen added that the president will not be distracted by ""political noise.""Boluarte, a former vice president, has already faced questioning and police raids over her use of several Rolex watches and other jewelry that seem at odds with her modest public salary.She has denied wrongdoing in the case, arguing that the luxury goods were loaned to her by a local governor.The graft complaint marks the second constitutional complaint facing Boluarte during her less than two-year-old administration.Last November, the attorney general filed a complaint against the president over her handling of deadly social unrest after the ouster of her predecessor.In late 2022, then-President Pedro Castillo tried to illegally dissolve Congress before a vote to remove him from office. His ouster and subsequent arrest plunged the country into weeks of angry and sometimes violent protests that claimed at least 40 lives.","The complaint accuses President Dina Boluarte of receiving a bribe.

Dmitry Medvedev warns of World War if US strikes Russian targets in Ukraine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/medvedev-warns-of-world-war-if-us-strikes-russian-targets-in-ukraine/articleshow/110467333.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has issued a stark warning that any US attack on Russian targets in Ukraine would inevitably trigger a global conflict. Medvedev, who currently serves as Deputy Chair of Russia ’s Security Council, made this statement following comments by Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski. Sikorski claimed that Washington would strike Russian targets if Moscow resorted to using nuclear weapons in Ukraine.In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Medvedev criticized Sikorski, saying, “Apparently, [he] has decided to scare his masters.” Medvedev suggested that Washington, unlike Warsaw, has been more cautious and has not made such threats publicly. He added, “Americans hitting our targets means starting a world war , and a Foreign Minister, even of a country like Poland, should understand that.”Medvedev also referenced Polish President Andrzej Duda’s recent remarks about Poland’s willingness to host US nuclear weapons if offered the opportunity under Nato’s sharing mechanism. He warned that in the event of a nuclear confrontation, “Warsaw won’t be left out, and will surely get its share of radioactive ash,” questioning if this is the outcome the Polish leadership truly desires.Sikorski, in an interview with the Guardian, expressed skepticism about the likelihood of a Russian nuclear strike in Ukraine. He claimed that the US has warned Russia that any nuclear explosion, even without casualties, would result in a full-scale conventional strike on all Russian positions in Ukraine. Sikorski described this warning as a “credible threat” and suggested that China and India have also cautioned Russia against nuclear escalation.The Polish diplomat further argued that Ukraine’s Western allies should allow Kiev to use their weapons to target military sites within Russia, saying, “Apart from not using nuclear weapons, [Moscow] does not limit itself much.” Sikorski urged the EU not to fear escalation and to avoid self-imposed restrictions in the Ukraine conflict, thereby keeping Moscow uncertain about the West’s next moves.While the US and its allies have accused Moscow of nuclear saber-rattling, Russian President Vladimir Putin insisted in March that Russia has never considered using nuclear weapons during the Ukraine conflict. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov reiterated that Russia’s nuclear doctrine permits the use of such weapons only if the country’s existence is threatened, describing them as a “farewell weapon.”In his annual address to the Federal Assembly in late February, Putin emphasized that Russia’s nuclear arsenal is in a state of “complete readiness for guaranteed deployment.” Earlier this month, Putin ordered tactical nuclear weapons exercises in the Southern Military District, which borders Ukraine. These exercises were intended as a warning to the US and its allies, following what Russia perceived as escalatory rhetoric from the West.",Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has issued a stark warning that any US attack on Russian targets in Ukraine would inevitably trigger a global conflict.

This is the time to stop him by voting him out once and for all.""If Trump returns to the White House, he said, Americans could see the civil liberties they take for granted evaporate as well as the end of elections.""If he gets in, I can tell you right now, he will never leave,"" said DeNiro.Fanone and Dunn delivered emotional remarks, saying violence at the Capitol was fueled by Trump's lies that the 2020 election was stolen. The speakers were heckled by a Trump supporter as pro-Trump demonstrators chanted in the background.Trump campaign officials said the De Niro event showed desperation in the Biden camp.Spokesman Steven Cheung, taking the podium shortly afterwards, said the Biden camp was in ""complete freakout mode"" over Trump's resilience despite the multiple criminal cases against him.""Joe Biden is losing nationally,"" said Jason Miller, another Trump spokesperson. ""President Trump's numbers continue to rise. And the best that Biden can do is roll out a washed up actor.""A Reuters/Ipsos poll last week found the two men effectively tied among registered voters.In his most biting comments, De Niro spoke of Trump through the lens of the largely democratic city whose voters know Trump well and roundly rejected him at the polls.""We New Yorkers used to tolerate him when he was just another grubby real estate hustler masquerading as a big shot, a two-bit playboy lying his way into the tabloids,"" he said. ""A clown...No one took him seriously. They take him seriously now.""","Actor Robert De Niro called Donald Trump a "" clown "" who is bent on destroying American democracy.

Former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif set to be re-elected as PML-N president after six years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/former-pakistan-pm-nawaz-sharif-set-to-be-re-elected-as-pml-n-president-after-six-years/articleshow/110488540.cms,"LAHORE: Three-time former prime minister Nawaz Sharif is set to be re-elected as the President of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz ( PML-N ) party here on Tuesday, six years after losing the post following a Supreme Court ruling in the Panama Papers case. The Dawn newspaper reported that the General Council meeting is set to take place at a local hotel. It is likely that the 74-year-old veteran politician, who returned to Pakistan in October last year after a four-year self-imposed exile in the UK, will be elected unopposed even though as many as 11 party members have received the nomination papers for the top post, the report said.The PML-N had earlier announced convening the general council meeting on May 11 but it was postponed to coincide with the celebration of 26 years of Pakistan becoming a nuclear power, the report said.PML-N Punjab president Rana Sanaullah, while addressing a press conference, hinted that the elder Sharif would be elected without a contest.Responding to a question if others were contesting against the former premier, Sanaullah said if any party member wanted to contest against him, they should come forward.When asked why the party didn't adopt a democratic process to vote for a new president, Sanaullah said the party was a ""servant of power corridors and it was Nawaz Sharif who made it a party of the public"". He added that after Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, it was Nawaz Sharif who ""made the party vibrant"".Replying to another question on why Nawaz Sharif wasn't active in politics after the February 8 general elections, Sanaullah said the former PM is not angry with anyone and he is active in the party. ""All major decisions of the party and government are taken by him,"" he added.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had earlier this month resigned as the PML-N president citing the ""unjust"" disqualification of the party supremo and his elder brother Nawaz Sharif from the PM Office.Shehbaz, 72, said that it was time for the latter to ""resume his rightful place as the president of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz party.""The February 8 general elections had delivered a fractured mandate and the PML-N did not get a clear majority. It joined hands with the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) led by Bilawal Zardari Bhutto and other smaller parties to form the government at the federal level when Nawaz relinquished the post of prime minister in favour of Shehbaz.Much before that, in 2017, Nawaz had stepped down as the country's prime minister after the Supreme Court disqualified him for life from holding public office for not declaring a receivable salary.Following his trial in the Panama Papers case, the apex court, in February 2018, disqualified the PML-N supremo as the party's president.",Nawaz Sharif is set to be re-elected as the President of the ruling PML-N party.

The Chinese were working on Dasu hydropower project, which is about 300km north of Islamabad. The 4,320MW project is being constructed by China Gezhouba with funding from World Bank.“China attaches great importance to the important progress made by the Pakistani side on the investigation of the terrorist attack,” PTI quoted Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning. “China calls on countries in the region to strengthen counter-terrorism cooperation, root out all terrorist organisations, remove their breeding ground, and protect the common security and development interests of all countries.”Earlier, Pakistani military authorities claimed the suicide bomber was an Afghan national. At a press conference in Lahore Sunday, interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said: “The attack was completely operated from Afghanistan and planned to specifically target Chinese personnel in Pakistan.” He blamed the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and “hostile foreign intelligence agencies”.Pakistan’s allegation further strains bilateral ties as Islamabad continues to urge Kabul to take action against Pakistani Taliban based in Afghanistan.
