Shiv Sena sacks Rajesh Shah



NEW DELHI: Mihir Shah , the main accused in the Mumbai BMW hit-and-run case, was on Wednesday sent to police custody till July 16 by a local court. Mihir was arrested on Tuesday after a nearly 60-hour statewide manhunt.Mihir, who is the son of Shiv Sena leader Rajesh Shah , had been absconding since July 7 when he rammed his BMW into a two-wheeler in the Worli area of south-central Mumbai, resulting in the death of 45-year-old Kaveri Nakhwa , who was riding pillion, while her husband Pradeep survived with injuries.Seeking Mihir's custody, the police on Wednesday told Sewri court in Mumbai that they have to find out how many people helped (the accused) after the incident, and who all helped him to hide for so many days.The police further said they need to find out whether the accused has a driving license and what happened to the number plate of the car, which was discarded by the accused after the accident.The police had asked for 7-days custody of Mihir.Accused Mihir Shah's counsel told the court that the driver and Mihir were questioned after sitting in front of each other. The police have also taken the phone, the counsel said while questioning the need for police custody.The lawyer also said Mihir was taken to the accident spot on Tuesday where he narrated the entire incident.The advocate told the court that the driver's and Mihir's statement matched, adding that the police have not mentioned the grounds for the arrest of Mihir.Chilling details of the accident emerged in CCTV footage produced by the police in the court on Monday.The footage shows Kaveri Nakhwa being dragged by the BMW for 1.5 km before the car stopped.Mihir and his driver Rajrishi Bidawat pulled the woman off the bonnet, placed her on the road, and swapped seats. While reversing the car, Bidawat ran over the victim before fleeing.A Mumbai court has extended till July 11 the police custody of Bidawat in the case.Amid mounting criticism, Maharashtra chief minister Eknath Shinde, who heads the Shiv Sena, on Wednesday sacked Rajesh Shah, whose son Mihir Shah was allegedly involved in the BMW hit-and-run, as the party's deputy leader.A one-line notice by Shiv Sena secretary Sanjay More said Rajesh Shah has been relieved from the post of the party's deputy leader.Shah, however, continues to be a member of the Shiv Sena.Police have said that Shah actively ensured Mihir's escape after the car crash. He is currently out on bail.","Mihir Shah, the main accused in the Mumbai BMW hit-and-run case, was on Wednesday sent to police custody till July 16.

Reports in local newspapers and TV channels said the 15 victims found in the Ginsburg Lane residence of arrested couple Santhosh Katkoori and Dwaraka Gunda in Collin County were between 23 and 26 years of age.The Princeton Herald, meanwhile, published a statement by Katkoori's attorney, Jeremy Rosenthal, who disputed police claims of ""forced labour"" against the couple and two others.""These workers are in the IT field and nothing about this is forced labour,"" Rosenthal said.""Princeton police department has taken a 'shoot first, aim later' approach.

: Nehammer

Death of innocent civilians , whether in Ukraine or Gaza or anywhere else, is unacceptable, PM Modi said after talks with Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer as the shadow of Ukraine again loomed over what was the first visit by an Indian PM to Austria in 41 years.Recalling the 19th century Vienna Congress, which provided direction to peace and stability in Europe, Modi reiterated his message to Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2022 that this isn't the era of war.""We discussed in detail the ongoing conflicts around the world, whether it is the conflict in Ukraine or in West Asia. I have said before that this is not a time for war. Problems can't be solved on the battlefield. The loss of innocent lives, anywhere, is unacceptable,"" Modi said, adding India and Austria stressed on dialogue and diplomacy for early restoration of peace .We (India and Austria) are both ready to provide every possible cooperation to achieve this, PM Narendra Modi said.Interestingly, Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said he and Modi agreed the West and Global South must come together to further pursue the path chosen at the peace summit in Switzerland. ""Also, in this regard, India has a crucial role. The war in Ukraine must end,"" he said.While India did participate in the Switzerland summit at the senior official level, it did not endorse the joint declaration that called for making Ukraine's territorial integrity the basis of any peace process because Russia wasn't invited to the conference. India's position has been that enduring peace is possible only through a process that involves both sides.""Concerning the war in Ukraine, both leaders supported any collective effort to facilitate a peaceful resolution consistent with international law and the UN Charter. Both sides believe that achieving a comprehensive and lasting peace in Ukraine requires bringing together all stakeholders and a sincere and earnest engagement between the two parties to the conflict,"" a joint statement stated.""Chancellor Nehammer conveyed Austria's keen interest to engage with IMEC,"" the statement added.","Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said he and Modi agreed the West and Global South must come together to further pursue the path chosen at the peace summit in Switzerland.

Both are residents of Hanle village in Ladakh. They had illegally brought in the gold from across China. It is possible that the suspects, both of whom can speak Hindi, carried the gold from Nepal and travelled to China by road before crossing the LAC on foot to enter Ladakh, said a source.When intercepted by the ITBP team patrolling the general area comprising Chismule, Narbula Top, Zakle and Zakla to check attempts at infiltration and smuggling, not unusual for the summer season, the duo started running in direction of the LAC. The ITBP party gave them a chase, intercepted them and took them to its camp for questioning.The duo initially said that they were out collecting medicinal plants but a search of their belongings by ITBP, authorised by the Union home ministry, led to the recovery of 108 one-kg gold bars, besides Chinese food items, two mobile phones, one binocular, knives, torch and hammer, among other things.ITBP Act provides the force powers of customs on the border to check smuggling.After reporting the matter to the higher ups, the ITBP patrol party handed over the seized items and the suspects to the customs department for questioning and action as per law. The two suspects have been arrested.Investigations are on into the origins of the journey undertaken by the two suspects, who are being jointly interrogated by the civil police, intelligence agencies, customs and ITBP.The source told TOI that 2-3 more persons, suspected to be Chamba and Targy’s aides, have been picked up for questioning. The smuggling racket could involve more people with the gold intended for delivery outside Ladakh.Officials did not rule out past involvement of the apprehended duo in similar smuggling episodes. “Usually, smuggling a gold consignment as huge as 108 kg is risked after multiple successful attempts involving smaller quantities of contraband,” said an officer.","ITBP: This is the largest ever haul of smuggled international gold in the history of ITBP.

Mumbai BMW hit-and-run case: Juhu bar's license suspended for serving liquor to 23-year-old accused Mihir Shah,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mumbai-bmw-hit-and-run-case-juhu-bars-license-suspended-for-serving-liquor-to-23-year-old-accused-mihir-shah/articleshow/111613780.cms,"MUMBAI: The state excise administration has suspended the license of a Juhu-Tara Road bar that served hard liquor to Mihir Shah , who had not yet attained the age of 25 years. This is a basic criterion for serving or drinking whisky, rum, vodka, or similar Indian-made foreign liquors (IMFLs) in the state. The bar premises have been sealed until the next hearing.According to excise officials, Mihir, who is 23-years-old, is the culprit in the Worli hit-and-run case.The excise department also found various irregularities with the bar, named Don Giovanni Restaurant (Jobel Hospitalities Pvt Ltd bearing license number FL3,1489), aside from serving liquor to the underage Shah. Interestingly, on the cash memo or receipt, the bar was named Vice-Global Tapas Bar , located on Juhu Tara Road opposite Juhu Church Road.Following the Worli hit-and-run, this is the first action taken by the excise department, with more likely to follow. After the Porsche mishap in Pune, which killed two young students due to a drunk minor, around 60 bars across the Mumbai metropolitan region were closed for 5 to 10 days as punishment for not following closure timings, offering liquor to underage patrons, and not issuing a day's drinking permit to them. This action was part of the license suspension punishment.A notice issued by the suburban district collector to the Juhu bar on behalf of the state excise revealed that during interrogation, it was found that Dhruv Jawahar Dedhiya and three others, including Shah, had entered the bar premises and were served hard liquor. Mihir, son of Shiv Sena leader Rajesh Shah, has been prima facie found responsible for ramming his BMW into a couple's bike, killing a woman who was thrown a considerable distance from the accident spot due to the impact of his car.It may be mentioned here that post-Porsche incident in Pune, the state excise commissioner, Vijay Suryawanshi, had issued stringent directives to all bars and liquor shops across the state to install CCTVs to monitor their entrances and counters in real-time for underage customers and closure timings by state excise officials. However, the monitoring and vigilance of all the bars and shops in the city and the state seem to be far from meeting expectations.The license of the Juhu bar where Mihir had liquor has been suspended until the next hearing before the suburban collector on July 19, said excise officials. Other irregularities found in the investigations by the excise police included selling liquor to non-drinking permit holders in non-permitted areas, non-submission of licensed premises for inspection, mixing the permitted liquor serving area with the non-permitted restaurant zone, discrepancies in the liquor stock permitted versus non-permitted, lack of a liquor transport license for a certain amount of liquor stock, and wrongly naming the bar as Vice Global Tapas Bar on the receipts or cash memos. A hearing on the notice issued to the bar has been scheduled for July 19, and until then, bar operations have been sealed, said excise officials.","State excise administration has suspended the license of a Juhu-Tara Road bar.

Speaking to The Evening Standard, Maples, who recently celebrated her 60th birthday, said that the entire Trump family is backing his second presidential run.""I'm ready.I am available if needed and I'm not sitting back anymore,"" Maples said in her first interview in nearly a decade. She emphasised her desire to be more vocal and share her thoughts without fear of the consequences.Despite the legal challenges faced by her ex-husband, Maples remains steadfast in her support. When questioned about the lawsuit filed by writer Jean E Carroll, which resulted in Trump being found liable for sex abuse and defamation, Maples maintained her belief in his innocence. ""I do know my daughter's father well enough to know that he's never had to push himself on another person. He's always had women throw themselves on him instead,"" she asserted. ""I don't believe there was a crime done.""Maples also downplayed the significance of Trump's guilty verdict in the Manhattan hush money trial, where he was convicted of concealing a $130,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels. She criticised the focus on ""little sexy stories"" and instead emphasised the need to address the country's pressing issues, such as public safety.Sources indicated to The Evening Standard that Maples could envision herself as Trump's vice president , a position he is expected to announce in the coming week. When asked about this possibility, Maples laughed and said, ""Someone would have to ask my ex-husband about that."" She added, ""I'm open. I'm open to whatever way that I can serve.

They eventually wed in 1993 but separated by May 1997, with Maples receiving a $2 million settlement in 1999. Despite their past disagreements, which Maples attributed to the challenges of marriage, especially when played out in the media, she has forgiven Trump.In a 2018 appearance on NBC, Maples disclosed that she had advised Trump against running for president in the 1990s, citing the potential impact on their children, who were much younger at the time. However, the former couple appeared amicable and posed for photographs together at their daughter Tiffany's wedding in 2022.","Marla Maples, ex-US President Donald Trump's former wife, expressed her willingness to assist the ex-president's 2024 campaign and even entertained the idea of being his running mate.

South Korea to deploy 'StarWars' laser weapons to counter North Korean drones,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/first-in-world-south-korea-to-deploy-starwars-laser-weapons-to-counter-north-korean-drones/articleshow/111648259.cms,"South Korea is set to become the first nation globally to deploy and utilize laser weapons within its military this year, specifically designed to counter North Korean drones , as announced by the country's arms procurement agency on Thursday. South Korea has called its laser programme the ""StarWars project"".The South Korean military, in collaboration with Hanwha Aerospace , has developed these drone-zapping laser weapons, which are not only effective but also cost-efficient, with each shot costing a mere 2,000 won ($1.45).These weapons operate silently and invisibly, making them a formidable addition to the military's arsenal.The Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) said, ""Our country is becoming the first country in the world to deploy and operate laser weapons, and our military's response capabilities on North Korea's drone provocation will be further strengthened,"" highlighting the significance of these weapons in future battlefields.The laser weapons function by targeting and burning down the engines or other electrical components of flying drones using focused light beams for a duration of 10 to 20 seconds, as explained by a DAPA spokesperson during a briefing.In December, five North Korean drones breached South Korean airspace, prompting Seoul to deploy fighter jets and attack helicopters in an attempt to shoot them down. This incident marked the first such intrusion since 2017, highlighting the ongoing tensions between the two Koreas, which are technically still at war, with the Korean War having ended in an armistice rather than a peace treaty in 1953.The United States has acknowledged that both North and South Korea have violated the armistice governing their shared border by sending drones into each other's airspace.According to the US nonprofit think tank RAND Corporation, several countries, including South Korea, China, and the United Kingdom, are actively developing and deploying laser weapons, also known as directed energy weapons.These weapons are garnering significant interest due to their potential to counter the growing threat of unmanned systems, as well as their ability to target missiles in flight or satellites in orbit.","South Korea is set to become the first nation globally to deploy and utilize laser weapons within its military this year.

'Terror must fail': Nato sends F-16 jets to bolster Ukraine in new support effort,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/terror-must-fail-nato-sends-f-16-jets-to-bolster-ukraine-in-new-support-effort/articleshow/111647995.cms,"Nato allies on Wednesday at the 75th-anniversary summit in the US capital said that they have started transferring F-16 jets to Ukraine and stepped up promises of eventual membership for Kyiv. President Joe Biden welcomed 31 alliance leaders, urging them to match Russia 's military production, focusing on the defense of Nato territory. Biden said that Denmark and the Netherlands have begun sending US-made F-16 jets to Ukraine, fulfilling a key promise to Kyiv.He also mentioned new air defense systems and the periodic placement of long-range missiles in Germany.US secretary of state Antony Blinken said the F-16 transfer would ensure Putin realizes he ""will not outlast Ukraine"" and that continued aggression would only harm Russia further. This comes amid political uncertainty in the US, with Donald Trump leading Biden in polls and suggesting a peace settlement by forcing Ukraine to cede territory to Russia.Nato leaders, in a joint declaration, pledged 40 billion euros in military aid to Ukraine, aiming to increase predictability and counteract delays in US assistance . Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg stressed the need for a Ukrainian victory to end the war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed gratitude for the F-16s, asserting they would bring peace closer and ensure that ""terror must fail.""Zelenskyy in his X post said that, ""The new aircraft will bring just and lasting peace closer, demonstrating that terror must fail.""The summit aimed to ""Trump-proof"" Nato by enhancing the alliance's role in coordinating arms delivery to Ukraine rather than the United States. It also targeted China, expressing concern over its support to Russia, and highlighted Nato's increasing role in Asia by inviting Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand.The summit's language indicated Ukraine's ""irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including Nato membership."" However, concerns persist, led by Biden and German chancellor Olaf Scholz, about the risks of war with nuclear-armed Russia.Finnish President Alexander Stubb and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer affirmed their support for Ukraine, with Starmer stating Nato's unity against Russian aggression. The recent missile barrage by Russia on Ukraine, killing dozens and hitting a children's hospital, underscored the ongoing conflict.""We can -- and will -- defend every inch of Nato territory and we'll do it together,"" Biden told the North Atlantic Council.","Nato leaders pledge 40 billion euros in military aid to Ukraine.

During talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin , PM emphasized that solutions to the Ukraine conflict cannot be achieved on the battlefield and stressed the necessity of peace efforts.Pentagon, White House, and State Department spokespersons separately addressed India's ties with Russia and PM's Moscow visit. ""India and Russia have had a relationship for a very long time. From a US perspective, India is a strategic partner with whom we continue to engage in full and frank dialogue to include their relationship with Russia,"" said Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder at a news conference, as quoted by news agency PTI.Discussing the broader implications of PM's visit, Ryder said, ""I do not think anybody will be surprised if (Russian) President (Vladimir) Putin tries to represent this visit in a way that seeks to somehow show that he is not isolated from the rest of the world. And the fact of the matter is President Putin's war of choice has isolated Russia from the rest of the world, and it has come at great cost.

Bangladesh suspends job quotas after student protests,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-suspends-job-quotas-after-student-protests/articleshow/111634343.cms,"DHAKA: Bangladesh 's top court on Wednesday temporarily suspended quotas for coveted government jobs after thousands of students staged nationwide protests against what they call a discriminatory system, lawyers said.The quota system reserves more than half of well-paid and massively over-subscribed civil service posts, totalling hundreds of thousands of government jobs, for specific groups including children of liberation heroes.Students launched protests earlier this month, demanding a merit-based system , with demonstrations on Wednesday blocking highways and railway lines.""We will not return to classrooms until our demand is met,"" protest leader Rasel Ahmed of Chittagong University told AFP.The quota system was abolished in 2018 after weeks of protests, but reinstated in June by Dhaka's High Court, sparking fury from students.The Supreme Court on Wednesday suspended that order for a month, said lawyer Shah Monjurul Hoque, who represents two students seeking to end the quota system.Hoque told AFP that Chief Justice Obaidul Hassan had also requested that students return to class.Despite the call, student groups continued to block key highways and railway tracks, bringing traffic movement in much of the capital Dhaka and several major cities to a halt.""This (court) order is temporary. We want a permanent executive order from the government, saying that the quotas are abolished, except some quotas for the disabled and minorities,"" said Parvez Mosharraf, a student at Dhaka University.He was among dozens of students who laid timber logs on a railway track at Dhaka's Karwan Bazar, forcing the halt of train services connecting the capital to northern Bangladesh.- 'Limited number of jobs' -The quota system reserves 30 percent of government posts for children of those who fought to win Bangladeshi independence in 1971, 10 percent for women, and 10 percent for residents of specific districts.Students said only those quotas supporting ethnic minorities and disabled people -- six percent of jobs -- should remain.""We don't also want the job quotas for women because women are no longer lagging behind,"" female student Meena Rani Das, 22, told AFP.""Women are marching ahead with their talents. But the quota system is creating obstacles and snatching our rights.""Critics say the system benefits children of pro-government groups, who back Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.Her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, was Bangladesh's founding leader.Hasina, 76, won her fourth consecutive general election in January, in a vote without genuine opposition parties, with a widespread boycott and a major crackdown against her political opponents.Critics accuse Bangladeshi courts of rubber-stamping decisions made by her government.Hasina has condemned the protests, saying the matter had been settled by the court.""Students are wasting their time,"" Hasina said Sunday, adding there was ""no justification for the anti-quota movement"".Thousands of students on Wednesday threw up barricades across key intersections in Dhaka, as well as blocking major highways connecting the capital to other cities, police said.Hemayetul Islam, deputy police chief in the northwestern city of Rajshahi said that ""at least 200 students"" blocked the highway to Dhaka.""Brilliant students no longer get the jobs they want because of this quota system,"" said Halimatuz Sadia, a protester and physics student at Chittagong University.""You work hard only to find out that there are only a limited number of jobs available,"" she added.",Bangladesh's top court temporarily suspends quotas for coveted government jobs.

Edicts and some of the methods used to enforce them constituted a violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms, the report said.The Taliban set up a ministry for the ""propagation of virtue and the prevention of vice"" after seizing power in 2021.Since then, the ministry has enforced decrees issued by the Taliban leadership that have a disproportionate impact on women and girls, like dress codes, segregated education and employment, and having a male guardian when they travel.""The punishments attached to non-compliance with instructions and decrees are often arbitrary, severe and disproportionate,"" said the report from the UN Mission in Afghanistan. ""Sweeping bans with a discriminatory effect on women have been introduced. Human rights violations, as well as the unpredictability of enforcement measures, contribute to a climate of fear and intimidation among segments of the population.""The mission said it documented at least 1,033 instances between August 2021 and March 2024 where ministry employees applied force during the implementation of orders, resulting in the violation of a person's liberty, and physical and mental integrity.""This includes the use of threats, arbitrary arrests and detentions, excessive use of force by de facto law enforcement officials and ill-treatment."" These instances mostly affected men, who were punished for allegedly violating Taliban orders or because their female relatives had breached them, according to the report.It said the ministry's role was expanding into other areas of public life, including media monitoring and eradicating drug addiction.""Given the multiple issues outlined in the report, the position expressed by the de facto authorities that this oversight will be increasing and expanding gives cause for significant concern for all Afghans, especially women and girls,"" said Fiona Frazer, the head of UNAMA 's Human Rights Service.The ministry rejected the UN report, calling its findings false and contradictory.""Decrees and relevant legal documents are issued to reform society and should have their implementation ensured,"" the ministry said.The mission's report comes a week after a Taliban delegation travelled to Qatar to attend a UN-sponsored meeting on increasing engagement with Afghanistan amid the country's economic challenges and humanitarian crises.That meeting sparked anger from rights groups and activists because it excluded Afghan women and civil society.","The Taliban set up a ministry for the ""propagation of virtue and the prevention of vice"" after seizing power in 2021.
