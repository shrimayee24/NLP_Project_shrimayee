We're 'disturbed' by findings of CBI's RG Kar report: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/were-disturbed-by-findings-of-cbis-rg-kar-report-sc/articleshow/113439625.cms,"CBI line of probe indicates justice will be done: Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: In a setback to West Bengal government, Supreme Court on Tuesday said it was ""very disturbed"" by the status report of the CBI probe finding serious faults with the way Kolkata Police collected evidence and secured the crime scene in RG Kar Hospital where a doctor was raped and murdered on Aug 9.A bench led by CJI D Y Chandrachud made this observation after the counsel for the original petitioner before Calcutta HC accused state police of employing a bizarre process for search and seizure, and alleged that the crime scene was deliberately left unguarded to let vandals destroy vital evidence.""What you are flagging is of the utmost concern. CBI itself is very concerned that this has happened,"" CJI told the counsel.""CBI is investigating... whether there was tampering with the scene of crime, whether evidence was destroyed and whether any other person (apart from those arrested) was involved,"" SC said.It will be unwise for us to reveal anything at this stage, which may enable suspects to destroy evidence. Making a disclosure today of what the CBI is doing will jeopardise the course of investigation. We cannot also disclose the lines of further investigation of CBI,"" the SC bench, also comprising Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, said.The bench assured the parents of the victim and the resident doctors, who have been agitating for justice since the crime, that the line of investigation indicated that justice would be done, and the perpetrators of the crime would be brought to book.""We can assure you that the line of further investigation which is being carried out by CBI is intended to unearth the absolute truth and further truth and any further leads that may emerge apart from the accused who have been arrested. We will keep it at that so as not to jeopardise the investigations,"" the bench said, its comment appearing significant in view of Trinamool's frequent sniping at the premier investigating agency.Appearing for senior doctors of RG Kar and other hospitals in Kolkata, senior advocate Karuna Nundy said senior doctors had evidence in their possession that clearly established a link between the heinous crime and financial irregularities . The bench asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta to instruct CBI to file probe status report before the SC on the next date.""Apart from the principal, the SHO has been arrested. He is in the custody of CBI and very significant pieces of evidence may be revealed during the investigation. CBI has responded specifically to the queries which all of us raised during the last hearing, including whether the 'challan' and statutory form were submitted for post-mortem, what document was submitted by Kolkata Police for the purpose of post-mortem,"" the bench said.",CBI probe finds serious faults with the way Kolkata Police collected evidence and secured the crime scene in RG Kar Hospital where a doctor was raped and murdered on Aug 9.

Botched Naga op: SC closes criminal cases against 30 Armymen,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/botched-naga-op-sc-closes-criminal-cases-against-30-armymen/articleshow/113439693.cms,"Centre's

prosecution nod

denial again puts spotlight on

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday quashed criminal proceedings by Nagaland Police against the 30 Army personnel for allegedly killing 13 civilians in a 2021 botched operation to ambush militants in the state's Mon district. It said the Centre had declined sanction, which is mandatory before proceeding against Army personnel under Section 6 of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act.Noting that sanction had been declined since Feb last year, a bench of Justices Vikram Nath and P B Varale said the FIR lodged against the personnel could not survive and also refused to pass any direction for departmental proceedings against them.""The proceedings pursuant to the impugned FIRs shall remain closed. However, in case sanction is granted at any stage under Sec 6 of the AFSP Act-1958, the proceedings pursuant to the impugned FIRs may proceed in accordance with law and be brought to a logical conclusion,"" the bench said.The SC bench noted that the Nagaland govt had already approached the court challenging the Centre's decision to reject sanction to prosecute the Army personnel.The denial of sanction has again put the spotlight on Afspa which is resented by local communities who feel that it has been reduced to blanket immunity for the armed forces personnel guilty of atrocities and, worse, killings.The defence establishment and armed forces, however, have strongly argued for continuing with the controversial law, saying it is a necessary shield against harassment through malicious campaigns launched by overground supporters of insurgents.""The learned senior counsel and counsel for the parties had made submissions making allegations and counter-allegations. However, we are not inclined to go into those submissions, as in our opinion, in view of the specific bar contained in Section 6 of the Afspa, which provides that no prosecution, suit, or other legal proceedings can be instituted except with the previous sanction of the central govt with respect to exercise of any power conferred under the said Act, the proceedings based on the impugned FIRs cannot continue any further,"" the bench said.","Court quashes criminal proceedings by Nagaland Police against the 30 Army personnel for allegedly killing 13 civilians in a 2021 botched operation to ambush militants in the state's Mon district.

SC halts bulldozer action without its nod till October 1,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-halts-bulldozer-action-without-its-nod-till-october-1/articleshow/113439715.cms,"May seek EC view on netas extolling

bulldozer action

: Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday put the brakes on 'bulldozer justice' by directing all state governments and their authorities not to carry out any demolition work till Oct 1 without taking its approval. It added that people holding public office must stop glorifying the practice or engage in grandstanding on it.Raising serious concern over bulldozers being used as a punitive tool, which SC said was against the ethos of the Constitution and needed to be subjected to ""judicial oversight"", Justices B R Gavai and K V Viswanathan said there was apprehension of its misuse by the executive, which could not act as the judge.However, the bench said that its order would not come in the way of authorities taking action in case of encroachment on roads and public land, and structures built on it could be demolished without notice even if they were religious in nature.SC passed the interim order that would remain valid till the next date of hearing on Oct 1 after it was alleged that razing of houses and commercial property continued unabated in different states even after SC frowned on the practice and agreed to examine a plea for framing guidelines.Senior advocate C U Singh and lawyer Fauzia Shakil brought to the court's notice incidents in Rajasthan's Bhilwara where several shops were recently razed. Senior advocate M R Shamshad, appearing for Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind, pitched in and said targeted demolitions were being carried out.The contention was countered by SG Tushar Mehta who told the court that a narrative was being built that people from a particular community were being targeted by bulldozers, and urged the court not to give credence to it.Mehta said notices were served in 2022 in the case of the demolitions in Rajasthan, adding that in MP, 50% of the 700-odd shops demolished belonged to Hindus.The bench asked the SG why demolitions were ""hurriedly"" carried out in Rajasthan when nothing had been done in the last two years and assured him that it did not get affected or influenced by ""outside noise"". SC said it was not concerned about any community but about law and its implementation, which should be applicable to all. ""Our immediate priority is to streamline the procedure,"" SC said.The court also took strong exception to people holding public office, including ministers, extolling the practice of bulldozer justice and said it may seek response from Election Commission on the issue. ""This glorification, grandstanding and justification of bulldozer has to stop,"" the bench said.The court thereafter passed the interim order and said, ""Till next date, there shall be no demolitions without seeking leave of this court. However, such an order would not be applicable for unauthorised constructions on public streets, footpaths, abutting railway lines or public spaces.""On the previous hearing on Sept 2, the bench had strongly criticised the practice of 'bulldozer justice' by demolishing homes or commercial places just because it belonged to someone who was alleged to have committed an offence and emphasised the need for nationwide guidelines and had sought suggestions from parties.Another SC bench on Sept 12 had said govt authorities indulging in 'bulldozer justice' amounted to running a bulldozer over the laws of the land and had added that alleged involvement in crime was no ground for demolition of a property.""In a country where actions of the state are governed by the rule of law, transgression by a family member cannot invite action against other members of the family or their legally constructed residence. Alleged involvement in crime is no ground for demolition of a property. Moreover, the alleged crime has to be proved through due legal process in a court of law. The court cannot be oblivious to such demolition threats inconceivable in a nation where law is supreme. Otherwise, such actions may be seen as running a bulldozer over the laws of the land,"" a bench of Justices Hrishikesh Roy, Sudhanshu Dhulia and SVN Bhatti had said.","Supreme Court directs all state governments and their authorities not to carry out any demolition work till Oct 1 without taking its approval. Justices B R Gavai and K V Viswanathan said there was apprehension of its misuse by the executive, which could not act as judge.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113439727,imgsize-982221,width-400,resizemode-4/113439727.jpg"

CHHATRAPATI SAMBHAJINAGAR/PUNE: Maratha quota activist Manoj Jarange said this was state govt's last chance to accept all demands of the community and deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis would be held responsible otherwise, before starting another indefinite hunger strike from Monday midnight.Jarange's fresh strike is scheduled to align with Marathwada Mukti Sangram Day on Tuesday.Speaking to the media in the Antarwali Sarati village on Monday, Jarange said, ""This strike is the Maratha community 's way of giving govt another chance. We have no intention of playing politics. If govt does not want us to engage in politics, it should fulfil our demands.""He said, ""I have decided to go on hunger strike all of a sudden. My community has been fighting for reservation for the past one year. This time, it'll be a conclusive hunger strike.""Referring to his previous strike, Jarange pointed out that state govt was responsive, but the situation has changed. ""We will continue our efforts. No movement depends on someone showing up. If govt does not provide quota for the Maratha community, Fadnavis will be held accountable,"" he said.Jarange had recently announced he would take a decision on fielding candidates of his community in the upcoming assembly elections or ensure defeat of MLAs not supporting his demand.He clarified his stance on Monday and said, ""From today, I will not speak on political matters. Our movement is not connected to any election, and I will not utter a word on politics. State govt should implement Maratha reservation and not try to escape responsibility later."" He added that if govt fails to fulfill the demand, there will be no point blaming Marathas later for Mahayuti's debacle in polls and gains made by the opposition.""We do not want to enter politics. That is not our goal. If govt accepts all our demands, we will immediately withdraw agitations. Its inaction is forcing us to contemplate other options,"" Jarange said.The assembly polls are expected to be held immediately after Diwali. Jarange has warned govt to take a decision on his demands before the code of conduct comes into place.""If the code of conduct comes into place, no decision can be taken. Hence, I am demanding that govt take a call immediately. We want all Maratha community members to be treated as Kunbi and implementation of the sage soyare clause right away, along with other demands,"" said the activist.Meanwhile, commenting on the latest state govt resolution (GR) to club the Dhangad and Dhangar communities, Jarange commended the move and said, ""This is a positive step.

In Mandi, hundreds gathered on Jail Road, protesting against a mosque that partially stands on Public Works Department (PWD) land.The police used water cannons and tear gas to disperse the protesters and imposed prohibitory orders to prevent gatherings of five or more people.Protestors, chanting Hanuman Chalisa, attempted to breach barricades near the mosque.The protests in Mandi followed similar unrest in Shimla’s Sanjauli area, where violent demonstrations erupted over another mosque’s illegal construction. In both cases, Hindu organisations have been calling for the demolition of unauthorised structures.The situation in Mandi escalated after the local court ordered the demolition of the illegal portion of the mosque within 30 days, a decision announced just hours before the protests.According to authorities, members of the mosque committee had already started demolishing the disputed structure, located on PWD land. Iqbal Ali, a representative of the mosque committee, stated that the community had voluntarily removed the illegal section. However, despite these efforts, protests still broke out, with more than 700 police personnel deployed to maintain law and order.As tensions persist, authorities are working to calm the situation, with both the Mandi and Sanjauli mosque controversies now under the spotlight. Political figures like BJP spokesperson Chetan Bragta have criticized the government’s response, while the local Muslim community has expressed a willingness to follow legal procedures. Several FIRs have been lodged in relation to the protests, and police injuries were reported during earlier confrontations in Shimla.","Hindu groups demand action against alleged illegal construction in Shimla.

Hundreds of people, mostly women, have taken to the streets in support of Gisele Pelicot , with feminist groups organising 30 gatherings across cities from Marseille to Paris, displaying banners like “Support to Gisele” and “Victims, We Believe You.”Appearing in court with a cane due to health issues, Pelicot confessed, saying, ""I admit to the charges in their entirety...I am a rapist just like all the others in this room,"" according to BFM TV. The case, involving his 72-year-old wife Gisele, unfolded after Pelicot drugged her with sleeping pills and tranquilizers without her knowledge. Over the years, he invited more than 50 men he met online to sexually assault her at their home in Mazan, near Avignon. Despite the horrific details, Gisele has shown immense courage throughout the trial. She allowed journalists to use her full name and gave permission for explicit videos of the abuse to be shown in court. Her bravery has made her a symbol of the fight against sexual violence in France.The abuse, which began in 2011, continued until it was discovered in 2020 when Pelicot was caught secretly filming women in a supermarket. Upon further investigation, authorities uncovered 20,000 photographs documenting the assaults on Gisele, which Pelicot meticulously organised.Pelicot's actions caused his wife to believe she was suffering from Alzheimer’s disease, as the drugging impaired her memory. He reportedly imposed strict rules on the men to avoid waking her, including maintaining personal hygiene and undressing in the kitchen.The trial involves not only Pelicot but also the 50 men who participated in the assaults. The proceedings are expected to last four months. While some of the defendants claimed they were misled by Pelicot into believing Gisele was consenting, others argued that a husband’s consent was sufficient, sparking outrage across the country. One lawyer controversially stated that “there is rape and rape, and without intention, there is no rape.”Shocking revelations during the trial also deeply affected Pelicot’s family, including his daughter Caroline Darain, who left the courtroom after discovering nude photos of herself on her father’s computer.","Dominique Pelicot, 71, has admitted to drugging his wife and facilitating her rape by dozens of men over nearly a decade.

According to Bower, Harry expected his family to see similarities between his late mother, Diana, and Meghan, but was left disappointed. “No one agreed that his vulnerable mother had anything in common with his girlfriend. More discomforting for him, they thought Meghan would not fit in with the Royal Family ,” Bower wrote. As Mirror.co.uk reports, this sentiment was voiced by Charles Spencer, Diana's brother, who, at the request of Prince William, weighed in on the matter.Spencer, who had been married three times, reportedly urged his nephew to reconsider rushing into marriage. His words, however, provoked a strong reaction from Harry, who later reflected on how difficult it was to establish Meghan’s place in the family.Earl Spencer wasn’t the only person to express doubts about Harry and Meghan’s relationship. According to Bower, Meghan's former talent agent, Gina Nelthorpe-Cowne, also cautioned the former actress that Royal life would mean giving up her career.

However, tensions within the Royal Family have been well-documented, and the couple stepped back from their Royal duties in 2020.","Earl Spencer was reportedly asked to counsel his nephew on the difficulties Meghan might face in adjusting to royal life.

Gisele Pelicot case explained

What is going on in court?

Hundreds of people, mostly women, came out in the street in support of Gisele Pelicot, a woman who was allegedly drugged by her ex-husband (who was her husband at that time) for a decade and he recruited dozens of strangers to rape her which has shocked the nation.The feminist associations have called for some 30 gatherings on Saturday in cities ranging from Marseille to Paris, where on the Place de la Republique banners read “Support to Gisele” or “Shame Must Change Camp” or “Victims We believe you”.Pelicot has become France ’s symbol of the fight against sexual violence , AP New reported.A 72-year-old woman caught the attention of headlines when she filed a case against her ex-husband Dominique Pelicot of repeatedly raping her and enlisting strangers to abuse his heavily sedated wife in the couple’s home over the course of a decade.Since the beginning of the case Pelicot has to go through a rough path. She chose to go for a public trial to alert the public to sexual abuse and drug-induced blackouts.During this trial, she had to face 51 of her alleged rapists which is due to run until December. People are praised for her courage and composure.She also allowed journalists to use her full name in their articles or the other platforms and even gave a nod to the court to exhibit explicit videos recorded by her husband showing men engaging in sexual intercourse with her naked, inert body.Her bold and courageous behaviour is praised by the entire France nation and even foreign countries.In an open letter translated into English and published in the French newspaper Le Monde, journalist and author Helene Devynck thanked Pelicot for her bravery, echoing the feelings of many other French people.“You entered our lives like you entered the Avignon court, through the front door,” wrote Devynck, a figure of the French #MeToo movement. “It’s not just you, Gisele, that they’ve treated like a thing. They were telling us, all of us women, how insignificant we are. Your strength restores ours. Thank you for this immense gift.”According to the police, the abuse began in 2011 when the couple lived near Paris and continued after their move to Mazan. Dominique routinely drugged his wife and invited strangers to join him in assaulting her, often filming the encounters. Pelicot has no memory of the attacks but will see many of them played in court as dozens of defendants go on trial in Avignon, France, between now and December. The revelation of his abuse has destroyed a formerly tight-knit family, and the reason behind his actions remains unclear.Pelicot came to know about this horrifying act through the police who gave her the information.Dominique’s crimes came to light in 2020 when he was caught filming women up their skirts in a supermarket. Upon investigation, authorities uncovered the scale of the abuse. He and 50 other men are now on trial for aggravated rape, with the proceedings expected to last four months. The victims of these attacks included various individuals, from a fire brigade officer to a journalist, and while most participated only once, some returned multiple times.Pelicot will face the man with whom she shared her life for over 50 years and the father of their three children on Monday. Her lawyer has said she is planning on attending his testimony.Her ex-husband, Dominique Pelicot, for health reasons, has been exempted from attending the trial since last week. He is expected to testify on Monday or Tuesday, his lawyer, Béatrice Zavarro, has said.Dominique has previously confessed to the crimes to investigators, but his court hearing will be crucial for the panel of judges to decide on the fate of the 50 other men accused of rape, reported AP news agency.Some defendants have claimed they believed a husband's consent for sexual intercourse was sufficient, while others said they were tricked by Dominique Pelicot into believing his wife was consenting.One lawyer representing six defendants has shocked the nation by arguing that ""there is rape and rape, and without intention, there is no rape.""","Gisele Pelicot, 72, has been accused of repeatedly raping her ex-husband Dominique.

The man did not fire at Trump, who was about 500 yards away golfing with a friend.Soon after the incident, Trump assured his followers that he was safe and well. “There were gunshots in my vicinity, but before rumors start spiraling out of control, I wanted you to hear this first: I AM SAFE AND WELL! Nothing will slow me down. I will NEVER SURRENDER!” he posted on his platform ""Truth Social.""He later thanked the Secret Service and law enforcement for keeping him safe on what he called “an interesting day."" One lawmaker who spoke to Trump after the incident said he had joked about not being able to complete his round of gold.In an oblique reference to an earlier assassination attempt on him in Pennsylvania, Trump later wrote, ""When you’re “hot” the lowlifes really shoot at you... and they try hitting from every angle! Never let the bastards get you down.""In separate statements, President Joe Biden and vice-president Kamala Harris expressed relief that Trump was unharmed and said the was no place for political violence in the country, as activists on both sides accused the other of engendering the atmosphere conducive to such violence.Social media posts matching Routh's name showed him strongly supporting Ukraine in its war with Russia, and urging the US Congress to allow Americans to fight in the conflict.He had also been in the public eye a few times after encounters with the media and law enforcement. In an NYT interview in 2023, he said he was trying to recruit Afghan solders who fled the Taliban to fight in Ukraine. He had also been arrested in 2002 in Greensboro, North Carolina, after barricading himself inside a building with an automatic weapon.Tracked down by a tabloid, his estranged son Oran Routh told the Daily Mail that his father was a ""great dad"" and a ""nice guy"" and he hates Trump -- like “all reasonable people.”Although Trump praised the Secret Service and law enforcement for acting quickly to protect him, questions raged about how a potential assassin managed to get so close to the former president again.“There continues to be a lack of answers for the horrific assassination attempt in Pennsylvania and we expect there to be a clear explanation of what happened in Florida,” Republican lawmaker Elise Stefanik said in a statement.""Two assassination attempts in 60 days on a former President & the Republican nominee is unacceptable. The Secret Service must come to Congress tomorrow, tell us what resources are needed to expand the protective perimeter, & lets allocate it in a bipartisan vote the same day,"" California Democrat Ro Khanna tweeted.The Trump campaign responded by promoting the Republican candidate's message of unity and peace, while simultaneously directing supporters to a fundraising page.On the other hand, Democrats focused on gun control issues, questioning how a potential assassin with a criminal record was able to acquire an AK-47.","Man with a gun was lying in ambush at a Florida resort where the MAGA supremo was golfing.

The US was not aware of this incident in advance. At this point, we're gathering information,"" Miller said.Miller's comments followed confirmation from Lebanon’s Health Minister, Firass Abiad, who reported that the explosions, which occurred across the country, have resulted in at least eight fatalities and injuries to approximately 2,750 individuals. Abiad also mentioned that about 200 people are in critical condition, with victims receiving treatment in over 150 hospitals.When asked about the details of the information the US has collected, Miller explained that the US is gathering facts similarly to journalists but did not provide a public update. He also refrained from speculating on the involvement of any parties, including Israel. Miller stressed that the US aims to see a diplomatic resolution to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah and preferred not to comment on the potential implications of the incident at this stage.In response to questions about Iran's possible role, Miller declined to speculate, urging that any information should be confirmed before drawing conclusions. He reiterated that the US would advise Iran against exploiting the incident to heighten regional tensions.""I never want to comment or speculate about the impact of any one incident, especially in the early stages of the incident. I am not going to do so here, that has been our policy to try to avoid doing. Our overall policy remains consistent, which is we do want to see a diplomatic resolution to the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. We want to see one that allows the tens of thousands of Israelis who have been displaced from their homes and tens of thousands of Lebanese who have been displaced from their homes to return home. That's what we are continuing to pursue,"" he said.Hezbollah has reported that the explosions, which they attribute to malfunctioning pagers used by their personnel, resulted in the deaths of two fighters and a civilian. The group described the incident as their ""biggest security breach"" in nearly a year. Meanwhile, unverified reports from Arab media suggest that the explosions may be linked to an Israeli cyber attack, although no official statement has been issued by the Israeli military.Israel’s Security Cabinet has updated its war objectives, now including the safe return of northern residents displaced by Hezbollah attacks as a key goal.

The 51-44 vote fell short of the 60 votes required, with only two Republican senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, voting in favour of the bill.Vice President Kamala Harris condemned the Republicans' actions, saying they made it clear once again that they would not protect access to the fertility treatments many couples need to fulfil their dream of having a child. President Biden echoed these concerns, calling the refusal to safeguard access to fertility treatments ""outrageous and unacceptable.""Democrats, led by Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth, criticised Republicans for what they described as hypocrisy, arguing that while many GOP members claim to support IVF, they refuse to back legislation that guarantees its availability. ""They say they support IVF—here you go, vote on this,"" Duckworth said, drawing on her own experience with fertility treatments.The push for this legislation gained momentum following a controversial ruling by the Alabama Supreme Court, which classified frozen embryos as children. In response, several IVF clinics in Alabama suspended their services until the state legislature intervened. Democrats sought to highlight the risks to reproductive rights, particularly after the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022.Republicans defended their position, arguing that the federal government should not dictate state policies and dismissed the bill as a political stunt. South Dakota Senator John Thune insisted that Republicans do support IVF, yet raised concerns about federal overreach.Last month, Donald Trump told NBC News that under his administration, IVF treatments would be covered by insurance companies. “We’re going to be mandating that the insurance company pay,” he said.

Insiders, as quoted by Daily Mail, said either Kimberly did not know about Bettina or didn't want to know.""She's no fool but it's easy to deceive yourself when you are so committed to someone and believe he's committed to you,"" an insider was quoted.37-year-old Bettina Anderson is a Florida socialite -- the daughter of Inger and the late Harry Loy Anderson Jr. Her closeness with Don Jr is an open secret in Florida town and they are often spotted together -- comfortable and cosy. Photos of them kissing several times during the meal at The Honor Bar triggered speculations that they do not want their relationship to be secret anymore.People believe Donald Trump Jr is wayward and not accountable for what he does to anyone -- at least not to Kimberley, but probably his father.Bettina is a model, a bachelor of arts in art history, criticism and conservation from Columbia University.55-year-old Kimberly Guilfoyle is nine years older than Donald Trump Jr. A former prosecutor, Guilfoyle was married twice -- once to Gavin Newsom, the present California Democratic governor.

Donald Trump: Polls show Kamala Harris edging ahead of Trump with 61 percent chances of winning,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/polls-show-kamala-harris-edging-ahead-of-trump-with-61-percent-chances-of-winning/articleshow/113435087.cms,"WASHINGTON: Kamala Harris has widened her lead over Donald Trump in all but one of dozen different polls tracked by the polling aggregator 538 after their presidential debate . Her lead in nationwide popular vote now ranges between 2 points to 7 points, with most of them beyond the typical 3.5 point margin of error. Only one poll by AtlasIntel puts Trump ahead by four.While Trump could lose the national popular vote and still clinch the Presidency by winning the electoral college determined by votes in individual states, the bad news for the Trump campaign is 538 now gives him only a 39 percent chance of winning the electoral college, while boosting Harris's odds to 61 per cent.In 1000 simulations run by the aggregator, Harris won 609 times while Trump won 387 times, with no winner four times.The polls were conducted before the second purported assassination attempt on Trump, which some of the MAGA media is lamenting is not being taken seriously by the mainstream media. 538 is owned by ABC News, which Trump accuses of being in cahoots with the Kamala Harris and tilting last week's debate to favor her.However, Nate Silver , who originally founded 538 before it was bought by ABC News, gives Trump the opposite numbers. His model, on blog Silver Bulletin, had the reverse odds for the election, putting Trump at 60 percent and Harris at 38 percent.Such simulated numbers are dodgy considering Hillary Clinton was given more than 90 percent chances of winning on the eve of the 2016 election.Both sides are accusing each other of manipulating polls to claim victory in the event of a close election, with many analysts concerned about the possibility of gridlock and violence on November 5. Typically election results become apparent by late night on election day, particularly if one side wins convincingly. But close race where getting to 270 electoral college votes needed to win boils down to one or two states is expected to cause tensions because some states -- notably Pennsylvania -- could take a long time to count mail-in ballots.Every state, and sometimes even counties, have different election rules and laws. Pennsylvania does not begin to sort out mail-in ballots till the morning of the election, while some states allow sorting (not opening) before election day to expedite counting. A large percentage of Pennsylvania's ballots come from in and around Democrat-leaning Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, and they take a long time to count, usually giving Republicans early leads in the state before Democrats close the gap. Some analysts suggest a candidate could potentially declare a win on the basis of early leads to muddy the waters and not allow the process of counting and certification.Already, there are surveys showing nearly half of Republicans saying they won’t accept the results of the presidential election if their candidate loses, and some of them say they would “take action to overturn” the results. About a quarter of Democrats said they wouldn’t accept the results if their candidate loses, but fewer Democrats than Republicans said they would “take action to overturn” the results.A poll by the nonpartisan World Justice Project did not ask people what specific “action” they would take to overturn the election results, only that that 46% of Republicans and 27% of Democrats wouldn't accept results, and 14% of Republicans compared to 11% of Democrats said they would ""take action.""","Kamala Harris has widened her lead over Donald Trump in all but one of dozen different polls tracked by the polling aggregator 538.

In response, district police initiated an investigation, analyzing CCTV footage from various surveillance cameras to identify the militants responsible for the attack.The militants used PUBG's chat room as a means of communication to evade electronic surveillance, making it difficult for authorities to monitor their activities.Zahidullah, the district police officer of Swat, revealed that while investigators initially focused on a motorcycle seen in CCTV footage near the police station prior to the explosion, their efforts to identify the nature of the attack were complicated. He said police found one person using a mobile phone and they believed that it would help them to hunt down the militants. However, militants never called each other but utilised features of PUBG to avoid being traced, he added.“The militants would play PUBG to practice and motivate their group members for battle against the state and would use the chat room for communication,” Dawn quoted Zahidullah as saying.The investigation ultimately revealed that the attackers had employed an improvised explosive device (IED) constructed from a power bank, rather than a hand grenade, as initially suspected.CCTV footage led to the identification of one suspect, which subsequently resulted in the arrest of additional suspects who disclosed their affiliation with a local militant group, Murad alias Rehmatullah, associated with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan .The arrested suspects admitted to maintaining communication with their group and family members in Afghanistan through PUBG chat rooms, frequently changing mobile phones and SIM cards to avoid detection.","Militants targeted a police station in Swat, Pakistan, on August 28, killing one officer.

If what the police claim is true, then the situation is extremely scary,"" Khan added.Further taking a jibe in his post, the former Prime Minister also criticised the country's institutions using cricketing terminology.""Whenever Sikandar Sultan Raja (Chief Election Commissioner) bowls, Qazi Faez Isa (Chief Justice of Pakistan) is in the first slip, while Aamer Farooq (Chief Justice of Islamabad High Court) in second slip [cricket analogy].This is a fixed match, the outcome of which has already been decided based on the London Plan, and where all the characters are dishonest,"" Khan stated.","Imran Khan compared the current situation with the era of military ruler Yahya Khan.

"Imran Khan blames military for CM disappearance, says Pakistan scene is ‘Yahya Khan Part II’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imran-khan-blames-military-for-cm-disappearance-says-pakistan-scene-is-yahya-khan-part-ii/articleshow/113334502.cms,"ReplyReply allForward



ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) chief Imran Khan blamed the establishment, a euphemism for the military in Pakistan, for the disappearance of his party’s chief minister of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Ali Amin Gandapur , from Islamabad.Speaking to journalists at Rawalpindi prison on Friday, Khan claimed that Gandapur “was disappeared” by elements within the establishment and everyone knows who is responsible for such actions, an indirect reference to Pakistan’s intelligence agencies.He accused the military establishment of undermining the country’s institutions.According to Khan, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa CM has remained silent over his disappearance out of loyalty and respect for the establishment. Khan warned the current situation in the country is reminiscent of “Yahya Khan Part II”.Imran also spoke on the current state of governance, claiming that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif required approval (from the military) for every decision and could soon face a similar fate — disappearance.Gandapur went missing from Islamabad during a crackdown on PTI last Monday, a day after he had delivered a hard-hitting speech at a rally demanding the release of Imran Khan. He later turned up in Peshawar. Gandapur, according to PTI, was invited by the military authorities to discuss law and order matters, but he was allegedly detained without consent. His statement that he would personally secure Khan’s release in the next two weeks triggered a sharp backlash in a country where the powerful military has directly ruled the country for three decades and wielded enormous political influence even when civilian governments were in office.","Imran Khan blames the establishment for the disappearance of his party’s chief minister of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Ali Amin Gandapur.
