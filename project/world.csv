He was part of a four-member group that had travelled to Jordan on three-month tourist visas, misled by an agency promising Israeli work visas.Pereira's family in Thiruvananthapuram district found out his death after Edison, a 43-year-old relative who was also part of the group, was recently deported by Jordan following medical treatment for a leg wound suffered in the shooting. The other two members remain in a Jordanian prison.According to reports, Indian embassy in Jordan informed Pereira's family about his death through an email, but the message went unchecked for long. His family has now approached Norka Roots , a Kerala govt agency for expatriates, seeking help in repatriating his body.Pereira and Edison, both autorickshaw drivers, had not disclosed their true intentions before their departure. Their families were informed only hours before their journey to Jordan on Feb 5. The two remained in contact until Feb 9, after which they attempted to cross into Israel through a mountainous valley on Feb 10. Jordanian soldiers spotted and opened fire on them.Their relative Agnes Henry expressed the family's distress. ""We have no clue who took them to Jordan and how much money was paid. Please help get at least his body back,"" she said.The case has raised concerns over illegal migration and fraudulent visa agencies.""Many have fallen victim to visa agency fraud . Recently, many from coastal villages were misled into joining the Russian army under false job promises, and fight the war in Ukraine. Police must take action to raise awareness and prevent such scams,"" Norka Roots CEO Ajith Kolassery said.","Jordanian border guards shot dead 47-year-old autorickshaw driver Thomas Gabriel Pereira.

"'People have developed habit of begging from government,' says MP mantri, triggers row",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/people-have-developed-habit-of-begging-from-government-says-mp-mantri-triggers-row/articleshow/118668326.cms,"Patel said, ‘Gathering army of beggars doesn’t strengthen society, it weakens it’

BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh minister Prahlad Patel has sparked a controversy by equating public demands and petitions to govt with ""begging"". At a function in Rajgarh district on Saturday, panchayat and rural development minister Patel said this ""army of beggars"" is weakening society.""People have developed a habit of begging from govt. Politicians come, they get a basketful of papers. They are garlanded on stage and a letter is put in their hands. This is not a good habit. Instead of taking, develop the mindset of giving. You will be happy and will build a cultured society. Gathering an army of beggars does not strengthen society, but weakens it. The attraction towards free things is not a mark of respect for these brave women,"" Patel, a former Union minister, said after unveiling a statue of Rani Avantibai Lodhi at Suthaliya town.""Can you name any martyr who has ever begged? Despite this, we continue to organise programmes, make speeches, and move on,"" Patel said, adding that as a ""Narmada Parikrama pilgrim"", he has asked for alms, but never for himself. Videos of his speech were shared on social media, triggering sharp criticism from opposition Congress.PCC president Jitu Patwari posted on X: ""Residents of the state, arrogant BJP is now calling the public beggars! This is an insult to the hopes and tears of those in sorrow! They make false promises during elections and then backtrack. When people remind them of their promises, they call them beggars. Remember them well, many such faces of BJP will come to your doorstep again in some time, begging for votes.""In another post he wrote, ""... If BJP calls a demand for rights begging, then the public must consider how those who beg for votes dare to openly call them beggars. If those who beg for votes and remain in power as traders of authority can call the public beggars, it would be a historic insult to public opinion! If those who pretend to be the 'chief servant' remain silent this time, then the public will have to prepare their own bitter pill for their pain.""Leader of opposition Umang Singhar said, ""It is duty of government and its ministers to serve the public. Patel is a senior minister. He & govt must clarify whether people of state are being referred to as beggars.""","Madhya Pradesh minister Prahlad Patel has sparked a controversy by equating public demands and petitions to govt with ""begging"" At a function in Rajgarh district on Saturday, panchayat and rural development minister Patel said this ""army of beggars"" is weakening society.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118668334,imgsize-1013802,width-400,resizemode-4/118668334.jpg"

The USA National Anthem was booed by the Canadian fans

It was an unpleasant night for the citizens of the United States to see their national anthem receive loud jeers at the WWE Elimination Chamber.The WWE Elimination Chamber 2025 Premium Live Event was a night of absolute shockers and game-changing events. The WWE Universe witnessed things that were unimaginable until some time back. However, it was certainly an uncomfortable moment for the United States audience watching worldwide as the Canadian fans in attendance showed no remorse to them.The opening of the WWE Elimination Chamber 2025 event, taking place in the Rogers Centre in Toronto, Canada, saw Elizabeth Irving by singing the USA National Anthem “The Star-Spangled Banner.” This was met with clouds jeers and boos as Irving sung the entire anthem. However, when Elizabeth decided to sing the Canadian National Anthem, ""O Canada"", it was met with a highly positive reception.Later in the show, WWE commentator Pat McAfee is at the commentary desk. McAfee slammed the audience by claiming that it was unfortunate that the WWE Elimination Chamber PLE was taking place in Canada. McAfee's exact words were, “the terrible country of Canada that booed our National Anthem.”This comes as a really unfortunate situation as it was a clear sign of division among WWE fans between USA and Canada. It has been this way at many major sporting events too ever since USA President Donald Trump imposed high tarriffs of 25% on the imports of several Canadian goods. This has seemingly severed some ties between both countries and is becoming evident at such big events. Moreover, this also received a lot of mixed responses on social media.Regardless the show went on as planned witnessing some of the most shocking moments in the history of WWE and has made the road to WrestleMania 41 highly unpredictable and must-see to watch.Also read: WWE Elimination Chamber 2025 Shocking Moments: John Cena Turns Heel for the First Time in 25 Years, Teams up with The Rock to Challenge Cody Rhodes",The USA National Anthem was booed by the Canadian fans at the WWE Elimination Chamber 2025.

ACLU sues to block migrant transfers by US to Gitmo,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/aclu-sues-to-block-migrant-transfers-by-us-to-gitmo/articleshow/118670295.cms,"New camp where the Trump administration plans to house migrants at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay (NYT photo)

WASHINGTON: The Trump administration faced the first direct legal challenge to its policy of sending migrants to the US military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for continued immigration detention with a lawsuit filed Saturday by a coalition of human rights and immigrant advocacy organisations .""Plaintiffs seek this court's intervention to put a stop to these cruel, unnecessary and illegal transfers to and detention at Guantanamo,"" the newly filed complaint said. The plaintiffs, led by the American Civil Liberties Union, are for now seeking a judicial stay to block the transfer of 10 migrants whom the coalition signed up to represent. But it appears to lay the groundwork to seek a potential broader order against the transfer policy, which has raised many novel legal issues.The 10 migrants named in the lawsuit have final removal orders, it said, and come from countries including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Venezuela. The lawsuit asserts that none are gang members, and some have been specifically threatened with transfer to Guantanamo. ""In attempting to justify the transfers, the govt has claimed that the individuals it sent to Guantanamo are members of gangs and dangerous criminals - the 'worst of the worst,'"" the complaint said, citing a remark in Jan by defense secretary Pete Hegseth. It continued: ""That characterisation is patently false. It is also legally irrelevant because the govt lacks statutory authority to send any immigration detainees from the US to Guantanamo."" The justice department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","The lawsuit was filed by a coalition of human rights and immigrant advocacy organisations. The plaintiffs, led by the American Civil Liberties Union, are for now seeking a judicial stay to block the transfer of 10 migrants.

MOSCOW: Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov Sunday praised President Trump's ""common sense"" aim to end the war in Ukraine, but accused European powers which have rallied around Kyiv of seeking to prolong the conflict. Lavrov said the US still wanted to be the world's most powerful country and that Washington and Moscow would never see eye to eye on everything, but they had agreed to be pragmatic when interests coincided.Lavrov said the model of US-China relationship was the one that should be built between Russia and the US to do a lot of ""mutually beneficial things"" without allowing disagreements to collapse into war.

It means, as everyone can see, a shift to a different way of doing things.""""But the goal is still MAGA ,"" Lavrov said. ""This gives a lively, human character to politics. That's why it's interesting to work with him.""Lavrov criticised Europe, saying for the past 500 years it had been the crucible of ""all the tragedies of the world"" including colonisation, wars, crusaders, Crimean War, Napoleon Bonaparte, WWI and Hitler.

Some held placards saying ‘Putin Kaput’ or calling for a ban on all international trade with Russia.

LONDON: British PM Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Europe was at a crossroads in history and must do the heavy lifting to defend itself as world leaders met in London to discuss ways of working together to stop Russia's war in Ukraine. His call for European allies to increase their arms spending to shore up their own defences and Ukraine's was not a sign that he thought the US had become an unreliable ally, he said. No two countries are closely aligned than the UK and the US, Starmer said. ""One thing our history tells us is that if there is conflict in Europe, it will wash up on our shores,"" he said.The summit comes two days after US support for Ukraine appeared in greater jeopardy after President Trump lashed out at Ukrainian President Zelensky and said he wasn't grateful enough for US support. Starmer hosted more than 19 world leaders, mostly from across Europe, and also Canadian PM Justin Trudeau. ""Even while Russia talks about peace, they are continuing their relentless aggression,"" Starmer said at the opening of the meeting. Starmer, flanked by Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron, said the three of them had agreed to work on a plan to stop the fighting, and take that to the US, which has discussed brokering a peace deal. ""We need to agree what steps come out of this meeting to deliver peace through strength for the benefit of all,"" he said. ""So, let's get started.""European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen warned on Sunday that ""we urgently have to rearm Europe"". Before the meeting, Von der Leyen said she would present a ""comprehensive plan"" at the EU summit, adding that ""we have to have a surge in defence"" and ""step up massively"". ""It's now of utmost importance we increase spending ... it's important we prepare for the worst,"" she added. Addressing Trump, she said: ""We're ready together with you to defend democracy, to defend the principle that there's a rule of law, that you cannot invade your neighbour and bully your neighbour, or you cannot change borders with force. It's in our common interest that we prevent future wars.""Italian PM Meloni met with Zelensky on the sidelines of the London meeting on Sunday, reaffirming Italy's support for Ukraine. Her office said she expressed support, together with European and Western partners and the US, ""to build a just and lasting peace, which ensures a future of sovereignty, security and freedom for Ukraine"". It was in line with Italy's position through the war while keeping the US in the picture.The leaders of the three Baltic states have not publicly criticised the decision not to include them in London's meeting.

TEHRAN: Iran's parliament on Sunday impeached the country's finance minister and voted to remove him from office amid growing concerns over the crashing rial and accusations of mismanagement.Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf announced that 182 out of 273 lawmakers voted to dismiss Abdolnasser Hemmati , just six months after President Masoud Pezeshkian 's government took office.Pezeshkian, who defended Hemmati, emphasized that the government is locked in a tough battle with the West. He called for greater unity and cooperation from Parliament to face these challenges.The decision comes amid rising tensions over Iran's nuclear program and worsening relations with the West. Iran's economy has been severely affected by international sanctions, especially after the U.S. withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal. In 2015, the rial was worth 32,000 to the dollar, but by the time Pezeshkian took office in July, it had plummeted to 584,000 to the dollar. Recently, it dropped even further, with exchange shops in Tehran trading 930,000 rials for each dollar.During the impeachment proceedings, Mohammad Qasim Osmani, a lawmaker supporting Hemmati, argued that rising inflation and exchange rates were not the fault of the current government or Parliament. He pointed to the budget deficit left by the previous administration, which he said contributed to the economic instability. Osmani also cited recent geopolitical events as factors that undermined public confidence, causing many people to convert their savings into foreign currency, which in turn further devalued the rial.Hemmati acknowledged the tough economic climate during his five months in office, including a 10% reduction in inflation. However, he acknowledged that inflation remained high, standing at 35%. He assured lawmakers that his team was working hard to address the issue, but warned that the process would take time.This latest development is another chapter in Iran's ongoing political and economic struggles as the country continues to navigate a complex relationship with the international community.","Iran's parliament impeached the country's finance minister and voted to remove him from office.

WASHINGTON: Three civilian aircraft reportedly violated the airspace above US President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, prompting the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) to scramble F-16 fighter jets, according to the Daily Mail.The fighter jets deployed flares and escorted the planes out of the restricted airspace, the report said. It remains unclear why the aircraft entered Palm Beach airspace, though similar incidents have occurred in recent weeks.According to Palm Beach Post, three airspace violations took place during Trump’s visit to Mar-a-Lago in February. Two violations occurred on February 15, while another took place on Presidents Day, February 17. There were also reports of F-16s responding to airspace breaches over Wellington, an inland community, and another civilian aircraft flying into Palm Beach on February 18.NORAD, in its response, stated that the flares used during such incidents are “employed with the highest regard for safety, burn out quickly and completely, and pose no danger to people on the ground.”Meanwhile, Irish Star reported that Trump arrived at Mar-a-Lago after the fighter jets had dealt with the airspace violations.In a separate development, Trump claimed that boxes of classified documents seized from his Mar-a-Lago residence during a 2022 FBI investigation had been returned to him. According to AFP, Trump suggested that these documents, which were at the center of an inquiry into his handling of government records, could be displayed in his future presidential library.“The department just returned the boxes that Deranged Jack Smith made such a big deal about,” Trump posted on Truth Social, referring to Special Counsel Jack Smith, who led the case.“They are being brought down to Florida and will someday be part of the Trump Presidential Library,” he added.The Justice Department has not confirmed Trump’s claim regarding the return of the documents.","Three civilian aircraft reportedly violated the airspace above US President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.

Elon Musk Cold Open - SNL

"" Saturday Night Live "" (SNL) took a satirical swing at US President Donald Trump’s recent meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a skit featuring James Austin Johnson as Trump, Bowen Yang as Vice President JD Vance, and Mikey Day as Zelenskyy.The show, which returned with its first new episode since the ""SNL50"" special, also featured an unexpected appearance by Mike Myers as Elon Musk, marking his first regular episode cameo since 2015.The sketch mocked the reported tensions between Trump and Zelenskyy, portraying their White House press conference as a chaotic exchange. The scene opened with a voice-over introducing the event: “Yesterday, President Trump hosted Ukrainian President Zelenskyy at the White House, and it went really, really well. Everyone who watched felt at ease and thought the world is now a safer place.”Johnson’s Trump quipped, “It is I, president and CEO of Gaza Hotel and Casino, Donald Trump, and I’d like to welcome President Zelenskyy here to this incredible trap. It’s going to be a big, beautiful trap, and we’re going to attack him very soon for no reason, right?”Bowen Yang’s Vance jumped in, berating Zelenskyy for not expressing enough gratitude: “I could jump in here, because that’s how we planned this. What happened to ‘thank you’? Remember ‘thank you’? You haven’t said ‘thank you’ to us once the past 15 seconds I’ve been yelling at you! You didn’t say it now, but you didn’t say it now. When you walked in here, you didn’t say thank you.”The sketch then introduced Myers as Elon Musk, who arrived wearing jeans and a T-shirt, prompting Trump to shift his stance on dress code. “We love your outfit. Very official and respectful,” Johnson’s Trump said, contradicting his earlier criticism of Zelenskyy’s casual attire.Myers’ Musk joked, “Thanks, Donald, what are you doing in my office? You know, I’m the president now, right? I’m kidding. I’m kidding. Maybe not?” The skit continued with Musk discussing mass firings and government cutbacks, referencing a controversial restructuring plan.The segment also touched on the recent release of the ""Epstein Files,"" with Trump’s character saying, “And to cap off an amazing week, we’re going to finally release the Epstein Files. Yes, America is going to see all the names, from A to S. No T.”The parody followed reports of a heated real-life encounter between Trump, Vance, and Zelenskyy at the White House, during which Trump and Vance allegedly repeated Russian talking points and pressed Ukraine to make concessions. The actual meeting reportedly devolved into a tense argument over U.S. aid to Ukraine.Shane Gillis hosted this week's episode, marking his second time leading SNL since his initial controversy-laden departure from the show in 2019. Musical guest Tate McRae also made her second appearance on the show. Looking ahead, pop icon Lady Gaga is set to double as host and musical guest next week.This marked the first new episode since ""SNL50: The Anniversary Special,"" which aired on February 16 and drew 14.8 million live viewers, significantly surpassing the show’s season average of 4.9 million. The show’s return continued the momentum generated by its milestone celebration.","Saturday Night Live took a satirical swing at US President Donald Trump’s recent meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a skit.

Who are the Zizians?



Richard and Rita Zajko were found shot dead in their home in Chester Heights on December 31, 2022. Their daughter, Michelle Zajko , became a person of interest after authorities discovered her links to individuals associated with the Zizians . She was questioned but refused to cooperate and later fled a Pennsylvania State Police barracks, abandoning her vehicle and $40,000 in cash, NBCNews.com reported.For nearly two years, the case remained unsolved. However, recent developments have reignited attention, particularly after Zajko and two associates were arrested in Maryland on trespassing and weapons charges. A prosecutor revealed in court that they were part of a group ""tied to multiple homicides that have occurred across the United States.""NBCNews.com reported that the Zizians originated from the rationalist community in Berkeley, California, and have been linked to at least six violent deaths. Members have been implicated in crimes ranging from a samurai sword attack in California to the murder of an elderly man scheduled to testify against them. The group is reportedly led by Alaskan computer scientist and blogger Jack ""Ziz"" LaSota, who identifies as female. LaSota was among those questioned in the Zajkos’ murder investigation and was later arrested in Maryland alongside Zajko.While no charges have been filed in the Zajkos’ murder, their family and friends remain hopeful. “Hopefully, there will finally be justice for Rich and Rita,” a family friend told NBCNews.com.The Zizians, an enigmatic group with roots in Berkeley’s rationalist community, are now under scrutiny for their alleged involvement in multiple violent crimes across the United States. Prosecutors have linked the group to at least six violent deaths, including cases in Pennsylvania, Vermont, and California.On December 31, 2022, Richard and Rita Zajko were found shot dead in their Chester Heights home. Their daughter, Michelle Zajko, quickly became a person of interest but managed to evade authorities for nearly two years. While no one has been charged in their murders, prosecutors say Zajko and two associates—also linked to the Zizians—were arrested in Maryland on trespassing and weapons charges.Among those arrested was Jack ""Ziz"" LaSota, the alleged leader of the group, along with another associate, Daniel Blank. “They were part of a group tied to multiple homicides across the United States,” a prosecutor said in court.The Zizians have been connected to a series of violent incidents across the country:Two Zizian members, Ophelia Bauckholt and Teresa Youngblut, were involved in a shootout with Border Patrol agents, resulting in the death of agent David Maland. Bauckholt was killed in the exchange, while Youngblut was wounded and later arrested.A samurai sword attack left one group member dead after their intended victim—an elderly man—shot back in self-defense.The survivor of the samurai attack, Curtis Lind, was later fatally stabbed outside his home. Another Zizian member has since been charged in his murder.Emerging from Berkeley’s rationalist community, the Zizians present themselves as intellectuals focused on existential threats such as artificial intelligence. However, law enforcement officials have linked them to multiple violent crimes, raising questions about whether they function as an organized criminal network or a loosely connected movement.Authorities continue to investigate the group’s structure and motivations, while prosecutors work to uncover the full extent of its influence. For the families of the victims, the search for justice continues. “We still have no answers,” a family friend of the murdered Zajkos said. “Hopefully, there will finally be justice for Rich and Rita.”","Richard and Rita Zajko were found shot dead in their Pennsylvania home on December 31, 2022.

Grammy-nominated R&B singer Angie Stone , known for hits like Wish I Didn’t Miss You and No More Rain (In This Cloud), died in a car crash early Saturday. She was 63.Stone was traveling back to Atlanta from Alabama when the vehicle she was riding in overturned and was struck by a big rig around 4 am, her longtime manager Walter Millsap III told The Associated Press. While others in the van survived, Stone succumbed to her injuries.Her children, Diamond and Michael Archer, expressed their grief in a statement shared by the SRG Group: “Never in a million years did we ever expect to get this horrible news. We are still trying to process and are completely heartbroken.”Millsap described the loss as “an unexpected and unfortunate tragedy,” adding, “there are simply no words to express how we feel.”Stone had been scheduled to perform at the halftime show of the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association (CIAA) men’s championship basketball game on Saturday. CIAA Chaplain Pastor Jerome Barber led a moment of silence in her honour. Commissioner Jacqie McWilliams-Parker said the league was “heartbroken by the loss” and praised Stone for using her talent to “inspire and touch us with strength and hope.”A trailblazer in hip-hop and R&B, Stone first gained recognition as a member of The Sequence, the pioneering all-female rap trio signed to Sugar Hill Records. Their song Funk You Up became a hip-hop classic, later sampled by artists such as Dr. Dre. She later joined the R&B trio Vertical Hold before launching a successful solo career.Stone was a key figure in the neo-soul movement of the early 2000s alongside Erykah Badu, Jill Scott, Maxwell, and D’Angelo. Her 2001 album Mahogany Soul reached No. 22 on the Billboard 200, while The Art of Love & War (2007) peaked at No. 11. Her collaboration Baby with Betty Wright became a chart-topping hit.Beyond music, Stone ventured into acting, appearing in films such as The Hot Chick, The Fighting Temptations, and Ride Along. She also performed on Broadway in Chicago and appeared on reality shows including Celebrity Fit Club and R&B Divas: Atlanta.Born in Columbia, South Carolina, Stone’s legacy spans decades, from hip-hop’s early days to modern R&B. Her influence, both as a solo artist and as part of The Sequence, remains a defining part of music history.","Stone was traveling back to Atlanta from Alabama when the vehicle she was riding in overturned and was struck by a big rig.

Vice President JD Vance was heckled as a "" Putin's puppet "" while skiing in Vermont over the weekend, as protesters gathered to voice their anger following his tense confrontation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office. Demonstrators accused Vance of siding with Russia, with some calling for him to ""go ski in Russia.""Hundreds of protesters lined the roads near Sugarbush Resort in Warren, Vermont, where Vance and his family were staying. Many carried pro-Ukraine signs, while others waved Palestinian flags and banners advocating for immigrant rights. The protests erupted just a day after Vance's heated exchange with Zelenskyy, during which he accused the Ukrainian leader of failing to acknowledge US financial aid and dismissed concerns about Russia’s trustworthiness.“Ski Russia because JD Vance has no friends in Vermont, but he’s got lots of friends in Russia, so he should go there for vacation,” Tekla Van Hoven, a protester from Waterbury, told WCAX-TV. Others held placards labelling him a ""traitor.""The protests were planned in advance but intensified following the Oval Office confrontation, which saw Trump and Vance take a hardline stance against continued US support for Ukraine. The meeting reportedly turned into a shouting match, with Trump ultimately cancelling a scheduled lunch and press conference with Zelenskyy.While a smaller group of Trump and Vance supporters held a “welcome rally,” the anti-Vance sentiment dominated the scene. Vermont’s Republican Governor Phil Scott had urged residents to show respect, stating, “I hope Vermonters remember the vice president is here on a family trip with his young children and, while we may not always agree, we should be respectful.”Vance’s stance on Ukraine has been controversial for years. As a Senate candidate in 2022, he dismissed US involvement in the conflict, saying he “didn’t care” what happened to Ukraine. His recent argument with Zelenskyy have reinforced his isolationist views, aligning with Trump’s efforts to pursue a diplomatic deal with Russia.As protests swelled in Vermont, Fox News reported that Vance and his family were moved to an undisclosed location for security reasons. The White House has not commented on the incident.","Hundreds of protesters lined the roads near Sugarbush Resort in Warren, Vermont, where Vance and his family were staying.

Defence secretary Pete Hegseth halts US cyber operations against Russia sparking national security concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/defence-secretary-pete-hegseth-halts-us-cyber-operations-against-russia-sparking-national-security-concerns/articleshow/118670943.cms,"Picture: The New York Times

Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered US Cyber Command to stop all offensive cyber operations against Russia on Sunday, reported The New York Times.The decision is reportedly part of a broader attempt to bring Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiation table regarding Ukraine.Intelligence experts argue that retaining access to Russian networks is vital for understanding Putin’s strategies and tracking internal Russian discussions about Ukraine. Former officials say it is not unusual to pause military operations during sensitive diplomatic negotiations to prevent disruptions.However, the order has sparked criticism, with concerns over national security and Russian cyber threats. Critics say halting cyber operations against Russia is a risky move. It assumes Putin will reciprocate by scaling back Russia’s cyber activities against the US and its allies.Russia has long been accused of cyber warfare, including interference in US elections, ransomware attacks, and sabotage efforts across Europe. In the past year, Russian-linked cybercriminals have been blamed for attacks on US hospitals and infrastructure.European nations rely on US cyber support to counter these threats, but with this policy shift, they may need to depend more on Britain’s Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) and Canadian intelligence.Meanwhile, the Trump administration has been rolling back efforts to counter Russian influence operations, including FBI-led initiatives to monitor propaganda.Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday stressed the importance of bringing Russia to the negotiating table over Ukraine. However, he became defensive when questioned about why the US was easing pressure on Moscow.""If this was a Democrat that was doing this, everyone would be saying, well, he's on his way to the Nobel Peace Prize,"" Rubio said. ""This is absurd. We are trying to end a war. You cannot end a war unless both sides come to the table, starting with the Russians, and that is the point the president has made. And we have to do whatever we can to try to bring them to the table to see if it's even possible,"" he added.",Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered US Cyber Command to stop all offensive cyber operations against Russia on Sunday.

Under restrictions imposed by the Biden administration, US military and CIA drone operators generally had to obtain permission from the White House to target a suspected militant outside a conventional war zone.Now commanders in the field will again have greater latitude to decide for themselves whether to carry out a strike. The relaxation of the rules suggests that the US is likely to more frequently carry out airstrikes aimed at killing terrorism suspects in poorly governed places that are not deemed traditional battlefield zones, like Somalia and Yemen. It also means there may be greater risk to civilians.

"Elon Musk’s bold allegation: ‘Billionaire enemies like Gates, Clinton, Hoffman hiding Epstein’s secrets, targeting Trump’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musks-bold-allegation-billionaire-enemies-like-gates-clinton-hoffman-hiding-epsteins-secrets-targeting-trump/articleshow/118668351.cms,"Hoffman’s ties to Epstein have been a subject of speculation for years, and Musk fanned the flames, alleging that billionaires like him were working behind the scenes to control the narrative.

""They don’t want you to see it""

Musk vs. the establishment

A high-stakes battle for power?

Elon Musk is no stranger to controversy, but his latest revelations on Joe Rogan’s podcast sent shockwaves through political and tech circles. With an air of defiance, Musk accused some of the world’s most powerful figures—Bill Clinton, Bill Gates, and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman—of desperately trying to suppress the release of Jeffrey Epstein’s infamous client list.“Known Epstein clients who are obviously extremely powerful – powerful politically and very wealthy – are Bill Gates, Bill Clinton, and Reid Hoffman. And some others, too. But those three,” Musk declared, his voice steady but brimming with implication.His claims came shortly after Attorney General Pam Bondi’s “first phase” release of Epstein-related documents. But instead of the bombshell revelations many expected, the files offered little new information—leading to whispers of a cover-up. Among MAGA circles, frustration boiled over, with conspiracy theories swirling that the real truth was still being kept from the public.Musk didn’t stop there. He pointed directly at Hoffman, alleging that the tech billionaire was not only a key Democratic donor but had also funded columnist E. Jean Carroll’s lawsuit against Donald Trump.“That lawsuit was funded by Reid Hoffman, who is a major Dem donor and also an Epstein client,” Musk said bluntly, suggesting that the lawsuit’s true purpose was to keep Trump out of the White House—and to ensure Epstein’s secrets remained buried.Hoffman’s ties to Epstein have been a subject of speculation for years, and Musk fanned the flames, alleging that billionaires like him were working behind the scenes to control the narrative.This isn’t the first time Musk has hinted at something bigger lurking beneath the surface. In an interview with Tucker Carlson, he suggested that Hoffman was part of the elite circle backing Kamala Harris—billionaires who were, in Musk’s words, “terrified” of what might come to light if Epstein’s files were fully unsealed.While no concrete evidence has emerged to support Musk’s claims, the allegations—true or not—have thrown fuel onto an already raging fire. The Epstein saga remains one of the most mysterious and politically explosive scandals of the decade, and with Musk stepping into the fray, it’s far from over.","Elon Musk accused Bill Clinton, Bill Gates, and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman of trying to suppress the release of Jeffrey Epstein’s infamous client list.

Tulsi Gabbard rips Europe’s ‘double standard’ after explosive Trump-Zelenskyy meeting: ‘They don’t stand for freedom’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tulsi-gabbard-rips-europes-double-standard-after-explosive-trump-zelenskyy-meeting-they-dont-stand-for-freedom/articleshow/118668319.cms,"A storm is brewing between the US and its European allies following a heated confrontation at the White House between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The fallout has exposed deep rifts over the future of the war, with Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard accusing Europe of straying from core American values of freedom and peace.Gabbard didn’t hold back in her interview on Fox News Sunday, slamming European nations for what she called their hypocrisy in supporting Ukraine’s prolonged war while claiming to stand for democracy. ""There's something fundamentally deeper here that shows a huge difference and divergence between the values that President Trump and Vice President Vance are fighting for… versus those of many of these European countries who are coming to Zelenskyy’s side,"" she declared. ""They claim to champion freedom, but their actions tell a different story.""The White House meeting turned into a diplomatic standoff. Trump, reportedly frustrated with Zelenskyy’s posture, delivered an ultimatum: ""You're either going to make a deal, or we're out. And if we're out, you'll fight it out. But you don’t have the cards."" Vice President JD Vance pressed Zelenskyy on whether he was grateful for the billions in US aid—implying that continued support was not guaranteed.As tensions escalated, Trump abruptly ended the meeting, leaving Zelenskyy to seek support elsewhere. The Ukrainian leader wasted no time, jetting to the UK, where Prime Minister Keir Starmer embraced him, signaling that Britain and France were now leading the charge on a peace proposal . European leaders gathered in London on Sunday, determined to move forward without waiting for Washington’s blessing.Gabbard seized on the moment, calling out what she saw as a stark contrast between the US and its European allies. ""They are standing against Putin, obviously. But what are they actually fighting for? Are they truly aligned with the values of democracy and freedom, or are they just prolonging this war for their own interests?"" she asked.She pointed to troubling signs of authoritarianism within Ukraine, citing crackdowns on political opposition, media control, and canceled elections. ""The reality in Ukraine is the exact opposite of what they claim to be fighting for,"" she asserted. ""And Europe is enabling it.""Meanwhile, behind closed doors, Trump’s team was reportedly pushing for a deal granting the US access to Ukraine’s vast mineral resources in exchange for continued support. Zelenskyy, however, was resistant—adding another layer of friction to an already explosive meeting.Zelenskyy addressed the controversy in an interview with Fox News’ Bret Baier, sidestepping direct criticism of Trump but making it clear he was not about to apologize. ""I'm very thankful to Americans for all your support,"" he said, before adding, ""I respect the president, and I respect the American people … I think we have to be very open and very honest, and I'm not sure that we did something bad.""",Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard slammed European nations for supporting Ukraine's prolonged war.

History repeats itself in the Trump era

The gratitude question

Same pattern, different president

A tense Oval Office exchange between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has reignited an old but telling revelation—Trump isn’t the first US commander-in-chief to grow frustrated with the wartime leader. A resurfaced NBC News report from 2022 details a fiery phone call between then-President Joe Biden and Zelenskyy, in which Biden allegedly lost his temper, demanding that Ukraine “show a little more gratitude.”The June 2022 call, made just months after Russia’s full-scale invasion, reportedly turned sour after Biden informed Zelenskyy of another $1 billion in US military aid. Instead of expressing thanks, Zelenskyy immediately began listing more requests—prompting Biden to raise his voice.“The American people were being quite generous,” Biden reportedly snapped. “Zelenskyy could show a little more gratitude.”The report, published in November 2022, underscores a recurring theme in US-Ukraine relations: the growing impatience of American leaders who, despite pouring billions into Ukraine’s war effort, have found Zelenskyy’s approach increasingly grating.Fast-forward to 2025, and Trump’s handling of Zelenskyy’s latest White House visit appears to be history repeating itself—only this time, the confrontation happened in person. In a dramatic meeting that ended with Zelenskyy being asked to leave, Trump and Vice President JD Vance took turns pressing the Ukrainian leader on his attitude toward US assistance.“Have you said thank you once this entire meeting?” Vance challenged Zelenskyy, calling out his past visit to Pennsylvania to campaign for Trump’s political opponents.Tensions escalated further when Trump accused Zelenskyy of “gambling with World War III” and warned that Ukraine must “make a deal” or risk losing US support. The confrontation ended with a visibly frustrated Trump canceling a scheduled press conference with Zelenskyy and scrapping a separate DC, speaking engagement for the Ukrainian president.Zelenskyy, facing mounting pressure to acknowledge US support more explicitly, later addressed the controversy in an interview with Fox News’ Bret Baier. While he expressed appreciation for American aid, he stopped short of offering an apology.“No, I respect the president and I respect the American people,” Zelenskyy stated when pressed on whether he owed Trump an apology.Meanwhile, European leaders, sensing a shift in US support, have begun stepping up their own diplomatic efforts. Over the weekend, Zelenskyy met with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer to discuss a new peace initiative, with France and the UK now taking the lead in brokering a deal.As Zelenskyy navigates yet another strained relationship with a US president, one thing is clear: whether it’s Biden or Trump, the world’s most powerful leaders are growing weary of what they see as Ukraine’s endless demands. And with Trump now in office, the consequences of that frustration could be far more immediate—and severe.","A resurfaced NBC News report from 2022 details a fiery phone call between then- President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

ISLAMABAD: At least five people were killed and 20 injured in a suicide blast at a mosque of an Islamic religious school known as the “university of jihad” in Nowshera district of Pakistan’s northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province on Friday.Among the dead were Maulana Hamid-ul-Haq Haqqani , head of Dar-ul-Uloom Haqqania school, the seminary in Nowshera’s Akora Khattak town where key Afghan Taliban leaders have studied. Mullah Omer, the slain founder of the Taliban movement in Afghanistan, was also an alumni of this religious school.Graduates of the seminary include current Afghan Taliban leaders Amir Khan Muttaqi, Sirajuddin Haqqani, Abdul Latif Mansoor, Maulvi Ahmad Jan, Mullah Jalaludin Haqani, Maulvi Qalamudin, Arifullah Arif and Mullah Khairullah Khairkhwa.The explosion occurred in the main prayer hall as people gathered for weekly Friday prayers were leaving the mosque.KP police chief Zulfiqar Hameed confirmed that it was a suicide attack and that three policemen were also injured. “More than a dozen police officers were guarding the mosque when the attack occurred, and Haq’s seminary also had its own security,” he said.“It appears that Hamid Haqqani (seminary’s slain chief) was the target,” Hameed added.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack, which came on the last Friday ahead of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.Yawar Zia, a police constable, who was injured in the attack, said he was on security duty at the seminary when the blast happened and splinters hit him. “After offering prayer, Hamid-ul-Haq, accompanied by his guards, was leaving the mosque when the powerful explosion occurred,” the wounded official said.Eyewitnesses described a chaotic scene, with blood and body parts scattered all over the place. They said the casualties could have been much higher had the bomber struck during the prayers.Haqqani, the son of slain prominent Pakistani cleric Sami-ul-Haq Haqqani, known as the “father of Taliban, was a vice-chancellor of the sprawling seminary, located 60 km from the provincial capital of Peshawar. Following his father’s assassination in 2018, he also became chairman of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Sami (JUI-S) political party. He had also previously served as a member of the National Assembly from 2002 to 2007.Haq was also among the few who called on the world and Pakistan to immediately recognise the Taliban govt and establish diplomatic relations with Afghanistan after the fall of Kabul in 2021.Last year, he led a delegation of religious scholars to Afghanistan for “religious diplomacy” meetings with Taliban leaders.His seminary had faced controversy in the past as its students were accused of involvement in the assassination of Pakistan’s former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto. The madrasa, however, denied any connection with the suspects.","At least five people were killed and 20 injured in a suicide blast at a mosque.

China has signed an agreement with Pakistan to send a Pakistani astronaut to its space station, Tiangong , marking the first time a foreign national will be aboard the facility.The deal was signed in a ceremony held in Islamabad on Friday, between the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) and Pakistan’s Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO). Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was alos present during the ceremony.According to a statement by CMSA, both nations will collaborate on selecting and training Pakistani astronauts, with the chosen candidate expected to join Chinese taikonauts for a short-term mission in the coming years.""This signifies a major step in China’s international space cooperation ,"" reported Global Times, highlighting the growing partnership between Beijing and Islamabad in aerospace advancements.China’s space station, which has been operational for nearly four years, was built after the country was reportedly excluded from the International Space Station (ISS) due to concerns over the involvement of China’s military in its space programme.The station is also seen as a new frontier of competition between China and the US.As per the news agency PTI, the agreement further solidifies China’s support for Pakistan’s space ambitions, following previous collaborations such as the launch of Pakistani satellites.Pakistan’s first digital communications satellite, Badr-1, was launched aboard a Chinese Long March 2E rocket in 1990, while earlier this year, Pakistan’s CubeSat accompanied China’s Chang’e-6 probe to the Moon.According to Global Times, the selection of the astronaut is expected to take around a year, after which the candidate will undergo intensive training in China. This move, experts say, demonstrates the reliability of China's manned space technology and its willingness to lower barriers for developing countries to participate in space exploration .China has also set ambitious goals for space exploration, with plans to land astronauts on the Moon before 2030.Meanwhile, the US has its sights set on returning to the lunar surface by 2025.","China has signed an agreement with Pakistan to send a Pakistani astronaut to its space station, Tiangong.

Clock running out for refugees in Islamabad, Rawalpindi



'We've worked with the Americans for years'



Kabul, Islamabad row amid rising crackdown



Forced to move after decades in Pakistan



UN says Pakistan has a tradition of protecting Afghans

A woman who we will call Fatima fled Afghanistan with her family in December 2021. She had worked for an American non-profit organization in Kabul ­until the US pullout in the summer of 2021, when the Taliban retook control of the country.She is now based in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad. And she is in trouble. Her Pakistani visa is days away from expiring, and the authorities are still processing her renewal application.""I am concerned about the renewal of my visa, and if not renewed timely authorities would arrest me and my family for illegally residing in the country,"" Fatima told DW.Police, including female officers, recently conducted a raid on a building where Fatima lives, looking for undocumented Afghan refugees. She was not in the building at the time, but her brother ended up in custody.""Later, we showed them our visa renewal application receipts and proof but police did not cooperate,"" said Fatima, who is now hiding from the authorities.In 2023, Pakistan started a massive initiative to repatriate approximately 4 million Afghans who have entered the country over the past 40 years. And while the authorities granted some leeway last year, Pakistan's government has now set a March 31 deadline to expel foreign nationals residing in the country illegally, with search operations ongoing in January and February.Afghan refugees living in Islamabad and the nearby city of Rawalpindi ""have been verbally asked to leave Pakistan till 28th February,"" Umer Gillani, a legal expert and rights activist, told DW.Moniza Kakar, a lawyer working for refugees advocacy in Pakistan, said there was ""uncertainty and fear"" among the Afghani nationals in the area.""Since the start of this year, over 1,000 Afghans have been detained in Islamabad, and more than 18,000 have been forced to leave Islamabad and Rawalpindi because of government orders,"" she said.Amin, 28, is from Kabul. He spent years collaborating with the United States in the fight against the Taliban in Afghanistan, before he too had to flee across the Pakistani border.Hee said he was just days away from being evacuated to America, but this was put on hold last month with President Donald Trump signing an executive order to suspend a refugee resettlement program.Nearly 20,000 Afghans are presently waiting in Pakistan for approval to resettle in the US through an American government program.""We've worked with the Americans for years, we helped and supported them in Afghanistan, we have given them a part of our lives and they have to support us so that we can live peacefully,"" Amin told DW.Over the last three years, Pakistan's relationship with neighboring Afghanistan has deteriorated. Islamabad holds the Taliban authorities in Afghanistan responsible for their inability to control the operations of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group that formed in 2007 and has conducted numerous attacks on Pakistani security forces.As cross-border tensions with the Taliban regime escalate, concerns were also raised about the well-being of Afghans in Pakistan amid reports of purported intimidation and arrests. The UN special rapporteur has expressed his worries, stating that Afghans in the area deserve more humane treatment.Activist Gilani said millions of Afghan refugees in Pakistan are being used as ""hostages to build pressure whenever there is tension between the two countries.""Last week, Pakistan's Foreign Ministry dismissed claims made by the Afghan representation regarding the mistreatment of Afghan refugees in Pakistan, labeling these allegations as ""misplaced"" and urging Kabul to facilitate the smooth repatriation of Afghan citizens.Pakistan has accommodated hundreds of thousands of refugees from its northern neighbor, a situation resulting from decades of regional instability. Afghans who arrived in Pakistan following the Taliban takeover in August 2021 have been relying on visa renewals to stay in the country, a procedure that is costly, uncertain and often subject to significant delays.""The stories of refugees are devastating. Families who have lived in Pakistan for years, even decades, are now being uprooted due to tensions between the two countries. Children, women, and men who have already suffered so much are being treated as if they don't matter. This is not just a refugee crisis, it's a humanitarian crisis,"" said Kakar.UNHCR's top representative in Pakistan, Philippa Candler, told DW that Pakistan already repatriated over 800,000 Afghan refugees between September 2023 and the end of last year.""As of December 2024, Pakistan hosted over 2.8 million Afghans with 69% of refugees living outside refugee villages,"" she said.Candler acknowledged Pakistan's generosity in hosting Afghan refugees for decades, and the current ""economic and security challenges"" in Pakistan that drive the repatriation efforts.At the same time, UNHCR was urging the Islamabad government to ""see the situation of Afghans through a humanitarian perspective"" and ""continue its long-standing tradition of protecting vulnerable Afghans […] regardless of their status.""""It's essential that we work hand-in-hand with both host countries and countries of origin to develop mechanisms that empower refugees to rebuild their lives in safety and dignity, including voluntary repatriation,"" she said.""We are calling for dialogue between the two countries, and for the refugee issue to be separated from political matters.""","Afghan refugees living in Islamabad and the nearby city of Rawalpindi are in trouble.

New York City is terminating a $220m deal with the Pakistan-owned Roosevelt Hotel to house a migrant shelter following a prolonged MAGA meltdown over use of American taxpayer money to facilitate immigration to the US.Under pressure from the federal government and MAGA hardliners, Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat who gravitated to the Trump orbit after facing corruption charges from the Biden administration, announced closure of the site that is said to have housed tens of thousands of migrants in its 1025 rooms at $ 200 a night.The site opened in May 2023 to serve as both a new arrivals center and shelter for asylum seekers under a three-year $ 220 million deal with government-run Pakistan International Airlines, which owns the hotel, having bought out a Saudi stake in it for $ 36.4million in 2005.At peak traffic in 2023 when around 4000 migrants were arriving in the city each week, the sight of asylum seekers camping outside the hotel waiting to be processed triggered MAGA hardliners and even some New Yorkers, as Trump and his supporters complained about Democrats housing ""illegal immigrants"" in ""luxury hotels"" at the expense of US taxpayers.""A taxpayer-funded hotel for illegal migrants is owned by the Pakistani government, which means NYC taxpayers are effectively paying a foreign government to house illegals in our own country. This is nuts,"" Trump acolyte and MAGA major Vivel Ramaswamy had raged.Trump himself, lately exercised over a $ 21 million USAID allocation for a voter turnout program in India, had highlighted the purported scam saying the Biden administration had paid $ 59 million to an unspecified hotel in New York City to house illegal immigrants. Standing beside him, Musk had added that the city was paying double the normal rate for the room.Following the Trump victory, his new administration cited concerns about criminal activity at the hotel for freezing $80 million in FEMA funds to the city, by which time Pakistan had already raked in tens of millions of dollars.""FEMA was funding the Roosevelt Hotel that serves as a Tren de Aragua base of operations and was used to house Laken Riley's killer. There will not be a single penny spent that goes against the interest and safety of the American people,"" the homeland security department said, referring to the Venezuelan criminal gang, now declared a foreign terrorist organisation, said to be involved in the murder of an American nursing student.",New York City is terminating a $220m deal with the Pakistan-owned Roosevelt Hotel to house a migrant shelter.

"No passengers, no planes: China-funded $240m Gwadar airport sits idle",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/no-passengers-no-planes-china-funded-240m-gwadar-airport-sits-idle/articleshow/118512631.cms,"Gwadar airport in Pakistan (Pic credit: AP)

With no passengers and no planes, Pakistan's newest and most expensive airport is a bit of a mystery. Entirely financed by China to the tune of $240 million, it's anyone's guess when New Gwadar International Airport will open for business. Located in the coastal city of Gwadar and completed in Oct 2024, its a stark contrast to the impoverished, restive southwestern Balochistan province around it.For the past decade, China has poured money into Balochistan and Gwadar as part of a multibillion dollar project that connects its western Xinjiang province with Arabian Sea, called the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor or CPEC.Authorities have hailed it as transformational but there's scant evidence of change in Gwadar. The city isn't connected to the national grid - electricity comes from Iran or solar panels - and there isn't enough clean water. An airport with a 400,000 passenger capacity isn't a priority for the city's 90,000 people.""This airport is not for Pakistan or Gwadar,"" said Azeem Khalid, an international relations expert who specialises in Pakistan-China ties. ""It is for China, so they can have secure access for their citizens to Gwadar and Balochistan.""CPEC has catalysed a decadeslong insurgency in resource-rich and strategically located Balochistan. Separatists, aggrieved by what they say is state exploitation at the expense of locals, are fighting for independence - targeting Pakistani troops and Chinese workers in the province and elsewhere. Members of Pakistan's ethnic Baloch minority say they face discrimination by govt and are denied opportunities available elsewhere in the country, charges govt denies.Pakistan, keen to protect China's investments, has stepped up its military footprint in Gwadar to combat dissent. The city is a jumble of checkpoints, barbed wire, troops, barricades, and watchtowers. Roads close at any given time, several days a week, to permit the safe passage of Chinese workers and Pakistani VIPs.Intelligence officers monitor journalists visiting Gwadar. Its fish market is deemed too sensitive for coverage.Many locals are frazzled. ""Nobody used to ask where we are going, what we are doing, and what is your name,"" said Khuda Bakhsh Hashim, 76. ""We used to enjoy all-night picnics in the mountains or rural areas. We are residents. Those who ask should identify themselves as to who they are.""Hashim recalled when Gwadar was part of Oman, not Pakistan, and was a stop for passenger ships heading to Mumbai. People didn't go hungry and found work easily, he said.But Gwadar's water has dried up because of drought and unchecked exploitation. So has the work. Govt says CPEC has created some 2,000 local jobs but it's not clear whom they mean by ""local"" - Baloch residents or Pakistanis from elsewhere in the country. Authorities did not elaborate.There is a perception Gwadar is dangerous or difficult to visit - only one commercial route operates out of its domestic airport, three times a week to Karachi, Pakistan's largest city. There are no direct flights to Balochistan's provincial capital of Quetta, or national capital of Islamabad.Security concerns delayed the inauguration of the international airport. There were fears the area's mountains - and their proximity to the airport - could be the ideal launchpad for an attack. Instead, PM Shehbaz Sharif and his Chinese counterpart Li Qiang hosted a virtual ceremony. The inaugural flight was off limits to media and public.","Gwadar is Pakistan's newest and most expensive airport. Entirely financed by China to the tune of $240 million.

ISLAMABAD: A mob enraged by a local’s murder over a trivial parking dispute snatched the suspect, a watchman, from police and lynched him in the mountainous Galiyat region of Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Sunday. Several police officers were wounded in the violence in a neighbourhood under the jurisdiction of Changla Gali police station, around 80km from Islamabad.Police said Imran Abbasi, a local, had parked his car in the designated area of a housing society and left for home. When he returned the next day, he got into a fight with the watchman, Khan Zaman, who allegedly stabbed him to death and wounded his brother.As word spread about the murder, a mob milled in the area and burned down five houses in the residential society.Police apprehended the culprit, who was hiding in the basement of a building, and were about to take him away when the mob swooped on him and beat him to death with sticks and stones.Lynchings are common in Pakistan and several instances of mob violence have taken place in the past decade. Many people have been lynched for alleged blasphemy, while mobs have also murdered suspects in street crimes.In June 2024, a suspected robber was lynched by a mob in the southern port city of Karachi. The suspect, armed with a pistol, had attempted to rob a citizen, who put up resistance and was joined by others standing nearby. The mob got hold of the suspect and hit him with blunt weapons, resulting in his death on the spot.In May 2024, another mob lynched a suspected robber in Karachi's Orangi town while police saved his accomplice from being killed.The same month, police rescued a Christian man from angry people, who wanted to lynch him and attacked the homes of other minority members in Punjab’s Sargodha district on charges of alleged blasphemy. Workers at a Sialkot garment factory tortured and burned to death their Sri Lankan general manager in 2023 for alleged blasphemy.","Imran Abbasi, a local, had parked his car in the designated area of a housing society and left for home.

No direct flight to Quetta or Islamabad

Militancy in Balochistan



Airport inauguration delayed due to security concerns



Pakistan’s newest airport in Gwadar, fully funded by China at a cost of $240 million, remains unused months after its completion in October 2024.Spread over 4,300 acres of land. the airport is Pakistan's largest international airport and was officially opened on January 20 this year. Work started on Gwadar airport in 2019.The Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) PK 503 aircraft was the first commercial flight to arrive at the new airport after its inauguration carrying commercial passengers and high-ranking officials.However, the airport, designed to handle 400,000 passengers annually, has no scheduled flights.The New Gwadar International Airport is part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ), a multi-billion dollar project aimed at linking China’s Xinjiang province with the Arabian Sea. While officials have called it a major development, many in Gwadar say they see little benefit.Gwadar, located in Pakistan's Balochistan province , lacks basic infrastructure such as a stable electricity supply and clean water.""This airport is not for Pakistan or Gwadar,"" Azeem Khalid, an expert in Pakistan-China relations was quoted as saying by the news agency Associated Press (AP). ""It is for China, so they can have secure access for their citizens to Gwadar and Balochistan.""The airport’s construction comes amid ongoing security challenges in Balochistan. Separatist groups in the province oppose what they call exploitation of local resources, targeting both Pakistani security forces and Chinese workers.Pakistan has increased its military presence in Gwadar to protect Chinese investments, leading to more checkpoints and restrictions on movement. Roads are often closed to ensure the safety of Chinese workers and high-ranking officials.""Nobody used to ask where we are going, what we are doing, and what is your name,"" 76-year-old Gwadar resident Khuda Bakhsh Hashim was quoted as saying by the AP. ""We are asked to prove our identity, who we are, where we have come from. We are residents. Those who ask should identify themselves as to who they are.""Authorities claim CPEC has created 2,000 jobs, but there is no clarity on whether these positions were given to local Baloch residents or people from other parts of Pakistan.Gwadar remains largely disconnected, with only one commercial flight route operating three times a week to Karachi. There are no direct flights to Quetta, the provincial capital, or Islamabad.Militancy in Balochistan has increased in recent years, with attacks rising after 2021. Groups such as the Baloch Liberation Army have carried out multiple attacks, particularly after the Pakistani Taliban ended a ceasefire in 2022.Earlier, the airport’s opening was postponed due to security risks. Authorities feared that nearby mountains could be used to launch attacks. Instead, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chinese Premier Li Qiang held a virtual inauguration. The first flight landed without media or public presence.Abdul Ghafoor Hoth, a local leader from the Balochistan Awami Party, said no local residents were hired to work at the airport.""Not a single resident of Gwadar was hired to work at the airport, not even as a watchman,"" he was quoted by AP.Hoth had led protests in December demanding better living conditions in Gwadar. The demonstrations lasted 47 days before authorities promised to address local concerns, including improved access to water and electricity. Since then, no progress has been made on these commitments.","Gwadar airport is Pakistan's largest international airport and was officially opened on January 20 this year.

Two police personnel and four militants were killed in an attack on a police check post in Pakistan’s southwestern Balochistan province on Friday.The attack came two days after the separatist Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed the killing of seven passengers, who hailed from Pakistan’s Punjab province, on a highway in the restive province.In the latest incident, police said that armed men stormed a police check post in Shaban area, some 35 km from the provincial capital Quetta, early on Friday morning, “killing two policemen and injuring two others”, local police station in-charge Munir Khan said.“The police force retaliated and killed four attackers,” Khan said, adding, “Search and clearance operations continued in the area as some terrorists fled to the nearby mountains.”Pakistan has been struggling to quell separatist attacks in Balochistan, which shares a porous border with Iran and Afghanistan.According to official figures, around 40 attacks against police in Balochistan in 2024 killed at least 25 police officers and injured 61 others. Last month, dozens of fighters of the separatist outfit wrested control of a small town in Khuzdar from paramilitary forces. Pakistani authorities regained the town after hours of effort.The separatists accuse Pakistan’s federal govt and military authorities of exploiting the natural resources of mineral-rich Balochistan for development elsewhere in the country, while neglecting the local population. The province has been the site of an insurgency for the last two decades, with separatists frequently attacking police, security forces, and civilians they see as “outsiders” in the region. The BLA also targets Chinese interests in the restive province.",Two police personnel and four militants were killed in an attack on a police check post in Pakistan’s southwestern Balochistan province on Friday.
