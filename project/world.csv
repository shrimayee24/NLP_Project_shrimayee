‘Targeting People Like Terrorists’: Mamata Banerjee Attacks EC Over SIR, Cites Bangladesh Polls

NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief secretary Nandini Chakravorty on Tuesday apprised the Election Commission about partial compliance of the commission's directions pending with the state govt—including filing of FIRs against four officers for violation of data security and suspension of the Basirhat assistant electoral registration officer (AERO) — within the Feb 17, 5.30 pm deadline set by the poll panel.However, compliance remains pending as regards EC direction dated Feb 13 to Chakravorty for cancellation of transfer orders issued by the state govt in respect of three electoral roll observers—Aswini Kumar yadav, Randhir Kumar, and Smita Pandey—without prior consultation with the poll panel. Also, the state govt is yet to send a proposal regarding appointment of returning officers (ROs) and electoral registration officer (EROs) as per criteria laid down by EC.The norms require them to be officers at the level of sub divisional magistrate (SDM), sub divisional officer (SDO) or revenue divisional officer. At present, ROs in only 67 of the state’s 294 assembly constituencies (ACs) and EROs in only 68 ACs are of the rank of SDO/SDM.Confirming receipt of the compliance letter from West Bengal chief secretary on Tuesday, EC sources told TOI that the commission, which is currently on a visit to Assam, ""shall examine the letter upon its return here"".Meanwhile, the West Bengal chief electoral officer, in a post on X on Tuesday, said he had suspended three micro observers, based on reports of EC-appointed district electoral roll observers. ""Electoral roll micro observers being under deputation to ECI are directed to perform their duties diligently and not to outsource/delegate their work to anyone else, failing which they will be liable for the consequences,"" he posted.Only on Sunday, the EC had suspended seven AEROs in the state with immediate effect, over ""dereliction of duty"".During its meeting with West Bengal chief secretary here last week, EC had asked the state administration to comply with its directions regarding payment of honorarium to BLOs, appointment of suitable SIR/poll-related officers, rescinding of unilateral transfer of roll observers and registration of FIRs against errant officers, latest by 5.30 pm on Feb 17.The February 17, 5.30 pm deadline set by EC, however, was not in respect of the pending honorarium dues.","West Bengal chief secretary Nandini Chakravorty on Tuesday apprised the Election Commission about partial compliance of the commission's directions pending with the state govt.

AHMEDABAD: Aspirations to walk tall and proud in khaki have ""shrunk"" after running into a tape measure.Several police job hopefuls in Gujarat have moved the high court after failing to rise to one's full height in the latest recruitment drive, falling below the mandatory 165cm (5.4ft) cut-off despite, reportedly, having earlier cleared the same benchmark.Confusion surfaced during the physical efficiency test, where candidates who had been measured at or above 165cm during a recruitment drive in 2024 were declared ineligible. Authorities, recently, said aspirants now fall short of the record.Among the petitioners: Tushar Bhaliya and Govind Sindhav of Gandhinagar, Pappu Parmar of Banaskantha, and Mukesh Chauhan of Ahmedabad. All had reapplied for different police posts and were previously cleared on height. This time, they got the short end of the stick.As petitions piled up before HC, Justice Nirzar Mehta added a filter: each petitioner must deposit Rs 10,000 with court registry, refundable if claim were correct.To settle the inches-versus-centimetres debate, HC ordered for a fresh measurement to be conducted under strict medical supervision.Candidates must appear Feb 19 at GMERS civil hospital in Sola, carrying proof of deposit. Concerned Hospital authorities have been directed to arrange the process and facilitate it.Transparency is non-negotiable in the process. The bench said ""the entire exercise be videographed and a report be produced before this court on the returnable date"" of Feb 23.","Aspirations to walk tall and proud in khaki have ""shrunk"" after running into a tape measure.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled that groping a female and untying her pyjama string constituted ""attempt to rape"" and set aside Allahabad HC's controversial judgment terming the offence not an ""attempt"" but ""preparation to commit rape"", which attracts less punishment, being categorised as outraging the modesty of a woman.The HC's March 17, 2025, judgment had created a furo-re and SC took suo motu cognisance of the case after a letter from NGO 'We the Women' through founder president and senior advocate Shobha Gupta.A bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and N V Anjaria set aside the HC judgment and revived the original stringent charge of attempt to rape against the two persons under Pocso Act.Referring to pleas by Gupta and senior advocate H S Phoolka for greater sensitivity in judges while dealing with sexual offences against women, the bench said, ""No judge or judgment of any court can be expected to do complete justice when it is inconsiderate towards the factual realities of a litigant and the vulnerabilities which they may be facing in approaching a court of law.""Writing the judgment, CJI Kant said the efforts of judges ""must not only be grounded in the sound application of constitutional and legal principles but also foster an environment of compassion and empathy. The absence of eit-her of these cornerstones wo-uld prevent judicial institutions from properly performing their critical duties.""The bench said, ""Our decisions as participants in the legal process, from laying down the procedure that shall have to be faced by common citizens to the final judgment passed in any given case, must reflect the ethos of compassion, humanity and understanding, which are essential for creating a fair and effective justice system.""SC said it had laid down principles to sensitise judges and so would refrain from taking an open-ended approach to devise fresh guidelines without guidance. It requested National Judicial Academy director Justice Aniruddha Bose to constitute a committee of experts to prepare a ""comprehensive report"" on 'Developing Guidelines to Inculcate Sensitivity and Compassion into Judges and Judicial Processes in the Context of Sexual Offences and other Vulnerable Cases'.""The guidelines, we expect, will not be loaded with heavy, complicated expressions borne from foreign languages and jurisdictions,"" said the CJI-led bench, which had termed then CJI D Y Cha-ndrachud's 'Handbook on Co-mbating gender Stereotypes' too ""Harvard-oriented"".","Supreme Court rules that groping a female and untying her pyjama string constituted ""attempt to rape"" Court sets aside Allahabad HC's controversial judgment terming the offence not an 'attempt' but ""preparation to commit rape"", which attracts less punishment.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128484198,imgsize-171096,width-400,resizemode-4/sc-collegium-approves-appointment-of-five-retired-judges-as-ad-hoc-judges-in-allahabad-hc.jpg"

NAGPUR: Maharashtra Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) Sunday raided 21 locations across multiple districts and busted an alleged radicalisation network operating under the garb of a soccer club. At the centre was a Nagpur-based grocer who allegedly used a club in Yavatmal's Pusad as a front to indoctrinate youth into 'jihadi' ideology.Preliminary findings indicated many suspects - projected as footballers - maintained contact with cross-border radical Islamic terror outfits. Intelligence sources said they were involved in online discussions promoting anti-India sentiments and pro-jihadi views. The grocer allegedly sent them, disguised as a football team, to radicalisation workshops in Kerala and West Bengal. Expensive flight tickets point to a well-organised, financially backed network aimed at grooming vulnerable youths through targeted meetings. ""This highlights a trend of exploiting recreational platforms to propagate extremist ideology,"" an official said.A Pusad native, the alleged mastermind had relocated to Jaffar Nagar.Police said his family's decades-old ties with radical Islamist outfits had put them on intelligence radar. He was detained and questioned, later released but remains under the scanner.During searches in Pusad and Ahilyanagar, ATS detained several suspects and seized phones, laptops and electronic devices.

JAMMU: J&K CM Omar Abdullah voiced a mix of hope and scepticism Tuesday after Union law minister Arjun Meghwal said a decision on restoring statehood to the Union territory would be announced “soon”, citing an assurance by home minister Amit Shah in Parliament.“One-and-a-half years have passed since an elected govt assumed office and we are still waiting,” Omar told reporters. “We hope we will not have to wait much longer.”Speaking after a function at Srinagar’s Sher-i-Kashmir International Conference Centre, Meghwal described statehood as “an important” and “very sensitive” question. “When the Union home minister has said in Parliament that you will get this right, then you will get it,” he said, adding that a process was underway.Omar said patience was wearing thin. “We will not be satisfied till we get it. The process is underway but it is taking far too long,” he said, adding that his govt remained in continuous engagement with Centre.The push comes nearly six years after Centre abrogated Article 370 on Aug 5, 2019, and split the former state into two UTs — J&K and Ladakh. On Dec 11, 2023, Supreme Court upheld the move while urging that J&K’s statehood be restored “as soon as possible”.Omar, who took office on Oct 16, 2024, has repeatedly raised the issue. On Aug 16 last year, he wrote to BJP and other parties, while urging Parliament to bring a bill to restore statehood.“The restoration must not be viewed as a concession,” his letter said, cautioning against a precedent where statehood becomes “a discretionary favour”. He said the delay carries implications for the country’s constitutional values and democratic ethos, citing the reduction of J&K’s status in 2019 and the prolonged wait for reversal.",J&K CM Omar Abdullah voiced a mix of hope and scepticism Tuesday.

Multiple aspects of plane crash raise apprehensions, says NCP

MUMBAI: Deputy CM Sunetra Pawar and other NCP members on Tuesday met CM Devendra Fadnavis and demanded a CBI probe into the Jan 28 air crash that killed Ajit Pawar NCP state chief Sunil Tatkare told reporters that the CM has assured them the state govt would communicate with the Union home ministry. ""The govt has already initiated a probe by independent agencies and has said it will order a CBI investigation. We feel a probe by the central agency would be comprehensive,"" Tatkare said. Sunetra Pawar, accompanied by her elder son Parth Pawar and others, handed over to the CM a letter seeking a CBI probe.Ajit Pawar and four others were killed in a crash in Baramati.In the letter, NCP stated, ""Multiple aspects surrounding the incident give rise to legitimate apprehensions requiring investigation by an independent central agency.""Among the ""substantial questions"" raised, the letter said, were the reported last-minute changes in flight crew composition which requires scrutiny of operational decision-making and authorisation, apparent anomalies concerning Air Traffic Control communications and sequencing of runway clearances, concerns regarding the functioning and integrity of critical onboard safety warning systems, absence of any recorded distress communication despite proximity to landing phase, and matters requiring forensic evaluation, including crew fitness, maintenance compliance, and aircraft systems.The party said that as the probe into the incident involves highly technical aviation, forensic, electronic, and operational considerations, the investigative powers, technical expertise, and inter-state jurisdictional capacity of CBI render it the most appropriate agency to conduct a comprehensive inquiry.A CBI probe would serve to reinforce confidence in the fairness and integrity of the investigative process and ensure that all aspects are examined without limitation, the letter stated.NCP highlighted that the nature of the incident transcends an ordinary accident and directly engages public confidence in aviation safety, regulatory oversight, and institutional accountability.The NCP legislature party is fully behind Sunetra Pawar and there is no dissent, Tatkare said.He said BJP state chief Ravindra Chavan met him at the NCP office and discussed the way forward for the Mahayuti alliance after its victory in the zilla parishad polls. He also said incidents such as bribery in NCP minister Narhari Zirwal's office malign the image of govt and ministers.","NCP state chief Sunil Tatkare said the state govt would communicate with the Union home ministry.

JAMMU: Amid outrage over the monkey menace destroying crops, Jammu and Kashmir govt on Tuesday informed the assembly it is not planning to launch a sterilisation drive to curb the simian population, even as it conceded that the threat remains a major headache across Jammu region.The govt, however, said a range of steps are being rolled out to tackle the problem, from pushing farmers towards monkey-resistant crops such as turmeric, ginger, and lemongrass to promoting boundary plantation of ladyfinger. Farmers are also being encouraged to install solar fencing, use monkey-deterrent devices and stop feeding the animals, the govt said.BJP’s Nagrota MLA Devyani Rana raised the issue in the assembly, stating that monkeys are ravaging crops in her constituency and posing a growing threat to public safety. She pressed for sterilisation, relocation, compensation and serious preventive interventions.Rana said that crop diversification may be a sound agricultural strategy, but farmers cannot be expected to absorb transition costs without institutional backing.“International and domestic experiences suggest that sterilisation must be large-scale, continuous and professionally monitored to produce a measurable demographic impact.Sporadic interventions yield negligible results,” she added.Official figures show that around 2,200 hectares of agricultural land in Nagrota alone have been affected by monkey-related crop damage, including fruit orchards.BJP MLA from Udhampur West, Pawan Gupta, warned that failure to launch a monkey sterilisation programme would lead to a serious situation in Jammu. “Thousands of kanals of land in my constituency are lying vacant because farmers are afraid to grow crops due to monkeys. Even at my own house in Udhampur, 40 to 50 monkeys gather every evening,” Gupta said.“It is said animals sleep in the evening, but these monkeys don’t. They should be moved back towards forest areas,” he said, adding that govt inaction would force many more farmers to abandon agriculture.","Jammu and Kashmir govt says it is not planning to launch a sterilisation drive to curb the simian population.

Sanjay Raut Raises Doubts Over Ajit Pawar Plane Crash, Seeks Thorough Probe

NEW DELHI: The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) on Tuesday demanded a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the death of former Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, who died in a plane crash in Baramati last month.A delegation of senior party leaders, including his wife Sunetra Pawar, NCP National Working President and MP Praful Patel, State President and MP Sunil Tatkare, Maharashtra medical education minister Hasan Mushrif and youth leader Parth Pawar, submitted a memorandum to chief minister Devendra Fadnavis seeking a CBI-led investigation.Ajit Pawar and four others were killed on the morning of January 28 when the aircraft carrying them crashed while attempting to land at the Baramati airport in Pune district. The incident has since triggered political controversy, with the NCP (SP), along with Shiv Sena (UBT) and the Indian National Congress, raising questions and alleging possible “foul play”.Earlier in the day, NCP (SP) MP Supriya Sule said that there was growing unease over the circumstances surrounding Pawar’s death and that the civil aviation ministry should clarify the facts.“Ajit Pawar was Rohit Pawar’s uncle. Rohit Pawar, along with several others, has concerns and uneasiness regarding this matter.Amol Mitkari has also raised questions. Shiv Sena (UBT) and the Congress have fully supported us. They have said that this issue should be discussed in Parliament and even met the Speaker in this regard. There are many questions in the minds of the people, and they deserve answers,” Sule said.NCP (SP) MLA Rohit Pawar criticised the pace of the investigation, alleging that nearly 20 days after the crash, there had been little visible progress.“20 days have passed since the unfortunate accident, yet the investigation hasn't gained any momentum. Is the delay solely to allow the VSR company to destroy evidence or does the company have someone's protection? This question has arisen in the minds of common citizens. The information emerging today about the black box being damaged makes it seem like the possibility I predicted five days ago is turning out to be true. Be that as it may, we will not rest until we get answers whether it was an accident or a murder in the case of Dada!” he said.","Ajit Pawar and four others were killed on the morning of January 28 when the aircraft carrying them crashed while attempting to land at the Baramati airport in Pune district.

NEW DELHI: With Kerala heading towards Assembly elections, the ruling Left government on Tuesday refrained from spelling out its stand on the entry of women of menstruating age into the Sabarimala Temple , saying it would decide after consultations and when the Supreme Court seeks its response.Facing sustained pressure from the opposition, states law minister P Rajeev and Devaswom minister V N Vasavan said the apex court had only constituted a larger bench to examine review pleas and had not yet asked the state government to clarify its position.“We have always been with the devotees. There is no doubt about it. We will never stand against devotees,” Vasavan told reporters, but avoided directly answering whether the government would support or oppose women’s entry, reported PTI.He said arguments in the matter would begin in April and that the government would inform the court of its stand after necessary consultations.Rajeev echoed the position, noting that the court would first examine whether it had the authority to intervene in traditional ritualistic practices at places of worship. “So, it is illogical to ask the government to announce its stand at this juncture,” he said, according to PTI.The minister added that the SC had indicated it would consider review pleas only after addressing seven fundamental questions, giving the government time to consult constitutional experts and scholars before taking a decision.The issue has resurfaced as a political flashpoint in poll-bound Kerala, with the Congress and BJP demanding clarity from the CPI(M)-led government, which had earlier backed the implementation of the 2018 verdict allowing women of all ages to enter the shrine – a move that had sparked widespread protests across the state.CPI(M) general secretary M A Baby also avoided a categorical reply. He said that if the government wished to clarify its stand, it would hold discussions and take an appropriate decision. Referring to the earlier unrest, he said any decision must be taken after due deliberations and that no steps should lead to avoidable social tensions.The controversy regained momentum after the Supreme Court on Monday reopened the matter, announcing that a nine-judge bench would begin final hearings on petitions relating to discrimination against women in religions and places of worship, including Sabarimala.Under pressure from Hindu caste organisations and opposition parties, the Pinarayi Vijayan-led government has maintained that the issue involves constitutional complexities and that it would adopt an appropriate stand after discussions. The opposition has urged the government to file a revised affidavit in the apex court clarifying its position.",Kerala's ruling Left government refrained from spelling out its stand on the entry of women of menstruating age into the Sabarimala Temple.

Delhi University bans on-campus protest for a month after backlash over UCG equity guidelines,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-university-bans-on-campus-protest-for-a-month-after-backlash-over-ucg-equity-guidelines/articleshow/128460256.cms,"UGC Equity Regulations Explained: What Exists What Changed And Why It Has Sparked Protests

NEW DELHI: Delhi University on Tuesday prohibited meetings, processions and protests on its campuses for one month, citing law and order concerns days after clashes erupted over the new equity guidelines issued by the University Grants Commission.The order was issued by the DU proctor following a face-off between student groups during a protest demanding implementation of the UGC’s equity regulations, which have been stayed by the Supreme Court.“This order is issued in view of information received indicating that unrestricted public gatherings, processions, or demonstrations on campus may lead to obstruction of traffic, threats to human life, and disturbance of public peace. In the past, organisers have often failed to control such protests, which have escalated and spread widely, resulting in deterioration of law and order within the University campuses,” the notification stated.The order prohibits holding any public meeting, rally, dharna, protest or agitation; assembly of five or more persons; carrying hazardous materials such as mashals, beacons or torches; shouting slogans or making speeches; and engaging in activities that may disturb public tranquillity or traffic flow.The move follows tensions on Friday when rival student groups accused each other of violence and intimidation during a pro-UGC equity guidelines protest. According to the Left-backed student union AISA, some students were allegedly threatened and subjected to casteist abuse by members of a rival group, reported ANI.Countering the claims, ABVP alleged that a female journalist associated with a YouTube channel was assaulted by Left-backed activists. The journalist claimed she was targeted by a mob, as reported by ANI. “The entire crowd came towards me and attacked me. This is clear in the video. About 500 people attacked me. They only have fabricated narratives and allegations. The girls around me whispered rape threats in my ears just because I am a Brahmin; ‘aaj tu chal, tera nanga parade niklega,’ is what they said. ”Earlier, DU vice chancellor Yogesh Singh appealed for calm. “I request all teachers and students of Delhi University to maintain harmony among themselves. Do not engage in any activity that increases mutual discord and harms the image of the nation and the university. The incident at Delhi University yesterday is a cause for concern. Students from all states in India and from all communities study at the university. Social harmony is the greatest thing, and maintaining it is the duty of all of us,” he said in a statement shared on the university’s X handle.On January 29, the Supreme Court stayed the UGC (Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions) Regulations, 2026, observing that there was “complete vagueness” in Regulation 3(C), which defines caste-based discrimination, and that it could be misused. “The language needs to be re-modified,” the court said, adding that the 2012 UGC regulations would continue to apply for now.The new regulations were introduced to curb caste-based discrimination and require higher education institutions to set up special committees and helplines to address complaints from students belonging to Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe and Other Backward Classes categories.",The order was issued by the DU proctor following a face-off between student groups during a protest demanding implementation of the UGC’s equity regulations.

Why Congress finally drew the line

Spin doctor without a party

NEW DELHI: When veteran leader Mani Shankar Aiyar declared that he was a ""Gandhian, Nehruvian, Rajivian but not a Rahulian,"" it sounded, at first glance, like another bout of his familiar provocation. But the remark, delivered amid the Congress 's attempt to present discipline and unity ahead of key assembly elections, quickly raises larger debate about the ideology, authority and dissent inside the grand old party.The Congress moved swiftly to distance itself from Aiyar's remarks and said the leader had no association with the party. But was Aiyar merely indulging his taste for rhetorical rebellion, or was he pointing to something real about how Congress has changed in ""under"" Rahul Gandhi Political analyst and Congress chronicler Rasheed Kidwai believes Aiyar's claim contains ""a grain of truth,"" but not in the way the former minister imagines.""What Mani Shankar Aiyar is saying has a grain of truth because Congress has moved from a Nehruvian way of looking at things or so to say the Nehruvian ideology to a civil society,"" Kidwai explains.According to him, this shift has not happened overnight. The Congress, he argues, has travelled through three distinct ideological phases.""What used to be the Nehruvian thinking ... the Congress moved from Nehruvian to economic reforms and from economic reforms, which was there during Narsimha Rao and Manmohan Singh Rao, now it has moved to more of a civil society thinking,"" he says.This transition, Kidwai argues, helps explain why Aiyar's attack on ""Rahulian"" politics resonates in some quarters. The Congress ""under"" Rahul Gandhi does not function within a rigid ideological framework in the classical sense.""So what you see around Rahul Gandhi is people who come from civil society and they are influencing him. So civil society does not have a dogmatic kind of ideology,"" Kidwai says.This absence of dogma, he suggests, has consequences for how the party responds politically. Unlike the Nehruvian era, where ideology shaped policy, or the reform years, where economic pragmatism dominated, today's Congress often appears reactive and issue-driven rather than programmatic.Kidwai has written earlier about what he describes as a growing ""civil society"" imprint within the Congress, particularly around Rahul Gandhi. This school of thought, he argues, privileges moral argument, decentralised activism and individual agency over state-led or party-led political action.This orientation, which gained visibility during the Sonia Gandhi-led UPA years through bodies like the National Advisory Council, has now ""almost taken over the party organisation under Rahul Gandhi,"" Kidwai has written.Civil society protagonists, often associated with the so-called ""Jai Jagat"" group, are said to enjoy proximity to Rahul Gandhi and occupy influential organisational roles. Their emphasis on plain living, minimalism and symbolic politics has become part of the Congress's contemporary aesthetic.Yet, as Kidwai notes in his earlier writing, this culture sits uneasily with traditional Congress leaders who rose through the ranks and understand politics as negotiation, organisation and power management rather than moral signalling.While Aiyar positions himself as a custodian of Congress ideology, Kidwai is blunt about his standing within the party.""Mani Shankar Aiyar thinks he represents the Congress ideology, whether it is panchayati or foreign policy or socialism with a leaning towards the poor ... that is not fine. So there are no takers for Mr. Aiyar,"" Kidwai says.""Mr. Aiyar is totally isolated. There is no group, there is no leader in Tamil Nadu or outside who would be subscribing to Mr. Mani Shankar Aiyar,"" he adds.Kidwai contrasts Aiyar's isolation with other Congress leaders who have disagreed with Rahul Gandhi but retain organisational traction.""Shashi Tharoor and many others still have some traction in the Congress ... Manish Tiwari and many others. But there is nobody who would support Mani Shankar Aiyar,"" he says.Aiyar's paradox, Kidwai argues, lies in his political identity. ""Mani Shankar Aiyar's claim to fame was his loyalty towards Rajiv Gandhi,"" he says.""Now there is a bit of a paradox that he is confronting Rajiv Gandhi's son,"" Kidwai adds.That contradiction goes to the heart of Aiyar's frustration.Aiyar once again claimed that the Congress of the past tolerated rebels while today's leadership punishes them. But is it true?""In most political parties, when adversity strikes them, they split,"" he says, recalling the Congress splits after 1967, 1969, 1977 and the fragmentation of the party during and after the Narasimha Rao years.What makes the post-2014 period unusual, Kidwai argues, is not intolerance but endurance.""What happened in 2014 to 2024, and now it's 2026, is very unique, because there's been a long spell of adversity, but no split. 150 leaders have left, but there's been no split in the Congress,"" he says.The result is a party carrying multiple generations of leadership baggage.""Rahul Gandhi does not have a clean slate. He has three, four uncles watching over him,"" Kidwai says. ""Mani Shankar Aiyar is one uncle who says - you are not doing things right.""Aiyar's anger is deeply personal.""He felt that during Rajiv Gandhi's time, he was at 'arsh', which means the cloud line. And he's come to 'farsh' (ground),"" he says.Aiyar, he adds, has not reconciled himself to his diminished access to the Gandhi family. ""He's very hurt and angry about this whole thing,"" Kidwai says.Aiyar has repetedly left the Congress red faced with his remarks like ""chaiwala"" and ""neech aadmi"". The recent outburst had nothing new. So did Congress act now after all these years, clearly stating he has no association with the party?Kidwai attributes this to shifting internal equations.""There was a perception that Mr. Sam Pitroda and Mr. Mani Shankar Aiyar are close to the family,"" he says. That perceived proximity once acted as insulation.But that cover, Kidwai argues, has vanished. ""Now people know that he does not have a backing of the family. So Mr. Aiyar had a false kind of cover ... now that stands exposed,"" he says.By contrast, Kidwai notes, Pitroda remains protected. ""Mr. Sam Pitroda is still in good books of Rahul Gandhi, so nobody says a thing about him,"" he says, even though both men, in Kidwai's says, are ""motor mouths"" whose remarks have often ""hurt the political interests of the Congress.""Kidwai traces Aiyar's instinct for provocation to his past.""Before social media and the internet boom, Mr. Mani Shankar Aiyar was an original spin doctor,"" he says, recalling Aiyar's diplomatic career and his role as a key Rajiv Gandhi aide.That instinct, Kidwai argues, remains intact, but now operates without institutional relevance.""He's trying to seek attention of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul and Priyanka ... and he's not getting it,"" Kidwai says.Aiyar's use of the term ""Rahulian,"" Kidwai believes, is part of this attention-seeking strategy rather than a serious ideological intervention.""He has that ability to give a spin, and that is what he's doing,"" Kidwai says.But is there any truth in Aiyar's warning?While dismissive of Aiyar's influence, Kidwai does not entirely reject his diagnosis.""There is a discomfort, which is not evident,"" he says, referring to unease within the Congress over Rahul Gandhi's reliance on civil society inputs rather than organisational consensus.He points to campaign slogans and movements like ""chowkidar chor hai"" and ""vote chori"" as examples of strategies that did not emerge from internal party deliberation.""None of these things have come from the Congress organisation,"" Kidwai says.Yet, unlike Shashi Tharoor, who secured 11–12 percent of votes in the 2023 Congress presidential election, Aiyar commands no following.""Mani Shankar Aiyar will get zero,"" Kidwai says bluntly.For now, Aiyar has coined new term ""Rahulian"" which the Congress's opponents may try to stick to public memory. Its originator, however, may fade further into irrelevance.Aiyar may have named something real, an ideological shift from structured doctrine to civil society politics. But in doing so, Kidwai argues, he has personalised a transformation that is larger than Rahul Gandhi and older than Aiyar's own grievances.In the end, Aiyar's rebellion may say less about the Congress's future than about one veteran's inability to accept that the party he once shaped has moved on without him.","Former minister Mani Shankar Aiyar said he was a ""Gandhian, Nehruvian, Rajivian but not a Rahulian"" The remark raised larger debate about the ideology, authority and dissent inside the grand old party. Political analyst and Congress chronicler Rasheed Kidwai believes Aiyer's claim contains ""a grain of truth"" Kid wai argues Congress has travelled through three distinct ideological phases.

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Tuesday said his government has decided to make a reservation of 3 per cent for tea tribes and Adivasi people in the Grade I & II jobs in the poll-bound state.The Assam CM had announced a 3 per cent reservation for youths from tea gardens in Grade I and Grade II government jobs in October last year during the 19th biennial general conference of the Assam Tea Tribe Students’ Association (ATTSA) and the central biennial general conference of the Assam Tea Tribe Women’s Association.The event was held at Mariani College playground in Jorhat district.""If we cannot bring the 40 lakh people of the tea community into the mainstream of society, Assam as a whole will never progress. Therefore, we are continuously working towards this goal,” Assam CM had said.As part of this effort, the government will now extend 3 per cent reservation to tea garden youths in Class I and II jobs, including the Assam Civil Service (ACS) and Assam Police Service (APS).The state government has already initiated a 3 per cent reservation for tea and Adivasi communities under the OBC quota in Grade III and IV government jobs.CM Himanta also said the state Cabinet approved Rs 335 crore to establish the second Sainik School of Assam at Langvoku area in Karbi Anglong.As the northeastern state gears up for the big battle for the new legislative, the Assam CM said he would be visiting the house of disgruntled Congress leader Bhupen Kumar Borah, who resigned as Assam unit chief on Monday.""I will visit Bhupen Kumar Borah's residence between 6:30 pm and 7 pm today. I already talked with him over the telephone,"" CM Himanta said.The BJP leader on Monday had also invited Borah to join the ruling party, hours after he submitted his resignation from the Congress, triggering political upheaval in the poll-bound state.Sarma said the BJP’s doors were open for Borah and promised to help him get elected from a “safe seat” if he joined. He also announced that he would visit Borah’s residence to discuss his future plans.“If he wants to join the BJP, we will welcome him, but even if he does not want to do so, we extend our best wishes to him,” Sarma told reporters.Sarma described Borah as the “last Hindu leader” in the Congress without a family background holding ministerial or legislative posts and said his resignation sent a larger message about internal democracy in the party.Meanwhile, recognised national and state political parties of Assam, during their meetings with the election commission on Tuesday, asked for holding the assembly polls in either a single or a maximum of two phases in Assam, officials told news agency PTI.The full bench of the poll body, led by Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar, is on a visit to Assam to review preparedness for the forthcoming assembly elections in the state.","Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma announces 3 per cent reservation for tea tribes and Adivasi people in Grade I & II jobs in the poll-bound state.

“Congress Failed The Northeast” PM Modi Slams Congress Over Assam’s Growth

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has alleged that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi was responsible for blocking his elevation to the chief minister’s post when the party was in power in the state.Sarma claimed that in 2014, then Congress president Sonia Gandhi had asked him to decide the date for his swearing-in. According to him, the move was later stalled due to Rahul Gandhi’s intervention.""Madam (Sonia Gandhi), whom I still refer to as such, had asked me to decide on the date and I had told her that I would take oath after the Ambubachi Mela at Kamakhya Temple in June (2014),"" news agency PTI quoted Sarma as saying.""I was hurt then, but now I believe that whatever happens in one's life is for the best and God has given me much more than what I would have got, had I remained in the Congress. As the BJP CM, I got a chance to serve both Assam and Sanatan dharma wholeheartedly, which would not have been possible had I been in the Congress,"" he added.In 2014, the state was led by senior Congress leader Tarun Gogoi , who was serving his third straight term as chief minister. Sarma, then seen as one of Gogoi’s closest associates, spearheaded a major internal challenge, citing dissatisfaction with Gogoi’s leadership and calling for generational change within the party. He had claimed the support of a majority of Congress MLAs during that episode.The Congress high command chose to stick with Gogoi, after which Sarma resigned from the state cabinet in July 2014.He quit the Congress altogether in 2015 and joined the BJP.Assam is set to go to the polls for its 126 assembly seats in March–April, with the Congress likely to contest as part of a broader opposition alliance.At present, the BJP has 64 MLAs in the assembly, while its allies — AGP, UPPL and BPF — hold nine, seven and three seats respectively. In the opposition ranks, Congress has 26 members, AIUDF 15 and CPI(M) one, along with one Independent legislator.","Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has alleged that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi was responsible for blocking his elevation.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Police has filed an FIR against the father of a 17-year-old boy for allegedly allowing him to illegally drive his SUV. The boy was at the wheel of the vehicle when it collided with a motorcycle and a cab, resulting in the death of the biker, 23-year-old Sahil Dhaneshra, in Sector 11 of Dwarka on Feb 3.Sahil sustained severe brain injuries and multiple fractures, according to his postmortem report.Police have seized the SUV and invoked against the father provisions under Section 199A of Motor Vehicles Act, which hold guardians or vehicle owners accountable when a minor commits a traffic offence. Penalties under this section include imprisonment of up to three years, a fine of Rs 25,000 and cancellation of the vehicle's registration for a year. The father was bound down and will be formally chargesheeted, Ankit Singh, deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka), said.Cops, who had been alerted about the accident at 11.57 am, found the motorcycle, the SUV and the cab in severely damaged condition. Sahil was declared dead on the spot, while Ajit Singh, the cab driver, sustained injuries.""Preliminary investigations indicate that the motorcycle and SUV collided head on.Following the impact, the SUV lost control and crashed into the cab parked along the roadside,"" a police officer said.Just after the accident, the SUV driver claimed he was 19 years old, the officer said. However, police later found out that he was 17, and was produced before the Juvenile Justice Board and sent to an observation home. He was granted interim bail on Feb 10 so that he could write his Class X examinations.Sahil's mother alleged that the SUV had 12 challans pertaining to overspeeding against it. Police are trying to corroborate the claim from the Centre's ‘parivahan' portal. They are also studying a purported video of the collision circulating online to establish the sequence of events.According to Sahil's postmortem report, he suffered a fracture in the left temporo-parietal bone in the skull and had a generalised brain oedema. Blood clots were found in his oral cavity and multiple ribs on the left side of his chest were fractured.Explaining the nature of Sahil's injuries, a doctor said that the severe head injuries caused heavy bleeding and swelling inside his brain, particularly on the left side. Blood had collected between the brain and its outer covering. The entire brain was swollen because of bleeding and bruising.","Delhi Police has filed an FIR against the father of a 17-year-old boy for allegedly allowing him to illegally drive his SUV.

Pawtucket Police Chief Tina Goncalves identifies Robert Dorgan in targeted Rhode Island hockey arena shooting

Robert Dorgan was a 56-year-old transgender person from Rhode Island who was also known as Roberta Esposito. Police claims he was the suspect in a deadly shooting during a high school hockey game in Pawtucket. The incident happened at Dennis M. Lynch Arena and left three people dead, including Dorgan. Three others were hurt and are in critical condition. According to Pawtucket Police Chief Tina Goncalves, Dorgan died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

We extend our deepest sympathies to the victims, their families and all those affected by this tragedy. Any further questions should be directed to law enforcement.”Police publicly identified Robert Dorgan during a Monday night press conference. Chief Tina Goncalves said the shooting took place during a youth hockey game that involved cooperative high school teams.

Government rejects charges





Pakistan's former Prime Minister Imran Khan 's family has claimed that he is enduring ""unimaginable mistreatment"" in prison and demanded better health facilities for him.This comes after Khan recently told a visiting lawyer that he lost about 85 per cent of vision in the right eye due to alleged lack of health services.Khan's sister Noreen Niazi claimed that the former prime minister is under the directives of 'Asim Law' and facing irreversible damage to his right eye as a direct consequence. She claimed that Khan has been diagnosed with retinal vein occlusion.""Imran Khan, a global celebrity, a philanthropist, and former prime minister of Pakistan, has endured unimaginable mistreatment in prison under the directives of 'Asim Law,' now facing irreversible damage to his right eye as a direct consequence,"" Khan's sister Noreen Niazi said in a post on X, referring to Chief of Defence Forces Field Marshal Asim Munir.""The jail’s poor conditions have severely impacted his health, leading to devastating effects on his eye, now diagnosed as retinal vein occlusion. This isn’t mere negligence. It’s deliberate cruelty, executed through an evil and conniving master plan of Gen Asim Munir. Under the vengeful instructions of Asim Munir, Imran Khan’s due treatment is being handled inside the poor conditions of the jail,"" she added.Noreen added that given the nature of Khan's eye condition, where he’s already lost 85 per cent of his vision, proper treatment ""simply isn’t possible in a prison setting"".""Our sole constitutional and legal demand is that Imran Khan be immediately transferred to Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad for treatment under the supervision of his personal physicians,"" she demanded.""You (Munir) declare yourself the chief of a Muslim armed forces, quoting Quranic verses in your speech, but you refuse to abide by them. The nation is wide awake, and the whole world is watching this brutality and inhumane and despicable treatment of Imran Khan. This ushers in concerns about Imran Khan’s legal rights; it rather underscores the gravity of lawlessness now prevalent in Pakistan under illegitimate and un-Islamic rule. It represents a profound trial of your beliefs, your command, and your impending judgment,"" Noreen said.Meanwhile, Khan's close aide Zulfi Bokhari said the former premier told his wife Bushra Bibi on Tuesday that he remains deeply concerned about his eye.""His first and only priority is an immediate emergency meeting with his personal physicians -Dr Faisal Sultan and Dr Asim. Let’s put politics aside for a moment and only focus on this one, extremely reasonable demand,"" Bokhari said.Meanwhile, Pakistan's opposition alliance continued its sit-in in Islamabad, demanding better health facilities for jailed former premier Imran Khan.The sit-in is led by the Tehreek-e-Tahaffuz-e-Ain Pakistan (TTAP), an alliance set up last year to protest the constitution of the country.Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) is its main force, while the alliance is led by Mahmood Khan Achakzai, a Pashtun tribal leader from Balochistan who is also the leader of the opposition in the national assembly.The group launched the protest on Friday at two places in Islamabad, including near the parliament building and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House, the official building of the provincial government in the capital.The protestors have vowed to continue the sit-ins until Khan is shifted for specialist care to a private hospital.The PTI has cut off Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province from the rest of the country by road blockades, demanding that Khan be immediately shifted to the hospital and allowing his doctors to see him.More than a dozen former international cricket captains also issued a statement appealing the Islamabad government to give him ""adequate"" medical treatment.Former cricket skippers ""respectfully"" urges Pakistan ""to ensure that Imran Khan receives immediate, adequate and ongoing medical attention from qualified specialists of his choosing"".The campaign is led by former Australian captain and contemporary of Khan, Greg Chappell.""Khan deserves fair and transparent access to legal processes without undue delay or hindrance,"" the statement said.Other signatories are Michael Atherton, Michael Brearley, Nasser Hussain and David Gower (England), Allan Border, Ian Chappell, Belinda Clark, Steve Waugh and Kim Hughes (Australia), Clive Lloyd (West Indies) and John Wright (New Zealand).Interior minister Mohsin Naqvi told the media that the government has no intention to “politicise” the matter of Khan’s health, while blaming the opposition for doing the same.“The medical report also came forward yesterday, and everything is clear as per it. Neither we nor the government want to politicise this,” he said.He also criticised the furore by the PTI over Khan's health.“Putting up such a show is extremely inappropriate, especially misleading people,” the minister said.The government refuted the charges made by Khan's family and said that a two-member team of doctor, who, after examining the former premier concluded that his vision in the right eye without glasses was recorded at 6/24 partial, while the left eye measured 6/9.However, with corrective glasses, the right eye improved to 6/9 partial and the left eye to 6/6.They also reported a reduction in the swelling in the right eye, with its thickness decreasing from 550 to 350 microns, and the report termed it a sign of improvement. The doctors also recommended eye drops for both eyes, while advising the PTI founder to undergo two other eye tests.Pakistan's Supreme Court has already requested a report on Khan's living conditions in the Adiala jail near Rawalpindi, in connection with a case that has been pending since 2023.Authorities had previously confirmed that Khan underwent a 20-minute medical procedure in January at Islamabad's government hospital but gave no other details.","Khan's sister Noreen Niazi claimed that the former prime minister is under the directives of 'Asim Law' She claimed that Khan has been diagnosed with retinal vein occlusion.

Candace Drops 'SECRET' TPUSA Tape: Erika Kirk Heard Laughing Days After Charlie Kirk’s Killing

Laura Loomer backs Erika Kirk as feud with Candace Owens intensifies





Conservative media circles were jolted on Valentine’s Day after activist Laura Loomer publicly voiced support for Erika Kirk while escalating her ongoing feud with commentator Candace Owens. The tweet consisted of sympathy, praise and sharp criticism that fueled an argument that has been simmering through podcasts, social media discussion forums, and political commentary platforms.The conflict arises amid prolonged investigation of Erika Kirk after the demise of her husband, Charlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA. Owens has repeatedly questioned details surrounding the couple’s marriage and events before his death, prompting backlash from Loomer and others who view the commentary as invasive and harmful. Loomer’s latest post framed the controversy as a targeted smear campaign rather than legitimate inquiry.“Happy Valentine’s Day to @MrsErikaKirk,” Laura Loomer wrote on X. “Just know that not all of us are sociopathic lying a***oles and many of us stand with you, we support you, and we are rooting for your success despite the deliberate effort to smear you by jealous and spiteful women online who wish they had what you had and wish they looked like you,” she added.The message did not mention Owens by name, but its target was widely understood. Loomer has previously urged Erika Kirk to pursue legal action, describing Owens’ commentary as defamatory and “beyond depraved.” In earlier posts, she called for a restraining order and accused Owens of promoting damaging claims.Owens, for her part, has scrutinized Erika’s interview remarks about sending Charlie Kirk to sleep in their daughter’s room before an event and questioned why he was not wearing his wedding ring that night. She has presented these facts as peculiar and this has caused skepticism among her audience that has attracted both appreciation and disapproval.This conflict has become a larger spectacle of the media, the result of rifts at the heart of conservative circles of commentators. The fans of both parties still debate on the internet, transforming individual sorrow, allegiance, and mass media investigations into a political and cultural hotspot.In the case of Erika Kirk, the newfound interest makes sure that the personal tragedy never ceases to be mixed up in the politics of polemic. Loomer and Owens are still in a battle that does not seem to come to an end.","Laura Loomer publicly defended Erika Kirk in a Valentine’s Day post while sharply criticizing Candace Owens, escalating an ongoing conservative media feud.

Dana White, Hunter Campbell and Sean O’Malley speak as court examines UFC evidence practices

UFC president Dana White and executive Hunter Campbell are facing fresh legal attention as a federal court reviews whether key electronic evidence was not properly saved in an ongoing antitrust lawsuit. During a recent hearing presided by Judge Richard Boulware, the court investigated claims that the UFC might have failed to preserve important communication records.This type of hearing, known as a spoliation hearing, focuses on whether missing evidence happened by mistake or on purpose. If the judge believes there was intent, the UFC could face serious penalties under federal rules.The situation has quickly become a major talking point in the MMA world. White appeared in court and answered questions directly, but some of his statements raised eyebrows. Meanwhile, discussions on UFC commercial methods have persisted, particularly after fans and athletes responded to allegations regarding who really negotiates contracts. With the legal process still ongoing, the court’s decisions could play a big role in how the case moves forward.During the hearing, Dana White made several statements that drew attention.He said he uses a flip phone, does not use email or a computer, and does not personally handle most fighter negotiations.According to White, those responsibilities have been managed by UFC Chief Business Officer Hunter Campbell and other executives since 2017.Critics questioned these explanations, arguing they could influence how the court views missing communication records.Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(e), Judge Richard Boulware has the power to issue sanctions if the court finds that evidence was intentionally not preserved.Legal commentators have noted that proving intent is rare, but the judge still has broad authority to decide how missing information impacts the case.The ruling could affect how a jury views the UFC during trial or how certain evidence is used moving forward. Amid the public debate, several fighters supported White’s claims.Former bantamweight champion Sean O’Malley said on his podcast, “Yeah, I mean, I’ve never dealt with Dana ever dealing with fights… Hunter’s always done that.”Veteran fighter Matt Brown shared a similar view, saying he has mainly dealt with other UFC officials since the company was sold in 2017.As the legal battle continues, the court now holds the next big decision. The focus remains on whether the UFC’s actions were simple mistakes or something more serious. For now, the MMA world is closely watching what comes next.","A federal court is investigating claims that the UFC failed to preserve important communication records.

Police Register Two FIRs, Invoke Assault Charges

(With agency inputs)





NEW DELHI: A woman YouTuber alleged on Saturday that she was assaulted and that an attempt was made to forcibly take her away during a protest at Delhi University’s North Campus a day earlier. However, a student group denied the allegations, claiming that its members were targeted instead.The YouTuber stated that she had gone to cover a protest demanding the implementation of new UGC regulations and was attacked after being asked her name.""I had gone to cover the protest, as I regularly do. Before I could even take out my mic, a person behind me tried to instigate me by repeatedly taking my name. When I asked him what the issue was, he asked for my name and caste. I told him my name and asked what had happened. After that, things escalated,"" the YouTuber said.""The entire crowd came towards me and attacked me. This is clear in the video. About 500 people attacked me. They just have fake narrations and fake allegations. The girls around me whispered rape threats in my ears just because I am a Brahmin; ""aaj tu chal, tera nanga parade niklega,"" is what they said. The men around me were saying that they would teach me a lesson.The girls had held me by the arms and neck. This is an attempt to murder. I had fallen unconscious, but the Police did nothing, "" she told ANI.YouTuber alleged that the reason the mob targeted her for her caste and that she was now registered an FIR in the case.""A boy there was signalling to others to take me away. Did they want to kidnap me? My clothes were being torn. I was being improperly touched. They were goons, they cannot be students. I was attacked due to my caste. Nobody supported me, only a few Law Faculties showed humanity, and I came out with their help as well as with that of a few women Police personnel. FIR has been registered, I trust the law .The incident occurred for about half an hour. There was mob lynching there, I escaped somehow is a big deal for me."" she claimed.""There was also a car with its gate open, and gestures were being made suggesting I be taken inside. I have filed a complaint with the police,"" she added.Meanwhile, Delhi University vice-chancellor Yogesh Singh described the incident as a matter of concern and said maintaining social harmony was everyone’s responsibility.The All India Students' Association (AISA) said in a statement that the protest over the UGC regulations was peaceful and that its activists intervened after the YouTuber allegedly created a disruption and confronted a journalist at the site.It termed the allegations ""false and motivated"" and said two of its members were later threatened and faced abuse at the police station when they went to file a complaint.The student outfit also claimed that videos circulating online do not show the full sequence of events. Multiple videos of the incident have been shared on social media with each side claiming that the onus lies with the other side.Delhi Police said two FIRs have been registered based on complaints filed by the YouTuber and a woman student affiliated with AISA.The Delhi University VC posted on X, requesting all teachers and students to maintain harmony among themselves. ""Do not engage in any activity that increases mutual discord and harms the image of the nation and the university,"" he said.Singh said students from all states of India and all communities study in the university. ""Social harmony is the greatest thing, and maintaining it is the duty of all of us,"" he wrote on X.""I have spoken with several student groups and teacher groups today and have also spoken with the police administration to ensure that no such incident occurs in the future that harms harmony. The new rules of the UGC that have come are currently under consideration in the Hon'ble Supreme Court.""I appeal to all teachers and students of the university to maintain their trust in the Government of India and await the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court,"" the VC said.Chaos marked a protest called by Left-backed student unions at Delhi University on Friday evening. The unrest followed a separate protest organised by the All India Forum for Equity to observe ‘All India Vanchit Adhikar Divas’ at the Arts Faculty, which allegedly witnessed scenes of violence. The students were demanding that the University Grants Commission (UGC) Regulations address and eliminate caste discrimination on campuses across India.A face-off between two student groups triggered claims and counter-claims, with each side accusing the other of violence and intimidation. According to the Left-backed student union AISA, some students were allegedly threatened and subjected to casteist abuse and slurs by a rival group.AISA activists further claimed that when they went to a local police station to register an FIR against the alleged attackers, members of the rival group ABVP — affiliated with the BJP — attacked them.In its statement the AISA said, ""Delhi Police repeatedly failed to disperse the attacking mob and even if they moved away this mob kept coming back. While the lawyer of the students inside was not allowed to enter the police station, the people against whom the complaint was being made entered and with them some goons even entered the station.""""The mob at this time became even more agitated and tried to surround those who had come in solidarity against the mob attack in order to attack them. Instead of removing the violent crowd, the police stood by and watched as the mob raised slogans like ""Desh ke gaddaron ko, goli maro salon ko"" (Shoot the traitors of the country), ""Brahmanwad Zindabad"" (Long live Brahmanism) and other violent gestures aimed particularly women comrades,"" AISA alleged in its statement.Countering these allegations, ABVP alleged that a female journalist, associated with a YouTube channel was allegedly assaulted by Left backed student activists. ABVP said that the incident exposes the violent character of Left-affiliated student organisations, which otherwise claim to champion freedom of expression across universities in the country.Meanwhile, a senior police officer said that FIRs have been filed in the case, and they have begun an inquiry.""Two FIRs have been registered, including one where the complainant is a female YouTuber and another, a female student from AISA. Both the FIRs have been registered under Sections 74 (assault or criminal force against a woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 115(2) (voluntarily causing hurt), 126(2) (wrongful restraint) and 3(5) (common intention) of the BNS.

DEHRADUN: In a major breakthrough in the probe into the daylight murder of 54-year-old Jharkhand gangster Vikram Sharma in Dehradun on Friday morning, Uttarakhand police on Saturday claimed to have unravelled the conspiracy and identified all three assailants.A senior officer at the police headquarters (PHQ), monitoring the investigation, told TOI that Sharma was ""killed on the directions of gangster Akhilesh Singh"", who is currently lodged in Dumka Central Jail in Jharkhand. Sharma had allegedly mentored Singh in the past, helping him establish himself in the criminal network.""It emerged during the probe that there was a dispute between the two over the sharing of extortion money.

He was shot dead by three unidentified assailants on Friday morning after stepping out of the gym.The officer said police have identified all three accused and traced the route they took to flee the scene. ""After escaping on a motorbike, they reached Haridwar and stayed in a hotel for a few hours before boarding a train to leave the state. They have been identified and will be arrested soon. The investigation also revealed that Sharma was shot in the head from behind at point-blank range, indicating the attackers were professional and intended to leave no chance of survival,"" he added.When contacted, Uttarakhand DGP Deepam Seth declined to share further details, citing the ongoing investigation. ""However, we can confirm that the motive behind the murder has been established and the shooters, who are from Jharkhand, have been identified.

The couple had been married for barely five months.On Valentine’s Day (February 14), the couple visited Hisar and stayed with family.The next evening, around 7 pm on February 15, they left Mahak’s parental home in Hansi for Gurugram. About four hours later, Anshul called the police, claiming unidentified attackers had intercepted their car near Pahsaur village in the Badli area of Jhajjar district, killed his wife, and fled.Police found Mahak’s body lying outside the car on a dirt track about 100 metres off the Jhajjar-Badli road. Her throat had been slit.However, Anshul’s version soon fell apart during questioning. He failed to describe the alleged attackers and repeatedly changed his statement.During sustained interrogation and a crime scene reconstruction, Anshul confessed. Police said the couple frequently argued over his suspicions about Mahak’s character. The dispute escalated during the drive, leading him to first strangle her and then slit her throat with a pair of scissors, allegedly while wearing gloves to avoid leaving evidence. He later staged the scene to resemble a robbery.Mahak’s father, Krishna Kathuria, had expressed suspicion against his son-in-law from the outset. Family members also stated that Mahak was pregnant at the time of her death.Police have arrested the accused and are proceeding with further investigation.","The victim, Mahak, worked with HDFC Bank in Gurgaon.

Watch: Video shows massive avalanche racing toward group of skiers in Italy; 2 killed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/watch-video-shows-massive-avalanche-racing-toward-group-of-skiers-in-italy-2-killed/articleshow/128491998.cms,"



Two off-piste skiers were killed and a third seriously injured when an avalanche struck a mountainside near Courmayeur on Sunday morning, Italy’s central Alpine Rescue service (CNSAS) said.The avalanche hit the Canale dei Vesses, also known as the Couloir Vesses, a steep and well-known freeride route in the upper Val Veny area at the foot of the Mont Blanc massif, near the French-Swiss border.A video circulating online shows the moment the avalanche struck the resort, with skiers seen being caught in the rushing snow.At least three skiers were caught in the slide on the Italian side of Mont Blanc, west of the town of Courmayeur, which has about 2,900 residents and lies roughly 200 kilometres northwest of Milan. Courmayeur is also near Milan, one of the venues set to host events during the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics and is a well-known base for winter sports, as per AP reports.According to CNSAS, the victims were a woman and two men who were “probably” French nationals. One skier died at the scene, while another was transported to the hospital in serious condition but later succumbed to injuries.The third skier was taken to a hospital in Turin and remains in serious condition.A search-and-rescue operation involving 15 rescuers, three canine units and two helicopters was launched shortly after the avalanche. Rescue teams located and recovered the victims from the steep off-trail slope, which is popular among experienced backcountry skiers.The incident comes amid heightened avalanche risk across the Alpine region.Alpine rescue has warned that fresh snowfall from recent storms, combined with wind-blown snow accumulating over weak underlying layers, has created particularly unstable conditions along the Alpine crescent bordering France, Switzerland and Austria.In a separate incident on Sunday, another person was partially buried by an avalanche in the Trentino region but was rescued by companions.The latest tragedy follows a record week in the Italian mountains, where 13 backcountry skiers, climbers and hikers died in the week ending Feb 8, including 10 in avalanches linked to an exceptionally unstable snowpack.","A woman and two men were killed when an avalanche struck a mountainside near Courmayeur on Sunday morning.

'Threw red chutney into eyes': 21-year-old woman abducted in front of family in Pune; massive protests erupt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/threw-red-chutney-into-eyes-21-year-old-woman-abducted-in-front-of-family-in-pune-massive-protests-erupt/articleshow/128491809.cms,"



PUNE: Angry protesters blocked the Pune–Solapur highway at Bhigwan in Indapur taluka, about 100 km from the city, on Tuesday night amid tension over the abduction of a 21-year-old woman earlier that afternoon by three men hailing from a different community.The blockade continued for more than 30 minutes before police managed to convince the protesters to clear the highway.Police said the woman, whose marriage is scheduled for February 22, was returning home after shopping when two of the three men threw chilli powder into the eyes of her mother and brother, who were accompanying her and abducted her between 3.30 pm and 4 pm. The third person stood nearby.The suspects reside in the same neighbourhood as the woman’s family and are known to them, police added.Superintendent of Police, Pune Rural, Sandeep Singh Gill, said, “We have identified the three men. Six teams have been formed to trace and rescue the woman and nab the suspects.”Bhigwan police registered a case of abduction late Tuesday night after a sizeable number of irate residents gathered outside the police station, demanding action.On Wednesday, Pune Rural police denied permission to BJP legislator Gopichand Padalkar to address a public rally at Bhigwan, citing the tense situation and the need to avoid any trouble ahead of Shiv Jayanti on February 19.Police said CCTV footage showed the three men walking close to the woman and her two family members in the Bhigwan market area. Two of them then approached the victims and threw chilli powder into the eyes of the woman’s mother and brother before abducting her.Police suspect the trio had parked their vehicles some distance away from the crime scene.Members of various political parties gathered in Bhigwan and demanded strict action against the accused.","Angry protesters blocked the Pune–Solapur highway at Bhigwan in Indapur taluka, about 100 km from the city.

‘Strictly for beautiful Russian girls’? What new files allege about Epstein’s links to Hamptons nightclub promoters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/strictly-for-beautiful-russian-girls-what-new-files-allege-about-epsteins-links-to-hamptons-nightclub-promoters/articleshow/128489436.cms,"(AP)





Newly released Department of Justice files reveal that Jeffrey Epstein used the Hamptons as a primary hub for his ""grooming"" operations. The documents allege that Epstein routinely flew young women to the exclusive enclave for ""girls' weekends,"" using a network of wealthy local contacts and luxury parties to build trust and facilitate exploitation.The documents include emails suggesting Epstein coordinated travel, parties and weekend stays in the Hamptons through well-connected acquaintances. An FBI document from 2020 cited in the files said a tipster claimed Epstein had close ties in the area who would “procure underage girls for him.”Epstein’s Hamptons circle also included Mark Baker, a nightclub owner and promoter in the Hamptons and New York City who appears roughly 50 times in the documents. In a 2010 email introducing Baker to Epstein, a redacted correspondent wrote that Baker wanted Epstein to organize weekly parties in his clubs in New York and the Hamptons “strictly for beautiful Russian girls,” adding, “I think it will be a great way to find new friends. ”Later emails show Baker arranging in-person meetings with Epstein after that introduction. According to his website, Baker now lives in Bali, Indonesia.Some emails directly addressed to Epstein referenced unspecified partying in the Hamptons without indicating illegal conduct.In one May 2016 message that included a photo of girls eating on a sidewalk in Montauk, a redacted sender wrote: “We’ve got for us pink t-shirts and it says on it ‘girls weekend.’ Thank you so much Jeffrey for our happiest time.”The emails also show Epstein coordinating arrangements with Hamptons contacts, including millionaire restaurateur Stephen Hanson. In a 2017 exchange, Hanson agreed to let women — who did not appear to be underage — stay at his Hamptons property for a weekend.Hanson, about 66 at the time and mentioned nearly 3,000 times in the files, is not accused of wrongdoing in the correspondence.Other threads show Hanson discussing making “jerky,” inviting the women to his Hamptons restaurant, and asking Epstein if any of them would join him at an opera after he “blew off” his wife. The files also indicate Hanson had previously visited Little St. James, Epstein’s private island.","Newly released Department of Justice files reveal that Jeffrey Epstein used the Hamptons as a primary hub for his ""grooming"" operations.

US State Department has reiterated that visas are not a guaranteed right and can be taken away if foreign visitors act against America’s national interests, following remarks by secretary of state Marco Rubio during a visit to Hungary.In a video shared by the department, Rubio said he had made the point repeatedly and wanted to make it clear again.“I’ve said this repeatedly.

The department has emphasised that consular officers around the world routinely deny visas for a range of reasons, including concerns over overstaying or criminal behaviour.Rubio has made similar points in the past, telling lawmakers that a visa is a privilege rather than a right and with a hardline ant-immigrant stance saying that there is no constitutional entitlement to one.","US State Department has reiterated that visas are not a guaranteed right and can be taken away if foreign visitors act against America's national interests.

Risk factors across Los Angeles

Burn scar areas — Hillsides affected by wildfire lack vegetation to absorb water, increasing the chance of debris flows and mudslides.

Urban zones — Heavy rain can quickly overwhelm storm drains and cause water to pool on streets and freeways.

Official advice





Los Angeles and much of Southern California are facing flash flood risks as a series of strong storms moves through the region, bringing heavy rain, thunderstorms and hazardous conditions. Officials and forecasters warn residents to stay alert and prepared because flash floods can develop quickly and with little warning.A powerful weather system has brought intense rainfall to Southern California, including Los Angeles County. The National Weather Service (NWS) has issued flash flood warnings and watches for parts of the county as rainstorms dump significant moisture over the area.Heavy rain has already triggered warnings for places including the Santa Monica Mountains and burn scar zones like the Palisades and Franklin areas, where recent wildfires have left the ground more prone to dangerous debris flows and rapid runoff.Forecasters say this weather pattern is part of a larger system that could bring several days of precipitation, with the heaviest rainfall expected early in the week. Coastal and valley regions may see between 1 to 3 inches of rain, while mountain areas could receive between 2 to 5 inches or more.Storms may also be accompanied by strong winds and isolated thunderstorms. In some conditions, even weak tornado activity cannot be ruled out as part of the larger threat.A flash flood warning means flooding is imminent or already happening. Water can rise rapidly along streams, in urban streets, and in poorly drained areas. A flood watch, on the other hand, means conditions are favourable for flooding.Because flash floods can occur within minutes of heavy rain, authorities urge people not to drive through flooded roads and to seek higher ground if necessary.Certain areas are especially vulnerable:Authorities recommend monitoring local weather bulletins, signing up for emergency alerts, and preparing for possible evacuations in vulnerable locations. Roads may become dangerous, and officials warn that flash flooding can strike fast and without much notice.Staying informed through trusted weather services such as the NWS and local emergency management is essential during these conditions.",A powerful weather system has brought intense rainfall to Southern California.

Security breach at Capitol: 18-year-old held after running toward federal building with loaded shotgun,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/security-breach-at-capitol-18-year-old-held-after-running-toward-federal-building-with-loaded-shotgun/articleshow/128489522.cms,"How the events unfolded

Federal oversight





The US Capitol police detained an 18-year-old man after he ran toward the west side of the Capitol building, carrying a loaded shotgun, prompting a swift law enforcement response.Authorities said the incident is under investigation, including whether members of Congress were the intended target. The arrest comes a week before President Donald Trump’s scheduled State of the Union address, though officials said security plans remain unchanged.According to Capitol police chief Michael Sullivan, the suspect parked a Mercedes SUV near the Capitol before exiting the vehicle and running several hundred yards toward the building while armed with a shotgun.Officers quickly intercepted him and ordered him to drop the weapon and lie on the ground, after which he was taken into custody without injuries.Sullivan said the shotgun was loaded, and the suspect was carrying additional ammunition.Police also recovered a tactical vest and gloves worn by the suspect, while a Kevlar helmet and gas mask were found inside the vehicle.Authorities said they have video footage of the incident and have appealed to members of the public to share any additional recordings that may assist the investigation.The suspect has been identified as Carter Camacho, an 18-year-old from Smyrna, Georgia.Police said he was not previously known to authorities and was not from the Washington area. Officials also noted that the vehicle used in the incident was not registered in his name and that he has multiple listed addresses.Camacho is currently being held on charges including unlawful activities, carrying a rifle without a license, possession of an unregistered firearm and possession of unregistered ammunition, according to a Capitol Police press release.Chief Sullivan said the department had recently conducted active shooter drills in nearly the same area where the incident occurred, highlighting the preparedness of officers on duty. “Who knows what would have happened if we hadn’t had officers standing here?” he said during a press briefing.The Capitol has seen similar security incidents in recent years. In 2023, Capitol Police arrested an Atlanta man armed with a rifle after he was spotted in a park near the Senate.Officials emphasised that Tuesday’s arrest will not affect security arrangements for the upcoming State of the Union address, noting that the event is treated with the highest level of security planning.The incident comes amid broader discussions around crime and security in Washington DC.Authorities said crime levels in the city have declined significantly in 2026 compared with 2025, which itself saw a sharp drop from the previous year. Last August, President Trump declared an emergency in the city to address crime, leading to the deployment of more than 2,000 National Guard members along with additional federal law enforcement personnel, many of whom remain stationed across Washington.Separately, a recent encounter involving US Marshals resulted in the death of a Washington resident after authorities responded to a report of a person allegedly threatening to kidnap and harm someone while armed.The incident is under investigation, and local activists have called for greater transparency from officials.","18-year-old man detained after he ran toward Capitol building with loaded shotgun.

Trump makes shocking claims about Jesse Jackson and Obama in tribute to late civil rights leader,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-makes-shocking-claims-about-jesse-jackson-and-obama-in-tribute-to-late-civil-rights-leader/articleshow/128485405.cms,"



Civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson, a close associate of Martin Luther King Jr., passed away at 84 after battling Parkinson's and progressive supranuclear palsy. US President Donald Trump took to Truth Social to post a tribute to the late leader in a post that also made explosive claims about his relationship with former US President Barack Obama.On Tuesday, the President took to his social media platform to pay his respects to the two-time presidential candidate, calling him a ""good man, with lots of personality, grit and ""street smarts."""" He framed his relationship with Jackson as one of mutual respect and admiration and also stated that it was his ""pleasure to help Jesse along the way,"" despite being ""falsely and consistently"" called a racist by ""Radical Left, Democrats ALL. ""Trump then went on to mention the numerous initiatives and instances he helped the late leader with, including ""providing office space for him and his Rainbow Coalition for years in the Trump Building at 4- Wall Street,"" and ""pushed and passed long term funding for Historically Black Colleges & Universities (HBCUs)"" among other things.“Jesse was a force of nature like few others before him. He had much to do with the Election, without acknowledgement or credit, of Barack Hussein Obama, a man who Jesse could not stand,” Trump wrote.Ending his post with ""deepest sympathies and condolences"" to Jackson's family, he added that he ""will be missed"" and signed off, ""President DONALD J. TRUMP.""Trump's post comes in the light of recent accusations of 'racism' against him when he posted an online video of Barack and Michelle Obama depicted as apes on his social media platform, during Black History month and refused to take down the now-deleted video or apologise for it.Obama responded to the video in an interview with journalist Brian Tyler Cohen, calling his successor's behaviour ""deeply troubling"" and labelling it a ""clown show."" “Just days ago Donald Trump put a picture of you, your face on an ape’s body — and so again, we’ve kind of seen the devolution of the discourse,” said Cohen. “How do we come back from the place that we have fallen into?” he asked.“First of all, I think it’s important to recognise that the majority of the American people find this behaviour deeply troubling,” Obama responded. “It is true that it gets attention. It’s true that it’s a distraction, but as I’m travelling around the country, as you’re travelling around the country, you meet people — they still believe in decency, courtesy, kindness.” He stated that there was a ""sort of clown show"" playing out on social media and on television, adding that the sense of propriety and decorum for the office has been lost. “What is true is there doesn’t seem to be any shame about this among people who used to feel like you had to have some sense of decorum and a sense of propriety and respect for the office. So that’s been lost,” he added.As for his relationship with Jackson, the two leaders enjoyed a bond that was occasionally marred by frustration but was dominated largely by support. In 2008, while Obama was running for President, a mic caught the late leader saying a controversial statement about the then-candidate after he made comments about absentee fathers in the African-American community. Jackson later apologised for the remark and also famously cried at Obama's 2008 election win, acknowledging the new President was running ""the last lap"" of the struggle for Black political empowerment.However, Trump has also had a rocky relationship with the Rainbow/PUSH coalition founder. As Trump mentioned in his tribute, the two connected in the 1990s when Trump provided office space to Jackson's coalition. At a 1999 press conference, Jackson referred to the then-business tycoon as a ""friend"" and praised him for ""reaching out and being inclusive.""Cracks appeared between the two associates during the 2016 presidential race when Jackson endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, when Trump was also running. He described Trump as ""affable and social"" in his early years but criticised his campaign ideas for being ""off the main line"" and claimed they could ""destabilise the country.""","US President Donald Trump took to his social media platform to pay his respects to the late civil rights leader Rev.
