Top court declines to halt demolitions near Somnath,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/top-court-declines-to-halt-demolitions-near-somnath/articleshow/113949877.cms,"SC: If Sept 17 order flouted, will order restoration of structures

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday refused to order status quo on alleged illegal demolition drive against properties of Muslims, including a century-old mosque, near Somnath temple, as Gujarat govt said it acted as per law to remove encroachments on govt land abutting the seashore. It said, ""If we find they (govt) are in contempt of SC's Sept 17 order, we'll order status quo ante (reconstruction of the structures as they existed).""A Muslim organisation, 'Summast Patni Muslim Jamat', through senior advocate Sanjay Hegde, alleged the demolition drive was carried out in the wee hours of Sept 28 to raze nine religious structures, including mosques, dargahs and mausoleums, along with homes of 45 caretakers.The organisation sought initiation of contempt proceedings against IAS officer Rajesh Munjhu for carrying out the drive that was in breach of the SC's Sept 17 omnibus direction that ""there shall be no demolition anywhere across the country without seeking leave of this court"".Terming the claim as ""fallacious and misleading"", solicitor general Tushar Mehta on behalf of Gujarat said the demolition drive was carried out strictly in accordance with law to remove encroachments on govt land abutting the Prabhas Patan seashore.

NEW DELHI: Protesting junior doctors in Kolkata called off their "" total cease work "" on Friday and resumed their service while also issuing a 24-hour ultimatum to the Mamata Banerjee government to meet their demands or else they would launch an indefinite hunger strike .The doctors had called for ""total cease work"" demanding better safety and security at medical facilities.The now-called-off strike, which began on October 1, followed an earlier partial return to work on September 21 after a 42-day protest.The initial protest was triggered by the rape and murder of a trainee woman doctor at Kolkata's RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on August 9.""Considering the well-being of the patients, we've decided to call off the 'total cease work', but we are not doing this due to the fear of (West Bengal) government. If our demands are not met within 24 hours, we will be forced to go on a hunger strike,"" said an agitating junior doctor to news agency PTI.The doctor also alleged that one of their colleagues was assaulted by the police during their protest march earlier today.On Wednesday, a protest march was organised by the Junior Doctors' Front in Kolkata, demanding justice for a medic who was raped and murdered.The march, which began at College Street and ended in Esplanade area, was joined by thousands of junior doctors and people from various walks of life. The protesters vowed to continue their agitation until the government takes decisive action.The Bengal Junior Doctors' Front has raised several demands, including the installation of CCTV cameras on hospital premises, round-the-clock security for healthcare workers , and stricter protocols to prevent incidents of violence against medical professionals.The doctors have also highlighted the culture of fear and intimidation within state-run hospitals, alleging that the administration has not provided a safe working environment.""We joined our profession to serve the people, but how can we do so when we constantly live in fear? We don't feel safe in the very places where we are supposed to save lives,"" said another junior doctor.Despite initial promises by the West Bengal government to address the doctors' concerns, the agitating doctors claim that there has been little follow-up action.The government's attempts to broker peace with the doctors have so far been unsuccessful, with state officials urging the medics to return to work and suggesting that police investigations into the alleged murder of the junior doctor are ongoing.","The doctors had called for ""total cease work"" demanding better safety and security at medical facilities.

Hulk Hogan Shares Insights on His New Agreement with WWE

""I signed a five-year deal,""

""I'm going to be 71 years old in a few weeks, but I signed a five-year deal for the licensing and merchandising stuff, and you know the ambassador stuff, if they need me to do something for WrestleMania. I just love doing it.""

Hulk Hogan, born Terry Eugene Bollea, is a retired wrestler but he was a force to be reckoned with in the world of wrestling back in the day. The 1980s saw Hulk Hogan have a significant influence on WWE, which helped the promotion become a crossover success. The WWE Hall of Famer recalled an instance in which he pushed Vince McMahon Sr. to the point that the ""Hulkster"" was finally let go, despite his notion that his celebrity protected him from any negative reaction within the company.During a recent interview with Bartstool Rasslin' , Hogan was questioned regarding the segment of his career he wished he could go back in time.He soon said that he wanted to go back to the ""Golden Era"" or ""boom period"" and recounted the day McMahon sacked him from the "" Rocky III "" movie.Hogan described having to drive to Charlotte for a TV taping with Jim Crockett Promotions while he was in Fall River, Massachusetts, but he had other plans. He said,At that time, Hogan mentioned that he was involved with a ""beautiful"" Japanese woman and spent about 20 weeks each year in Japan, suggesting he was unconcerned about being fired. Interestingly, he revealed that Vince McMahon Jr. eventually reached out to negotiate his return.he recalled. Earlier this year, Hogan also signed a new WWE Legends deal, underscoring his enduring presence in the promotion.Also read: Netflix's Mr. McMahon Docuseries Review: Exploring Vince McMahon's Dual Legacy, Series Leaves You Wanting For More While Hulk Hogan's wrestling career seems to be in the past, he has managed to stay in the headlines throughout this summer. Much of this attention has been quite controversial, ranging from his endorsement of Donald Trump at the Republican National Convention in July to his comments about Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, where he mocked her heritage and even expressed a desire to bodyslam her.Now, Hogan is back in the spotlight for something that is likely to be less divisive. During an appearance on Impaulsive , he informed WWE star Logan Paul, who is no stranger to controversy himself, that he has signed a new contract with WWE that will keep him linked to the promotion for several more years.Hogan stated.This new agreement continues Hogan's association with WWE, which has been intermittent since the late 1970s. It appeared to come to a definitive end in 2015 when racist remarks he made on video resulted in WWE releasing him from his ambassador role and removing him from the WWE Hall of Fame. However, three years later, Hogan was reinstated to the Hall of Fame and controversially returned to the company, where he has served as an ambassador and made occasional TV appearances since then.Also read: CM Punk has hilarious banter with the DX duo backstage at NXT CW debut","Hulk Hogan has signed a new five-year deal with WWE.

While recounting her trip to authorities, she noted that she was driving behind several trucks when she encountered a slower vehicle, which prompted her to accelerate and pass it at high speed.“I was behind this boxy maybe trailer or RV. And he was going super duper slow, so I passed him,” she recalled, seemingly unaware of the tragedy that unfolded after that.When asked about the tanker truck, she said, “I heard that maybe it flipped” and went off the road. She claimed not to have seen or heard the crash, merely noticing the emergency vehicles heading in the opposite direction.Dashcam footage would later reveal a different story. The video captured the moment the teen cut off the anhydrous ammonia tanker while attempting to pass at approximately 90 mph. The ensuing jackknife maneuver led the truck to collide with a utility trailer parked just off the highway, puncturing the tank and releasing thousands of gallons of the caustic chemical into the air. This toxic plume forced the evacuationof nearly 500 people for hours.When confronted with the dashcam video, the teen said, “Oh, (expletive). Yeah. Oh, my goodness. Yep, totally my bad. Wow. Holy (expletive),” acknowledging her role in the accident that had devastating consequences.The accident that occurred near Teutopolis , Illinois, resulted in the death of five people including a father and his two children and prompted the evacuation of over 500 residents in the vicinity.","A 17-year-old from Ohio admitted to causing a catastrophic crash on September 29, 2023 involving a tanker truck carrying toxic ammonia.

Who is Hashem Safieddine?

NEW DELHI: Israeli warplanes conducted a series of intense airstrikes on Wednesday night targeting Hashem Safieddine , cousin and possible successor of the recently assassinated Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah .The bombardment was one of the most severe in the region since Israel killed Nasrallah, but it remains unclear whether Safieddine, who was believed to be attending a meeting with senior Hezbollah officials, was killed in the strikes.This attempted assassination is the latest effort by Israel to systematically eliminate Hezbollah's leadership, following their invasion of southern Lebanon earlier in the week.Hashem Safieddine, born in southern Lebanon in the early 1960s, is one of Hezbollah's founding members. He joined the Shiite Muslim group in the 1980s during Lebanon's civil war and quickly rose through the ranks alongside Nasrallah.Safieddine held various positions, including political, spiritual, and cultural leadership roles as well as overseeing the group's military activities at one point. Like Nasrallah, Safieddine often wore a black turban, signifying his status as a revered Shiite cleric.In 1995, he was promoted to the group's highest council and soon after he was appointed the head of the military operations of Hezbollah. In 1998, Safieddine was elected to lead the party's executive council, a position previously held by Nasrallah before his appointment as Hezbollah's secretary-general in 1992.Like Nasrallah, Safieddine studied in Iran, forming strong ties with Tehran during his religious studies in Qom before returning to Lebanon to work for Hezbollah.Safieddine's son Reza Hashem Safieddine married Zeinab Suleimani, daughter of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, an Iranian commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps' Quds Force, who was killed by a US airstrike in Baghdad in 2020. The wedding was highly publicized and was largely viewed as a symbol of Iran's deep involvement in Hezbollah.In May 2017, the United States and Saudi Arabia designated Safieddine as a terrorist due to his leadership role in Hezbollah. US has classified Hezbollah as a terrorist organization since 1997, holding the group accountable for numerous attacks that claimed the lives of hundreds of Americans, including the 1983 suicide truck bombings of the US embassy and Marine barracks in Beirut, the 1984 US embassy annex bombing in Beirut, and the 1985 hijacking of TWA flight 847.","Israeli warplanes conducted a series of intense airstrikes on Wednesday night targeting Hashem Safieddine.

US vice president Kamala Harris is set to meet with Arab American and Muslim leaders in Flint, Michigan, on Friday as her presidential campaign seeks to regain support from voters frustrated with US backing of Israel's military actions in Gaza and Lebanon. This meeting is part of a broader effort to reconnect with Muslim and Arab voters who previously backed Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 election but may now withhold their votes from Harris.Harris is expected to engage with representatives from Emgage, the American Task Force on Lebanon, and Hala Hijazi, a long-time friend who has suffered personal losses in Gaza, as reported by Reuters news agency. Sources familiar with the plans, who requested anonymity, indicated that leaders from the Uncommitted National Movement protest campaign were not invited to the meeting, while Jim Zogby, founder of the Arab American Institute, declined the invitation.On Wednesday, Harris' national security adviser, Phil Gordon, held a virtual meeting with community leaders to reaffirm the administration's commitment to a ceasefire in Gaza, diplomatic efforts in Lebanon, and stability in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Additionally, during a Zoom call with Muslim voters , Minnesota governor Tim Walz , Harris’ vice-presidential pick, assured that Muslims would play an equal role in a Harris administration.Some Arab Americans express concern that Kamala's alignment with President Biden's Middle East policies could negatively impact her support. Ali Dagher, a Lebanese American attorney, said, “Harris is going to lose Michigan. I will not be voting for Kamala Harris. No one I know will vote for her.”Polls suggest that Harris and Trump hold nearly equal levels of support among Arab Americans. Harris has been focusing on labour issues, recently celebrating a union deal in Redford Township, Michigan, and planning to vow support for the state's auto industry alongside United Auto Workers Union President Shawn Fain.Harris, a Democrat, is gearing up for a challenging presidential race against Republican former President Donald Trump on November 5.","US vice president Kamala Harris is set to meet with Arab American and Muslim leaders in Flint, Michigan, on Friday.

President Joe Biden expressed doubts on Friday about the likelihood of November elections being peaceful in the wake of what he said were inflammatory remarks made by Donald Trump , the Republican candidate, who continues to deny the legitimacy of his loss in the 2020 presidential race. The 81-year-old president suggested that while he believes the will be “free and fair,” he cannot guarantee it will be “peaceful.”Biden’s comments came in response to a question from National Public Radio’s Tamara Keith about the political climate leading up to the election.“The things that [former President Donald] Trump has said and the things that he said last time out when he didn’t like the outcome of the election were very dangerous,” Biden said, emphasising his worries over the acceptance of election results. He added, “Have you noticed? I noticed that the vice presidential Republican candidate [Ohio Sen. JD Vance] did not say he’d accept the outcome of the election and hasn’t even accepted the outcome of the last election. So I’m concerned about what they’re going to do.”The president’s appearance caught many off guard, as several seats in the briefing room were empty, and most of the reporters focused their questions on the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. Biden has recently increased his press appearances, marking a significant shift from his previous limited interaction with the media.Biden faced backlash for his recent comments, including a slip regarding “Hurricane Helena” during discussions about Hurricane Helene . When a reporter asked if he was considering rejoining the presidential race, he jokingly responded, “I’m back in!” prompting laughter in the room.","US President Joe Biden expressed doubts on Friday about the likelihood of November elections being peaceful.

In a recent hearing, CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig accused Special Counsel Jack Smith of bending legal procedures to undermine former US President Donald Trump ’s electoral prospects . In a piece for 'New York' magazine titled “Jack Smith’s October Cheap Shot,” Honig criticised Smith’s actions following a new court filing related to Trump’s claim of immunity from prosecution, as reported by Fox News.Smith, who has brought multiple charges against Trump, submitted a 165-page filing with Judge Tanya Chutkan , exceeding the typical limit of 45 pages.Judge Chutkan made the bulk of the document public after eliminating several names. This move comes after earlier efforts to fast-track Trump’s immunity hearing ahead of the November 5 presidential election , despite Judge Chutkan now saying she does not consider the election in her rulings.Honig argues that Smith’s actions are meant to weaken Trump's chances in the upcoming election. ""Smith has essentially abandoned any pretense; he'll bend any rule, switch up on any practice — so long as he gets to chip away at Trump's electoral prospects,"" Honig wrote. He added that this conduct ""violates core Department of Justice principles.""In federal criminal procedures, the defence typically files a motion following an indictment, and the prosecution responds. However, according to Honig, Smith overturned this process by filing his brief, without waiting for a defence motion. Although Judge Chutkan admitted the move was ""procedurally irregular,"" she ruled in Smith’s favour.Smith had earlier raised concerns that Trump's public comments might influence a jury, but now, according to Honig, he is using grand-jury testimony—normally kept secret at this point—in a way that could harm Trump, without giving him the chance to respond or challenge it.Trump, who has pleaded not guilty to all charges, continues to argue that he is immune from prosecution related to the cases Smith is pursuing.","CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig accused Special Counsel Jack Smith of bending legal procedures to undermine former US President Donald Trump's electoral prospects.

Floodwaters from the hurricane have disturbed wasp nests, leading to increased stinging incidents and prompting US health officials to stock up on allergy medications , as reported by Sky News.The storm, which has resulted in at least 215 fatalities and left communities from Florida’s Gulf Coast to Virginia’s Appalachian Mountains grappling with recovery, has worsened the risk of wasp encounters.Summer Tonizzo, a press assistant at North Carolina’s Department of Health and Human Services, confirmed that officials are working to ensure that allergy medications, such as Benadryl and EpiPens, are readily available in western North Carolina. “We are actively working to ensure Benadryl and epinephrine are readily available in western North Carolina for those who may be allergic or have been stung,” she said.Many wasps have become more aggressive with the destruction of their homes and nests. Tarren Pruitt, a registered nurse from West Jefferson, North Carolina, reported noticing a surge in wasp activity since the hurricane, saying that numerous workers have been stung while restoring power. Chris Hayes, an extension associate in urban entomology at North Carolina State University, explained that wasps tend to become more aggressive as the season changes, with food sources dwindling and their populations declining.Most people may not be allergic to wasp stings but can still experience pain, itching, or swelling. While Benadryl can help alleviate these symptoms, EpiPens are crucial for individuals facing severe allergic reactions, which can be life-threatening. The National Park Service is advising residents in affected areas to exercise caution and to move away from disturbed nests while covering their faces.Dozens or possibly hundreds of people remain unaccounted for following the hurricane's devastation. The storm’s impact has prompted President Joe Biden to pledge federal support for recovery efforts, with power restoration and communications still lacking in many areas.","Floodwaters from the hurricane have disturbed wasp nests, leading to increased stinging incidents.

The two prominent Republicans will be briefed on storm damage in Evans, Georgia, and are expected to address the press during their visit, as reported by Fox News .This event marks the first time Trump and Kemp have been seen together since their tense relationship following the 2020 presidential election The aftermath of Hurricane Helene has been severe, with the death toll exceeding 220, hundreds still missing, and over 800,000 residents across seven states without power or running water. Damage from the storm is estimated to be in billions.The duo's history is marked by Trump’s ongoing criticism of Kemp for his refusal to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia, where Trump lost by a narrow margin. Trump supported a 2022 primary challenge against Kemp from former senator David Perdue. However, after Kemp won the primary and was re-elected, Trump eased his criticism.During an Atlanta rally in August, Trump called Kemp a “bad guy” and “disloyal” while blaming him for not preventing the indictment against him by a county prosecutor. Just weeks later, Trump surprised many by praising Kemp in a post on X, saying, “I look forward to working with you, your team, and all of my friends in Georgia to help MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”With Trump engaged in a tight presidential race against Vice President Kamala Harris , both he and Kemp have publicly critiqued the federal government’s response to the disaster. In a social media post, Trump said, “It is going down as the WORST & MOST INCOMPETENTLY MANAGED ‘STORM,’ AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL, EVER SEEN BEFORE,” as Harris toured Georgia to meet with local officials and storm victims.Georgia is a vital battleground state for the 2024 election , scheduled for November 5, and Trump is seeking the support of Brian Kemp. In an interview, Kemp stated, “There’s no path for former President Trump or any Republican to reach 270 [electoral votes] without Georgia.” He highlighted his dedication to mobilising Republican voters, asserting, “We need to be telling people why they should vote for us.”","Former US President Donald Trump and Georgia governor Brian Kemp are set to make a joint appearance on Friday for the first time in four years.
