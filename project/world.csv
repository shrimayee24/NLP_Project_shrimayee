KOLKATA: Days after a new mother died at Kolkata's Midnapore Medical College (MMC) allegedly after she was administered expired Ringer's lactate saline, three women whose condition deteriorated along with her were found to have acute kidney injury and required dialysis. These women were also administered the saline after C-section delivery at the hospital. Two are on ventilation, and the third is in the ICU.All three were shifted to SSKM Hospital late on Sunday. While Ringer's lactate is suspected to be the cause, a 13-member committee probing the case is yet to ascertain this. ""The initial suspicion falls on Ringer's lactate, but we have to look into other possible factors,"" said a committee member.Committee members said while the banned Ringer's lactate was used, which was not ideal, the same fluid was used on other patients in other departments where it did not cause any death or deterioration. The members said they will wait for the drug analysis report of the batch of the IV fluid, which may take about two weeks.Five women who underwent C-section at MMC on Wednesday fell ill after the procedure. Mamoni Ruidas (22) died two days later, and three are critical. Families alleged their condition deteriorated after they were administered Ringer's lactate, which is used for replenishing fluid.","Five women who underwent C-section at Kolkata's Midnapore Medical College fell ill after the procedure.

Now, shops and garages all over Nashik city are providing them to those keen on avoiding stitches.Every year during kite-flying season, Nashik records several cases of two-wheeler riders sustaining severe injuries. Citizens TOI spoke to said the rods may now be the only solution.""My sister got me a rod from Ahmedabad, where she lives. I was talking to her about the threat we all face in Nashik from nylon manja. We've had at least nine injury cases recently. One person ended up with 75 stitches to his neck,"" said Vaishali Jagtap, who works in the city's CIDCO area.Another resident, Jyoti Patil, said the rod she's installed on her scooter may protect her child. ""I pick her up from school every day. This solution works best for me and her,"" Patil, who lives near Gangapur Road, said.Some citizens have also held awareness campaigns to promote the accessory. Deepak Doke of the citizen group, Gunaratna Arogya Va Kashalya Vikas Kendra, said they've installed the rods on more than 500 vehicles, for free. ""Many think the rods look odd. But they save lives. Our effort is small, but we hope people start to think more about the dangers of manja when they see them installed on bikes or scooters,"" Doke said.Businessman Sanjay Salvi said it's now largely up to citizens to protect themselves. ""Last year, a woman on a scooter died after manja slit her throat. She was on the Dwarka flyover when it happened,"" he said, adding that he's received many enquiries from neighbours and friends after he installed the rod on his bike.And demand has gone up. ""I remember last year people had rejected the solution. This year, given the rising number of manja injuries, more people have asked for it,"" said Sagar Sonawane, whose shop sells the rods.Police on their part have welcomed the installations. Authorities haven't yet objected because the rods don't impede vision, and their own efforts against nylon manja have fallen woefully short. ""I sincerely hope demand for manja falls. We've so far externed as many as 74 people who were caught selling the thread. The action will intensify,"" said a senior police officer, while urging those on two-wheelers to wear helmets.","Nashik records several cases of two-wheeler riders sustaining severe injuries during kite-flying season.

During an interview recently, Gutfeld targeted Swift's height and declared her a six at best. Gutfeld said, “Taylor Swift is a six at best,” sparking loud cheers from the audience.Gutfeld described ""The Trump Effect"" as the freedom to say what people knew, as opposed to what the media was saying, without fear of retribution.

Former Labour MP Ivor Caplin was arrested in Brighton following a sting operation conducted by a group of citizen pedophile hunters, according to media reports.Online footage shows a man, alleged to be Caplin, being handcuffed by police on suspicion of engaging in inappropriate online communication with a minor. This development comes shortly after Caplin made headlines for his criticism of tech billionaire Elon Musk.Ivor Caplin was born into a Jewish family in Brighton. He is married to Maureen, and has one son and one daughter. Before entering politics, Caplin worked as a marketing professional, according to the BBC.Ivor Caplin began his political journey in 1991 when he was elected to Hove Borough Council. He was elected to the new Brighton and Hove council in 1996 and served as deputy leader.Caplin was elected as the Member of parliament for Hove in 1997 and was re-elected in 2001. He held several important positions including the Minister for veterans at the Ministry of defence. He stood down from the House of commons after the 2005 general election, as mentioned on the UK Parliament website.After leaving Parliament, Caplin founded a company offering services to clients, including political lobbying firms, among others. He also chaired the Jewish Labour Movement from 2018 to 2019.In 2010, Caplin was caught up in the MPs' expenses scandal when Sir Thomas Legg conducted an independent audit of MPs' expenses. Caplin was ordered to repay £17,865 for mortgage interest payments claimed on his second home, as he could not provide paperwork to justify the claim. After an appeal, the amount was reduced to £1,178.43, according to a report by The Guardian.In June 2024, Caplin was suspended from the Labour Party due to “serious allegations” against him, though the details of these allegations have not been made public.Caplin recently made headlines for his criticism of Elon Musk. During a television appearance, Caplin condemned Musk’s tweets targeting Labour leader Keir Starmer and MP Jess Phillips, calling them “unfounded” and “completely unacceptable.”In response to Caplin’s arrest, Musk posted on X, saying, “What a creep.”Caplin was arrested on Saturday for reportedly attempting to arrange a meeting with a 15-year-old boy when he was detained. In the video, officers can be seen taking a wallet from the man, who is dressed in a red baseball cap and a long grey overcoat, before placing it into an evidence bag.Sussex police confirmed the arrest, saying “We are aware of footage circulating on social media showing a man in Brighton being detained on suspicion of engaging in online communication with a child. Officers can confirm that a local 66-year-old man was arrested on Saturday, January 11, and currently remains in custody. This is an ongoing and active investigation,” Mirror wrote.","Ivor Caplin was arrested in Brighton following a sting operation conducted by a group of citizen pedophile hunters, according to media reports.

Los Angeles Wildfires: Rare ‘Fire Tornado’ Swirls Through As Palisades Blaze Rages | California

US President-elect Donald Trump intensified criticism of California officials on Sunday, labelling them “incompetent” for failing to extinguish the Los Angeles wildfires that have ravaged the state since Tuesday.Writing on his Truth Social platform, Trump said, “The fires are still raging in LA The incompetent pols have no idea how to put them out.” ""This is one of the worst catastrophes in the history of our Country. They just can't put out the fires. What's wrong with them?"" he added.Trump’s remarks have escalated tensions with California Governor Gavin Newsom, who accused the president-elect of politicising the disaster.Appearing on NBC’s Meet the Press, Newsom said he had extended an invitation to Trump to visit the affected areas, “in the spirit of cooperation,” but had yet to receive a response. Newsom also criticised Trump’s threats to withhold federal disaster assistance, saying such actions would endanger the work of first responders.Trump further accused Newsom of blocking access to water resources over environmental concerns—a claim the governor’s office denied, stating that no such water restrictions existed. In a statement, Newsom’s team said the administration was “focused on saving lives and supporting firefighters, not playing politics.”The rapid spread and intensity of the wildfires tearing through Los Angeles have strained the city’s firefighting capabilities and sparked criticism about California’s level of preparedness.","US President-elect Donald Trump intensified criticism of California officials on Sunday, labelling them “incompetent” for failing to extinguish the Los Angeles wildfires.

Known for his controversial claims, Biggs says he has received a divine vision of a catastrophic earthquake set to devastate the United States.According to Biggs, the earthquake—a 10-magnitude event—will wreak havoc along the New Madrid fault line , a seismic zone that spans Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Illinois, the Metro reported.Sharing the chilling details of his vision, he described a scenario where thousands would perish, homes built on cinder blocks would crumble to the ground, and the course of the Mississippi River would be altered.“It was so big, there were 1,800 people who died [along that stretch],” Biggs said. “All the houses on cinder blocks were completely shaken to the foundation, they just fell. [The] New Madrid earthquake [is] so big [and] when it happens the Mississippi River starts it goes out another direction.”Adding a theological dimension to his prophecy, Biggs claims this catastrophic event will occur three days after an attempt to implement a two-state solution dividing Jerusalem.Biggs rose to prominence in certain circles after claiming he had predicted an assassination attempt on former US President Donald Trump. He alleges that three months before the incident, he posted a video describing how a bullet would narrowly miss Trump’s head, causing damage to his eardrum.The pastor frequently shares his prophecies on his YouTube channel.

South Korea: 'Real Reason' Behind Plane Crash That Killed 179 Is Finally Out? Jeju Air Probe

Crucial data is missing from the black boxes of the Jeju Air plane that crashed at Muan International Airport , claiming 179 lives, on December 29, the South Korean transport ministry said on Saturday. The flight data and voice recorders from the Boeing 737-800 stopped functioning approximately four minutes before the crash, according to the ministry.Former transport ministry accident investigator Sim Jai-dong said, ""The discovery of the missing data from the crucial final minutes was surprising and suggests all power, including backup, may have been cut, which is rare,"" according to a Reuters report.The voice recorder was initially examined in South Korea but was later sent to a US national transportation safety board laboratory when missing data was discovered, the ministry confirmed. The damaged flight data recorder was sent to the US for analysis in collaboration with the US safety regulator.""A joint investigation team comprising Korean and US officials is trying to determine what caused the devices to stop working,"" the ministry said.The ministry assured that other available data would be used in the investigation, stressing transparency and a commitment to keeping the victims' families informed. However, some family members of the victims expressed concerns, suggesting that the transport ministry should not lead the investigation. They advocated for the inclusion of independent experts, including those recommended by the families.The plane, Jeju Air flight 7C2216, was en route from Bangkok, Thailand, to Muan International Airport, South Korea, when it crashed into an embankment during an attempted landing. Approximately four minutes before the crash, the pilots reported a bird strike and declared an emergency. Air traffic control had warned of ""bird activity"" two minutes before the emergency call.The pilots attempted to abort the landing, but the plane turned sharply and crash-landed without its landing gear deployed. The crash claimed the lives of 179 of the 181 people on board.Authorities are still investigating the cause of the accident. The investigation also focuses on the embankment the plane struck, particularly why it was constructed with such rigid material and placed so close to the runway.","Flight data and voice recorders from the Boeing 737-800 stopped functioning approximately four minutes before the crash.

'They are merely two nitwit celebrities'

As Meghan Markle and Prince Harry went to the Pasadena Convention Center Friday to meet the victims of the Eaton fire and the first responders in their latest attempt to stand by the people in the moment of distress, social media users asked they behave like royals even after stepping down from royal duties. According to reports, it was not a planned press visit and they wanted to meet the victims without creating any ripple in the media, but videos of their visit are all over social media.One report said they were serving food at the evacuation center anonymously but on Friday they took time to meet those who were affected.Both of them wore hats apparently to keep a low profile -- with their face not fully revealing. Meghan wore baseball hats and Harry chose a black Cali hat. They were seen speaking to the mayor in one video; and to a woman in another video. Meghan was seen teary-eyed hugging a woman in a viral photo.New York Post reported that the Duke and Duchess were focused on supporting and helping both physically and emotionally without causing chaos. The pair began their visit by serving meals alongside volunteers from chef Jose Andrés’ World Central Kitchen (WCK) outside the Convention Center, accompanied by the First Partner of California, Jennifer Siebel Newsom. Meghan and Harry later returned to the Pasadena Convention Center to meet with José Andrés, whose World Central Kitchen has been providing food to fire victims and first responders at pop-up food stations around LA County.Harry-Meghan haters who are not few in numbers on social media asked why they went to the centers behaving like they were still royals. ""Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, always willing to exploit a tragedy to promote themselves. It’s disgusting. And her and Harry’s attempts to still act like royals is appalling. They are merely two nitwit celebrities with a failing brand, and yet the mayor of Pasadena and Gavin Newsom’s wife are with them. Why? They offer nothing. They both need to get it through their thick heads that THEY ARE NOT ROYALS HERE. Just donate, maybe volunteer, but stop acting like you’re anything else. Royals represent their people and government, the cosplay royals represent nothing but their own greed. I’m sure Meghan is also panicking that her show and triumphant return will be wrecked by Mother Nature,"" one post read.Another claimed that Meghan actually got distracted while talking to a fire victim because ""she is looking for her next photo op moment"".Mayor Gordo said Harry and Meghan did not come out for publicity and genuinely came to work.","Meghan Markle and Prince Harry went to the Pasadena Convention Center Friday to meet the victims of the Eaton fire and the first responders.

What to know about the devastation from the Los Angeles-area fires,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-to-know-about-the-devastation-from-the-los-angeles-area-fires/articleshow/117185889.cms,"LOS ANGELES: Fires ripping through the Los Angeles area have killed at least 24 people, displaced thousands of others and destroyed more than 12,000 structures while burning through an area larger than the city of San Francisco.Authorities confirmed eight fatalities in the Palisades Fire zone and 16 in the Eaton Fire zone. Details about the victims' identities have not been disclosed.The blazes started last Tuesday, fueled by fierce Santa Ana winds that forecasters expect to kick back up through at least midweek. Cal Fire reported the Palisades, Eaton, Kenneth and Hurst fires had consumed about 62 square miles (160 square kilometers).Five deaths were attributed to the Palisades Fire along the coast and 11 deaths resulted from the Eaton Fire further inland, the LA County medical examiner's office said. At least 16 people were missing, and authorities said that number was expected to rise.While a cause for the fires has yet to be determined, early estimates indicate they could be the nation's costliest ever. Preliminary estimates by AccuWeather put the damage and economic losses at between $135 billion and $150 billion.Here's a closer look at what to know about the fires.Thousands remain evacuated or without power The flames have threatened and burned through several highly populated neighborhoods over the past week, including Pacific Palisades, Altadena and others.About 150,000 people were under evacuation orders with more than 700 taking refuge in nine shelters. Officials said Sunday most of those orders were unlikely to be lifted before the red flag warnings of expected high winds expire Wednesday evening.Cal Fire reported containment of the Palisades Fire at 11% and the Eaton Fire at 27% on Sunday.The Kenneth Fire, which broke out near West Hills in the San Fernando Valley, was 100% contained as of Sunday morning, while the Hurst Fire was 89% contained.Nearly 70,000 customers were without power across California as of Sunday morning, more than half of them in Los Angeles County, according to PowerOutage.us, which tracks outages nationwide.Sewer, water and power infrastructure across the region has been significantly damaged, officials said.The National Weather Service warned that strong Santa Ana winds could soon return and issued red flag warnings for severe fire conditions through Wednesday. The winds have been largely blamed for turning the wildfires into infernos that leveled entire neighborhoods around the city where there has been no significant rainfall in over eight months.Thousands have fled and many have lost their homes, including Hollywood stars Billy Crystal and Mandy Moore and Los Angeles Lakers head coach JJ Redick.The fires have scorched more than just landmarks and celebrity homes While the fires have reduced a number of celebrity mansions and movie landmarks to ashes, they also burned through a haven in Altadena for generations of Black families avoiding discriminatory housing practices elsewhere. They have been communities of racial and economic diversity, where many people own their own homes.The fires have destroyed several places of worship, including a mosque, a synagogue, a Catholic parish and a half-dozen Protestant churches.Investigators are studying the cause of the fires No cause has been determined yet for the fires.Lightning is the most common source of fires in the US, according to the National Fire Protection Association, but investigators quickly ruled that out. There were no reports of lightning in the Palisades area or the terrain around the Eaton Fire, which started in east Los Angeles County.The next two most common causes are fires intentionally set and those sparked by utility lines.Several events have been canceled and postponed The Critics Choice Awards rescheduled Sunday ceremonies in Santa Monica for Jan. 26.The organization that puts on the Oscars extended the voting window for Academy Award nominations and delayed next week's planned nominations announcement.The NFL moved the Los Angeles Rams' wild-card playoff game against the Minnesota Vikings to Arizona because of the fires. The game will be played Monday night. And the NBA postponed the Lakers' game against the Hornets.NBA games are scheduled to return to Los Angeles on Monday night, with the Clippers hosting the Miami Heat and the Lakers set to host the San Antonio Spurs. It'll be the Clippers' first game in five days after having their home game against Charlotte on Saturday postponed. The Lakers had two home games pushed back.Accusations of leadership failures are percolating LA Mayor Karen Bass faces a critical test of her leadership during the city's greatest crisis in decades, but allegations of leadership failures, political blame and investigations have begun.California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday ordered state officials to determine why a 117 million-gallon (440 million-liter) reservoir was out of service and some hydrants had run dry.Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley said city leadership failed her department by not providing enough money for firefighting. She also criticized the lack of water.","Authorities confirmed eight fatalities in the Palisades Fire zone and 16 in the Eaton Fire zone.

WASHINGTON: Jack Smith , the special counsel appointed to investigate Donald Trump for his alleged effort to overturn results of the 2020 election, has left the US Department of Justice , prosecutors said Saturday in a court filing.""The Special Counsel completed his work and submitted his final confidential report on January 7, 2025, and separated from the Department on January 10,"" officials said in the document submitted to US District Judge Aileen Cannon, urging her to not extend her order last week blocking the release of Smith's final report.The statement on Smith was a footnote in the filing to Cannon as she mulls whether to maintain a hold on the special counsel's report on two cases: Trump's role in the January 6, 2020 insurrection at the US Capitol aimed at halting certification of Joe Biden's victory, and the case of Trump's withholding of classified documents after he left the White House.With the hold set to expire in the coming days and Cannon considering an extension, the protracted legal fight over the report on Trump-related cases is coming down to the week or so before he is inaugurated as America's 47th president on January 20.Trump suggested in a late night post on his Truth Social platform that Smith has been ""fired"" by the Department of Justice.""He is a disgrace to himself, his family, and his Country. After spending over $100,000,000 on the Witch Hunt against TRUMP, he left town empty handed!"" he wrote.Smith had accused Trump of conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, the session of Congress called to certify Biden's election win but which was violently attacked on January 6 by a mob of the Republican leader's supporters.Smith dropped the cases against Trump after he won November's presidential election.On January 7, the special counsel finalized his confidential report to US Attorney General Merrick Garland, and the Justice Department said this week that Garland plans to publicly release the findings.Department officials have argued that Cannon does not have the power to block the attorney general from releasing Smith's report.","Jack Smith, the special counsel appointed to investigate Donald Trump for his alleged effort to overturn results of the 2020 election, has left the US Department of Justice.

LA Fire Latest News: Private drone makes hole in Canadian Super Scooper plane fighting LA fires: 'What a jacka**',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/private-drone-makes-hole-in-canadian-super-scooper-plane-fighting-la-fires-what-a-jacka/articleshow/117181718.cms,"A private drone made a hole in a firefighting plane.

A private drone came in the way of a Super Scooper aircraft fighting the Palisades Fire forcing it to be grounded. The drone made a hole in the wing of the firefighting plane making it out of service though there were no injuries. Los Angeles authorities vowed to prosecute illegal drone fights after this incident as irate people asked who the idiot was flying the drone obstructing the emergency operation.The specifically designed CL-415 firefighting planes are used to scoop up more than 1,500 gallons of ocean water to drop on active fires.Photos released by the FBI showed the drone put a large hole in the aircraft’s wing, with the damage causing about a 30-minute delay in the aerial firefight, ABC 7 reported.“I’d just like to stress, that technique, using that super scooper aircraft, are our most effective technique to fight fires like this, and when this happens, it puts everybody’s lives at risk,” said Akil Davis, the assistant director in charge of the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office.“Our biggest concern is that there are so many unauthorized drones in the area that they are impacting law enforcement and firefighters’ efforts to suppress this fire and actually get it contained,” said Davis.“When you take one plane out of commission like that, it’s going to impact the speed in which the fire grows, it’s going to cause loss of property, potentially loss of life, and it’s a danger to everybody all around,” Davis continued.According to the latest updates, 11 people have been killed in the Eaton fire, near Pasadena, and five died in the Palisades fire, on the west side of Los Angeles. The authorities have warned that conditions are expected to worsen in the coming days as devastating wildfires continue to rage across different parts of Los Angeles County, leading to widespread disruptions, including school closures and the cancellation of entertainment, sports, and community events.",A private drone came in the way of a Super Scooper aircraft fighting the Palisades Fire forcing it to be grounded.

Harry Meghan LA Fire: LA fire victim asks Prince Harry if he can get him a donut: 'I will vote for you',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/la-fire-victim-asks-prince-harry-if-he-can-get-him-a-donut-i-will-vote-for-you/articleshow/117180542.cms,"Harry and Meghan went to visit LA fire victims which has been slammed as a PR stunt.

'Why pick on Meghan Markle'

As Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are facing a major backlash for 'touring' through the Los Angeles fire ravages and getting clicked for their 'anonymous' voluntary work, a new story has surfaced about a victim's interaction with Prince Harry.Pasadena mayor Victor Gordo who has been asserting that the Sussexes were not there publicity said a fire victim asked Prince Harry for a donut. “[Harry] says, ‘There’s no donut here, but I will find one,'” Gordo narrated the story. “He (Harry) takes off, and 10 minutes later, he returns with a donut,"" Gordo said.“The gentleman looks up and says, ‘I guess I need my carbs and my sugar.'”Gordo narrated the event to hammer home the fact that the man had no idea that it was Prince Harry and Harry was wearing a mask and a cap. ""If you ever run for anything, I'll vote for you,"" the man told Prince Harry not knowing that he was not a politician.Social media is largely divided over Meghan Markle and Harry's visit to evacuation centers where they were seen interacting with people, and comforting victims. People asked why there were camerapersons if they wanted to be anonymous about their service. According to one report, the residents were enraged that Harry and Meghan were given a 'quasi-royal' tour while the residents have not been allowed to go back to their places.Harry and Meghan announced that they would open their Montecito mention to loved ones who were forced to evacuate. Harry-Meghan haters said they managed to pivot the tragedy toward themselves acting like royals and issuing acstatement which was not at all necessary. Meghan fans countered the attacks on social media and said Meghan Markle is always picked on for whatever she does while other celebrities are being praised for doing the same thing.","Pasadena mayor Victor Gordo said a fire victim asked Prince Harry for a donut.

JD Vance: Is JD Vance not on the same page with Trump on pardoning Jan 6 rioters? 'A little bit of gray area',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/is-jd-vance-not-on-the-same-page-with-trump-on-pardoning-jan-6-rioters-a-little-bit-of-gray-area/articleshow/117178045.cms,"JD Vance said pardoning Jan 6 rioters on day 1 is a gray area.

Vice-President-elect JD Vance refused to commit that the Jan 6 rioters would be pardoned by Donald Trump the day he takes the administration over and said those who are convicted of violent crimes should not be pardoned. This is not what Donald Trump said as he promised sweeping pardons on day one of his administration for anyone involved in those riots. “Those people have suffered long and hard,” he said adding that there might be some exceptions but he would look at individual cases.More than 1,250 people were convicted or pleaded guilty for their role in the Capitol riot, with charges ranging from trespassing to seditious conspiracy. Several rioters sought to attack top-elected officials, including Rep. Nancy Pelosi and then-Vice President Mike Pence.“I think it’s very simple,” Vance told Bream. “If you protested peacefully on January the 6th and you’ve had [Attorney General] Merrick Garland’s Department of Justice treat you like a gang member, you should be pardoned. If you committed violence on that day, obviously you shouldn’t be pardoned.”“There’s a little bit of a gray area there, but we’re very much committed to seeing the equal administration of law, and there are a lot of people, we think, in the wake of January 6 who were prosecuted unfairly,” Vance said.Some Republican lawmakers have urged Trump to issue pardons for all January 6 rioters . Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a close Trump ally, told the Associated Press last week that those imprisoned over the attacks—regardless of their crime—should be released.“Even the ones that fought Capitol Police, caused damage to the Capitol, I think they’ve served their time, and I think they should all be pardoned and released from prison,” Greene said.","JD Vance said pardoning Jan 6 rioters on day 1 is a gray area.

Right is might: Jaishankar to attend Trump inauguration,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/right-is-might-jaishankar-to-attend-trump-inauguration/articleshow/117177513.cms,".

TOI correspondent Washington:

India's external affairs minister S Jaishankar will join an elite group of mostly right-wing foreign leaders who will attend Donald Trump's inauguration as the 47th US President in a convention-busting event on January 20.Like China's President Xi Jinping , Prime Minister Modi is deputing his top mandarin on the landmark occasion, behooving the traditional non-partisan discretion both nations exercise. But leaders of several other countries, ideologically aligned with Trump, are themselves making a dash to Washington DC to revel in the rise of the right across the world.Among them: Italy's Georgia Meloni, Argentina's Javier Mellei, and Hungary's Victor Orban. Trump has also invited ideological journeymen like Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro, who like him was voted out after a stint in power and claimed the elections were stolen.The US Presidential inauguration is customarily a strictly domestic affair with no record of any foreign leader formally attending one in 248 years.In fact, so insular is the ceremony, typically held on the steps of the Capitol in near-freezing temperatures at noon on January 20, that the State Department, lead agency for foreign interface, sent a letter to embassies ahead of the 2009 Obama inauguration saying “As in the past, foreign delegations will not be invited to Washington for this occasion,” after polite inquiries about a seat at the milestone event that saw the US elect the first black person to the White House.But as with many other conventions he has torpedoed, Trump is set to toss this aside in a celebration of the right although there will be some unusual guests. Among them, El Salvador's outlier president Nayib Bukele and Israeli settlement leaders .Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's attendance though is up in the air after Trump threw a social media grenade over the weekend when he shared post of public policy maven Jeffrey Sachs calling Netanyahu a “deep, dark son of a b*tch” who has been dragging the US into endless wars in the Middle East.Presidential historians are already chalking up notes to highlight this will be an unprecedented inauguration. Aside from Trump becoming only the second US president in history to serve non-consecutive terms, the event will also take place with US flags at half-mast to honor the passing of President Jimmy Carter.Trump and his supporters have expressed disquiet at what they see as a petty action by the outgoing Biden administration although the US flag code prescribes lowering the flags to half-staff for a 30-day period after the death of current and former presidents. Flags were at half-mast at Nixon's second inauguration after President Truman died in the weeks before.Trump himself is piqued about the flag issue. ""The Democrats are all ‘giddy’ about our magnificent American Flag potentially being at ‘half mast’ during my Inauguration. They think it’s so great, and are so happy about it because, in actuality, they don’t love our Country, they only think about themselves. Look at what they’ve done to our once GREAT America over the past four years - It’s a total mess!” he complained last week.""Nobody wants to see this, and no American can be happy about it. Let’s see how it plays out. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” he added, in an indication that he will restore the flag after he is sworn in since the flag code is convention, not law.Foreign attendees though will be more concerned about the weather than the flag. Inauguration Day, January 20, is typically wintry and cold although the oath of office is always set for noon. The story goes that William Harrison, the first US President to die in office, died of pneumonia a month after Inauguration Day where he delivered a two-hour speech and rode in an open horse carriage with no hat or overcoat, attending parties and balls in wet clothes.Current weather forecast for January 20, 2025 shows a maximum temperature of 35F (2C) and a minimum of 19F (-7C).","India's external affairs minister S Jaishankar will join an elite group of mostly right-wing foreign leaders who will attend Donald Trump's inauguration as the 47th US President.

Taliban don’t regard women as human beings: Malala,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/taliban-dont-regard-women-as-human-beings-malala/articleshow/117181022.cms,"Malala

ISLAMABAD: Nobel Peace laureate Malala Yousafzai criticized Taliban on Sunday, saying that they do not regard women as human beings and has established a system of “gender apartheid,” justifying their crimes with cultural and religious excuses.“Taliban do not see women as human beings. They cloak their crimes in cultural and religious justifications. They punish women and girls who dare to defy their opaque laws by beating, arresting, or injuring them,” Malala said at a summit in Islamabad focused on girls’ education in Muslim countries.Since retaking power in Afghanistan in 2021, Taliban regime has enforced a strict interpretation of Islamic law, depriving women of participation in many areas of public life. Their restrictions have prevented women and girls from attending secondary and university schools, as well as holding many govt jobs.“They want to eliminate women and girls from every aspect of public life and erase them from society. These policies have no basis in Islamic teachings,” she said.Malala called on Muslim leaders to demonstrate true leadership by refusing to legitimize Taliban govt. “It is time for Muslim leaders to raise your voices and use your power to oppose such injustices,” she added.Afghanistan's Taliban govt snubbed the event by rejecting the invitation. ""No one from there came to participate in the conference,"" Pakistan's education minister, Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, said.Malala also condemned Israel's actions in Gaza. ""In Gaza, Israel has decimated the entire education system. They have bombed all universities, destroyed more than 90% of schools, and indiscriminately attacked civilians sheltering in school buildings,” Malala said, stressing the urgency of international intervention to protect the rights and future of Palestinian children.","Nobel Peace laureate Malala Yousafzai criticized Taliban on Sunday, saying that they do not regard women as human beings.

BALOCHISTAN: Pakistan security forces have been accused of forcibly disappearing three individuals from Balochistan's Kech and Sibi districts.The alleged detentions are part of an ongoing pattern of enforced disappearances in the region, which has raised significant concern among human rights organizations and local communities, as reported by the Balochistan Post.According to the Balochistan Post, Irshad Ahmed, a young man, was allegedly apprehended by Pakistani forces at a medical store in Turbat. He was reportedly taken to an undisclosed location, with his whereabouts remaining unknown.The Balochistan Post further reported that similarly, Nawaz Nadil, a 17-year-old student from the Balochistan Residential College (BRC), was allegedly detained by military personnel at the Gamshad Hotel in Turbat. His family has expressed deep concern for his safety, as they have not been informed of his location or the reasons for his detention.In a separate incident, Gul Hassan Sabir, a resident of Sibi, was taken by Pakistani forces on the evening of November 19, 2024, at approximately 9 PM. He was detained in front of a bus stop, and his family has been unable to ascertain his whereabouts since the incident.

Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan , currently in Adiala Jail , demanded a transparent investigation and the establishment of a judicial commission to examine violence on November 26 and May 9. He communicated this demand to lawyers and media during a meeting at the jail.Regarding ongoing negotiations in the country, Khan expressed skepticism, stating, ""The government's non-serious attitude towards negotiations is evident from the fact that I haven't even been allowed to meet with my negotiation committee yet. It seems like the purpose of negotiations is merely to waste time so that public reaction over the November 26th Islamabad massacre starts to fade.""Khan called for an impartial judicial commission to investigate the incidents, particularly the November 26 event. ""Peaceful citizens were massacred on November 26th; they were directly shot at, and D-Chowk was drenched in their blood. Many of our people are still missing. In any civilized society, those responsible for such shootings would have been held accountable, but this government has not even managed to form a judicial commission yet. A judicial commission acts as a (neutral) third umpire. Only an impartial commission can provide justice to the martyrs of November 26th (2024) and May 9th (2023). If this massacre is swept under the rug, no one’s life or property in Pakistan will be safe,"" he said.He also alleged mistreatment of PTI members in custody and called for these claims to be raised internationally. ""While in military custody, our innocent people were subjected to severe mental and physical torture. According to my information, three young men attempted suicide during custody. Sami Wazir’s condition is a stark testament to this brutality. What happened to PTI leaders like Shahbaz Gill and Azam Swati is no secret. Zille Shah was brutally murdered, and Intezar Panjutha was treated worse than animals. What kind of justice is this? Those who leave PTI are absolved of any charges related to May 9th, while those who refuse are subjected to all kinds of torture and pressure,"" Khan stated.Further threatening to take the alleges injustice to global forums, the ex-Pakistan PM added, ""We haven't obtained justice despite repeatedly appealing to Pakistan’s judicial system, leaving us with no choice but to raise our voice on international forums. Pakistan’s government is bound by international laws and treaties regarding human rights. I have instructed our lawyers to take these matters to global forums and draw the world’s attention to the ongoing human rights violations in Pakistan.""In connection to the May 9 case, Imran Khan has approached the Lahore High Court for bail, according to ARY News. The case is centred around severe unrest across Pakistan following Imran Khan's arrest on May 9, 2023. Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) supporters demonstrated their outrage through widespread protests in both rural and urban areas, prompting authorities to deploy military forces in Balochistan, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Islamabad to maintain security. During these demonstrations, PTI supporters targeted military facilities, including an assault on the Corps Commander's residence in Lahore. Subsequently, Imran Khan was named as the primary accused in the legal proceedings. The November 26 protests were also centred on similar demands with PTI members demanding release of their leader.Khan also addressed the people of Pakistan saying, ""My message to overseas Pakistanis is that democracy and human rights have been obliterated in Pakistan, to be replaced by the law of the jungle. Your boycott of foreign currency remittances is critical. Your loved ones in Pakistan deserve the same rights that you enjoy abroad.""Khan also talked about the fake allegations and cases against him while putting forward the demand for transparent investigation and justice. ""Our government was falsely accused of resettling the Taliban. Terrorism did not resurface during our tenure, and even a year after it ended. The same people who are responsible for conditions in Balochistan are also responsible for the current chaos,"" he said adding, "" No leader in Pakistan’s history has ever faced 280 cases. This kind of treatment was only meted out to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman during General Yahya's rule, and now it is being done to me.""Additionally, citing a World Bank report, Khan expressed concern about rising poverty and the impact of political instability on the economy. ""according to a recent World Bank report, an additional 13 million people have fallen below the poverty line. Every institution, including the judiciary, NAB, FIA, and police, have been tasked to work against PTI, causing political and economic systems to collapse and instability to reach its peak. Economic growth will remain zero as long as political instability persists. All of this is being done to bolster the plan for a decade-long dictatorship. Anyone who supports this lawlessness can have their corruption of billions pardoned.""According to PTI, Khan has been imprisoned for over 520 days.",Former Pakistan PM Imran Khan is currently in Adiala Jail.
