'Symbols Of British Empire': PM Modi On North & South Block In 1st Address From Seva Teerth

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday paid tributes to the soldiers, that were killed in the Pulwama attack 7 years ago calling them ""brave heroes"".""Remembering the brave heroes who laid down their lives in Pulwama on this day in 2019. Their devotion, resolve and service to the nation remain forever etched in our collective consciousness. Every Indian draws strength from their enduring courage,"" said PM Modi on X.Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi also remembered the soldiers saying, ""My heartfelt tribute to our brave soldiers who were killed in the audacious terrorist attack in Pulwama in 2019. The nation shall forever remain indebted to them for their supreme sacrifice in the defence of Mother India.""Vice President CP Radhakrishnan also paid his tributes on the seventh anniversary of the attack. ""I pay homage to the brave personnel who laid down their lives in the Pulwama terror attack . Their supreme sacrifice will forever remain etched in the nation's memory and continues to inspire us to build a strong and secure India,"" he said.On February 14, 2019, the Pulwama district in Jammu and Kashmir witnessed one of the deadliest terror attacks in Indian history.A convoy of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) travelling along the Srinagar–Jammu National Highway was targeted in a suicide bombing, killing 40 personnel. The date has since been remembered as a “Black Day” in the country’s security narrative.The convoy consisted of 78 buses carrying nearly 2,500 CRPF personnel from Jammu to Srinagar when an explosives-laden vehicle rammed into one of the buses, causing massive casualties and destruction.The attack drew widespread international condemnation and led to an immediate tightening of security protocols across Jammu and Kashmir. The Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammad claimed responsibility, stating that a suicide bomber carried out the assault, according to local media reports.In response, India initiated a series of counter-terror measures, most notably conducting airstrikes on alleged terror training camps across the border in Pakistan. The military action marked a sharp escalation in tensions between the two countries.Beyond its immediate impact, the Pulwama attack reignited global debate over cross-border terrorism, militancy in Jammu and Kashmir, and the broader security dynamics between India and Pakistan.",PM Narendra Modi paid tributes to the soldiers killed in the Pulwama attack 7 years ago.

Married man in SC over dowry complaint by 'live-in partner',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/married-man-in-sc-over-dowry-complaint-by-live-in-partner/articleshow/128326932.cms,"NEW DELHI: Can a married man in a live-in relationship be prosecuted for dowry harassment on the complaint of a woman with whom he was in an extra-marital affair, even though the law specifies that only a wife can make such a complaint against her husband and his relatives?A Supreme Court bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and N K Singh on Friday entertained an appeal by a doctor, Lokesh B H, challenging a Karnataka HC order rejecting his plea for quashing prosecution launched against him based on a complaint filed by his alleged live-in partner.The bench said, ""The pertinent question that arises for consideration in this petition is whether a man, who is in a live-in relationship in the nature of marriage with a woman, can be prosecuted for having committed an offence under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) or its corresponding section in the Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita.""SC sought a response from govt on the issue and requested additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati to assist the court. It also appointed advocate Nina Nariman as amicus curiae.Appearing for the petitioner, senior advocate Sanjay Nuli said the HC erred in interpreting that rigour of Section 498A applies even to a live-in relationship, even though the definition under the IPC section envisages action against the husband by the wife. Section 498A provides that ""whoever being the husband or the relative of the husband of a woman, subjects such woman to cruelty shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall be liable to fine"".Under it, cruelty includes dowry demands, and coercion and ill treatment.In the current case, Lokesh - a cardiologist - was married to Naveena in Feb 2000. It was alleged by another woman, Teertha, that she got married to Lokesh in 2010. In 2015, Teertha lodged several complaints with police against Lokesh, his mother, sister and a cousin, but these were closed.In 2016, Teertha lodged a complaint accusing Lokesh of attempting to burn her while demanding dowry, even though Lokesh's employer certified that on the day of the alleged incident, he was at his workplace - a hospital. She later lodged a domestic violence case against him. Lokesh filed a suit before a family court at Bengaluru seeking a declaration that there was no marital relationship between him and Teertha, which is still pending adjudication. In 2023, the police filed chargesheet against Lokesh for allegedly attempting to burn Teertha and demaning dowry. He challenged this before the HC which dismissed it.","A Supreme Court bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and N K Singh on Friday entertained an appeal by a doctor, Lokesh B H.

NEW DELHI: A heated exchange broke out between Haryana minister Anil Vij and Kaithal Superintendent of Police Upasna during a district grievance redressal meeting on Friday after the officer declined to suspend a policeman in a land-related case, saying she did not have the authority to do so.The incident occurred in Kaithal where Vij, who holds the energy, transport and labour portfolios, was chairing the meeting. A local resident had levelled allegations against an assistant sub-inspector (ASI) in connection with a land sale matter that is currently under investigation.During the proceedings, Vij directed that the ASI be suspended. “I am ordering that till action is taken in the matter, he (the ASI) should be suspended because he can use his influence (in the case),” the minister said.SP Upasna responded that the officer in question belonged to a neighbouring district and was not under her administrative control. “I don't have the power to suspend him. The suspension order in this case can be issued by the Kurukshetra SP,” she said.Vij insisted that she act on his direction. “I am giving orders to suspend him (the ASI),” he told her, asking her to write to the Director General of Police (DGP) for necessary action.The SP maintained her position. “I can write this… But I cannot suspend (the ASI),” she said.As the exchange grew tense, Vij remarked, “In every work, you do like this. I am ordering you that he should be suspended. You write to the DGP… I am telling you, you only have to execute my order.”He added, “‘Mera order sare Haryana mein chalta hai’ (my order is applicable in entire Haryana),” drawing applause from some people present at the meeting, according to a video of the incident.The complainant, who was attending the session, also intervened, saying, “Madam, every time you do like this.”Sensing the situation escalating, Kaithal deputy commissioner Aparajita told the minister that the SP had agreed to write to the DGP. Vij responded, “You write to the DGP that he (the ASI) should be suspended… I will see who doesn’t listen (to the order),” pointing towards the SP.This is not the first time a disagreement has surfaced between Vij and senior police officials during grievance meetings. Three months ago, he had a similar altercation in Kaithal, alleging that a police officer ignored his directive to register a Zero FIR in a fraud case.

‘Is There Any Law?’ Renuka Chaudhary Sparks Row After Bringing Stray Dog to Parliament

NEW DELHI: Congress Rajya Sabha MP Renuka Chowdhury has been served a privilege breach notice for bringing a stray dog into the Parliament complex during the Winter Session and for her remarks about fellow members.According to the notice, she has been asked to respond to the notice by February 23.The motion was moved by Rajya Sabha MPs Brij Lal and Indu Bala Goswami, who alleged that her actions amounted to a breach of parliamentary privilege and protocol.News agency ANI, citing sources close to Chowdhury, reported that she will respond to the notice in accordance with parliamentary rules, norms and conventions.The row began on the opening day of the Winter Session on December 1 when Chowdhury brought a stray puppy to the Parliament premises. She later explained that she had found the animal on her way to Parliament after witnessing a collision between a scooter and a car.“Is there any law? I was on my way. A scooter collided with a car. This little puppy was wandering on the road. I thought it would get hit by the wheel. So I picked it up, put it in the car, came to Parliament, and sent it back. The car left, and so did the dog. So what's the point of this discussion?” she said.Chowdhury maintained that there is no rule preventing an MP from bringing a dog or any animal into Parliament.The matter escalated after the Congress MP made controversial remarks while defending her action. In a swipe at the ruling BJP party, she said, “The real dogs are sitting in Parliament. They run the government. We take care of a mute animal, and this has become a big issue.”Earlier, when asked about the possible privilege motion, she responded by mimicking a dog’s bark. “Bhow, bhow… aur kya bolun?” she said, adding, “We will see when it (the privilege motion) is brought. I will give a 'munhtod' reply.”She also argued that there were more serious issues facing the country. “People are dying because of pollution and no one is worried… Labour laws are being forced upon us… but Renuka Chowdhury’s dog has rattled everyone. What can I say? I will continue to take care of animals,” she remarked.BJP MP Jagdambika Pal criticised her action, calling it a “tamasha” and a breach of protocol. He said members are not permitted to bring anyone into the premises without proper documentation and urged the Chairman to take action.“She is a member of the House and should raise issues of public importance instead of indulging in such drama,” Pal said.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi also reacted to the controversy. “Dog is the main topic of today, I believe. What has the poor dog done. The dog had come here. Why is it not allowed?” he said, adding, “Pets are not allowed here but they are allowed inside.”",Congress Rajya Sabha MP Renuka Chowdhury has been served a privilege breach notice for bringing a stray dog into the Parliament complex.

In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones

Israel Bombs Gaza; Kids Among Several Killed As IDF Claims Attack On Soldier In Northern Strip

NEW DELHI: Author Arundhati Roy has announced that she will not attend the Berlin International Film Festival (Berlinale), where a film she wrote nearly four decades ago is scheduled to be screened in the festival’s Classics section. Roy’s screenplay, written 38 years ago, was selected for screening at Berlinale 2026. In a statement released on Friday, she described the selection as meaningful on a personal level.“In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones, a whimsical film that I wrote 38 years ago, was selected to be screened under the Classics section at the Berlinale 2026. There was something sweet and wonderful about this for me,” she said.However, Roy said she had been grappling with broader political concerns related to Germany’s stance on Palestine, even as she acknowledged the support she has received from German audiences in the past. “Although I have been profoundly disturbed by the positions taken by the German government and various German cultural institutions on Palestine, I have always received political solidarity when I have spoken to German audiences about my views on the genocide in Gaza.This is what made it possible for me to think of attending the screening of Annie at the Berlinale.”Her decision not to attend, she said, followed remarks made by members of the Berlinale jury earlier on Thursday. “This morning, like millions of people across the world, I heard the unconscionable statements made by members of the jury of the Berlin film festival when they were asked to comment about the genocide in Gaza. To hear them say that art should not be political is jaw-dropping. It is a way of shutting down a conversation about a crime against humanity even as it unfolds before us in real time—when artists, writers and filmmakers should be doing everything in their power to stop it. ”Roy went on to state her position unequivocally: “Let me say this clearly: what has happened in Gaza, what continues to happen, is a genocide of the Palestinian people...""She also criticized prominent cultural figures for what she sees as their silence. “If the greatest filmmakers and artists of our time cannot stand up and say so, they should know that history will judge them. I am shocked and disgusted.”Concluding her statement, Roy announced her withdrawal from the event: “With deep regret, I must say that I will not be attending the Berlinale.”","Author Arundhati Roy has announced that she will not attend the Berlin International Film Festival (Berlinale) A film she wrote nearly four decades ago is scheduled to be screened in the festival’s Classics section.

In several locations, protests also took place outside the homes of Congress leaders.In Hoshiarpur, Deputy Speaker of the Punjab Assembly Jai Krishan Singh Rouri, along with some party MLAs, were among those present at the protest.The ruling party even arranged for a wedding band to play during the demonstrations as a symbolic protest against Bajwa's alleged derogatory remarks.Addressing the gathering in Hoshiarpur, AAP leaders described Bajwa's comments as ""unfortunate and unacceptable,"" demanding an apology from him. They stated that they would continue to oppose him on this issue during the upcoming Budget session of the Punjab Assembly.Bajwa had accused Minister Harbhajan Singh of corruption and stated that the Congress would hold him accountable once they form the government.""Jehra pehle band vajaanda reha, ehda band asin vajaavange (He who used to be a band player will be taken to task by us), Bajwa had said, referring to Singh.In response, Harbhajan Singh criticised Bajwa, asserting that mocking honest, hard-earned livelihoods was shameful. He noted that his father was a bandmaster who educated his children through hard work.Punjab State Scheduled Castes Commission chairman Jasvir Singh Garhi had taken suo motu notice of Bajwa's remark. Bajwa's counsel had said on Wednesday that the leader of the opposition (LoP) in the Punjab Assembly did not make any objectionable remarks against Harbhajan Singh.Bajwa's denial came through his counsel Arvind Kumar Sachdeva, who appeared before the chairman of the Punjab State Scheduled Castes Commission in a case of his alleged objectionable remarks against Harbhajan Singh.Meanwhile, speaking to reporters during the protest in Hoshiarpur, Rouri said such language did not suit the LoP. ""In a democratic system, it is not appropriate to make comments on someone's background or profession. Such language has no place in Punjab,"" he said.Rouri added that Bajwa's remarks had hurt the sentiments of working-class individuals. He highlighted that Harbhajan Singh comes from a humble background and has achieved success through hard work, emphasising that disrespecting any profession goes against Punjab's culture.""The band is traditionally associated with celebrations and the dignity of labour. Targeting someone for such work reflects a narrow mindset,"" he said.Rouri further stated that political opposition should be based on issues and policies rather than personal or derogatory references.In Ludhiana, AAP protested outside the office of Punjab Congress chief Amrinder Singh Raja Warring, with Minister Hardeep Singh Mundian leading the demonstration. Mundian condemned the language used by Congress leaders.AAP demonstrators also staged protests in other areas, including Sri Muktsar Sahib, Moga, Bathinda, Amritsar, and Jalandhar, further highlighting their discontent.","Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) staged protests across Punjab on Friday.

The 'political bomb'

NEW DELHI: Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) chief and actor Vijay delivered a high-voltage campaign speech in Salem on Friday, while training his fire on two pressure points — the DMK government’s Rs 2,000 cash payout to women and what he called his own ""political bomb"" that has unsettled chief minister MK Stalin.Addressing a cheering crowd, Vijay took aim at the the DMK government's cash transfer scheme for women, under which Rs 3,000 was released as an advance, with a promise of an additional Rs 2,000 later. He alleged the move was designed to influence voters and framed the contest in stark moral terms. ""Will you vote for 'good' TVK or 'evil' DMK?"" he asked, urging people to ""take the money, but blow the whistle,"" a reference to his party’s election symbol.""My vote is my right. No one can buy us. Our vote is for whistle,"" he said.Questioning the timing of what he described as a ""summer bonanza,"" Vijay said, ""Does summer come only this year? This special allowance was announced because the sound of the whistle is being heard in every street and every home."" He claimed Stalin was unsettled by the growing popularity of TVK, particularly among women voters.Pushing back against criticism that he lacked administrative experience, the actor leaned into the charge.""We have no experience in looting,"" he quipped.The speech also came amid fresh political messaging from Vijay on alliances. He claimed his earlier promise of sharing power with allies had become a ""political bomb"" in Tamil Nadu. ""Do you remember my political bomb at the Vikravandi rally; offering to share power? It is now exploding recklessly in all the alliances, CM Stalin sir is rattled and he says that power sharing will not suit Tamil Nadu,"" he said.For the DMK, the alliance is only to win and for all other things, such as governance, they will be on their own, Vijay asserted.Stalin on Wednesday had ruled out the possibility of a coalition government in the state, a suggestion being voiced by Congress netas ahead of the upcoming assembly polls.""Sharing power will not suit Tamil Nadu,"" the CM had said. ""Both Congress and DMK are aware that power-sharing will not work in Tamil Nadu. But some are trying to create a divide between the two parties,"" he said.The CM, however, said DMK’s alliance would continue with Congress. “Some are trying to break the alliance, but it will not happen. We will face the elections together.”The statement renewed strain in the DMK-Congress alliance with Congress MP Manickam Tagore publicly pushing back against Stalin after he dismissed the power-sharing demands as a ""conspiracy"". Tagore, one of the most vocal proponents of a share in governance for Congress, questioned Stalin’s remarks in one-line post on X: ""How is it that seeking, in a spirit of friendship, a role (a share) in work to serve the people could be termed as conspiracy?"" The pointed response, accompanied by a thinking-face emoji, suggested that at least a section of the party is unwilling to soften its stand even after the DMK chief drew a clear red line.","Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) chief and actor Vijay delivered a high-voltage campaign speech in Salem.

"Ladakh: Centre rejects Sixth Schedule, statehood for Ladakh, offers council",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-rejects-sixth-schedule-statehood-for-ladakh-offers-council/articleshow/128273026.cms,"JAMMU: The Centre has made it clear that Ladakh will not be granted Sixth Schedule status or statehood, two key demands of Leh Apex Body (LAB) and Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA), the region’s two major political organisations said after talks in New Delhi last week.The Sixth Schedule of the Constitution allows special administrative arrangements for tribal areas to safeguard autonomy, culture and land. Speaking publicly for the first time after the Feb 4 talks with a Union home ministry (MHA) high-powered committee, Ladakh leaders said the Centre had instead offered a “territorial council” model.Under this proposal, chief executive councillor of Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDC) will be designated as CM and the deputy chief executive councillor as deputy CM.“We call it a farce. LAB and KDA rejected it (the offer), except for one KDA member, Kunzes Dolma,” KDA co-chairman Asgar Ali Karbali said at a gathering in Kargil on Wednesday.According to Karbali, Dolma had earlier supported KDA’s agenda and was nominated as a member for the talks. “She told the high-powered committee that a conspiracy was hatched to remove her and that she is satisfied with the Union Territory status for Ladakh.We will not tolerate anyone, whether Dolma or anyone else, who plays with Ladakhi identity,” Karbali said.As Karbali spoke, many in the Kargil gathering raised slogans against Dolma and chanted support for Sonam Wangchuk, LAB member and climate activist jailed over violence in Sept 2025 during statehood protests in Leh.After the talks negotiations with the MHA committee headed by junior Union home minister Home Nityanand Rai, Karbali and Ladakh Buddhist Association (LBA) president Tsering Dorje Lakrook had described the talks as inconclusive.“When we reiterated Sixth Schedule status and statehood, they (MHA officials) argued that the Sixth Schedule has become ‘defunct’ and largely powerless. We disagreed. Supreme Court has repeatedly held Sixth Schedule as a law in itself and a strong constitutional safeguard. If it is powerful in the Northeastern states, why is it suddenly being called weak for Ladakh?” Karbali said.On statehood, Karbali said the MHA’s main objection was that Ladakh lacks sufficient financial resources. “When we asked that our legal experts be allowed to explain this, we were told they could not be called into the meeting. There is no Indian state that has every resource within its own territory,” Karbali argued.He reiterated the LAB and the KDA remain united in pressing for Sixth Schedule status and statehood as their core demands.","The Centre has made it clear that Ladakh will not be granted Sixth Schedule status or statehood, the region’s two major political organisations said after talks in New Delhi last week.

Extortion threats are prompting families in Peel Region to leave Canada as the police departments are still trying to get a better handle on these cases as they cross provincial and international borders, Toronto City News reported.Dharmjit, an Indian-origin man, who became the target of the extortion gang late last year, said the police do not have enough resources to fight the criminals. Dharmjit said he started receiving extortion calls in October 2025. He informed the police blocked all the numbers. But the extortion calls never stopped coming. And then there was a firing at his farm on November 25. Dharmjit said the cops advised them to stay away from that residence. They did that. But when they returned, the gunfire too returned.“So if the police cannot protect you, the police have nothing to protect you. So what do you do? They say, leave from your house, leave your house. Where do you go? Why do you want to buy another house in the same area or the same country? Better leave the country,” Dharmjit said.“They start in October, calling me about money. Then I informed the police. So I blocked the number, then they started calling from another number, and I blocked this number.Then they come on November 25th at my farm, they shoot, at night,” he said.Extortion targeting Indians has become a normal thing in Canada, with local government calling on the federal government for help in fighting this organized crime.

Candace Drops 'SECRET' TPUSA Tape: Erika Kirk Heard Laughing Days After Charlie Kirk’s Killing

Candace Owens under fire after interview details complicate grooming allegation





A social media clash between commentator Candace Owens and critics escalated this week after a viral post accused her of stretching the meaning of serious allegations for effect. The flashpoint centers on claims that Owens suggested someone was “grooming” a 15 year old, only for details from her own interview to complicate that narrative.The backlash gathered pace when a verified user, Natly Denise, challenged Owens’ framing and questioned whether the term itself was being misused. The dispute has since spilled across platforms, pulling in past controversies and reigniting debate over how powerful words are deployed in public discourse.Natly Denise wrote: “So Candace and her little Cantifa podcast circle float this grotesque angle that Erika was ‘grooming’ a 15-year-old. Then Candace interviews the girl herself… and confirms they only hung out once. So does Candace even know what ‘grooming’ means, or is she just stretching words like cheap elastic until they snap?She further added, ""She’s already twisted the definition of human trafficking to protect Tate, and now she’s warping the meaning of grooming just to smear Erika.Absolutely vile.”Owens, for her part, described the relationship differently during her show. She said: “And curiously, get this, she tells me that she and Erica actually never hung out in person beyond that first meeting. So this was purely meant to be an electronic, a platonic relationship where Erica said stuff even like this to her on Instagram, Jillian, that dime piece beside the car though, she's referring to Jillian just so you, just so we're clear, she's referring to Jillian beside a car. ”The fundamental conflict is based on the definition and purpose. The word limited contact, according to critics, runs the danger of watering down a word that is commonly linked with continuous manipulation. Even though there is no repeat face-to-face interaction, supporters argue that online interactions could also be something to worry about.More than a single exchange is involved. Such terms as grooming and trafficking have a legal and moral connotation. Whenever they emerge in political commentary, listeners pay attention. The dispute has become a wider cultural clash about the way prejudices are put across and the way words are used to make people think.",A viral post has intensified debate over Candace Owens’ use of the term grooming.

NEW DELHI: Nikhil Gupta, an Indian man accused of murder plot of Khalistani terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, has pled guilty in a US court.Nikhil Gupta (54) pleaded guilty on Friday to charges of murder-for-hire, conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire and conspiracy to commit money laundering before a Manhattan court, news agency Reuters reported. The charges together carry a maximum sentence of up to 40 years in prison, officials said.Gupta, who has been lodged in a Brooklyn jail since his extradition to the United States in June last year, entered the plea before US magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn. He had earlier pleaded not guilty after being extradited from the Czech Republic, where he was arrested in 2023.Gupta is accused of hiring a hitman for $100,000 to assassinate Pannun, a dual US-Canadian citizen, allegedly at the behest of an Indian government official identified by US authorities as Vikash Yadav. The plot collapsed after the purported hitman turned out to be an undercover federal agent.According to the US Department of Justice, Yadav allegedly roped in Gupta in May 2023 to coordinate the plan to kill Pannun in New York.The government also constituted a high-level committee in November 2023 to examine the US allegations. In January last year, just days before Donald Trump assumed office, the panel submitted its report recommending legal action against the official concerned, without naming him. The report said the individual's ""earlier criminal links and antecedents"" had also surfaced during the enquiry.","Nikhil Gupta, an Indian man accused of murder plot of Khalistani terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, has pled guilty in a US court.

Bangladeshi migrant avoids deportation from UK over 20-year jail sentence imposed under Sheikh Hasina’s regime in Dhaka,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/bangladeshi-migrant-avoids-deportation-from-uk-over-20-year-jail-sentence-imposed-under-sheikh-hasinas-regime-in-dhaka/articleshow/128273210.cms,"Protest Held Outside UK Parliament Demanding Labour Govt To Press Bangladesh Over Hindu Persecution





A Bangladeshi migrant has won the right to remain in Britain after a court ruled that he cannot be deported because he would face a 20-year prison sentence on explosives charges if he returned home.The man, referred to in court as MM, was granted asylum after successfully arguing that the charges against him in Bangladesh were false and politically motivated. He said he had been targeted by the previous Awami League government because of his links to an opposing political group, reports the Daily Mail.The Home Office accepted that the bomb charges were probably bogus but said that he could safely return because the political situation in Bangladesh had changed. However, the Upper Tribunal ruled in his favour.MM told the tribunal that he was a “political leader” of Islami Chhatra Shibir, the student wing of the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami party. He said the Awami League had brought false criminal charges against him in 2015 while he was in Cyprus.He provided court documents showing that he had been convicted in his absence and sentenced to 20 years in prison. The documents were verified as genuine.Seven other men, including Ahsan Habib, Mostafa Kamal, Mehedi Hasan, Rabiul Islam, Monowar Hossain, Jamirul Islam and Moynul Islam, were previously convicted and given the same sentence.Upper Tribunal Judge Madeleine Reeds said: “[It was] confirmed that the [migrant's] case relied upon the preserved finding that there were genuinely issued court documents demonstrating that he had been convicted and sentenced to 20 years imprisonment and that there were two further outstanding arrest warrants and the question was what risk the [he] faced on return in light of having been convicted in absentia and considering the country information. ""They added: “He submitted that the Home Office's approach to the case was difficult to follow in light of the preserved finding that the documents were genuinely issued documents from the court that were politically motivated and false rather than based on any criminal conduct.""Also: “Those documents having been found to be genuine, is therefore determinative of the appeal in MM's favour.”The Home Office argued that the removal of Sheikh Hasina and the Awami League from power in August 2024 meant MM would no longer be at risk. After months of student-led protests that turned into a nationwide uprising, Hasina resigned and fled to India. A United Nations report said up to 1,400 people were killed during the unrest, most shot by security forces.Judge Reeds said the Awami League had not been fully removed from power and still had supporters inside government offices and law enforcement. She referred to reports saying the country remains unstable and that some innocent people have been arrested while authorities review cases believed to be politically motivated.She concluded: “I therefore conclude that there is a reasonable likelihood on these particular facts of the [migrant] being detained for what both parties accept are politically motivated charges and conviction and which are not legitimate and do not reflect any wrongdoing by [him].""And added: “Whilst they relate to events from the previous regime, the conviction remains and the sentence is a long one and on the evidence as it stands, there is a real risk that he will not be released on bail.”The tribunal allowed his appeal, meaning he will remain in UK.", Bangladeshi migrant has won the right to remain in Britain.

MANGALURU: The headmaster (in-charge) of a government higher primary school in Balenja village of Belthangady taluk was placed under suspension on Thursday, for allegedly making nearly 70 students travel in two goods vehicles during a recent field study visit.Tarakesari, block education officer (BEO), Belthangady, said that Kiran Kumar KS of the Government Upgraded Higher Primary School, Balenja, was suspended by the Dakshina Kannada deputy director of public instruction (DDPI).The incident, which occurred on Feb 9, triggered sharp criticism for violating student safety norms and transport guidelines. According to the BEO, the trip was organised as part of Eco Club activities to a beekeeping farm located near the school.Instead of arranging proper transport facilities, the headmaster allegedly used a tipper truck and a pickup vehicle to ferry the children to the site and back. Videos showing students being transported in unsafe conditions circulated widely on social media, prompting swift action by the education department.The BEO's office also received an oral complaint from parents. Following the complaint and the viral footage, a team of officials, including the BEO, sought an explanation from the headmaster, and held discussions with parents to ascertain the details of the incident.DDPI GS Shashidhar said the suspension order was issued based on the video evidence and information available to the department. He stated that schools must use passenger vehicles with valid documentation and ensure required safety compliance when transporting children. The suspension order was issued under the Karnataka Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 2021, and the Karnataka State Child Protection Policy. ""Parents send their children to school trusting teachers, and we should not break that trust,"" Shashidhar said, adding that the episode serves as a reminder that student safety cannot be compromised under any circumstances. The school caters to students from classes I to VIII.Meanwhile, based on a complaint filed by Dharanendra of Balanja village in Belthangady taluk, a case has been registered at the Venoor Police Station under Section 281 of the BNS and Sections 66 and 192(A) of the IMV Act.

Student expelled after calling for probe into Hong Kong’s deadliest fire that claimed 168 lives,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/student-expelled-after-calling-for-probe-into-hong-kongs-deadliest-fire-that-claimed-168-lives/articleshow/128335400.cms,"



Months after a deadly fire engulfed the Wang Fuk Court residential towers in Hong Kong, the questions surrounding accountability for the tragedy have shifted focus. A university student has been expelled by the Chinese University of Hong Kong, or CUHK, for raising the question of accountability for the tragic incident that claimed 168 lives in November 2025.In the aftermath of the fire, Miles Kwan, a 24-year-old student, joined others in launching a petition calling for an independent investigation into the incident.The petition sought a review of safety certifications, scrutiny of alleged lapses in construction oversight, and accountability for officials following reports that concerns had been raised about flammable scaffolding netting before the fire.Authorities detained Kwan on allegations of “seditious intent,” citing his distribution of flyers that called for government accountability in ensuring public safety, The Guardian reported.According to the university, the decision followed what it described as “multiple acts of misconduct,” including his conduct during disciplinary proceedings. Kwan had completed his academic requirements and was weeks away from graduating in March.He received demerits for calling the committee a “kangaroo panel” and a “disgrace,” as well as for a 2023 charge of “criminal damage” linked to placing stickers on lamp-posts in 2022 to mark the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown.According to CUHK, a student who gets three demerits due to disciplnary act gets expelled from studying at the institute.In a statement following the decision, Kwan said, “You can take away qualifications, but you can’t take away dignity.”The controversy widened this week, and the case drew attention from rights groups and student organisations, who argued that the demands centred on public safety and transparency.CUHK has not publicly linked its decision to Kwan’s activism related to the fire, but the move has prompted debate among students and academics about academic freedom and the boundaries of political expression on campus.Authorities have since established a judge-led committee to investigate the causes of the Wang Fuk Court fire. Officials say the inquiry will examine safety procedures and responsibility for the incident, though critics have questioned whether the process will be sufficiently independent.Families of the victims continue to seek answers as the investigation proceeds. The case has also intensified broader discussions in the city about public safety, accountability, and the limits of dissent in the aftermath of major tragedies.","Miles Kwan, a 24-year-old student, has been expelled by the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

Concerns have deepened after Friday’s Bangladesh poll results showed hardliner Jamaat-e-Islami and its allies winning many of their 68 seats in areas bordering India. The total tally is Jamaat’s highest in over 25 years.Jamaat’s historical and ideological proximity with Pakistan raises the risks for India, a peril flagged by BJP. The saffron party had bagged in 2021 more than 16 Bengal assembly constituencies that share borders with the areas of Bangladesh where Jamaat has made inroads. “Bangladesh is a different country. We expect the newly formed govt to maintain law and order and ensure minorities will not be persecuted. But Jamaat’s victory along the border is worrying. It clearly shows there has been strong radicalisation on both sides of the border,” Union minister Sukanta Majumdar of BJP said.South 24 Parganas, North 24 Parganas, Nadia, Murshidabad, Malda and Alipurduar are among the Bengal districts that share borders with Bangladesh zones where Jamaat has come up trumps. Broadly, Jamaat has put its footprint on much of western Bangladesh, including Satkhira, Mymensingh, Rajshahi, Rangpur and Gaibandha.Functionaries of exiled former PM Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League indicated that Jamaat, banned earlier, started spreading its influence over the past year. “Jamaat is a radical outfit which believes in hardlines which was never acceptable to democratic parties like Awami League. Unfortunately, they spread their organisation during the tenure of the interim govt,” said Salim Mahmud, former Awami League MP of Chandpur (1).In the 2001 election, Jamaat won 17 seats. In 2008, it was reduced to two. In 2013, Jamaat’s registration was cancelled by Bangladesh’s Supreme Court. While Hasina banned Jamaat, the interim govt lifted it in 2024.",Jamaat-e-Islami and its allies won many of their 68 seats in areas bordering India.

Protests despite restrictions

Why the monarchy issue has resurfaced

Political backdrop and upcoming elections





Thousands of supporters of Nepal’s former king gathered outside Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport on Friday, demanding the restoration of the monarchy that was abolished nearly two decades ago.Gyanendra Shah waved to cheering crowds from the sunroof of his car as hundreds of police officers in riot gear tried to manage supporters at the airport’s main entrance. The former king was returning from a trip to eastern Nepal.“Bring back the king. We love our king more than our own selves. Restore constitutional monarchy,” the crowd chanted.More supporters lined the route from the airport to his private residence. The gatherings remained peaceful and no arrests were reported.Pro-monarchy demonstrators shouting “King, come and save the country"" offered bouquets of flowers and waved the national flag as Gyanendra arrived at his home after a three-month holiday in Nepal’s east.“We must restore the monarchy because the king can be a caring guardian of all Nepali people, something many corrupt political leaders have failed to do,” said Sanatan Prasad Regmi, 55, a Gyanendra supporter.“We have no use for a republic.”The rally took place despite prohibitory orders issued by the Kathmandu District Administration Office, which had banned gatherings of more than five people in and around the airport area.Security presence was heavy across the airport perimeter to prevent any escalation.Cadres of the pro-monarchist Rastriya Prajatantra Party, led by senior leader Kamal Thapa, were present at the site. They were joined by loyalist groups led by Navaraj Subedi and medical professional Durga Prasai, who had gathered in the airport area since Friday morning.Nepal abolished the monarchy in 2008 after massive street protests in 2006 forced Gyanendra to give up his authoritarian rule. Parliament later voted to formally end the monarchy, and he left the Royal Palace to live as a commoner in Kathmandu.However, pro-monarchy demonstrations resurfaced last year amid economic distress and continuing political instability. Nepal has seen 14 changes of government in the past 18 years, a pattern that has unsettled investors and slowed economic growth.Many Nepalis have expressed frustration with the republican system, accusing it of failing to deliver on promises of development and job creation.The renewed demonstrations come months after the September 8 protests led by Gen Z youth activists, which were sparked by growing frustration over corruption, lack of accountability and the perceived failure of political elites, following the Nepalese government’s ban on social media.The unrest led to the resignation of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. Sushila Karki, Nepal’s first woman Chief Justice, was sworn in as interim Prime Minister.Karki, 73, will hold the position until the first week of March, when elections are scheduled to choose a new executive head.The movement, referred to as the Gen Z revolution, resulted in 74 deaths when police used lethal force to suppress protests against the government of K.P. Sharma Oli, who is currently in hiding.The show of royalist support also comes ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for March 5.A total of 65 parties are contesting 275 seats in the assembly. Nearly 19 million of Nepal’s 30 million people are eligible to vote, including nearly one million new voters, mostly youths, added after recent protests.Pro-Gyanendra groups, which secured about 5% of seats in the last election, are hoping to increase their representation.During a press meet in Kathmandu on Thursday, Durga Prasai said they want to restore the institution of monarchy before the March 5 general election. He claimed that the election cannot be held without addressing their agenda of reinstalling a Hindu monarch in the country.Despite visible support from royalist groups, Gyanendra’s chances of an immediate return to power remain limited, as broader political backing remains with parties opposed to restoring the monarchy.",Gyanendra Shah waved to cheering crowds from the sunroof of his car as hundreds of police officers in riot gear tried to manage supporters at the airport’s main entrance.

Kathy Ruemmler: Top Goldman Sachs lawyer Kathryn Ruemmler resigns over Epstein links — details of exchange emerge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/uncle-jeffrey-top-goldman-sachs-lawyer-kathryn-ruemmler-resigns-over-epstein-links-details-of-exchange-emerge/articleshow/128286821.cms,"Newly Released Epstein Videos Suggest Victims Were Forced Into Disturbing 'Auditions'

Ruemmler's ties to Epstein

Emails detail advice, personal exchanges and years-long ties





Kathryn Ruemmler, chief legal officer at Goldman Sachs and one of the highest paid lawyers in the US, resigned on Thursday night after the justice department released emails and other documents detailing her extensive relationship with infamous financier and convicted sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein For years, Ruemmler and the financial services firm had maintained that her contact with Epstein was strictly professional. However, emails, text messages and photographs released to the public last month presented a completely different picture, indicating that the lawyer had been closer to him even before she joined Goldman in 2020.Goldman’s chief executive David M Solomon said in a statement that he had accepted her resignation, “and I respect her decision.”Ruemmler had been general counsel since 2021 and also served as a partner and vice chair of the bank’s reputational risk committee. Earlier, she worked as White House counsel under Barack Obama and later as a white-collar defence lawyer at Latham & Watkins.“My responsibility is to put Goldman Sachs' interests first,” Ruemmler said.Goldman had defended her in recent weeks, saying that her links with Epstein happened before she was hired and were appropriate.However, the Justice Department’s latest release, more than 10,000 documents mentioning her, showed a relationship that stretched over many years.The records showed Ruemmler acting as a counsellor, confidant and friend to Epstein. She advised him on how to answer difficult questions about his sex crimes, spoke about her own dating life, discussed ways to avoid negative media coverage and called him “sweetie” and “Uncle Jeffrey”.According to The Guardian, an email “So lovely and thoughtful! Thank you to Uncle Jeffrey!!!” Ruemmler wrote to Epstein in 2018.In return, Epstein offered career guidance about her move to Goldman, introduced her to prominent businesspeople and gave her gifts including spa treatments, luxury goods and high-end travel. Furthermore, within the hundreds of messages examined by CNN about Epstein’s legal troubles and damage to his reputation, there were also more intimate notes between the pair, including talk of a potential trip to his island and references to presents he had given her.From 2014, Kathryn began what she described in one email as a “friendship”. She explained Epstein how the law distinguishes between underage victims of sex crimes and adult prostitutes. “I think the point is that if she was underage, she could not legally consent to engaging in prostitution,” Ruemmler wrote to Epstein in 2015.She also advised the disgraced financer on how to challenge the credibility of an accuser, saying in one message that his lawyer could push the woman into a “perjury trap.”Back in 2015, on Epstein’s 62nd birthday, Ruemmler sent him an email, writing, “I hope you enjoy the day with your one true love. :-)”. Some emails ended with “xoxo”, and the two exchanged photographs. In other conversations, she joked about the weight of visitors at New Jersey rest stops and speculated about the sexual orientation of a well-known hedge fund billionaire, according to the New York Times.Ruemmler, over a series of meetings, also asked for Epstein’s views on personal and professional issues, including her dating concerns. “men aren't interested in women my age,” one email said.Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs and Ruemmler have maintained that Epstein was never her client. Yet in 2018, when she helped him edit a legal document defending his 2008 plea deal for soliciting prostitution from a minor, the emails between them carried the subject line, “Attorney Client.”","Kathryn Ruemmler, chief legal officer at Goldman Sachs and one of the highest paid lawyers in the US, resigned on Thursday night.

'We Don't Belong To Trump': Venezuela Rises Against 'Colonial' US: Caracas Erupts For Maduro Return





US President Donald Trump said on Friday that ties between the United States and Venezuela are “very good” and announced plans to visit the country.""I'm going to make a visit to Venezuela,"" Trump said, mentioning that the date has not been fixed yet.“We have a very good relationship with the president of Venezuela,” he said.He added that Washington is “working together very closely” with Venezuela's interim leader Delcy Rodriguez on access to oil, noting that he had officially recognised the government.“The relationship we have right now with Venezuela I would say is a 10,” he said, as cited by Reuters.In recent weeks, Trump administration officials had indicated that Washington did not recognise Rodriguez’s interim government as legitimate.Trump’s comments came after a visit to Caracas earlier this week by the US energy secretary and as his administration eased additional sanctions that had blocked investment in Venezuela’s oil sector.On Friday, the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued general licences to BP, Chevron, Eni, Repsol and Shell, authorising certain transactions related to oil and gas operations in the country under specific conditions.“These general licenses invite American and other aligned companies to play a constructive role in supporting economic recovery and responsible investment,” a Trump administration media note said, describing the OFAC move as part of Trump’s commitment to “rapidly” reopen the oil industry.""The United States is committed to restoring Venezuela's prosperity, safety, and security for the benefit of both the American and Venezuelan people,"" the note added, as cited by AFP.Trump and senior officials, including Energy Secretary Chris Wright, have openly suggested that Washington would play a dominant role in managing Venezuela’s oil resources for the foreseeable future.The global oil industry has also expressed interest in returning to the petroleum-rich country but has warned that major investments would depend on clear and stable rules, following past expropriations under earlier governments.Meanwhile, the US State Department said on Friday it had sent more than six tonnes of medical supplies to Venezuela to help stabilise the country.Venezuela produced about 1.2 million barrels of oil per day in 2025, up from a historic low of roughly 360,000 barrels per day in 2020. It is still far below the 3 million barrels per day it pumped 25 years ago.",US President Donald Trump said on Friday that ties between the United States and Venezuela are “very good” and announced plans to visit the country.

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has finally explained the real reason he called Donald Trump “Daddy” — and says it’s not what many people think.In an interview with Politico, Rutte insisted the remark was “never intentional,” attributing it — in otherwise fluent English — to what he called his “insufficient command of the English language,” while firmly dismissing any suggestion of personal subtext.Describing Trump as a “fun guy” with “a lot of humor,” Rutte acknowledged that the nickname has since taken on a life of its own, adding with a shrug: “I’m living with it.”""We had the NATO summit in Iraq and Donald Trump, the president, and I had a meeting before, and it was a press play. And that was exactly on the morning after the day where he took out the nuclear facilities in Iran. And I was very happy with that. And I complimented him with doing that through the B2s. And it was when he was also having some arguments with the Israelis. And then I said, and here is my insufficient command of the English language,"" Rutte said.""I said, yeah, Daddy sometimes has to be tough. And of course, later realizing that the word daddy has a lot of connotations, then what he did, and this is to his credit, because he is a fun guy and he has a lot of humor. The American side then put this on T shirts. There was a video when he came back from the D.Hague summit where he said, daddy is home. So there it was born and it was never intentioned. But again, I'm now carrying it, living with it. It's a fact. Now he's Daddy. I think you could take some ownership of Daddy just a little bit. Okay, I'll take that advice,"" he added.Trump, in the past, had repeatedly said that Rutte called him ""Daddy.""At the Davos speech, Trump said, ""Until the last few days, when I told them about Iceland, they loved me,"" he said.""They called me daddy, right, the last time.""Factually, Last year, Rutte did called him ""Daddy.""","NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has finally explained the real reason he called Donald Trump “Daddy” Rutte acknowledged that the nickname has since taken on a life of its own, adding with a shrug: “I’m living with it.”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128323338,imgsize-44738,width-400,resizemode-4/62nd-munich-security-conference.jpg"

Trump administration ends deportation protections for Yemenis in US — what is TPS and what happens after termination?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-administration-ends-deportation-protections-for-yemenis-in-us-what-is-tps-and-what-happens-after-termination/articleshow/128318327.cms,"Kristi Noem Admits DHS “Messed Up” in ICE Operations Amid Impeachment Threat? | WATCH

What is TPS?

What happens when TPS ends?

What can you do next?





The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on Friday moved to end deportation protections for people from Yemen, the 13th country from which the Trump administration struck the status.The move left just 4 countries that the administration did not seek to end what is known as Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which bars immigration agencies from deporting nationals back to countries experiencing a natural disaster or civil unrest.Roughly 1,400 Yemenis currently in the US are protected from deportation under TPS.“After reviewing conditions in the country and consulting with appropriate US govt agencies, I determined that Yemen no longer meets the law’s requirements to be designated for Temporary Protected Status,” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in a release.“Allowing TPS Yemen beneficiaries to remain temporarily in the United States is contrary to our national interest,” she added. “TPS was designed to be temporary, and this administration is returning TPS to its original temporary intent. We are prioritising our national security interests and putting America first.”Yemeni citizens were continually protected under TPS since 2015.When Noem’s predecessor, former Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, redesignated Yemen for the protection, he wrote that the country was on “the brink of economic collapse”.“Yemen was in a state of protracted conflict for the past decade, severely limiting civilians’ access to water, food, and medical care, pushing the country to the brink of economic collapse, and preventing Yemeni nationals living abroad from safely returning home,” he wrote in the 2024 designation.DHS continually faced roadblocks in court as it tried to lift TPS, though those rulings were not always helpful to the recipients, who in some cases were still forced to leave the country as litigation continued.The Secretary of Homeland Security may designate a foreign country for TPS due to conditions in the country that temporarily prevent the country's nationals from returning safely, or in certain circumstances, where the country is unable to handle the return of its nationals adequately. USCIS may grant TPS to eligible nationals of certain countries (or parts of countries), who are already in the United States. Eligible individuals without nationality who last resided in the designated country may also be granted TPS, USIC.gov reported.When the U.S. government terminates TPS for a country, beneficiaries are required to either adjust to another legal status or prepare to leave the US, a legal group said.This process can involve:Receiving an official notice from USCIS.Having a deadline to leave the U.S. or apply for another form of relief.Potentially facing detention or removal proceedings if no alternative status is obtained.Even if your TPS has ended, you may still have options to remain in the U.S.:Apply for asylum: If you fear persecution in your home country due to race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group.Apply for U or T Visas: These visas are available for victims of certain crimes (U Visa) or human trafficking (T Visa).Family-based immigration: You may be eligible to stay in the U.S. through family sponsorship by a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident.Be sure to keep copies of all notices from USCIS or DHS and act quickly to protect your status.","Yemen is the 13th country from which the Trump administration struck the status.

The Supreme Court of Pakistan on Thursday directed authorities to constitute a medical board to assess the health of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan after reports surfaced about a loss of vision in one of his eyes.A bench comprising Chief Justice Yahya Afridi and Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan also instructed officials to facilitate communication between Khan and his two sons, who live in the United Kingdom with his former wife, British producer and screenwriter Jemima Goldsmith.“The issue of Imran’s health is most important. Intervention is necessary. His phone calls with his son are also important,” Chief Justice Afridi said during the hearing.The order came after the bench resumed hearing a case about the jail conditions of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder-president and ordered a detailed medical check-up before February 16. During the hearing, Attorney General Mansoor Usman Awan said it was the state’s responsibility to provide the former prime minister with medical care.The order also came two days after the court asked PTI leader and lawyer Salman Safdar to meet Khan at Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, where the cricketer-turned-politician has been held since August 5, 2023, following his conviction in a corruption case.Safdar later submitted his report to the court after meeting Khan. It was the first meeting with the jailed leader since December 2, when his sister, Uzma Khan, was allowed to see him for 20 minutes.Meanwhile, Dawn newspaper, citing the report, noted that it detailed Safdar’s meeting with Khan, the condition of his cell, the facilities provided to him, a description of his living area and the process the lawyer followed to reach the jail.In the report, Safdar quoted Khan as stating that despite receiving treatment, including an injection, he has only 15% vision left in his right eye.Khan reportedly told Safdar that until October 2025, he had normal vision in both eyes. He later began experiencing constant blurred and hazy vision, which he repeatedly reported to the then jail superintendent, but no action was taken.The report added that Khan eventually suffered a sudden and complete loss of vision in his right eye. An eye specialist from Pims Hospital, Dr Muhammad Arif, was then called to examine him.He was diagnosed with a blood clot that caused serious damage. Despite treatment, including an injection, his vision in the right eye remains at only 15 per cent.A day earlier, Safdar denied making any statement about Khan’s health on Tuesday, clarifying that anything attributed to him on the matter had been misrepresented or misreported.However, on the day he met Khan, Safdar told reporters that the jailed leader was “fine and healthy.”","Supreme Court of Pakistan orders medical board to assess Imran Khan's health.

Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif has delivered a scathing assessment of his country’s past alliances with Washington, telling the National Assembly that Islamabad had been “used like toilet paper and then discarded” after serving American interests in Afghanistan.Speaking during a debate on terrorism following a deadly suicide bombing at a Shia mosque in Islamabad, Asif said Pakistan had repeatedly joined “superpower wars” that were never its own.“We took part in two wars that were fought on the soil of Afghanistan,” Asif told lawmakers. Referring to the Soviet intervention in 1979, he claimed it was carried out “at the invitation of the government in Kabul” and that the narrative of an outright invasion was shaped by the United States.Pakistan, he said, entered those conflicts “in the name of Islam and religion”, but in reality two former military dictators sought legitimacy and the backing of a global power.“These were not our wars; they were superpower wars,” he said, adding that Pakistan and its land were used and then discarded ""like toilet paper.""Asif went on to describe terrorism in Pakistan as the “blowback of mistakes committed by dictators in the past”.He added that Pakistan had failed to learn from history, continuing to shift between Washington, Moscow and London in pursuit of short-term interests.""For our own interests, we sometimes turn to Washington, sometimes to Moscow, and sometimes to Britain. We have built strong franchises here, which was not the case 30 or 40 years ago,"" Asif said.Recalling then US President Bill Clinton’s brief stop in Islamabad in 2000, a visit lasting only a few hours at the end of a longer India trip, Asif said it underscored how transactional the relationship had become. Clinton’s engagement with then military ruler Pervez Musharraf was framed by US demands on democracy, non-proliferation and militancy, reinforcing.Asif’s remarks came as parliament passed a resolution condemning the attack on Imambargah Qasr-e-Khadijatul Kubra in Islamabad’s Tarlai area, where a suicide bomber killed 31 people and wounded 169 during Friday prayers. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility. Thousands attended funerals across the capital as grieving families demanded accountability. “What happened yesterday has left us extremely angry and deeply hurt,” said Bushra Rahmani, whose brother was among the wounded.The minister urged political unity, lamenting what he called a lack of consensus even in condemning terrorism. “It is very important that we have a national identity on which no one disagrees,” he said, criticising those who, for political reasons, avoided attending the funerals of victims.","Defence minister Khawaja Asif criticises Pakistan's past alliances with the U.S. and Russia.

Pakistan’s Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Sunday launched a sharp attack on Pakistan’s handling of militancy and its Afghanistan policy, questioning how extremist elements continue to cross the border even as trade remains blocked.Speaking at a public gathering in Rawalpindi, Rehman highlighted what he described as a glaring contradiction in Islamabad’s approach towards Afghanistan. “In all these decades, we never paused to ask why our Afghan policy failed so miserably. Not a single pomegranate or melon can enter Pakistan, yet terrorists keep crossing the border,” he said, smiling as he made the remark.Referring to repeated claims by Pakistani authorities that militants were entering from Afghanistan, Rehman added, “Authorities say terrorists are coming from there. If they are coming, stop them. If they are coming, eliminate them. The Afghan government has never objected to your actions.”The JUI-F leader also criticised Pakistan’s broader foreign and economic policies, calling them “complete failures”. He said Islamabad’s diplomatic approach had left the country increasingly isolated.“India is our enemy, Afghanistan is our enemy, and even Iran and China are upset with us,” Rehman said, adding that the public deserved answers.“A nation cannot survive when its policies produce only isolation, mistrust and insecurity.”He argued that Pakistan’s foreign policy was being driven not by elected governments but by the military establishment. “One general comes and says we will negotiate; another comes and says we will wage war,” he said.Rehman also took aim at the government’s handling of the China-Pakistan economic corridor (CPEC), claiming that the flagship infrastructure project had stalled due to declining Chinese confidence.“CPEC has seen no real progress during this tenure because China no longer trusts us,” he said, questioning whether “even a single brick” had moved under the current government. He claimed Beijing had expected the Pakistan democratic movement (PDM) government to stabilise relations and revive projects, but remained dissatisfied.Rehman’s remarks come amid heightened tensions following a suicide bombing at a mosque in Islamabad on Friday that killed 69 people and injured more than 170, according to local media reports citing hospital officials. The blast occurred during Friday prayers at Imambargah Qasr-i-Khadijatul Kubra in the Tarlai area, Dawn reported.After Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif suggested on X that preliminary findings pointed to the attacker having travelled to and from Afghanistan, Kabul rejected the allegation. Afghanistan’s ministry of national defence termed the claim “irresponsible and baseless” and urged Pakistani authorities to take responsibility for internal security lapses, Afghan media outlet Ariana News reported.The Afghan ministry said similar accusations had been made in the past following attacks in Balochistan and other parts of Pakistan, without conclusive evidence.","Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman criticises Pakistan’s handling of militancy and its Afghanistan policy.

NEW DELHI: Global terror outfit Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the deadly blast at a Shia mosque in Islamabad that led to over three dozen casualties on Friday. Toll rose to 36 on Saturday after some critically injured people died in hospitals, said a PTI report.In a related development that has attracted the attention of Indian security establishment, the Islamic State in its latest al-Naba issue called on members of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) to defect and join the Islamic State in Khorasan Province.The claim regarding the blast was issued via IS central's mouthpiece, Amaq, stating the attack was a Fidayeen operation carried out by a soldier of the Islamic State in Pakistan Province (ISPP) -- active since 2019 -- inside the mosque compound. Amaq claimed over 200 casualties in contrast to the official Pak govt admission of 36 deaths and injuries to scores.The suicide bomber was identified by Amaq as Saifullah Ansari. His photograph taking the bayah (oath of allegiance) was also posted by the IS mouthpiece. The statement also mentioned that hundreds of Pakistani Shias had joined the pro-Iran 'Zaynabiyoun brigade' militia in Syria.The claim by Amaq followed an official denial by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which strongly rebutted any involvement in the incident.The blast, which occurred during prayers at the Khadijatul Kubra mosque in Tarlai area, was the deadliest in Islamabad since the 2008 Marriott hotel bombing.The explosion coincided with the visit of Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev to Pakistan. The attack is being seen as a result of growing sectarian tensions in the country.Earlier in Jan, ISKP had claimed responsibility for a blast in Bajaur district that killed a senior Lashkar commander named Najibullah.","Global terror outfit Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the deadly blast at a Shia mosque in Islamabad that led to over three dozen casualties on Friday.

'Home-Grown Ills': Islamabad Mosque Blast Triggers Blame Game As India Rejects Pakistan's Blame





The Islamic State on Saturday claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing at a Shiite mosque in Islamabad, which killed at least 36 people and injured many others.In a statement released through its Amaq News Agency, the Islamic State in Pakistan, an offshoot of Daesh, said the bomber opened fire at security guards when they tried to stop him at the entrance and then exploded inside among worshippers.The group also said Shiite Muslims in Pakistan were a target, claiming they provided recruits to militias fighting the Islamic State in Syria.The blast took place on Friday at the Khadijatul Kubra mosque-cum-shrine in the Tarlie area of the capital. The attacker, identified as 32-year-old Yasir from Peshawar, entered the mosque while worshippers were offering weekly prayers and detonated explosives.Authorities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province said they arrested four suspects, including three alleged facilitators and the mastermind, during intelligence-based raids in Peshawar and Nowshera.Investigators said an identity card recovered during the probe confirmed the attacker’s identity. Official records showed his permanent address in Abbas Colony on Charsadda Road in Peshawar.Officials also said the attacker had spent around five months in Afghanistan before the bombing, where he allegedly received training in weapons handling and suicide attacks.Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif had earlier claimed that India and Afghanistan were involved in the attack, without presenting any evidence.India had strongly rejected the allegations, saying, ""It is unfortunate that, instead of seriously addressing the problems plaguing its social fabric, Pakistan should choose to delude itself by blaming others for its home-grown ills. India rejects any and every such allegation, which is as baseless as it is pointless.""","The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing at a Shiite mosque in Islamabad.

Signals from Washington and Tehran





Pakistan has been invited to participate in upcoming talks between Iran and the United States aimed at easing tensions between the two countries, slated to take place on Friday in Turkey.“Pakistan has received the invitation for the upcoming talks between Iran and the United States,” Pakistan foreign office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said while responding to a query, reported Dawn.Pakistan's deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar is expected to take part in the meeting, the daily reported citing a diplomatic source, adding that “Islamabad’s participation was seen as significant.”An Arab official told AFP on condition of anonymity that the meeting is likely to be held in Turkiye on Friday. The format of the talks remains unclear, though the official said the main meeting would take place that day.A regional official told Reuters that the priority of the talks was to avoid conflict and de-escalate tensions between Iran and the US, adding that several regional powers had been invited at the foreign ministers’ level.According to the official, countries invited include Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, Oman and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).US outlet Axios, citing two sources and a US official, reported that Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi was expected to meet US envoy Steve Witkoff in Istanbul to discuss a possible agreement related to Iran’s nuclear programme.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian confirmed on Tuesday that he had instructed Araghchi to pursue “fair and equitable negotiations” in an environment “free from threats and unreasonable expectations”.The talks, he said in posts on X, would be held “within the framework of our national interests”.US President Donald Trump has said he is hopeful Washington would “work something out” with Iran but warned on Monday that “bad things would happen” if no deal was reached.In an interview with CNN on Sunday, Araghchi said: “President Trump said no nuclear weapons, and we fully agree. We fully agree with that. That could be a very good deal.”“In return, we expect sanctions to be lifted,” he added, while warning that Iran was prepared for war if talks failed, saying any conflict would likely spread beyond Iran.Turkiye has been leading diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions, with Araghchi visiting Istanbul last week and engaging with regional counterparts, including in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan.Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have assured Tehran that they would not allow their airspace or territory to be used for military action against Iran, while Jordan has said it would not act as a “launching pad” for any such action.","Pakistan has been invited to participate in upcoming talks between Iran and the United States.

Imran Khan’s Sisters Allege Illegal Isolation, Stage Protest Outside Adiala Jail





A Pakistani anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Tuesday issued non-bailable arrest warrants against Aleema Khan, sister of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan in connection with a protest held in Islamabad in November 2024.According to news agency PTI citing a media report, the warrants were issued by the ATC in Rawalpindi after Aleema Khan failed to appear before the court despite earlier directions.The court also issued non-bailable arrest warrants against her two guarantors and ordered that all three be arrested and produced before it on Wednesday, without fail. Aleema’s application seeking exemption from personal appearance was rejected.The case, registered at Sadiqabad Police Station, relates to a protest at D-Chowk in Islamabad on November 24, 2024 and includes charges of protesting against the government, chanting anti-government slogans, vandalism and stone-pelting. ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah conducted the hearing.The court also issued a show-cause notice to the Superintendent of Police (SP), Rawal, for failing to execute the arrest warrants.The SP has been directed to appear before the court on Wednesday and explain why Aleema Khan was not arrested and presented despite clear orders, according to Pakistani news website Express Tribune.During Monday’s hearing, Aleema Khan’s defence counsel sought a one-day exemption, citing difficulties in travel and daily affairs after her bank accounts, Computerised National Identity Card and passport were reportedly blocked. The court, however, did not accept the plea.The proceedings have drawn attention as Aleema Khan had earlier skipped multiple hearings in the case and appeared only after the court issued property seizure orders and several arrest warrants. She is among those nominated as accused in protest-related cases filed following the November demonstrations.The protest followed Imran Khan’s “final call” for nationwide demonstrations demanding the restoration of the party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) electoral mandate, the release of party leaders and the reversal of constitutional changes.The D-Chowk protest ended on November 26 after a security operation, with several cases registered across Rawalpindi district. In total, 29 cases linked to the protest have been filed in the district, with Imran Khan named in several and his wife, Bushra Bibi, charged in all 29 cases.","Pakistani anti-terrorism court issues non-bailable arrest warrants against Aleema Khan.

'Physically handicapped': Khawaja Asif's brutal admission as Pakistan forces battle BLA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/physically-handicapped-khawaja-asifs-brutal-admission-as-pakistan-forces-battling-bla-in-balochistan/articleshow/127880579.cms,"Balochistan Crisis: Pakistan-Origin Commentator Takes Apart Islamabad, Exposes Lies On India

Troops ‘physically handicapped’ by vast terrain

Insurgency background and wider fallout





Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif said the country’s security forces are “physically handicapped” by the sheer size of Balochistan as they battle a fresh surge in militant violence, after authorities reported killing 177 insurgents in sweeping counter-terror operations across the province.Addressing the national assembly, Asif described the scale of the challenge facing troops deployed in Pakistan’s largest and least populated province, where coordinated attacks triggered one of the deadliest security crises in recent years. His remarks came after militants launched simultaneous assaults in multiple towns, targeting civilians, homes and security installations.“Balochistan constitutes over 40 per cent of Pakistan geographically...To control it is much more difficult than a populated city, and it needs deployment of massive forces. Our troops are deployed there and are in action against them (terrorists), but they are physically handicapped by guarding and patrolling such a big area,” Asif told lawmakers, as quoted by PTI.Security officials said the death toll of militants had risen to 177 in the past two days following large-scale raids and gun battles.The operations were launched after insurgents carried out coordinated attacks at 12 locations, with authorities confirming that at least 17 police and security personnel were killed, along with dozens of civilians.Asif said the weekend violence claimed 33 civilian lives and 17 members of the security forces. He ruled out talks with the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), saying no negotiations would be held with “terrorists” responsible for killing civilians, including women and children.Balochistan, which borders Iran and Afghanistan, has long faced a separatist insurgency driven by ethnic Baloch groups who accuse the central government of discrimination and exploitation. Authorities say groups such as the BLA have targeted security forces, infrastructure and projects linked to the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor.Train services between Balochistan and the rest of Pakistan remained suspended for a third day, while mobile and internet services were cut in several districts during clean-up operations. Provincial officials said services were expected to resume once the security situation stabilised.Asif dismissed claims that Balochistan had been neglected, saying the province had seen development, including multiple airports. He also rejected the “missing persons” narrative, alleging that names of militants killed in operations had appeared on such lists. “This narrative has been concocted. I also used to support this cause and protest over it. But, terrorists and criminal elements have hijacked all these narratives,” he said.","Khawaja Asif says security forces are 'physically handicapped' by sheer size of Balochistan.

BNP Storms To Power In Bangladesh; Tarique Rahman To Become PM; India Congratulates Hasina's Rival





As Bangladesh moves towards the formation of a new democratically-elected govt led by the BNP, the family of 28-year-old Dipu Chandra Das - who wasburnt alive on Dec 18 last year - said they exercised their right to vote in the hope of securing justice.Dipu, a garment factory worker, was killed in a brutal attack that sent shockwaves across the world after a video of the attack was widely circulated on social media.On Thursday, all five eligible voters in his household cast their ballots in the Mymensingh-2 constituency of Mymensingh district. Speaking to TOI over the phone, his father, Rabi Chandra Das, said, ""All five voters in our household - including me, Dipu's mother, his wife, his brother and his aunt - exercised our franchise because we believe in the democratic values of the country. We now hope that the new govt will deliver justice to us. ""He said the family is trying to come to terms with the loss but the trauma remains raw. ""The scars will remain forever in our hearts. We just hope that the newly formed govt will expedite the process of delivering justice to our son, who never deserved such a fate,"" he added.Dipu's younger brother, Apu Chandra Das, 22, who is the complainant in the case naming a mob of around 140 people, said representatives of both the BNP and the Jamaat-e-Islami visited their home during the election campaign.""They urged us to use our voting rights for democracy and assured us of their support whenever required. While we continue to cope with the loss, we see participation in the electoral process as a step towards accountability and justice under the incoming govt,"" he said.On the night of Dec 18, Dipu was at work when two colleagues allegedly accused him of posting blasphemous content on social media. They assaulted him before handing him over to a mob waiting outside the factory. The crowd attacked him with canes and rods amid religious sloganeering, hanged him from a tree at a nearby square and set him ablaze. The assailants also recorded and circulated videos of the attack. Married three years ago, Dipu is survived by his wife and one-year-old daughter. He was the sole earner for a family of eight.","Dipu Chandra Das, 28, was killed in a brutal attack that sent shockwaves across the world after a video of the attack was widely circulated on social media.
