NEW DELHI: Kolkata Police defended the arrest of Instagram influencer Sharmistha Panoli, saying that legal action was taken not for her political views but for allegedly sharing a video that insulted religious beliefs and promoted communal disharmony.In a detailed statement posted on X, Kolkata Police dismissed claims circulating online that Panoli was targeted for expressing nationalist sentiments. “Some social media accounts are spreading false information that Kolkata Police has unlawfully arrested a law student for opposing Pakistan. This narrative is mischievous and misleading,” the statement read.The case against Panoli was registered on 15 May at Garden Reach Police Station. According to the police, the video in question was considered “insulting to the religious belief of a class of citizen of India and amounted to promoting disharmony and hatred between different communities.” The police said they had acted under relevant sections of the newly implemented Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS).Repeated attempts to serve legal notice to Panoli reportedly failed, with the police saying she was “absconding.”“Several attempts were made to serve notice u/s 35 of BNSS to the accused but every time she was found absconding,” Kolkata Police said. A court then issued a warrant for her arrest. She was apprehended from Gurugram, Haryana, during daytime hours and later presented before a magistrate, who granted transit remand. She was eventually sent to judicial custody.“Hate speech targeting any religious figure or community or any class of citizens of India which has potential to incite disharmony and hatred between different communities is a punishable offence... Hate speech & abusive language should not be misconstrued as freedom of speech & expression as enshrined in Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution,” the police said.Panoli, a 22-year-old law student from Pune, had deleted the video and issued a public apology on May 15. Her arrest on Friday night triggered political controversy and public debate. Actress and BJP MP Kangana Ranaut called the move excessive and said, “She should be released soon because she is a very young woman. She has her whole career and life ahead of her.”BJP’s Amit Malviya also criticised the arrest, accusing the state government of “appeasement politics” and questioned why no action was taken against chief minister Mamata Banerjee for her own allegedly divisive comments.","Kolkata Police defend arrest of Instagram influencer Sharmistha Panoli.

'We Had That Rectified': Shashi Tharoor Reveals What Led Colombia To Withdraw Remarks On Op Sindoor

NEW DELHI: The all-party delegations visiting various countries to expose Pakistan post the Pahalgam attack seem to be becoming a headache for the Congress with senior party leader and former external affairs minister Salman Khurshid's recent remarks backing nullification of Article 370 in 2019 by the Modi government likely to discomfit the Congress. This comes after another delegation member, Shashi Tharoor, faced strong criticism from within the party for his statement that India crossed the line of control (LoC) to conduct surgical strikes ""for the first time"" under the Modi government.While addressing think tanks and academia in Indonesia on Friday, Khurshid said it was unfortunate that Pakistan wants to undo the prosperity that has come to Jammu & Kashmir following the abrogation. Khurshid is part of one of the seven- all party delegations currently touring various countries. The Congress had initially opposed the move to scrap Article 370. The party later nuanced its position and has since been ambivalent on the issue of restoration of the Article which granted J&K special status.""Kashmir had a major problem for a long time. Much of that was reflected in the thinking of the government in an article called 370 of the Constitution, which somehow gave the impression that it was separate from the rest of the country.But Article 370 was abrogated, it was finally put to an end, because so much time had passed.,"" Khurshid said while addressing the Indonesian think tanks and academia.""Subsequently, there was an election with 65% participation. There's an elected government in Kashmir today, and therefore, for people to want to undo everything that has happened, the prosperity that has come to Kashmir, it is very unfortunate. It will give a setback to anybody,"" Khurshid further said.While the senior leadership made no comment on Khurshid's remarks, unease within the party has been brewing ever since the government announced the names for the 51 members of the all-party delegations. The Congress had accused the Modi government of ""complete insincerity"" and for playing ""cheap political games"" while highlighting that ""regrettably"" only one of the four names suggested by the Congress leadership has been included. However, the opposition party relented, allowing ""eminent"" party members selected by the government to go with the delegations and make their contribution.The Congress had submitted the names of Anand Sharma, Gaurav Gogoi, Syed Naseer Hussain, and Amrinder Singh Raja Warring. However, the delegation finalised by the government includes Shashi Tharoor who is leading a delegation.

Poll Do you believe the India-Pakistan truce was primarily a result of bilateral negotiations? Yes, it was purely bilateral. No, there was third-party involvement.

NEW DELHI: An all-party delegation on Sunday explained in detail how India-Pakistan truce was reached on May 10 which eventually led to the cessation of military operations by the two nations against each other. This comes amid US President Donald Trump's consistent claims about using trade as a was deterrent between the two nations.Reiterating the Centre's stance that the truce was purely bilateral and initiated by Pakistan, JDU MP Sanjay Kumar Jha, who is leading an all-party delegation, said that Pakistani DGMO (Director General of Military Operations) called for the ceasefire but there was a ""problem with the hotline"".""If I tell you specifically, they tried in the morning for the ceasefire, the DGMO of Pakistan, but there was a problem with the hotline. And then, their embassy in India, because people ask how the ceasefire happened, the people in Pakistan embassy in India got in touch with Indian people and conveyed that they are trying to get in touch with DGMO India but were not able to talk to him,"" he said, addressing an Indian diaspora in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.""Then there was a message that we will talk after 1.30 or 2. Then DGMO India talked to him. He requested for the ceasefire, that was around 3.35 in the afternoon. And then, India agreed for the ceasefire. Because India is not for war. We wanted to give a message, we wanted to demolish their terror infrastructure and that we have achieved,"" he added.Ironically, Donald Trump was first to announce the India-Pakistan truce on May 10 at 5.25pm, which is around two hours after Jha's claim of the talks between the two nations. India and Pakistan then confirmed the ceasefire.The opposition has since then, targeted the Centre demanding answers over third-party mediation in the truce. The central government has, at several occasions denied any third-party mediation in the ceasefire.India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7 in response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 people. The operation targeted terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, resulting in the deaths of over 100 militants from groups like Jaish-e-Mohammed, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and Hizbul Mujahideen.Pakistan retaliated with shelling and drone attacks, prompting India to strike radar systems, communication hubs, and airfields at 11 Pakistani airbases.

Others are exchanging news and information in newly formed encrypted group chats. And some have sought divine aid in ""visa temples"" - so called because Hindu devotees say prayers there provide a greater chance of getting a tourist, study or work visa.Career counsellors have become therapists, and the extended family networks that many Indians have in America, have set up war rooms online.

Ukraine carried out one of the largest drone attacks on Russia on Sunday targeting its military air bases and hitting nearly 34% of the strategic cruise missiles. The operation named ""Spider's Web"" involved months of meticulous planning and the covert transport of drones into Russian territory.Calling it a ""brilliant operation"", Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, ""Today, a brilliant operation was carried out. The preparation took over a year and a half. What’s most interesting, is that the 'office' of our operation on Russian territory was located directly next to FSB headquarters in one of their regions.""The Russian defence ministry also confirmed the strikes and said that 5 airbases were targeted across the country, however, it said that the attacks were ""successfully repelled"".Also read: Operation 'Spider Web': How Ukraine struck nuclear bombers thousands of kilometres inside Russia Ukraine has claimed that significant damage was inflicted, however, an independent verification is yet to take place. The country has claimed to have destroyed 34% of Russia's strategic bombers carrying cruise missiles, estimating damages at $7 billionAccording to a source in Ukraine's SBU security service, coordinated drone attacks hit 41 Russian aircraft.Targets included Tu-95 and Tu-22 strategic bombers, and A-50 radar detection and command aircraft.Calling it a ""terror attack"", Russia said in a statement, “All terror attacks on military airfields in the Ivanovo, Ryazan, and Amur Regions were repelled.”Analysts believe the attacks could be a strategic move by Zelenskyy to increase pressure on Moscow just before the second round of peace talks, set to take place Monday in Istanbul. Meanwhile, a Russian delegation headed by Kremlin aide Vladimir Medynsky has already arrived in Turkey for the negotiations.The country's defence ministry said that the drone strikes took place from within close proximity to airfields.“As a result of the launch of FPV drones from territories in the close proximity to military airfields in the Murmansk and Irkutsk Regions, several aircraft caught fire. The fires were extinguished,” it added.The Ukrainian SBU source said that the ""Spider's Web"" operation took more than 18 months to prepare and involved highly intricate logistical planning.This was also confirmed by Zelenskyy who said: ""The preparation took over a year and a half. What’s most interesting, is that the “office” of our operation on Russian territory was located directly next to FSB headquarters in one of their regions.""Giving information about the operation, Zelenskyy said that 117 drones were used in the operation.""In total, 117 drones were used in the operation with a corresponding number of drone operators involved. 34% of the strategic cruise missile carriers stationed at air bases were hit,"" he said.According to the Ukrainian security source, drones were covertly transported into Russia and concealed within wooden enclosures mounted on trucks. Russia's defence ministry acknowledged that the drones were launched not from Ukrainian territory, but from locations situated very close to the targeted airbases.Following the attack, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy proposed ""full and unconditional ceasefire"".""We continue to propose a full and unconditional ceasefire, along with all rational and dignified steps that could lead to a lasting and reliable peace. The Ukrainian proposal we presented to the Russians is logical and realistic,"" he said.""Not for a single second did we want this war. We offered the Russians a ceasefire. Since March 11, the U.S. proposal for a full and unconditional ceasefire has been on the table. It was the Russians who chose to continue the war – even under conditions where the entire world is calling for an end to the killing,"" he added.In a bid to pressurize Russia to cease the offensive against Ukraine, the latter has called for international sanctions on the country.""Pressure is truly needed, pressure on Russia that should bring it back to reality. Pressure through sanctions. Pressure from our forces. Pressure through diplomacy. All of it must work together,"" Zelenskyy said.Zelenskyy described it as Ukraine’s longest-range mission since the start of the war. A total of 117 drones were deployed to strike targets located thousands of kilometers from Ukrainian territory.Among the key targets were the Olenya airbase, situated approximately 1,900 kilometers away in the Russian Arctic, and the Belaya airbase, around 4,300 kilometers distant in eastern Siberia. In response, Russia reported that it had successfully repelled additional drone attacks in the regions of Ivanovo, Ryazan, and Amur, the latter lying near the Chinese border.Zelenskyy confirmed that Ukraine would continue this offensive. The drone operation has drawn strong reactions from Russian military circles, with bloggers describing it as a “black day for aviation.”The pro-Russian Rybar channel labeled the strike a “very heavy blow” and pointed to serious shortcomings in Russian intelligence. Beyond its tactical impact, the operation carries strong symbolic weight, providing a boost to Ukrainian morale amid mounting challenges on the front lines. Former Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko called the attacks a powerful negotiating tool for Ukraine ahead of upcoming talks with Moscow in Istanbul.","Ukraine carried out one of the largest drone attacks on Russia on Sunday targeting its military air bases and hitting nearly 34% of the strategic cruise missiles.

An autopsy revealed fractured ribs, leading to a murder investigation.





BENGALURU: On May 11, police recovered the half-naked body of a man in a bush of a vacant land opposite a medical college at Attibele, Anekal, Bengaluru Urban district. Lying supine, it bore no injury marks. Nor were there weapons near the body.Suspecting a death due to cardiac arrest or suicide, police registered a case of unnatural death.Later in the day, the body was identified as that of one Gangadharaiah, 60, a resident of Yadavanahalli on Sarjapura Road. A truck driver by profession, he lived with his wife and two children.According to his family, Gangadharaiah went missing after he left home on May 10. That day, they filed a complaint. Gangadharaiah's wife told police that his mobile phone was switched off. Police launched a search in the area for the phone, but they could not find it.Meanwhile, the body was shifted to hospital for an autopsy. Also, police kept an eye on the IME number of the mobile device. If anyone switched on the device, there would be an alert.A few days later came the shocking news from the doctors who carried out the autopsy.The ribs of the man were fractured, and hence he died, the doctors told cops.Asked how it could have happened as there were no apparent physical injuries on the body, the doctors opined that something hard hit Gangadharaiah's chest, resulting in breaking the ribs and killing him.However, his family members said they didn't suspect anyone behind the killing. Left with no further clues to continue the investigation, cops waited for the one possibility—Gangadharaiah's mobile phone becoming active.A special team led by police inspector S Raghavendra was formed to crack the mystery. Finally, Raghavendra received an alert showing that Gangadharaiah's mobile became active. ""It was switched on for an hour or so; a new SIM card was inserted, and the location was Salem, Tamil Nadu,"" Superintendent of police (Bengaluru Rural) CK Baba told STOI. A team was dispatched to Salem.There, another shocker awaited cops. They traced the man using Gangadharaiah's mobile phone to the bed of Salem govt hospital. The man, identified as Naresh Kumar Raja, 24, of Salem, had received a bullet shot in the leg by Tamil Nadu police. According to Tamil Nadu police records, Raja is wanted in at least 22 criminal cases, including three murders and more than a dozen robberies.""We questioned Raja on the hospital bed. He spilled the beans, saying he was the one who attacked Gangadharaiah but little did he know that the latter had died. Raja hit Gangadharaiah after confronting him inside the bush, sat on his stomach when the victim fell, and repeatedly punched him on the chest. As Gangadharaiah lost consciousness, Raja robbed him of the mobile phone and around Rs 5,000 in cash,"" the police officer who took a statement from Raja explained.According to Baba, Raja had the habit of robbing victims at desolate places at night. ""Though he (the accused) is a resident of Salem, he regularly visits Attibele, where his close relatives live. On the night of May 10, the accused alighted from a bus and was walking past the medical college ground when he noticed Gangadharaiah walking into the bush. Quickly, he followed the victim and attacked. The fatal blows by the accused killed the victim,"" he said.""Once he recovers from the bullet injury and Salem police complete their investigation, we will bring him here and continue our investigation,"" he said, adding that the case is now being treated as a murder for gain.","Bengaluru police initially investigated an unnatural death after finding a man's body with no visible injuries.

Departure from the White House

Road ahead for Katie Miller







Katie Miller, a seasoned political advisor and communications strategist, has officially departed the White House alongside Elon Musk following the end of their roles as special government employees. Miller, who previously served as an advisor and spokeswoman for Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), is now set to work for him full-time. Her transition marks a significant move in Musk’s continued involvement in U.S. policy and government reform initiatives, especially after his highly publicized 130-day stint in Washington, D.C. Miller’s influence in both political and tech circles has made her a central figure in the DOGE initiative.Katie Miller is married to Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, according to insiders cited by WIRED. Katie, who served as the spokesperson for Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), will now work full-time for Musk. Meanwhile, social media has been rife with rumours speculating that Katie left her husband Stephen Miller for Elon Musk, suggesting the three were involved in a “throuple” during Musk’s time at the White House.Katie acted as the crucial link between Musk and the administration, often delivering bad news to him, while she and Stephen also helped navigate Musk through Washington. Rumors suggest Stephen Miller “used” his wife as Musk’s handler and bragged about controlling Musk, though these remain unconfirmed. A senior Republican strategist described Katie as a powerful figure who “leaves bodies everywhere she’s been.” Despite Musk’s exit signalling possible tensions with Trump, some Republicans like Vice President JD Vance believe Musk’s political influence will continue, cautioning that the “Elon era” is far from over.Katie Miller holds a BA from the University of Florida and a Master of Public Policy from George Washington University. She began her political career as a press assistant for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, later serving as press secretary for Senator Steve Daines and spokeswoman for Senator Martha McSally. In 2017, she joined the Department of Homeland Security as deputy press secretary, where she defended the Trump administration’s family separation policy. She went on to serve as press secretary and then communications director for Vice President Mike Pence, becoming a key figure in Republican communications.In December 2024, Donald Trump announced Miller’s appointment to the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), where she became a close advisor to Elon Musk. According to WIRED, she was a key intermediary between DOGE and the rest of the White House, responsible for delivering daily messaging and managing Musk’s political communication.Miller’s responsibilities grew to include coordinating Musk’s media appearances, particularly around SpaceX’s Starship launch and broader tech policy. Her influence in DOGE was described as ""pivotal"" by insiders, and she helped shape Musk’s messaging and manage sensitive government interactions.Musk’s tenure as a special government employee ended in May 2025 after 130 days, and Miller’s term concluded alongside his. Following their departure, CBS News confirmed that Miller would continue working for Musk full-time, leading communications across his ventures. Her shift to the private sector marks a new phase in their professional collaboration.Katie Miller's unique role bridging government policy and technological innovation positions her as an influential figure in both political and tech worlds. As Musk plans to step back from political spending and re-evaluate his role in public policy, Miller’s communications acumen will likely continue to play a major role in shaping the public narrative around Musk’s ventures.Her next chapter, outside of government but still within the realm of high-stakes influence, will be closely watched as Musk’s enterprises continue to blur the line between Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C.","Katie Miller has officially departed the White House alongside Elon Musk.

GURGAON: Behind the closed doors of an apartment at Ridgewood Estate, the muffled cries of a nonagenarian man and his octogenarian wife have stirred neighbours into action, making it a rare case of a community seeking the state's intervention to guarantee care, safety and dignity for the allegedly abandoned couple.Left in the care of two untrained attendants by their son who is abroad, residents of the society, also members of Ridgewood Estate Condominium Association (RECA), said they repeatedly tried to contact the son, but their appeals fell on deaf ears. The association then approached Haryana Human Rights Commission (HHRC), which took cognisance immediately and ordered a comprehensive medical, psychological, and social assessment of the couple by govt.The couple has been living here for three years, when the son purchased the flat and moved them, transferring power of attorney to his father, according to RECA. However, two caregivers working in day and night shifts became the couple's only connection with the outside world soon after. Concerned neighbours visited, making inquiries and offering assistance, but were turned away at the door.Residents said the son regularly made online payments for maintenance charges for the flat, but the association had no information about his whereabouts except his phone number and email ID in the society's records.None recollected having seen him in the compound either.""All we know is that he lives somewhere abroad. Earlier, a lady would visit the elderly couple, but she stopped coming a few months ago. We requested the son to visit his parents or arrange some help for them, but to no avail. The woman is bedridden, and the man's cries of distress echo in the corridor. It's deeply distressing,"" said Kittu Mathur, the association secretary.Mathur said they had no information about the couple, not even their names. The couple have never attended any society event. Last month, an elderly neighbour ventured in seeing the door ajar and discovered the house to be in a complete mess, according to RECA members. A few days later, the son allegedly responded with a threat to lodge a police complaint against the neighbour for trespass.Lalit Batra, the HHRC chairperson, expressed deep concern over the couple's prolonged mental and physical suffering, calling it a blatant violation of Article 21 of the Constitution, which guarantees the right to live with dignity. The rights panel emphasised that such situations were not merely ""private family matters"" but public human rights concerns. ""Failure to ensure essential medical care, emotional support, and regular supervision reflects gross negligence. It amounts to a breach of not only the basic human rights of the senior citizens themselves but also of the larger community that has been involuntarily subjected to such trauma,"" the rights panel observed.Describing the situation as ""alarmingly tragic"", HHRC noted that the elderly should receive full family support, especially when they require love, care, and medical intervention the most. ""Society and the state have a shared responsibility to intervene when the elderly are deprived of due care and dignity,"" the commission said.Batra ordered immediate intervention in the case, asking the deputy commissioner to form a multi-disciplinary medical and welfare committee. This team, comprising the police commissioner, sub-divisional magistrate, civil surgeon, and district social welfare officer, must now assess the couple's condition and submit a comprehensive care plan before the next hearing on July 3. Puneet Arora, the commission's protocol officer, assured strict compliance by all authorities.","Couple left in the care of two untrained attendants by their son who is abroad.

"Karnataka high court orders demolition of illegal building, recovery of costs from BBMP officials",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/karnataka-high-court-orders-demolition-of-illegal-building-recovery-of-costs-from-bbmp-officials/articleshow/121554228.cms,"



Bengaluru: In a strong move against civic apathy and unauthorised construction, the high court ordered the demolition of an illegal building at JP Nagar 5th Phase and directed that the costs be recovered from BBMP officials who failed to prevent the violation.The case centres around a residential building at Nanjundeshwara Layout, which local residents alleged was coming up without an approved building plan. Complaints were raised in Feb 2020, and during a site inspection, a BBMP joint commissioner confirmed the structure had no sanctioned plan. He assured the residents that the building would be demolished. But action never came.Instead, the builder allegedly colluded with BBMP engineers to procure a backdated plan. ""They issued a 2021 plan and backdated it to 2020 to show as if it had been obtained before the construction. But the document was forged. The Anti-Corruption Bureau confirmed this during its inquiry,"" said a resident who closely followed the case.Despite a Karnataka Appellate Tribunal ruling in favour of its demolition, BBMP remained inactive. The builder then moved the high court with the same forged documents. However, the court wasn't convinced.The involvement of BBMP officials came to light after the case was escalated in court by the building owner himself.Justice Sanjay Gowda, in his April 26 order, pulled no punches. He pointed out that the building plan was approved on March 6, 2021, while the spot inspection by the joint commissioner had occurred earlier, on Feb 28, 2021. The assistant director of town planning (ADTP) not only approved the plan but also issued a building licence on March 24, 2021.""The fact that the engineer was able to provide the licence plan number and the date itself indicates the nature of collusion between the applicant and the engineers concerned,"" the court noted.The building had massive deviations from the sanctioned norms. ""As could be seen from the above, in respect of setback, there are deviations ranging from 20% to 95%. In respect of coverage, there is a deviation of 48.1%, in respect of built-up area, there is a deviation of 73.2% and in respect of FAR, there is a deviation of 73%. The report also points out that there is a violation of the sanctioned height by about 2.2 metres and there is an extra floor constructed. The report also indicates that there is a deviation to the extent of 48.1% in respect of all floors put up and this would therefore fundamentally indicate that there is a gross violation from the sanctioned plan which in fact was cancelled,"" the court said.Citing Section 321-B of the Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act, the court clarified that if BBMP officers fail to stop illegal construction, they can be penalised. The more violations they overlook, the heavier the penalties.The court has now directed BBMP to take strict action. This includes holding an inquiry into officials, including retired ones who were involved in sanctioning the post-demolition plan. The court said BBMP should also recover the cost of demolition from these officials.""BBMP would also have to take action against the ADTP who sanctioned the plan after the order of confirmation was passed on March 19, 2021,"" the court noted.—-——-BoxA wake up call, says neighbourVV Madhusudana Rao, the neighbour who complained about the violation to BBMP told TOI, ""This is purely a residential society and how can we have a building built in violation (of rules)? There were a lot of twists and turns in the case with the petitioner complaining to BBMP that even my building is in violation... The HC in fact noted that the petitioner has wasted BBMP's and the court's time with false complaints. Such verdicts should be a wake up call for people building multiple floors and officials approving the plans and turning a blind eye to such violations.

GUWAHATI: Authorities mounted a rescue mission in flood-hit Assam and deployed an Indian Air Force helicopter in rescue operations on Sunday as some 3.64 lakh people remained affected by floods across 19 districts of Assam, according to the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) report.The flooding was caused by rising water levels in the Brahmaputra and Barak rivers and their tributaries amid heavy rainfall and water flowing down from neighbouring states. Cachar district was the worst affected with 1.03 lakh people impacted, while over 10,000 people have been shifted to relief camps.Elsewhere across the northeast, landslide and flood-hit people struggled to piece together their lives as authorities said the situation in Manipur and Tripura still remained grim despite rains staying away during the day and clouds clearing up.Two flood-related deaths were reported on Sunday - a child in Cachar and a man in Sribhumi district - bringing the total death toll from landslides and floods in the northeast since Friday to 34 following heavy downpours.Another 21,000 people in five districts of Assam have been affected by urban flooding, with knee-deep water continuing to hamper movement in low-lying areas of Guwahati.All seven northeastern states experienced excess rainfall in the last 24 hours.Red alerts have been issued for Hailakandi and Sribhumi districts of Assam for Monday, as well as for Khowai and West Tripura districts in Tripura.The Brahmaputra river breached the danger level at Neamatighat in Jorhat district, while its tributaries Burhidihing, Dhansiri, and Kopili, along with several rivers in Barak Valley, were flowing above danger levels according to the Central Water Commission's Sunday evening report.Union home minister Amit Shah spoke with CM Himanta Biswa Sarma, Manipur governor Ajay Bhalla, and Arunachal Pradesh CM Pema Khandu on Sunday to assess the flood and rain situation.""Hon'ble Home Minister Shri @AmitShah Ji called me a short while ago to enquire about the floods in Assam and has offered all possible assistance to deal with the ongoing situation,"" Sarma informed through a post on X.Sarma warned on Sunday that heavy rainfall in Arunachal Pradesh's Kibitoo, Hayuliang, and Kalaktang areas may lead to a sharp rise in river levels downstream in Assam.The Indian Air Force rescued 14 people, including 13 workers, from Assam's Tinsukia district on Sunday. A defence PRO said it was a critical humanitarian assistance and disaster relief mission launched early Sunday morning in response to requests from the state administrations of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. ""Fourteen people stranded in the middle of the flooded Bomjir river in Lower Dibang Valley of Arunachal Pradesh, cut off from the mainland, were safely rescued to a secure location.

The family currently lives in Gudha Gorji, Jhunjhunu. Her mother, Anita, is a teacher.Ishita did her schooling from Rana International School, Degana, in Nagaur district of Rajasthan. She passed Class XII with physics, chemistry, and mathematics.Charan Singh said Ishita and her twin sister, Astha, always excelled in academics. While Astha is currently pursuing MBBS from GMC, Surat, Ishita always dreamt of becoming a fighter pilot. Her aspirations took flight when the Supreme Court in 2021 allowed women to join the NDA.""I informed her of the opportunity just 28 days before the NDA written examination.She was confident of qualifying despite the limited time for preparation,"" recalled Charan Singh. In total, 1,78,000 women candidates had applied, competing for just 19 vacancies — only two of which were in the Air Force flying branch.Since the family had no military background, Ishita prepared for the Services Selection Board (SSB) interview using YouTube and other online resources. Her SSB interview was held in Bengaluru, and after qualifying, she went on to clear the Computerised Pilot Selection System (CPSS), which is mandatory for Air Force flying candidates. After successfully completing the medical examination, she was selected and officially joined the NDA on August 9, 2022.All of this happened while she was simultaneously preparing for her Class XII board exams, in which she scored 90.60%, having earlier secured 90% in Class X.""Ishita told us that the training at NDA had been extremely rigorous, keeping them occupied from 5 am to 10 pm every day,"" her father said with pride.MSID:: 121536747 413 |","Ishita Sangwan is a part of the first-ever batch of the women cadets that successfully passed out of the National Defence Academy (NDA), Pune.

Here's how the operation was executed:

'Drones smuggled, hidden under roofs'







Ukraine's Operation ""Spider's Web"", one of the largest drone attacks carried out by the war-torn nation, hit 41 Russian planes stationed at military airfields on Sunday. In a bold intelligence feat, the operation was coordinated from an office located directly next to local Russian intelligence headquarters.For the first time, Russia officially acknowledged the attack and reported that the Olenogorsk airfield in the Murmansk region and the Sredny airfield in Irkutsk, Siberia, were attacked from nearby spots using trailer trucks as launch platforms.According to a Ukrainian official, the drones struck 41 aircraft at Russian military airfields, targeting key assets including A-50 radar planes and long-range Tu-95 and Tu-22M bombers—aircraft Moscow has previously used to launch missile attacks on Ukraine or coordinate targeting and air defense operations. Ukraine’s security service claimed the operation destroyed 34% of Russia’s fleet of air-launched missile carriers, estimating the damage at $7 billion—a figure that has not been independently verified.The planning and execution of the operation, however, was ""extremely complex"", AP reported citing a military source.Ukraine’s unprecedented drone assault, codenamed was the result of over a year and a half of meticulous planning and was personally overseen by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.To be precise, Zelenskyy said that it took ""one year, six months, and nine days from the start of planning to effective execution.""In what could be Russia's biggest intelligence failure, the Ukrainian operation's office was located ""directly next to FSB headquarters in one of their regions."" The FSB is the Russian intelligence and security service.""Today, a brilliant operation was carried out. The preparation took over a year and a half. What’s most interesting, is that the 'office' of our operation on Russian territory was located directly next to FSB headquarters in one of their regions,"" Zelenskyy said.The drones used were smuggled into Russia, AP reported citing military sources. It added that the drones were hidden under roofs and trucks.“Later, drones were hidden under the roofs of these houses while already placed on trucks. At the right moment, the roofs of the houses were remotely opened, and the drones flew to hit Russian bombers,” the source said.Russia also said that the drones were launched not from Ukrainian territory, but from locations situated very close to the targeted airbases.Footage circulating on Russian social media appeared to show drones launching from within containers, with detached panels scattered along the roadside.","Ukraine's Operation ""Spider's Web"" hit 41 Russian planes stationed at military airfields on Sunday.

Eyewitnesses shared harrowing details of an attack in Colorado where a suspect used a ""makeshift flamethrower"" and threw Molotov cocktails that burned six victims during a march in support of Israeli hostages. The FBI described the incident ""targeted terror attack.""Ed Victor, a participant in the Run For Their Lives' walk, explained that these silent marches have occurred weekly since the Hamas attack of October 7, 2023, aiming to highlight the situation of hostages in Gaza. The group, comprising approximately 30 people that Sunday, regularly pauses at the courthouse to engage in songs, storytelling and recitation of hostages' names.According to Victor, while the marchers occasionally face verbal opposition, they maintain their peaceful procession along Pearl Street without responding. He noted that passersby often show support through applause, nods or expressions of gratitude. The possibility of a physical attack had never crossed his mind.""So we stood up, lined up in front of the old Boulder courthouse, and I was actually on the far west side.And there was somebody there that I didn't even notice, although he was making a lot of noise, but I'm just focused on my job of being quiet and getting lined up. And, from my point of view, all of a sudden, I felt the heat. It was a Molotov cocktail equivalent, a gas bomb in a glass jar, thrown. Av [another marcher] saw it, a big flame as high as a tree, and all I saw was someone on fire,"" he told to CBS News.Victor described their efforts to extinguish the fire. while a marcher with medical expertise attended to the injured woman, Victor remained with her husband to provide support.

I came out, it was chaos, people were writhing on the ground. It was traumatic to watch, to be honest with you.

Concerned about potential violence, she decided to investigate the situation.""I saw this big fire go up,"" Brooke Coffman informed NBC affiliate KUSA of Denver. She immediately contacted emergency services whilst moving towards the incident.She observed two women in their undergarments who had removed their burning attire, displaying severe burns on their legs.

A peaceful gathering in downtown Boulder in Colorado turned into chaos on Sunday when a man shouted “Free Palestine” and threw an incendiary device into a group raising awareness for Israeli hostages in Gaza. Law enforcement officials said the suspect used a makeshift flamethrower, injuring six people, some with serious burns.The attacker, identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, is expected to face charges. The FBI is investigating the incident as a ""terrorist act.""The attack took place on Pearl Street Mall, a popular four-block pedestrian area in Boulder, and comes amid rising global tensions over the Israel-Hamas war.Just a week ago, a man reportedly yelling the same slogan fatally shot two Israeli embassy staffers in Washington.“Sadly, attacks like this are becoming too common across the country,” said Mark Michalek, special agent in charge of the FBI's Denver field office. “This is an example of how perpetrators of violence continue to threaten communities across the nation,” he said.According to officials, the victims range from 67 to 88 years old and suffered injuries ranging from minor to serious.The group had just wrapped up a weekly demonstration organised by 'Run For Their Lives', which calls for the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.A witness captured part of the chaos on video, shouting: “He’s right there. He’s throwing Molotov cocktails,” as police approached a shirtless man holding containers in both hands.Lynn Segal, 72, who was among the roughly 20 participants, described seeing a “rope of fire” shoot in front of her, followed by “two big flares.”“There were people who were burning, I wanted to help,” Segal said. “But I didn’t want to be associated with the perpetrator.”She shared that while she supports Palestine and was wearing a pro-Palestine shirt, she feared she might be mistaken as being connected to the attacker.Authorities confirmed Soliman acted alone and are not seeking any other suspects. He was also injured in the incident and taken to a hospital, though details of his condition have not been released. While no formal charges have yet been announced, officials assured the public that Soliman will be held accountable.FBI deputy director Dan Bongino stated: “This act of terror is being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence, and witness accounts. We will speak clearly on these incidents when the facts warrant it.”The justice department condemned the attack as a ""needless act of violence"", referencing a recent wave of attacks targeting Jewish Americans.This latest violence is part of the growing unrest since October 7, 2023, when Hamas militants killed about 1200 people in southern Israel and took around 250 hostages.Today, 58 hostages remain in Gaza, with about a third believed to be alive.Israel’s military response has killed over 54,000 people in Gaza, according to the Gaza health ministry, and displaced about 90% of the population, leaving most reliant on international aid.Sunday's incident also brought back memories of a mass shooting in Boulder four years ago, when a gunman killed four people at a local grocery store. He was later sentenced to life in prison.After the attack, police evacuated multiple blocks of Pearl Street. Armed officers and K9 units swept the area, urging the public to stay away as they searched for additional threats.","A man shouted 'Free Palestine' and threw an incendiary device into a group raising awareness for Israeli hostages in Gaza.

Kristi Noem Faces Intense US Senate Grilling Over Sick American Child’s Deportation





US homeland security secretary Kristi Noem 's claim that an undocumented immigrant had threatened to assassinate US President Donald Trump is now under scrutiny, as new evidence suggests the man may have been falsely accused to force his deportation.Noem had announced the arrest of 54-year-old Ramon Morales Reyes, alleging he had sent a letter vowing to shoot Trump and then flee to Mexico. The letter, shared by Noem and later highlighted by the White House and Trump allies on social media, was written in light blue ink and appeared to express fury over immigration policies.However, a person familiar with the investigation told the AP that authorities now believe Morales Reyes did not write the letter. Instead, law enforcement suspected that he was framed, possibly to prevent him from testifying in an upcoming trial in which he is listed as a victim of assault. The source said that the handwritten threat did not match Morales Reyes' writing style after which officials concluded that the threat was not credible.Despite this, the department of homeland security issued a statement naming Morales Reyes as the author and describing him as a threat, a move that has drawn criticism and confusion.The department has since said the investigation remains “ongoing,” and that Reyes is in the country illegally and has a criminal record.His legal team disputed those claims, saying he is not currently facing any charges and has no knowledge of past convictions.“There is really no way that it could be even remotely true,” said Kime Abduli, Morales Reyes’ immigration lawyer. “We're asking for a clarification and a correction from DHS to clear Ramon’s name of anything having to do with this.”Morales Reyes, a dishwasher in Milwaukee, was arrested on 21 May and is currently being held at a county jail in Juneau, Wisconsin. He lives with his wife and three children and had recently applied for a U visa, which offers protection to undocumented immigrants who have been victims of serious crimes.The immigrant rights group Voces de la Frontera has called for his release, and Morales Reyes is expected to appear before a Chicago immigration court next week for a bond hearing.Meanwhile, Milwaukee police have launched a separate investigation into possible identity theft and witness intimidation in connection with the case. The local district attorney’s office confirmed the matter is under active review.Morales Reyes had been due to testify in a July trial involving a man accused of assaulting him, a case that may now be further complicated by his sudden detention.","Ramon Morales Reyes, 54, was arrested on 21 May and is currently being held at a county jail in Juneau, Wisconsin.

Michelle Obama Gets Candid About Mental Health: 'I'm In Therapy...'





Former First Lady Michelle Obama is drawing criticism after saying that creating life is ""the least"" of what a woman's reproductive system does. The remarks came during the latest episode of her podcast 'IMO with Michelle Obama & Craig Robinson. 'In a wide-ranging discussion on women's health and abortion rights, Obama said the conversation around reproductive issues has been unfairly narrowed. ""Women's reproductive health is about our life,"" she said. ""It's about this whole complicated reproductive system that the least of what it does is produce life. It's a very important thing that it does, but you only produce life if the machine that's producing it — if you want to whittle us down to a machine — is functioning in a healthy, streamlined kind of way. ""The former first lady emphasised that the lack of medical research and understanding of women's health often leads to narrow or misguided political decision-making, particularly among male lawmakers. She also criticised Republican men for inaction on abortion rights, accusing them of ""trading out women's health for a tax break or whatever it is.""Additionally, Obama aimed at GOP women, suggesting some had voted for US President Donald Trump because of their husbands' influence.""There are a lot of women who vote the way their man is going to vote,"" she said. ""It happened in this election.""Her comments quickly ignited backlash on social media and from conservative figures, who accused Obama of diminishing the importance of motherhood.""Motherhood is the most beautiful and powerful gift God gave women. Creating life isn't a side effect, it's a miracle,"" wrote Danielle D'Souza Gill, a prominent pro-life advocate and wife of Rep. Brandon Gill, R-Texas. ""Don't let the Left cheapen it.""Isabel Brown, a conservative author and influencer, also lashed out. ""I am SO sick and tired of celebrities and elitists attempting to convince you that your miraculous superpower ability to GROW LIFE from nothing is somehow demeaning and ‘lesser than' for women,"" she posted.Social media users echoed those sentiments, with some questioning whether Obama's comments reflected her views on her own children.

Devarjaye 'DJ' Daniel, the 13-year-old Texas boy who captured hearts across America with his courage in battling terminal brain cancer and his dream of becoming a police officer, has been diagnosed with three new tumours, the White House confirmed on Friday.DJ, who was sworn in by US President Donald Trump earlier this year during a joint session of Congress, became a national symbol of resilience and hope. Despite receiving a grim prognosis in 2018, doctors then said he had less than five months to live. DJ has undergone numerous brain surgeries and defied expectations, thanks in part to a clinical research program.His father, Theodis Daniel, shared the news with White House officials.“We’re lifting up Agent DJ Daniel in prayer after his dad, Theodis, shared that DJ is now facing three new tumors,” the White House posted on X. “DJ is one of the strongest, bravest young men—and has now been sworn into 1,351 law enforcement agencies across the country. Agent Daniel, you're a true legend.”DJ’s dream of becoming a police officer has taken him on a cross-country journey of honour. With the support of law enforcement agencies nationwide, he has been ceremonially sworn in by over 1,300 departments, surpassing his original goal of 1,000 and setting a new benchmark of inspiration.His most recent swearing-in was with the Williamson County sheriff’s office in Texas. Deputy Jeffrey Combs recalled the emotional moment: “I saw Theodis pick his son up. I felt that unconditional love, and I just knew I had to find DJ. So, it all worked out.”In April, DJ was also named an honorary officer of the United States park police by interior secretary Doug Burgum, himself a cancer survivor.Speaking to FOX 7 Austin, Theodis Daniel described the toll the new diagnosis has taken on the family. “It’s rough. There isn’t a class that can teach you how to deal with it. You’re hearing that your child has a nasty disease,” he said. “We’re just winging it day by day.”Despite the worsening prognosis, DJ’s family continues to spread a message of unity and compassion. “We're just going around showing people, ‘Hey, you do care for one another,’” Theodis said. “Let’s give compassion, and let’s try to join and help each other get through things.”","Devarjaye 'DJ' Daniel, 13, has been diagnosed with three new tumours.

"Cory Booker makes controversial 'Nazi' gesture at convention, Elon Musk reacts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cory-booker-makes-controversial-nazi-gesture-at-convention-elon-musk-reacts/articleshow/121546179.cms,"US senator Cory Booker (Video grab from X @nicksortor)





A gesture made by US senator Cory Booker at the California Democratic convention on Saturday is drawing widespread comparisons to a similar move by Elon Musk earlier this year, and now, Musk himself has weighed in.Booker concluded his speech to delegates with an extended-arm gesture that many on social media likened to a Nazi salute — the same controversial comparison that was made when Musk placed his hand on his chest and then extended it outward during Donald Trump’s second inauguration.At the time, Musk was harshly criticised by many Democrats, who claimed the move resembled fascist symbolism. Musk defended his gesture, explaining it as a heartfelt message: “My heart goes out to you.”Now, with Booker, a prominent Democrat, making a near-identical gesture, Musk reacted to the video with an emoji on his X handle.Booker, 56, has not responded to the viral claims. The moment came as Booker addressed delegates, encouraging them to “get into some good trouble,” quoting the late civil rights icon John Lewis.The senator focused much of his speech on the need to resist US President Donald Trump’s agenda and rebuild trust with voters.“I think the Democratic Party lost a lot of elections because people didn't believe that they cared about them,” he said. “So let's stop worrying about the politics and get more focused on the people.”He went on to stress the importance of activism and creativity in civic engagement.“I know one thing it's not is sitting down and doing nothing and just watching on TV and getting stuck in a state of sedentary agitation. Everybody has to be taking measures to put the pressure on to change,” he said.However, the speech’s closing moment quickly overshadowed the rest of his speech.“I’m literally shaking right now. Cory Booker is literally Hitler,” one social media user wrote.Another post read, “Cory Booker does a NAZI SALUTE at the California Democratic Convention HOLY CRAP! LITERALLY HITLER!”Booker, who ran for president in 2020, said after the convention that he’s focused on running for reelection to the senate in 2026. When asked about a possible 2028 presidential bid, he replied, “2028 will take care of itself.”Critics have also pointed out that earlier this year, former Trump adviser Steve Bannon faced similar scrutiny for a comparable gesture.",US senator Cory Booker made an extended-arm gesture at the California Democratic convention.

Protest erupts over ban on Vemuri





Indian-American student Megha Vemuri was barred from the commencement event Friday after the class president used her platform to speak for Palestine a day before. Vemuri was scheduled to be the marshal for Friday's commencement ceremony but MIT Chancellor Melissa Nobles sent her an email Friday morning saying that she could not attend the event and she and her family were banned from campus for most of the day, Boston Globe reported.“Participation in Commencement activities is a privilege,” Nobles wrote in the email. “You deliberately and repeatedly misled Commencement organizers. While we acknowledge your right to free expression, your decision to lead a protest from the stage, disrupting an important institute ceremony, was a violation of MIT’s time, place and manner rules for campus expression.”Vemuri replied to the mail and said that her speech amounted to ""a protest from the stage"" and the campus ban was ""an overreach"".An MIT spokesperson in a statement said the institute “stands by its decision” to bar Vemuri from campus and said the speech she gave “was not the one that was provided by the speaker in advance.”Melissa Nobles had to halt her speech on Friday because of the chants from students who protested the ban on Vemuri. “Excuse me, I respect that you have a message to send but this is not the time or place,” Nobles said over the sound of the protest on Friday.“Today is about our graduates and their families. Please respect them and allow me to continue.”Vemuri slammed MIT in her speech for its ties with Israel and accused MIT of being ""directly complicit in the ongoing genocide of the Palestinian people"".""You have faced the obstacle of fear before and you turned it into fuel to stand up for what is right.

Who is Mohamed Sabry Soliman? Suspect in Colorado firebomb attack shouted 'Free Palestine',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-mohamed-sabry-soliman-suspect-in-colorado-firebomb-attack-shouted-free-palestine/articleshow/121559017.cms,"Who is Mohamed Sabry Soliman?



Attack caught on video, motive under probe







Six people were hospitalised after a man shouting “Free Palestine” allegedly lit them on fire during a pro-Israel demonstration in Boulder, Colorado, on Sunday. The FBI has identified the suspect as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, an Egyptian national who is in the United States illegally after overstaying his visa.FBI Denver Field Office special agent Mark Michalek said Soliman used a makeshift flamethrower to target attendees of a vigil for Israeli hostages. “As a result of these preliminary facts, it is clear that this is a targeted act of violence and the FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism,” Michalek stated.The six victims, aged between 67 and 88, sustained injuries ranging from minor to severe burns. According to journalist Collin Rugg, citing Fox News’ Bill Melugin, Soliman entered the US on August 27, 2022, through Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) during the Biden administration. “The Boulder terror suspect is an Egyptian national in the US illegally as a visa overstay who entered the US during the Biden administration,” Melugin reported.Mohamed Sabry Soliman, described by authorities as the man behind Sunday’s attack, is reportedly a foreign national who overstayed his visa after arriving in the US two years ago. While the FBI confirmed his Egyptian nationality, journalist Laura Loomer has claimed that Soliman is originally an immigrant from Kuwait who entered under what she called “Joe Biden’s open border policies.”In a post on X, Loomer alleged, “Mohamad Soliman, the Muslim man who carried out the Islamic terrorist attack in Colorado today, appears to be an immigrant from Kuwait who recently arrived in the US under Joe Biden’s open border policies 2 years ago.”Loomer also said a professional profile matching Soliman's name and appearance suggested he worked in finance, digital marketing, and international financial reporting. She further claimed he has a daughter studying in Colorado.Eyewitness Brooke Coffman, 19, described the chaotic aftermath: “Everybody is yelling, ‘get water, get water,’” she said, recalling seeing four women with burns, one of them wrapped in a flag. A video from the scene shows a shirtless man—believed to be Soliman—holding spray bottles as flames burn on the ground. He is heard shouting, “End Zionists!”, “Palestine is Free!” and “They are killers!” at people trying to assist the injured.Also read: 'Targeted terror attack': Man attacks crowd with firebombs in Colorado, several injured The attack took place during a gathering organised by ‘Run For Their Lives’, a global initiative advocating for the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza. Soliman was taken into custody shortly after the incident. While no charges have been formally announced yet, authorities have said they intend to hold him “fully accountable.”Police evacuated multiple blocks around 13th and Pearl Streets, deploying K-9 units and advising the public to stay clear of the area. FBI Director Kash Patel said agents were on-site and more updates would be shared soon.The attack comes amid a surge in antisemitic incidents across the United States. Just last week, a man was arrested after fatally shooting two Israeli embassy staffers while shouting “Free, Free Palestine.”Colorado Governor Jared Polis condemned the violence, stating, “Hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable,” and said he was “closely monitoring” the situation.(This is a top Google Trends topic)","Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, allegedly used a makeshift flamethrower to set six people on fire during a pro-Israel demonstration in Boulder, Colorado.

US President Donald Trump issued a stark warning on Sunday, following the legal challenge to his controversial tariff policy, claiming that blocking his emergency powers could bring a disaster for the American economy.Taking to his social media platform, Truth Social, he wrote, “If the Courts somehow rule against us on Tariffs, which is not expected, that would allow other Countries to hold our Nation hostage with their anti-American Tariffs that they would use against us.""""This would mean the Economic ruination of the United States of America!” he further warned.His remarks follow the US Court of International Trade's ruling that Trump had exceeded his authority by invoking emergency powers to impose sweeping tariffs on imports from nearly every country. The court said the move was a misuse of the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which is intended for actual emergencies.However, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit temporarily blocked that ruling on Thursday, granting the Trump administration permission to continue collecting tariffs while the case is under appeal.According to a statement from the appeals court, “The request for an immediate administrative stay is granted to the extent that the judgments and the permanent injunctions entered by the Court of International Trade in these cases are temporarily stayed until further notice while this court considers the motions papers.”The legal tug-of-war has deepened the uncertainty surrounding Trump’s tariff regime, which during his presidency was blamed for market volatility, disrupted supply chains, and contributing to inflationary pressure.While the latest court order offers a temporary reprieve for Trump’s trade agenda, the final outcome remains undecided, and could have far-reaching consequences for US trade policy and the global economy.","US President Donald Trump issued a stark warning on Sunday, following the legal challenge to his controversial tariff policy.

"'Putin is a thug': US senators say he’s stalling peace with Ukraine, planning new offensive",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/putin-is-a-thug-us-senators-say-hes-stalling-peace-with-ukraine-planning-new-offensive/articleshow/121554012.cms,"Vladimir Putin (left); Donald Trump (right): File photo





Two senior US senators have warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin is deliberately delaying peace negotiations while gearing up for a fresh military offensive in Ukraine.Speaking from Paris on Sunday, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and Democrat Senator Richard Blumenthal said the coming two weeks could be crucial in shaping the future of a war that has devastated cities, displaced millions, and reshaped Europe’s security landscape.The senators met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and visited areas devastated by what they described as the worst Russian bombardments since the full-scale invasion began. Now in Paris for talks with French President Emmanuel Macron who they say is “100% aligned” with their views, they cautioned that the window to prevent another assault is rapidly closing.Central to their efforts is a sweeping bipartisan US sanctions bill aimed at crippling the Kremlin’s war economy. The legislation, which has broad support in the Senate but faces uncertain prospects in Washington, would impose crippling tariffs of 500% on countries continuing to import Russian oil, gas, uranium, and other key exports. Nations such as China and India, which account for around 70% of Russia’s energy trade, would be the main targets.Senator Graham called it “the most draconian bill I’ve ever seen in my life in the Senate.”He said, “The world has a lot of cards to play against Putin,"" adding, ""We’re going to hit China and India for propping up his war machine.”Both senators expressed concern over the slow progress in peace talks, scheduled to resume on Monday in Istanbul. Ukrainian officials say Moscow has yet to put forward any serious proposals, a delay the senators described as a calculated stalling tactic by Putin to buy time for a new offensive.“Putin is playing President Trump,” Blumenthal said bluntly. “He’s taking him for a sucker.” He added, “He’s stalling and stonewalling to mount this offensive and seize more territory.”Graham agreed, warning, “We saw credible evidence of a summer or early fall invasion, a new offensive by Putin. ... He’s preparing for more war.”Despite the urgent calls, US President Donald Trump has yet to back the sanctions bill, saying, “I don’t know. I’ll have to see it.” Graham noted the legislation was drafted with input from Trump’s advisers and praised his diplomatic instincts, but said, “It’s become painfully clear he’s not interested in ending this war.”The senators hope their direct encounters with the devastation in Ukraine will sway opinions in Washington. “He needs to see and hear that message as well from us, from the American people,” Blumenthal said.Their visit also laid bare the grim human cost of the conflict. Graham highlighted estimates that nearly 20,000 Ukrainian children have been forcibly deported to Russia, calling their return “a matter of justice, not diplomacy.” Blumenthal spoke of visiting mass graves in Bucha, where civilians were executed at close range. “Putin is a thug. He’s a murderer,” he said.Both men warned that failure to act now could pull the US deeper into the conflict. “If Putin is not stopped, Nato treaty obligations could force American troops into battle,” Blumenthal cautioned.Following a meeting with Macron, both senators expressed confidence that Europe is ready to strengthen its stance. “President Macron has shown moral clarity,” Blumenthal said. “He is 100% aligned with the message we’re taking back to Washington.”As Ukraine’s military leaders prepare to brief Congress, a vote on the sanctions bill could soon follow. Graham concluded, ""President Trump said we’ll know in two weeks whether he’s being strung along.""""There will be more evidence from Russia on Monday.”","Two senior US senators warn that Russian President Vladimir Putin is deliberately delaying peace negotiations while gearing up for a fresh military offensive in Ukraine.

We've got to be ready







WASHINGTON: A logjam in the trade talks between the United States and China could be broken once Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping speak, US officials said Sunday a conversation they said could happen soon.Trump on Friday accused Beijing of violating a deal reached last month in Geneva to temporarily lower staggeringly high tariffs the world's two biggest economies had imposed on each other, in a pause to last 90 days.China's slow-walking on export license approvals for rare earths and other elements needed to make cars and chips have fueled US frustration, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday a concern since confirmed by US officials.But US treasury secretary Scott Bessent seemed to take the pressure down a notch on Sunday, telling CBS's ""Face the Nation"" that the gaps could soon be bridged.""I'm confident that when President Trump and Party chairman Xi have a call that this will be ironed out,"" Bessent said, however noting that China was ""withholding some of the products that they agreed to release during our agreement.""When asked if rare earths were one of those products, Bessent said, ""Yes.""""Maybe it's a glitch in the Chinese system. Maybe it's intentional. We'll see after the president speaks with"" Xi, he said.On when a Trump-Xi call could take place, Bessent said: ""I believe we will see something very soon.""Kevin Hassett, director of the White House's national economic council told ABC that the call could happen ""this week"" but that he had no confirmation of a scheduled time.Since Trump returned to the presidency, he has slapped sweeping tariffs on most US trading partners, with especially high rates on Chinese imports.New tit-for-tat levies on both sides reached three digits before the de-escalation this month, where Washington agreed to temporarily reduce additional tariffs on Chinese imports from 145 percent to 30 percent.China, meanwhile, lowered its added duties from 125 percent to 10 percent.Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick told ""Fox News Sunday"" that China was ""slow-rolling the deal,"" adding: ""We are taking certain actions to show them what it feels like on the other side of that equation.""""Our president understands what to do. He's going to go work it out,"" Lutnick said.Lutnick also said that a US court battle over Trump's tariff strategy one court's ruling to block the tariffs has been stayed pending an appeal would ultimately end with a win for the president.""Tariffs are not going away,"" Lutnick said.Separate from the China deal, Trump said Friday he would double sector-specific tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50 percent starting June 4 sparking ire from the European Union, which said it would retaliate.Hassett said China's dumping of low-cost steel was hurting US industry which in turn was hindering US military preparedness.""The bottom line is that we've got to be ready in case things don't happen the way we want, because if we have cannons but not cannonballs, then we can't fight a war,"" Hassett told ""This Week.""""And if we don't have steel, then the US isn't ready, and we're not preparing ourselves for something,"" he added.""We have to have a steel industry that's ready for American defense.""","US treasury secretary Scott Bessent seemed to take the pressure down a notch on Sunday, telling CBS's ""Face the Nation"" that the gaps could soon be bridged.
