The accused, a 27-year-old driver with a ride-hailing company, throttled his 21-year-old wife following frequent quarrels over family disputes.To hide the crime, he had cut the body into pieces with a hexa blade. He threw the head, hands, and legs into the Musi river at Prathapsingaram, and kept the trunk without the head and legs in his room, DCP (Malkajgiri Zone) P V Padmaja told reporters.The accused packed the body parts separately in plastic covers and made three trips to the river to dump them. Later, he called his sister claiming his wife had gone missing. When his sister grew suspicious and informed a relative, he was taken to a police station, PTI reported.He again tried to portray the murder as a missing incident, but during questioning he confessed to killing his wife, the DCP said.A case has been registered under relevant BNS sections for murder and causing disappearance of evidence, and the accused is now in custody.The remains were recovered from the house and sent for post-mortem.“We have to ascertain the deceased (is wife of the accused) and a DNA test will be conducted,” Padmaja added.Asked about the recovery of the missing body parts, she said teams of NDRF personnel and GHMC swimmers have launched searches, but nothing has been found so far.Police revealed that both the accused and the victim were from Vikarabad district and had been neighbours before marrying through a love-cum-arrange marriage in January 2024 at Arya Samaj. They moved to Hyderabad and lived in a rented house in Boduppal.However, after a month of living together, disputes began.In April 2024, the woman lodged a complaint of domestic violence with Vikarabad police, following which a case was registered. Elders later intervened and the matter was settled in a village panchayat.The woman briefly worked at a call centre in Punjagutta but was forced to quit by her husband, who suspected her movements. She became pregnant in March 2025, but quarrels continued.On August 22, she told her husband she wanted to visit Vikarabad for a medical check-up and then stay with her parents. He refused, an argument broke out, and she abused him. On the same day, police said, the man decided to kill her.The investigation is ongoing.","Five-month pregnant woman was allegedly killed by her husband in Hyderabad.

From the top, he shouted for a woman named Khushbu and insisted she be brought to the site or he would jump.""Despite repeated attempts to locate the woman, police found no trace of her. Eventually, they had a female staff member pose as Khushbu over the phone, which successfully persuaded Pandey to descend from the tower around 2 pm.Further investigation revealed that Pandey had been communicating for two years with someone using a fake Instagram profile. Authorities said that the person behind the account had used a woman’s photograph to gain Pandey’s trust and allegedly obtained money from him under the pretext of a romantic relationship.""Pandey told us he wanted to marry Khushbu and believed people were trying to keep them apart,"" Mishra explained.

'SC Inciting Religious Wars': Nishikant Dubey EXPLODES On Supreme Court Over Waqf Scrutiny

NEW DELHI: After focusing for decades on ensuring fair trial to accused persons and their unfettered right to appeal against conviction, Supreme Court in a significant interpretation of criminal law has conferred similar rights on victims of crime, and even their legal heirs, to challenge acquittals.Till now, in the case of acquittal of an accused by trial court or high court, either the state or complainant had the right to file an appeal. A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and K V Viswanathan last week extended the right to appeal against acquittal of accused to two more categories of people - those who suffered injury or losses in the crime and legal heirs of victims of the crime.Writing the 58-page precedent-setting judgment, Justice Nagarathna said, ""The right of a victim of a crime must be placed on par with the right of an accused who has suffered a conviction, who, as a matter of right, can prefer an appeal under Section 374 of CrPC (Code of Criminal Procedure).""""We find the victim has every right to prefer an appeal as against a conviction for a lesser offence or for imposing inadequate compensation or even in the case of an acquittal ...as stated in the proviso to Sec 372 of CrPC,"" the bench said.Threading analogous SC judgments and law commission reports, the bench concluded that the right of victims of crime to file appeal in a higher court against acquittal of the accused, or award of lenient punishment ""cannot be circumscribed"".The bench expanded the ambit of ""victims of crime"" for the purpose of filing an appeal and said their legal heirs could continue prosecution of such appeals in case the appellant-victim dies during the pendency of appeals.Also read - Treaty binds Russia to provide information on woman’s whereabouts: SC ""A person convicted of a crime has the right to prefer an appeal under Section 374 of the CrPC as a matter of right and not being subjected to any conditions. Similarly, a victim of a crime, whatever be the nature of the crime, must have a right to prefer an appeal as per the CrPC,"" she said. Justices Nagarathna and Viswanathan said if the victims of an offence had the right to appeal against acquittal or lesser punishment awarded to the accused, then their legal heirs would have identical right to prosecute the appeal if after filing of the appeal, the injured person dies.SC said in the event of acquittal of accused, the state through the public prosecutor can file an appeal with permission of the appellate court even if the complainant does not challenge the acquittal.""It is not always that the State or a complainant would prefer an appeal. But when it comes to a victim's right to prefer an appeal, the insistence on seeking special leave to appeal from the HC under Section 378(4) of the CrPC would be contrary to what has been intended by the Parliament by insertion of the proviso to Section 372 of the CrPC,"" it further said. ""Hence, the statutory rigours for filing of an appeal by the State or by a complainant against an order of acquittal cannot be read into the proviso to Section 372 of the CrPC so as to restrict the right of a victim to file an appeal on the grounds mentioned therein, when none exists,"" SC said.","Justices B V Nagarathna and K V Viswanathan last week extended the right to appeal against acquittal of accused to two more categories of people. The bench expanded the ambit of ""victims of crime"" for the purpose of filing an appeal and said their legal heirs could continue prosecution of such appeals in case the appellant-victim dies.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123490281,imgsize-921445,width-400,resizemode-4/123490281.jpg"

The University of South Carolina has given the all-clear after a shelter-in-place order on Sunday evening over reports of a possible active shooter near the Thomas Cooper Library. Officials later confirmed there was no evidence of a gunman, and the alert was issued out of “an abundance of caution.”The first Carolina Alert went out shortly after 6:45 pm (local time), instructing students to evacuate the library area, seek shelter, and barricade themselves if necessary. It described the suspect as a white male, about six feet tall, in black pants, with the stark message, “Defend yourself if you encounter the suspect. Obey public safety officials’ commands.”According to news agency AP, university spokesman Jeff Stensland said law enforcement swept the library floor by floor to ensure safety, noting that “the original alert was sent out of an abundance of caution.” He confirmed two students sustained minor injuries during the evacuation process.Later, the university declared the situation resolved. “ALL CLEAR. ALL CLEAR.There is no ongoing emergency at this time; you no longer need to shelter in place. The Thomas Cooper Library building remains closed until further notice. Public safety officials are on the scene,” the alert read.The scare was likely sparked by a video circulated online that claimed to show the alleged shooter carrying a long rifle. In reality, the man appeared to be holding an umbrella while wearing black shorts, a green shirt, white shoes, and a backpack.Social media quickly picked up the clip, with some students questioning why such alerts keep recurring. Others later mocked the panic by sharing a pic of the smiling alleged “University of South Carolina Umbrella Guy.”As per Newsweek, EMS treated a small number of students for minor injuries during the evacuation.The episode follows a spate of similar scares on US campuses. Just days earlier, Villanova University and the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga both experienced false active-shooter reports that led to panic and lockdowns.In Pennsylvania, a 911 caller falsely reported a shooter at Villanova’s law school; in Tennessee, authorities lifted a lockdown after confirming no evidence of a threat.The University of South Carolina, located in Columbia, is home to nearly 38,000 students in a city of about 145,000.","The University of South Carolina issued a shelter-in-place order on Sunday evening over reports of a possible active shooter near the Thomas Cooper Library.

Who is Aunjaneya Kumar Singh? IAS officer who took on Azam Khan repatriated to Sikkim after serving for a decade in UP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/ias-officer-who-took-on-azam-repatriated-to-sikkim-after-serving-for-a-decade-in-up/articleshow/123476937.cms,"Aunjaneya Kumar Singh, known for his strict actions against Azam Khan, has been repatriated to his home cadre, Sikkim, after a decade in Uttar Pradesh. His tenure in UP was marked by controversies, including actions against Khan that led to the SP leader's disqualification from the Assembly.

LUCKNOW: Aunjaneya Kumar Singh, former district magistrate of Rampur who made headlines for taking action against Samajwadi Party veteran Azam Khan, has been repatriated to his home cadre, Sikkim, after serving in Uttar Pradesh for a decade.The state govt had reportedly requested another extension for Singh who had originally come to UP on deputation from 2015 to 2020.The officer was serving as the divisional commissioner of Moradabad, and after his term expired on Aug 14, 2025, he went on leave. On Saturday, it became clear that Singh will have to return to his parent cadre.Known as a tough officer, Singh's tenure in UP was riddled with controversies. In 2019, when he was the district magistrate of Rampur, SP's Azam Khan, riled by strict enforcement of election rules by Singh, said during an election rally that he would get his shoes cleaned by the DM after the election.The subsequent action against Khan and his family, including a report on his son Abdullah Khan, resulted in Khan losing his membership of the UP Assembly. Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav had raised questions on Singh's role in action against Azam, his apparent closeness to the BJP, and his subsequent extensions. Ironically, Singh came to UP when Yadav was the chief minister.Singh was later promoted to divisional commissioner of Moradabad, which covers Rampur and Sambhal districts, the latter of which threw up the next big controversy.When communal violence rocked Sambhal in Nov 2024 following a court-mandated survey of a mosque, which some claimed was built over a temple, Akhilesh and Singh traded poetic jibes over social media.When Singh was given extension just before the 2024 Lok Sabha election, Akhilesh openly questioned the decision and challenged it before the Election Commission on the grounds that it was against service rules.When Singh came to UP in 2015 on interstate deputation, he was first appointed special secretary of irrigation and water resources. In July 2016, he was transferred to Bulandshahr as district magistrate.In April 2017, he was made additional commissioner, commercial tax, followed by a tenure as district magistrate of Fatehpur and then of Rampur. In March 2021, he was appointed divisional commissioner of Moradabad.","Aunjaneya Kumar Singh repatriated to his home cadre, Sikkim, after a decade in Uttar Pradesh.

A holidaymaker from North Carolina turned the tables on a group of suspected pickpockets in Venice after her purse and passport were stolen, dramatically grabbing one teenager by the ponytail until police arrived.Footage of the incident, shared on TikTok by the woman’s daughter Karis McElroy, shows her mother clutching the 14-year-old suspect by the hair as crowds gathered around. “I have eight kids, you’re not getting to me,” the woman is heard saying as the girl screamed.The video has since gone viral on social media.According to Karis, her mother and stepfather realised something was wrong after they were jostled on a narrow bridge while walking to their Airbnb. Her backpack had been unzipped and a purse containing cash, credit cards, AirPods, a passport, and even a metal water bottle was missing. Using the “Find My Friends” feature linked to her AirPods, they tracked the stolen bag to three girls nearby.“She goes and chases them down, and she grabs one of the girls by her ponytail and does not let go. Two of the girls stay, one of the girls runs away with my mom’s purse,” Karis explained in a follow-up video.As per Fox 11 Los Angeles, the confrontation escalated when one of the teenagers swung the stolen bag at the tourist, hitting her in the head. The water bottle inside caused a deep gash, leaving her bleeding and with a black eye. She was later treated in hospital and required stitches.Italian newspaper Il Messaggero reported that the 14-year-old held by the ponytail was arrested but released on bail just two days later.Another girl who fled was eventually stopped at an airport, where police recovered the tourist’s passport and credit cards, though her cash and AirPods were not returned, reported the New York Post.Despite the ordeal, Karis said her mother praised the kindness of Venetians, mentioning that their Airbnb host stood by her during the confrontation and a nearby jeweller even gifted her a necklace after the attack.The couple, who were beginning a Mediterranean cruise from Venice, have continued their trip. “She didn’t care about the other stuff in the bag, but she just at least wanted her passport so she could get home,” Karis said.","US tourist grabs thief by ponytail after getting pickpocketed in Venice.

Moscow says Kyiv has struck a nuclear power plant as Ukraine marks Independence Day,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/moscow-says-kyiv-has-struck-a-nuclear-power-plant-as-ukraine-marks-independence-day/articleshow/123492027.cms,"



Russia accused Ukraine on Sunday of launching drone attacks that sparked a fire at a nuclear power plant in its western Kursk region overnight, as Ukraine celebrated 34 years since its independence.Russian officials said several power and energy facilities were targeted in the overnight strikes. The fire at the nuclear facility was quickly extinguished with no injuries reported, according to the plant's press service on Telegram. While the attack damaged a transformer, radiation levels remained within normal ranges.The United Nations' nuclear watchdog said it was aware of media reports that a transformer at the plants had caught fire ""due to military activity,"" but hadn't received independent confirmation. It said its director-general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, said that ""every nuclear facility must be protected at all times.""Ukraine did not immediately comment on the alleged attack.Firefighters also responded to a blaze at the port of Ust-Luga in Russia's Leningrad region, home to a major fuel export terminal. The regional governor said approximately 10 Ukrainian drones were shot down, with debris igniting the fire.Russia's Defense Ministry claimed its air defenses intercepted 95 Ukrainian drones over Russian territory overnight into Sunday.Russia fired 72 drones and decoys, along with a cruise missile, into Ukraine overnight into Sunday, Ukraine's air force said. Of these, 48 drones were shot down or jammed.Another wartime Independence Day The incidents occurred as Ukraine marked Independence Day, commemorating its 1991 declaration of independence from the Soviet Union. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy delivered remarks in a video address from Kyiv's Independence Square, emphasizing the nation's resolve.""We are building a Ukraine that will have enough strength and power to live in security and peace,"" Zelenskyy said, calling for a ""just peace.""""What our future will be is up to us alone,"" he said, in a nod to the U.S.-Russia summit in Alaska earlier in August, which many feared would leave Ukrainian and European interests sidelined.""And the world knows this. And the world respects this. It respects Ukraine. It perceives Ukraine as an equal,"" he said.U.S. special envoy Keith Kellogg was in attendance at Independence Day celebrations in Kyiv, during which Zelenskyy awarded him the Ukrainian Order of Merit, of the 1st degree.Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney arrived in Kyiv on Sunday morning for meetings with Zelenskyy.""On this special day - Ukraine's Independence Day - it is especially important for us to feel the support of our friends. And Canada has always stood by our side,"" wrote Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy's chief of staff.Military aid and prayers for peace In a joint news conference with Zelenskyy, Carney said Canada will invest 2 billion Canadian dollars ($1.5 billion) in new military assistance for Ukraine to boost its army and provide urgently needed weapons.Zelenskyy said the two leaders were considering the presence of Canadian forces on the ground in Ukraine as part of a reassurance force.Norway announced significant new military aid Sunday, pledging about 7 billion kroner ($695 million) for air defense systems. Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store said Norway and Germany are jointly funding two Patriot systems, including missiles, with Norway also helping procure air defense radar.Pope Leo XIV prayed Sunday for peace in Ukraine as he marked the country's Independence Day with a special appeal during his weekly noon blessing. He said the faithful were joining Ukrainians ""asking that the Lord give peace to their martyred country.""Leo also sent a telegram to Zelenskyy, which the Ukrainian leader posted on X along with similar notes from other world leaders.In the letter, Leo assured his prayers for all Ukrainians who are suffering, and wrote: ""I implore the Lord to move the hearts of people of good will, that the clamor of arms may fall silent and give way to dialogue, opening the path to peace for the good of all.""A war of attrition Meanwhile, Russia's troops continued their push in eastern and northern Ukraine, where Russia claimed Saturday that its forces had seized two villages in the Donetsk region. The Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine's Defense Ministry said Sunday that Ukraine had taken back control of the village of Novomykhailivka, also in the Donetsk region.Russia's Defense Ministry said Sunday that 146 Russian servicemen had been returned from Ukraine, in exchange for the same number of Ukrainian servicemen. The ministry said the latest exchange also included eight residents of Russia's Kursk region, which was subject to a surprise Ukrainian incursion in August 2024, who were returned to Russia after being held in Ukraine.Shortly after the Russian announcement, Zelenskyy said ""our people are coming home."" He said that those being exchanged included members of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the National Guard, the State Border Guard Service and civilians. ""Most of them had been in captivity since 2022,"" he said.Zelenskyy did not confirm the number of prisoners involved in the exchange.","Russia says its air defenses intercepted 95 Ukrainian drones over Russian territory.

Anti-semitism row: Paris summons US ambassador Charles Kushner; slams ‘unacceptable’ allegations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/antisemitism-row-paris-summons-us-ambassador-slams-unacceptable-allegations/articleshow/123491877.cms,"File photo: French President Emmanuel Macron (left) and American ambassador in Paris, Charles Kushner (Picture credit: AP)





France has summoned the American ambassador in Paris, Charles Kushner, after he accused President Emmanuel Macron ’s government of failing to act strongly enough against antisemitism.The French foreign ministry said in a statement on Sunday that Kushner’s allegations were “unacceptable” and that he had been called to appear at the ministry for Europe and foreign affairs on Monday.“France firmly rejects these allegations,” the ministry added, stressing that French authorities were “fully mobilised” to tackle antisemitic acts which it called “intolerable.” According to news agency AP, the ministry also warned that Kushner’s intervention violated the Vienna Convention by interfering in the internal affairs of another country.Kushner, a real-estate developer and father of Jared Kushner, who is married to US President Donald Trump’s daughter Ivanka, had published the remarks in a letter to Macron carried by the Wall Street Journal.In it, he alleged that antisemitism in France had “exploded” since the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 and the subsequent war in Gaza. “In France, not a day passes without Jews assaulted in the street, synagogues or schools defaced, or Jewish-owned businesses vandalised,” Kushner wrote, urging Macron to enforce hate-crime laws more vigorously and to soften criticism of Israel.According to news agency Reuters, he also tied the surge in antisemitic incidents to France’s plan to recognise a Palestinian state, arguing that such moves embolden extremists.As per BBC, Kushner’s claims echoed comments made earlier by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had also accused Macron of fuelling antisemitism through his stance on Palestinian statehood. Macron, however, has argued that recognising Palestine is essential for long-term peace and has simultaneously increased security at synagogues and Jewish centres.The episode comes at a sensitive time in Franco-American relations. According to AP, both governments have clashed recently over trade disputes, the future of UN peacekeepers in Lebanon, and their approaches to the war in Ukraine.Still, Macron held what was described as a “warm” meeting with Trump and other European leaders in Washington last week.France is home to Western Europe’s largest Jewish community, estimated at around 500,000 people, as well as a large Muslim population. Both groups have reported a rise in hate crimes since the Gaza conflict began, with the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory claiming more than 60,000 people have been killed in Israeli strikes, according to BBC.The White House has not commented on the row, but state department spokesperson Tommy Pigott defended Kushner on Sunday and was quoted by AP as saying, “Ambassador Kushner is our US government representative in France and is doing a great job advancing our national interests in that role”.","Charles Kushner accused French government of failing to act strongly enough against antisemitism.

The Post





Mingus Lucien Reedus, 25, son of actor Norman Reedus and supermodel Helena Christensen , was arrested in Manhattan on Saturday morning over an alleged assault, the New York Post reported.Reedus allegedly punched a 33-year-old woman to wake her up before choking her and slamming her to the ground inside a Chelsea apartment, police sources toldThe incident began when Reedus himself dialed 911 around 8:40 am (local time), reporting that a woman at the West 16th Street apartment was taking pills and threatening suicide. Responding officers were told by the woman that Reedus had attacked her. She was taken to Bellevue Hospital in stable condition, while Reedus was taken into custody.The 25-year-old, wearing green shorts, a black t-shirt and handcuffs, was photographed being led out by officers around 9:25 am. He has been charged with assault in the third degree and criminal obstruction of breathing, NYPD said.Reedus was then escorted out of the 10th Precinct into a police vehicle.Asked by reporters why he had called police, he replied, “I didn’t.” Reedus later called it “a misunderstanding.” A woman identifying herself as his girlfriend also described the episode as “a big misunderstanding.”This is not Reedus’ first brush with the law. In 2022, he accepted a plea deal over a 2021 incident at the San Gennaro Festival in Little Italy, where he allegedly punched a woman in the face.","Mingus Lucien Reedus, 25, son of actor Norman Reedus and supermodel Helena Christensen, was arrested in Manhattan on Saturday morning over an alleged assault.

Molten fury in Hawaii: Kilauea volcano erupts again with lava fountains soaring 100 feet; 31st eruption since December,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/molten-fury-in-hawaii-kilauea-volcano-erupts-again-with-fountains-soaring-100-feet-31st-eruption-since-december/articleshow/123469221.cms,"Kilauea volcano spews lava in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Hawaii.

Mount Kilauea erupts again as Hawaii volcano shoots lava for 31st time since December





Hawaii’s Kilauea volcano roared back to life on Friday, hurling arcs of lava nearly 100 feet (30 metres) into the sky from its summit crater, in what marked the 31st eruption episode since December 2024.The activity began with steady spattering from a northern vent before lava overflowed onto the crater floor and later surged into towering fountains by the afternoon. According to news agency AP, officials confirmed the outburst was restricted to the summit, with no homes at risk.For those inside Hawai‘i Volcanoes National Park, the spectacle offered a front-row seat. Volunteer photographer Janice Wei described the sound as “a roaring jet engine or crashing ocean waves” and admitted she could still feel the heat from over a mile away.“Every eruption feels like I am sitting in the front row at nature’s most extraordinary show,” she was quoted as saying by AP.Scientists at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory explained that magma is rising at a rate of nearly 3.8 cubic metres per second, inflating underground chambers until pressure forces molten rock above ground.“It’s like a Champagne bottle being uncorked,” said scientist-in-charge Ken Hon as cited by AP, who noted that the same conduit has been carrying magma to the surface since December.Some eruptions have sent jets soaring more than 1,000 feet, though recent fountains appear shorter as the vent has widened. “We’re still gonna have spectacular eruptions,” said Steve Lundblad, a geology professor at the University of Hawaii at Hilo, adding that “they’re just going to be wider and not as high”.The event also holds deep cultural resonance. Native Hawaiian practitioner Huihui Kanahele-Mossman, who leads the Edith Kanakaʻole Foundation, said lava flows are not just destructive but the very land on which Hawaiians live.Linking eruptions to the goddess Pele, she performs chants and presents offerings such as awa and fern lei at the crater. “To be able to actually see that eruption that’s described in the mele, that’s always exciting to us and motivates us to stay in this tradition,” she explained.Tourism has already surged, with park visitation in April rising 49% compared with the same month last year. Authorities, however, urge caution, unstable cliffs, volcanic gases and ash remain serious hazards.Park spokesperson Jessica Ferracane advised visitors to sign up for USGS alerts, noting many episodes last only 10–12 hours.Kilauea, one of the planet’s most active volcanoes, has followed this explosive pattern only four times in the past two centuries, with notable eruptions in 1959, 1969 and a prolonged series that began in 1983.Scientists say it’s uncertain how long the current eruption will last. “Our job is like being a bunch of ants crawling on an elephant trying to figure out how the elephant works,” Hon remarked.","Hawaii's Kilauea volcano erupted on Friday, hurling arcs of lava nearly 100 feet (30 metres) into the sky from its summit crater.

"Harvard making changes Trump officials want, even without a deal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/harvard-making-changes-trump-officials-want-even-without-a-deal/articleshow/123492058.cms,"



Early in the spring, an aggressive and polarizing new presidential administration drafted a menu of demands, many of them very specific, designed to reshape the culture at Harvard, the nation's richest university.With billions of dollars in research funds in jeopardy, the university's leaders are now negotiating with the White House. But an eventual deal may not fully capture the changes, small and large, already enacted at Harvard before any papers are signed.The university has recoiled at some of the sweeping changes the Trump administration demanded. Harvard's president, Dr. Alan M. Garber, has singled out several as intrusive and unconstitutional, including demands that might influence whom the university hires and admits.But it has also taken a host of steps that align with the White House's desires, checking off items on the administration's detailed menu, which have ranged from eliminating diversity offices to ousting program leaders.President Donald Trump and his appointees have made their attack on Harvard a totem for the changes they want to see across America's elite universities, using the government's blunt power to force compliance in a manner never before seen.The Trump administration's demands included eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion programs. In April, Harvard renamed its Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging, which is now called the Office for Community and Campus Life. More recently, Harvard also took down websites for its Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, as well as websites for companion offices for gay and female students, and said they were merging them into a new, single center.The government has also sought leadership shake-ups in certain departments, including the Center for Middle Eastern Studies, after Jewish alumni and others accused the programs of sponsoring antisemitic programming. Harvard removed two of the center's leaders, including Cemal Kafadar, a leading Turkish scholar, in March.And Trump officials asked for an end to Harvard's partnership with Birzeit University, a top Palestinian college in the West Bank. Harvard said it had suspended the relationship and had struck up new ones with institutions in Israel.The university has announced some of the changes, arguing that they were needed to make the campus more welcoming and more open to different viewpoints. But Kirsten Weld, a Harvard history professor, says that while the university says it is independently adopting measures that mirror some of the White House demands, that's a slippery contention.","The university has recoiled at some of the sweeping changes the Trump administration demanded.

US immigrant population drops for first time in decades: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-immigrant-population-drops-for-first-time-in-decades-report/articleshow/123491953.cms,"



For the first time in decades, more immigrants are leaving the US than arriving, a new study finds, an early indication that President Trump's hard-line immigration agenda is leading people to depart - whether through deportation or by choice. An analysis of new census data released last week by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center found that between Jan and June, the foreign-born population in the US - both lawful and unlawful residents - declined by nearly 1.5 million. In June, the country was home to 51.9 million immigrants, down from 53.3 million six months earlier.Officials from the Trump administration have applauded the net outflow, asserting that pressures on govt services have eased and that job markets have rebounded. And some supporters of the immigration crackdown say it hasn't gone far enough.But experts predict looming negative economic and demographic consequences for the US if the trend persists. Immigrants are a crucial workforce in many sectors, and the country's reliance on them is growing as more baby boomers retire.Lillian Divina Leite, 46, chose to use govt's new self-deportation program to return to Brazil. A housekeeper in Charlotte, North Carolina, Leite said that she had begun to panic when she saw immigrants being ""hunted down like hardened criminals.""""I got really scared,"" said Leite, who had fallen out of legal status after overstaying a six-month tourist visa. ""I thought, I haven't done anything wrong in my life,"" she said, ""and suddenly I could be imprisoned. ""Despite the study's findings, Kevin Lynn, executive director of the Institute for Sound Public Policy, which advocates for less immigration, said that foreign workers who enter lawfully continue to pour into the United States and undermine Americans. ""There has been no letup,"" he said. ""People coming here legally, whether on green cards or employment visas, are impacting American workers at all strata, whether low-skilled or high-skilled. ""Net migration - the difference between the number of immigrants arriving and departing - has turned negative, a shift that the chief Pew demographer, Jeffrey Passel, called a ""demographic certainty"" so far in 2025. His team's analysis did not calculate a separate number for immigrants without lawful status who seem likely to represent the largest number of departures, because heightened enforcement probably diminished immigrants' participation in the census survey that was used to make estimates, he said. They may have been under-counted, which would suggest the drop is not as severe, or their low participation could mask an even more striking decline. The US experienced negative net immigration in the 1930s, during the Great Depression. ""A rapid decline in immigration is going to cause economic harm,"" said Tara Watson, an economist at the Brookings Institution and one of the authors of the report. Political pushback and legal challenges could lead the Trump administration to ease its crackdown and, thus, soften the impact, she said.","Net migration - the difference between the number of immigrants arriving and departing - has turned negative.

An American Airlines flight from Philadelphia to Phoenix was forced to make an emergency landing on Saturday, after a passenger's electronic device caught fire mid-air, causing smoke inside the cabin.Flight 357, carrying 160 passengers and six crew members, landed safely at Washington Dulles International Airport around 11:50 a.m., where it was met by emergency responders, according to the US federal aviation administration (FAA). The exact device that caused the fire has not been disclosed, reported ABC news.American Airlines confirmed the incident in a statement: “The device was quickly contained by crew members prior to landing.”Passenger Adriana Novello, 22, told the news portal that she woke up to a flight attendant rushing for the fire extinguisher. “Then I started smelling smoke, and a lot of people on the plane were coughing,” she said. “But I looked behind me, and what we could tell was that there was something on fire in the aisle.”As smartphones and portable chargers have become more common, the number of in-flight fires caused by these devices has gone up sharply.In February, the FAA said such incidents have increased by 388% over the last 10 years.Several similar incidents have occurred recently. Earlier this year, a power bank caught fire on a Batik Airlines flight from Malaysia to Bangkok, filling the cabin with smoke. A comparable event occurred during an AirAsia flight in Thailand last winter.In light of these risks, the US transportation security administration (TSA) has recently updated its “don’t pack” list. Newly restricted items include gas-powered curling irons and flat irons, as well as gas refills, though corded versions remain allowed in luggage.All passengers and crew on the American Airlines flight were safe, and the flight was rescheduled after the incident.","Flight 357, carrying 160 passengers and six crew members, landed safely at Washington Dulles International Airport around 11:50 a.m. The exact device that caused the fire has not been disclosed. In February, the FAA said such incidents have increased by 388% over the last 10 years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123488700,imgsize-1115258,width-400,resizemode-4/123488700.jpg"

'Trump A Threat To New York': Zohran Mamdani Challenges U.S. President On Takeover By National Guard





US President Donald Trump has warned that he may send federal troops to Baltimore, sharply criticising Maryland Governor Wes Moore’s handling of crime in the city.The statement, posted on Sunday on his Truth Social platform, follows similar threats made by him regarding New York City, and Chicago, this week.Responding to a recent challenge by Governor Moore to ""walk the streets of Maryland"" with him, Trump wrote: “I assume he is talking about out of control, crime ridden, Baltimore? As President, I would much prefer that he clean up this crime disaster before I go there for a ‘walk’.”Accusing Moore of having a poor crime record, Trump added, “If Wes Moore needs help, like Gavin Newscum did in LA, I will send in the ‘troops,’ which is being done in nearby DC, and quickly clean up the Crime.” Trump referred to California Governor Gavin Newsom as “Gavin Newscum,” a derogatory twist he has often used in past posts.Trump, who recently claimed credit for a reported drop in crime in Washington DC following increased federal presence, warned that similar action could be taken in Baltimore if conditions persist.“After only one week, there is NO CRIME AND NO MURDER IN DC! When it is like that in Baltimore, I will proudly ‘walk the streets’ with the failing, because of Crime, Governor of Maryland,” he stated.In the same post, Trump also referred to a federal contribution made to support reconstruction efforts after the collapse of Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key bridge earlier this year, suggesting he may “rethink that decision.”“Baltimore is ranked the 4th WORST CITY IN THE NATION IN CRIME & MURDER. Stop talking and get to work, Wes. I’ll then see you on the streets!!!” Trump concluded.The post adds to a series of recent assertions by Trump where he has threatened to intervene directly in Democrat-led cities to address crime, marking a continuation of his “law and order” messaging ahead of the 2026 midterms.","US President Donald Trump has warned that he may send federal troops to Baltimore.

Gerrymandering face-off: Hakeem Jeffries hits back at GOP; says ready for redistricting push in blue states,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/gerrymandering-face-off-hakeem-jeffries-hits-back-at-gop-says-ready-for-redistricting-push-in-blue-states/articleshow/123486187.cms,"Hakeem Jeffries (AP)





US House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on Sunday said Democrats are prepared to expand gerrymandering efforts in blue states in response to Republican redistricting moves being encouraged by President Donald Trump, reported news portal Politico.Speaking to CNN’s State of the Union, Jeffries said Democrats have already acted in California after Texas Republicans approved a new congressional map that could give them five additional seats in next year’s midterms.“Right now, this has happened in Texas. California has responded,” Jeffries said. “Let’s see what comes next,” as quoted by the portal.The redistricting developments signal a fresh phase of partisan map-drawing battles, with Texas Republicans acting on Trump’s push for GOP-led states like Indiana and Missouri to secure more seats through mid-decade redraws.In California, Democratic governor Gavin Newsom is leading efforts to add five new seats, with a special election likely in the fall for voter approval.Jeffries hinted that if Republicans escalate their redistricting strategy, Democrats could follow suit in other blue states. However, some states present institutional hurdles. New York, for example, has an independent redistricting commission that cannot be overhauled until 2027, limiting immediate options for Democrats there.Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, also seen as a potential 2028 contender, has little room to expand as the current map already heavily favours Democrats, who hold 14 of the state’s 17 seats.Despite the redistricting standoff, Jeffries downplayed concerns about Republican gains, citing the 2018 midterms when Democrats flipped 41 seats during Trump’s presidency.“As Democrats, we’re going to focus as well on fixing our broken health care system and cleaning up corruption,” Jeffries said. “So we have an affirmative agenda that is compelling that we will continue to present to the American people. The Republicans have failed. That is why they are running scared.”",US House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Democrats are prepared to expand gerrymandering efforts in blue states in response to Republican redistricting moves.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Big Op Sindoor Lie Claims India Begged For Ceasefire, Trump Stepped In





ISLAMABAD: Nearly 100 days after Indian fighter jets pounded “terror bases” in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), local police said they have arrested a man who allegedly passed on the GPS coordinates of a mosque that was among those hit.The May 6 raids had left the Bilal Mosque in Muzaffarabad badly damaged, with three fatalities reported. Now, PoK police say Obaid Jahangir of Rawalakot “sold out” by sharing its exact GPS location with India over WhatsApp, allegedly for money.Obaid has been booked under the draconian Official Secrets Act, 1923, with police claiming they had recovered “hard evidence” of espionage. “He passed on sensitive images and the mosque’s coordinates in exchange for hefty payments,” claimed SSP Riaz Mughal of PoK police’s counter-terrorism department (CTD).But the case is already mired in conflicting narratives. Another senior CTD officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, went further, alleging Jahangir had a past with a banned outfit before joining a so-called relief organisation. Investigators, he added, had traced communications with Indian handlers on his phone.The family, however, insists Obaid is no militant. His uncle admitted the 30-something may have “fallen into a money trap” but stressed he was only associated with the Jammu Kashmir United Movement, a relief body.“If he is guilty, he should face the law, but he has never been part of any militant outfit,” the uncle maintained.His lawyer, Abdul Samad, pointed out that the sections invoked against him cover trespassing into restricted areas and passing on information “prejudicial to national security”. Conviction under these clauses carries punishments ranging from 14 years in prison to life.Earlier this year, too, PoK police had arrested a police constable on charges of selling sensitive information across the border.","Indian fighter jets pounded ‘terror bases’ in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) Nearly 100 days later, local police said they have arrested a man who allegedly passed on the GPS coordinates of a mosque.

Pakistan blaze: Fireworks warehouse explosion injures at least 25; fire triggers road closures in Karachi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-blaze-fireworks-warehouse-explosion-injures-at-least-25-fire-triggers-road-closures-in-karachi/articleshow/123434002.cms,"



At least 25 people, including some in critical condition, were injured after an explosion took place at a fireworks storage facility in Karachi, Pakistan.Thick smoke could be seen billowing into the sky from the building where firecrackers were stored, according to television footage.Witnesses cited by AP said that broken glass from nearby shops covered the road and panicked residents fled the scene.Firefighters rushed to extinguish the blaze while ambulances ferried the injured, including passers-by, to hospitals.Senior police official Asad Raza said several shops and vehicles on Jinnah Road were damaged in the blast. The cause of the explosion was not immediately known.The fire was reported in a warehouse near Taj Complex on MA Jinnah Road, a Rescue 1122 spokesperson said, adding,“as soon as Rescue 1122’s Central Command and Control team received the information, the Fire and Rescue team reached the scene along with an ambulance and two fire brigade trucks.”Police surgeon Summaiya Syed told Dawn, “Sixteen injured at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre [with] two critical. Fourteen at Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Trauma Centre,” adding that the warehouse had been storing firecrackers.Karachi traffic police said MA Jinnah Road had been closed due to the fire, with traffic from Numaish being diverted towards Society Signal and Ali Raza Imambargah.Citizens were advised to call the Traffic Police helpline at 1915 for alternate routes “to avoid inconvenience,” the Dawn reported.Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and directed officials to control the blaze and ensure no lives were lost. According to a statement, he also ordered the Karachi Commissioner to provide immediate medical assistance to the injured and submit a detailed report. “There is no permission to produce materials near cities or populated areas which can cause damage,” CM Murad was quoted as saying.The Sindh home ministry later issued a statement saying 20 people had been injured in the blaze.Home minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar directed police reinforcements to the scene, saying, “Police reinforcements should be sent to rescue the injured and transfer them quickly to the nearest hospital. An investigation must be completed and a report submitted soon.”Lanjar also instructed investigators to include statements from the injured and evidence from the scene, Dawn furthed added.Explosions at fireworks facilities are not uncommon in Pakistan. In January, six people were killed in a similar blast at a fireworks storage site in Mandi Bahauddin, Punjab province. Fires in commercial and residential buildings are also frequent, largely blamed on poor infrastructure, weak enforcement of safety rules, and negligence.","At least 25 people, including some in critical condition, injured after explosion at fireworks storage facility in Karachi, Pakistan.

Targeting Ahmadiyya community



Blasphemy accusations







The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has raised alarm over violence against minority communities in the country.HRCP on Thursday released its latest report, Streets of Fear: Freedom of Religion or Belief in 2024/25, documenting violations of freedom of religion or belief (FORB) between 1 July 2024 and 30 June 2025.The report painted a picture as grim as in previous years, recording targeted killings, forced conversions, mob lynchings, hate speech, desecration of places of worship and extrajudicial killings. It also warned that religious freedom in Pakistan is facing an unprecedented threat.The HRCP highlighted several cases where individuals were killed over blasphemy accusations, describing the trend as deeply troubling in a country that has already witnessed the assassination of a provincial governor by his own security guard.The HRCP report noted that the pattern of minor non-Muslim girls disappearing and later resurfacing after allegedly converting to Islam and marrying Muslim men persisted in 2024/25.Hindus in Sindh, who form 8.8% of the population, and Christians in Punjab (1.9%), have raised repeated concerns. A fact-finding study found that forced conversions and coerced marriages remain most prevalent among Scheduled Caste Hindus due to poverty and limited social mobility.The report highlighted the role of cleric-politician Mian Abdul Haq, or Mian Mithu, accused of using his influence to facilitate conversions at his seminary in Ghotki. He was sanctioned by the UK in 2022.The report also cited cases where police were seen siding with abductors, often claiming it would be “haram” to return a girl after conversion.In July 2024, Faisalabad police recovered Christian minor Laiba Suhail, abducted in February and forcibly converted before being married off illegally. Another girl, Alina, is still missing. In January 2025, a Mirpurkhas court heard a plea from a couple accused of forcing an underage Hindu girl to convert and marry.Other cases were reported across provinces: in April 2025, 14-year-old a Hindu girl, Chahat disappeared in Quetta and later claimed in a video to have converted, though her parents produced documents proving she was underage.In May, Hindu Panchayats in Ghotki and Rohri protested the disappearance of a Meghwar teenager in Rohri, fearing abduction for forced conversion. In June, civil society groups and Hindu Panchayats in Larkana expressed concern over three minor girls and a teenage boy from Shahdadpur allegedly being forced to convert.The HRCP stressed that such cases continue to deepen insecurity among religious minorities and called for protective measures to safeguard vulnerable children and their families.The report listed multiple killings of Ahmadis: dentist Zakaur Rahman in Lalamusa (July 2024), Tayyab Ahmad in Rawalpindi (December 2024), Amir Hasan in Naukot (December 2024), Laeeq Cheema lynched in Karachi (April 2025), Muhammad Asif in Kasur (April 2025), and senior doctor Mahmood Sheikh in Sargodha (May 2025).The UN warned, “We are alarmed by ongoing reports of violence and discrimination against the Ahmadiyya community in Pakistan.”“According to the data provided by the Ahmadiyya community, 29 Ahmadi places of worship were attacked and damaged during the review period,” the report said.It further added that in 26 cases, the demolition was carried out by law enforcement agencies.“These incidents occurred in Okara, Khanewal, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Vehari, Sheikhupura, Gujrat, and Sargodha, among other locations Back in January, a historic Sialkot site linked to Pakistan’s first foreign minister Zafarullah Khan was “reduced to rubble”.The report said that the blasphemy law has been often misused to settle personal scores or seek financial gain in Pakistan, where, a ‘mere accusation of blasphemy can be a death sentence.’In September, last year, two men accused of blasphemy were killed while in police custody less than a week apart. One was inexplicably shot and killed in Mirpurkhas during an alleged police encounter, and the other was killed by a police constable inside a police station in Quetta.On 12 September 2024, constable Saad Khan Sarhadi shot dead Abdul Ali, a blasphemy suspect, inside Quetta’s Cantonment Police Station after mobs from religious parties gathered outside demanding his custody. It marked the first such incident in the city where a serving officer killed a suspect in custody. Days later, Ali’s family pardoned Sarhadi, while lawyers and a JUI-F senator pledged legal support for him.Later, on 17 September 2024, Shahnawaz Kunbhar, a civil hospital employee from Umerkot, fled to Karachi after a cleric accused him of posting blasphemous content. He denied the charge in a video message before being arrested by police, who assured his family of protection. Two days later, police claimed he was killed in an encounter, with officers celebrated as heroes.His family was prevented from burying him by armed mobs, and the body was desecrated. Following outrage from rights groups, a Sindh police inquiry declared the encounter “fake.”The report also showed that the mainstream media largely ignored issues of religious freedom under the period covered. Even the Islamabad High Court’s hearings into the “blasphemy business group,” affecting nearly 400 households and livestreamed for four months, drew little coverage. Likewise, cases of coerced marriages, forced conversions and violence against minorities rarely made headlines.A worrying trend has emerged in Pakistan, where ultra-right-wing groups are exerting growing pressure on the judiciary and elected officials through propaganda and intimidation, it added.","The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has raised alarm over violence against minority communities in the country.

’14 Pakistani Soldiers Killed’: Baloch Rebels Attack Day After India’s Strike On Terror Hubs | Watch





The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for an attack in Panjgur that left four Pakistan 's army personnel dead. According to BLA spokesperson Jeeyand Baloch, fighters launched a raid in the Surdu area of Panjgur on Tuesday night, eliminating a key operative of the Pakistan army.The statement revealed that Ghulam Sarwar had earlier established and commanded a so-called death squad under the protection of the Pakistani military. This squad, which had been active for years in Gichek and other parts of Panjgur, was later led by his son, Islam Sarwar. The group allegedly supported the army's operations, carrying out targeted killings, enforced disappearances, and other violent acts. In return, the army reportedly allowed them to freely engage in drug trafficking, kidnappings for ransom and extortion through road checkpoints.During the operation, BLA fighters seized three Kalashnikov rifles, an M-4, additional weapons, two vehicles, and three motorcycles from Islam Sarwar's hideout. The site, according to the BLA, also served as a torture chamber, where electric shock devices and other tools of abuse were found. Islam Sarwar was accused of abducting and killing a young man in Panjgur just two months earlier. Jeeyand Baloch warned that the Pakistani army and its allies would be held accountable for crimes against the Baloch people.The BLA's latest offensive is part of the ongoing insurgency in Balochistan , where separatist groups are demanding greater autonomy and recognition of Baloch rights. In recent years, attacks on military and paramilitary forces, along with government facilities, have intensified.Separatist factions argue that the Baloch people face systemic marginalisation and exploitation, despite the province's wealth in natural resources. In response, Pakistan's military has pursued counterinsurgency campaigns to suppress the rebellion. However, human rights groups have repeatedly raised concerns over reports of forced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and excessive force during these operations.Numerous accounts point to the widespread issue of disappearances, with civilians and activists allegedly detained without due legal process. Rights organisations argue that such tactics fuel fear and deepen mistrust, further straining relations between the Pakistani state and the Baloch population.","Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for an attack in Panjgur that left four Pakistan's army personnel dead.

Maryam Riaz Wattoo, sister of former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan ’s wife Bushra Bibi, has alleged that Bushra was forced to go on a hunger strike in prison before she was allowed to meet her family, ARY News reported.Both Bushra and Imran are behind bars facing multiple cases of corruption. Since his arrest in 2023, Khan has consistently maintained his innocence, asserting that the charges were fabricated by his opponents to prevent his political comeback.Maryam further claimed that Bushra was being kept in “difficult and unlawful” conditions.

DHAKA: Pakistan on Sunday claimed it had twice settled the issue of the 1971 Liberation War genocide committed by the Pakistan army in which more than a million civilians were butchered.Visiting foreign minister of Pakistan, Ishaq Dar said the massacre of Bangla-speaking people in what then was eastern Pakistan and rapes of lakhs of women was settled twice in 1974 and early 2000s.The assertion generated shock because there is no evidence of Pakistan officially apologising for the crimes committed by its army, and was seen as an evidence of its resolve to achieve normalisation of ties on its own terms.Significantly, the Bangladesh interim govt did not specifically address Dar's claim, limiting itself to saying ""we have agreed"" to resolve the issue in the course of time."" There was no indication it was still insisting on an official apology which for decades was set as the minimum pre-requisite for starting the process of reconciliation. For Bangladesh, the other issues of concern are return of assets Pakistan seized after Bangladesh became an independent country, repatriation of stranded Pakistanis, and transfer of foreign aid meant for the 1970 cyclone victims.""On the matter of unresolved issues, what I want to say is that the first settlement took place in 1974,"" said Dar, who arrived in Dhaka on Saturday for a visit aimed at rebuilding ties with Bangladesh following the ouster of PM Sheikh Hasina, whose father led the struggle for independence and who was a hardliner on the issue of official apology. ""General Pervez Musharraf came here and resolved the issue openly. As a result, the issue was resolved twice. Once in 1974, and again in the early 2000s,"" he said.Bangladesh foreign affairs adviser Md Touhid Hossain said all ""unresolved"" issues were raised with Dar. ""We have agreed to resolve them to advance our bilateral relations further,"" Touhid told reporters after meeting Dar, who is the most senior leader from his country to visit Dhaka since 2012, after then Pakistan foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar. ""The issues accumulated over 54 years cannot be solved overnight. But we have agreed to address them over the due course of time,"" he added.Dar said Pakistan will provide advanced medical treatment, including limb replacement for 40 individuals, including students, injured during the ""July Uprising"" - the movement that led to Awami League govt's ouster last year.He also called on chief adviser Muhammad Yunus and their discussion covered revival of old connections between the two countries, promoting youth linkages, enhancing connectivity, and augmenting trade and economic cooperation, according to Pakistan's ministry of foreign affairs.Bangladesh foreign affairs ministry said, ""The meeting took place in a spirit of warmth and goodwill, reflecting the brotherly relations between the countries and their shared desire to augmenting engagement and cooperation.""",Pakistan claims it has settled issue of 1971 Liberation War genocide.

Sri Lanka’s Ex-President Ranil Wickremesinghe Arrested Over Alleged Misuse Of State Funds





Sri Lanka's jailed former president, Ranil Wickremesinghe, was admitted to the intensive care unit at Colombo National Hospital on Saturday, a day after being charged with misusing government funds for foreign travel.The deputy director-general of hospital Rukshan Bellana said that Wickremesinghe was reportedly severely dehydrated and required close monitoring. The 76-years-old ex-president was remanded in custody on Friday night.""He has to be closely observed and treated for acute dehydration to prevent serious complications,"" Bellana said. ""He was a severe diabetic with high blood pressure when he was brought in.""Bellana added that the former president's condition was ""stable.""A prison official said that Wickremesinghe was taken to Sri Lanka's main state-run hospital as his condition deteriorated and the prison medical facility was not equipped to treat him, as reported by news agency AFP.Earlier, opposition lawmakers visiting Wickremesinghe in prison reported that he remained in good spirits. Opposition parties have accused the government of detaining him out of fear he could return to power.Wickremesinghe, who lost the presidential election in September to Anura Kumara Dissanayake , has remained politically active despite holding no official position.He was arrested on Friday as part of President Dissanayake’s campaign against corruption in Sri Lanka, which is recovering from its worst economic crisis in 2022.Nalin Bandara, an opposition MP from Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) party said Wickremesinghe urged unity to challenge the current government. ""What the former president says is that we should get onto a common stage to fight the oppression of the new government,"" Bandara said.The former Sri Lankan leader United National Party (UNP) also said the government acted out of fear of his political influence. UNP General Secretary Thalatha Athukorala told reporters, ""They fear he might return to power, and that is why this action.""Wickremesinghe is accused of using state funds for a private trip to Britain in September 2023 while returning from the G77 summit in Havana and the UN General Assembly in New York.The alleged offences carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a fine up to three times the misappropriated amount, estimated at 16.6 million rupees ($55,000).His two-day trip to the UK was to attend the conferral of an honorary professorship on his wife, Maithree, by the University of Wolverhampton. Wickremesinghe has maintained that his wife covered all travel expenses and that no state funds were used.Wickremesinghe became president in July 2022 after Gotabaya Rajapaksa resigned following months of street protests triggered by the country’s economic crisis.",Sri Lanka’s Ex-President Ranil Wickremesinghe Arrested Over Alleged Misuse Of State Funds.

(AP





CHEMMANI: A baby bottle, a squeaky toy and a schoolbag are among items that have surfaced from a mass grave site in Sri Lanka's formerly war-torn northern region, along with 141 human skeletons including some that appear to be of children of different ages.The findings were made at a cremation ground in the Chemmani area near Jaffna town, the cultural heartland of the country's ethnic Tamil minority. But hardly any burials take place here, as Hindus mostly cremate their dead according to religious customs.Excavations have been underway since June, after workers found human remains while digging to build an electric crematorium.A pit test over nine days discovered 19 sets of human remains. Shallow burials of about 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) in a scattered and disorganized manner, and the absence of clothing, indicated the site was a mass grave, according to a report provided to a court in June.Since the area was secured and declared a crime scene that month, a total of 141 skeletons have been discovered within a 165-square-meter (1,776-square-foot) area. About 135 of the bodies had no clothing, and only one set of adult clothing was identified.Tests confirmed that a skeleton found with a schoolbag was that of a girl between 4 and 6 years old. Toddlers' dresses, socks and footwear, tiny bead bangles and a baby powder tray were also recovered.The identities of the dead and the cause and timing of their deaths are all unclear. But many think the victims could be civilians who disappeared during Sri Lanka's civil war, which broke out in 1983 between government forces and ethnic Tamil rebels, who fought to create an independent homeland for the minority group. The war ended in 2009.Several Tamil armed groups and an Indian peacekeeping mission were active in the region over the decades. But attention has focused on the Sri Lankan military, which had a heavy presence for over a decade in Chemmani, as the gateway to Jaffna town.Decades-old confession heightens suspicions A confession made by an army soldier before he was sentenced to death for rape and murder 27 years ago has strengthened suspicions about the site.In 1998, Somaratne Rajapakse along with four alleged accomplices from the military and police were sentenced to death for the gang rape and murder of a schoolgirl and the killing of her mother, brother and a neighbor.The five, who weren't hanged and remain in prison due to a moratorium on executions, have maintained that they were not involved in the rape and murder, but only disposed of the bodies under orders.Rajapakse told the court that he knew where up to 400 bodies were buried in Chammani.""We cannot say exactly who the perpetrators are yet, but the finger points to the (state) army,"" said Brito Fernando, an activist working with the families of people who disappeared during various armed conflicts in Sri Lanka.The area, including the cremation ground, were under Sri Lankan military control from 1996, when it captured Jaffna from the rebels, until after the war ended in 2009. The military operated checkpoints, and anyone who entered or left the area was searched.In 1999, Rajapakse led police to a spot where the schoolgirl, her family and the neighbor were buried and later showed police other places where more remains were found. But the investigations were abruptly stopped.Families want closure Items found at the site were publicly displayed earlier this month in the hope that their owners would be identified, and many people from surrounding villages and beyond visited the site.Amalanathan Mary Calista, whose husband has been missing since 1996 when the military arrested him in their village, said she hoped seeing proof that her husband was dead would bring a sense of closure.""I went there hoping to see at least his clothes. There was a sarong (clothing that wraps around the waist) but it wasn't my husband's. He was wearing a blue sarong at the time. It was disappointing,"" she said.""I only saw the clothing of little children,"" she added, as she wept.She said her husband is among 24 people who never returned home after the military searched their village. Families had tried to block the army vehicles from taking away the detained people, but the authorities pushed them aside with guns and the vehicles sped away, she said.""My wish is that he should be alive and return, but we can do nothing if it is not so,"" she said.""The state army arrested him. They must say that they arrested him and that he died at their hands. They also must pay us compensation,"" she said.Woman recalls military taking her brother and husband away Sivanathan Selvamalar said she watched her younger brother being loaded into a military truck blindfolded during that same raid. Years later, in 2009, her husband was also detained at a checkpoint. He called her to tell her of his arrest and was not heard from again.""We went to see the things, thinking they may have buried people who were arrested around this area, but we saw only the things of little children,"" she said.""We have checked all the prisons but have not found them. When we are told that more than 100 skeletons have been dug out, we fear the worst,"" she added.No children listed in missing person reports A 2003 report by Sri Lanka's Human Rights Commission said it investigated 281 complaints of missing persons from 1990 to 1998. Of these, three were found in prisons and later released, while the rest are still unaccounted for. The report said the military was responsible for 243 cases, while the Tamil Tiger rebels were responsible for 25. The responsibility for 10 others is unknown.No children were listed as missing.Nadesapillai Vithyatharan, the editor of the only newspaper in the region at the time, said several families returned to Jaffna after fleeing into rebel-held territory as the military moved in. Some reportedly went missing after being stopped at checkpoints set up to look for infiltrating rebels, he said.Calls for DNA analysis Although previous investigations stalled, there is hope now that victims will be identified, Fernando said. But he said the government must do more to conduct a credible investigation.""We don't have proper guidelines to investigate the mass graves and have no DNA bank to help with identification,"" said Fernando, adding that the government should fund a DNA bank and enlist international support in the identification of victims.""Only a proper investigation by the government can free its military from suspicion,"" he said.Any direct probe into the military would likely anger Sri Lankan nationalists. Many of the majority ethnic Sinhalese admire the military for winning the civil war.Excavations will continue for 8 more weeks Ground-penetrating radar in other parts of the cremation ground has shown ""soil anomalies ... that are indicative of comparable density of buried skeletal remains,"" according to a report submitted in the Jaffna court last week.The scanned area is three times larger than the site that has been excavated, said Ranitha Gnanarajah, a lawyer monitoring the process. Investigators have requested court approval to continue excavations for eight more weeks, she said.Army spokesman Brig. Waruna Gamage said no one has formally accused the army of responsibility for the mass grave, and if they did they would need to show proof, he said.""The excavations are still ongoing and it is a civil matter belonging to the police and courts,"" Gamage said. ""We will respect the law of the country.""Government forces and the rebels are both accused of committing atrocities amounting to war crimes in the months leading to the end of the civil war in 2009.","A baby bottle, a squeaky toy and a schoolbag are among items that have surfaced from a mass grave site in Sri Lanka's formerly war-torn northern region.

A United Nations-backed investigator has revealed disturbing evidence of “systemic torture” inside Myanmar’s detention centres, describing electric shocks, strangulations, gang rape and the burning of sexual body parts among the abuses that were documented over the past year.Nicholas Koumjian, head of the international independent team investigating atrocities in the country, spoke as the group released its latest annual report on Tuesday, covering the 12 months to 30 June.The country has been in turmoil since February 2021, ever since the army overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi’s elected government, sparking a civil war. As peaceful protests were crushed with lethal force, those opposing military rule took up arms.Since then, conflict has engulfed large parts of Myanmar.The investigative team, as quoted by AP, said that it had made progress in identifying security personnel involved in detention operations, as well as “perpetrators who have summarily executed captured combatants or civilians accused of being informers.”These perpetrators included members of the security forces, affiliated militias and opposition armed groups.The report details the ""documented torture in Myanmar’s detention facilities which includes beatings, electric shocks, strangulations, gang rape, burning of sexual body parts and other forms of sexual violence,"" according to a summary of the findings.“Our report highlights a continued increase in the frequency and brutality of atrocities committed in Myanmar,” Koumjian said. “We are working towards the day when the perpetrators will have to answer for their actions in a court of law.”“We have uncovered significant evidence, including eyewitness testimony, showing systematic torture in Myanmar detention facilities,” he further added.The team also launched new investigations into atrocities committed in Rakhine state, where the military and the Arakan Army, an opposition force, are battling for control.Rakhine has long been the scene of grave abuses. More than 700,000 people from the Rohingya minority fled to neighbouring Bangladesh in 2017 to escape persecution. About 70,000 more crossed the border last year after the Arakan Army effectively seized control of the territory.The Independent Investigative Mechanism on Myanmar has been operating since 2018 under a mandate from the UN-backed Human Rights Council to document human rights abuses and violations in the country.It has already shared evidence with authorities pursuing cases involving the Rohingya at the International Criminal Court and the UN’s International Court of Justice.","U.N.-backed team releases annual report covering the 12 months to 30 June.
