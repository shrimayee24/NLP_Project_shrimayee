NEW DELHI: A statement by one of the top functionaries of Canadian Security Intelligence Service ( CSIS ) about Pakistan ’s involvement in stoking pro-Khalistan movement in Canada has deepened doubts about the motives of the powers-that-be in Ottawa.Venessa Llyod, interim director of CSIS, appeared before Foreign Interference Commission in Sept and was asked by the commission’s lead counsel Shantona Chaudhury about this.Lloyd said, “Pakistan’s engagement is consistently in balance with trying to reduce the influence of India... Influence of Pakistan is directly related to support of Khalistani extremism .”Lloyd’s testimony ties in with India’s long-standing grouse that Khalistani extremists who have found shelter in Canada have been enlisted by Pakistan in its campaign against India. “You don’t have to take our word. This is what your own security and intelligence tzarina has to say. She has no dog in this fight,” said a senior govt source who spoke on the condition of anonymity.“Why are they not outraged over this?” he asked, a remark that reflected the suspicion in official circles that Canadian PM Justin Trudeau , in escalating the disagreement between the two countries to near-breaking point, has been motivated by considerations other than “concocted” transgressions of Ottawa’s sovereignty.","Venessa Llyod, interim director of CSIS, appeared before Foreign Interference Commission in Sept. “Pakistan’s engagement is consistently in balance with trying to reduce the influence of India...

TOI Correspondent from LONDON: Straight after a huge diplomatic crisis engulfed India and Canada on Monday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sought support from Britain, one of its Five Eyes allies.Trudeau rang UK PM Keir Starmer in the evening to discuss what he described as a “targeted campaign against Canadian citizens by agents linked to the govt of India”.Trudeau said the leaders discussed the need to ensure the safety and security of their citizens and the importance of upholding and respecting the rule of law and that he underscored Canada’s “continued interest in cooperation with India”. The No. 10 statement on the call, which was more reserved, said they spoke about “allegations” under investigation in Canada and “agreed on the importance of the rule of law”.Dabinderjit Singh, lead executive for political engagement at the pro-Khalistan Sikh Federation UK, said the allegations against India should be a “wake-up call to the UK govt, the other Five Eyes nations and countries across the globe” and called on other countries to “show the same courage and political will to stand shoulder to shoulder with Canada”.When news of the crisis broke, a newly formed Sikh Federation International was busy briefing 10 UK MPs and Baroness Warsi on the transnational repression of Sikhs in a committee room in the UK Parliament. The meeting was chaired by Labour MP Preet Kaur Gill.The barrister representing Avtar Singh Khanda's family, Michal Polak, was at the meeting, as were two Canadian Sikhs from Sikh Federation Canada — Moninder Singh, who is giving evidence about India to the ongoing public inquiry in Canada into foreign interference in the electoral process, and Prabjot Singh, the lead advocate representing Sikhs at that inquiry. Moninder has received multiple threat to life warnings in Canada.The Canadian activists informed the parliamentarians that “the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh leader, on Canadian soil and India’s arrogance that they could get literally get away with murder had resulted in the political will in Canada to expose India on the international stage for having no respect for the rule of law and Canada’s sovereignty”. Nijjar was designated a terrorist by India.Polak told them he is calling for an inquest and a public inquiry into Khanda’s death. Khanda was a close friend of Amritpal Singh and a leading Khalistan activist in the UK. His family and friends are convinced he was poisoned by India’s govt.Next, the US-based Sikhs for Justice, which is banned in India and is organising an unofficial Khalistan referendum, announced it had allocated a $500,000 budget to “track” the ex-high commissioner of India to Canada, Sanjay Verma, “in pursuit of bringing him to justice” for his alleged role in the “assassination” of Nijjar.The MEA on Monday withdrew Verma and other targeted diplomats and officials from Canada, after they were named as “persons of interest” in Nijjar’s murder by Canada’s govt. The MEA said their lives had been endangered and branded the allegations “preposterous”.The flare-up in relations came after deputy commissioner of federal policing Mark Flynn travelled to Singapore with Canadian national security and intelligence adviser Nathalie Drouin and deputy minister of foreign affairs David Morrison to present what Canada described as “evidence” of the Indian govt’s involvement in “serious criminal activity in Canada” to govt officials from India on Oct 12.The meeting did not go as planned and the RCMP said that because India would not cooperate it decided to go public.At a press briefing, RCMP assistant commissioner Brigitte Gauvin then made astonishing allegations that a “number of criminal gangs” were working for the Indian govt in Canada and one of them is the Lawrence Bishnoi gang, originating in India, to carry out extortions, threats, homicides and other acts of violence. “There is specific targetingof pro-Khalistan elementsin Canada,” Gauvin alleged.She said Canadian police had around a dozen police investigations ongoing “with links to the govt of India” and around 30 individuals had been arrested and charged with extortion and homicides. Since Sept 2023, 13 people in Canada have received duty to warn notices, she said, adding RCMP had shared this information with the FBI and other Five Eyes allies.","Canadian PM Justin Trudeau sought support from Britain, one of its Five Eyes allies.

This exchange marked Harris's first interview on Fox, quickly turning into a back-and-forth as Baier pressed her on whether she had any ""concerns"" about the President's mental health.When questioned about Biden’s cognitive abilities, Harris was unequivocal in her support.“Joe Biden, I have watched from the Oval Office to the Situation Room, and he has the judgement and experience to do exactly what he has done in making very important decisions on behalf of the American people,” she stated firmly. When Baier inquired if any concerns had been raised regarding Biden’s mental faculties, Harris responded, “Joe Biden is not on the ballot.”Despite Baier referencing remarks from public figures like George Clooney, who suggested Biden’s performance was lacking, Harris maintained her defense. “I think the American people have a concern about Donald Trump , which is why the people who know him best, including leaders of our national security community, have all spoken out,” she said, shifting the focus to Trump’s perceived instability. “He’s not stable,” Harris added.The discussion quickly became heated as Baier pressed Harris on various policy issues, including immigration and her shifting stances since her 2020 presidential bid.Harris also used the interview to distance herself from the notion that her presidency would be a mere continuation of Biden’s. “My presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden’s presidency,” she declared, saying that that she would bring “fresh and new ideas” to the White House. While she did not outline specific differences, Harris made clear that her administration would turn a new page, reflecting her own experiences and leadership approach.","Vice President Kamala Harris faced tough questions during a heated interview with Fox News’ Bret Baier, particularly regarding President Joe Biden ’s mental fitness.

"Trump, at Latino event, stands by false claims of immigrants eating pets",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-at-latino-event-stands-by-false-claims-of-immigrants-eating-pets/articleshow/114298375.cms,"US former president Donald Trump

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Wednesday stood by debunked claims that immigrants in Ohio were eating pets, telling Latino voters during a town hall he was ""just saying what was reported.""Trump in recent weeks has amplified a false claim that has gone viral that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were stealing residents' pets or taking wildlife from parks for food.There have been no credible reports of Haitians eating pets, and officials in Ohio - including Republicans - have repeatedly said the story is untrue.At a town hall hosted by Spanish-language TV Univision , an undecided Mexican-born Latino Republican voter from Arizona, a battleground state, asked Trump in Spanish whether he truly believed that immigrants were eating pets.""I was just saying what was reported... And eating other things too that they're not supposed to be. All I do is report,"" Trump replied during the event held in Miami. ""I was there, I'm going to be there and we're going to take a look.""Trump added that ""newspapers"" had also reported on the claim, without naming any or providing any details.Trump, who has not yet traveled to Springfield, has previously said he would conduct mass deportations of Haitian immigrants from the Ohio city, even though the majority of them are in the U.S. legally.The city has faced bomb threats since Trump began repeating the false accusations about Haitians.In the final weeks before the Nov. 5 election, Trump is increasingly resorting to darker and more violent language about illegal immigration, an issue that opinion polls show resonates with many voters, especially Republicans.He is competing against Democratic candidate Kamala Harris for key votes from the growing Latino population. Latino voters have typically backed Democrats, but the Trump campaign is hoping to win over more of them, especially men, on the back of economic discontent.Harris led Trump by eight percentage points - 47% to 39% - among Hispanic voters in Reuters/Ipsos polling conducted between Sept. 11 and Oct. 7. Harris held her own Latino town hall last week in Nevada, a battleground state with a significant Hispanic population.Farm worker questions TrumpAt the town hall, Trump was asked another immigration question by a Mexican-born California farm worker, who spoke of picking strawberries and broccoli for years. He asked who would do hard farm labor if Trump goes through with his plans to deport millions of people who are in the United States illegally, and how that would impact food prices.Trump dodged the question, instead claiming that African Americans and Hispanic Americans were losing their jobs because of illegal immigration. He also repeated baseless claims that Latin American countries were emptying out mental institutions and jails to send people to the United States.Trump has previously used dehumanizing terminology to describe immigrants in the U.S. illegally, calling them ""animals"" when talking about alleged criminal acts, and saying they are ""poisoning the blood of our country,"" a phrase that has drawn criticism as xenophobic and echoing Nazi rhetoric.","Donald Trump tells Latino voters he was ""just saying what was reported"" Trump has amplified a false claim that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating pets.

Mexico's ex-public security chief sentenced to 38-plus years in US for taking cartel bribes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/mexicos-ex-public-security-chief-sentenced-to-38-plus-years-in-us-for-taking-cartel-bribes/articleshow/114298017.cms,"Mexico's Genaro Garcia Luna speaks during a ceremony to designate June 2 as Federal Police Day in Mexico City, June 2, 2011. (AP)

NEW YORK: The man once heralded as the architect of Mexico 's war on drug cartels was sentenced to more than 38 years in a US prison on Wednesday for taking massive bribes to aid drug traffickers.Genaro Garcia Luna , Mexico's former secretary of public security, was convicted by a New York jury in 2023 of taking millions of dollars in bribes to protect the violent Sinaloa cartel that he was supposedly combating.He is the highest-level Mexican government official to be convicted in the United States.At his sentencing hearing before a federal judge in Brooklyn on Wednesday, Garcia Luna continued to maintain his innocence and said the case against him was based on false information from criminals and the Mexican government.""I have a firm respect for the law,"" he said in Spanish. ""I have not committed these crimes.""Garcia Luna, 56, led Mexico's federal police before he served in a cabinet-level position as the top security official from 2006 to 2012 under then-President Felipe Calderon. At the time, Garcia Luna was hailed as an ally by the US in its fight on drug trafficking But US prosecutors said that in return for millions of dollars, he provided intelligence about investigations against the cartel, information about rival gangs and the safe passage of massive quantities of drugs.After the sentencing, Calderon said via the social platform X that he respects the court's decision but he never had ""verifiable evidence"" of Garcia Luna's criminal activities. Calderon said taking on the cartels ""was one of the most difficult decisions of my life. But I would do it again, because it is the right thing to do.""Earlier outside the courthouse, a group of about 15 protesters celebrated the verdict. Some held a banner that said, in Spanish, ""Calderon did know,"" while others brandished signs denouncing his political party.Prosecutors had asked for a life sentence. Garcia Luna's lawyers had argued that he should get no more than 20 years.US District Judge Brian Cogan said he wasn't moved by past accolades that Garcia Luna received for his work in the war on drugs.""That was your cover,"" Cogan said before imposing the sentence. ""You are guilty of these crimes, sir. You can't parade these words and say, 'I'm police officer of the year.'""Besides the sentence of 38 years and four months, the judge imposed a $2 million fine.During the trial, photos were shown of Garcia Luna shaking hands with former President Barack Obama and speaking with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former Sen. John McCain.But prosecutors said Garcia Luna secretly advanced a drug trafficking conspiracy that resulted in the deaths of thousands of American and Mexican citizens. He ensured that drug traffickers were notified in advance of raids and sabotaged legitimate police operations aimed at apprehending cartel leaders, they said.Drug traffickers were able to ship over 1 million kilograms of cocaine through Mexico and into the United States using planes, trains, trucks and submarines while Garcia Luna held his posts, prosecutors said.During former Sinaloa kingpin Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman's trial in the same court in 2018, a former cartel member testified that he personally delivered at least $6 million in payoffs to Garcia Luna and that cartel members agreed to pool up to $50 million to pay for his protection.""He enabled the cartel. He protected the cartel. He was the cartel,"" Assistant US Attorney Saritha Komatireddy told the judge Wednesday.Garcia Luna enabled a corrupt system that allowed violent cartels to thrive and distribute drugs that killed multitudes of people, she added.""It may not have been the defendant pulling the trigger, but he has blood on his hands,"" Komatireddy said.Prosecutors also said Garcia Luna plotted to undo last year's verdict by seeking to bribe or corruptly convince multiple inmates at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn to support false allegations that two government witnesses communicated via contraband cellular phones in advance of the trial.Garcia Luna's lawyer, Cesar de Castro, said the defense intends to appeal the sentence. He said his client is someone who ""has served his country"" and has now lost his money, his reputation as well as policies he championed in Mexico.""He has lost close to everything. All that remains is his wonderful family,"" de Castro said.In Mexico, newly inaugurated President Claudia Sheinbaum briefly commented on the case Tuesday, saying: ""The big issue here is how someone who was awarded by United States agencies, who ex-President Calderon said wonderful things about his security secretary, today is prisoner in the United States because it's shown that he was tied to drug trafficking.""Garcia Luna's arrest and conviction became a political cudgel that the governing party of Sheinbaum and her predecessor, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, used in this year's Mexican presidential election against Calderon's weakened National Action Party. They sought to paint Garcia Luna as the poster child of corruption and Calderon as the man responsible for soaring violence from the drug war.Lopez Obrador and now Sheinbaum turned away from direct confrontation with the cartels, instead focusing on what they consider root causes of violence, such as poverty. But the new strategy has failed to significantly lower the level of violence.Lopez Obrador had a very different reaction in 2020 when US authorities arrested former Mexican Defense Secretary Salvador Cienfuegos for allegedly colluding with a drug cartel. In that case, Lopez Obrador accused the Drug Enforcement Administration of fabricating evidence against Cienfuegos and protested until the US government dropped the charges. He was returned to Mexico, where he was promptly cleared and released.","Genaro Garcia Luna, Mexico's former secretary of public security, was convicted by a New York jury in 2023. He is the highest-level Mexican government official to be convicted in the United States. At the time, Garcia Luna was hailed as an ally by the US in its fight on drug trafficking.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114298046,imgsize-627597,width-400,resizemode-4/114298046.jpg"

MAGA supporters claimed Donald Trump was right about the crime data in ABC News debate

When Donald Trump said during the debate that crime incidents increased in the Joe Biden-Kamala Harris administration, he was fact-checked. MAGA supporters Wednesday said the FBI quietly adjusted its 2022 figures in recent weeks -- after the debate and the new numbers show Trump was right.First reported by RealClearInvestigations (RCI), the new numbers show that the raw number of violent crime incidents — including murders, assaults and rapes — rose to 1,256,671 in 2022 from 1,197,930 in 2021, an increase of 4.9 per cent.In October of 2023, the FBI put out a press release unveiling its national crime data for 2022, which found that “national violent crime decreased an estimated 1.7 per cent in 2022 compared to 2021 estimates.”“I have checked the data on total violent crime from 2004 to 2022,” College of William & Mary economics professor Carl Moody, who specializes in studying crime, told RealClearInvestigations. “There were no revisions from 2004 to 2015, and from 2016 to 2020, there were small changes of less than one percentage point.“The huge changes in 2021 and 2022, especially without an explanation, make it difficult to trust the FBI data ,” Moody added.Elon Musk said even the latest FBI crime data ""massively understates"" the problem.The FBI’s crime stats revisions reveal how much guesswork is involved in even the “final” numbers often seized on by politicians. The FBI doesn’t simply count reported crimes. Instead, it offers estimates by extrapolating data from police departments that report only partial-year data. The Bureau also makes estimates for cities that report no data. The FBI’s method of generating these estimates changes over time, and it affects the figures they report, RCI said."," MAGA supporters said the FBI quietly adjusted its 2022 figures in recent weeks.

It later became one of the adorable names late Prince Philip used for his wife. Meghan Markle told that she was granted permission to use the name 'Lilibet' for their daughter.Harry too maintained that version but it enraged the Queen. Lilibet was born in June 2021, two years after Harry and Meghan left their royal duties and exited the family to settle in the US.Robert Hardman's book 'Charles III: New King, New Court. The Inside Story' revealed that one member of staff claimed that the late Queen was ""as angry as I'd ever seen her"" after hearing Harry and Meghan's comments.The Queen was never asked for her blessing to use the name Lilibet for Harry and Meghan's daughter, a BBC report said but some other reports claimed that when the Queen was contacted by Harry, she was not in a position to say no.The old issue resurfaced as Meghan Markle is on the radar for her growing distance with Prince Harry and speculations are rife that the royal couple may head for a divorce. On professional front too, Meghan is seeing a bad press after her former staff said she is a dictator in high heels. Harry is more focused on his solo charity engagements and Meghan her own. While work is separating them, according to insiders, they are already on a 'trial separation'.When the controversy over Lilibet's name broke out, a spokesperson of Harry and Meghan said they would not have used the name without the late monarch's permission. ""The Duke spoke with his family in advance of the announcement - in fact his grandmother was the first family member he called.

Vice president Kamala Harris Wednesday said Donald Trump 's comment at the townhall of women voters that he is the father of IVG is quite bizarre.

How US picks its president: Decoding the election process,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-us-picks-its-president-decoding-the-election-process/articleshow/114252324.cms,"US vice president Kamala Harris.

Here’s the lowdown on how America elects its head of state.

Who are the main contenders for the 2024 race?

Electoral College

Early voting and mail-in ballots

Vote counting

Swing states

Electing members of Congress

The United States presidential election is a process that goes beyond a simple tally of votes. Voters elect 538 members of the Electoral College , who ultimately choose the president.Most states follow a winner-take-all system, but a few divide their electoral votes proportionally.The outcome often hinges on pivotal swing states, and although early and absentee voting is common, the official result isn’t finalized until Congress certifies the electoral votes.How is the US election winner decided?Sometimes, a candidate wins despite losing the popular vote, and certain states are more crucial than others to clinch a win.The Democratic Party has, US Vice President Kamala Harris succeeded Joe Biden on July 21, leading the ticket. She will turn 60 this month and has chosen Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, 60, as her running mate.Former US President Donald Trump , who is running again at 78 years old, is the Republican Party candidate. Ohio Senator JD Vance, 40, is his vice-presidential candidate.Jill Stein is running for the Green Party, having previously contested in 2012 and 2016, while Chase Oliver is the Libertarian Party’s candidate.And, Robert Kennedy Jr , son of the former attorney general and nephew of US President John F Kennedy , has suspended his independent campaign and endorsed Trump.Stein’s previous runs and the Green Party’s 2020 candidate, Howie Hawkins, reflect the ongoing presence of third-party challengers, though they have yet to pose a serious threat to the two-party dominance in US presidential elections.There are numerous other candidates affiliated with other minor parties or those who are running independently, but do not have majority ballot access.A US voter does not directly vote for president. Instead, voters cast votes for electors in the Electoral College, a body that ultimately chooses the president.There are 538 electors in total, representing 435 members of the House of Representatives , 100 Senators, and 3 electors from Washington DC. The magic number for victory is 270 electoral votes — an absolute majority.Each state’s allocation of electors is proportional to its representation in Congress, so a larger state like California has more electors (55) compared to smaller states like North Dakota (3).The candidate who wins the most votes in a state typically takes all of that state’s electoral votes a system used in 48 states and Washington DC. Maine and Nebraska, however, use a proportional system that can split electoral votes based on district-level and statewide results.The 2020 census altered the distribution of electors by shifting seats in the House of Representatives. For instance, Texas gained two additional seats and now holds 40 electoral votes, while states like California, New York, and Michigan each lost one electoral vote. This redistribution reflects population changes and impacts the electoral weight of different states in upcoming elections.As a result of this system, candidates can lose the popular vote but still win the presidency by securing key electoral votes, as demonstrated in the 2016 election, when Hillary Clinton garnered almost 3 million more votes than Trump but lost in the Electoral College.In 2000, George W Bush won the presidency with 271 electoral votes, while his opponent, Al Gore, won the popular vote by over half a million.Early voting and absentee voting also play a vital role. Although the official election date is November 5, 2024, Americans have a choice to cast their votes weeks in advance through mail-in ballots or in-person early voting.Early voting picked up in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with absentee ballots accounting for 42 per cent of the total votes cast, according to the MIT Election Data + Science Lab. In total, 158 million votes were cast in the 2020 election, with absentee voting reaching a high of 66.4 million — up from 28.8 million in 2016.Trump claimed that absentee voting was “fraudulent,” but research has shown that’s a very rare scenario. In the 2022 mid-term elections, absentee voting fell to 32 per cent, but it continues to remain a crucial voting method for many Americans.Early voting is widely accessible in 47 states, along with territories like Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. In most states, voters do not need a specific reason to cast their votes early, but some states require individuals to request absentee ballots for early voting.Only three states — Alabama, Mississippi, and New Hampshire — do not offer early in-person voting.The earliest set of results is typically known by the end of election night. Polling stations generally close between 6:00 pm and 8:00 pm, with the winner often projected by 11:00 pm Eastern Time.However, the rise in mail-in ballots has led to delays in final results, particularly in swing states where margins are tight. In 2020, for instance, Joe Biden was declared the winner only after multiple days of counting in critical battleground states.Media outlets such as CNN, NBC, and ABC rely on real-time vote counts and exit polls to project winners, while the Associated Press (AP) uses a more conservative approach. The AP employs around 4,000 correspondents across the country and only declares a winner once they are certain that the remaining uncounted ballots will not change the outcome.The final step in the election process occurs in December when the Electoral College formally casts its votes. State governors or secretaries of state certify the results, and on January 6, 2025, Congress will officially count the electoral votes.The newly elected president will be inaugurated on January 20, 2025, marking the start of a four-year term.Swing states play an outsized role in determining the outcome of presidential elections. These states do not have a consistent pattern of voting for one party and can swing either Republican or Democrat in any given election.Key swing states in 2024 are likely to include Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Winning these states is often decisive for candidates due to the significant number of electoral votes at stake.Campaigns pour millions of dollars into advertising and voter outreach in swing states. As of November 2023, Trump was leading in all but Wisconsin, highlighting how competitive these states can be.In addition to presidential votes, voters in many of these states will also be deciding on crucial local issues, including referendums on abortion rights in states like Montana and Arizona.The US presidential election is just one part of the broader voting process. On November 5, 2024, Americans will also elect 468 members of Congress, comprising 33 senators and all 435 members of the House of Representatives.Eleven states and two territories will hold gubernatorial elections, while various local offices and referendums will also be on the ballot. For example, a referendum in Montana will determine whether abortion rights should be enshrined in the state’s constitution.These elections, along with the presidential race, form a dynamic and multifaceted process that reflects the decentralized nature of the US electoral system. Voters play a direct role in shaping not only national leadership but also local and state policies that impact everyday life.","Voters elect 538 members of the Electoral College, who ultimately choose the president.

Like Epstein's list, a list of names, all celebrities, with links to P Diddy and his Freak sessions, are doing the rounds on social media.The alleged list contains names of Leonardo Dicaprio , Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Ashton Kutcher, Paris Hilton, Howard Stern, Russell Brand, Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez, Russell Simmons, Usher, Meghan Fox. The list goes viral as Usher, Pink deleted their X posts and theories that Justin Bieber might have been a victim of Diddy float around.Nobody has been implicated in the Sean Combs case so far.P Diddy is facing serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering where he forced women to have sex with male prostitutes that continued for days as the entire action was caught on camera. Huge stocks of baby oil, drugs were found at Diddy's sex den while Diddy did not plead guilty to the charges.Usher who once stayed with Diddy said his X account got hacked and that's why all his past posts disappeared. This happened as his old statement in which said he witnessed wild things when he stayed with Diddy resurfaced.Apart from Usher and Pink, Megan Fox deleted all her posts on Instagram and X triggering speculations over how she was linked to Diddy.An old snipped of Khloe Kardashian claiming that she attended one of Diddy's naked parties emerged. ""I got on a plane at 5:30 am. Well this party...I think half the people there were butt naked,"" this is exactly what Khloe said about Diddy's party.Diddy was Justin Bieber's mentor but Bieber's spokesperson said he is trying not to focus on the charges and accusation of Diddy. Justin is in a happy bubble since he became a father.As the list of the Hollywood A-listers becomes long, they are maintaining absolute silence over Diddy's arrest.An officer involved in the raid on Diddy's home compared him to Jeffrey Epstein, stating that Diddy was part of the same social circle as Epstein and Harvey Weinstein. The officer claimed there were 15 years of wild parties, suggesting that while not everyone who attended was complicit in trafficking, they witnessed inappropriate behavior. He emphasized that many people knew what went on, especially as things became more explicit late at night.Also read on the Diddy case:","No Hollywood A-lister has been implicated in the Sean Diddy trafficking case but several 'Diddy lists' are viral.

Kamala Harris Fox News Interview: Kamala Harris vows to be different than Joe Biden in fiery Fox interview,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-harris-vows-to-be-different-than-joe-biden-in-fiery-fox-interview/articleshow/114298692.cms,"Harris's first formal interview with Fox News ran for nearly half an hour.

Vice President Kamala Harris sought to deflect criticism over the administration’s handling of the border crisis, her stance on transgender rights and her ties to President Joe Biden in a combative interview Wednesday on Fox News .“Let me be very clear, my presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden’s presidency, and like every new president that comes in to office, I will bring my life experiences, my professional experiences and fresh and new ideas,” Harris said.The Democratic presidential nominee’s first formal interview with the outlet ran for nearly half an hour, capping a day where Harris sought to broaden her appeal to conservative voters with an event in suburban Philadelphia featuring dozens of Republican officials who had endorsed her campaign. The interview between Harris and Fox chief political anchor Bret Baier was frequently testy, with both frequently interrupting and speaking over each other.Baier opened the interview by pressing Harris on immigration , which voters have pegged as one of the defining issues of the election.Harris argued that the administration has taken the issue of immigration seriously and that many of the problems they were facing pre-dated her and Biden taking office, and hit at Trump for his role in blocking a bipartisan bill that would have surged resources to address the border surge.“We’ve had a broken immigration system transcending by the way Donald Trump ’s administration even before. Let’s all be honest about that. I have no pride in saying that this is a perfect immigration system,” she said.The vice president said she and Biden had offered legislation to address the immigration system within hours of taking office.“Our focus has been on fixing a problem,” she said.But Baier pressed Harris on the number of undocumented migrants who had entered the country in recent years, and confronted Harris with a video clip of a family member blaming the Biden-Harris administration for the death of a woman murdered by someone in the country illegally.Asked if she would apologize to that family, Harris responded that they were “tragic cases.”“I am so sorry for her loss. I am so sorry for her loss, sincerely,” Harris added. “I feel awful for what she and her family have experienced.”But she also insisted that Trump had stymied efforts to find a bipartisan solution to the problem, saying: “Let’s talk about what is happening right now with an individual who does not want to participate in solutions.”During the interview, Baier also played an advertisement from the Trump campaign attacking Harris for statements during the 2020 presidential campaign in which she said she would use taxpayer dollars to pay for gender transition surgeries for prisoners.Harris responded by noting a recent New York Times report that federal prisoners had received gender affirming care during Trump’s administration.“I think frankly that ad from the Trump campaign is a little bit of like throwing you know stones when you’re living in a glass house,” Harris said. “I will follow the law, and it’s a law that Donald Trump actually followed.”While Harris earned plaudits from supporters who applauded her vigorous exchange with Baier, one moment during the exchanged seemed destined to become fodder in future campaign ads.When the Fox News host defended Trump by saying the Republican didn’t actively advocate the treatment for transgender inmates, Harris said candidates had to take responsibility “for what happened in your administration.”The line could provide a convenient soundbite for Trump at a moment Harris’ campaign is seeking distance from Biden. Harris devoted significant time during the Fox interview to arguing she represented “a new generation of leadership,” after earning criticism for saying during an interview with The View last week that she could not think of a decision she would have approached differently than the current president.Still, asked what voters should turn the page from - particularly with polls showing many unhappy with the direction of the country — Harris focused her response toward her opponent: “The last decade in which we have been burdened with the kind of rhetoric coming from Donald Trump.”","The Democratic presidential nominee’s first formal interview with the outlet ran for nearly half an hour.

Vice President Kamala Harris in her first exclusive interview with Fox News since becoming the Democratic presidential nominee, outlined her economic strategy, and claiming that that it is superior to that of former President Donald Trump . Despite some polls indicating that the public trusts Trump more on economic issues, Harris presented her case for a forward-looking plan.When asked why people express greater trust in Trump regarding the economy, Harris responded, “When you look at an analysis of our plans, it’s clear that moving forward requires a shift from the divisiveness and rhetoric associated with Trump.” She said that her economic policy aims to strengthen the nation, contrasting it with Trump's approach, which she characterised as benefiting billionaires and large corporations at the expense of the national deficit.""My plan for the economy does exactly that. His plan would be, again, to give tax cuts to billionaires and the biggest corporations in our country and blow up our deficit,"" she said.Despite the combative tone of the interview, in which Harris often had to contend with interruptions, she conveyed her commitment to new ideas and bipartisan cooperation to address critical issues like housing shortages and support for small businesses.Critics from Trump’s camp labelled the interview a “train wreck,” arguing that Harris failed to take responsibility for her party's shortcomings. However, Democratic supporters pointed out that Harris successfully communicated her policies to a typically unfriendly audience without making significant errors.Harris’s efforts to engage with Republican voters included an event in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, where she talked about Trump’s attempts to undermine the 2020 election results. “He refused to accept the will of the people,” she stated, underscoring her belief that unity across party lines is essential for the upcoming election.Recent polling by Reuters/Ipsos revealed a tight race, with Harris leading Trump 45% to 42% nationally, although Trump's support on economic issues stands at 45%, compared to Harris’s 40%.","Kamala Harris gave her first interview since becoming the Democratic presidential nominee.

The conversation, which unfolded with host Bret Baier, was marked by pointed exchanges as Harris defended her administration's policies while being pressed on immigration statistics and controversial decisions.""The point is that we have a broken immigration system that needs to be repaired,"" Harris stated firmly, countering Baier’s interruptions regarding the release of illegal immigrants into the country.Baier referenced estimates from the Department of Homeland Security, suggesting that up to six million individuals had been released, to which Harris insisted, ""I’m not finished. We have a broken immigration system.""Baier's inquiries intensified, particularly surrounding the Biden administration 's reversal of several Trump-era policies, notably the termination of the ""Remain in Mexico"" policy. ""Do you regret the decision to terminate Remain in Mexico at the beginning of your administration?"" he asked. Harris responded by repeating that immigration reform was one of the first legislative priorities of her administration, claiming, ""We recognised from day one that it is a priority for us as a nation.""Throughout the interview, Harris maintained that her administration had made strides to address immigration issues, such as enhancing the asylum system and increasing penalties for illegal crossings. She also pointed to bipartisan efforts to strengthen border security, claiming that a proposed border bill would have allocated additional resources and personnel to combat issues such as the influx of fentanyl. ""Donald Trump learned about that bill and told them to kill it because he preferred to avoid fixing the problem,"" she asserted.As the discussion turned to specific violent crimes committed by illegal immigrants, Baier pressed Harris on whether she owed apologies to the families of victims. Referencing cases such as those of Jocelyn Nungaray and Rachel Morin, he asked, ""Do you owe those families an apology?"" Harris acknowledged the tragic nature of these incidents saying, ""I feel awful for what she and her family have experienced.""When questioned about the Biden administration's assertions regarding border security, Harris maintained that the issues transcended her tenure and were part of a long-standing problem, stating, ""We've had a broken immigration system... even before [Trump's administration]."" She called for more judges and resources to expedite case processing and reiterated that comprehensive reform was essential.In response to inquiries regarding taxpayer-funded surgeries for transgender individuals in custody, Harris diverted the conversation back to the Trump administration , arguing that such provisions were already in place under his leadership.

Pakistan's Punjab CM blames PTI party

Senior directors of a Pakistan college stated on Wednesday that there was no evidence to support claims of a student being raped on campus, despite reports circulating online that led to several days of protests. The allegations, which spread through social media posts, claimed that a woman was raped in the basement of a Punjab College for Women campus in Lahore .In response to the posts, hundreds of students, mostly male, engaged in protests that involved smashing windows and burning school buses. These demonstrations reflect a growing concern in Pakistan regarding safety, harassment, and sexual violence.Arif Chaudry, the Lahore director of the private Punjab Group of Colleges , which operates the women's college, was quoted by AFP during a press conference saying, ""The incident does not exist. I will resign and I will leave this profession and stand with the students if the incident took place.""Another director of the group, Agha Tahir Ijaz, urged students not to believe misinformation during the same news conference.As the anger grew over the alleged incident, police arrested a security guard who was identified in the online posts. However, they reported that no victim had come forward and that they were unable to verify the incident.The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) cybercrime wing has initiated an investigation targeting individuals responsible for disseminating the information via social media channels which is now claimed to be false.The protests, which began at two of the college's campuses on Monday afternoon, quickly spread to several other colleges throughout the city and continued for three days and resulted in injuries to at least 28 people.As the college denied the claims, Maryam Nawaz , the chief minister of Pakistan's Punjab also addressed the alleged rape incident, asserting that the accusations were 'fabricated'.Nawaz further claimed that the political party led by Imran Khan , Pakistan's former prime minister who is currently imprisoned, exploited the false allegation to provoke extensive student demonstrations and cause instability throughout the province.The Punjab government has closed the college campus where the alleged rape was said to have occurred until further notice. ""On social media, a factory of lies is running. PTI's politics have sunk so low that it is exploiting tragedies for political gain,"" Maryam said while warning that those responsible for spreading the false posts would face punishment. Addressing PTI founder Imran Khan, the CM added, ""If politics stoops to such levels of inhumanity, then you deserve to be where you are."" She then claimed that the girl in question had suffered a back injury and had been receiving treatment in the hospital's intensive care unit since October 2 and was not raped.","Pakistan's Punjab CM blames PTI party for 'fabricated' rape claims.

Islamabad 'lockdown' greets Chinese PM amid aftershocks of Karachi suicide attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/islamabad-lockdown-greets-chinese-pm-amid-aftershocks-of-karachi-suicide-attack/articleshow/114231377.cms,"ISLAMABAD: PM Li Qiang of China arrived in Islamabad Monday to a 21-gun salute and a security overdrive that included shutting schools and businesses in the capital city for three days as Pakistan pulled out all stops to avoid any safety slip-up during the first visit by a Chinese premier to the country in 11 years.Li's four-day trip to oversee the signing of bilateral trade and economic agreements, inaugurate an international airport in the southwestern port city of Gwadar, and attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit comes just over a week after a suicide attack near Karachi airport in which two Chinese engineers died and 11 others were wounded.As PM Shehbaz Sharif and members of his cabinet received Li at the Chaklala airbase in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, adjacent to Islamabad, news arrived of at least three cops and as many militants being killed during an attack on the district police headquarters in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.A wave of violence has swept Pakistan lately, including 21 miners being shot and killed in Balochistan, where the new Gwadar airport is located. Li is likely to virtually inaugurate the CPEC-funded airport in the southwestern province, bordering Afghanistan and Iran.Neither side commented on the reason for a virtual inauguration, but sources cited heightened security concerns following the recent Karachi attack for Li being advised against travelling to a restive region.Islamabad, too, has sought to temporarily curb the movements of Chinese nationals in the country, citing fears of violence from armed groups. Officials said the Karachi blast is likely to figure in talks between Li and his Pakistani counterpart.“We will review progress on existing initiatives, especially the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ), and also explore new avenues of mutually beneficial cooperation. The Pakistan-China all-weather strategic cooperative partnership is the cornerstone of regional stability and prosperity,” Shehbaz wrote on X.According to the foreign office, Li will also call on President Asif Ali Zardari and hold meetings with parliamentary members and the senior military leadership.The two-day SCO meeting starts Tuesday in Islamabad. The administration announced a three-day public holiday in the capital city, beginning Monday, with contingents of police, army and paramilitary forces out on the streets in what appeared to be a veritable lockdown.The SCO participants include the PMs of Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. India's foreign minister, S Jaishankar, and Iran's vice-president, Mohammad Reza Aref, are also expected at the summit.Jaishankar has already stated that he wouldn't discuss bilateral ties with Pakistan during his visit, the first in nearly a decade.The opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) of jailed ex-PM Imran Khan announced a protest Tuesday in Islamabad if the govt did not allow his family members, lawyers and doctors to meet him in prison.","PM Li Qiang of China arrived in Islamabad Monday to a 21-gun salute and a security overdrive that included shutting schools and businesses in the capital city for three days.
