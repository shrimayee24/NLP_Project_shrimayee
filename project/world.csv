CHENNAI: A packed express train travelling at 75kmph rear-ended a stationary freight rake on the outskirts of Chennai at 8.30pm Friday, causing at least 12 passenger coaches to derail and sparking a fire in the parcel van. At least 20 passengers on Mysuru–Darbhanga Bagmati Express were injured but there was no casualty reported.Bagmati Express entered the loop line — a track that branches out from the main route and merges with it again after a short distance — and rammed into the back of the freight train stationed on that stretch of Kavaraipettai station , about 46km from Chennai, Southern Railway said.The passenger train had passed Ponneri station at 8.27pm and received the green signal to proceed to Kavaraipettai. “While entering KVP station, the train crew experienced a heavy jerk and, instead of going into the main line per the signal that was given, the train entered the loop line and hit the goods train standing there,” the railway statement said.“The crew are safe. The next coach, i.e. a parcel van caught fire, which was doused by the fire brigade. So far, no casualties are reported.”Officials said most of the passengers had been rescued and either released or moved to hospitals, as required. Arrangements are also being made to feed and transport the stranded passengers. Southern Railway Chennai Division said anyone requiring information about the passengers could call the helpline number at 04425354151 and 0442435499.Train traffic on the route was suspended after the collision as rescue and medical teams got to work at the site.

: Former UK prime minister Boris Johnson says in his memoir that when he first met PM Narendra Modi in London he felt “his curious astral energy”.Johnson says that in 2012, on his first trade trip to India as London mayor, the FCDO had told him not to meet Modi “because he was a Hindu nationalist”.Yet when he first met him outside City Hall a few years later, “he raised my arm and chanted something in Hindi, and I felt his curious astral energy”, Johnson writes in his book “Unleashed”.After Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, he travelled to India in April 2022 to wean India off Russia . He said the welcome he received was “like an orchestrated orgy of state-sponsored Beatlemania”. He said he understood “the reasons for India’s post-war non-alignment with the West” and “India’s dependence on Russian hydrocarbons”.“But I wondered if it was not time fora modulation, a rethink. Did India really want to be aligned with this pair of autocracies,” he writes, referring to Russia and China. He pointed out to the Indians that “Russian missiles were turning out to be less accurate statistically” than his first serve at tennis. “Did they really want to keep Russia as their main supplier of military hardware?” The trip was a success.“Overcoming the qualms of the MoD, who are always worried about India’s closeness to Russia, we agreed to work together on all kinds of military technology, from submarines to helicopters to marine propulsion units,” he writes.Johnson discloses a private conversation he had with Queen Elizabeth in Sept 2022 at Balmoral two days before she died. He told her about the “well-known” difficulties the UK govt was having in persuading India to “take a tougher line with the Russians” on the Ukraine war and she told him something Jawaharlal Nehru had told her in the 1950s. “‘He told me that India will always side with Russia, and that some things will never change. They just are,’” he quotes the Queen as saying.","Former UK prime minister Boris Johnson says in his memoir that when he first met PM Narendra Modi in London he felt “his curious astral energy” Johnson says that in 2012, on his first trade trip to India as London mayor, the FCDO had told him not to meet Modi “because he was a Hindu nationalist”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114157568,imgsize-802102,width-400,resizemode-4/114157568.jpg"

He turned out to be the girl's lover. The matter came to light after the older woman's body was found in a field under Jasrathpur police station of Etah district on Oct 6.After an initial probe by police established that the body was that of a woman called Alka (who goes by her first name), a resident of Allahpur under Nayagaon police station in Etah.Exasperated by her daughter's wayward behavior, Alka had hired Subhash Singh , 38, to kill her child without knowing that he was the teenager's lover, said police on Friday. Subhash and the woman's daughter were arrested on Wednesday night.Police said that Alka's daughter had eloped with a youth from their area a few months ago. Alka then sent her daughter to her maternal home in Farrukhabad. It was there that she started talking to Subhash for long hours over the phone and they soon developed a relationship. When her uncle noticed the calls, he asked Alka to take the girl home. Furious at the embarassment, Alka then decided to eliminate her daughter.On Sept 27, Alka contacted Subhash and offered him Rs 50,000 to kill her daughter, said police, adding Subhash shared the information with the girl, who promised to marry him if he killed her mother instead.

All about Nobel Peace Prize



The Nobel Peace Prize 2023 was awarded to Narges Mohammadi ""for her fight against the oppression of women in Iran and her fight to promote human rights and freedom for all.” At 17 years old, Malala Yousafzai became the youngest-ever Nobel Peace Prize laureate. At 86 years old, Joseph Rotblat became the oldest Nobel Peace Prize laureate in 1995. The Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded 104 times to 141 laureates between 1901 and 2023, comprising 111 individuals and 30 organizations. The International Committee of the Red Cross has received the Nobel Peace Prize three times (in 1917, 1944, and 1963), while the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has been honored twice (in 1954 and 1981). This brings the total number of unique organisations awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to 30.

The Nobel Peace Prize in 2024 has been awarded to the Japanese organisation Nihon Hidankyo to honour all atomic bomb survivors from Hiroshima and Nagasaki , ""for its efforts to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons and for demonstrating through witness testimony that nuclear weapons must never be used again.""This grassroots movement, composed of atomic bomb survivors from Hiroshima and Nagasaki, known as Hibakusha, is being honored for its dedication to establishing a world free of nuclear weapons.The Nobel committee at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences made this announcement on Friday. A total of 286 candidates were nominated for the Nobel peace prize.In 1956, local Hibakusha associations, along with victims of nuclear weapons tests in the Pacific, established the Japan Confederation of A- and H-Bomb Sufferers Organisations. This name was later abbreviated in Japanese to Nihon Hidankyo, which grew to become the largest and most influential Hibakusha organisation in Japan.They have been instrumental in fostering and strengthening global opposition to nuclear weapons by sharing their personal stories, developing educational campaigns based on their experiences, and issuing urgent warnings about the proliferation and use of nuclear arms.The Norwegian Nobel Committee said for nearly 80 years, no nuclear weapon has been used in warfare. The decision to award the 2024 Nobel Peace Prize to Nihon Hidankyo was firmly rooted in Alfred Nobel’s will. The 2024 Nobel Peace Prize embodies Alfred Nobel’s intent to recognize efforts that provide the greatest benefit to humanity, they added.On this day, during the final stages of World War II, the United States dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima known as ""Little Boy."" The bomb detonated at 8.15 am, releasing a force equivalent to 15,000 tons of TNT. This caused catastrophic destruction, leveling buildings and igniting widespread fires across the city.Just three days after Hiroshima the US dropped the second atomic bomb, ""Fat Man,"" on Nagasaki at approximately 11.02 am. This attack caused significant destruction and resulted in a tragic loss of life, further compounded by the long-term effects of radiation exposure.The Nobel announcements, spanning six days, kicked off on Monday.","Nobel Peace Prize 2023 was awarded to Narges Mohammadi for her fight against the oppression of women in Iran.

In Kitsap County , Washington , 911 calls about loose livestock and troublesome pets are not unusual. However, a recent call from a woman near Poulsbo about being surrounded by 50 to 100 raccoons drew significant attention. The situation became so overwhelming that the woman ultimately fled her property.The story began a decade ago when she started feeding a family of raccoons and it was fine until about six weeks earlier, but when the number showing up went from a handful to around 100 it became a problem.The woman said, “Over time those raccoons became more aggressive, demanding food, they would hound her day and night — scratching at the outside of her home, at the door. If she pulled up her car, they would surround the car, scratch at the car, and surround her if she went from her front door to her car or went outside at all.”“They saw this as a food source now, so they kept coming back to it and they kept expecting food,” she added.The sudden increase in the raccoon population remains unclear, but both the sheriff's office and the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife confirmed that the woman did not break any law while feeding those raccoons, as it is illegal in the state to feed large carnivores such as coyotes and bears.“This is a nuisance problem of her own making that she must address,” said Kevin McCarty, a spokesperson for the sheriff’s office.Deputies who responded said that there were at least 50 to 100 raccoons present on her property.After consulting with a wildlife conflict specialist , the woman has stopped feeding the raccoons, and they have started to disperse.","A woman in Kitsap County, Washington, received a call about a large group of raccoons on her property.

Want to bet on US elections? This last-minute ruling has changed gambling rules,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/want-to-bet-on-us-elections-this-last-minute-ruling-has-changed-gambling-rules/articleshow/114162153.cms,"Donald Trump and Kamala Harris (R)

Millions of dollars are being bet on the outcome of the US presidential election after a court ruling opened the door for legal political gambling , raising the stakes in an already tense and closely contested race.With just weeks to the D-Day, November 5 vote, election contracts on platforms like Interactive Brokers are heating up, following a Washington court decision that allowed a startup, Kalshi , to offer election betting despite ongoing legal appeals.By Friday, contracts for a Harris victory were trading between 48 and 50 percent, making it a near 50-50 split between Harris and Trump . More than $6.3 million has already been gambled on this matchup alone.This comes on the heels of the October 2 ruling, which marks a pivotal moment in a long-standing regulatory battle over the legality of political betting in the United States.Offshore markets, which have operated outside US regulators' purview, have seen even larger sums, with more than $1.7 billion already placed on the Harris-Trump race through platforms like Polymarket. There, Trump holds a slight edge with 54 percent support versus 45 percent for Harris.Supporters of election betting, or ""event contracts,"" argue that these markets offer a financial hedge against potential outcomes, akin to futures trading. ""These contracts allow people to take a position on what they think is going to happen and manage their risk accordingly,"" saidSteve Sanders , executive vice president at Interactive Brokers, which has already seen more than a million contracts traded in a matter of days.However, critics warn against widespread election gambling, especially in a politically polarised climate rife with disinformation. During recent court proceedings, Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) General Counsel Rob Schwartz raised concerns about the potential for misinformation to fuel bets.""We live in a country where tens of millions believe the last election was stolen,"" Schwartz said, highlighting the risks of undermining public trust in election integrity .Despite these concerns, the court allowed betting to continue while the legal case against Kalshi moves forward. Judge Patricia Millett acknowledged the need for election integrity but said the CFTC hadn’t shown enough evidence that election contracts would cause harm.While the legal fight goes on, political betting markets will likely stay open through Election Day, which could influence the future of legal gambling in the US. For advocates like Pratik Chougule, co-founder of the Coalition for Political Forecasting, the court's decision is a big win. ""It's been a good year for political betting,"" he said, hopeful that legal election markets will continue to grow.Further court rulings may close political betting again, but this is unlikely to happen before the November 5 election, keeping the markets active for now.","More than $6.3 million has already been gambled on the Harris-Trump race alone.

As Hurricane Milton struck Florida, a fishing boat captain was stranded for 8 hours in the Gulf of Mexico . The captain faced extreme conditions in the sea before finally being rescued by the US Coast Guard .The captain, whose name was not released, went out early at around 3 am on Wednesday to repair his broken boat ‘Captain Dave,’ as reported by the Washington Post.Around noon, the boat’s owner reported to the Coast Guard that the captain hadn’t checked in. “Watchstanders were able to make radio contact with the captain who reported the rudder was fouled with a line and became disabled during his transit back to port,” the US Coast Guard agency said in the release.The fishing vessel earlier in the week had broken down some 20 miles off John’s Pass in Pinellas County, and the captain and another crew member were rescued from it on Monday, but the vessel was left with salvage arrangements to be made.At that time, the Coast Guard reported winds of around 30 mph and waves reaching 6-8 feet. As conditions worsened with Hurricane Milton approaching, Coast Guard officials instructed the captain to wear alife jacket and keep the boat's emergency beacon close to ensure he could be located.However, by 6:45 pm, roughly two hours before Milton made landfall 20 miles south of John’s Pass, the Coast Guard lost contact with him. The Coast Guard launched a tedious search and rescue operation at around 5:30 am on Thursday, deploying airplane and helicopter crews.After a harrowing night of survival, the captain was found clinging to a cooler 30 miles off Longboat Key, around 1:30 pm on Thursday, more than 8 hours later after contact was lost.“This man survived in a nightmare scenario for even the most experienced mariner,” Lt. Cmdr. Dana Grady, the Coast Guard’s command center chief in St. Petersburg, Fla., said in a news release.The unnamed captain survived the extreme conditions in an incredibly dangerous situation. “He experienced the severity of the hurricane conditions, we estimate he experienced approximately 75-90 mph winds, 20-25 foot waves, for an extended period of time to include overnight,” Grady said in the release.“He survived because of a life jacket, his emergency position indicating locator beacon, and a cooler,” Grady said.","A fishing boat captain was stranded for 8 hours in the Gulf of Mexico as Hurricane Milton struck Florida.

Like Epstein list, a list of names, all celebrities, with links to P Diddy and his Freak off sessions, are doing the rounds on social media. The alleged list contains names of Leonardo Dicaprio , Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Ashton Kutcher, Paris Hilton, Howard Stern, Russell Brand, Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez, Russell Simmons, Usher, Meghan Fox. The list goes viral as Usher, Pink deleted their X posts and theories that Justin Bieber might have been a victim of Diddy float around.Nobody has been implicated in the Sean Combs case so far.P Diddy is facing serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering where he forced women to have sex with male prostitutes that continued for days as the entire action was caught on camera. Huge stocks of baby oil, drugs were found at Diddy's sex den while Diddy did not plead guilty to the charges.Usher who once stayed with Diddy said his X account got hacked and that's why all his past posts disappeared. This happened as his old statement in which said he witnessed wild things when he stayed with Diddy resurfaced.Apart from Usher and Pink, Megan Fox deleted all her posts on Instagram and X triggering speculations over how she was linked to Diddy.An old snipped of Khloe Kardashian claiming that she attended one of Diddy's naked parties emerged. ""I got on a plane at 5:30 am. Well this party...I think half the people there were butt naked,"" this is exactly what Khloe said about Diddy's party.Diddy was Justin Bieber's mentor but Bieber's spokesperson said he is trying not to focus on the charges and accusation of Diddy. Justin is in a happy bubble since he became a father.As the list of the Hollywood A-listers becomes long, they are maintaining absolute silence over Diddy's arrest.An officer involved in the raid on Diddy's home compared him to Jeffrey Epstein, stating that Diddy was part of the same social circle as Epstein and Harvey Weinstein. The officer claimed there were 15 years of wild parties, suggesting that while not everyone who attended was complicit in trafficking, they witnessed inappropriate behavior. He emphasized that many people knew what went on, especially as things became more explicit late at night.Also read on the Diddy case:","No Hollywood A-lister has been implicated in the Sean Diddy trafficking case but several 'Diddy lists' are viral.

US President Joe Biden , on Friday, updated the press on the federal response to recent hurricanes while making some light-hearted jokes about his Cabinet members. He stressed the administration's focus on restoring power and clearing debris in affected states, jokingly calling Energy secretary Jennifer Granholm his ""boss"" and referring to vice president Kamala Harris as ""the president.""During the briefing, Biden acknowledged the severe toll the hurricanes have taken on states such as North Carolina and Florida .""Our hearts go out to all those folks who've lost not only personal property, but their homes and some lost lives and are grieving after the aftermath of the tornadoes, brutal wind, record downpours and historic flooding,"" he said, as quoted by Fox News. Hurricane Milton has caused an estimated $50 billion in damages, while North Carolina officials confirmed at least 92 fatalities from Hurricane Helene . In Florida, eight people were reported dead after Milton spawned four tornadoes in St Lucie County, with millions of residents still without power.Biden praised the efforts by Florida governor Ron DeSantis , which enabled 50,000 power line workers to restore electricity to 1 million customers. The president assured that the federal government, through FEMA , the Coast Guard, the Army Corps of Engineers, and the National Guard, is fully engaged in rescue and recovery efforts.During his speech, Biden paused briefly before Granholm reminded him to pass the microphone to the vice president. He grabbed Granholm's hand and said, ""She's my boss here,"" before jokingly correcting himself when he referred to Harris as ""the president.""Before giving the floor to Harris, Biden confirmed his administration would seek additional funding from Congress for hurricane recovery . ""We're going to need a lot of help.

A dog found tied to a fence on a Florida highway during evacuations ahead of Hurricane Milton is now recovering at a rescue facility in Tallahassee, the Leon County Humane Society has confirmed.The dog was spotted by a Florida Highway Patrol trooper on Wednesday along Interstate 75 near Tampa, standing in rising floodwater that had already reached its belly. Video footage showed the distressed dog barking as the trooper approached.""I don’t blame you,” the trooper said. “It’s OK, buddy, it’s OK"", as quoted by Fox59 News.After rescuing the animal, the Florida Highway Patrol issued a plea to residents, urging them not to abandon pets during evacuations. “Do NOT do this to your pets, please,” the agency wrote in a post.The incident gained national attention. A representative from the Leon County Humane Society later confirmed the dog was safely under their care. “We know that without the help of Florida Highway Patrol Troopers, this dog would not have made it through,” the Humane Society said in a message posted on its Facebook page. “We’re grateful the Troopers understood he was a scared and abandoned dog and treated him so patiently and kind during the rescue.”The dog has since been named “Trooper” to honour those who saved him. Although Trooper is safe, the Humane Society said he remains stressed and is “still decompressing.” Full recovery could take months.The organisation strongly condemned the act of abandoning animals during emergencies. “It was cruel and thoughtless, not only toward him, but toward the people trying their best to handle the incoming storm,” read the Facebook post.The Humane Society has received numerous adoption inquiries but will not be accepting applications until Trooper is fully rehabilitated. “We want to be sure we know exactly what he needs before even considering adoption,” they wrote, confirming the dog will remain in foster care until fully ready for a new home.","Dog was found tied to a fence on a Florida highway during evacuations ahead of Hurricane Milton.

Former US President Trump is set to participate in a Fox News town hall next week, aimed exclusively at female voters , as he attempts to expand his appeal among a demographic he has traditionally struggled to win over.The event will be recorded on Tuesday in Cumming, Georgia, and will air on Wednesday morning. It will be moderated by Harris Faulkner, a seasoned interviewer who has spoken with Trump multiple times.“Women constitute the largest group of registered and active voters in the United States, so it is paramount that female voters understand where the presidential candidates stand on the issues that matter to them most,” Faulkner said.Fox News has also invited vice president Kamala Harris to participate in a similar forum. Harris has confirmed her attendance at a live town hall hosted by CNN on October 23, following Trump’s refusal to debate her on that date.Despite his popularity among male voters, Trump lags behind Harris among women, according to recent polling . An ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted after the September 10 debate showed Harris leading Trump by 9 percentage points among female voters, 53% to 44%. A New York Times/Siena College poll revealed an even wider gap, with Harris at 53% and Trump at 42% among women. On the other hand, Trump holds a big advantage among men, garnering 56% support to Harris's 39%.","The event will be recorded on Tuesday in Cumming, Georgia, and will air on Wednesday morning.

Lewellen and her boyfriend, Dewey Bennett , faced the difficult task of getting to a hospital while bracing for the approaching storm, as reported by NBC News .The storm hadn’t yet made landfall, but water was already seeping into their home when Lewellen’s contractions began.At 39 weeks pregnant, they knew they needed to act quickly, fearing that flooded roads would prevent them from reaching the hospital in time. “I just didn’t want to go through what I had to go through with the last hurricane back in 2017,” said Bennett, whose father had died after emergency services couldn’t reach him during the storm.While contemplating evacuation to West Palm Beach , which was hit by nine tornadoes , they decided to stay put. When Lewellen’s contractions intensified after 4.5 hours of labour at home, they went to Sarasota Memorial Hospital in Venice. “My mum was driving us, and it was extremely windy,” Lewellen said, adding that few cars were on the road due to the dangerous conditions.Once at the hospital, Lewellen's mother wasn’t allowed to stay with her due to hospital restrictions. “I was very upset that my mum couldn’t stay because she’s my best friend,” she said. They managed to stay connected via FaceTime throughout much of the labour.As the hurricane intensified, Lewellen watched from her hospital window as strong winds battered Sarasota. “I was telling him, ‘Oh, that tree looks like it’s going to fly out of the ground!’” she said. The tree eventually uprooted, heightening the tension of the night.Problems arose when doctors informed Lewellen that her baby was in the wrong position, requiring an emergency C-section . A failed epidural left her in severe pain until she was given anaesthesia. “I was very scared. If I didn’t have the doctors and nurses I had, it would’ve been a lot worse,” she said.At 11.45 pm, Dewey Lester Bennett IV was born, an 8-pound baby boy. Bennett said, “My cheeks hurt because I haven’t stopped smiling.”Despite the storm, Lewellen and Bennett were elated by their newborn’s safe arrival. Holding their son for the first time, Lewellen described it as “the most indescribable feeling.” Reflecting on the birth, she added with a smile, “He is a miracle baby .”","22-year-old Kenzie Lewellen went into labour at 4 am on Wednesday in Port Charlotte, Florida.

Maladroit in Detroit: Trump trashes MoTown in weird Michigan gambit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/maladroit-in-detroit-trump-trashes-motown-in-weird-michigan-gambit/articleshow/114156707.cms,"WASHINGTON: MAGA megaphone Donald Trump 's maverick campaign style came to the fore again on Thursday when he dumped on Detroit while speaking to the Detroit Economic Club , warning that the famed motor city will be doomed if Kamala Harris becomes president.In fact, he went further. “Our whole country will end up being like Detroit if she’s your president. You’re going to have a mess on your hands,"" Trump said in the largest city in Michigan, a battleground state that is crucial to his White House prospect.Polls show him tied within the margin of error in Michigan, and disquiet over Democrats' stand on the middle-east among the state's 300,000 Arab-American community centering around nearby Dearborn was thought to give Trump a chance to win. Some analysts think he may have blown it, with one political operative saying it is like someone ""calling us ugly and then asking us out on a date.""Detroiters did not take kindly to the slight. ""I represent Detroit in Congress. Detroit is a city with a booming economy, diverse culture, and some of the best people in America,"" snapped back Shri Thanedar, the Indian-American Congressman from the 13th Congressional district that includes Detroit, asking Trump to ""keep Detroit and our people out of your mouth.""“This is the greatest city in the country & we’ve bounced back after Trump killed our jobs, closed our businesses, & tried to throw out our votes. #Detroit threw Trump out of the White House last time and we’ll do it again,"" the state's House Speaker Joe Tate said. Kamala Harris too pitched in, saying Trump's trashing of another great American city a ""further evidence on a very long list of why he is unfit to be president.""But such bluntspeak is part of Trump's campaign shtick, one that includes painting much of urban America as a dystopian hellscape that only he can rescue. He has said this about San Francisco, New York, Milwaukee, and Philadelphia, among other cities, and even further, called the US ""a stupid country run by stupid people.” All the cities have large black and minority populations.Trump put-down of Detroit came when he was pledging to restore its once famed reputation as the center of automobile world. While the so-called Motown has lost much of its mojo with automobile production moving across the border to Canada and Mexico, and further afield to China and India, the city has been bouncing back in recent years, reporting the first increase in population in decades this year as manufacturing trickles back.In another rambling speech that lasted almost two hours, Trump also griped about Barack Obama getting a Nobel Peace Prize and he not getting one, and boasted about getting Michigan's Man of the Year award some 20 years ago, berating the media for questioning his claim by pulling out a paper clipping from a local newspaper that showed an even more minor award given by the local unit of the Republican Party.Trump though threw out more financial largesse aimed at winning votes, pledging to make interest on car loans fully tax deductible.","'Our whole country will end up being like Detroit if she’s your president.

Harris is dressed in a Gabriela Hearst suit and wears her now-famous Tiffany earrings , which previously sparked conspiracy theories during her debate with former President Donald Trump, with some claiming they were disguised audio devices.In the article, Vogue highlights Harris' rise in politics, calling her someone “summoned for acts of national rescue” after President Joe Biden decided to end his reelection campaign. “With President Joe Biden’s decision to end his reelection campaign, the world looked to Harris with hopes and doubts,” the profile says.Recalling the moment Biden informed her of his decision, Harris said she had been making pancakes with her nieces when the president’s call came through. “It’s Joe Biden,” she remembered telling her family, adding that it was “a dramatic turn to the day"", as quoted by the New York Post .Harris shared that she couldn’t immediately reach her husband, Doug Emhoff , who was in Los Angeles when flights were grounded due to a computer glitch. “I’m like, ‘Where is he?

The body of a Seattle woman was found inside a suitcase at a homeless encampment , which raised concerns about the dangers of these sites across the United States, as reported by Fox News.Shannon Reeder , a 37-year-old mother, had been missing since November 2023. Her remains were discovered by police on 27 September 2024, in a suitcase near a pile of rubbish at an encampment by Seattle’s Dr Jose Rizal Park, while authorities were clearing the area.Police are now investigating the circumstances surrounding her death.“Detectives are working with those who knew her to put together a timeline of her movements prior to her death,” the Washington State Patrol said. They have urged anyone with information to contact investigators, as they continue to explore whether Reeder died at the camp or elsewhere.According to the National Institutes of Health, violent crime rates are 40 times higher in homeless populations. Washington state has already closed 47 encampments in five counties since 2022, but the problem persists, with more than 31,000 homeless individuals across the state. King County , where Seattle is located, reported 14,149 homeless people during a 2023 count, making it the third-highest homeless population in the country after New York City and Los Angeles.Mark Powell , a former reserve police officer in San Diego, condemned the lack of control over these camps. “There are campsites all over the state of Washington, in California – every state has campsites and there are rules and regulations in the campsites… none of those rules apply [in homeless encampments],” he told Fox News Digital.He continued, “Somebody placed her in a suitcase and left her to die or left her to rot in the middle of an encampment. You would never see that happen anywhere else – you can’t just bury a person in your backyard.”Crisis counsellor Scott Silverman, who works with homeless veterans, described the camps as unsafe for vulnerable groups. ""Living in an encampment is not a safe thing for anybody… especially women, children and seniors because they’re easily targeted.""Homeless encampments have also been linked to public health crises , with diseases such as hepatitis A, typhus, and tuberculosis spreading due to unsanitary conditions. Silverman and other officials stress that without regular supervision, these camps will remain a serious threat to the homeless and nearby communities.","Shannon Reeder, a 37-year-old mother, had been missing since November 2023.

The major event is expected to see high-level Chinese representation and will also be attended by Indian external affairs minister S Jaishankar.Incessant violent incidents in Pakistan’s northwest and southwest have raised serious questions about the ability of its forces to protect high-profile events and foreigners in the country.The assailants, according to police, broke into the miners’ quarters in Balochistan’s Dukki district, gathered the workers together and opened indiscriminate fire. “A group of armed men attacked the Junaid coal company mines in Dukki area in the early hours using heavy weapons,” said Humayun Khan Nasir, in charge of Dukki police station. The victims belonged to various regions of Pakistan, as well as Afghanistan. “Most of the victims were from Pashtun-speaking regions within Balochistan. Three of the deceased and four of the injured are Afghan nationals,” Nasir added.Khairullah Nasir, the coal mine owner, said the attackers used hand grenades, rocket launchers, and other modern weapons in the attack. He added the attackers also set fire to “10 coal engines and machinery”.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack but suspicion is likely to fall on the outlawed Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), which often targets civilians and security forces, accusing them of robbing Balochistan of its resources, including minerals and gas.The BLA had carried out multiple attacks in Aug that resulted in more than 50 killings, including that of 23 passengers, mostly from Punjab province, who were shot dead after being taken out of their vehicles. On Monday the group had claimed responsibility for a suicide bomber attack on a convoy of Chinese engineers near Karachi airport. Two Chinese citizens were killed in that attack.There are hundreds of Chinese working in the country, most of them involved in projects linked to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), part of Beijing’s multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).

Amidst the deteriorating relationship, Pakistani border troops and Afghan Taliban fighters engaged in a clash while the former country's forces engaged in fence repair work.The incident occurred after the Afghan side launched an attack on a border post in the Naushki-Ghazni sector of the Pak-Afghan border , as reported by The Express Tribune. In response, the Pakistan Army launched a strong counterattack on the Afghan checkpoints, resulting in significant casualties for the Afghan Taliban.The Pakistani newspaper's sources suggested that Pakistan would continue to take robust measures to defend its borders, and its security forces reaffirmed their commitment to protecting the country's territorial integrity, delivering a decisive response to this aggression from Afghanistan.This incident was not an isolated case of unprovoked aggression from Afghan forces. In the previous month, the Afghan Taliban initiated unprovoked firing using heavy weapons, targeting Pakistani check posts from the Afghan region of Plosin. The fighting that took place during the night between September 8 and 9 resulted in the death of at least 16 Afghan Taliban fighters and the injury of 27 others.The Taliban came to power in Afghanistan in 2021, allegedly with the support of Pakistan, which had hoped that they would eliminate the threat of militancy emanating from their soil. However, for Pakistan, such hopes turned out to be an illusion as the Afghan Taliban failed to uproot the hideouts of Pakistan Taliban from their territory, leading to an increase in attacks against Pakistan and souring ties between Islamabad and Kabul.","Pakistani border troops and Afghan Taliban fighters engaged in a clash while the former country's forces engaged in fence repair work.

ISLAMABAD: The JUI-F has dismissed rumours that its president Maulana Fazlur Rehman has agreed to lend support to the PML-N-led ruling coalition on a proposed constitutional amendment , according to a media report on Wednesday. The Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI-F) has claimed that the decision to table the 'Constitutional Package' in Parliament had been postponed by the government at its request, The Dawn newspaper reported.The paper quoted sources in the party as saying that the stance regarding opposition to the amendment had not changed, calling the matter ""disputed"".According to a JUI-F source, the government agreed to postpone the amendment at the demand of Maulana Rehman. ""Now…this matter will be taken up after the SCO summit,"" said a party office-bearer.On Monday, the Maulana attended a multi-party moot on Palestine at the invitation of the president and the prime minister and also held a meeting with the bigwigs of the ruling coalition, giving rise to speculations that he had agreed to support the government.However, according to the party spokesperson, there was no truth to these reports while insiders termed the amendment disputed which the JUI-F chief would not agree to ""under the current circumstances"".Sources said the JUI-F endorsed a separate constitutional court but expressed reservations over the constitutional amendment.""Our concern was based on common sense - we demanded the document that we were supposed to vote for, but the government negotiating teams failed to do so,"" a senior party official remarked on the dialogue between the government and the JUI-F last month.The JUI-F still expects the government to share the draft with the party. The JUI-F leader said they would also share their draft on the constitutional court with the government and expected the government to do the same. In order to take everyone on board, the JUI-F leaders have suggested a separate constitutional bench instead of an independent court.On the other hand, the government is almost ready to table the constitutional amendment, and sources in the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz ( PML-N ) believe that this time, it would not be rushed through Parliament.""There will be separate sessions of the National Assembly and Senate and it is likely to be held on October 18,"" they added.It is likely that the National Assembly and Senate sessions will separately be convened on the same day and after getting it cleared from one house, the amendment would be introduced in the other the same day.In order to achieve a two-thirds majority, the ruling alliance has been trying to win over Maulana Rehman as well as some Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf-linked lawmakers whose votes against the party line would not be annulled following a review of Article 63A of the Constitution.The Pakistan Peoples Party and PML-N are in contact with Akhtar Mengal, the head of the Balochistan National Party (BNP-M) as well, hoping to secure the support of two BNP senators.Sardar Mengal, who recently resigned from the National Assembly, is still a member of the house as his resignation hasn't been accepted by the NA speaker, Dawn reported.",The Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI-F) has dismissed rumours that its president Maulana Fazlur Rehman has agreed to lend support to the PML-N-led ruling coalition.
