NEW DELHI: Businessman Robert Vadra was questioned by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with the Haryana land deal . After the session, he said on Wednesday that he believes in the truth and is prepared to face any kind of pressure.""I'm here for any kind of unjust pressure. I believe in the truth, and truth will prevail ,"" Vadra wrote on Facebook.He also claimed that his charitable work during his birthday week was being interrupted. Taking a subtle swipe at the government, Vadra said he would continue helping people until he was stopped from speaking out against what he called ""injustice"" towards minorities.""Nothing is going to deter me from fulfilling people's wishes and needs,"" he said.""My Birthday Week Seva has been paused for a few days. Plans I have made for feeding the elderly and gifts for all the children in different areas will be continued as soon as I get over the 'Government's ways of stopping Me', from doing good and speaking about their unjust behaviour towards minorities, or if there are wishes and talks of me being in politics,"" Vadra added.After several hours of questioning by the ED, Vadra told reporters that he had answered all the questions before and was doing so again.""All the questions which I have answered before are being answered again.

It's a political vendetta . They misuse the power of the probing agencies. I do not have any fear, as I have nothing to hide,"" he said.He pointed out that he had already submitted a large number of documents years ago and that the case was very old.""23,000 documents were submitted in 2019. The case that they are asking me about is a 20-year-old case. This is politically motivated. We abide by all the rules and regulations when we do any transaction. The ruling government always misuses the agency. They can ask me as many questions. I have nothing to hide. All is good,"" he said.Vadra expressed his frustration, saying there was no real case and that the questioning was just a distraction from other issues.""Case mein kuch nahin hai yaar... I hope there is a conclusion. They call me when they want to digress from the original issues,"" he said.Outside the ED office, Congress supporters shouted slogans like ""Jab jab Modi darta hai, ED ko aage karta hai,"" accusing the Modi government of using the agency to target opposition voices.","Businessman Robert Vadra was questioned by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with the Haryana land deal.

'TMC netas may've sparked violence with aid of Bangladeshis',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tmc-netas-mayve-sparked-violence-with-aid-of-bangladeshis/articleshow/120325976.cms,"New Delhi: Preliminary reports reaching the home ministry on the communal outbreak in Murshidabad, West Bengal, during protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act, suggest that the local Trinamool Congress leaders had allegedly prompted the Bangladeshi miscreants known to them and part of their ""larger network"", to trigger minor law and order disturbances so as to create an impression of public ""outrage"" against the Waqf law amendments. However, these minor clashes soon turned into full-blown communal violence as the Bangladeshi elements went out of control; instead of restricting themselves to engineering minor incidents as ""asked by TMC leaders', they decided to escalate things on their own and resorted to bloody clashes that claimed three lives, Central govt sources told TOI, citing inputs from intelligence agencies and other sources.The violence in Murshidabad specifically targeted Hindus, said sources. With TMC leaders no longer in control of the 'rogue' Bangladeshi elements, many Hindu families were forced to flee to Malda. This, according to media reports endorsed by BJP leader Amit Malviya in a post on 'X' on Tuesday, raised fears of renewed infiltration and communal unrest.With around 900 BSF troops deployed in Murshidabad since Friday to assist the state police and nearly 300 miscreants arrested, the situation there is now under control and no fresh violence reported. The Centre, in a fresh development, has sought a detailed clarification from the West Bengal govt, explaining its alleged failure to protect lives and property and attacks on railway assets and not taking adequate action in the initial stages of the violence, causing things to spin out of control. Asked if a timeline has been indicated for furnishing this clarification, a senior official said the Centre expects the state authorities to reply ""as soon as possible"".Concerned at the communal outbreak in Murshidabad, the home ministry had intervened on Saturday and placed additional Central paramilitary forces — essentially BSF — at disposal of the state govt to curb the violence, following the high court's directions.BSF additional director general (ADG) in charge of Eastern Command Ravi Gandhi, who was in Murshidabad over the last couple of days, told TOI that while the situation there is largely normal, there is still a sense of insecurity in Hindu localities. ""BSF has been receiving distress calls from locals, particularly Hindus, about the suspected presence of miscreants in the area and also minor stone-pelting incidents,"" he said.According to Gandhi, BSF has been engaging with the civilian population as part of confidence building measures. “We have set up pickets and are conducting intensive patrolling in Hindu-dominated localities. BSF is working in close collaboration with the state police. At the same time, Murshidabad being a border district, the force continues to be alert and is ensuring that the border remains fully secure, with no illegal cross-border activity,” he said.","The violence in Murshidabad specifically targeted Hindus, said sources.

'There is a group which is inciting youths here'

NEW DELHI: Survivors of the violent clashes in West Bengal’s Murshidabad district have recounted harrowing tales of destruction and fear following protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act that spiralled out of control on April 11-12.Displaced families now sheltering in relief camps in neighbouring Malda say they were forced to flee after mobs attacked homes and businesses, leaving at least three dead and hundreds homeless.“We came here on Saturday. Everything in our house was set on fire,” Lalchand Mandal told ANI, speaking from a camp in Par Lalpur. “We came here for shelter. If this violence happens again, how will we be able to go back to our homes? We want peace, we request the government to bring back peace there.”His sentiments were echoed by Rupa Mandal, who described the moment chaos erupted during a family meal. “Our entire house was set on fire. We were having lunch and suddenly, some people entered inside and started looting and attacking us. BSF personnel took us here to the relief camp. We want compensation for our house” she said.Shopkeepers have also suffered enormous losses. One trader revealed how his entire building was destroyed and his shop looted. “They broke through that and entered inside. They caused complete destruction and even looted some of our belongings. Opposite my building, I have a shop. They broke the shutter of that shop too. Monday was a bank holiday, so I received all the payments on Tuesday. I had around Rs13.5 lakh in cash with me. The cash was meant to be deposited at the bank, but it was all stolen. Apart from that, my shop had furniture and equipment worth Rs7-8 lakh, including chairs, tables, CPUs, computers, and laptops. Altogether, I had nearly Rs20-25 lakh in losses.”Adhir Ravi Das, another shopkeeper, said nothing remained of his business. “My shop has been completely damaged. Materials worth Rs 6-7 lakhs were in the shop; everything has been burnt. We want peace. Since BSF is here, the situation is normal. We want a BSF camp here.”Hyder Ali, whose nephew Izaz Ahmed was killed in the violence, had earlier told TOI that the threat of clashes still remain in the region : “There is a group which is inciting youths here. They will try to do it again. For them, it's political gains, but we will have to pay with the blood of our kin. Today it was Izaz; I do not know whom death will claim next.”The deployment of BSF and CRPF has brought some measure of calm to affected areas such as Samserganj, Dhulian, Suti and Jangipur. Shopkeeper Habib-ur-Rehman confirmed, “The situation in Samserganj is normal now. The administration is asking us to open our shops and stay disciplined. The situation has changed after BSF and CRPF have been deployed.”In response to the unrest, the Calcutta high court has ordered the deployment of central forces in Murshidabad. The BSF’s Additional Director General (East), Ravi Gandhi, toured the worst-hit areas, assuring residents that restoring peace was the top priority. “We spoke to people and assured them of their safety. The situation is slowly returning to normal,” he said.So far, around 210 people have been arrested. Meanwhile, two petitions have been filed in the Supreme Court seeking a judicial investigation into the violence and demanding better protection for affected citizens.",Displaced families now sheltering in relief camps in neighbouring Malda say they were forced to flee after mobs attacked homes and businesses.

NAGPUR: The Nagpur municipal commissioner offered Tuesday an unconditional apology to Bombay high court 's Nagpur bench for demolishing the home of riot accused Fahim Khan without adhering to Supreme Court-mandated procedures, reports Vaibhav Ganjapure.In an affidavit, municipal commissioner Abhijeet Chaudhari acknowledged that civic officials from the town planning and slum departments were unaware of SC's Nov 13, 2024 order that requires procedural safeguards before demolishing properties linked to suspects in communal violence.The court was hearing petitions from Fahim's mother, 69-year-old Mehrunissa, and 96-year-old Abdul Hafiz, whose relative was also named in the March 17 riots in the city's Mahal area. Fahim's house near Raza Masjid in Sanjay Bagh Colony had been razed by the time the high court took up the matter, while Hafiz's home was partially demolished.T he HC halted further demolition on March 25, ruling that the actions warranted judicial review. Petitioners argued that the demolitions were arbitrary and violated Supreme Court norms prohibiting punitive action without due process. Municipal commissioner Abhijeet Chaudhari said in court that neither competent authorities nor executive engineers were informed of SC’s ruling in writ petition no. 295/ 2022.“My inquiry revealed that no circular was issued under the Slum Act, 1971,” he said. Chaudhari said that Nagpur police had requested details of properties owned by riot accused and asked for verification of their building plans. The Mahal zone office inspected the properties and found them lacking sanctioned approvals. Show cause notices were issued under the Slum Act, and demolitions followed within 24 hours, without knowledge of SC’s requirements.“On March 21, the police commissioner reiterated his request to take action against the properties of rioters in accordance with law if these were illegal,” Chaudhari said. “Accordingly, the assistant commissioner of Mahal zone inspected properties and found that homes of both petitioners were prima facie built without sanctioned plans.” The division bench of judges Nitin Sambre and Vrushali Joshi granted Maharashtra govt a final opportunity to explain within two weeks why it failed to circulate SC’s order to municipal authorities","Nagpur municipal commissioner Abhijeet Chaudhari offered an unconditional apology to Bombay high court's Nagpur bench for demolishing the home of riot accused Fahim Khan.

Trump wants an apology from Harvard, the White House says | REUTERS

US President Donald Trump has stepped up pressure on Harvard University, demanding that the institution apologise for what he and his administration claim is the promotion of antisemitism.The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told journalists on Tuesday, “Trump wants to see Harvard apologise. And Harvard should apologise.”The statement follows Trump's post on Truth Social, where he warned that Harvard might lose its tax-exempt status. “Perhaps Harvard should lose its tax-exempt status and be taxed as a political entity if it keeps pushing political, ideological, and terrorist-inspired/supporting ‘sickness’? Remember, tax-exempt status is totally contingent on acting in the public interest!” he wrote.Last week, the Trump administration froze over $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts. The freeze came after Harvard refused to follow a new federal directive issued on April 3. The order demanded the dismantling of the university’s diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) offices, changes to its hiring and admissions policies, and cooperation with immigration checks for international students.In response, Harvard said the directive violates the first amendment and oversteps the federal government’s legal authority. “No government — regardless of which party is in power — should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue,” the university said in a public statement.The administration’s task force behind the funding freeze insists the measures are necessary to protect civil rights and ensure taxpayer accountability. Harvard, however, says it remains open to dialogue — but not to unlawful demands.","White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, “Trump wants to see Harvard apologise.

'Threat to American foreign policy'

After Mahmoud Khalil, Mohsen Mahdawi became the second Palestinian student at Columbia with a green card who was arrested by ICE for their deportation. Mahdawi and Khalil co-founded the Palestinian Student Union at Columbia in 2023 fall. Mahdawi's arrest is one of the most dramatic one so far pulled off by ICE as he was arrested from a Vermont immigration office where he came to give an interview for finalizing his US citizenship.Instead, he was arrested, making the citizenship interview look like a trap that Mahdawi walked into on his own. There were armed, plainclothes police with their faces covered who handcuffed Mahdawi.""This is immoral, inhumane, and illegal. Mr Mahdawi, a legal resident of the United States, must be afforded due process under the law and immediately released from detention,"" Vermont’s congressional delegation, Senators Bernie Sanders and Peter Welch and Rep. Becca Balint, said in their joint statement.Born in a refugee camp in the West Bank, Mahdawi has been living in the US for a decade legally. His family remains in the West Bank. He began his citizenship process in 2024 and the interview from where he was arrested was his last step to gain US citizenship. Mahdawi has plans to enroll in a master's program this fall.In defense for their action, the Trump administration cited the foreign policy rule of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 that grants the Secretary of State the authority to cancel someone's permanent residency if they are deemed to pose a threat to American foreign policy.Secretary of State Marco Rubio asserted that even permanent citizens can be removed. ""Visiting America is not an entitlement. It is a privilege extended to those who respect our laws and values. And, as Secretary of State, I will never forget that,"" Rubio wrote in an opion piece on Fox News.""US visa holders should know in no uncertain terms that the US government’s rigorous security vetting does not end once a visa is granted,"" he added.",Mohsen Mahdawi is the second Palestinian student at Columbia with a green card who was arrested by ICE for their deportation.

Melinda French Gates has opened up about her 2021 divorce from Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, calling the split “necessary” despite her ex-husband recently describing it as the biggest regret of his life. In a January interview, Bill Gates said ending their 27-year marriage was ""at the top of the list"" when it came to personal failures. The couple, who married in 1994, officially parted ways in August 2021.Recently, in a candid interview with The Times, French Gates addressed those comments, saying: “If you can’t live your values out inside your most intimate relationship, it was necessary.” While she chose not to directly respond to her ex-husband’s remarks, she noted: “I don’t even quite know what to make of that statement, so I’m not going to comment on what he says. He’s got his own life. I have my life now. I am very happy.”French Gates also spoke about the emotional toll of the divorce, revealing she suffered panic attacks during the separation. “When you’re leaving a marriage, it’s very, very hard. And the negotiations were tough,” she said.She shared that her first panic attack occurred in 2014 while having lunch with Gates, prompting her to begin therapy. “I’d heard of people having panic attacks and I didn’t know if it was a real thing,” she said.Initially skeptical of therapy, French Gates admitted she later came to understand its value. “It doesn’t mean I’m damaged,” she explained. “It means I’ve been through some difficult things that I need to figure out.”The former couple share three adult children—Jennifer, 28, Rory, 25, and Phoebe, 22—and are now grandparents to two. While Bill Gates has been dating Paula Hurd, widow of former Oracle CEO Mark Hurd, since 2022, French Gates confirmed she is currently single and enjoying the dating scene.","Melinda French Gates has opened up about her 2021 divorce from Microsoft co- founder Bill Gates.

CHANDIGARH: A man was allegedly murdered by his wife and her lover after he discovered their affair in Haryana’s Bhiwani district, police said. The accused, Ravina, a YouTuber, and her lover reportedly transported the victim's body on a bike and dumped it in a drain outside the city in March.Ravina, who has been arrested, was frequently involved in arguments with her husband, Praveen, over the videos and reels she posted on social media. The couple got married in 2017 and have a six-year-old son named Mukul.Ravina, a resident of Joodi village in Rewari district, had married Praveen, a resident of Gujron Ki Dhani near the old bus stand in Bhiwani. Praveen worked as a driver at a sand and gravel shop and struggled with alcohol addiction. The couple often quarrelled over Ravina’s social media activity.About a year and a half ago, Ravina reportedly developed a friendship with Suresh, a YouTuber from Premnagar village in Hisar district, through Instagram.According to police, on March 25, Praveen allegedly caught Ravina and Suresh in a compromising position at their home in Bhiwani. A heated argument followed. Later that night, Ravina and her lover allegedly strangled Praveen to death.To avoid suspicion, the duo transported Praveen’s body on a bike and dumped it in a drain on Dinod Road, outside the city. Three days later, during a search operation, the police and Praveen's family recovered his decomposed body from the drain.Investigators reviewed hundreds of CCTV clips from nearby localities. On the night of March 25, a suspicious bike was seen on camera near the family's garden. Footage also showed a man wearing a helmet and Ravina later sitting on the same bike, with what appeared to be a body placed between them.When Ravina was interrogated thoroughly, she confessed to the murder.

Records show Gene Hackman’s wife researched symptoms of illness days before her death

Newly released investigation records have shed light on the final days of veteran actor Gene Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa . Authorities disclosed emails, phone logs, and internet searches showing Arakawa was worried about flu-like symptoms before her death from hantavirus.Arakawa, 65, died from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome , a rare disease spread by rodents. Gene Hackman, aged 95, died roughly a week later from heart disease complicated by Alzheimer’s. Their partially mummified bodies were found on 26 February in their Santa Fe home by maintenance workers who alerted the police.According to the newly released report, Arakawa had been searching online for information on Covid-19, dizziness, and flu-like symptoms between 8 and 12 February. In one email to her massage therapist, she wrote that Hackman had shown signs of illness but tested negative for Covid-19. She said she was cancelling an appointment “out of an abundance of caution.”Phone records show Arakawa tried to contact a concierge medical service on the morning of 12 February. Investigators also checked security footage from local stores and reviewed voicemails and incoming calls to the couple's landline.Police bodycam footage — redacted to protect the couple’s dignity — showed a thorough search of the home. One of the couple’s dogs was found alive beside Arakawa’s body; another was found dead nearby, having died of dehydration and starvation. A third dog survived.Rodent droppings were found in outbuildings but not inside the home. Despite the couple’s efforts to remain private, the records were released following a court order.","Betsy Arakawa, 65, died from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare disease spread by rodents.

White House Press Secretary: President Trump's position on Harvard is ""grounded in common sense""

Harvard rebuffs demands, raises legal red flags

The White House on Wednesday defended its decision to freeze over $2 billion in federal funding to Harvard University , calling it “common sense” and suggesting that other Ivy League schools could face similar scrutiny.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the move came after Harvard failed to comply with a list of demands from the Trump administration, including changes to admissions policies and efforts to combat antisemitism.“The president’s position on this is grounded in common sense—the basic principle that Jewish American students, or students of any faith, should not be illegally harassed and targeted on our nation’s college campuses,” Leavitt said during a press briefing, adding that such discrimination had occurred at Harvard.Pressed by Fox News’ Peter Doocy on why Ivy League schools receive so much taxpayer funding , Leavitt called it “a very good question,” saying President Trump has raised the issue in talks with Harvard, Columbia, and other elite institutions.She further claimed that federal dollars were enabling “egregious illegal behavior,” accusing universities of both indoctrination and negligence in addressing antisemitism.“We have the antisemitism task force , which the president promised and delivered on,” she said. “A lot of Americans are wondering why their tax dollars are going to universities that allow such behavior to occur.”Although Leavitt did not confirm whether other Ivy League schools would be targeted next, she emphasized that the administration’s stance was “rooted in common sense.”Harvard University responded by rejecting the administration’s proposed agreement, calling it unconstitutional and beyond the federal government’s authority under Title VI .President Alan M Garber said the terms would give the government excessive control over campus expression and eliminate all diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs.“It makes clear that the intention is not to work with us to address antisemitism in a cooperative and constructive manner,” Garber said. “We have informed the administration through our legal counsel that we will not accept their proposed agreement.”","The White House on Wednesday defended its decision to freeze over $2 billion in federal funding to Harvard University.

Israeli raids displaced tens of thousands in the West Bank. Now few places to shelter remain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israeli-raids-displaced-tens-of-thousands-in-the-west-bank-now-few-places-to-shelter-remain/articleshow/120329877.cms,"AP file photo

TULKAREM : For weeks, the family had been on the move. Israeli troops had forced them from home during a military operation that has displaced tens of thousands of Palestinians across the occupied West Bank . After finding shelter in a wedding hall, they were told to leave again.""We don't know where we'll go,"" said the family's 52-year-old matriarch, who did not want to be identified for fear of reprisal. She buried her face in her hands.The grandmother is one of more than 1,500 displaced people in and around the northern city of Tulkarem who are being pushed from schools, youth centers and other venues because the people who run them need them back. It was not clear how many displaced in other areas like Jenin face the same pressure.Many say they have nowhere else to go. Israeli forces destroyed some homes.The cash-strapped Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the West Bank, has little to offer. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, the largest aid provider in the occupied territories, struggles to meet greater needs in the Gaza Strip while facing Israeli restrictions on its operations.Approximately 40,000 Palestinians were driven from their homes in January and February in the largest displacement in the West Bank since Israel captured the territory in the 1967 Mideast war.Israel says the operations are needed to stamp out militancy as violence by all sides has surged since Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack ignited the war in Gaza.Fears of long-term displacement Israel's raids have emptied out and largely destroyed several urban refugee camps in the northern West Bank, like Tulkarem and nearby Nur Shams , that housed the descendants of Palestinians who fled or were driven from their homes in previous wars.Israel says troops will stay in some camps for a year.People with means are living with relatives or renting apartments, while the impoverished have sought refuge in public buildings. Now that the Muslim holy month of Ramadan has ended, many are being told to leave.""This is a big problem for us, as the schools cannot be used for the displaced because there are students in them, and at the same time, we have a shortage of financial resources,"" said Abdallah Kmeil, the governor of Tulkarem.He said the Palestinian Authority is looking for empty homes to rent to families and plans to bring prefabricated containers for some 20,000 displaced. But it's unclear when they will arrive.Seven minutes to pack The matriarch said Israeli troops gave the family seven minutes to pack when they evicted them from the Nur Shams camp in early February. They left with backpacks and a white flag to signal they weren't a threat.Shelters were overcrowded. People slept on floor mats with little privacy, and dozens at times shared a few toilets and a shower.The family tried to return home when soldiers allowed people to go back and get their belongings. Days later, they were forced to leave again, and soldiers warned that their house would be burned if they didn't, the woman said.The family found a charity center that doubles as a wedding hall in a nearby town. Now, with the onset of wedding season, they have had to leave.When the family feels homesick, they walk to a hilltop overlooking Nur Shams.Palestinians sheltering in and around Tulkarem say they feel abandoned. Much of the aid they were receiving, such as food and clothes, came from the community during Ramadan, a time of increased charity. Now that has dried up.Israel's crackdown in the West Bank has also left tens of thousands unemployed. They can no longer work the mostly menial jobs in Israel that paid higher wages, making it harder to rent scarce places to stay.Iman Basher used to work on a Palestinian farm near her house in Nur Shams. Since fleeing, the day's walk there is too far to travel, she said. The 64-year-old was among dozens of people recently forced from another wedding hall. She now sleeps on a mat in another packed building.Basher said soldiers raiding her house stole about $2,000, money she had been saving for more than a decade for her children's education.An Israeli military spokesperson said the army prohibits the theft or wanton destruction of civilian property and holds soldiers accountable for what it called ""exceptional"" violations. The army said militants fight and plant explosives in residential areas, and soldiers sometimes occupy homes to combat them.'The scale of the displacement is beyond us' Aid groups said some displaced people are living in unfinished buildings, without proper clothes, hygiene, bedding or access to healthcare.""It's hard to find where the need is ... The scale of the displacement is beyond us,"" said Nicholas Papachrysostomou, emergency coordinator in the northern West Bank for Doctors Without Borders.The charity's mobile clinics provide primary healthcare, but there's a shortage of medicine and it's hard to get supplies because of Israeli restrictions and financial constraints by the West Bank's health ministry, he said.The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, plans to disburse $265 a month to about 30,000 of the most vulnerable displaced people, but there is enough money for only three months, said Hanadi Jaber Abu Taqa, head of UNRWA in the northern West Bank.The agency's money mostly goes to Gaza. Just over 12% of the funds it seeks from donors for this year will be allocated to the West Bank.Portable housing for the many displaced would only be a temporary fix. Some Palestinians said they wouldn't accept it, worrying it would feel like giving up their right to return home.Isam Sadooq had been helping 60 displaced people staying at a youth center in Tulkarem. Last month, he was told, by the people who run the center, that they should consider evacuating so children can resume sports.""If we cannot find them another place to live, what will be their fate?"" he said. ""They will find themselves in the street, and this is something we do not accept.""","More than 1,500 displaced people in and around the northern city of Tulkarem are being pushed from schools. The cash-strapped Palestinian Authority administers parts of the West Bank. Israel says the operations are needed to stamp out militancy as violence by all sides has surged.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120329970,imgsize-801171,width-400,resizemode-4/AP-file-photo.jpg"
Who is Letitia James? New York attorney general accused of mortgage fraud by Trump officials,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-letitia-james-new-york-attorney-general-accused-of-mortgage-fraud-by-trump-officials/articleshow/120327797.cms,"AP photo

‘Karma’: Letitia James facing potential prosecution over alleged mortgage fraud

Who is Letitia James?

Letitia James is a Democrat and has served as New York’s attorney general since 2019, according to PBS.

She is the first Black woman elected to statewide office in New York.

Known for her aggressive legal stance, James gained national attention after filing a civil fraud lawsuit against Donald Trump, the Trump Organisation, and several of its executives in 2022.

That case led to a $454 million judgment, which Trump is currently appealing. James has remained a visible figure in the courtroom and the media throughout the proceedings.

This year, she has launched at least five legal challenges against the Trump administration, including a coalition-led lawsuit opposing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)’s access to Treasury systems and a separate suit against federal funding cuts to universities.

The Trump administration has accused New York Attorney General Letitia James of mortgage fraud, escalating tensions between the two sides. The allegations were revealed in documents obtained by Fox News, showing that the FHFA has referred the matter to the department of justice for possible criminal investigation.The referral, signed by FHFA director William Pulte, highlights two key claims. First, that James falsely listed a Virginia property as her principal residence. Second, she misrepresented a New York property as a four-unit structure instead of five — which may have qualified her for different loan terms. There is also an allegation that she listed her father as her husband on past documents.","Letitia James is the first Black woman elected to statewide office in New York. She gained national attention after filing a civil fraud lawsuit against Donald Trump, the Trump Organisation, and several of its executives in 2022. The case led to a $454 million judgment, which Trump is currently appealing.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120328224,imgsize-26542,width-400,resizemode-4/Untitled-design-2025-04-16T080704-303.jpg"

Poll Do you agree with the Trump administration's decision to freeze funding for Harvard? No, it undermines academic independence. Yes, it's necessary for accountability.

What the Trump administration wanted from Harvard?

Harvard's response the demands

The Trump administration announced Monday it will freeze $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts for Harvard after the university refused to comply with its policy demands concerning changes in its policies.The mandates, issued in an April 3 directive, required changes to university governance, hiring and admissions processes, the closure of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) offices, and cooperation with federal immigration screenings for international students.The Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism that suspended the fundings and grants cited concerns about elite universities’ commitment to civil rights and responsible use of taxpayer funds. ""Harvard's statement today reinforces the troubling entitlement mindset that is endemic in our nation's most prestigious universities and colleges - that federal investment does not come with the responsibility to uphold civil rights laws,"" it said.""The disruption of learning that has plagued campuses in recent years is unacceptable. The harassment of Jewish students is intolerable. It is time for elite universities to take the problem seriously and commit to meaningful change if they wish to continue receiving taxpayer support,"" it added to it statement.In a letter dated April 11 to Harvard President Alan Garber, US officials accused Harvard of failing to uphold federal civil rights laws and academic standards that justify continued federal investment. The letter outlined a set of strict reforms the university must implement by August 2025. ""The United States has invested in Harvard University’s operations because of the value to the country of scholarly discovery and academic excellence. But an investment is not an entitlement. It depends on Harvard upholding federal civil rights laws, and it only makes sense if Harvard fosters the kind of environment that produces intellectual creativity and scholarly rigor, both of which are antithetical to ideological capture."" it said.""Harvard has in recent years failed to live up to both the intellectual and civil rights conditions that justify federal investment. But we appreciate your expression of commitment to repairing those failures and welcome your collaboration in restoring the University to its promise. We therefore present the below provisions as the basis for an agreement in principle that will maintain Harvard’s financial relationship with the federal government,"" it added while listing out the demands for the ivy league university which included governance and leadership demands, merit-based hiring reforms, international admissions reforms, discontinuation of DEI, whistleblower reporting and ensuring transparency.In its response, Harvard President Alan Garber declared the university would not “negotiate over its independence or its constitutional rights.” Garber claimed that while the university is committed to addressing discrimination, it rejects federal overreach into academic autonomy. “The University will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights,” Garber wrote in a message to the community, as per the Harvard Gazette. “No government — regardless of which party is in power — should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue,"" he added.Garber's response came after the government issued a list of requirements prior to announcing the funding freeze. These included detailed assessments of academic divisions and departments, evaluations of perspectives from students, faculty, and staff, as well as proposed changes to Harvard's administrative structure and recruitment procedures.Following the order, Harvard Law School professor Nikolas Bowie gave a statement to CNN’s News Central saying, “What the President of the United States is demanding of universities is nothing short of authoritarian."" “He is violating the First Amendment rights of universities and faculty by demanding that if universities want to keep this money, they have to suppress our speech and change what we teach and how we study,” he added.This action follows heightened tensions on campuses nationwide, particularly after pro-Palestinian protests erupted in response to Israel’s military operations in Gaza. Some demonstrations led to confrontations with law enforcement and pro-Israel counter-protesters.Republican leaders, including President Donald Trump, have equated certain activist groups with Hamas—the US-designated terrorist organization whose October 7, 2023 attack on Israel sparked the current conflict.In March, the US Department of Education launched investigations into 60 academic institutions over reports of anti-Semitic incidents.Despite revealing a £45 million operating surplus from £6.5 billion in revenue last fiscal year, Harvard firmly rejected demands it deemed excessive and outside federal authority. Garber reiterated that political interference in academic decisions is unacceptable, regardless of party affiliation.Representative Elise Stefanik, a New York Republican known for her staunch support of Jewish and Israeli causes, has been a vocal critic of Harvard’s leadership. She praised the funding freeze, calling Harvard emblematic of higher education’s decline.Unlike Harvard, Columbia University chose to comply with similar White House mandates, forfeiting $400 million in federal grants after failing to adequately protect Jewish students during protests. Columbia has since implemented new disciplinary policies and increased security measures.Meanwhile, immigration authorities have pursued action against Columbia-based pro-Palestinian organizers. Mahmoud Khalil is undergoing deportation proceedings, and Mohsen Mahdawi was detained during his US citizenship interview.","The Trump administration announced Monday it will freeze $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts for Harvard. The university refused to comply with its policy demands concerning changes in its policies. The mandates required changes to university governance, hiring and admissions processes, and cooperation with federal immigration screenings for international students.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120295596,imgsize-2156543,width-400,resizemode-4/article-91.jpg"

A moderate earthquake struck the Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan early Wednesday morning, with tremors felt across parts of the seismically active zone.According to the National Centre for Seismology (NCS), the earthquake measured 5.9 on the Richter scale and occurred at 4.43 am IST, with its epicentre located at latitude 35.83 N and longitude 70.60 E.The NCS also reported that the quake struck at a depth of 75 kilometres beneath the Earth's surface.While there were no immediate reports of casualties or large-scale damage, experts remain concerned about the impact on communities already vulnerable due to ongoing humanitarian challenges.Afghanistan is one of the most disaster-prone countries in South Asia. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) has repeatedly warned that Afghanistan remains highly exposed to natural hazards such as floods, landslides, and earthquakes.According to UNOCHA, frequent seismic activity continues to damage regions with weak infrastructure, saying, “These frequent earthquakes in Afghanistan cause damage to vulnerable communities, which are already grappling with decades of conflict and under-development and have left them with little resilience to cope with multiple simultaneous shocks.”Afghanistan's susceptibility to earthquakes stems from its position on several active fault lines, where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates meet.According to the Red Cross, the Hindu Kush mountain range, where the latest quake occurred, is especially active and experiences earthquakes on a near-annual basis. A significant fault line also runs through Herat province, further raising the risk of future tremors.",A moderate earthquake struck the Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan early Wednesday morning.

‘Due process’ criticized as legal obstruction

‘They’ve given their game away’

‘We will not stand for it’

US vice president JD Vance launched a scathing attack on former President Joe Biden’s immigration record on Wednesday, accusing him of allowing “approximately 20 million illegal aliens” into the United States and overwhelming public resources.“This placed extraordinary burdens on our country—our schools, hospitals, housing, and other essential services were overwhelmed,” Vance said on X, adding that many of the undocumented migrants “committed violent crimes, or facilitated fentanyl and sex trafficking.”Vance framed the immigration debate as a national emergency that the Trump administration has begun to correct. “The President has successfully stopped the inflow of illegal aliens, and now we must deport the people who came here illegally,” he declared.Vance rejected concerns over legal protections for migrants, arguing that deportations require far less legal scrutiny than criminal convictions. “To say the administration must observe ‘due process’ is to beg the question,” he said, adding that applying strict legal standards to deportation proceedings is a tactic meant to block enforcement altogether.“To put it in concrete terms,” he said, “imposing the death penalty on an American citizen requires more legal process than deporting an illegal alien to their country of origin.”Vance also accused the media and progressive critics of trying to normalize mass illegal immigration under the guise of defending human rights. “They want to accomplish through fake legal process what they failed to accomplish politically: the ratification of Biden's illegal migrant invasion,” he said.He challenged opponents of mass deportations to offer realistic alternatives, “Ask the people weeping over the lack of due process… does their solution allow us to deport at least a few million people per year? If the answer is no, they’ve given their game away.”Vance concluded with a vow that he and Trump would not allow what he described as a “deliberate effort to erase border enforcement” to continue.“President Trump and I will not stand for it,” he said.","US vice president JD Vance launched a scathing attack on former President Joe Biden’s immigration record on Wednesday.

allegations and political context

Harvard stands its ground

US President Donald Trump threatened to strip Harvard University of its tax-exempt status , intensifying an ongoing battle between the White House and the nation’s oldest and wealthiest university.The move came after Harvard rejected a list of policy changes demanded by the Trump administration, including shifts in hiring, admissions, and curriculum.Just a day earlier, the administration froze over $2 billion in federal funding to the university. According to a person familiar with the president’s thinking, Trump was angered by media coverage of Harvard’s defiance and decided to escalate the pressure campaign, reported NYT.Trump took to Truth Social and posted, ""Perhaps Harvard should lose its Tax Exempt Status and be Taxed as a Political Entity if it keeps pushing political, ideological, and terrorist inspired/supporting 'Sickness?' … Tax Exempt Status is totally contingent on acting in the PUBLIC INTEREST!""While White House officials noted that the IRS will decide independently on tax-exempt matters, Trump has privately indicated he’s committed to taking on Harvard. Losing its nonprofit status could cost the university billions of dollars over time.Lawrence Summers, former Treasury secretary and Harvard president, responded sharply, ""Selective persecution of your political adversaries through the tax system is the stuff of dictatorship… This is unconscionable and wrong.""Federal law prevents the president from directly ordering IRS investigations. The agency declined to comment, but experts cast doubt on any serious threat to Harvard’s status.Former IRS commissioner John Koskinen said, “The chances of getting the IRS to actually revoke the 501(c)(3) status of a major university are almost nonexistent… The problem is you're causing people to spend a lot of time and money responding and defending their actions.”Still, the mere prospect of litigation could be an intimidating burden, he noted.Though Trump’s 2017 tax bill already imposed a levy on large university endowments, Harvard’s broader tax-exempt status allows it to avoid major tax liabilities and attract massive charitable donations.Harvard’s $50 billion endowment is bolstered by tax-deductible gifts, often from wealthy donors like John Paulson and Ken Griffin.Summers warned that if Harvard’s tax status were revoked—however unlikely—“It would devastate progress in medical and scientific research, opportunity for the next generation of Americans, and an important magnet for the United States in the world.”Trump officials have accused elite universities of fostering antisemitism and suppressing speech. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, “Why are the American taxpayers subsidizing a university that has billions of dollars in the bank already? … And we certainly should not be funding a place where such grave antisemitism exists.”The funding freeze followed Harvard’s refusal last week to comply with administration demands for policy changes and regular progress reports. University president Alan Garber said in a statement:“No government—regardless of which party is in power—should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.”Harvard receives about $9 billion in federal support, with most routed through affiliated hospitals and the remainder funding research in areas like cancer, space exploration, and Alzheimer’s.While the school is financially fortified, other institutions have opted to comply with Trump’s conditions—Columbia University reportedly settled with the administration after facing similar pressure.",US President Donald Trump threatened to strip Harvard University of its tax- exempt status.

US president Donald Trump on Tuesday posted a video clip of Joe Biden ’s first public speech since leaving office. The post appeared on Trump’s Truth Social account — without a caption.The video showed Biden speaking recalling his own early exposure to racial segregation, saying he had never seen “black people” before moving to Delaware from Pennsylvania as a child. While telling the story, Biden used the outdated term “coloured kids”.“I remember seeing kids going by, at the time called ‘coloured kids,’ on a bus,” Biden said. He explained that this moment helped him understand the reality of racial injustice and shaped his political outlook.On social media, reactions poured in. One user wrote, “Biden can’t help himself. He’s been a racist all his life.” Another commented, “Perhaps Trump was saying this man didn’t have the capacity to make conscious decisions for the country.”In the same speech, Biden took aim at Republican lawmakers. “Social security is more than a government programme. It’s a sacred promise,” he said, accusing his opponents of trying to “cut and gut” it. He added, “Who the hell do they think they are?” before stopping himself and saying, “I’ll get in trouble.”Though Biden never mentioned Trump by name, he appeared to respond to past claims by Trump and Elon Musk about fraud in Social Security .",Donald Trump posted a video clip of Joe Biden ’s first public speech since leaving office.

FULL SPEECH: JOE BIDEN returns to speak at 2025 ACRD Conference in CHICAGO

In his first major public appearance since leaving the White House, former president Joe Biden accused his successor, Donald Trump, of causing deep harm to the social security administration. Speaking at a national conference for disability advocates, Biden said Trump had “taken a hatchet” to the agency, which provides benefits to tens of millions of Americans.“In fewer than 100 days, this new administration has done so much damage and so much destruction. It's kind of breathtaking,” Biden said. “They’ve taken a hatchet to the social security administration.”The speech came as Democrats across the country organised a “Social security day of action” to rally opposition against recent changes. Biden avoided naming Trump directly, referring to him instead as “this guy”. But his message was clear: he believes the Trump administration is undermining a critical safety net.""They're shooting first and aiming later,"" Biden alleged. “They want to wreck it so they can rob it,” he said. “Why do they want to rob it? In order to give tax cuts to billionaires and big corporations.”The social security administration has already faced job cuts and new identity-verification rules. A lawsuit has also been filed over the agency’s decision to give Elon Musk’s department of government efficiency access to sensitive personal data. Musk, a Trump adviser, has publicly criticised social security as a “Ponzi scheme”.Advocates like attorney Jason Turkish say the uncertainty is scaring people. “We go from Republican to Democrat... and there’s always been a belief that social security is just something we do not touch,” he said.White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt mocked Biden’s age, saying, “I'm shocked that he is speaking at nighttime.”Though Biden no longer holds office, Democratic leaders like Hakeem Jeffries believe his voice is still vital. “This is an all-hands-on-deck moment,” Jeffries said.Biden, who withdrew from the 2024, ended his speech with a call for unity and compassion. “We can’t go on like this as a divided nation,” he said. “It’s a 30% that has no heart.”","Former president Joe Biden accused Donald Trump of causing deep harm to the social security administration.

Who paid for the bond?



Amid a racial debate over the stabbing of Texas teen Austin Metcalf by black teen Karmelo Anthony, comparisons with Kyle Rittenhouse emerged. Anthony stabbed Austin Metcalf and claimed that it was an act of self-defense as Metcalf pushed him at a track event. Social media users who asked why Karmelo had a knife in his backpack were reminded that Kyle Rittenhouse had a gun and in 2020, at the age of 17, he shot two men dead during civil unrest on Wisconsin. Rittenhouse was later found not guilty of murder.The social media debate shifted focus to the race of the two teens and those supporting Karmelo are saying why people did not have a problem with Kyle Rittenhouse having an AR15. ""People out here asking why #KarmeloAnthony had a knife but had no problem with 17-year-old #KyleRittenhouse having an AR 15,"" one wrote on X.""Self defense was understood when it was Zimmerman. Self defense was understood when it was Goetz. Self defense was understood with Kyle Rittenhouse but #KarmeloAnthony brings confusion for people.

But Karmelo who shot a teenager spent only 12 days in jail and got his bond reduced.Karmelo Anthony walked out of the jail on Monday after his family paid the $250,000 bond. A judge agreed to lower it from $1 million. Over $420,000 has been donated to Anthony's family in an online fundraiser after Karmelo received threats.During the judge's ruling on Monday, prosecutors asked Anthony's dad why he couldn't use the donated money to pay the original bond to release his son from jail, the Sun reported.Andrew Anthony said the money was going to be used for legal defense and also for security to protect Anthony as the family was also planning to move into a new house for extra safety. Anthony's lawyers insisted the money raised online ""is not a bond fund"" and that the family needs the funds to get by because Anthony's dad is currently on leave from his job.Domique Alexander who claims to be a human rights activist said that pastor Corey C Toney, the owner of No Limit Bail Bonds, ""quietly stepped in and covered the entire bond for Karmelo Anthony -- free of charge"". ""He didn't ask for recognition. He didn't want the spotlight. But I believe it's important to celebrate people who show up when it matters most. This is what community looks like. We rise to the moment. We stand for what's right,"" Alexander posted.","Karmelo Anthony walked out of jail on Monday after his family paid the $250,000 bond.
