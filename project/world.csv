'Mamata Banerjee has turned Bengal into another Bangladesh': BJP

NEW DELHI: Fresh violence erupted in West Bengal on Monday when supporters of the Indian Secular Front (ISF) and police in South 24 Parganas clashed during protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act.Violence erupted when police stopped ISF workers from marching to a rally at Kolkata’s Ramlila Maidan, where ISF leader and Bhangar MLA Naushad Siddique was due to speak.The protestors, many from Bhangar, Minakhan, and Sandeshkhali, were blocked at Bhojerhat on the Basanti Highway. Tensions rose when they tried to break through barricades, sparking violent clashes. Several police vehicles were torched and officers injured. Police used batons to disperse the crowd, leaving at least one ISF supporter with a head injury.""Some police vehicles were set on fire by the protesters and a few police personnel were injured when the agitators attacked the law enforcers,"" a senior police officer said.The violence brought traffic to a standstill, prompting a heavy police deployment. Protesters were eventually cleared from the area.This comes days after three people were killed in Murshidabad during violent protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act. West Bengal Police arrested 150 individuals and deployed forces in Samserganj, Dhuliyan, Suti, and nearby areas.BJP MP Jyotirmay Singh Mahato urged Union home minister Amit Shah to impose AFSPA in several districts, citing deteriorating security and alleged targeted violence against Hindus. A special Calcutta high court bench ordered immediate deployment of central forces in Murshidabad following the unrest.Earlier today, West Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar visited a relief camp in Malda district, where hundreds of displaced families from Murshidabad have sought refuge after fleeing violence during protests over the Wakf Amendment Act. Majumdar, also the Union minister of state for education, visited the makeshift camp at Paralalpur High School in Kaliachak Block 3, where he interacted with the displaced families, many of whom were women and children. Local officials reported that 640 people have taken refuge in Malda, with 550 staying in the school and others in nearby villages.Majumdar shared that many women were deeply emotional, recounting how their homes were torched, property destroyed, and they received life threats. He alleged that ""fundamentalist forces"" disguised as protesters were behind the attacks in Dhulian, Murshidabad, which claimed three lives and left several injured.""Initially, 200-250 families had taken shelter here. Now, due to police pressure to shut down the camp and cover up Mamata Banerjee's failure, only 70-75 families remain. They are still living in fear,"" Majumdar alleged.""The situation in Murshidabad could be a precursor to similar unrest elsewhere in the state. Minister Siddiqullah Chowdhury has already issued a warning. Mamata Banerjee has turned Bengal into another Bangladesh,"" he added.Majumdar criticised the state government for bias, accusing them of restraining central forces. He also warned that the unrest in Murshidabad could spread to other regions in Bengal.","Violence erupted when police stopped ISF workers from marching to a rally at Kolkata’s Ramlila Maidan.

NEW DELHI: A petition was filed on Monday in the Supreme Court seeking a court-monitored SIT probe into the Murshidabad violence that broke out during the anti-Waqf law protests, reported LiveLaw.The plea, filed by advocate Shashank Shekhar Jha, also sought the top court's directions to protect the lives and properties vulnerable to the riots. Tension flared up in West Bengal’s Murshidabad district on Saturday morning after fresh protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act turned violent in Jangipur, with demonstrators torching multiple vehicles.Visuals from the area showed flames and smoke billowing from burning vehicles as security forces were deployed to restore order.Jawed Shamim, Additional Director General ( Law and Order ), said on Monday that both the Malda and Murshidabad administrations are working in coordination to ensure peace and facilitate the safe return of those who had fled their homes.“So far, 19 families have returned. Shops are opening and people are slowly resuming their normal routine,” Shamim said, adding that law enforcement agencies are focused on restoring calm in the affected regions.Emphasising the need to curb misinformation, Shamim warned residents against spreading or acting on unverified news. “We’ve arrested 210 individuals so far. Rumours can reignite tensions — I urge everyone to stay calm and check facts before reacting,” he said.Referring to the brutal killing of a father and son, Shamim said a separate case would be filed and all persons involved - both perpetrators and bystanders - would be held accountable.""It will take time to identify them precisely, but no one will be spared,"" he asserted. Police made loudspeaker announcements across the district on Monday morning, appealing to shopkeepers to reopen and urging people to return to their regular lives.“Our top priority is restoring complete normalcy, and we are confident that Murshidabad will soon be back to peace,” Shamim added.On Saturday, the Calcutta high court ordered the immediate deployment of Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) in the Murshidabad district, following deadly violence allegedly linked to protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act. At least three people died and over 100 were arrested in the escalating clashes that rocked the region.""The court cannot keep its eyes closed when such situations come up,"" a division bench led by Justice Soumen Sen observed, emphasizing the constitutional responsibility to ensure peace and protection for all citizens. The court was hearing an urgent petition on a court holiday, underscoring the gravity of the situation.","A petition was filed on Monday in the Supreme Court seeking a court-monitored SIT probe into the Murshidabad violence.

Details of the alleged plot



NEW DELHI: Fugitive jeweller Mehul Choksi made arrested in Belgium had made headlines four years ago when he had claimed abduction from the Caribbean island in May 2021. Later a detailed police report from Antigua supported his statement, identifying Hungarian national Barbara Jarabik and Gurdip Bath as prime conspirators in the plot. The report, accessed by TOI, provided a chilling account of the events that led to Choksi’s sudden appearance in Dominica .According to the report, Choksi was lured to a rented villa in Jolly Harbour by Barbara Jarabik under the pretense of a dinner invitation on May 23, 2021. Upon arrival, he was ambushed by a group of around 10 men, believed to be of Indian and local origin. He was reportedly gagged, bound to a wheelchair, and assaulted before being transported by boat to a yacht named Calliope of Arne and later taken to Dominica.Gurdip Bath, traveling on a Kittitian diplomatic passport, checked into Cocobay Hotel on May 19, 2021. Hotel staff later reported seeing him with a woman resembling Barbara Jarabik. Bath reportedly visited Jolly Harbour multiple times and was picked up by a man in a white Hyundai Creta shortly before Choksi’s alleged abduction.That same evening, Bath, Jarabik, and British national Leslie Farrow-Guy boarded a private flight to Dominica. Notably, the aircraft had arrived in Antigua with only its pilots and was scheduled to leave earlier but delayed its departure — a fact flagged by investigators.Bath had previously traveled to Antigua in April 2021, along with Jarabik, allegedly on a reconnaissance trip. They checked into the Blue Waters Hotel together.Barbara Jarabik, whose travel records show frequent visits to Antigua since 2019, had reportedly grown close to Choksi during her stays. She rented the villa in question a few days before the incident and had requested access to a private dock — which was used during the escape.Leslie Farrow-Guy, identified as a British national, had rented the same white Hyundai Creta used during the operation and had arrived in Antigua around the same time as the other suspects."," jeweller Mehul Choksi made headlines four years ago when he had claimed abduction from the Caribbean island in May 2021.

Perspectives from the Muslim community

The political kerfuffle

What’s at stake

""People I know are getting divided into Hindu-Muslim right in front of my eyes,"" lamented Debangshu Bhattacharya , the young TMC leader who popularized the iconicslogan. When the youth gets disheartened, it is obvious that the situation is dire. Debangshu's Facebook post came on the backdrop of three deaths in violent protests in West Bengal’s Murshidabad over the Waqf Amendment Act. The violence that erupted on Friday, 11th April continued well into Saturday, prompting the Calcutta High Court to order central forces to be stationed in sensitive areas. With conspiracy theories swirling and familiar script of blame game playing out, an emotive issue has once again engulfed sensitive Indo-Bangladesh border districts. The assembly elections are just a year away, and the government is already battling high-profile scams—including the teacher recruitment controversy— in such a situation the political ramifications of such a livewire issue cannot be ignored.The Union Government’s decision to amend the Waqf Act of 1995 has ruffled feathers of sections of the minority community. Waqf refers to properties donated for charitable purposes. These properties, which cannot be sold, are overseen by a(custodian). Several clauses in the new Waqf Amendment Act—renamed the UMEED Act—haven't gone down well. These include the abolition of “Waqf by user,” inclusion of non-Muslims on Waqf Boards , a new requirement that donors must be practicing Muslims for at least five years and must own the property, provision to appeal tribunal orders in the High Court, and the formation of separate boards for different sects.West Bengal, which has over 80,480 Waqf properties—second only to Uttar Pradesh’s 2.2 lakh—has witnessed widespread protests. Nationally, Waqf Boards control 39 lakh acres of land, with 21 lakh acres added between 2013 and 2025, a figure the Union Home Minister claimed reflects past misuse. According to Amit Shah, speaking in the Parliament, the 2013 amendments were politically motivated, and the current changes aim to rectify that.The protests began sporadically but escalated violently on 11th April. Prior to that, a viral video showing a Kolkata bus driver being forced to remove a saffron flag under pressure from Waqf protesters had already sparked controversy.Additionally BJP had shared a clip where State Minister Siddiqullah Chowdhury, also the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hindi leader, was heard allegedly claiming that his supporters can easily choke Kolkata if required.Preempting unrest, Mamata Banerjee had made her stance clear on April 9, just a day after mobs attacked a police van in Jangipur, Murshidabad. “You have been hurt. Have faith. Nothing in Bengal will divide us. We must live and let live,” Mamata said in an outreach to the minority community. Outlining the historical significance of the Muslim community in the state, she pledged to give them steadfast support. However, it failed to soothe frayed nerves. Just a couple of days later, violence erupted in Samsherganj, Dhulian, and Suti of Murshidabad, leading to the deaths of three people, including a father and son.On the 12th, West Bengal CM gave out a measured message amidst news of violence. Without mentioning the Waqf Act or the Muslim community, she asked for calm and claimed that the legislation wouldn't be implemented in the state. She wondered why riots were being instigated. Mamata claimed that some political parties were trying to use this issue to further their agenda and requested people not to fall into their trap.While Mamata may have promised that the Waqf Act won't be implemented in the state, experts are divided over the constitutional validity of such a claim. Former Supreme Court Justice Ashok Kumar Ganguly, when contacted by TOI Online, said that what Mamata Banerjee is saying is 'unconstitutional.' According to the former justice, the CM has the right to move the Supreme Court but, until the court gives an order, the state has to obey the law passed by the Union Government. He cited Article 256 of the Constitution, which mandates,Hence, Mamata Banerjee has limited scope to not cooperate with the Union government, he argued. This view is also seconded by eminent lawyer and Rajya Sabha member from CPIM, Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya. Bikash, who has just had a major legal victory over the state government in the SSC case—which led to 26,000 teachers losing their jobs—virtually laughed off CM's claim. He believes it was an irresponsible statement and didn't help cool tempers. According to Bikash, this was an issue that required community protest and not state government intervention.Practising Advocate in the Supreme Court, Nikhil Mehra had a more nuanced take. He told TOI Online that Mamata Banerjee may choose not to operationalise the Waqf Amendment Act. However, he laid out certain conditions—such as in cases where Waqf has acquired properties belonging to the central government, the state would have no authority if those properties are reclaimed. He emphasised that the law remains in force even if the state chooses not to operationalise it, and in the event of a change in regime, the incoming government would be in a position to enforce all its provisions effectively from the day it was signed by the President.In cases of land disputes, if the state is made a party, it raises the question of whether it can legally oppose the matter in court on the ground that the state will not enforce the Act, Advocate Mehra noted. He added that for Acts falling under the Concurrent List, a state can pass a contrary amendment—but only if it receives the President’s assent. West Bengal hasn't even attempted this because the President is unlikely to accept such an amendment.Beyond legalities, Banga Bhushan winner author Abul Bashar offered a cultural explanation, noting that donating to Waqf often serves as a workaround to the complexities of inheritance law. He defended Waqf Boards as essential support systems for widows, orphans, and the economically disadvantaged. While he endorsed peaceful protests, he warned against violence and urged Hindus to stand in solidarity. Bashar maintained that the protest is genuine and grounded in Islamic tenetsEducationist Miratun Nahar, when contacted, minced no words and said those who want to change the secular nature of the country have brought this act in a well-crafted and well-planned manner. For members of the Waqf Board, her appeal is to look for the welfare of the Board, the community, and the nation overall and not to fall into the trap of those who want to provoke. However, the veteran educationist reposed little faith in the politics of Mamata Banerjee and said that trusting her would be even more detrimental for the community.Trust, though, as a product, seems to be in short supply in West Bengal's politics. Days after the state government took BSF's help to get the situation under control, TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh made an outlandish claim in a press conference that some people may well have used BSF and other central agencies to bring 'outsiders' to foment communal tension in Murshidabad. Claiming to have received reports, Kunal Ghosh demanded a high-level probe to verify them. Despite over 150 arrests, the identity of the mastermind behind the riots remains unclear. The BSF has gone on record saying that petrol bombs were hurled towards them.According to BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari 's post on X, the elected lawmakers of TMC—who have won by ‘rigging’—have no agency, and hence the entire hardline forces in Murshidabad and Malda have shifted allegiance to PFI, SIMI, and ABT. The Leader of Opposition also gleefully shared an undated video on X where a Muslim individual is claiming that the community is not dependent on Mamata, but Didi (Mamata) is dependent on them for her political survival!Adhikari, who believes that CM should resign and elections should be held under President's Rule, has claimed that people from riot-affected Dhulian have crossed over to Baishnabnagar, Malda, fearing what he claims is ‘religious persecution.’Incidentally, TMC MP from Jangipur, Khalilur Rahaman, and Manirul Islam, MLA from Farakka, both have failed to pinpoint groups who were behind the attacks. Islam's house was attacked and ransacked in this violence. His family members had to take refuge elsewhere. Claiming that the police couldn't provide him security, Islam, like his colleague Khalilur, said that young boys were at the forefront of the attack. “If elected representatives are not safe, how can the common man be provided protection?” he told local media personnels.Union Minister Sukanta Majumdar has upped the ante, claiming on X that what is being witnessed is “Noakhali part 2,” a reference to pre-partition horrors. TMC, on its part, has gone into overdrive on social media, claiming that BJP is using fake images and videos to discredit the Mamata government and also to further divide society along communal lines.It is also highlighting the fact that violence has also erupted in Tripura over the Waqf protest, where BJP is in power. The saffron party in its part has cited the example of Assam with 40% minority where things have remained calm.What’s getting lost in this political mudslinging is the fact that Murshidabad is a district with 66.67% Muslim population according to the 2011 Census. The nearby district of Malda too has a Muslim population of over 50%. Both are districts bordering Bangladesh already witnessing political upheaval. Thus, discontent regarding the Waqf Act, if not tempered quickly, may continue to fester for long in these communally sensitive districts. The fact that TMC has not been traditionally strong here, only grabbing political power in recent years, makes Mamata’s job even more tricky. TMC organisation isn't particularly robust with many of the leaders' turncoats from other parties. The party will look to ensure that Muslims, who have been their dedicated voter base for over a decade in the state, don’t look for other options while also assuaging the sentiments of the majority Hindu community. That's the delicate balancing act Mamata led government has to do in the run up to the elections. The BJP will be itching to use incidents like Waqf riots to earn the confidence of the Hindu community, who so far have partially reposed faith in the Mamata government mainly due to its welfare schemes.All eyes are currently on April 16, when the CM is set to meet Muslim clerics to figure out a roadmap. On the same day, the Supreme Court will take up the Waqf case for hearing. A possible breakthrough on either front can cool down the temperature. Else, people of Bengal may have to brace for a heated political summer!","West Bengal has over 80,480 Waqf properties, second only to Uttar Pradesh’s 2.2 lakh.

KOLKATA: Violence linked to the new waqf law escalated in Bengal on Monday, enveloping Bhangar on the outskirts of Kolkata as mobs took over the streets and unleashed a barrage of bricks that left at least 16 police officers wounded.The trigger for the street anarchy in Bhangar, a volatile pocket with a history of political violence, was police preventing Indian Secular Front (ISF) rallyists from heading to Kolkata's Ramlila ground for a rally against the waqf law, report Dwaipayan Ghosh & Sukumar Mahato.The sight of cops being outnumbered in Bhangar contrasted with a crackdown in flashpoint Murshidabad, where 11 FIRs were registered and the number of arrests exceeded 200.Police rounded up over 50 of the suspects in Murshidabad overnight, based on accounts of how mobs barged into homes since Friday night and targeted people. Suspension of internet was extended to pockets of Malda and Birbhum districts, contiguous to the strife-torn belts.One of the 11 FIRs was based on a complaint by Pompa Das, whose husband Chandan and septuagenarian father-in-law Hargodindo were among the three casualties in the communal violence. She described how a mob dragged the duo out of their home in Jatrapara and lynched them while the helpless family watched in horror from their rooftop.DGP Rajeev Kumar said the situation at Dhulian and other violence-ravaged parts of Murshidabad, which also reported 2 suspected abductions and injuries to many, was now ""fully under control"".CM Mamata Banerjee appealed ""with folded hands"" to all communities not to get provoked. ""Today, on the eve of Poila Baisakh, I urge everyone to peacefully exercise their democratic rights (to protest) with prior permission,"" the CM said.""But remember, whoever you are, A, B, C or D, do not take law in your own hands. Some people may instigate you but do not be provoked... They (her detractors) vilify me, going to the extent of even changing my surname. Which type of people would do this? Religion should not be used for playing irreligious games.""In Bhangar, the latest flashpoint of waqf protests on the outskirts of Kolkata, vehicles ferrying ISF supporters had been first stopped near Bairampur on Basanti highway. The stand-off escalated into violence as police allegedly used batons against the protesters. A similar attempt by cops from Bhangar division and Kolkata police reserve battalion at Shonpur in Bhangar fuelled the mob fury. Around 2,000-odd protesters later blocked Basanti highway for four hours. Lalbazar, Kolkata police headquarters, cited intelligence on ""ISF mobilising crowds"" as the reason for restricting gatherings in the city centre.At the Sealdah rally, ISF legislator Naushad Siddiqui questioned the police intervention. ""The CM has said the new waqf law won't be implemented in this state. We also don't want it to be implemented. That's why we organised the rally in Sealdah. Why did the police obstruct our workers from going there?""Mayor Firhad Hakim advised protesters to direct their actions towards Delhi. ""Why are they staging a drama here and inconveniencing people? When we take to the streets and block roads, it causes trouble for everyone. If you want to protest, the best thing to do is to organise a collective call to go to Delhi. Protests should be held where the waqf law has been implemented or will be implemented in those states,"" he further added.Violence was also reported Monday in Siliguri city of north Bengal, with a couple of RAF battalions being deployed in the Jyoti Nagar area after two groups clashed during the Charak festival.

NEW DELHI: Calling the BJP-RSS ""enemies"" of Ambedkar, and stating that Ambedkar had blamed V D Savarkar for his election defeat in 1952, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge said PM Modi should read the letter that the framer of the Constitution wrote to his friend about his defeat.

""They are enemies of Ambedkar, and did not respect him when he was alive. They condemned Ambedkar's conversion to Buddhism by mocking that 'Buddha has become SC',"" he said.

'What about Palm Sunday?': Canadian PM Mark Carney accused of 'pandering' to Sikhs on Vaishaki,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-about-palm-sunday-canadian-pm-mark-carney-accused-of-pandering-to-sikhs-on-vaishaki/articleshow/120164887.cms,"Sikh-Canadian Influence and the Political Battleground



The Conservative Counter-Strategy



A Delicate Balancing Act



Prime Minister Mark Carney is facing online criticism after taking part in Vaisakhi celebrations in Ottawa this weekend without publicly recognising Palm Sunday , which fell on the same day.Photographed wearing a yellow turban and serving food at a Sikh langar, Carney’s presence at the festival drew praise from members of the Sikh community—but also sparked backlash from some Christian commentators and right-leaning influencers who accused him of selective outreach. Notably, social media figure Oli London criticised Carney on X (formerly Twitter) for participating in Sikh festivities while failing to acknowledge Palm Sunday, a key Christian holiday marking the beginning of Holy Week.“This is the Prime Minister of Canada celebrating Vaisakhi in a Sikh temple—but not even mentioning Palm Sunday,” London wrote, igniting a polarised debate online. Critics accused Carney of “pandering” to minority communities while ignoring the Christian majority, with one user calling him “a shell of a person.” Others pointed out his silence on Passover as well.Yet many defended the prime minister’s participation. “Langar is inclusive—it’s for everyone, regardless of religion,” said one supporter. “That’s the spirit of Vaisakhi.”The incident shines a light on the growing influence of Sikh-Canadians in the political landscape. With over 800,000 Sikhs—roughly 2% of the population—Canada is home to the largest Sikh diaspora outside India. The community has become a potent political force, with visible representation in Parliament, provincial legislatures, and local councils.Both the Liberal and Conservative parties have actively courted the Sikh vote in recent years. The Liberals have long benefited from support in urban Sikh strongholds, especially in British Columbia and Ontario, but the Conservatives are making inroads—particularly as tensions grow over issues like the Khalistan movement and Indo-Canadian security concerns.This broader context is key to understanding the political sensitivity of Carney’s appearance. While the Liberal Party emphasises multicultural engagement, critics argue that its support for Sikh causes, particularly amid the fallout of the Hardeep Singh Nijjar assassination and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s explosive allegation against India, has alienated sections of the Hindu-Canadian and Indo-Caribbean communities.Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre has been cultivating ties with Hindu-Canadians and right-leaning members of the Indo-Canadian community—many of whom now feel disillusioned with Trudeau’s Liberals. In 2022, Poilievre attended a gathering hosted by Aditya Tawatia, a former organiser of the Overseas Friends of BJP Canada, a diaspora group originally set up to support Narendra Modi's rise to power in India. Though no longer active, some of its members continue to engage in Canadian politics—now often aligned with Poilievre’s Conservatives.These connections have sparked controversy, especially as some attendees of Poilievre’s events have raised concerns about perceived bias in favour of Sikh activists and a lack of action on threats to Hindu places of worship. “Hindu-Canadians don’t feel safe,” said Shiv Bhasker, a Poilievre supporter and former OFBJP official, citing incidents of intimidation at temples and rallies.Meanwhile, Sikh groups accuse the Conservatives of cosying up to Indian nationalist figures and using diaspora politics for electoral gain. “It is really concerning if those are the individuals now promoting candidates,” said a spokesperson for the Sikh Federation of Canada .The debate over community outreach took a sharper turn earlier this year when the Conservatives dropped their candidate in Etobicoke North, Don Patel, over controversial social media activity involving Khalistan. While Patel’s defenders insisted the reaction was overblown, the episode highlighted the tightrope both parties walk in managing their Indo-Canadian base—a group increasingly caught between diplomatic crossfire and domestic political ambition.Carney, who took over the Liberal leadership in early 2025, has styled himself as a bridge-builder and pragmatic centrist. His appearance at the Vaisakhi event was meant to reinforce that image. But in a multicultural democracy where overlapping religious calendars are the norm, even symbolic gestures can be politically loaded.With elections looming, both parties are jostling for the loyalty of Canada’s diverse ethnic communities. For Liberals, that means doubling down on inclusive symbolism and minority representation. For Conservatives, it means reorienting outreach efforts to tap into communities frustrated with Liberal identity politics and foreign policy.In this atmosphere, Carney’s turban and tray of dal may have said more than any speech could. Whether that symbolism resonates or backfires will depend on how Canadians interpret the balance—or imbalance—of their leaders’ cultural diplomacy .",Prime Minister Mark Carney is facing online criticism after taking part in Vaisakhi celebrations in Ottawa this weekend.

Who was Sankaran Nair?



What happened in Jallianwala Bagh

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday hailed Kerala-born Sankaran Nair for his legal battle he fought against the British Empire after the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre that took the lives of over 1000.Hailing Nair for his endeavour to seek justice for the civilians killed on orders of British general Reginald Dyer , PM Modi said every child in Punjab, Haryana and Himachal should know about him.""We must learn about the contributions of Sankaran Nair from Kerala . Every child in Punjab, Haryana, and Himachal should know about him,"" PM Modi said while addressing a gathering in Haryana's Yamuna Nagar .PM Modi's appeal comes when a movie, ""Kesari 2"", based on Sanakaran's legal battle against the Crown, is set to be released on April 18.Chettur Sankaran Nair (11 July 1857 – 24 April 1934) was a distinguished Indian lawyer, judge, and statesman who played a pivotal role in India's struggle for independence.Born in Mankara, Palakkad district of present-day Kerala, he pursued his education in law at Madras Law College, embarking on a legal career that would see him ascend to some of the highest judicial and political positions available to Indians under British rule.As the sole Indian member of the Viceroy's Executive Council, Nair resigned in 1919 to protest the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, marking a significant moment in India's freedom struggle.The Jallianwala Bagh massacre occurred on April 13, 1919, in Amritsar, Punjab, when British troops under Brigadier General Reginald Dyer opened fire on a peaceful gathering of thousands of unarmed Indians protesting against the Rowlatt Act. The troops blocked the only exit and fired for about ten minutes, killing over 1,000 people and injuring many more.The massacre, which took place on the festival of Baisakhi, shocked the nation, leading to widespread outrage, the resignation of key Indian figures from British honors (like Rabindranath Tagore), and a significant boost to the Indian independence movement. It remains one of the darkest chapters in colonial history and is commemorated at the Jallianwala Bagh Memorial in Amritsar.","PM Narendra Modi hails Kerala-born Sankaran Nair for his legal battle against the British Empire after the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre.

The war has displaced millions and triggered famine. Hosted by several nations and organizations, the conference aims to provide relief, focusing on aid delivery. Despite the severity, neither the Sudanese government nor the rival Rapid Support Forces were invited.

LONDON: Diplomats and aid officials from around the world are meeting Tuesday in London to try to ease the suffering from the 2-year-old war in Sudan, a conflict that has killed tens of thousands of people, displaced 14 million and pushed large parts of the country into famine.The one-day conference, hosted by Britain, France, Germany, the European Union and the African Union, has modest ambitions. It is not an attempt to negotiate peace, but an effort to relieve what the United Nations calls the world's worst humanitarian crisis.Attendees include officials from Western nations, international institutions and neighboring countries - but no one from Sudan. Neither the Sudanese government nor the rival paramilitary it is fighting has been invited.""The brutal war in Sudan has devastated the lives of millions - and yet much of the world continues to look away,"" said British Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who visited Chad's border with Sudan in January. ""We need to act now to stop the crisis from becoming an all-out catastrophe, ensuring aid gets to those who need it the most.""Sudan plunged into war on April 15, 2023, after simmering tensions between the Sudanese military and a paramilitary organization known as the Rapid Support Forces. Fighting broke out in the capital, Khartoum, and spread across the country, killing at least 20,000 people - though the number is likely far higher.Last month the Sudanese military regained control over Khartoum, a major symbolic victory in the war. But the RSF still controls most of the western Darfur region and some other areas.The war has driven parts of the country into famine and pushed more than 14 million people from their homes, with more than 3 million fleeing the country, to neighboring countries including Chad and Egypt. Both sides in the war have been accused of committing war crimes.The World Food Program says nearly 25 million people - half of Sudan's population - face extreme hunger.Aid agency Oxfam said the humanitarian catastrophe risks becoming a regional crisis, with fighting spilling into neighboring countries. It said that in South Sudan, itself wracked by recent war, ""the arrival of people fleeing Sudan's conflict has put more pressure on already scarce resources, which is deepening local tensions and threatening the fragile peace.""The U.S., which recently cut almost all its foreign aid, is expected to be represented at the London conference.Ahead of the meeting, Lammy announced 120 million pounds ($158 million) in funding for the coming year to deliver food for 650,000 people in Sudan, from Britain's increasingly limited foreign aid budget.In February the U.K. cut its aid budget from 0.5% of Gross Domestic Product to 0.3% to fund an increase in military spending. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said Sudan, along with Ukraine and Gaza, will remain a priority for British aid.","Sudan plunged into war on April 15, 2023, after simmering tensions between the Sudanese military and a paramilitary organization.

Hamas offers to release all Israeli hostages if war ends and prisoners are swapped,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/hamas-offers-to-release-all-israeli-hostages-if-war-ends-and-prisoners-are-swapped/articleshow/120283799.cms,"Hamas has proposed releasing all Israeli hostages in exchange for a comprehensive prisoner swap, the end of the Gaza war, and the withdrawal of Israeli forces. A senior Hamas official blamed Israel for obstructing ceasefire progress. Efforts to establish a new truce have stalled due to disagreements over the number of hostages to be released, while Hamas refuses to disarm.

Hamas on Monday said that it is willing to release all Israeli hostages in exchange for a “serious prisoner swap” and a commitment from Israel to end the war in the Gaza Strip.Taher al-Nunu, a senior Hamas official, told AFP on Monday, “We are ready to release all Israeli captives in exchange for a serious prisoner swap deal, an end to the war, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip and the entry of humanitarian aid.”He accused Israel of stalling progress towards a ceasefire, saying, “The issue is not the number of captives, but rather that the occupation is reneging on its commitments, blocking the implementation of the ceasefire agreement and continuing the war.” He added that Hamas insists on guarantees to ensure Israel abides by any future agreement.According to Israeli news outlet Ynet, a new proposal has been discussed in which Hamas would release 10 living hostages in return for a US guarantee that Israel would enter negotiations for the second phase of the ceasefire deal.The first phase of the ceasefire began on January 19 and involved several rounds of hostage-prisoner exchanges, but it collapsed after two months. On March 18, Israel resumed airstrikes in Gaza, effectively ending the truce. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that combat operations had resumed “in full force,” and that the airstrikes were “just the beginning.”Negotiations to restart a truce have stalled, reportedly due to disagreements over the number of hostages Hamas is willing to release. Meanwhile, Hamas has refused to disarm, which remains one of Israel’s key conditions for ending the war. “The weapons of the resistance are non-negotiable,” Nunu said.The war began after Hamas launched an attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, killing 1,218 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli government figures. Militants also took 251 hostages, with 58 still believed to be held in Gaza, including 34 that the Israeli military says are dead.The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry reported on Sunday that at least 1,574 Palestinians have been killed since 18 March, bringing the total death toll since the war began to 50,944.","Hamas has proposed releasing all Israeli hostages in exchange for a comprehensive prisoner swap.

R. Ambedkar's birthplace under police supervision, following a dispute between two groups in a village in Madhya Pradesh.The event occurred on Monday, coinciding with the birth anniversary celebrations of the Constitution's principal architect and social reformer Ambedkar, who was born on April 14, 1891, in Mhow, Indore district of Madhya Pradesh.According to eyewitness accounts and social media footage, the groom arrived with his wedding procession and guests at the temple in Sanghvi village, situated 25 km from Mhow, and offered prayers alongside family members whilst police maintained presence.Police officials dismissed allegations of the Dalit man being barred from temple entry, stating that the disagreement centred on access to the sanctum sanctorum, which local customs restrict to priests only.Social media platforms displayed various recordings of the incident. One video showed the groom, accompanied by his marriage procession and baraatis, engaged in a discussion with individuals reportedly from a privileged caste outside the temple.Following the controversy, police authorities released an official statement explaining the situation.""A rumour that a Dalit groom was prevented from entering the temple in Sanghvi village in the Betma police station area is being circulated on social media, which is misleading. The groom and his family went to the temple and prayed. After this, the wedding procession was taken out peacefully,"" statement said.The statement indicated that upon receiving reports of the disagreement between wedding party members and the other group, police personnel arrived at the location and settled the matter by explaining the temple's sanctum sanctorum entry protocols to both parties.The wedding procession continued to its intended destination after completing the temple prayers, according to the official statement.Betma police station in-charge Meena Karnawat said, ""In Sanghvi village, no one stopped the groom from a Scheduled Caste to enter the temple. The 'baraati' side was talking about entering the temple's sanctum sanctorum, where according to local traditions, only priests are allowed. No devotee goes inside the sanctum sanctorum of this temple.''The groom was identified as a member of the Balai community.Manoj Parmar, president of the All India Balai Mahasangh, said, ""Due to the frustrated mentality of some people, our community still has to face caste discrimination in rural areas.

'Investment is not an entitlement': Trump admin freezes $2.2 billion in grants to Harvard,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-administration-freezes-2-2-billion-federal-funding-over-white-houses-campus-anti-semitism-mandate/articleshow/120294516.cms,"Harvard University in Cambridge (File photo)

What the Trump administration wanted from Harvard?

Harvard's response the demands

The Trump administration announced Monday it will freeze $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts for Harvard after the university refused to comply with its policy demands concerning changes in its policies.The mandates, issued in an April 3 directive, required changes to university governance, hiring and admissions processes, the closure of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) offices, and cooperation with federal immigration screenings for international students.The Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism that suspended the fundings and grants cited concerns about elite universities’ commitment to civil rights and responsible use of taxpayer funds. ""Harvard's statement today reinforces the troubling entitlement mindset that is endemic in our nation's most prestigious universities and colleges - that federal investment does not come with the responsibility to uphold civil rights laws,"" it said.""The disruption of learning that has plagued campuses in recent years is unacceptable. The harassment of Jewish students is intolerable. It is time for elite universities to take the problem seriously and commit to meaningful change if they wish to continue receiving taxpayer support,"" it added to it statement.In a letter dated April 11 to Harvard President Alan Garber, US officials accused Harvard of failing to uphold federal civil rights laws and academic standards that justify continued federal investment. The letter outlined a set of strict reforms the university must implement by August 2025. ""The United States has invested in Harvard University’s operations because of the value to the country of scholarly discovery and academic excellence. But an investment is not an entitlement. It depends on Harvard upholding federal civil rights laws, and it only makes sense if Harvard fosters the kind of environment that produces intellectual creativity and scholarly rigor, both of which are antithetical to ideological capture."" it said.""Harvard has in recent years failed to live up to both the intellectual and civil rights conditions that justify federal investment. But we appreciate your expression of commitment to repairing those failures and welcome your collaboration in restoring the University to its promise. We therefore present the below provisions as the basis for an agreement in principle that will maintain Harvard’s financial relationship with the federal government,"" it added while listing out the demands for the ivy league university which included governance and leadership demands, merit-based hiring reforms, international admissions reforms, discontinuation of DEI, whistleblower reporting and ensuring transparency.In its response, Harvard President Alan Garber declared the university would not “negotiate over its independence or its constitutional rights.” Garber claimed that while the university is committed to addressing discrimination, it rejects federal overreach into academic autonomy. “The University will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights,” Garber wrote in a message to the community, as per the Harvard Gazette. “No government — regardless of which party is in power — should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue,"" he added.Garber's response came after the government issued a list of requirements prior to announcing the funding freeze. These included detailed assessments of academic divisions and departments, evaluations of perspectives from students, faculty, and staff, as well as proposed changes to Harvard's administrative structure and recruitment procedures.Following the order, Harvard Law School professor Nikolas Bowie gave a statement to CNN’s News Central saying, “What the President of the United States is demanding of universities is nothing short of authoritarian."" “He is violating the First Amendment rights of universities and faculty by demanding that if universities want to keep this money, they have to suppress our speech and change what we teach and how we study,” he added.This action follows heightened tensions on campuses nationwide, particularly after pro-Palestinian protests erupted in response to Israel’s military operations in Gaza. Some demonstrations led to confrontations with law enforcement and pro-Israel counter-protesters.Republican leaders, including President Donald Trump, have equated certain activist groups with Hamas—the US-designated terrorist organization whose October 7, 2023 attack on Israel sparked the current conflict.In March, the US Department of Education launched investigations into 60 academic institutions over reports of anti-Semitic incidents.Despite revealing a £45 million operating surplus from £6.5 billion in revenue last fiscal year, Harvard firmly rejected demands it deemed excessive and outside federal authority. Garber reiterated that political interference in academic decisions is unacceptable, regardless of party affiliation.Representative Elise Stefanik, a New York Republican known for her staunch support of Jewish and Israeli causes, has been a vocal critic of Harvard’s leadership. She praised the funding freeze, calling Harvard emblematic of higher education’s decline.Unlike Harvard, Columbia University chose to comply with similar White House mandates, forfeiting $400 million in federal grants after failing to adequately protect Jewish students during protests. Columbia has since implemented new disciplinary policies and increased security measures.Meanwhile, immigration authorities have pursued action against Columbia-based pro-Palestinian organizers. Mahmoud Khalil is undergoing deportation proceedings, and Mohsen Mahdawi was detained during his US citizenship interview.","The Trump administration announced Monday it will freeze $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts for Harvard after the university refused to comply with its policy demands.

Watch: Elephants at San Diego Zoo form protective huddle during earthquake to shield calves,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-elephants-at-san-diego-zoo-form-protective-huddle-during-earthquake-to-shield-calves/articleshow/120294980.cms,"Watch: Elephants at San Diego zoo huddle to protect calves during earthquake

As a 5.2-magnitude earthquake shook Southern California on Monday morning, a herd of African elephants at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park instinctively sprang into action to protect their young, forming a defensive huddle that was captured on video.Footage from the enclosure shows the elephants calmly standing under the morning sun when the ground begins to tremble. Startled, they first scatter, then quickly regroup as the older matriarchs — Ndlula, Umngani, and Khosi — close ranks around the two calves, Zuli and Mkhaya. The adult elephants hold their formation, ears spread and alert, for several minutes even after the shaking stops.“They sort of freeze as they gather information about where the danger is,” said Mindy Albright, curator of mammals at the park.The incident, which highlights elephants’ powerful social bonds and protective instincts, occurred around 10:10 a.m. near Julian, the quake's epicenter. While the tremor was felt as far as Los Angeles and Tijuana and caused boulders to tumble onto rural roads, no major injuries or damage were reported.According to Albright, the elephants' reaction is typical of their behaviour in the wild. When threatened, elephant herds often form an “alert circle” — young in the centre, adults facing outward — to defend against potential dangers. In the video, one calf runs straight to the safety of the adults, while the male calf, Zuli, hesitates on the edge, showing a streak of youthful independence. He is gently coaxed back by Khosi, who taps him reassuringly with her trunk.“It's so great to see them doing the thing we all should be doing — that any parent does, which is protect their children,” Albright said.About an hour later, when an aftershock hit, the elephants briefly huddled again before returning to their normal routine, staying close together in a show of continued solidarity.","A 5.2-magnitude earthquake shook Southern California on Monday morning.

Vetting does not end once a visa is granted



How does one's visa get revoked?



With green card holders now fearing their stay in the US after Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil's arrest for leading anti-Israel protests last year, Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said that revoking visas when threats arise is a way to make America safer. In an opinion piece for Fox News, Marco Rubio wrote that visiting America is not an entitlement and as the Secretary of State, he will never forget that it is a privilege extended to those who respect laws and values.Rubio said that US laws are clear about who can and cannot come to the United States. Each visa application is vetted through those rules and people who ""endorse or espouse"" terrorist activity or ""persuade others to endorse or espouse terrorist activity"" are ineligible for US visas.Revoking visas is not any highhandedness on the part of the Trump administration, he explained as he said the Immigration and Nationality Act gives the administration a broad authority to revoke a visa. ""This authority is fundamental to safeguarding our national security, as well as protecting Americans and lawful visitors within our borders. The Trump administration’s commitment to security and the enforcement of our immigration laws is unprecedented and unwavering. We expect – and the law requires – all visa holders to demonstrate their eligibility every day their visa is valid. This includes respecting our laws, behaving appropriately according to their visa type, and continuing to meet these standards throughout their stay in our country,"" he wrote.Marco Rubio explained in his piece that once a visa is granted, it is not forever. The US government's rigorous security vetting does not end once a visa is granted. And evert US visa holder should know this, Marco Rubio said. ""Working together with DHS and other law-enforcement and security agencies, we continuously monitor and review these cases. This vigilance is essential because circumstances can and do change,"" he wrote.Marco Rubio gave examples of incidents like a violent crime or drunk driving or supporting terrorism, overstaying the time permitted for their visit, performing illegal work etc for revoking the visas. ""When information about such activities comes to the department’s attention, our expert staff review it and assess whether revocation is appropriate,"" he wrote.""There are over 1.1 million foreign students in the United States, including at our nation’s most elite universities. In the aftermath of the October 7, 2023 terrorist attacks against Israel, some of these foreign student visitors engaged in antisemitic activities and intimidation of Americans, many who happened to be of the Jewish faith. These foreigners shut down college campuses for American citizens, harassed Jewish students, blocked highways, and stormed buildings. The Trump administration is committed to taking the necessary steps to stop these activities at American universities,"" Rubio wrote.US visas are a privilege, rather that a right and it's reserved for those who make the United States better, the secretary of state said.","Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US government's rigorous security vetting does not end once a visa is granted.

The Supreme Court ruled that if El Salvador wants to return him … we would facilitate it: meaning, return a plane,” Bondi who was also present at the Oval Office during the meeting said.White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller also pointed out that Abrego Garcia is a citizen of El Salvador, suggesting it was “very arrogant” for American media to “tell El Salvador how to handle their own citizens.”",El Salvador president Nayib Bukele said he does not have the power to return Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia who was mistakenly deported to his country back to the US.

Latest hearing in Tufts student Rumeysa Ozturk's ICE deportation case

Rumeysa Ozturk , a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, who was detained by US immigration authorities in March over ""antisemitism on campus"", has described the conditions in the detention facility as “inhumane” and “unsafe.”Rumeysa Ozturk, 30, was arrested by US immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) agents near her home in Somerville, Massachusetts, on March 25. She was walking to meet friends to break her Ramadan fast when masked officers surrounded her. “I was speaking to my mother on the phone when several men approached me on the street and then surrounded me and I screamed,” she said in court filings, according to USA today.Ozturk was taken without being allowed to call her lawyer. “They didn’t let me make any calls, and they asked me to put the phone into flight mode,” she said. “It was an isolated place with four men, and it was terrifying.”Initially held in Vermont, Ozturk was transferred to a facility in Pine Prairie, Louisiana, against a judge’s order. There, she says conditions have been unbearable. “The conditions in the facility are very unsanitary, unsafe, and inhumane,” she said. “There is a mouse in our cell... They don’t give us adequate hygiene supplies.”She also accused a nurse of forcibly removing her hijab. “She said, ‘You need to take that thing off your head’ and took off my hijab without asking my permission,” Ozturk said. She also reported asthma attacks and said medical staff offered little more than ibuprofen.The department of homeland security claims Ozturk supported Hamas, a designated terrorist group, and said this justified her detention. But she has not been formally charged.US district Judge William Sessions called her detention a “potential constitutional crisis” and questioned the legality of ICE’s actions. Ozturk says she only wants to return to her studies: “I pray every day for my release so I can go back to my home and community in Somerville.”Ozturk was one of four students who wrote an op-ed in the campus newspaper, The Tufts Daily, last year criticising the university’s response to student activists demanding that Tufts “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide,” disclose its investments and divest from companies with ties to Israel.","Rumeysa Ozturk, 30, was arrested by US immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) agents near her home in Somerville, Massachusetts, on March 25.

US president Donald Trump blamed former president Joe Biden’s immigration policies for the 2023 murder of Maryland mother Rachel Morin.Trump on Monday in a social media post said, “Moments ago, the illegal criminal, who was allowed into our country by crooked Joe Biden, was convicted of the heinous murder of Rachel Morin. Rachel was a beautiful mother of five from Maryland, and her life was taken at the hands of a monster who should have never been here in the first place.""""The fake news should be focusing on the beautiful life and tragic death of this Maryland mother, rather than the so-called “Maryland father,” who is actually an MS-13 gang member and foreign terrorist from El Salvador. We will never forget Rachel Morin, and are committed to protecting women like her across our country. We will deport illegal murderers, rapists, and criminals. Make America great again!"" he added.Martinez-Hernandez, who illegally entered the United States from El Salvador in 2023, was found guilty of first-degree premeditated murder, rape, and kidnapping. He was arrested nearly 10 months after Morin’s body was discovered near a popular trail in Harford County, Maryland. Prosecutors confirmed his ties to criminal gangs and announced they will seek a life sentence without parole.This comes at a time when his administration is under fire for a separate case involving Salvadoran national Kilmar Abrego Garcia. Garcia, who had lived in the US since 2011, was deported by immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) in March despite a 2019 judge’s ruling that protected him from removal. The deportation was later declared illegal by US. courts. The supreme court upheld this on April 10, 2025, ordering the US government to bring Garcia back.Attorney general Pam Bondi said the US would provide a plane for Garcia’s return if El Salvador released him from prison. However, Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele rejected the idea. “How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States?

Immigration agents detained Palestinian student Mohsen Mahdawi at a US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) office in Vermont on Monday, just as he arrived for his citizenship interview. Mahdawi, a Columbia University student and activist, was arrested after a decade-long stay in the US, where he had obtained a green card.He had been a vocal leader in the anti-Israel protests on Columbia’s campus, which likely drew the attention of the Trump administration's immigration enforcement efforts.In a video shared on social media, Mahdawi, hands shackled, is seen being escorted by federal agents to an unmarked vehicle. His attorney, Luna Droubi, called the arrest unlawful, stating, ""He came to this country hoping to be free to speak out about the atrocities he has witnessed, only to be punished for such speech.""Mahdawi, who led the Palestinian student union at Columbia, has been a target of criticism and scrutiny due to his pro-Palestinian activism. He told The Intercept, “It’s kind of a death sentence... because my people are being killed unjustly in an indiscriminate way.” He explained that his past activism, especially his role in protesting Israel’s actions in Gaza, had made him a target of immigration enforcement.Mahdawi had been hiding after his friend and fellow protester Mahmoud Khalil was detained by immigration authorities, fearing his own arrest. The USCIS had moved his citizenship interview from December to this week, which raised suspicions that the meeting was part of a setup. Mahdawi’s fears were realized when he was arrested as he attended the interview.His attorney filed a habeas corpus petition on his behalf, arguing that the government’s actions violated his due process rights. A federal judge has since issued a temporary restraining order, preventing Mahdawi from being moved out of Vermont while his case is pending.Mahdawi has expressed that he believes his deportation to the West Bank, where violence and unrest are escalating, would effectively be a ""death sentence.""

Why Kilmar Abrego Garcia won't be returned to the US despite Supreme Court order.

What is the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia?



Why Garcia won't return to the US



The White House meeting between President Donald Trump and El Salvador president Nayib Bukele Monday made one thing clear that Maryland man Kilmar Abrego Garcia who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador won't be returned to the US. After this hit the headlines and the Trump administration had to face brickbats for it, the White House slammed the media and said describing Kilmar as a Maryland man is wrong as he is an illegal immigrant.On March 12 this year, Garcia, a Salvadoran citizen but who was living in the US for the past 14 years, was detained by ICE and was deported to El Salvador as the Trump administration identified him as a gang member of MS-13. Garcia arrived in the US illegally in 2011 as he fled persecution by gangs. An immigration judge ruled in 2019 that he couldn't be deported because of the risk of gang-related persecution.As the case reached the court after he was deported, the court said there was not adequate evidence to prove that he was a member of MS-13. The Trump administration labeled the deportation an “administrative error”. U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ruled on April 4, 2025, that his deportation was illegal and ordered his return, calling the action “wholly lawless.” The Supreme Court upheld this on April 10, 2025, directing the government to “facilitate” his return.Attorney General Pam Bondi said US would send a plane to El Salvador to take Garcia if El Salvador releases him from the prison. “Additional paperwork had needed to be done. That’s up to El Salvador if they want to return him. That’s not up to us. The Supreme Court ruled that if El Salvador wants to return him … we would facilitate it: meaning, provide a plane,” Bondi said in front of Trump and Bukele.Nayib Bukele said it was a preposterous idea to release a prisoner. He also said he does not have the right to release a prisoner and then sneak him back to the United States. “I hope you’re not suggesting that I smuggle a terrorist into the United States,” Bukele said. “How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States? Of course I’m not going to do it. The question is preposterous.”","Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran citizen, was deported to El Salvador on March 12 this year.

What did Trump administration demand from Harvard?



Harvard University took a bold step in resisting the Donald Trump administration's demands, knowing that it would affect its funds. In a detailed statement, the university said the administration issued an updated and expanded list of demands, warning that Harvard must comply if we intend to “maintain [our] financial relationship with the federal government.”Some of these demands are aimed at combating antisemitism but the majority are to regulate the ""intellectual conditions"" at Harvard, the university said.""The administration’s prescription goes beyond the power of the federal government. It violates Harvard’s First Amendment rights and exceeds the statutory limits of the government’s authority under Title VI. And it threatens our values as a private institution devoted to the pursuit, production, and dissemination of knowledge. No government—regardless of which party is in power—should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue,"" the university said.""Harvard remains open to dialogue about what the university has done, and is planning to do, to improve the experience of every member of its community. But Harvard is not prepared to agree to demands that go beyond the lawful authority of this or any administration,"" it said in its letter to the administration.By August 2025, Harvard must make meaningful governance reform and restructuring to make possible major change consistent with this letter, including: fostering clear lines of authority and accountability, Trump administration's letter said. Reforms include reducing the power held by students and unteneured faculty, reducing administrators more committed to activism etc.The University must adopt and implement merit-based hiring policies, and cease all preferences based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin throughout its hiring, promotion, compensation, and related practices amongfaculty, staff, and leadership, it said.The University must immediately shutter all diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, offices, committees, positions, and initiatives, under whatever name, and stop all DEI-based policies, including DEI-based disciplinary or speech control policies, under whatever name; demonstrate that it has done so to the satisfaction of the federal government.","Harvard says it won't give in to Trump administration, won't accept the demands.

Baloch separatists kill 8 Pakistanis in Iran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/baloch-separatists-kill-8-pakistanis-in-iran/articleshow/120262403.cms,"ISLAMABAD:

Eight Pakistani car mechanics were shot dead in Iran late Saturday, sparking outrage and deepening fears that the country was becoming a hub for anti-Pakistan militants after Afghanistan.Balochistan National Army (BNA), a lesser-known separatist group, claimed responsibility for the attack in Sistan-Baluchestan province, escalating tensions between the neighbouring countries as Pakistan demanded swift action. The eight workers hailed from Punjab -- Pakistan’s most populous province -- and were killed at a workshop in Mehrestan district, near Afghanistan’s border, Pakistani authorities said.BNA framed the killings as retaliation against perceived Punjabi dominance in Balochistan’s economic and political spheres. “We will not allow outsiders to exploit our land and resources,” BNA said in an online statement, echoing long-standing Baloch grievances over resource exploitation and marginalisation. The outfit has aligned itself with the broader Baloch insurgency led by groups like Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA).Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif called the attack “barbaric”. “We demand the perpetrators be brought to justice swiftly,” he said, urging Tehran to act. Sharif ordered the foreign ministry to help the victims’ families and repatriate the bodies. Foreign minister Ishaq Dar issued a similar condemnation. “This attack challenges our sovereignty. We cannot allow our citizens to be targeted abroad,” Dar said.Iran’s response was measured but conspicuously vague. Ambassador Reza Amiri Moghadam condemned the killings as “inhumane and cowardly”, calling terrorism a “chronic plight” that demands regional cooperation. Yet, Tehran offered no concrete assurances of cracking down on groups like BNA, prompting scepticism in Islamabad.Thousands of Pakistanis, particularly from economically deprived areas, travel to Iran on a regular basis to take up informal jobs in sectors such as vehicle repairs, construction, and agriculture.In Jan 2024, nine Pakistani labourers were killed and three critically injured in a similar attack in Saravancity, also located in Iran’s southeastern border region. Like in the latest killings, the victims in that case worked in an automobile repair shop. These murders occurred at a time when Pakistan and Iran were attempting to repair diplomatic relations after tit-for-tat missile and drone attacks.","Balochistan National Army (BNA), a lesser-known separatist group, claimed responsibility for the attack.

Poll Do you believe that Pakistan is adequately prepared for earthquakes? No Yes

A moderate-intensity earthquake with a magnitude of 5.8 struck Pakistan at around 1 pm on Saturday, with tremors felt in Jammu and Kashmir.Tremors were felt across many parts of the Valley, but there were no immediate reports of casualties or property damage. The earthquake occurred at a depth of 10 kilometres, with coordinates of 33.63 degrees North latitude and 72.46 degrees East longitude.According to the National Center for Seismology (NCS), the recent earthquake struck at a shallow depth of 10km, increasing the likelihood of aftershocks.Shallow earthquakes are typically more dangerous than deeper ones because the seismic waves travel a shorter distance to the surface, causing stronger ground shaking and potentially more damage to structures and higher casualties.Pakistan, located on the boundary of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates, is one of the most seismically active countries. The nation frequently experiences destructive earthquakes due to its position on major fault lines. Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, and Gilgit-Baltistan lie on the southern edge of the Eurasian plate, while Sindh, Punjab, and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir are on the north-western edge of the Indian plate. The collision of these plates makes the region highly susceptible to violent earthquakes.Earlier, Pakistan’s neighbor Tajikistan was also jolted by a 4.2 magnitude earthquake.","A moderate-intensity earthquake with a magnitude of 5.8 struck Pakistan at around 1 pm on Saturday, with tremors felt in Jammu and Kashmir.
