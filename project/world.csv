The accused allegedly targeted individuals in the US, UK, Australia, and other countries.A police officer said the youths were recruited specifically for their distinct English accents to deceive foreign victims. The detainees were reportedly working in what appeared to be call centres. During the midnight raid, many workers managed to flee, taking advantage of the darkness and what was described as an insufficient police presence.This first-of-its-kind anti-cybercrime operation followed four months of surveillance. The offices, spread across different buildings without signboards, were staffed by individuals from outside Andhra, mostly from northeastern states.Many of the suspects claimed ignorance of the fraud, claiming they had joined only a week earlier and were still in ""employee induction"" phase.Police said they had not yet identified the kingpin. Located 80 km from Visakhapatnam, Atchutapuram has evolved into an industrial hub, featuring apartment complexes and group houses. Cops said the fraudsters carefully selected certain buildings to avoid suspicion.Initial probe revealed the suspects were lured by monthly salaries ranging from Rs 20,000 to Rs 30,000. ""We thought it was a call centre. Most of them were always on their phones, and many of the flats had computers,"" a local said.Sources identified three distinct roles among the suspects: some acted as bankers managing deposits, others handled transactions, and the rest were involved in defrauding foreigners directly.","Police busted a Myanmar and Cambodia-style cybercrime network operating out of half a dozen buildings near Atchutapuram SEZ and industrial area in Andhra Pradesh's Anakapalli district.

His death comes as govt forces ramp up coordinated offensives across Maoist strongholds, putting unprecedented pressure on the dwindling movement.The 70-year-old Basavaraju's death has created a major void in CPI (Maoist)'s top ranks, especially within apex decision-making bodies - central committee and politburo. Focus now shifts to succession, with two seniors emerging as frontrunners: Mallojula Venugopal alias Sonu, and Thippiri Tirupati alias Devji.Venugopal, 69, a Brahmin from Telangana with a BCom degree, is viewed as a seasoned ideologue. He previously served as party spokesperson and remains a key political strategist.Tirupati, 60, hails from Telangana's Madiga scheduled caste community and sits on the Maoist group's central military commission. A senior Telangana police officer said his rise reflects internal discontent over upper-caste dominance in leadership.""There was growing pressure within the organisation to ensure caste diversity in leadership. It now remains to be seen whether the party sticks to that line or opts for a more politically seasoned figure like Venugopal,"" the officer said.Other names in circulation include Kadari Satyanarayana Reddy, though he lacks influence, and Malla Raji Reddy, considered too old and arrested earlier.Analysts said Basavaraju's death could further fragment an already weakened insurgency. The next general secretary will inherit a demoralised cadre split between calls for peace talks, urban operations, and continued armed struggle.Former chief Ganapathy remains underground but disconnected. Leaders like K Ramchandra Reddy, Misir Besra, and Pothula Kalpana remain under heavy surveillance.With top commanders under pressure and ranks in disarray, the Maoist movement faces a critical juncture in leadership and direction.","Killing of CPI (Maoist) general secretary Basavaraju in a gunfight Wednesday left the outlawed insurgent group without a leader.

Madras high court stays Tamil Nadu law changes allowing vice-chancellors appointments by CM,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/madras-high-court-stays-tamil-nadu-law-changes-allowing-vice-chancellors-appointments-by-cm/articleshow/121324825.cms,"Education should be in the hands of an authority above politics, says TN in HC

CHENNAI: A vacation bench of Madras high court Wednesday clamped an interim stay on operation of amendments to 10 state university laws empowering the CM to appoint vice-chancellors, effectively wresting what is the governor's prerogative in the capacity of chancellor.The contentious provision, which was deemed to have received Supreme Court's assent based on its ruling defining gubernatorial powers, triggered a rare presidential reference recently and a renewed Centre-state power tussle. The bench of Justice G R Swaminathan and Justice V Lakshminarayanan passed the interim orders on a PIL filed by advocate K Venkatachalapathy, challenging the amendments on the ground that these were contrary to the objectives of UGC regulations and functions.""Through Regulation 7.3 of the UGC Regulations for teaching staff, the commission granted power to the chancellor (Governor) to appoint VCs...,"" the PIL states.However, the state, through the amendments, replaced the power of the chancellor with the govt, which is contrary to the process stipulated for appointing VCs,"" the PIL states.""State universities are recognised as universities within Sec 2 (f) of the UGC Act and also recognised by the commission under the applicable regulations. Therefore, any amendments made by state affecting such universities, especially in areas already covered by regulation concerning appointment of VCs, constitute a violation of constitutional distribution of powers,"" it argues.Senior advocate Dama Seshadri Naidu, representing the petitioner, contended at Wednesday's hearing that universities must be protected from political powers. ""The chancellor is apolitical, like a speaker of an assembly... Education should be in the hands of an authority above politics,"" he said.Advocate general P S Raman and senior advocate P Wilson, representing the state, argued that a legislation brought by the govt after getting it passed in the assembly could be stayed only in the event of ""a glaring unconstitutionality or if it is manifestly arbitrary"". ""In the present case, a state legislation prevails over regulations framed by UGC,"" the AG said.So long as it does not contravene a law legislated by Parliament, the state law prevails, he added. Wilson sought an adjournment, saying a petition to transfer all related cases to SC was pending and that arguing the matter now before HC would leave the pending pleas infructuous. He said there was no urgency for a vacation bench to hear the PIL, and requested the court to adjourn the hearing and provide time for the state to file a counter.Wilson accused governor R N Ravi of ""waging war"" against DMK govt. ""The PIL is politically motivated. Except for a grudge to stay the selection process, there is no urgency in issue. Only the process for appointment of vice-chancellors has commenced. The last date for applications is June 5.""

NEW DELHI/RAIPUR: CPI (Maoist) chief Nambala Keshava Rao , alias Basavaraju - mastermind of some of the deadliest Maoist attacks in the country - was killed in Chhattisgarh 's Narayanpur on Wednesday in an intelligence-based operation conducted by the state police's District Reserve Guard (DRG).Twenty-six other Maoists were also eliminated. A massive haul of modern weapons and explosives was recovered. One DRG man was killed in the encounter that broke out in Boter village and the jungles of Lekawada.Apart from being a founder member of the outfit, born from the merger of People's War (PWG) and MCC in 2004, 70-year-old Basavaraju was part of its top decision-making/strategising bodies like the politburo, central committee and central military commission. He operated with extreme stealth, having been spotted only a few times in Abujhmarh region and on a handful of occasions, outside.Basavaraju, who carried a cumulative bounty of over Rs 10 crore declared by NIA and various state govts, would shuffle between different 'combat zones' and act as a bridge between the cadre and the brass. A trained engineer, he would often be part of ambushes. Not surprisingly, his body was found with an AK-47 next to it.Home minister Amit Shah confirmed his death and referred to him as ""the backbone of the Naxal movement"". ""The outfit is now headless,"" a senior intel officer told TOI, hailing his killing as the biggest success against Maoists in the last 25 years.Though Maoists had lately been haemorrhaging, having lost hundreds of their cadre and many of their top members in combats with security forces, Basavaraju's death will rank as one of the most severe blows.""Modi govt has resolved to eliminate Naxalism before March 31, 2026,"" Shah said while applauding the ""brave"" security forces and agencies for the breakthrough. He added that after completion of the 21-day Operation Black Forest on May 11, 54 Naxalites had been arrested and 84 had surrendered across Chhattisgarh, Telangana and Maharashtra. The PM too hailed the ""remarkable success"". ""Our govt is committed to eliminating the menace of Maoism and ensuring a life of peace and progress for our people,"" he posted on X.It was also celebrated by Chhattisgarh CM Vishnu Deo Sai. ""More surrenders are bound to follow,"" he told TOI while commending DRG personnel for their bravery. The personnel in DRG, largely comprising surrendered Maoists, enjoy the advantage of being familiar with the Abujmarh terrain as well as with the Naxals' operational tactics.Basavaraju, an engineer and alumnus of REC (now NIT), Warangal, was an 'operations' man who believed in military-style assault, understood technology and was a proponent of extreme violence. The attacks planned under him were deadly, with Hidma, who leads the PLGA battalion No. 1, executing them to a T, former CRPF DG K Vijay Kumar told TOI.News of Basavaraju's killing began swirling in the morning. The confirmation came after diligent verification and was immediately celebrated. ""We have got him, it is him,"" a senior officer involved in the operation said.Deputy CM and home minister Vijay Sharma said the operations went on for 72 hours. It was preceded by elaborate planning over 15 days before state police got confirmation of Basavaraju's presence in Orchha region of Abujhmarh. According to a police officer, they gathered inputs from Andhra Pradesh police and surrendered cadres to zero in on Basavaraju.Police learnt that Basavaraju was among a clutch of top Maoist functionaries camping in Abujhmarh, protected by hardcore PLGA cadres and senior Marh division members. Once their camp was located, DRG teams set out from four districts - Narayanpur, Dantewada, Bijapur and Kondagaon.Gunfights broke out in a patch of dense jungle, some 15-20 km from Orchha. The guns fell silent on Wednesday when the Maoists broke off and retreated.A police statement said several other senior-level Maoist cadres were either killed or seriously injured in the encounter. It would take 24 hours for the troops to return, and more details would be known then.","Nambala Keshava Rao, alias Basavaraju, mastermind of some of the deadliest Maoist attacks in the country, was killed in Chhattisgarh.

Tourism hit as ‘New Baba Vanga’ warning triggers mass cancellations

Official warnings and government response

Social media buzz and public reaction





A Japanese manga artist known for her unsettlingly accurate predictions has sparked widespread concern, leading to a surge in travel cancellations to Japan., often called, has captured global attention for her chilling predictions, including a major disaster anticipated for July 2025. With a track record that reportedly includes predictions of the devastating 2011 Tohoku earthquake and the death of iconic figures, Tatsuki’s latest prediction has left travellers reconsidering their plans, citing fear, anxiety, and a desire to avoid potential danger.The impact of her warning is already being felt in the travel industry, with agencies reporting significant drops in bookings as the feared date approaches. Airlines, hotels, and tour operators are bracing for continued losses. Here, you can explore Tatsuki's predictions, her history of accurate foresight, and the response from concerned travellers seeking reassurance or alternative destinations.Ryo Tatsuki is a Japanese manga artist whose prophetic claims have drawn comparisons to the late Bulgarian mystic Baba Vanga, known for her eerily accurate predictions about global events. Tatsuki first gained attention in 1999 with the release of her booka compilation of visions she claims to have experienced over the years.While the book initially received little mainstream attention, several of Tatsuki’s predictions have reportedly come true, earning her a devoted following in Japan and beyond.Some of her most notable forecasts are catastrophic March 2011 earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan’s northern Tohoku region. This disaster, which claimed over 18,000 lives and triggered the Fukushima nuclear crisis, occurred in the same month and year Tatsuki had predicted. Her book also allegedly foresaw the 1995 Kobe earthquake and the death of legendary Queen frontman Freddie Mercury, adding to her reputation as a modern-day seer.In a revised edition ofpublished in 2021, Tatsuki issued a stark warning about a potentially catastrophic event set to strike in July 2025. According to CNN and other media reports, Tatsuki’s prophecy describes a massive undersea rupture forming between Japan and the Philippines, capable of generating tsunamis three times the height of those seen during the 2011 Tohoku disaster.Her prediction includes unsettling imagery of Japan’s oceans “boiling,” which some interpret as a possible reference to an underwater volcanic eruption or a massive seismic event. The epicenter of this anticipated disaster is drawn as a diamond-shaped region connecting Japan, Indonesia, Taiwan, and the Northern Mariana Islands – a part of the Pacific known for its intense geological activity.Reports indicate that Tatsuki’s prophecy has already started to influence travel behavior, particularly among tourists planning to visit Japan in the coming months. According to Hong Kong-based travel agency WWPKG, bookings to Japan dropped by as much as 50 percent during the recent Easter break, a trend expected to continue as the feared date draws closer.Speaking to CNN, CN Yuen, managing director of WWPKG, noted that concerns over Tatsuki’s prediction have been compounded by recent advisories from the Chinese embassy in Tokyo. In a statement issued in April 2025, the embassy warned Chinese nationals in Japan to remain vigilant against potential natural disasters, further fueling anxiety among travelers.The Chinese government’s warning was reportedly prompted by a series of recent seismic events and increased volcanic activity around Japan’s coastline. The South China Morning Post reported that the advisory urged residents and tourists to “take extra precautions against natural disasters,” a statement that many interpreted as an indirect acknowledgment of the growing fears surrounding Tatsuki’s prediction.Japanese authorities, however, have been more reserved in their response, focusing on reassuring the public about the country’s extensive disaster preparedness infrastructure. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) has not issued any specific alerts related to the July 2025 timeframe, emphasizing that its seismic monitoring systems remain among the most advanced in the world.Social media platforms have become hotbeds of speculation and debate, with the hashtag #July2025Prediction trending across multiple countries. Some users have expressed deep concern, while others have dismissed the claims as mere coincidence or sensationalism. Online forums dedicated to earthquake preparedness have also seen a surge in activity, with members sharing safety tips and evacuation plans in case of a worst-case scenario.","Ryo Tatsuki is a Japanese manga artist whose prophetic claims have drawn comparisons to the late Bulgarian mystic Baba Vanga.

The White House has finally reacted to President Donald Trump’s controversial post about Taylor Swift



President Donald Trump has constantly been making controversial comments about Taylor Swift



Taylor Swift and the newly elected President Donald Trump have been in the news for their contrasting political opinions for a couple of years now. While Taylor Swift publicly supported Donald Trump’s opponent, Kamala Harris, last year, President Trump has often dragged the pop star into many controversies. Recently, President Donald Trump made a pretty derogatory post on Truth Social about Taylor Swift and the White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt recently reacted to it.As White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt took questions from the media, Fox News’ Peter Doocy asked her about President Donald Trump’s recent post about the billionaire pop star.Hearing this, Karoline Leavitt laughed at the question and said, ""Look, he is speaking about Taylor Swift's political views and how perhaps it has impacted the support of the American public for her work.

Instagram post of the Puri YouTuber

The Odisha Police have started an investigation into the alleged links between a Puri-based YouTuber and 'Pak spy' Jyoti Malhotra. On Saturday, May 17, Haryana Police arrested YouTuber Jyoti Malhotra on the charge of passing sensitive information to Pakistani intelligence operatives. Jyoti Malhotra runs a YouTube channel, Travel with JO. She is said to be in contact with an employee named Danish working at the Pakistan High Commission in Delhi. On May 13, India had expelled the Pakistani official for indulging in espionage.The Odisha Police did not disclose the identity of the Puri YouTuber for its investigation into the matter.A team of police personnel visited the Youtuber's residence in Puri for an investigation into the matter. According to Police, Jyoti Malhotra visited Puri in Odisha in September 2024 and came in contact with a woman who is also a YouTuber. The Puri SP Vinit Agrawa said that the Youtuber had also travelled to Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara in Pakistan recently. “We found that Jyoti Malhotra had visited Puri last year, and we are verifying the fact. Anything more can be shared after the verification,” Agrawal said.Asked whether the woman from Puri had shared intelligence inputs with Malhotra, Agrawal said, “The Haryana Police are investigating the matter and we are providing them the required assistance.” The police are also ""examining the objective"" of Malhotra's visit to Puri, and trying to find out ""where she stayed, whom she contacted and any possible suspicious activities"", the Puri SP said.In a social media post, Puri YouTuber wrote, “Jyoti was just a friend of mine, and I came in contact with her through YouTube. I was unaware of anything which she is accused of. I would not have been in touch with her if I knew she was spying for enemy Pakistan.” She added, “If any investigative agency wishes to cross-question, I would provide full cooperation. Nation is above all. Jai Hind.”The YouTuber has now made her Instagram account private, which means that only users she approves as followers can see the content on her Instagram page now.The Puri-based content creator does not have a huge following. She has 14,600 subscribers on YouTube and 20,000 followers on her Instagram account. The number is way less than that of Jyoti Malhotra. She has posted videos of her exploring places in Odisha, and other parts of the country.In March this year, the Puri YouTuber had posted a video of her visit to Pakistan on her YouTube channel.","Haryana-based travel vlogger Jyoti Malhotra, known for her YouTube channel 'Travel With Jo,' has been arrested on charges of spying for Pakistan.

Kettering Health patient's claim scam calls

Kettering Health , a major healthcare provider in the region, confirmed Tuesday morning that a cyberattack caused a system-wide technology outage, impacting thousands of patients and employees across its facilities. The organization identified the issue as resulting from ""unauthorized access"" to its network and is working with a third-party cybersecurity firm to address the attack and restore systems.The outage has disrupted operations at Kettering Health’s medical centers, though physician office visits remain unaffected. Elective inpatient and outpatient procedures have been canceled and will be rescheduled, with care teams reaching out to affected patients. Emergency rooms and clinics continue to operate, ensuring critical care remains available. However, the organization’s call center is also offline due to the attack.“We understand this is frustrating for our patients and concerning for those with family members in our care,” Kettering Health stated. “We have procedures in place to ensure safe, high-quality care despite this disruption.”Local emergency services, including Harrison Township and the Miami Valley Fire District (MVFD), are diverting patients to other hospitals, such as those in the Premier Health Network, until Kettering Health restores full operations. “We’re giving them time to handle this internally,” said Harrison Township Fire Chief Mike Christ. “We’ll resume transports when they’re ready.”Adding to the chaos, Kettering Health has received reports of scam calls targeting patients. Callers posing as Kettering Health representatives have requested credit card information for medical expenses. The organization clarified that while it typically contacts patients about payments, it has suspended such calls out of caution and emphasized that these scam calls are not linked to the cyberattack.Patients receiving suspicious calls are urged to report them to local law enforcement.

I thought my life was over. People were screaming, praying and panicking,” Ghose said. She praised the pilot for managing the landing under difficult conditions, adding that the nose of the aircraft appeared damaged upon arrival.Footage circulated on social media shows visibly shaken passengers praying and bracing themselves as the plane shook violently.The TMC team is scheduled to visit Srinagar, Poonch and Rajouri during their stay in Jammu and Kashmir, which continues until 23 May.The party says the visit aims to express solidarity with civilians affected by cross-border violence and to meet families who have lost loved ones in recent attacks."," Trinamool Congress leader Sagarika Ghose describes a harrowing flight to Srinagar.

BENGALURU: Panathur, whose crater-filled roads compete with that of Moon, has only one wish: Let VIPs visit the layout every now and then. And its years-long civic problems vanish in days.In a move that stunned residents, BBMP officials descended on the pothole-ridden stretch between Kadubeesanahalli and Varthur, filling craters and cleaning drains ahead of chief minister Siddaramaiah's city tour on Wednesday.The CM was in the area for a rain-damage inspection around 3pm, but his presence worked like magic as from Tuesday evening itself the civic officials scrambled to clean the roads, patch potholes, and clear silt — transforming what was once a slush-filled, accident-prone mess into a presentable route, just in time for his arrival.Locals, mostly tech professionals who've long endured official apathy, were both amused and exasperated. Taking to social media, they posted tongue-in-cheek appeals: ""Please visit our area more often, Mr CM… Our roads and lives improve instantly!"" The residents said the complaints on crumbling roads, open drains, and encroached footpaths had fallen on deaf ears.Residents ask why no such positive action happened when people from all age groups came out in protest for basic amenities like roads and drainage.Pavitra Holla, another resident of Panathur-Balagere who actively initiates public movements, said, ""All these years when we asked them to at least clean the silt, they said they don't have a mechanical sweeper. Then how did they get one now? How did they get the manpower overnight? This means that our lives and money don't matter here for them. Now today, the CM came, and everything was possible for them. How pathetic.We protested, wrote hundreds of letters, and made countless calls to BBMP officials, and none bothered, but today one message about the CM's visit was all it took.""I've been living in this area for eight years, and I've never seen work happening this fast. Just because the CM and the deputy CM were visiting, things moved overnight. Roads that were full of potholes got wet, drains were cleaned, garbage that sat for days was cleared, and the whole stretch from Kadubisanahalli to Balagere looked neat for the first time.For the past few months, they've dug up roads, supposedly for various reasons, and then just left it incomplete. The place was in complete disrepair. But suddenly, just because the Chief Minister was visiting, everything started happening overnight.For the first time, I saw heavy machinery, loads of workers more than I've ever seen in all these years. This wasn't even permanent work, just cosmetic fix. Still, even if the CM visited once a month, maybe our roads would at least be somewhat usable.",Panathur's crater-filled roads compete with that of Moon.

First aid trucks enter Gaza after Israeli blockade | ITV News



Plight of the Civilians:



Mounting pressure on Israel:





The UN sent about 90 aid trucks into Gaza on Wednesday — the first delivery since early March. The move comes as global pressure mounts on Israel to ease its blockade and halt the continuous attacks.The first aid delivery came after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was open to a ‘temporary ceasefire’. However, he also said the military would continue its efforts to take full control of Gaza.Three days after Israel announced that it would allow limited aid to Gaza, the United Nations had ""collected around 90 truckloads of goods from the Kerem Shalom crossing and dispatched them into Gaza"", said Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for UN chief Antonio Guterres This development came hours after Israeli troops fired near a group of foreign diplomats visiting the occupied West Bank, which drew strong criticism from around the world.In Gaza, the Hamas government media office reported that 87 aid trucks had arrived. The aid was given to international and local groups to help meet 'urgent humanitarian needs'.Netanyahu said it was necessary to ""avoid a humanitarian crisis in order to preserve our freedom of operational action"" in Gaza.Due to Israel's blockade, Palestinians have been struggling for basic supplies after weeks of near-total isolation resulting in shortage of food and medicine supplies.Meanwhile, Israel had continued with the bombardment of Gaza. On Wednesday, the Gaza's health ministry reported that the bodies of 82 people were taken to hospitals across the territory over the previous 24 hours.Umm Talal al-Masri, 53, a displaced Palestinian in Gaza City, described the situation as ""unbearable"".""No one is distributing anything to us. Everyone is waiting for aid, but we haven't received anything,"" she told AFP.""We barely manage to prepare one meal a day.""Humanitarian groups pointed out that the amount of aid entering Gaza falls far short of what is required to ease the crisis.A US-backed group, Gaza Humanitarian Foundation said it will begin sending aid into Gaza in the coming days. However, the UN and other traditional agencies said they won’t cooperate with the foundation as it is accused of working with Israel.The foundation said it plans to distribute around 300 million meals in its first 90 days.Israel is facing immense pressure, including from traditional allies, to halt its expanded offensive military operations and allow aid into Gaza.On Tuesday, European Union foreign ministers agreed to review the EU’s trade and cooperation deal with Israel. Israel’s foreign ministry said that the EU action ""reflects a total misunderstanding of the complex reality Israel is facing"". Sweden wants the EU to impose sanctions on Israeli ministers, while Britain suspended free-trade talks with Israel and summoned the Israeli ambassador.Pope Leo XIV called the situation in Gaza “worrying and painful” and urged for ""the entry of sufficient humanitarian aid"".Germany asserted the EU-Israel cooperation deal as ""an important forum that we must use in order to discuss critical questions"" over the situation in Gaza.Israel resumed its military operations in Gaza on 18 March, ending a two-month ceasefire. Prime Minister Netanyahu said he is open to a temporary ceasefire if it helps free hostages. He said at least 20 hostages held by Hamas and its allies are still believed to be alive.After Israel resumed military operations in Gaza on 18 March, Gaza’s health ministry reported over 3,509 deaths, taking the war's overall death toll to 53,655, including mostly civilians.In neighbouring Lebanon, authorities stated that Israeli strikes killed three people on Wednesday. Israel said the attacks targeted Hezbollah, a Hamas ally, despite an ongoing ceasefire with the group.","UN sent 90 aid trucks into Gaza on Wednesday. First delivery since early March.

"Senate clears way to block clean air standards in California, including vehicle emission rules",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/senate-clears-way-to-block-clean-air-standards-in-california-including-vehicle-emission-rules/articleshow/121329300.cms,"AP file photo





WASHINGTON: Senate Republicans on Wednesday voted to establish a new precedent that will allow them to roll back vehicle emission standards in California, including a rule phasing out the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035.The winding series of Senate procedural votes that went late into the evening could have profound implications for California's longstanding efforts to reduce air pollution. It also established a new, narrow exception to the Senate filibuster even as Republicans have insisted that they won't try to change Senate rules.Democrats strongly objected to the move, delaying the votes for hours as Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., cleared the way procedurally for Republicans to bring up three House-passed resolutions that would block the rules. The Senate could pass the resolutions later this week.At issue are the three California rules: phasing out gas-powered cars, cutting tailpipe emissions from medium- and heavy-duty vehicles and curbing smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks.Republicans say the phase out of gas-powered cars, along with the other rules, is costly for consumers and manufacturers, puts pressure on the nation's energy grid, and has become a de facto nationwide electric vehicle mandate.Democrats charge that Republicans are acting at the behest of the oil and gas industry and say that California should be able to set its own standards after obtaining waivers from the Environmental Protection Agency.Thune said this week that the waivers ""go far beyond the scope Congress contemplated in the Clean Air Act"" and said they ""endanger consumers, our economy, and our nation's energy supply.""Also at issue is the Senate as an institution, and longstanding filibuster rules that both parties have rolled back over the last two decades. While the Republicans' effort is narrow, it is one of several increasingly partisan efforts to push legislation through the Senate on party-line votes.Through the series of votes on Wednesday, Republicans set precedent for the Senate to reject the state EPA waivers with a simple majority vote. They made that move even after the Senate parliamentarian agreed with the Government Accountability Office that California's policies are not subject to the Congressional Review Act, a law that allows Congress to reject federal regulations under certain circumstances.""Republicans tonight cross a point of no return for the Senate, expanding what this chamber can do at a majority threshold,"" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor as he moved to delay the votes. He called the Republicans ""fair-weather institutionalists.""Both parties have made major moves to roll back the filibuster, which requires a 60-vote threshold, in recent years.Democrats voted in 2013, under President Barack Obama, to lower the vote threshold to a simple majority for all presidential nominees, with the exception of the Supreme Court. In 2017, during President Donald Trump's first term, Republicans rolled back the remaining filibuster rules to confirm Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, a rule that Democrats maintained in confirming Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in 2022. That same year, Democrats unsuccessfully attempted to roll back the legislative filibuster but were thwarted by some in their own party who opposed the move.Republicans have argued this week that they are simply reinforcing Senate rules and federal laws, that are already in place.""We are not talking about doing anything to erode the institutional character of the Senate; in fact, we are talking about preserving the Senate's prerogatives,"" Thune said.The votes to roll back California standards come after years of Republican efforts to block them. The Trump administration in 2019 revoked California's ability to enforce its own emissions standards, but President Joe Biden later restored the state's authority.Republicans have argued that the rules effectively dictate standards for the whole country, imposing what would eventually be a nationwide electric vehicle mandate. Around a dozen states have already followed California's lead.California for decades has been given the authority to adopt vehicle emissions standards that are stricter than the federal government's.

Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, announced plans in 2020 to ban the sale of all new gas-powered vehicles within 15 years as part of an aggressive effort to lower emissions from the transportation sector. Plug-in hybrids and used gas cars could still be sold.The Biden administration approved the state's waiver to implement the standards in December, a month before Trump returned to office. The California rules are stricter than a Biden-era rule that tightens emissions standards but does not require sales of electric vehicles.Biden's EPA said in announcing the decision that opponents of the California waivers did not meet their legal burden to show how either the EV rule or a separate measure on heavy-duty vehicles was inconsistent with the Clean Air Act.Newsom has evoked Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, who signed landmark environmental laws, as he has fought congressional Republicans and the Trump administration on the issue.""The United States Senate has a choice: cede American car-industry dominance to China and clog the lungs of our children, or follow decades of precedent and uphold the clean air policies that Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon fought so hard for,"" he said this week.","Senate Republicans on Wednesday voted to establish a new precedent that will allow them to roll back vehicle emission standards in California. The rules include a rule phasing out the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035. Republicans say the rules effectively dictate standards for the whole country, imposing what would eventually be a nationwide electric vehicle mandate.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121329353,imgsize-1015669,width-400,resizemode-4/121329353.jpg"

A promotion after defeat: What's behind Asim Munir's Field Marshal gambit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/field-marshal-asim-munir-pakistan-army-chief-operation-sindoor-india-and-pakistan/articleshow/121319156.cms,"Asim Munir’s grip on power may look firm, but it’s anything but secure.

Promotion or protection?

Officially, the move is being framed as a recognition of ""strategic brilliance."" PM Sharif praised Munir’s ""decisive defeat of the enemy,"" asserting that under his leadership, the military ""staunchly defended Pakistan’s sovereignty."" Munir himself called the promotion ""an honour for the armed forces and the nation.""

But few outside Pakistan’s tightly controlled media landscape are buying it.

""Field Marshal rank is usually conferred after a military victory,"" Tilak Devasher, a seasoned Pakistan watcher, told the Economic Times. ""This may be the first time it has been awarded after a defeat-it seems intended to mask that defeat.""

The timing is hard to ignore. Pakistan’s public is still reeling from the fallout of the India strikes, and internal dissent within the army is reportedly rising.

A widely circulated letter from a group calling itself ""The Guardians of Honour"" accused Munir of corruption and military incompetence. The letter reflects what some analysts say is quiet but growing discontent within senior ranks.

A shield against scrutiny

All ceremony, no strategy

The big picture: The war at home

Munir’s rise comes at a fragile moment for Pakistan. The ceasefire with India has held for now. But underneath the diplomatic calm lies a volatile domestic landscape:

Security turmoil: Over 3,700 terror incidents have claimed nearly 3,900 lives in the past 17 months, according to ISPR figures-pointing to a deteriorating internal security climate, especially in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Political unrest: The jailing of former PM Imran Khan and suppression of PTI supporters has fueled an undercurrent of defiance. Critics accuse Munir of leveraging the Pahalgam terror incident to consolidate power.

With rising inflation, IMF-dependency, and India's suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, Pakistan's economy teeters on the edge. The military’s growing political role is being scrutinized for exacerbating the instability. Observers note that Munir is not merely defending national borders-he is navigating a labyrinth of domestic vulnerabilities that could unravel his authority.

His use of the two-nation theory and religious rhetoric to frame the India conflict was seen by critics as an attempt to rally the nation behind him. But the strategy may have backfired. ""Instead of unifying the nation, the gambit drew attention to Pakistan’s widening fractures,"" write analysts Ashok Behuria and Uttam Sinha in a joint commentary in the TOI.

The ghost of Imran Khan

What’s next

Munir’s elevation to Field Marshal is not about military strategy-it’s about political survival. It’s about shoring up a fractured command structure, muffling dissent, and projecting strength in the face of growing weakness.

Though the promotion may temporarily strengthen Munir’s position, it doesn’t erase the challenges ahead:

Internal threats persist, from Baloch separatists to the resurgent Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan.

PTI's political comeback looms, with Khan’s moral leverage growing even from prison.

Civil-military tension could intensify, especially if the rank is seen as an attempt to silence dissent or circumvent institutional checks.

There’s also talk of Munir eventually transitioning into a political role-possibly even as president. Ayub Khan set the precedent. In Pakistan’s fragile democracy, few would be surprised if history rhymed again.





In a move steeped more in symbolism than substance, Pakistan’s powerful army chief General Asim Munir has been elevated to the rarefied rank of Field Marshal . The announcement, made on Tuesday by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s cabinet, marks the first such promotion in over six decades. Only one other man-military dictator Ayub Khan in 1959-has held the title.But unlike Ayub, who awarded himself the rank amid consolidating his political power, Munir’s elevation comes on the heels of a military debacle. A bruising exchange with India, following a deadly attack in Pahalgam, resulted in India striking at least nine Pakistani air bases. The damage, while officially downplayed in Pakistan, left Munir politically exposed.So why the promotion? And why now?In a country where generals often enjoy impunity, the Field Marshal title may serve more as legal and political armor than as a mark of distinction. Some analysts see the promotion as a pre-emptive move to insulate Munir from possible court martial or early retirement, the ET report said.Legal experts point out that the Pakistani constitution makes no mention of the rank.Nor does the Pakistan Army Act. Instead, the promotion was reportedly made under Rule 199A of the Army Regulations (1998), which states that a general may be promoted to Field Marshal ""without regard to seniority or any specific appointment.""In essence, the move raises Munir above the military’s existing command structure-and, potentially, above accountability.Though technically ceremonial, the rank carries potent political meaning. In Pakistan’s civil-military power dynamic, optics often matter more than operational command.""Munir is now very much in the driving seat as the pivot of the power structure,"" said Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed, former chair of the Senate defense committee. ""Given the weakness and divisions amongst the civilian politicians... all the mainstream political forces were convinced that the road to Islamabad lies through Rawalpindi.""That reality is reflected in the government’s simultaneous decision to extend the term of air chief marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu-his second extension. Sidhu was credited with executing Operation Bunyanun Marsoos, Pakistan’s retaliatory air campaign against India's Operation Sindoor Still, in a tightly managed information environment, the military’s version of events prevails. State media declared a historic victory. Social media was flooded with hashtags like #PakistanStandsUnited. Meanwhile, dissenting voices-journalists, analysts, even former officers-vanished from screens.Munir’s political calculus also includes a rising challenge from behind bars: Former Prime Minister Imran Khan. His PTI party has labeled Munir a ""warmonger and coward,"" accusing him of dragging Pakistan into war to consolidate power. Khan’s moral authority, paradoxically strengthened by his imprisonment, continues to mobilize his base.Sharif’s civilian government, already seen as beholden to the military, risks further erosion of legitimacy. As one viral meme put it: ""War fought by Airforce. Army Chief promoted. Army’s only contribution-taking videos of tanks and hiding in bunkers.""(With inputs from agencies)","Pakistan's powerful army chief Asim Munir has been elevated to the rank of Field Marshal.

Mongolia: Young Mongolians demand PM resign over corruption claims,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/young-mongolians-demand-pm-resign-over-corruption-claims/articleshow/121329035.cms,"Mongolian Prime Minister Luvsannamsrain Oyun-Erdene (Image credit: https://www.parliament.mn/en/cv/112/)

Counter protests:







Hundreds of young Mongolians turned out this week in the country's capital calling for the prime minister's resignation on allegations of corruption, a longstanding source of deep public anger in the landlocked democracy.Mongolia has for decades struggled with endemic graft and the widespread view that the proceeds of a coal mining boom are being hoarded by a wealthy elite has sparked frequent protests and unrest.Under Prime Minister Luvsannamsrain Oyun-Erdene -- in power since 2021 -- Mongolia has plummeted in Transparency International 's Corruption Perceptions Index.Now fuelling public outrage are allegations that the prime minister's family are enjoying wealth far beyond that expectation of a civil servant on the public dime -- claims sparked by a social media post by his son's girlfriend showing a lavish birthday gift.In a statement to AFP, the prime minister's office said it ""vehemently"" denied allegations of impropriety, describing them as a ""smear"".But hundreds of mostly young protesters have gathered for eight consecutive days at the capital Ulaanbaatar's Sukhbaatar Square, also known as Genghis Khan square, demanding the premier's resignation.""The prime minister has to resign,"" protest organiser O. Ulamsaikhan, 24, told AFP.""What we are trying to achieve is to establish a new political culture in which unethical behaviour by public officials leads to accountability and resignation,"" he said.Also deepening anger in the country are worries over the economy and cost of living. Inflation, which soared following neighbouring Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 -- reached nine percent last year, according to national news agency Montsame.""Young people are working hard to make a living,"" said university freshman O Khulan, 19, who counted among the crowd holding placards declaring ""it's easy to resign"" and ""the natural resources of Mongolia belong to the Mongolians"".""Yet it is unfair that the prime minister's son and his girlfriend have a lavish lifestyle, while I'm buying my bag from a thrift shop,"" she said.""The youth are the future of Mongolia, and we have to stand up for a better one. That's why I wanted to come to the protest and express my opinion,"" she explained.Rejecting the charges, a spokesperson for the prime minister said he is ""on record that everyone must live equally before the law and be able to prove their income"".The spokesperson also pointed to efforts by his government to strengthen anti-corruption efforts and more equitably distribute proceeds from the country's vast natural resources.And counter protesters on the streets of Ulaanbaatar -- overwhelmingly older than their pro-opposition counterparts -- said they supported the prime minister and were sceptical that his resignation would change anything.""While young people are calling for the prime minister's resignation, it raises an important question: 'What then'?"", D Magsarjav, 65, told AFP.""I don't think there is a better candidate for the next prime minister,"" he said.""It is easy to criticise and call for resignation, but much harder to do the job and deliver results,"" 63-year-old D. Oyunchimeg added.But protest organiser Ulamsaikhan vowed to push on with the rallies until Oyun-Erdene steps down.""We will continue our protest until his resignation.""",Mongolia has for decades struggled with endemic graft.

Who is Mohammad Sinwar?







Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in his first press conference since December, has hinted that Israel probably had killed Hamas leader Muhammad Sinwar.Addressing a Jerusalem press conference, Netanyahu claimed that 20 hostages remain alive in Gaza, while ""up to 38"" have perished and assured the public, ""We will bring everyone back. ""Netanyahu stated that Israel maintains a well-structured plan for its military objectives in Gaza, emphasising that the conflict serves a distinct and warranted purpose, Times of Israel reported.""To defeat Hamas, which carried out the atrocities of October 7; to bring back all of our hostages; and to ensure that Gaza does not present a threat to Israel.""He maintained these objectives are interconnected and require complete fulfilment.""We eliminated tens of thousands of terrorists. We eliminated the leaders of the murderers Deif, Haniyeh, Yahya Sinwar and probably Mohammad Sinwar ,"" CNN quoted Netanyahu saying.Regarding potential negotiations, he indicates openness to a ""temporary ceasefire"" if it facilitates the return of additional hostages, whilst emphasising such an arrangement would be time-limited.Mohammed Sinwar, the younger brother of slain Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar, has emerged as a prominent figure in the group's leadership, becoming a key strategist for Hamas during one of its most challenging periods, reports the New York Post.Israel's military campaign over the past 15 months has resulted in the deaths of over 17,000 Hamas members, while Mohammed Sinwar has played a key role in rebuilding the group and reinforcing its control over Gaza, particularly following the death of his brother Yahya last October.'Nicknamed “the shadow” by Israeli officials, Mohammed Sinwar was born in 1975 in a Khan Younis refugee camp and has risen to prominence within Hamas' leadership. Following the death of his brother Yahya Sinwar in October last year, Hamas established a governing council to make it harder for Israel to target its leaders. Mohammed has become the council's key leader, working to rebuild and strengthen the group after its losses.Mohammed’s influence was witnessed during the recent hostage exchange in Gaza City. Hamas fighters in uniforms paraded four Israeli hostages through Palestine Square as supporters cheered and threw confetti. Critics argued that the exchange showed Israel's inability to fully dismantle Hamas despite over a year of continuous conflict, with Sinwar credited for the group's revival.","Mohammed Sinwar is the younger brother of slain Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar.

LIVE: Trump and South Africa President Cyril Ramaphosa hold meeting

Grace under fire

A presidency of performance

Ramaphosa’s balancing act

An office transformed

When South African President Cyril Ramaphosa arrived at the White House this week, he knew it wouldn’t be a warm visit. The US president had already accused his government of enabling a “white genocide.” But nothing could have fully prepared Ramaphosa-or the global audience watching-for what happened next.The lights in the Oval Office dimmed. A television monitor, wheeled in just for the occasion, flickered to life. The screen played a four-minute video showing grainy protest footage, firebrand chants, and white crosses meant to symbolize slain white farmers. The message was clear, if fantastical: South Africa, according to President Trump , was persecuting its white minority-and he had brought his guest here to confront it.“You do allow them to take land, and then when they take the land, they kill the white farmer,” Trump said. “And when they kill the white farmer, nothing happens to them.”It was not a conversation. It was a show.In Donald Trump’s second term, the Oval Office has become less a room for diplomacy and more a studio set. The confrontation with Ramaphosa followed a similar “ambush” earlier this year, when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy walked into what was expected to be a routine alliance-strengthening meeting-and left after a shouting match with Trump and Vice President JD Vance.Now, the template appears set: lights, spectacle, confrontation, and humiliation-preferably televised.“This is literally being watched globally right now,” Trump adviser Jason Miller posted on X, complete with a screenshot of the encounter. “Ratings GOLD.”If the message to the world’s democracies is “play ball or face the glare,” the signal is coming through loud and clear. Cameron Hudson, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, called the Ramaphosa meeting “a circus,” though one that “didn’t go off the cliff.”Former US Ambassador to South Africa Patrick Gaspard was less diplomatic: “Trump turned the meeting with Ramaphosa into a shameful spectacle,” he wrote. “Engaging on Trump’s terms never goes well for anyone.”Trump’s tactics are redefining what a presidential meeting means - turning diplomatic engagements into political theater with real global consequences.1. Diplomacy becomes deterrent: What used to be a coveted invitation for world leaders - the Oval Office - now resembles a stage-managed gauntlet. Trump’s aggressive posture, public confrontations, and nationalist messaging may make foreign leaders wary of future visits, especially those from smaller or non-aligned countries.2. Undermines alliances: Trump’s treatment of allies like Ramaphosa and Zelenskyy undermines US credibility at a time when competition from China and Russia for global influence is intensifying. As one Western diplomat told Reuters, ""This kind of public ambush is something you'd expect from a talk show host, not a US president.""3. Weaponizing the presidency: Trump has effectively turned the Oval Office - historically a symbol of mutual respect and diplomacy - into a live set for reinforcing narratives that energize his political base. Wednesday's display wasn’t about South Africa’s actual crime data or trade. It was about reaffirming Trump’s alignment with white nationalist talking points that resonate with key segments of his support.4. Risks isolating the US: Trump’s readiness to embarrass foreign leaders on live television - especially those from nations the US has strategic interests in - could backfire diplomatically. South Africa, China’s top trading partner on the continent, is being courted by both global powers. Trump’s behavior risks pushing Pretoria further into Beijing’s sphere.The centerpiece of Trump’s presentation was an old, debunked conspiracy theory: that white South African farmers are being hunted and murdered en masse by a Black-majority government. This narrative, popular in far-right internet circles and championed by Trump ally Elon Musk-who was present during the meeting-has long been dismissed by experts.South Africa recorded over 26,000 murders last year, and 44 were linked to farming communities. Just eight of those victims were farmers. The majority of victims, as Ramaphosa calmly explained, are Black. Yet Trump flipped through printed headlines, muttering “death, death, death,” and waved the clippings in front of his guest. One of the images, journalists later confirmed, was actually from the Democratic Republic of Congo.Still, Trump doubled down: “People are fleeing South Africa for their own safety. Their land is being confiscated, and in many cases, they’re being killed.”Ramaphosa tried to interject: “These are concerns we are willing to talk to you about.”But Trump wasn’t interested in dialogue. “The farmers are not Black,” he snapped back.Despite the bait, Ramaphosa remained composed. “If there was Afrikaner farmer genocide, I can bet you these three gentlemen would not be here,” he said, motioning to pro golfers Ernie Els and Retief Goosen, and billionaire Johann Rupert-three white South Africans who had joined his delegation.Observers described the South African president’s performance as tactful, even statesmanlike. “You could see he was being provoked,” said his spokesman, Vincent Magwenya . “He did not fall for the trap.”After the encounter, Ramaphosa tried to reframe the visit. “You wanted to see drama and something big happening,” he told South African reporters. “I’m sorry that we disappointed you somewhat.”Yet for many South Africans, the damage was done. “I don’t understand why Ramaphosa is even in the US,” said a university student in Johannesburg. “Trump has made it very clear how he feels about us.”This was no diplomatic misstep. It was a deliberate performance. “If anybody doubts that the Zelenskyy incident was not completely stage-managed by the White House,” British analyst Tim Marshall said, “the scales should fall from their eyes.”Trump’s new Oval Office doctrine is simple: humiliate to dominate. He’s applied the same strategy to allies and rivals alike. He mocked Canadian PM Mark Carney and suggested Canada should become the 51st US state. He goaded French President Emmanuel Macron on climate and taunted Zelensky over NATO aid. Even Benjamin Netanyahu, one of Trump’s closest allies, was stunned when Trump announced backchannel talks with Iran without warning.The formula is consistent: unpredictability, aggression, and spectacle over substance.The South African president had come to Washington with pragmatic goals. He hoped to lower the temperature on bilateral tensions, reboot stalled trade talks, and repair damage caused by Trump’s earlier decisions to cancel aid, impose tariffs, and recognize Afrikaners as refugees while restricting asylum seekers from other regions.Following the meeting, Ramaphosa tried to salvage the narrative, telling reporters that discussions on liquefied natural gas and critical minerals were “very encouraging.” He even claimed he’d persuaded Trump to consider attending the G20 summit in Johannesburg this November. “I believe we’ve started to change his mind,” he said.But the images of the meeting-of Ramaphosa, politely silent under the harsh glow of Trump’s Oval Office spotlight-will likely overshadow any diplomatic gains.The Oval Office was once a place where history was shaped, where presidents forged treaties and built global alliances. Today, it feels more like a game show set. Gold-plated decor. Televised confrontations. Foreign leaders put on the defensive by a man who treats geopolitics as theater.“We were taught by Nelson Mandela,” Ramaphosa said softly during the meeting, “that whenever there are problems, people need to sit down around the table and talk about them.”In today’s White House, the table has become a stage. The cameras are always rolling. And there’s always a trap.(With inputs from agencies)","US President Donald Trump met with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa this week.

Two women have been arrested for allegedly helping inmates who escaped from the Orleans Justice Center in a daring jailbreak last week, Louisiana State Police said on Wednesday, according to Fox8Live.Courtnie Harris, 32, from New Orleans, and Corvanntay Baptiste, 38, from Slidell, are both accused of acting as accessories after the fact to the escape that took place in the early hours of May 16. The pair were booked into the Plaquemines Parish Detention Centre following their arrests.According to investigators, Harris was in phone contact with one of the five escapees still at large and is accused of driving two of them to several places around New Orleans. Though police did not name the inmate she assisted, a law enforcement source told Fox 8 that Harris was helping Leo Tate.Meanwhile, Baptiste was allegedly supporting escapee Corey Boyd, who was caught on Tuesday night in the 1400 block of Iberville Street. Officials say she kept in touch with Boyd through phone calls and social media, and even brought him food while he was hiding.“Those who choose to assist or conceal these individuals are violating the law and will be held accountable,” Louisiana State Police said in a statement.“Harbouring fugitives threatens the safety of our communities and will not be tolerated.”If convicted, both women face up to five years in a state prison.The breakout has raised serious questions about conditions at the jail. Around 1 am on May 16, ten inmates escaped through a hole behind a toilet. The gap was just wide enough to crawl through. On the wall above it, graffiti taunted staff with messages like “To Easy LOL” and “Catch us when you can”, along with a cartoon face sticking its tongue out.Jail staff only realised the prisoners were missing during an 8:30 a.m. headcount. Surveillance footage later showed the men slipping out a door near a loading dock, scaling a wall, and crossing Interstate 10. They had swapped their orange jumpsuits for civilian clothes to avoid detection.Around five inmates have been recaptured, while five others remain on the run. Authorities have warned that the fugitives may be armed and dangerous, and are urging anyone with information to come forward.","Courtnie Harris, 32, from New Orleans, and Corvanntay Baptiste, 38, from Slidell, are both accused of acting as accessories after the fact to the escape.

Judge says US government didn't follow court order on deportations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/unquestionably-in-violation-judge-says-us-government-didnt-follow-court-order-on-deportations/articleshow/121328050.cms,"AP file photo

The government calls the deported people 'true national security threats'



Lawsuits on immigration issues are everywhere



The countries of origin vary







WASHINGTON: The White House violated a court order on deportations to third countries with a flight linked to the chaotic African nation of South Sudan , a federal judge said Wednesday, hours after the Trump administration said it had expelled eight immigrants convicted of violent crimes but refused to reveal where they would end up. The judge's statement was a notably strong rebuke to the government's deportation efforts.In an emergency hearing he called to address reports that immigrants had been sent to South Sudan , Judge Brian E. Murphy in Boston said the eight migrants aboard the plane were not given a meaningful opportunity to object that the deportation could put them in danger. Minutes before the hearing, administration officials accused ""activist judges"" of advocating the release of dangerous criminals.""The department actions in this case are unquestionably in violation of this court's order,"" Murphy said Wednesday, arguing that the deportees didn't have a ""meaningful opportunity"" to object to being sent to South Sudan. The group was flown out of the United States just hours after getting notice, leaving them no chance to contact lawyers who could object in court.Government attorneys argued that the men had a history with the immigration system, giving them prior opportunities to express a fear of being deported to a country outside their homeland. They also pointed out that the judge had not specified the exact time needed between notice and deportation, leaving room for misunderstanding.The migrants' home countries - Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, Vietnam and South Sudan - would not take them back, according to Todd Lyons, the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, who spoke to reporters in Washington.He later said the migrants either came from countries that often do not take back all their deported citizens or had other situations that meant they could not be sent home.""These represent the true national security threats,"" Lyons said at a news conference. Behind him was a display of photos of men he said had been convicted of rape, homicide, armed robbery and other crimes.Administration officials, who have repeatedly clashed with the courts over their attempts to deport large numbers of immigrants, made their displeasure clear Wednesday.President Donald Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ""are working every single day to get these vicious criminals off of American streets - and while activist judges are on the other side, fighting to get them back onto the United States soil,"" said Tricia McLaughlin, a department spokesperson. She pointed to the photographs and described them as ""the monsters"" that Murphy ""is trying to protect.""Homeland Security officials released few specific details about the deportation flight. They said it left Tuesday with eight people on board and said they remained in the department's custody Wednesday. Officials said they could not disclose the migrants' final destination because of ""safety and operational security.""The case comes amid a sweeping immigration crackdown by the Republican administration, which has pledged to deport millions of people who are living in the United States illegally. The legal fight is the latest flashpoint as the administration rails against judges whose rulings have slowed the president's policies.With Congress largely silent or supportive, opponents of Trump's agenda have filed hundreds of lawsuits, and judges have issued dozens of orders against the administration. Immigration has been the most contentious issue. There was the mistaken deportation of an immigrant who was living in Maryland to a prison in El Salvador, as well as Trump's push to swiftly deport alleged Venezuelan gang members without a court review.The administration officials insisted that the deported men had received due process, but did not provide details. Immigration-rights attorneys argue they violated Murphy's order, first handed down in March, that says people must have a chance to argue that going somewhere outside their homeland would put them in danger before being deported, even if they've otherwise exhausted their legal appeals.""The government is still refusing to provide due process to our clients, which means they are not giving them notice of the country to which they're being deported, proper notice in a language that they understand, and not giving them a meaningful opportunity to claim fear based on those countries,"" Trina Realmuto, the executive director of the National Immigration Litigation Alliance, said outside court.""These are countries that the State Department doesn't want Americans to travel to. They are categorically not safe,"" she added.In court, Realmuto asked the judge to return the individuals to the United States. ""They are no less deserving of protection than any other human beings on this planet,"" she said.The government argued that the interviews with the men over their fears could be done where they are currently being held and confirmed with Murphy that they can be arranged. Realmuto called this a ""logistical nightmare"" that penalizes the men because the government violated the judge's order. She said it would prove a challenge to get the men legal counsel and interpreters, an effort complicated by the time difference.Murphy, who raised the prospect of criminal contempt for anyone ""involved in an illegal deportation,"" later Wednesday ordered the government to conduct a new set of interviews with the migrants if an appropriate place with appropriate privacy can be found. He said the government was welcome to bring the migrants back, but did not order them to do so.On Twitter late Wednesday, DHS's McLaughlin called the order ""deranged.""Attorneys for the immigrants told the judge that immigration authorities may have sent as many as a dozen people from several countries to Africa.The apparent removal of one man from the troubled Southeast Asian nation of Myanmar was confirmed in an email from an immigration official in Texas, according to court documents. He was informed only in English, a language he does not speak well, and his lawyers learned of the plan hours before his deportation flight, they said.A woman also reported that her husband, from Vietnam and up to 10 other people were flown to Africa on Tuesday morning, attorneys from the National Immigration Litigation Alliance wrote.Murphy, who was nominated by Democratic President Joe Biden, previously found that any plans to deport people to Libya without notice would ""clearly"" violate his ruling.South Sudan says it's unaware of any arrivals South Sudan's police spokesperson, Maj. Gen. James Monday Enoka, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that no migrants had arrived in the country and that if they do, they would be investigated and ""redeported to their correct country"" if found not to be South Sudanese.Edmund Yakani, executive director of the South Sudanese group Community Empowerment for Progress Organization, questioned why people convicted of crimes in the United States would be sent there. ""Is South Sudan a land of fewer humans who deserve to receive perpetrators of human rights violations? Without any public explanation?"" he asked.Some countries do not accept deportations from the United States. That has led the administration to strike agreements with other countries, including Panama, to house them. The US has sent Venezuelans to a notorious prison in El Salvador under an 18th-century wartime law, an action being contested in the courts.South Sudan has endured repeated waves of violence since gaining independence from Sudan in 2011 amid hopes it could use its large oil reserves to bring prosperity to a region long battered by poverty. Just weeks ago, the country's top UN official warned that fighting between forces loyal to the president and a vice president threatened to spiral again into full-scale civil war.The State Department's annual report on South Sudan, published in April 2024, says ""significant human rights issues"" include arbitrary killings, disappearances, torture or inhumane treatment by security forces and extensive violence based on gender and sexual identity.The Homeland Security Department has given Temporary Protected Status to a small number of South Sudanese already living in the United States, shielding them from deportation because conditions were deemed unsafe for return. Noem recently extended those protections to November to allow for a more thorough review.The US is one of the biggest donors to South Sudan's humanitarian aid programs, with the total funding in 2024 standing at over $640 million.","Judge says deportees didn't have a ""meaningful opportunity"" to object to being sent to South Sudan.

Donald Trump slams NBC reporter over Qatar jet question,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/youre-a-disgrace-trump-slams-nbc-reporter-over-qatar-jet-question/articleshow/121327506.cms,"US Donald Trump (File Image)





US President Donald Trump lashed out at NBC reporter , calling him ""disgrace"" and ""jerk"" on Wednesday after he asked about accepting a luxurious Qatari jet and modifying it as a future Air Force One Fuming over the question, Trump said that the reporter Peter Alexander is a disgrace and directed him not to ask any more questions.Trump, while having a tense meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa at the White House, accused the reporter of diverting attention from more pressing issues, such as the violence and racist laws against white farmers in South Africa.""You get out of here. What does this have to do with the Qatari jet? They're giving the United States Air Force a jet. Okay. And it's a great thing. We're talking about a lot of other things. It's NBC trying to get off the subject of what you just saw. You are a real. You know, you're a terrible reporter, number one. You don't have what it takes to be a reporter. Not smart enough. But for you to go onto a subject about a jet that was given to the United States Air Force, which is a very nice thing, they also gave $5.1 trillion worth of investment in addition to the jet,"" Trump said.""Go back. You ought to go back to your studio at NBC because Brian Roberts and the people that run that place, they ought to be investigated.They are so terrible the way you run that network. And you're a disgrace. No more questions from you. Go. Go ahead. Talk about that. His name is Peter something. He's a terrible reporter. Quiet, quiet, quiet. Let's go,"" he added.Despite Trump's warning over the question, Alexander persisted in questioning the president. ""Why extend a White House invitation to [Ramaphosa] if genocide is occurring?"" he inquired.""Quiet, quiet,"" responded the president, before acknowledging another journalist.The Qatar aircraft question continued to irritate Trump later, following responses from both leaders regarding allegations of genocide in South Africa.“If the news wasn’t fake, like NBC, which is fake news, one of the worst like ABC, NBC, CBS, if they weren’t fake news like this jerk that we have here,” the president said, pointing to Alexander, “If we had real reporters, they’d be covering it.”""White farmers are being killed and buried, yet his concern is about an aircraft donation. You should feel disgrace. Your reporting is absolutely dreadful,"" Trump stated.“‘So why did they give us a plane to the United States Air Force?’” he continued, mocking Alexander once again. “That’s what that idiot talks about after viewing a thing where thousands of people are dead.”Ramaphosa attempted to lighten the atmosphere by offering a humorous apology for arriving without an aircraft gift.""I regret not bringing a plane for you,"" the South African leader remarked.""I wish you had,"" Trump replied. ""Should your nation offer an aircraft to the United States Air Force, I would accept it.""","US President Donald Trump lashed out at NBC reporter Peter Alexander after he asked about accepting a luxurious Qatari jet and modifying it as a future Air Force One.

'Into the mouth of Trump hell': South African President Ramaphosa calls meeting with Donald Trump 'good',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/into-the-mouth-of-trump-hell-south-african-president-ramaphosa-calls-meeting-with-donald-trump-good/articleshow/121327333.cms,"South Africa President Cyril Ramaphosa with US counterpart Donald Trump (AP Photo)





The atmosphere in South Africa was tense ahead of President Cyril Ramaphosa 's meeting with US counterpart Donald Trump , worrying that its leader might face public humiliation similar to what Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy experienced. Even a local newspaper captured the mood with the headline ""Into the mouth of Trump hell"".Despite Trump presenting unfounded claims about widespread killings of white farmers and showing a video of a marginal South African politician's inflammatory chants, Ramaphosa maintained his composure. The meeting proved less contentious than anticipated.""You wanted to see drama and something big happening,"" Ramaphosa told reporters afterwards. ""I'm sorry that we disappointed you somewhat.""In South Africa, Ramaphosa is known for his composed demeanour and level-headed approach to politics. His significant political achievement includes serving as the African National Congress party's primary negotiator during the early 1990s talks that dismantled apartheid's racial segregation system.Although initially considered a potential successor to Nelson Mandela, he stepped away from politics before returning and assuming the presidency in 2018.The meeting's purpose was to address US misrepresentations of South Africa and establish new trade agreements . However, many South Africans opposed the visit, given the U.S. administration's serious false allegations about their nation.""I honestly don't understand why Ramaphosa is actually in the United States when Trump has made it very clear how he feels about South Africa,"" said college student Dumisani Mnisi in Johannesburg.Ramaphosa's office described the public confrontation as “an orchestrated show for the cameras,” and the real business was the closed-door meeting afterwards, suggesting the subsequent private meeting was more productive. The South African president cited several positive outcomes, including potential progress in changing Trump's perspective on South Africa and initiating trade discussions.The visit concluded with an exchange of books and White House souvenirs, which Ramaphosa viewed positively, stating, ""So that was good.""","South African President Cyril Ramaphosa met with US counterpart Donald Trump.

Institute of Peace reclaims its headquarters after court win over Musk's cost-cutting team,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/institute-of-peace-reclaims-its-headquarters-after-court-win-over-musks-cost-cutting-team/articleshow/121327440.cms,"The headquarters are located in Washington DC, US (Image: AP)





The US Institute of Peace retook control of its headquarters Wednesday, two days after a federal judge said the firing of its board and employees by Elon Musk 's Department of Government Efficiency was illegal.The institute's acting president, George Moose , entered the organization's headquarters with private security and the institute's outside attorney for the first time since being escorted off the premises during the DOGE takeover. Moose and most of the institute's board were fired in March, part of the mass slashing of the federal workforce spearheaded by Musk.The institute and many of its board members filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration soon after, seeking to prevent their removal and stop DOGE from taking over its operations. US District Court Judge Beryl A Howell's opinion on Monday reversed DOGE's actions.Speaking after a short examination of the headquarters, Moose said all appeared to be in order.""We just did a quick walk-through - externally, visibly, things look to be in pretty good shape,"" he said. ""I didn't see anything, any destruction, if you will, no damage that I can see that is visible.""Moose, a former ambassador and career member of the US Foreign Service, said a team of employees from human resources, technology and finance would be in the building Thursday getting the nonprofit ready to welcome back its workforce.He expected to bring back all the staff who want to return.In an email Wednesday, White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly did not comment on workers returning to the building, but signaled that the administration may challenge the decision.""President Trump is right to reduce failed, useless entities like USIP to their statutory minimum, and the rogue judge's attempt to impede on the separation of powers will not be the last say on the matter,"" she said.The administration filed a motion of appeal Wednesday evening and requested a stay of the judge's ruling while that appeal is considered, arguing in part that Howell ""erred"" in concluding that the institution's functions were not executive functions.Agencies across the federal government have been slashed or dismantled by Musk's DOGE team. Wednesday's low-key scene at the institute's headquarters marked a rare moment when a DOGE-targeted agency or organization has been able to begin reestablishing itself.The judge's ruling said the Trump administration did not have authority to unilaterally dismantle the institute, which was established by Congress in 1984 as an independent organization that would promote peace and seek to end conflicts around the world. It was operating in more than two dozen conflict zones at the time Musk's team took it over and shut it down.The saga began when Trump issued an executive order in February that targeted the institute and three other agencies for closure in an effort to deliver on campaign promises to shrink the size of the government. The first attempt by DOGE to take over the headquarters led to a standoff. Members of Musk's DOGE group returned days later with the FBI and District of Columbia Metropolitan Police to help them gain entry.DOGE installed new leadership, ordered a mass firing of nearly all the staff through their private emails, and handed over the institute's headquarters to the General Services Administration.The institute, concerned about liability and security of the building in the aftermath of the judge's ruling, reached out to the government attorneys earlier this week and again on Wednesday. George Foote, the institute's outside attorney, said the exchange was very smooth and orderly.Moose said the goal now is to get back to the work the institute was created to do 40 years ago and ""projects, ideas that are, we believe, of interest to the American people.""","The US Institute of Peace retook control of its headquarters Wednesday, two days after a federal judge said the firing of its board and employees by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency was illegal.

New Orleans Jailbreak: Lawyer says maintenance worker was 'not aware' of New Orleans jail inmates' plan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/they-used-him-as-a-tool-lawyer-says-maintenance-worker-was-not-aware-of-inmates-plan-to-escape-from-new-orleans-prison/articleshow/121327202.cms,"Maintenance worker Sterling Williams

Inmates used Williams as a ‘tool’ to escape, lawyer says

‘A scapegoat’





The lawyer of Sterling Williams , a maintenance worker charged with and arrested for allegedly helping 10 inmates escape a New Orleans prison facility, on Wednesday countered the official version that Williams ""wilfully and maliciously"" assisted the group.The worker had ""no idea"" about the men's plan and was not involved when they cut a pipe behind the toilet to create an opening for their escape, his attorney Michael Kennedy told news agency AP.According to authorities, one of the inmates had instructed the 33-year-old to turn off the water to a toilet, leading to one of the largest jailbreaks in the recent US history.While five have been re-captured , the others are still on the run.As per Kennedy, the attorney, Williams found a toilet overflowing after being called by a deputy to check it.“This was clearly all part of an orchestrated plan. Sterling was nothing more than the tool the men used to turn off the water, which they knew would have to happen after clogging the toilet,” he said.An arrest affidavit which made no mention of a clogged toilet, stated that Williams was “initially very evasive and untruthful” during an interview but ultimately told investigators an inmate had threatened to “shank” (stab) him if he did not turn off the water.Williams could have reported the threat and the escape plan, authorities say. They asserted that because the water was turned off, the group was “able to successfully make good” on their plan, the affidavit mentioned.On this, Kennedy stated that Williams did not report the escape because the latter was “not aware” it was happening. The lawyer also addressed authorities’ statements that his client was ""threatened"" into helping the escape.“He was not aware that there was going to be an escape. He was not conspiring with them. He had no knowledge that he was being used.”Kennedy further claimed he was only able to meet with Williams for around 30 minutes via Zoom.“The most important thing I’ve learned is that these charges are ridiculous and the sheriff’s office is trying to use him as a scapegoat to minimize their own embarrassment. Sterling did nothing more than the job they pay him to do and now they’re attempting to sacrifice him for it,” he alleged.The maintenance worker is charged with 10 counts of principal to simple escape and one count of malfeasance in office.","Sterling Williams, 33, is accused of helping 10 inmates escape from a New Orleans prison.
