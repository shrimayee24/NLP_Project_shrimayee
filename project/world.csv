"14 killed, 70 hurt as mega hoarding falls on Mumbai pump in dust storm",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/14-killed-70-hurt-as-mega-hoarding-falls-on-mum-pump-in-dust-storm/articleshow/110099107.cms,"MUMBAI:

At least 14 people were killed and close to 70 others injured after a 250-tonne illegal advertisement hoarding crashed on a petrol pump at Mumbai’s Ghatkopar after a sudden dust storm and rain coupled with winds of up to 60kmph — which IMD said were just pre-monsoon activity — crippled life across the city on Monday evening.At the time of going to press, officials claimed that more people were trapped under the hoarding and were being rescued.There were about 150 vehicles at the petrol pump at the time of the crash, including bikes that had sought shelter from the sudden rain.Zonal DCP Purushottam Karad said a case has been registered for culpable homicide not amounting to murder and causing grievous hurt, among other sections of the IPC. Sources said Bhavesh Bhinde, director of advertising agency Ego Media Pvt Ltd, which had erected the hoarding, is among those who have been booked.A 23-year-old man and two men in their 40s were among the Ghatkopar crash victims. Most survivors had blunt trauma, and fractures in the arm, shoulder and back, said chief medical officer Bharati Rajulwala of Rajawadi Hospital. She said those requiring surgery would be moved to Sion and KEM hospitals.The weather and the accidents left destruction in their wake elsewhere too: there were stampede-like situations at Dadar and Wadala stations, Harbour and Western Railway services were delayed, leading to massive traffic bottlenecks; tree collapses were reported; 15 Mumbai-bound flights were diverted, and there were intermittent power cuts and disruption in water supply in several parts of the city. The mayhem also caused political disruptions, with campaign rallies and roadshows for LS polls either cancelled or truncated.(Inputs from Swati Deshpande, Sanjeev Devasia, Manthan Mehta, Sumitra Deb Roy, Nitasha Natu, Clara Lewis & Mateen Hafeez)","A 250-tonne illegal advertisement hoarding crashed on a petrol pump at Mumbai’s Ghatkopar.

"Villagers allege Bijapur encounter fake, victims were collecting tendu",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/villagers-allege-bijapur-encounter-fake-victims-were-collecting-tendu/articleshow/110094626.cms,"RAIPUR: Two days after security forces claimed to have killed 12 Maoists in an encounter in Bastar’s Bijapur, local villagers, mostly women, marched to district headquarters accusing police of a fake encounter . Innocent villagers were gunned down while collecting tendu leaves , they claimed.DIG (South Bastar) Kamalochan Kashyap said those killed were Maoists, many of whom carried bounties.CM Vishnu Deo Sai praised police for their action against Maoists. “Just two days ago, 12 Maoists were killed in an encounter,” CM said on Sunday.In Bijapur, the protest is gaining momentum. Tribal rights activists plan to visit Pidiya village, around 40km from Bijapur and 470km south of Raipur, on a fact-finding mission and Maoists have issued a statement alleging that innocent villagers were killed in police action.Protesters from Pidiya village in Bijapur’s Gangaloor region, where the alleged encounter occurred, began arriving at the district headquarters on Saturday. They are now camping there, seeking justice for the ‘fake encounter’. Women protesters claimed that security forces shot residents from Pidiya and neighbouring Itawar village when they were gathering tendu leaves, a crucial livelihood activity in the area. One of the agitators, Avlam Budri, said police arrested her husband during tendu leaf collection on Friday.Tribal activist Soni Sori, who accompanied them, told reporters in Bijapur that Friday’s police encounter was fake and security personnel had “fired indiscriminately at tendu collectors”. Rakesh Avlam, who identified himself as a Pidiya resident, alleged that one of his cousins was injured in police action.Former Congress CM Bhupesh Baghel posted on X that security forces should “keep in mind that their ultimate commitment is to the Constitution. Political pressure on security forces to achieve results should not lead to questioning their actions. There is a need to solve the naxalite problem while maintaining the morale of security forces.”Maoists’ West Bastar division committee described the Bijapur encounter as fake and urged people to “condemn the massacre”. Maoists alleged that 1,200 security personnel fired indiscriminately at tendu collectors, even shooting a two-inch mortar cell and a rocket launcher at them. Several innocent villagers were injured and should receive medical care, Maoists said, demanding action against the forces, release of the detained villagers, and a judicial probe.Security forces have been on the offensive ever since BJP govt took over in Dec last year. The CM said 104 naxalites have been eliminated this year in encounters with security forces, including 12 in Pidiya.","Security forces claimed to have killed 12 Maoists in an encounter in Bastar’s Bijapur.

""Sometimes when we listen closely to Israeli leaders, they talk about mostly the idea of....a sweeping victory on the battlefield, total victory,"" he said.""I don't think we believe that that is likely or possible and that this looks a lot like situations that we found ourselves in after 9/11, where, after civilian populations had been moved and lots of violence that...the insurrections continue.""Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly vowed to achieve ""total victory"" against Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that attacked Israel on October 7 and killed 1,200 people and took 250 others hostage.In response, Israel unleashed a relentless assault on the Gaza Strip, killing more than 35,000 people, according to the figures of the Gazan health ministry, and reducing the densely populated tiny enclave to a wasteland.Campbell's comments come as Washington is warning Israel not to go ahead with a major military offensive in Rafah, the southernmost city of the Gaza Strip where over a million people who have already been displaced by Israeli attacks are taking shelter.Likening the situation in Gaza to that of a recurring insurgency that the United States faced in Afghanistan and Iraq after its invasions there following the September 11 attacks, Campbell said a political solution was required.""I think we view that there has to be more of a political solution...What's different from the past in that sense, many countries want to move towards a political solution in which the rights of Palestinians are more respected,"" he said.""I don't think it's ever been more difficult than right now,"" he added.","US deputy secretary of state Kurt Campbell says Israel's current military strategy won't bring the result that it is aiming for.

Rafah Bombardments Intensifying: Israel's incursion into Gaza sparks condemnation and humanitarian concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israels-incursion-into-gaza-sparks-condemnation-and-humanitarian-concerns/articleshow/110090358.cms,"CAIRO: Israeli forces pushed deep into the ruins of Gaza 's northern edge to recapture an area where they claimed to have dismantled Hamas months ago, while in the south- tanks and troops pushed across a highway into Rafah.Some of the most intense fighting for weeks is raging in both the north and south. Israeli operations in Rafah, which borders Egypt, have closed a main crossing point for aid, which humanitarian groups say is worsening an already dire situation.Hundreds of thousands of people are being forced to flee again after around half of Gaza's population took sanctuary there after being pushed south by fighting elsewhere.Gaza's health authority appealed for international pressure to reopen access via the southern border to allow in aid and medical supplies.""The wounded and sick suffer a slow death because there is no treatment and supplies and they cannot travel,"" it said.In northern Gaza's Jabalia, a sprawling refugee camp built 75 years ago to house Palestinian refugees from what is now Israel , tanks pushed towards the heart of the district. Residents fled along rubble-strewn streets carrying bags of belongings. Tank shells landed in the centre of the camp and airstrikes destroyed clusters of houses, they said. Health officials said they had recovered 20 bodies of Palestinians killed in overnight airstrikes.""We don't know where to go. We have been displaced from one place to the next... We are running in the streets. I saw it with my own eyes. I saw the tank and the bulldozer. It is on that street,"" said one woman, who did not give her name.Israel's military said in early January that it had ""dismantled Hamas' military framework in Jabalia"", although it expected to return to the area periodically to fight militants.Palestinians say the need to return to earlier battlegrounds is proof Israel's military objectives are unattainable.Israeli troops are seeking to wipe out Hamas, which has said it is committed to Israel's destruction. The militant group burst into Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 and taking more than 250 hostages, by Israeli tallies.Attending a Memorial Day ceremony to mark Israel's fallen soldiers in Jerusalem on Monday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the war against Hamas is a struggle to secure Israel's ""existence, liberty, security and prosperity.""""Our war of independence is not over yet, it continues to these days,"" he said.The Palestinian death toll in the war has now surpassed 35,000, with 57 killed in the past 24 hours, according to Gaza health officials, whose figures do not differentiate between civilians and fighters.In Rafah, Israel stepped up aerial and ground bombardments on the eastern areas of the city, killing people in an airstrike on a house in the Brazil neighbourhood.Israel ordered residents out of the east of Rafah last week, and extended that order to central areas in recent days, sending hundreds of thousands of people fleeing in search of safety. UNRWA , the main United Nations aid agency in Gaza, estimated that about 360,000 people had fled the southern city since the Israeli military gave its first evacuation order a week ago.In Gaza city, Al-Ahli Arab Hospital medics said five people were killed in an airstrike on a house.The assault on Rafah has caused one of the biggest splits in decades between Israel and its main ally the United States, which paused some deliveries of weapons for the first time since the war began. Washington says Israel must not assault Rafah without a plan to protect civilians, which it has yet to see.Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant's office said that he had briefed US secretary of state Antony Blinken on the ""precise operation"" in the Rafah area.Hamas' armed wing said its fighters were engaged in gun battles with Israeli forces in one of the streets east of Rafah, and in the east of Jabalia.In Israel, the military sounded sirens several times in areas near Gaza, warning of potential Palestinian cross-border rocket and or mortar launches.Hamas and the armed wing of Islamic Jihad said in a joint statement that they fired mortar bombs against Israeli forces massing inside the Rafah crossing, which Israel captured last week.","Israeli forces push deep into the ruins of Gaza's northern edge to recapture an area where they claimed to have dismantled Hamas months ago.

Its shared Orthodox heritage, mutual distrust of Nato , and military alliances throughout several wars have strengthened their ties.Since early 2022, Serbia has welcomed tens of thousands of Russians fleeing to avoid being sent to the front.

It has simultaneously sought to join the European Union, welcomed Chinese investment, and remained on largely friendly terms with the Kremlin.It has been reliant for years on support from both Russia and China to prevent the UN from recognizing Kosovo as independent, following its secession from Serbia in 2008.Ukraine has never recognized Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence either.Russia on Monday pummelled more than 30 towns and villages in Ukraine's northeastern Kharkiv region after launching a surprise ground offensive over the border last week.","Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba began an official visit to Serbia on Monday.

A report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) indicates that between 2019 and 2023, China accounted for 82% of Pakistan’s arms imports, reflecting a deepening military relationship between the two nations.""China is strongly contributing to the strengthening of Pakistan’s military by providing fighter jets, warships, missile technology, drones, etc.This is part of China’s strategy to counter the influence and power of Quad-4 (that includes India) and the West’s other regional alliances,"" an opinion piece in the EurAsian Times said.During President Xi Jinping’s 2015 visit to Pakistan, a significant agreement was forged for China to construct eight Hangor-class submarines for Pakistan, enhancing its naval power. ""The submarines will play a pivotal role in maintaining peace and stability in the region. It would add a new dimension to the ever-tested Pakistan-China friendship,” said Admiral Naveed Ashraf, Pakistani Chief of Naval Staff. This deal is part of China's broader strategy to counterbalance the influence of the Quad alliance and Western powers in the region.Amidst this backdrop of military enhancement, Pakistan grapples with an acute economic crisis , exacerbated by last year's devastating floods which led to a severe reduction in the GDP growth projection from 5% to 0.29%. The financial strain is further highlighted by a comment from the Business Standard, noting, ""Pakistan has no food for its people but purchases weapons."" The national budget reflects a 15.4% increase in defense spending, totaling 1804 billion rupees, even as the nation contends with skyrocketing inflation and widespread poverty.The economic hardships have led to public discontent, with Pakistani media reporting severe shortages of basic necessities such as food and medicines. Many believe that the real power in Pakistan lies with the military, which commands a significant portion of the national budget and operates vast revenue-generating enterprises. This perception is reinforced by international discussions, such as those held by the IMF, which highlight the disproportionate allocation of resources to the military at the expense of civil needs, the EurAsian Times report said.Adding to the controversy, recent reports from the BBC and other media outlets have suggested that despite Pakistan’s official stance of neutrality in the Ukraine conflict, there have been covert operations involving the supply of arms to Ukraine. These reports allege that under American pressure, Pakistan engaged in secret deals that not only violated its declared neutrality but also provided substantial profits from arms sales.","Pakistan is persistently expanding its military capabilities, notably through substantial arms imports and collaborations with China.

Russian President Putin removes defense minister Sergei Shoigu,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/russian-president-putin-removes-defense-minister-sergei-shoigu/articleshow/110061169.cms,"NEW DELHI: Russian President Vladimir Putin has replaced Sergei Shoigu as defense minister , in a significant Cabinet shakeup coinciding with the start of his fifth term. The move comes as part of a broader restructuring following Putin's recent inauguration.Following protocol, the entire Russian Cabinet resigned post-inauguration, with most ministers expected to retain their positions.However, Shoigu's future had been uncertain until Putin announced his new role as secretary of Russia 's Security Council. Shortly thereafter, Putin proposed Andrei Belousov as Shoigu's successor.Belousov's nomination requires approval from Russia's upper house of parliament, the Federation Council. Alongside this change, other ministerial appointments were proposed by Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, who was reappointed by Putin.The decision to replace Shoigu, who held the defense minister post since 2012, follows the arrest of his deputy, Timur Ivanov, on bribery charges. This move raised speculation about Shoigu's position, despite his close ties to Putin.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stated that Putin's choice of a civilian for the defense minister role aims to inject innovation and economic efficiency into the defense sector. Belousov, formerly the first deputy prime minister, is seen as fitting this vision due to his extensive experience in finance and economics.Shoigu's shift to the Security Council underscores Putin's strategy of retaining key figures in advisory roles. This tactic aligns with previous appointments, including formerPresident Dmitry Medvedev, who serves as the council's deputy chairman.The reshuffle comes amid ongoing tensions with Ukraine. Recent clashes have resulted in casualties and civilian displacement, with Russian forces making territorial gains in Ukraine's northeast. Analysts suggest Russia's strategy involves exploiting ammunition shortages and intensifying battles to exhaust Ukrainian forces.The situation remains volatile, with reports of a residential building collapse in Belgorod, attributed to Ukrainian shelling. While Russia claims territorial gains, Ukrainian officials have not confirmed these reports, emphasizing the fluidity and complexity of the conflict.Putin's restructuring of key positions reflects his broader agenda for governance and security. As geopolitical tensions persist, the implications of these changes reverberate both domestically and internationally, shaping the trajectory of Russian policy and its regional relations.(With inputs from agencies)",Russian President Vladimir Putin has replaced Sergei Shoigu as defense minister.

NEW DELHI: One police officer was killed and over 100 individuals, primarily law enforcement personnel, sustained injuries during intense confrontations between security forces and demonstrators protesting against the elevated costs of wheat flour and electricity in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir , according to media reports on Sunday. The disputed territory experienced clashes on Saturday between the police and activists of a rights movement, coinciding with a wheel-jam and shutter-down strike across the region, as reported by the Dawn newspaper.Mirpur Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Kamran Ali informed Dawn.com that sub-inspector Adnan Qureshi succumbed to a gunshot wound in the chest while deployed with other police personnel in the town of Islamgarh to prevent a rally headed towards Muzaffarabad via Kotli and Poonch districts, organized by the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC).In the days leading up to the planned long march towards Muzaffarabad on Saturday, around 70 JAAC activists were arrested by police during raids at their residences and those of their relatives in Muzaffarabad and Mirpur divisions, sparking serious clashes in Dadyal on Thursday. The committee subsequently called for a shutter-down and wheel-jam strike on Friday.Amidst a crippling strike on Friday, violent clashes erupted between police and protesters in various areas of Muzaffarabad, the capital of PoK. On Saturday, authorities placed mounds of earth on arteries leading to Muzaffarabad and made additional arrests to prevent people from reaching the state capital.SSP Yasin Baig stated that at least one police officer and a young boy were injured as police resorted to teargas shelling and aerial firing in some neighborhoods after protesters pelted stones and bottles. Kotli SSP Mir Muhammad Abid reported that at least 78 policemen were injured in the district during ""attacks of miscreants under the guise of protest .""According to a press release from the District Headquarters Hospital Kotli, apart from the 59 wounded policemen, nine injured protesters were also brought in for treatment.

Heavy fighting has been reported in the border area, prompting the evacuation of 1,775 individuals. Tragically, two men were killed and two others wounded by guided aerial bomb attacks in the town of Vovchansk.Despite assurances from Kharkiv regional governor Oleg Synegubov that there is currently no imminent ground operation threat to the city of Kharkiv, residents from border areas have fled in fear. Evacuees, many of whom are elderly, have sought refuge at reception centers near Kharkiv, receiving essential assistance.The situation remains precarious, with aid workers highlighting the challenges of evacuating residents amid ongoing troop movements and heightened danger. Zelenskyy reiterated the urgent need for international support, stressing the importance of timely arms deliveries to bolster Ukrainian defenses.Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces have intensified attacks inside Russia and Russia-held territories, targeting energy infrastructure. In a retaliatory strike, a missile hit a restaurant in the Russian-held city of Donetsk, claiming three lives and injuring several others.Analysts speculate that Russia's ground operation aims to establish a buffer zone near its Belgorod region or divert Ukrainian resources from the Donetsk region.

At least 18 others are injured. We are also still searching for 16 other people,"" West Sumatra disaster agency spokesman Ilham Wahab told AFP.The rescue operation, comprising local responders, law enforcement, military personnel, and volunteers, is tirelessly ongoing.The flash floods and cold lava flow hit Agam and Tanah Datar districts around 10:30 pm (1530 GMT) on Saturday, as reported by Basarnas search and rescue agency. Cold lava, or lahar, composed of volcanic ash, sand, and stones, descended the slopes of Mount Marapi due to the heavy rain.Earlier reports from Basarnas had accounted for 12 fatalities, including children. Ilham mentioned that reports of missing individuals are continuously coming in from concerned relatives.Damage assessment reveals mosques, residences, and public infrastructure wrecked by the disaster. In Tanah Datar, a tourist hotspot named Lembah Anai witnessed severe road damage, cutting off access between Padang and Bukittinggi. Meanwhile, in Agam, numerous homes and facilities suffered destruction.Authorities have mobilized rescue teams and boats to locate missing persons and facilitate evacuations to shelters. Evacuation centers and emergency posts have been established across Agam and Tanah Datar districts.Indonesia's susceptibility to landslides and floods during the rainy season is well-known. In March, West Sumatra faced a similar tragedy, claiming at least 26 lives. Additionally, environmentalists attribute deforestation, primarily due to logging, as a significant exacerbating factor in such disasters, emphasizing the protective role of trees against flooding.Mount Marapi's recent eruption in December resulted in a towering ash column reaching 3,000 meters (9,800 feet) into the sky.

'They can't afford to lose': US Senator suggests Israel should be allowed to nuke Gaza,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/they-cant-afford-to-lose-us-senator-suggests-israel-should-be-allowed-to-nuke-gaza/articleshow/110100973.cms,"NEW DELHI: Republican senator

Lindsey Graham

drew a comparison between the ongoing

Israel-Hamas conflict

and World War II. He argued that the United States' decision to drop

nuclear bombs

on Japan to end the war was the 'right decision' and suggested that Israel should be given the bombs 'they need' to end the current conflict.

""When we were faced with destruction as a nation after Pearl Harbor, fighting the Germans and the Japanese, we decided to end the war by the bombing [of]

Hiroshima

[and] Nagasaki with nuclear weapons.

That was the right decision,"" said Graham in a interview on NBC News.

Graham further explained his stance, saying, ""Give Israel the bombs they need to end the war. They can't afford to lose."" He argued that Israel should do 'whatever' is necessary to ensure its survival as a Jewish state, drawing a parallel with the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which claimed over 200,000 lives and left countless others severely traumatized.

Graham also placed the blame for civilian casualties in the conflict on Hamas, accusing the organization of using civilians in the Gaza Strip as 'human shields.' He stated, ""I think it's impossible to mitigate civilian deaths in Gaza as long as Hamas uses their own population as human shields. I've never seen in the history of warfare such blatant efforts by an enemy Hamas to put civilians at risk. The last thing you want to do is reward this behaviour.""

The Senator's comments come amid President Biden's decision to pause the delivery of heavy bombs to Israel and his warning that he would withhold more offensive weapons if Israeli forces launch a major operation in Rafah, where over a million Palestinians are seeking shelter.

The encampment, believed to be the last one standing at a Wisconsin college, will be gone by Tuesday, they said.School officials had allowed the encampment to stand and occupy a broad patch of lawn between Mitchell Hall and a busy thoroughfare on the campus's southern boundary, choosing not to call in police.That approach differed from one at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where administrators this month called in police to break down the tents after negotiations failed. After the initial crackdown failed to end the encampment, Wisconsin-Madison later came to an agreement with protesters to break down the camp voluntarily before commencement ceremonies over the weekend.Mark Mone, chancellor of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, said in a statement Wednesday that the university had exercised ""the widest possible amount of patience and restraint."" But he also indicated that patience had nearly run out, and warned that the school might take action.Under the agreement with the group of protesters, known as the UWM Popular University for Palestine Coalition, the university pledged to join calls for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas; denounce the destruction by Israeli forces of schools and universities in the Gaza Strip; and meet with protest leaders over their concerns about university investments.The university also agreed to encourage the Water Council, a Milwaukee consortium of water technology companies, to cut ties with two Israeli government-owned entities: Mekorot and the Israel Innovation Authority. Mone is treasurer of the Water Council's board of directors.In exchange, protesters agreed to take down the encampment, starting Sunday and finishing by Tuesday, and to refrain from disrupting the university's commencement ceremonies Sunday.In a statement, the protesters acknowledged the agreement.""After hard fought edits and careful consideration by the coalition, we determined we had obtained all possible benefits from the encampment,"" they said.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.","Protesters at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee will take down a pro- Palestinian encampment that had stood for two weeks.

His proposed measures include the reinstatement of the ""remain in Mexico"" policy and the Covid-era Title 42 policy, allowing swift expulsion of migrants. Furthermore, Trump has indicated a readiness to employ the National Guard and potentially federal troops to detain and deport illegal immigrants aggressively.Trump has said he will seek to detain all migrants caught crossing the border illegally or violating other immigration laws, ending what he calls ""catch and release.""Trump focused on building a wall on the Mexico border during his first term and has pledged to close gaps in the border wall if reelected.

Pakistan clears cash to calm PoK,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-clears-cash-to-calm-pok/articleshow/110093460.cms,"ISLAMABAD:

Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif approved Monday around $82.6 million (Pak Rs 2,300cr) for Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) in a bid to halt violent protests and strikes against escalating electricity tariffs , flour prices and taxes. The protests have left a police officer dead and 90 others, mostly cops, injured in the last few days.The growing unrest poses a grave challenge to Pakistan’s military, which maintains a significant presence in the region to guard the Line of Control with India.On Monday, protesters led by Awami Action Committee (AAC), an activist group that has united people to demand lower rates for essentials, continued a march to regional capital Muzaffarabad after negotiations with the govt ended in deadlock.The stalemate prompted PM Sharif, already under pressure over postponement of Saudi Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman’s crucial visit to Pakistan later this month, to clear the grant for PoK at a special meeting in Islamabad. The meeting was attended by PoK’s PM Chaudhry Anwarul Haq, local ministers and other top figures. Following the meeting, PoK PM Haq announced cuts in bread prices and electricity tariffs.Meanwhile, mobile and internet services suspended in PoK a day earlier have not been restored in most parts. Govt offices, markets, trade centres and educational institutes also remained shut.Although there have been no calls for independence in the current wave of turmoil, locals said the protests reflected a general feeling of discontent with Islamabad. In the past, Islamabad had come under fire for suppressing regional movements that demanded total independence.The recent crisis began Friday when AAC started a Muzaffarabad strike that soon snowballed into violent clashes with law-enforcement officials. The detention of over 70 activists fuelled the unrest. The movement announced its march on Muzaffarabad after talks between AAC’s core committee and PoK’s chief secretary, Dawood Bareach, in Rawalakot ended inconclusively.PM Shehbaz and President Asif Ali Zardari vowed to address the “genuine demands” of protesters, urging all to exercise restraint and resolve issues through dialogue.","Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif approved around $82.6 million (Pak Rs 2,300cr) for Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) in a bid to halt violent protests and strikes.

The Saudi ministers, seemingly, have convinced the crown prince that political situation in Pakistan is not stable, tensions run high between the military and jailed ex-PM Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), and it would be unwise for him to visit the country in the current situation,” said Shehbaz Gill , a PTI functionary and Imran’s former principal staff officer.Last month, PTI functionary Sher Afzal Marwat had alleged that Saudi Arabia was a “conduit” in the US-led operation to oust Imran’s govt in April 2022. Following his claim, PTI removed him from its core and political committee, also issuing a show-cause for trying to harm relations with Saudi Arabia.Recently, Marwat blamed the “Saudi influence” for his party dropping his name for chairmanship of public accounts committee (PAC) of parliament.While foreign ministry spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said the revised schedule of the visit is still being worked out, govt sources maintained that there were some points on the economic front that still needed to be cleared between both sides before MBS finalised his tour.They said Saudi investors and businessmen, who recently toured Pakistan, are interested in some projects but the terms of the agreement have not yet been finalised.PM Shehbaz Sharif had extended an invitation to the crown prince to visit Pakistan during his official tour to Saudi Arabia.
