'Hero Of Pakistan...': Sambit Patra's Scathing Attack On Rahul Gandhi Over Op Sindoor | BJP Vs Cong

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Tuesday filed an FIR against BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya and Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami for allegedly spreading false information, police said.The case, registered at High Grounds police station, was based on a complaint by Shrikant Swaroop B N, head of the Indian Youth Congress's legal cell.The two have been booked under Sections 192 (wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot) and 352 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.Swaroop accused Malviya and Goswami of ""masterminding a heinous and criminally motivated campaign to disseminate patently false information.""He said they ""maliciously propagated the fabricated claim"" that the Istanbul Congress Centre in Turkey is the office of the Indian National Congress.Earlier on Tuesday, Malviya posted an image comparing Rahul Gandhi to Pakistan's military leadership, accusing him of undermining India’s military and echoing Pakistan’s stance on Operation Sindoor.""This act was executed with clear and undeniable criminal intent to deceive the Indian public, defame a major political institution, manipulate nationalist sentiments, incite public unrest, and undermine national security and democratic integrity,"" Swaroop said.He also pointed out that the incident comes amid strained India-Turkey ties, worsened by Turkey’s perceived support for Pakistan.""The actions of Malviya and Goswami represent an unprecedented attack on India's democratic foundations, public safety, and national security. Their calculated misuse of influence to spread falsehoods with criminal intent demands the harshest response,"" the complaint alleged.Swaroop urged the Press Council of India, ministry of information and broadcasting, CBI, and other agencies to treat the complaint as an emergency.","The Congress on Tuesday filed an FIR against BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya and Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami.

The incident comes three days after Abu Saifullah , a high-ranking Lashkar operative and key recruiter, was gunned down by unidentified gunmen in Pakistan.Terror sympathisers on pro-Lashkar's Telegram channels were rattled on Tuesday evening, asking members to stay strong during the ""crisis"", while insisting it was an ""accident"".Hamza, who belongs to Gujranwala city in Pakistan's Punjab province, was declared a global terrorist by the US in Aug 2012. The top LeT ideologue was referred to as 'Afghan Mujahideen' and was close to Hafiz Saeed and Abdul Rehman Makki, both UN-designated terrorists belonging to Lashkar, who had appointed him on the jihadi outfit's central committee.Before he moved to handling Lashkar's propaganda, Hamza was an active terrorist who was active in India in the early 2000s. He and Saifullah were part of the group behind the 2005 attack on the Indian Institute of Science in Bengaluru. He was, however, pulled out of violent jihad and assigned to the propaganda division which he would soon head.Also read: Top LeT terrorist Abu Saiullah, behind 3 major attacks on India, eliminated in Pakistan's Sindh ""He also headed publication division of Lashkar and wrote books like Qafila Da'wat aur Shahadat (Caravan of Proselytizing and Martydom), Shahrah-e-Bahisht (The road to paradise),"" said a source.In 2018, Saeed had him form another outfit named Jaish-e-Manqafa in the wake of a ban on Lashkar and Jamat-ud-Dawah. The move had fuelled rumours of a rift in Lashkar's top brass but turned out to be a feint.According to US Treasury department, Hamza, a member of LeT's central advisory committee, actively maintained Lashkar's relationships with other groups under the direction of its emir Hafiz Muhammad Saeed.""Hamza has led an LeT-associated charity and was also an officer and member of a Lashkar's university trust that was led by Saeed. Hamza's responsibilities as of mid-2010 included publishing propaganda on behalf of Lashkar. Hamza has served as editor of an LeT weekly newspaper and was also contributing articles to the LeT publication,"" says the website.""Hamza was also one of three LeT terrorists designated to negotiate the release of detained Lashkar members and also served as the head of LeT's 'special campaigns' department,"" it adds.","Amir Hamza, a Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) co-founder, was hospitalised on Tuesday.

NEW DELHI: In the wake of the just-settled controversy triggered by Congress' objections to govt picking its members for global outreach on Pakistan-sponsored terror , senior MP Shashi Tharoor on Tuesday called for bi-partisanship on matters of security like terrorism - a line also echoed by Congress MP Manish Tewari Tharoor, who announced he would be heading a multi-party delegation despite Congress not recommending his name, has sought pan-political consensus on terror, in what could be seen as a message to his party. The post-Pahalgam row has intensified with Congress seizing upon the video comment of foreign minister S Jaishankar to accuse him of informing Pakistan in advance about the military action.In a media article, Tharoor started with a lament over political parties ""weaponising grief for electoral advantage rather than forging a unified front"" and mentioned how India's swift retaliation over the Pulwama attack in 2019 became part of the election campaign narrative - a swipe at the governing BJP. But his call for political consensus in the wake of the Pahalgam attack and the row over delegations can be seen as an appeal to Congress to eschew political and procedural issues for larger national goal.Like Tharoor, Tewari too had signalled that he would do ""national duty"" by being part of the delegation, irrespective of what Congress decided. On Sunday, as the dust settled with Congress announcing that all its members would be part of the delegation despite being picked by govt, Tewari posted on X a Hindi movie song ""Dekho veer jawaanon apne khoon pe yeh ilzaam na aaye, Maa na kahe ke mere bete waqt pada to kaam na aaye"" - implying the sense of not being found wanting in national duty.The issue of delegations, where govt picked all four members from Congress despite the parliamentary affairs minister asking Congress to submit its choices, has created bitterness.","Senior MP Shashi Tharoor calls for bi-partisanship on matters of security like terrorism.

NEW DELHI: In a significant counter-intelligence operation, Haryana Police apprehended a man accused of espionage on behalf of Pakistan, marking the second such arrest in Nuh district within 48 hours.The suspect, identified as Mohammad Tarif, a resident of Kangarka village in the Taoru police station area, has reportedly made a revealing video statement admitting to key espionage activities, including a task to photograph and film the sensitive Sirsa airbase, as reported by ANI on Monday.In the video, he allegedly details his repeated interactions with Pakistani officials, his trips to Pakistan, and how he was allegedly recruited by personnel from the Pakistan High Commission in Delhi.""I went to the Pakistan Embassy in 2018 for my visa,"" Tarif said. ""A Pakistani officer interviewed me, took my number, and later asked me to provide two new SIM cards in exchange for a visa."" He claimed that after submitting the SIMs, the officer granted him the visa, and a transactional relationship began to unfold.Tarif went on to allege that after his return from Pakistan, the same official contacted him again, urging him to refer others for visas in exchange for cash.Over time, Tarif claims to have introduced 8-10 people for this purpose.In another revelation, Tarif said, ""He called me in 2024 and said, 'you have work here; come to the Pakistan embassy.'"" During this meeting, Tarif was introduced to another Pakistani official named Jafar. ""He said I may get transferred soon, so get in touch with Jafar,"" Tarif added.Then, he added that Jafar asked him to visit the strategic Sirsa airbase, photograph it, and send the visuals. ""He said, you have to do something for us and we'll pay you in lakhs,"" Tarif claimed in his statement.Law enforcement officials have since seized Tarif’s mobile phone and placed him under extended police custody for further interrogation. Authorities have filed charges under the Official Secrets Act, 1923, and relevant sedition provisions against Tarif, as well as two Pakistan High Commission officials- Asif Baloch and Jafar.This arrest follows the earlier detention of Armaan, another resident of Nuh’s Rajaka village, on similar charges.

The commission stated that his comments revealed a misrepresentation of facts with repeated references to ""genocide,"" ""dehumanisation,"" and ""hypocrisy,"" attributing malicious communal intent to the government and the armed forces .In a paragraph in his May 9 post, this is what Mahmudabad wrote: ""Strategically, India has actually begun a new phase in terms of collapsing distinction between military and terrorist (non-state actors) in Pakistan.In effect, the response to any terrorist activity will invite a conventional response and so this puts the onus on the Pakistani military to make sure that it cannot hide any longer behind terrorists and non-state actors. In any case, the Pak military has used militarised non-state actors to destabilise the region for far too long while also claiming to be victims on the international stage. It has also used the same actors - some of whom were targeted in the recent strikes - to foment sectarian tension in Pakistan. Operation Sindoor resets all received notions of Indo-Pak relationships as the response to terrorist attacks will be met with a military response and removes any semantic distinction between the two. Despite this collapse, care has been taken by the Indian armed forces to not target military or civilian installations...""Mahmudabad responded by stating that his comments were misunderstood. He clarified that his intent was to critique warmongering rhetoric and highlight issues such as civilian suffering in wars and the need to protect all Indian citizens, including minority groups. He emphasized his support for the Indian military’s measured approach and condemned the use of terrorism by Pakistan.On May 18, 2025, Mahmudabad was arrested by the Haryana Police in connection with his social media post. The arrest was based on a complaint filed by a BJP Yuva Morcha leader. He was detained from his residence in Delhi and held at the Rai police station in Haryana.Mahmudabad filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) challenging his arrest, and the Supreme Court of India agreed to hear the case, indicating the beginning of judicial scrutiny into the circumstances and legality surrounding his detention.Mahmudabad's arrest sparked widespread support from students, colleagues, and political figures. Students from his ""Banish the Poets"" course at Ashoka University released a statement condemning his arrest, asserting that it violated academic freedom and the principles he imparted—reason, compassion, justice, and freedom of thought.They emphasized the professor’s influence in fostering meaningful dialogue and critical thinking, urging Ashoka University to support him.Colleagues from Ashoka University kept vigil at the police station in shifts, showing solidarity during his detention . The Congress party criticized the Modi-led BJP government for what it termed ""double standards,"" suggesting that Mahmudabad's identity may have played a role in his arrest.","Ali Khan Mahmudabad is an associate professor at Ashoka University.

Taylor Swift and the newly elected President Donald Trump have been in the news for their contrasting political opinions for a couple of years now. While Taylor Swift publicly supported Donald Trump’s opponent, Kamala Harris, last year, President Trump has often dragged the pop star into many controversies. Recently, President Donald Trump made a pretty derogatory post on Truth Social about Taylor Swift and the White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt recently reacted to it.As White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt took questions from the media, Fox News’ Peter Doocy asked her about President Donald Trump’s recent post about the billionaire pop star.Hearing this, Karoline Leavitt laughed at the question and said, ""Look, he is speaking about Taylor Swift's political views and how perhaps it has impacted the support of the American public for her work. And I will leave it at that.""Shockingly, this is not the first time that White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt spoke about Taylor Swift. Last year, when President Donald Trump was still campaigning, Karoline Leavitt held the post of Trump National Press Secretary.At that point, Taylor Swift was more in favour of Joe Biden and Karoline Leavitt had reacted to it and said, “This woman has made a career off of writing songs about picking the wrong guy.We should not trust her to pick the wrong guy in this presidential election.”This has sparked major outrage in 2024 but Taylor Swift had not reacted to this even back then.For the unversed, President Donald Trump made a post on Truth Social recently that read as, ""Has anyone noticed that, since I said 'I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,' she's no longer 'HOT?'”This is not the first time that President Donald Trump made a derogatory post about the billionaire pop star. President Donald Trump made similar posts when he attended the Super Bowl LIX which Taylor Swift had also attended.A few weeks ago, the Super Bowl LIX champions, the Philadelphia Eagles, visited the White House, where President Donald Trump again made a few controversial comments on Taylor Swift.The billionaire pop star and Kansas City Chiefs’ Travis Kelce’s girlfriend, Taylor Swift, has maintained her silence and has not reacted to any of the controversial comments made by President Donald Trump.Taylor Swift was last spotted around a week ago when she was out on a date with Travis Kelce as the two celebrated Mother’s Day with their families.

The Odisha Police have started an investigation into the alleged links between a Puri-based YouTuber and 'Pak spy' Jyoti Malhotra. On Saturday, May 17, Haryana Police arrested YouTuber Jyoti Malhotra on the charge of passing sensitive information to Pakistani intelligence operatives. Jyoti Malhotra runs a YouTube channel, Travel with JO. She is said to be in contact with an employee named Danish working at the Pakistan High Commission in Delhi. On May 13, India had expelled the Pakistani official for indulging in espionage.The Odisha Police did not disclose the identity of the Puri YouTuber for its investigation into the matter.A team of police personnel visited the Youtuber's residence in Puri for an investigation into the matter. According to Police, Jyoti Malhotra visited Puri in Odisha in September 2024 and came in contact with a woman who is also a YouTuber. The Puri SP Vinit Agrawa said that the Youtuber had also travelled to Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara in Pakistan recently. “We found that Jyoti Malhotra had visited Puri last year, and we are verifying the fact. Anything more can be shared after the verification,” Agrawal said.Asked whether the woman from Puri had shared intelligence inputs with Malhotra, Agrawal said, “The Haryana Police are investigating the matter and we are providing them the required assistance.” The police are also ""examining the objective"" of Malhotra's visit to Puri, and trying to find out ""where she stayed, whom she contacted and any possible suspicious activities"", the Puri SP said.In a social media post, Puri YouTuber wrote, “Jyoti was just a friend of mine, and I came in contact with her through YouTube. I was unaware of anything which she is accused of. I would not have been in touch with her if I knew she was spying for enemy Pakistan.” She added, “If any investigative agency wishes to cross-question, I would provide full cooperation. Nation is above all. Jai Hind.”The YouTuber has now made her Instagram account private, which means that only users she approves as followers can see the content on her Instagram page now.The Puri-based content creator does not have a huge following.

Indian Army’s Ferocious PoK Action; ‘All Pakistani Military Positions Smashed In Leepa Valley’

NEW DELHI: A district court on Tuesday sent Ashoka University professor Ali Khan Mahmoodabad to judicial custody over his post on Operation Sindoor. The next date of hearing in the case is May 27.Mahmudabad was arrested on Sunday after two FIRs were filed against him. He had been granted two-day police custody based on a complaint by the Haryana state commission for women.In the post, he said: ""Strategically, India has actually begun a new phase in terms of collapsing distinction between military and terrorist (non-state actors) in Pakistan. In effect, the response to any terrorist activity will invite a conventional response and so this puts the onus on the Pakistani military to make sure that it cannot hide any longer behind terrorists and non-state actors. In any case, the Pak military has used militarised non-state actors to destabilise the region for far too long while also claiming to be victims on the international stage. It has also used the same actors - some of whom were targeted in the recent strikes - to foment sectarian tension in Pakistan. Operation Sindoor resets all received notions of Indo-Pak relationships as the response to terrorist attacks will be met with a military response and removes any semantic distinction between the two.Despite this collapse, care has been taken by the Indian armed forces to not target military or civilian installations...""He clarified that his remarks were misinterpreted. He explained that his intention was to criticize war-mongering narratives and draw attention to civilian suffering during conflicts, while stressing the importance of safeguarding all Indian citizens, including minorities. He also expressed support for the Indian military’s restrained approach and condemned Pakistan’s use of terrorism.The arrest came after the Haryana women’s commission issued a notice over Mahmudabad’s social media posts, despite his clarification that his remarks were misinterpreted and were within his fundamental rights. His posts had raised concerns over the treatment of lynching victims and commented on media coverage involving Col Qureshi and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh.His arrest drew strong criticism from students, colleagues, and political leaders. Students from his “Banish the Poets” course at Ashoka University issued a statement condemning the arrest, calling it a violation of academic freedom and the values he taught—reason, compassion, justice, and freedom of thought.",Ashoka University professor Ali Khan Mahmoodabad sent to judicial custody.

'Indefensible and it must stop': European nations considering measures against Israel if it does not end Gaza blockade,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/indefensible-and-it-must-stop-european-nations-considering-measures-against-israel-if-it-does-not-end-gaza-blockade/articleshow/121305914.cms,"AP file photo





European nations are considering measures against Israel if it does not end the Gaza blockade In a recent move, Britain has decided to suspend free trade negotiations with Israel, considered as its toughest stance since the war in Gaza began in 2023. Netanyahu responded with anger as France renewed its commitment to recognise the Palestinian state, with Canada also condemning Israel’s aggressive military offensive and blockade of aid in Gaza. The EU has also ordered to review of its cooperation deal with Israel.The Belgian foreign minister, Maxime Prevot said that he had “no doubt” that Israel was violating rights in Gaza. Hungary has separately opposed additional sanctions against Israeli settlers in the West Bank.The British foreign secretary David Lammy commented, “The world is judging, history will judge them. Blocking aid, expanding the war, dismissing the concerns of your friends and partners. This is indefensible and it must stop”.The UK government is also set to impose new sanctions on individuals as well as organistaions involved in occupying the West Bank. It has announced financial and travel restrictions targeting prominent settler leader Daniella Weiss.The UK has also sought to impose restrictions on two outposts and two illegal organizations that are accused of supporting aggression in Palestine.French foreign minister Jean-Noel Barrot has reaffirmed France’s stance on recognising a Palestinian State, stating that the children of Gaza cannot be left with a legacy of hatred and violence.UK, France, and Canada have jointly threatened “concrete actions” if Israel continues to block the entry of aid into the war-battered Gaza Strip.As Israel resumed an aggressive military offensive in Gaza, 17 EU states have pushed for a review of an article under the EU-Israel agreement, which calls for safeguarding human rights. The EU-Israel agreement forms the basis of trade ties.In retaliation Israeli government said, “external pressure will not divert Israel from its path in defending its existence and security against enemies who seek its destruction.” Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Oren Marmorstein stated that it was the UK’s “own prerogative” if the British government wants to sabotage its own economy.However, on October 7, the UK had accused Hamas militants of committing a “heinous attack” and also backed Israel’s right to defend itself. The free trade negotiations between Israel and UK began in 2022.After completely cutting off aid supply more than 2 months ago, Israel is finally allowing a modicum of food and medicine supply into the Gaza Strip. This comes amid Gazans battling with the worst humanitarian crisis in 19 months of war with Israel.Despite increasing international condemnation, in a fresh offensive, Israeli strikes have killed at least 60, targeting a family home and a school turned shelter in Northern Gaza.","UK, France, and Canada have jointly threatened ‘concrete actions’ if Israel continues to block the entry of aid into the war-battered Gaza Strip.

"Tigers, jaguars and elephants are the latest to flee cartel violence in Mexico's Sinaloa",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/tigers-jaguars-and-elephants-are-the-latest-to-flee-cartel-violence-in-mexicos-sinaloa/articleshow/121305339.cms,"Photo: AP





CULIACAN: A pack of veterinarians clambered over hefty metal crates on Tuesday morning, loading them one by one onto a fleet of semi-trucks. Among the cargo: tigers, monkeys, jaguars, elephants and lions - all fleeing the latest wave of cartel violence eclipsing the northern Mexican city of Culiacan.For years, exotic pets of cartel members and circus animals have been living in a small animal refuge on the outskirts of Sinaloa 's capital. However, a bloody power struggle erupted last year between rival Sinaloa cartel factions, plunging the region into unprecedented violence and leaving the leaders of the Ostok Sanctuary reeling from armed attacks, constant death threats and a cutoff from essential supplies needed to keep their 700 animals alive.The aid organization is now leaving Culiacan and transporting the animals hours across the state in hopes that they'll escape the brunt of the violence. But fighting has grown so widespread in the region that many fear it will inevitably catch up.""We've never seen violence this extreme,"" said Ernesto Zazueta , president of the Ostok Sanctuary. ""We're worried for the animals that come here to have a better future.""Cartel factions battle Violence in the city exploded eight months ago when two rival Sinaloa Cartel factions began warring for territory after the dramatic kidnapping of the leader of one of the groups by a son of notorious capo Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman who then delivered him to U.S.authorities via a private plane.Since then, intense fighting between the heavily armed factions has become the new normal for civilians in Culiacan, a city which for years avoided the worst of Mexico's violence in large part because the Sinaloa Cartel maintained such complete control.""With the escalating war between the two factions of the Sinaloa Cartel, they have begun to extort, kidnap and rob cars because they need funds to finance their war,"" said security analyst David Saucedo . ""And the civilians in Culiacan are the ones that suffer.""Zazueta, the sanctuary director, said their flight from the city is another sign of just how far the warfare has seeped into daily life.This week, refuge staff loaded up roaring animals onto a convoy as some trainers attempted to sooth the animals. One murmured in a soft voice as he fed a bag of carrots to an elephant in a shipping container, ""I'm going to be right here, no one will do anything to you.""Veterinarians and animals, accompanied by the Mexican National Guard, began traveling along the freeway to seaside Mazatlan , where they planned to release the animals into another wildlife reserve.The relocation came after months of planning and training the animals, a move made by the organization in an act of desperation. They said the sanctuary was caught in the crossfire of the warfare because of its proximity to the town of Jesus Maria , a stronghold of Los Chapitos, one of the warring factions.'No safe place left these days' During intense periods of violence, staff at the sanctuary can hear gunshots echoing nearby, the roar of cars and helicopters overhead, something they say scares the animals. Cartel fighting regularly blocks staff off from reaching the sanctuary, and some animals have gone days without eating. Many have started to lose fur and at least two animals have died due to the situation, Zazueta said.Complicating matters is the fact that an increasing number of the animals they rescue are former narco pets left abandoned in rural swathes of the state. In one case, a Bengal tiger was discovered chained in a plaza, caught in the center of shootouts. Urban legends circulate in Sinaloa that capos feed their enemies to pet lions.Diego Garcia , a refuge staff member, is among those who travel out to rescue those animals. He said he regularly receives anonymous threats, with callers claiming to know his address and how to find him. He worries he'll be targeted for taking away the former pets of capos. Zazueta said the refuge also receives calls threatening to burn the sanctuary to the ground and kill the animals if payment isn't made.""There's no safe place left in this city these days,"" said Garcia.That's the feeling for many in the city of 1 million. When the sun rises, parents check for news of shootouts as if it were the weather, to determine if it's safe to send their kids to school. Burned houses sit riddled with bullets and occasionally bodies appear hanging from bridges outside the city. By night, Culiacan turns into a ghost town, leaving bars and clubs shuttered and many without work.""My son, my son, I'm here. I'm not going to leave you alone,"" screamed one mother, sobbing on the side of the road and cursing officials as they inspected her son's dead body, splayed out and surrounded by bullet casings late Monday night. ""Why do the police do nothing?"" she cried out.Displaced animals head for new refuge In February, while driving a refuge vehicle used for animal transport, Garcia said he was forced from the car by an armed, masked man in an SUV. At gunpoint, they stole the truck, animal medicine and tools used by the group for rescues and left him trembling on the side of the road.The breaking point for the Ostok Sanctuary came in March, when one of the two elephants in their care, Bireki, injured her foot. Veterinarians scrambled to find a specialist to treat her in Mexico, the United States and beyond. No one would brave the trip to Culiacan.""We asked ourselves, 'what are we doing here?'"" Zazueta said. ""We can't risk this happening again. If we don't leave, who will treat them?""The concern by many is that Mexico's crackdown on the cartels will be met with even more violent power moves by criminal organizations, as has happened in the past, said Saucedo, the security analyst.Zazueta blames local government and security forces for not doing more, and said their pleas for help in the past eight months have gone unanswered.Sinaloa's governor's office did not immediately respond to a request comment.The sanctuary made the move without any public announcement, worried that they might face repercussions from local officials or the same cartels forcing them to flee, but they hope the animals will find some relief in Mazatlan after years of conflict.Garcia, the sanctuary staff member, is not so sure. While he hopes for the best, he said he's also watched cartel violence spread like a cancer across the Latin American country. Mazatlan, too, is also facing bursts of violence, though nothing compared to the Sinaloan capital.""It's at least more stable,"" he said. ""Because here, today, it's just suffocating.""","The Ostok Sanctuary in Culiacan, Sinaloa, has been forced to relocate its 700 animals. The sanctuary has been caught in the crossfire of the war between rival cartel factions. Violence in the city has become the new normal for civilians in the northern city.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121305466,imgsize-511438,width-400,resizemode-4/121305466.jpg"

US secretary of state Marco Rubio slammed Democratic Senator Tim Kaine for questioning whether race played a role in the decision to grant refugee status to 59 white South African Afrikaners and said that it was you who is talking about the color of their skin.In a heated conversation at the Senate foreign relations committee session, Rubio defended the administration's acceptance of 59 Afrikaner refugees from South Africa.Kaine questioned the prioritisation of Afrikaners whilst cancelling established refugee programmes for other persecuted groups. This confrontation marked Rubio's most contentious interaction since his January confirmation hearing, occurring just before South African President Cyril Ramaphosa's scheduled White House meeting with Donald Trump.""Right now, the US refugee program allows a special program for Afrikaner farmers, the first group of whom arrived at Dulles airport in Virginia not long ago, while shutting off the refugee program for everyone else,"" said Kaine, Clinton's former vice-presidential running mate. ""Do you think Afrikaner farmers are the most persecuted group in the world?""Rubio defended the decision, stating the 49 admitted individuals had met all requirements and faced persecution in their homeland, where farms were being seized on racial grounds.This contrasted with Trump's suspension of the general refugee resettlement programme, which had affected 100,000 previously approved individuals.The debate intensified when Kaine highlighted other persecuted groups, including Uyghurs and Rohingyas. Rubio cited volume limitations, stating that millions of persecuted people worldwide couldn't all enter the US. Kaine dismissed claims of Afrikaner persecution as unfounded, noting an Afrikaner minister's presence in South Africa's coalition government.Kaine emphasised the historical absence of similar programmes for Black South Africans during apartheid, questioning the fairness of religious persecution criteria. The exchange grew tenser when discussing skin colour-based standards, with Rubio asserting US rights to prioritise admissions based on national interests.Kaine asked, “So you have a different standard based on the color of somebody’s skin. Would that be acceptable?” Rubio responded sharply, “You're the one who's talking about the colour of their skin, not me.”",US secretary of state Marco Rubio slammed Democratic Senator Tim Kaine for questioning whether race played a role in the decision to grant refugee status to 59 white South African Afrikaners.

'Targeted for speaking out against Biden admin': Gabbard





US Senator Rand Paul said on Tuesday he has documents to confirm that under the previous Joe Biden administration, the TSA (Transportation Security Administration) put Tulsi Gabbard, President Donald Trump's Director of National Intelligence, on its watchlist last year.The TSA watchlist allows federal air marshals to follow American citizens and collect information on their behaviour in an effort to stop threats from potential terrorists.""Just last night, I received the first set of records from the department (Homeland Security) regarding Tulsi Gabbard’s placement on the TSA Quiet Skies watchlist ,"" Fox News quoted Paul as saying.""These documents confirm our suspicions.

Fresh US intelligence suggests Israel's preparation for potential military action against Iranian nuclear installations, as reported by CNN, citing several US officials on Tuesday (local time). This development occurs while the Trump administration maintains its diplomatic engagement with Tehran.A source informed CNN, ""The chance of an Israeli strike on an Iranian nuclear facility has gone up significantly,"" especially if Washington cannot secure an agreement to restrict Iran's uranium enrichment programme.Although Israel has yet to make a final decision, officials familiar with the intelligence told CNN that the likelihood of a strike has grown significantly in recent months. They emphasized that Israel’s course of action will largely depend on the outcome of ongoing US-Iran negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program.The US assessment reportedly draws from both intercepted Israeli communications and observable military preparations, including the repositioning of aerial munitions and the completion of a major Israeli air exercise.However, US officials cautioned that these developments could also be part of a calculated effort by Israel to exert diplomatic pressure on Iran, rather than an indication of imminent military action.Any Israeli strike would represent a sharp departure from Trump’s current diplomatic strategy and could ignite a broader conflict in the already unstable Middle East. Since the outbreak of the Gaza war in 2023, the US has sought to prevent further escalation in the region.While Trump has threatened military action if talks with Iran break down, he has maintained a public commitment to diplomacy—for now. It was reported that in March, Trump sent a letter to Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, setting a 60-day deadline to finalize a deal. That deadline has passed, and it has now been over five weeks since talks began.Meanwhile, a senior Western diplomat told that Trump recently signaled he would allow only a few more weeks for negotiations to succeed before turning to military options.Israel finds itself at a strategic crossroads. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under pressure to oppose a US-Iran deal he sees as insufficiently robust, while also striving to maintain Israel’s vital alliance with Washington.",US intelligence suggests Israel's preparation for potential military action against Iranian nuclear installations.

WASHINGTON: The Trump administration appears to have begun deporting people from Myanmar and Vietnam to South Sudan despite a court order restricting removals to other countries, attorneys for the migrants said in court documents.Immigration authorities may have sent up to a dozen people from several countries to Africa, they told a judge.Those removals would violate a court order saying people must get a ""meaningful opportunity"" to argue that sending them to a country outside their homeland would threaten their safety, attorneys said.The apparent removal of one man from Myanmar was confirmed in an email from an immigration official in Texas, according to court documents. He was informed only in English, a language he does not speak well, and his attorneys learned of the plan hours before his deportation flight, they said.A woman also reported that her husband, from Vietnam, and up to 10 other people were flown to Africa Tuesday morning, attorneys from the National Immigration Litigation Alliance wrote.They asked Judge Brian E. Murphy for an emergency court order to prevent the deportations. Murphy, who was appointed by President Joe Biden, previously found that any plans to deport people to Libya without notice would ""clearly"" violate his ruling, which also applies to people who have otherwise exhausted their legal appeals.A hearing in the case is set for Wednesday.The Department of Homeland Security and the White House did not immediately return messages seeking comment.Some countries do not accept deportations from the United States, which has led the Trump administration to strike agreements with other countries, including Panama, to house them. The Trump administration has sent Venezuelans to a notorious prison in El Salvador under an 18th-century wartime law hotly contested in the courts.South Sudan has suffered repeated waves of violence since gaining independence from Sudan in 2011 amid hopes it could use its large oil reserves to bring prosperity to a region long battered by poverty. Just weeks ago, the country's top UN official warned that fighting between forces loyal to the president and a vice president threatened to spiral again into full-scale civil war.The situation is ""darkly reminiscent of the 2013 and 2016 conflicts, which took over 400,000 lives,"" Nicholas Haysom, head of the almost 20,000-strong UN peacekeeping mission.The U.S. State Department's annual report on South Sudan, published in April 2024, says ""significant human rights issues"" include arbitrary killings, disappearances, torture or inhumane treatment by security forces and extensive violence based on gender and sexual identity.The US Homeland Security Department has given Temporary Protected Status to a small number of South Sudanese already living in the United States since the country was founded in 2011, shielding them from deportation because conditions were deemed unsafe for return. Secretary Kristi Noem recently extended those protections to November to allow for a more thorough review.","Immigration authorities may have sent up to a dozen people from several countries to Africa, they told a judge.

US president Donald Trump on Wednesday accused the preceding Biden administration of treason by having an ""open-border"" policy that allegedly allowed criminals into the country.Writing on social media, Truth Social, Trump said it wasn't Biden but the former president's administration that was responsible for the border policy, as they were aware of the former president's cognitive decline.""Joe Biden was not for open borders, he never talked about open borders, where criminals of all kinds, shapes, and sizes can flow into our country at will. It wasn't his idea to open the border, and almost destroy our country, and cost us hundreds of billions of dollars to get criminals out of our country, and go through the process we are going through now. It was the people that knew he was cognitively impaired, and that took over the autopen,"" Trump said.This marks a noticeable change in Trump’s stance on Biden, possibly because of Biden’s recent prostate cancer diagnosis. Until now, Trump had consistently attacked him over his policies and alleged cognitive decline.Trumper further alleged that the border policy allowed criminals, drug dealers, and the mentally unstable into the country.""They did it to destroy our country. The Joe Biden that everybody knew would never allow drug dealers, gang members, and the mentally insane to come into our country totally unchecked and unvetted. All anyone has to do is look up his record,"" Trump added.Trump went on to criticise the Biden administration, accusing them of the highest ""treason."" ""They stole the presidency of the United States and put us in great danger. This is treason at the highest level! They did it to destroy our country,"" Trump said.He further warned them of severe consequences, saying, ""Something very severe should happen to these treasonous thugs that wanted to destroy our country, but couldn’t, because I came along.

'Threatened to stab if I didn't help': Jail staffer arrested for helping inmates escape New Orleans facility,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/threatened-to-stab-if-i-didnt-help-jail-staffer-arrested-for-helping-inmates-escape-new-orleans-facility/articleshow/121303427.cms,"Orleans Justice Center in New Orleans

How inmates escaped

Fifth arrest made





A prison staffer has been arrested after he reportedly admitted to have helped 10 inmates escape a New Orleans jail last week.Maintenance worker Sterling Williams was asked by one of the escapees to ""turn the water off in the cell” before the men slipped through the hole, according to a statement by the office of the Louisiana attorney general.As per an arrest affidavit, the man threatened to ""shank"" (slang for stab) Williams if the latter did not turn off the water. Another inmate tried to take Williams’ phone and attempted to get him to bring a book with cash app information.However, the affidavit noted that the 33-year-old “wilfully and maliciously assisted” the inmates, and that without his help, the group would have flooded the cell, which would have drawn attention to their efforts.Williams is charged with 10 counts of principle to simple escape and one count of malfeasance in office. Each charge carries a $100,000 bond.Michael Kennedy, his appointed attorney, said at this time “we have every intention of entering a plea of not guilty.”During a tense New Orleans City Council meeting on Tuesday, the sheriff who oversees the Orleans Justice Centre, detailed how the group escaped.""The inmates removed a sink-toilet combination unit from a cell, then cut the steel bars behind the cell room sink. After bending the bars they slipped out. It's unclear what they used to saw through the bars,"" news agency AP quoted Sheriff Susan Hutson, as saying.""There were procedural failures and missed notifications, but there were also intentional wrongdoings. This was a coordinated effort aided by individuals inside our own agency who made the choice to break the law. We are continuing to pursue everyone involved,"" Hutson added.Meanwhile, on Tuesday evening, Louisiana state police confirmed Corey Boyd, 19, became the fifth inmate to be apprehended.Boyd is accused of killing a person who caught him and others trying to break into a car in April 2024.Antoine Massey, identified in the affidavit as the inmate who threatened to stab Williams, the prison staffer, is one of the fugitives still at large.","Maintenance worker Sterling Williams was asked by one of the escapees to ""turn the water off in the cell"" before the men slipped through the hole.

US court says Trump administration may have violated order by sending migrants to South Sudan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-court-says-trump-administration-may-have-violated-order-by-sending-migrants-to-south-sudan/articleshow/121302288.cms,"Donald Trump (File Image)





The Trump administration appeared to have breached the court order by deporting several immigrants from Myanmar and Vietnam to South Sudan, a federal judge said on Tuesday.During an urgent virtual session in Boston, US district Judge Brian Murphy informed a department of justice attorney that this potential violation could amount to criminal contempt. He was weighing ordering the aircraft transporting the migrants to the African nation to return, Reuters reproted.Previously, Judge Murphy had prohibited the Trump administration from expeditiously deporting migrants to countries other than their origin without first addressing their concerns about potential torture or persecution.Legal representatives in a class action lawsuit informed Murphy that approximately eleven migrants detained in Texas were transported to South Sudan on Tuesday morning. Among them was a Myanmar national whose solicitor received notification from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement about the planned deportation.The legal team discovered their client's deportation to South Sudan on Tuesday morning. Court documents showed an email from a Vietnamese detainee's spouse at Port Isabel Detention Centre in Texas, reporting that he and ten others were presumably deported. The group included nationals from Laos, Thailand, Pakistan and Mexico, with the spouse pleading, ""Please help! They cannot be allowed to do this.""The migrants' advocates highlighted South Sudan's dangerous conditions, even for residents. The United Nations cautioned about the country's deteriorating political situation potentially rekindling the civil war that concluded in 2018.The Department of Homeland Security remained unresponsive to comment requests. In February, the department directed immigration officers to examine cases of protected individuals for possible re-detention and third-country deportation.On April 18, Murphy, appointed by Democratic President Joe Biden, issued a preliminary injunction ensuring migrants' due process rights under the Fifth Amendment. The order required advance written notice for deportations to unlisted countries and opportunities to express safety concerns.The administration must allow migrants at least 15 days to challenge deportation decisions if officials determine their safety concerns unreasonable.Murphy subsequently amended his injunction to prevent DHS from transferring migrants to other agencies for rapid deportations, following the defence department's transportation of four Venezuelans from Guantanamo Bay to El Salvador. The judge stated that similar military-operated transfers to Libya would constitute a clear violation.South Sudan’s political landscape is fragile and recent violence between government troops and armed opposition groups has escalated tensions.","Migrants from Myanmar and Vietnam were transported to South Sudan.

Pakistan Supreme Court upholds death penalty in beheading case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-supreme-court-upholds-death-penalty-in-beheading-case/articleshow/121300483.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: In a landmark judgment, the Supreme Court of Pakistan on Tuesday upheld the death sentence of Zahir Jaffer , convicted of the gruesome 2021 murder of Noor Mukadam, the 27-year-old daughter of a former Pakistani diplomat.The decision, delivered by a three-member bench led by Justice Hashim Kakar, reaffirmed the judiciary’s stance on a case that has gripped the nation and exposed deep-seated issues of gender violence and privilege in Pakistan’s elite circles. The ruling, however, also raises questions about the consistency of justice in a country where systemic inequalities often shield the powerful.The case, one of the most high-profile in Pakistan’s recent history, stems from the horrific events of July 20, 2021, when Noor Mukadam was found tortured and beheaded at Jaffer’s residence in Islamabad’s upscale Sector F-7/4.Jaffer, a Pakistani-American and son of a wealthy industrialist, was arrested at the scene, covered in blood. Investigations revealed that Mukadam, a childhood acquaintance, was held hostage for two days, tortured with a knuckleduster, raped, and ultimately decapitated after allegedly rejecting Jaffer’s marriage proposal. The brutality of the crime, coupled with the elite status of both the victim and the perpetrator, sparked nationwide outrage and reignited debates over violence against women in Pakistan.The apex court’s verdict dismissed Jaffer’s appeal, which claimed “erroneous appreciation” of evidence and questioned the fairness of the trial due to media influence. The court upheld the death penalty for murder but converted Jaffer’s second death sentence for rape to life imprisonment, citing legal considerations.“This is not just my daughter’s case; it is a case for all the daughters of Pakistan,” said Shaukat Mukadam, Noor’s father. The ruling has been hailed by many as a victory for accountability, with social media posts on X reflecting public relief: “I hope Noor’s parents will sleep a little better tonight,” wrote one user, while another called it a “win for humanity.” Yet, the decision also exposes uncomfortable truths about Pakistan’s legal and social landscape.Critics argue that the case’s prominence owes much to the victim’s elite background, highlighting a stark disparity in how justice is pursued. “Mukadam’s status as a diplomat’s daughter shone a spotlight on her murder,” said women’s rights activist Tahira Abdullah, noting that countless similar cases involving less privileged women rarely garner such attention or swift judicial action. Pakistan ranks 153 out of 156 countries in the World Economic Forum’s 2021 gender gap index, and domestic violence remains a pervasive issue, with 28% of women aged 15-49 reporting physical violence, according to the ministry of human rights.","The Supreme Court of Pakistan upheld the death sentence of Zahir Jaffer.

Pakistan promotes army chief Munir to 5-star rank of Field Marshal for ‘crushing enemy’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-promotes-army-chief-munir-to-5-star-rank-of-field-marshal-for-crushing-enemy/articleshow/121300334.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: The Shehbaz Sharif govt in Pakistan promoted Tuesday army chief Syed Asim Munir from general to the five-star rank of Field Marshal in recognition of what it described as “exemplary leadership” while responding to India’s Operation Sindoor and bringing “great honour to our motherland”.For a country that has had four military rulers at different periods in its history, Field Marshal Munir is only the second Army chief to have been elevated to the apex rank, modelled on the British army’s structure. The first one, Field Marshal Ayub Khan, assumed the rank in 1959 while he was President, citing “requests” from Pakistani civil society.PM Shehbaz’s office announced that the cabinet unanimously decided to also continue the services of Air Chief Marshal Zahar Ahmed Babar Sidhu after his term ends.The statement also claimed that Pakistan downed five Indian jets and thwarted “further incursions”, leading to a US-mediated pause in military operations from May 10. Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the army’s media affairs wing, quoted Field Marshal Munir as dedicating the honour to “the nation, armed forces, and martyrs”.In a congratulatory statement on X, Shehbaz credited Field Marshal Munir with orchestrating a “high strategy” during the conflict with India, which escalated with the latter’s May 6-7 airstrikes targeting nine terrorist sites.Operation Sindoor was India’s response to 26 deaths in the April 22 terrorist attack on tourists in J&K’s Pahalgam.Without naming India, Shehbaz said that under Field Marshal Munir, the army “crushed the enemy’s nefarious designs”.With Pakistan’s history of military coups looming large, newly coronated Field Marshal Munir is widely seen as the kingmaker behind Shehbaz’s premiership. Critics of the move within Pakistan argue the promotion strengthens the military’s grip over civilian governance, especially amid domestic challenges like the Baloch insurgency and economic woes.The timing of the promotion, coinciding with Pakistan seeking US and EU’s support to counter “India’s terrorism narrative”, suggests a bid to project strength.While the PM's office and ISPR frame Field Marshal Munir’s elevation as a tribute to national resilience, its political undertones and opaque military claims raise concerns about democratic backsliding and regional instability.","Shehbaz Sharif govt in Pakistan promoted Tuesday army chief Syed Asim Munir from general to the five-star rank of Field Marshal.

A 4.7-magnitude earthquake hit Pakistan's Swat district and nearby regions on Sunday, according to ARY News.The quake struck at a depth of 205 kilometres, with its epicentre in the Hindukush mountain range — a known seismic zone spanning parts of Afghanistan and northern Pakistan.Tremors were felt across several areas of Swat, including Mingora and its outskirts. Authorities confirmed there were no immediate reports of damage.Earlier, on May 12, a 4.9-magnitude earthquake had shaken Quetta, the capital of Balochistan.The National Seismic Monitoring Centre (NSMC) confirmed that the 4.9-magnitude tremors affected Quetta and neighbouring regions. The quake's epicentre was situated west of Quetta, according to NSMC data.The tremor came just two days after Pakistan was hit by two consecutive earthquakes on Saturday — a 5.7-magnitude quake in the morning and a 4.0-magnitude tremor later in the day, according to Reuters.Pakistan's geographical position makes it particularly vulnerable to seismic activity, as it sits at the intersection of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates. The country's territory is traversed by numerous significant fault lines, resulting in frequent and potentially damaging earthquakes.","A 4.7-magnitude earthquake hit Pakistan's Swat district and nearby regions on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan late Saturday revealed that it too would launch a diplomatic campaign led by foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari to present its narrative to the world.

Over 100 terrorists affiliated with groups like Jaish-e-Mohammed Lashkar-e-Taiba , and Hizbul Mujahideen were reportedly killed.Following the strikes, Pakistan retaliated with cross-border shelling and attempted drone incursions. In response, India launched secondary strikes targeting Pakistani military infrastructure, including radar systems and communication nodes.To consolidate international backing, union minister Kiren Rijiju announced that delegations led by prominent leaders such as Shashi Tharoor, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Sanjay Kumar Jha, Baijayant Panda, Kanimozhi Karunanidhi, Supriya Sule, and Shrikant Eknath Shinde will visit UN Security Council member states and strategic allies.“In moments that matter most, Bharat stands united.

Human rights violations in Sindh





Jeay Sindh Freedom Movement ( JSFM ), a political group advocating for Sindhu Desh, staged a peaceful sit-in protest on a highway in Pakistan on Friday, demanding the release of missing and jailed Sindhi nationalists. With traffic halted and slogans echoing through the air, the group sought global attention to enforced disappearances , illegal detentions, and human rights abuses in Sindh and Balochistan.JSFM leaders, including chairman Sohail Abro, Zubair Sindhi, and Amar Azadi, called for the immediate release of Zahid Channa, Sajad Channa, Adnan Baloch, Badshah Baloch, Rafiqat Manghanhar, and Shahid Soomro. They also demanded that false charges against them be withdrawn and that all forcibly arrested persons be freed.""This peaceful sit-in serves as a protest against the unlawful arrests of our nationalist activists, the abuses occurring in jails, and the enforced disappearances. Our effort is peaceful and democratic, and we will persist until our people are free,"" the collective statement read.The protestors warned the Hyderabad Jail authorities against further mistreatment of detainees and threatened to block the prison’s main gate if abuse continued.They also called out to international organisations like the UN, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch, urging intervention and global condemnation of Pakistan's rights violations.A 2022 US State Department report, had pointed out widespread cases of extrajudicial killings and the recovery of mutilated bodies across Sindh.In 2024, Abro had also appealed for help in the case of Priya Kumari, a missing Hindu girl, stressing rising cases of forced conversions and marriages to Muslim men.Sindhis have been historically struggling for identity and autonomy. They accuse the Pakistani state of erasing local culture through systemic oppression—citing Urdu imposition, the ‘One unit’ policy, and historic land grabs like the removal of Karachi from Sindh.Meanwhile, in related developments, Balochistan declared independence from Pakistan this week. On social media, hashtags like #RepublicOfBalochistan trended, with users sharing proposed flags and maps.","Jeay Sindh Freedom Movement (JSFM) staged a peaceful sit-in protest on a highway in Pakistan on Friday, demanding the release of missing and jailed Sindhi nationalists.

Amid many other global crises, the human rights situation in Afghanistan has been overshadowed in the international media. Millions of people continue to suffer from systemic rights violations under the Taliban-run government, a UN report has found.Tasked with assisting the people of Afghanistan, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) monitors the human rights situation in the country, issuing regular reports. In its latest update on the human rights situation in Afghanistan, UNAMA not only documented cases of gender-based violence and public floggings but also the growing persecution of the Ismaili community.Ismailism is a branch of Shia Islam, while Sunni Islam is the dominant religion in Afghanistan. Most members of the Ismaili community live in the country's northern provinces, such as Badakhshan or Baghlan. In the former, there have been at least 50 cases of members of the Ismaili community being forced to convert to the Sunni faith. Those who refused to do so were subjected to physical assaults, coercion and death threats.""They are only accepted as Muslims if they profess the Sunni faith by force,"" Yaqub Yasna, a professor and member of the Afghan Ismaili community, told DW.Yasna himself was accused of blasphemy after the Taliban takeover of 2021 because he advocated enlightenment and tolerance in society. He was forced to step down from his position at his university and went into exile for fear of reprisals.Yasna said that even before the Taliban's return to power, tolerance toward the Ismaili minority in Afghanistan was limited but that the political system had at least protected their civil rights.He said that under the Taliban, tolerance had continued to decline steadily. ""When their rights are violated today, they don't know who they can turn to. Their children are forced to profess the Sunni faith,"" he explained. ""Under Taliban rule, only one faith is considered legitimate. Anything that deviates from their interpretation of Islam is rejected and thus creates a breeding ground for violence against religious minorities. ""Afghan human rights activist Abdullah Ahmadi confirmed there was increasing pressure on one of the last remaining religious minorities in Afghanistan. ""We have received several reports showing that children from the Ismaili community are being forced to attend Sunni-run religious schools. If they refuse to do so, or do not attend classes regularly, their families have to pay heavy fines,"" he said.Ahmadi complained that the international community had responded only hesitantly to the human rights violations in his country. He called for targeted sanctions against Taliban officials, saying they ""must be held accountable.""Historically, the country was a significant center of religious diversity, but there are very few members of non-Muslim communities left in Afghanistan today.The last members of the Jewish community left the country in September 2021. Those Christians who still live there tend to practice their faith in secret. And the Hazaras, another ethnic minority in Afghanistan who are predominantly Shiite, continue to be persecuted.The Taliban only accept one interpretation of religion and have banned certain rituals and festivals, including Nowruz, which marks the beginning of spring and a new year. They declared the holiday ""un-Islamic"" and said that nobody in Afghanistan should observe the celebration.The situation of all women is also getting worse, which means that half of society is subject to systematic oppression. According to the UNAMA report, girls continue to be ""barred from participating in education beyond grade six"" and there has been ""no announcement made by the de facto authorities regarding the reopening of high schools and universities to girls and women.""In the western city of Herat, the Taliban has confiscated several rickshaws and warned drivers not to transport women who were unaccompanied by a ""mahram,"" a close male relative.Despite this disastrous situation, Afghans who fled to neighboring countries are being expelled en masse. According to the United Nations, around 110,000 people, including women and children, were forced to return in April. Large numbers of people are also being deported from Iran.""We live in fear of being deported to Afghanistan every day,"" Afghan journalist Marzia Rahimi told DW. ""What am I supposed to do with my children there?""Rahimi said that only misery and terror awaited her in Afghanistan if she returned, explaining that she had left because she was unable to continue working as a journalist under Taliban rule and would not have been able to provide her daughter with an education.Most independent media outlets have been banned or placed under the control of the state. Journalists who criticize the regime risk being arrested and tortured.Under the Taliban, the country has also been plunged into an even more catastrophic socioeconomic crisis. Some 64% of the population of 41.5 million lives in poverty, according to the UN, with 50% dependent on humanitarian aid for survival and 14% suffering from acute hunger.","The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) monitors the human rights situation in the country.

Balochistan ‘Quakes’ After Deadly Blast Near Pak Security Base; ‘Over Two Dozen Casualties…’





Four people died and 20 were injured in a car bomb explosion on Sunday night, in Qillah Abdullah, a city in Balochistan province bordering Afghanistan.Several shops and the outer wall of a nearby building housing paramilitary forces were damaged.No group has claimed responsibility for the bombing, according to deputy commissioner Abdullah Riaz, news agency AP reported.The ethnic Baloch separatists remain under suspicion as they frequently target security forces and civilians in Balochistan and other parts of Pakistan.Shahid Rind, a spokesperson for the Balochistan government, condemned the bombing and said an investigation is underway.Balochistan has been a focal point of a prolonged insurgency in Pakistan, with various separatist groups carrying out attacks, including the banned Balochistan Liberation Army , which was labeled a terrorist organization by the United States in 2019.Pakistan frequently accuses its rival India of backing the BLA and the Pakistani Taliban, both of which have escalated their attacks in Pakistan in recent months. One of the deadliest of these assaults occurred in March, when BLA insurgents killed 33 people, mostly soldiers, in an attack on a train carrying hundreds of passengers in Balochistan.On May 11, the BLA called for Indian support against Pakistan, making the appeal amid heightened tensions between the two countries.India has not yet responded to the BLA’s overture.The BLA further denied claims that it operated as an Indian proxy and said, “If we receive political, diplomatic and defense support from the world, especially from India, the Baloch nation can eliminate this terrorist state and lay the foundation for a peaceful, prosperous and independent Balochistan.”The group assured the Indian government that, if provided support, its fighters would open an additional front against Pakistan's military near the Afghan border, an area where the Pakistani Taliban maintains strongholds.","Four people died and 20 were injured in a car bomb explosion on Sunday night, in Qillah Abdullah, a city in Balochistan province bordering Afghanistan.

Afghanistan hit with fourth earthquake in as many days,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/afghanistan-hit-with-fourth-earthquake-in-as-many-days/articleshow/121260335.cms,"An earthquake struck Afghanistan on Monday morning (Image: ANI)





An earthquake of 4.2 magnitude has jolted Afghanistan in the early hours of Monday, according to the National Centre for Seismology (NCS). The tremors occurred around 08.54 am IST and were recorded at a depth of 140 kms.The NCS posted the details of the earthquake on its X account. The epicenter was located at a latitude of 36.41 N and longitude of 70.94 E. This is the fourth consecutive earthquake to hit the country in the last four days.Earlier on Sunday, a 4.5-magnitude earthquake shook Afghanistan. According to the NCS, it occurred at a depth of 150 kilometres.Previously on 17 May, an earthquake of magnitude 4.2 struck the region.On 16 May, another earthquake of magnitude 4.0 struck the region.Experts suggested that deeper earthquakes are less dangerous than shallow earthquakes because the seismic waves travel a longer distance before reaching the earth's surface due to which they lose their energy.Afghanistan has a history of powerful earthquakes. According to the Red Cross, the Hindu Kush region is a geologically active area where earthquakes occur every year.Afghanistan is situated on several fault lines between the Indian and the Eurasian tectonic plates, making it a seismically active region. A major fault line also runs directly through Herat. These plates meet and collide resulting in frequent seismic activity.According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( UNOCHA ), Afghanistan remains highly vulnerable to natural disasters. This also includes seasonal flooding, landslides and earthquakes.UNOCHA noted that these frequent earthquakes in Afghanistan can cause damage to vulnerable communities that are already struggling with decades of conflict and under-development. These challenges have left them with limited capacity to cope with multiple disasters at once.","Afghanistan is situated on several fault lines between the Indian and the Eurasian tectonic plates, making it a seismically active region.

Tommy Robinson case: Why was he jailed and why is he being released early?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/tommy-robinson-case-why-was-he-jailed-and-why-is-he-being-released-early/articleshow/121293523.cms,"Why was Robinson jailed?

Why he’s being released early





Far-right figure Tommy Robinson is set to be released from prison four months early after the UK high court reduced his 18-month sentence for contempt of court . Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon , was jailed in October 2023 for repeatedly breaching an injunction banning him from spreading false claims about a Syrian refugee. His early release follows a court ruling that accepted he had shown a willingness to comply with the order, despite lacking any clear signs of remorse.Robinson, was jailed in October 2023 for breaching a court order that prohibited him from repeating libellous claims about a Syrian teenager. The case stemmed from false allegations Robinson made in 2018, when he described then-schoolboy Jamal Hijazi as a violent bully in videos shared online. These claims were later proven to be untrue, with Hijazi successfully suing Robinson for libel in 2021 and being awarded £100,000 in damages.Following the libel ruling, an injunction was issued to prevent Robinson from repeating the defamatory statements. However, he went on to breach the order multiple times through interviews, online videos, and a speech at a public rally, which led to his conviction for contempt of court.He admitted to ten breaches of the injunction. Robinson’s actions triggered further abuse directed at the teenager, who was forced to leave school and whose family had to relocate.The sentencing judge in October imposed an 18-month prison term, which included a 14-month punitive element and a four-month coercive element—designed to pressure Robinson into complying with the injunction. He was jailed at HMP Woodhill in Milton Keynes.On Tuesday, the high court in London ruled that Robinson's sentence should be reduced, potentially allowing for his release within days. Mr Justice Jeremy Johnson, who oversaw the hearing, said Robinson had shown a “change in attitude” and accepted that he had given clear assurances not to breach the injunction again.Robinson’s legal team argued that he had taken steps to remove the offending content and had demonstrated his commitment to complying with the court’s order. His lawyer, Alex Di Francesco, said each breach capable of being “purged” had been acted upon, with most material removed from online platforms.While the judge acknowledged Robinson’s ongoing lack of remorse, he accepted that the coercive portion of the sentence had served its purpose. As a result, Robinson will only be required to complete the punitive element, which ends this week. He had originally been due for release on 26 July.",Far-right figure Tommy Robinson is set to be released from prison four months early.

Golden toilet heist: UK man avoids jail for role in £4.8m Blenheim Palace theft,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-jeweller-avoids-jail-for-role-in-48-million-golden-toilet-heist-at-blenheim-palace/articleshow/121284621.cms,"Frederick Doe, right, with his father outside Oxford Crown Court in Oxford, England (AP)





A 37-year-old jeweller from Windsor, Berkshire, has been handed a 21-month prison sentence, suspended for two years,by a UK court, for his involvement in the 2019 theft of an 18-carat gold toilet valued at £4.8 million from Blenheim Palace, the birthplace of Winston Churchill.Frederick Doe, also known as Frederick Sines, was convicted of conspiracy to transfer criminal property after attempting to broker the sale of the stolen artwork, titled ""America,"" by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan.The theft occurred in September 2019, when a group of masked thieves armed with sledgehammers and crowbars broke into the palace, removed the fully functioning gold toilet, and fled the scene in stolen vehicles. The heist, which lasted just five minutes, caused significant damage to the historic property due to flooding from the plumbed-in installation. The toilet, weighing approximately 98 kilograms, was never recovered and neither was any gold, which is believed to have been melted down.Doe's role in the crime was as a foolish middleman attempting to facilitate the sale of the stolen gold, said Judge Ian Pringle.“You had a limited function, you had no personal gain, you had no wider involvement and you were involved for a short period,"" he said, according to a report by AFP.He added that the perpetrators of the “audacious heist"" clearly aimed to offload the artwork without delay.He was found to have communicated with one of the burglars, James Sheen, about finding a buyer for the gold, referring to it using the code word ""cars."" Despite his limited involvement, Doe was convicted due to his attempts to convert the stolen property into cash.Judge Ian Pringle noted that while Doe's actions were ""foolish,"" he had been exploited by the actual thieves and did not benefit financially from the crime. The judge also considered Doe's previously good character, family responsibilities including caring for a sick wife and four children and his charitable work running a boxing club for underprivileged youth. These factors contributed to the decision to suspend his sentence and order him to complete 240 hours of unpaid community service.Two other men, James Sheen and Michael Jones, who played more direct roles in the crime, are due to be sentenced next month. The 39-year-old Jones was convicted along with Doe who was found guilty of burglary. While Sheen, pleaded guilty to charges of burglary and money laundering.The theft has been widely discussed due to the high-profile nature of the artwork.The case has drawn attention to the issue of art theft and the lengths to which individuals will go to profit from stolen cultural artifacts. Authorities continue to investigate the circumstances surrounding the theft and the fate of the stolen toilet.","Frederick Doe, 37, handed 21-month prison sentence, suspended for two years.
