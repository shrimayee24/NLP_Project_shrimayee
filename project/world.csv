In Mandi, hundreds gathered on Jail Road, protesting against a mosque that partially stands on Public Works Department (PWD) land.The police used water cannons and tear gas to disperse the protesters and imposed prohibitory orders to prevent gatherings of five or more people.Protestors, chanting Hanuman Chalisa, attempted to breach barricades near the mosque.The protests in Mandi followed similar unrest in Shimla’s Sanjauli area, where violent demonstrations erupted over another mosque’s illegal construction. In both cases, Hindu organisations have been calling for the demolition of unauthorised structures.The situation in Mandi escalated after the local court ordered the demolition of the illegal portion of the mosque within 30 days, a decision announced just hours before the protests.According to authorities, members of the mosque committee had already started demolishing the disputed structure, located on PWD land. Iqbal Ali, a representative of the mosque committee, stated that the community had voluntarily removed the illegal section. However, despite these efforts, protests still broke out, with more than 700 police personnel deployed to maintain law and order.As tensions persist, authorities are working to calm the situation, with both the Mandi and Sanjauli mosque controversies now under the spotlight. Political figures like BJP spokesperson Chetan Bragta have criticized the government’s response, while the local Muslim community has expressed a willingness to follow legal procedures. Several FIRs have been filed in connection to the protests, and police injuries were reported during earlier clashes in Shimla.","Hindu groups demand action against alleged illegal construction of a mosque in Shimla.

According to Bower, Harry expected his family to see similarities between his late mother, Diana, and Meghan, but was left disappointed. “No one agreed that his vulnerable mother had anything in common with his girlfriend. More discomforting for him, they thought Meghan would not fit in with the Royal Family ,” Bower wrote. As Mirror.co.uk reports, this sentiment was voiced by Charles Spencer, Diana's brother, who, at the request of Prince William, weighed in on the matter.Spencer, who had been married three times, reportedly urged his nephew to reconsider rushing into marriage. His words, however, provoked a strong reaction from Harry, who later reflected on how difficult it was to establish Meghan’s place in the family.Earl Spencer wasn’t the only person to express doubts about Harry and Meghan’s relationship. According to Bower, Meghan's former talent agent, Gina Nelthorpe-Cowne, also cautioned the former actress that Royal life would mean giving up her career. Meghan, however, did not take this advice well and reportedly reacted with “hard fury” at the notion she would have to stop acting.Despite these 'warnings', Harry and Meghan went on to marry in 2018. However, tensions within the Royal Family have been well-documented, and the couple stepped back from their Royal duties in 2020.","Earl Spencer was reportedly asked to counsel his nephew on the difficulties Meghan might face in adjusting to royal life.

Coastal residents in certain areas have been evacuated to safer locations. Additionally, numerous air travelers have been impacted by the cancellation of hundreds of flights at Shanghai's two airports since Sunday evening.

China censors allow a Ye gig amid economic woes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/china-censors-allow-a-ye-gig-amid-economic-woes/articleshow/113378507.cms,"BEIJING: When the news broke that Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West , would be performing in China on Sunday, the elation of many of his fans was mixed with another emotion: confusion. Why would the notoriously prickly Chinese govt let in the notoriously provocative Ye? Why was the listening party, as Ye calls his shows, taking place not in Beijing or Shanghai, but in Hainan, an obscure island province? Under a trending hashtag on Weibo on the subject, one popular comment read simply, ""How?"" alongside an exploding-head emoji.The answer may lie in China's struggling economy.Since China reopened its borders after three years of Covid lockdowns, the govt has been trying to stimulate consumer spending and promote tourism. Even before the pandemic, the number of big-name foreign entertainers visiting China had been falling as authorities tightened controls on speech. Acts such as Bon Jovi and Maroon 5 had shows abruptly cancelled, leading to speculation that band members' expressions of support for causes like Tibetan independence were to blame. Justin Bieber was barred from China in 2017 over what the Beijing city govt, without specifying, called ""bad behaviour.""Ye might have seemed like a no-go, too. Chinese authorities declared war on hip-hop in 2018, with the state media saying that artists who insulted women and promoted drug use ""don't deserve a stage."" But in Ye's case, objections to hip-hop may have been outweighed by the potential payoff - especially for Hainan.For years, the govt has sought to turn Hainan, an island roughly the size of Maryland or Belgium, into an international commercial hub. It offers visa-free entry and duty-free shopping, and has pledged to attract more world-class cultural events. Sheng Zou, a media scholar, said enforcement of censorship was capricious. ""When it comes to Ye, I guess his celebrity status may outweigh his identity as a hip-hop artist.""","Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, will be performing in China on Sunday.

In 2023, Donald Trump posted the video interview of Laura and wrote 'Thank You'. Months later, it is Laura Loomer who has become a headache of the Republican campaign and Donald Trump had to distance himself from her rabble-rousing that she does for Trump.Laura Loomer recently created a major stir in the GOP after she said the White House will smell of curry if Kamala Harris becomes the president. This was not her first attack on Kamala Harris but this rattled even Republicans like Marjorie Taylor Greene who said Laura Loomer does not represent the party and this makes Donald Trump look bad.But Laura's proximity with Donald Trump set the tongues wagging as Laura joined Trump before the ABC News presidential debate, then she was with Trump at a 9/11 event.Donald Trump reacted to the controversy and said Laura Loomer is a private citizen and she does not work for his campaign. Trump said he does not agree with the statement that she made but accepts her support. ""...like the many millions of people who support me, she is tired of watching the Radical Left Marxists and Fascists violently attack and smear me..."" Trump posted.Laura Loomer said she is neither an adviser of Trump nor a staff and hence there is nothing like 'Trump distancing from' Laura. ""I don't care about what they say about me. I care about one thing: Donald Trump winning,"" Laura said.It is the same emotion that she expressed in the interview the clip of which is going viral. Laura was asked how intimidating she was for a fellow to ask her out. ""Well. It’s not like I’m vicious in that sense, but a lot of people just can’t handle my lifestyle. I am very busy. Just you know, I will tell you a funny story. I dated somebody one times and they thought that I was too focused on Trump. And they said that I gave my activism in support of President Trump more attention that I gave them,"" she said.""And it’s like, yeah, that’s right. Because Trump is more important than you. Trump is going to save our country. And so you need to understand that President Trump is more important than you.

During an American chat show 'Fox & Friends' interview, Trump criticised the debate moderators for their biased stance. “It was three to one. It was a rigged deal, as I assumed it would be"", said Trump.""The press is so dishonest in this country, it's amazing,"" said Trump, claiming he only receives negative coverage, according to Fox News .Davis defended her approach, saying that her team had intended to fact-check both candidates.

The poll , conducted over two days after the showdown, shows Harris leading Trump 47% to 42%—a five-point margin that has expanded since late August.The debate, marked by sharp exchanges and personal attacks, saw Harris relentlessly press Trump on his fitness for office and ongoing legal troubles.Polling suggests voters saw her as the clear winner, with 53% believing Harris outperformed Trump, compared to just 24% who backed Trump’s performance. A CNN flash poll painted an even starker picture, with 60% of viewers saying Harris dominated the stage.Pundits were quick to declare Harris the victor, noting how she repeatedly backed Trump into a corner. According to Reuters , Harris ""put Trump on the defensive with a barrage of attacks on his record and legal woes,"" a view echoed by 52% of poll respondents who felt Trump struggled to keep up.For Harris, the poll is a welcome rebound after a recent New York Times/Siena College survey—widely regarded as highly accurate—showed her trailing Trump by a single point. That poll had put Trump at 48% to Harris' 47%, a razor-thin margin that had fueled anxiety within Democratic circles.Despite the positive numbers, the race remains tight, with battleground states like Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Wisconsin holding the keys to the White House. National polls, while promising, offer only a snapshot of the larger fight for electoral votes.In a bid to capitalize on her debate momentum, Harris' campaign swiftly challenged Trump to a second face-off, with Fox News offering to host the rematch. “Vice President Harris is ready for round two. Is Donald Trump?” her team asked in a pointed post-debate statement.Trump, meanwhile, has wavered on whether he’s game for another debate, calling the push for a second round a sign of desperation from the Harris camp. However, he’s left the door open depending on the host network.As the dust settles, the next major clash will be between the vice presidential nominees—Ohio Senator JD Vance and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz—who are scheduled to debate on October 1, setting the stage for yet another high-stakes political face-off.","A new Reuters/Ipsos poll shows Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of former President Donald Trump.

This practice had been observed for Meghan's 40th birthday and Prince Andrew's 60th, irrespective of the controversies surrounding them.The complex and often fraught relationship between the Sussexes and the Royal Family has been evident since their departure from royal duties in 2020. While the birthday messages appear amicable, they come after months of silence and distancing by royal officials, who have been guarded in addressing matters related to Harry and Meghan. Insiders have indicated that King Charles remains open to reconciliation but is cautious of further public leaks or media scrutiny.The relationship between Harry and his brother, Prince William, is said to be more fractured, with the two not having communicated for over two years due to Harry's public criticism of his brother and sister-in-law, Catherine. Although Harry has expressed a desire to maintain some connections with the UK through his charitable work, he has no intention of resuming royal duties, further complicating any potential reconciliation.The public birthday wishes , while adhering to royal tradition, serve as a poignant reminder of the deep divide between Meghan, Harry, and the Royal Family, with both parties seemingly navigating their interactions with great care.","Prince Harry's 40th birthday was celebrated with a public message from King Charles and Prince William.

RFK Jr. says he faces federal investigation for decapitating whale. What is the case about?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/rfk-jr-says-he-faces-federal-investigation-for-decapitating-whale-what-is-the-case-about/articleshow/113373437.cms,"What is the case about?

Former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced on Saturday that he is under federal investigation related to a 1994 incident involving a whale. Speaking at a campaign event for former President Donald Trump in Glendale, Arizona, Kennedy revealed he received a letter from the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) regarding allegations that he unlawfully collected a whale specimen two decades ago.Kennedy, 70, contends that the investigation is politically motivated. ""This is all about the weaponization of our government against political opponents,"" he stated, expressing frustration over the renewed scrutiny. Although he did not provide specifics about the whale incident, he referenced an account from his daughter, Kathleen ""Kick"" Kennedy.The controversy stems from a 2012 interview with Kick Kennedy, who described how her father used a chainsaw to sever the head of a dead whale that had washed ashore near Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. The whale’s head was then transported strapped to the family car, causing a mess and unpleasant odor during their drive back to New York.The Center for Biological Diversity Action Fund (CBDAF) has called for a federal investigation into Kennedy's actions, arguing that they may have violated the Marine Mammal Protection Act and possibly the Endangered Species Act. They also claim that transporting the whale head across state lines could be a felony under the Lacey Act, which governs wildlife transport.Kennedy has denied the allegations, insisting he has never engaged in illegal wildlife activities. In response to the investigation, he criticized the media for focusing on what he describes as ""gossipy nonsense"" rather than serious policy issues, according to Sky News.This investigation follows another controversy from August, where Kennedy admitted to a prank involving a dead bear cub in New York City’s Central Park. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation noted that such disposal methods were illegal, although the statute of limitations had expired, NBC News reported.","Former independent presidential candidate Robert F.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) chief Imran Khan blamed the establishment, a euphemism for the military in Pakistan, for the disappearance of his party’s chief minister of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Ali Amin Gandapur , from Islamabad.Speaking to journalists at Rawalpindi prison on Friday, Khan claimed that Gandapur “was disappeared” by elements within the establishment and everyone knows who is responsible for such actions, an indirect reference to Pakistan’s intelligence agencies.He accused the military establishment of undermining the country’s institutions.According to Khan, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa CM has remained silent over his disappearance out of loyalty and respect for the establishment. Khan warned the current situation in the country is reminiscent of “Yahya Khan Part II”.Imran also spoke on the current state of governance, claiming that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif required approval (from the military) for every decision and could soon face a similar fate — disappearance.Gandapur went missing from Islamabad during a crackdown on PTI last Monday, a day after he had delivered a hard-hitting speech at a rally demanding the release of Imran Khan. He later turned up in Peshawar. Gandapur, according to PTI, was invited by the military authorities to discuss law and order matters, but he was allegedly detained without consent. His statement that he would personally secure Khan’s release in the next two weeks triggered a sharp backlash in a country where the powerful military has directly ruled the country for three decades and wielded enormous political influence even when civilian governments were in office.","Imran Khan blames the establishment for the disappearance of his party’s chief minister of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Ali Amin Gandapur.
