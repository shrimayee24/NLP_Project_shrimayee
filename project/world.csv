"SC ends logjam: TN gets power to appoint, sack VCs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-ends-logjam-tn-gets-power-to-appoint-sack-vcs/articleshow/120111193.cms,"CHENNAI: Long-term constitutional consequences apart, the immediate impact of the Supreme Court's landmark ruling on the governor's duties and powers will be the end of stalemate over appointment of vice-chancellors to nine of Tamil Nadu's 22 state universities. Many of these universities have remained headless for more than two years as Raj Bhavan had been sitting on the bills.The AIADMK govt's Fisheries University Bill, which seeks to rename the university after the late former chief minister Jayalalithaa, too has been pending for more than four years.Also, these bills also empower the state govt to remove vice-chancellors on grounds of wilful omission or refusal to carry out the provisions of the law or abuse of powers vested in them. Nomination of members to Senate and Syndicate, besides academic councils of universities, will also become the sole prerogative of the state govt henceforth.""The bills have now become acts, and they would come into force once the state govt notifies them. The governor will not have any more role to play in the appointment of vice-chancellors to state universities,"" senior advocate and DMK MP P Wilson told TOI. The state can now proceed with the constitution of search panels for the appointment of VCs, he said.However, the governor will continue to be chancellor of universities, Wilson said, adding that he would be toothless as all powers, including conducting campus inspections, will be taken over by govt. ""Today's judgment has reiterated the fact that the power of the governor under the Constitution is limited. The governor does not have any vested constitutional right to be a chancellor of the university. The state can make any law that comes under the purview of its law-making power,"" said senior advocate K M Vijayan.As of now, Anna University, Bharathiar University, Bharathidasan University, Madurai Kamaraj University, Tamil Nadu Teachers Education University, Annamalai University, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University and Tamil Nadu Physical Education and Sports University have been functioning without vice-chancellors.Though the other universities may get vice-chancellor search committees, the University of Madras may have to wait a little longer as the amendment to the University of Madras Act, 1923 would need the President's assent. Now that the state has wrested the power to appoint VCs, educationists urged the state govt to take great care in nominating members to vice-chancellor search committees.",The Supreme Court's landmark ruling on the governor's duties and powers will be the end of stalemate over appointment of vice-chancellors to nine of Tamil Nadu's 22 state universities.

He said Congress is not associated selectively with any group.The remark at the meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) reportedly came after some questions from party leaders about clarity on political strategy. It has been a subject of debate in political circles and in Congress on how to address the hard polarization pitch of BJP. Rahul stated he had no confusion about the strategy.The extended CWC, led by Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul, met at the Patel Memorial here for around four hours to discuss the resolution that will be placed before the AICC session on Wednesday.Sources said the mention of the Palestine-Israel conflict also came in for suggestions from members. Some reportedly felt the passing reference about the Modi govt's silence on bombardment of innocents was not enough and required detailing. Rahul also pitched strongly for ""social justice"" issues like caste census, even as he rubbished that Congress could be confined merely to Dalits, minorities, as is the case in popular parlance.Many members gave their views on different aspects of the resolution. Sources said senior MP from Kerala Shashi Tharoor argued that Congress should not just criticize but should be constructive and should also offer alternatives and options. There was a discussion on US tariffs on India, and also the foreign policy. MP Manish Tewari, sources said, expressed strong views on the Chinese encroachment in the Ladakh region. Some also demanded greater emphasis on the waqf bill's criticism.While the resolution remains under the wraps, it is learnt that the document contains all the national issues, from alleged ""divisive politics"" and ""Hindu vs Muslim"" of the BJP-RSS to ""assault on the Constitution and federalism"", ""compromised foreign policy"" of Modi regime based on ""personal branding"", with references to US, Chinese encroachment, return of hardline in Bangladesh. A key reference is likely to be on social justice, with a focus on caste census and higher quotas, and Congress's role in the first Constitutional amendment of 1951 to safeguard reservations, implementation of Mandal commission and OBC quota in educational institutions, and Modi govt's ""dereservation"" drive through privatization and contractual employment.","Rahul is learnt to have mentioned that a community, be it Christian, Muslim, Sikh, OBC or deprived classes, be named.

NEW DELHI: Trinamool Congress MP Saugata Roy on Tuesday said he saw Mahua Moitra in tears following a spat with party colleague Kalyan Banerjee outside the Election Commission office last week, and urged that Banerjee be removed from his position as the party’s chief whip in the Lok Sabha over repeated ""uncivilised"" conduct.“I was not there when this altercation between Kalyan Banerjee and Mahua Moitra took place. I was at Vijay Chowk and the spat took place in front of the Election Commission office. I saw Mahua crying and complaining to several MPs, of other parties also, about Kalyan's behaviour,” Roy told reporters in Kolkata, according to a PTI report.According to a PTI source from TMC, the spat occurred on April 4 when a party delegation went to the Election Commission to raise the issue of duplicate voter ID numbers. Following the meeting, the group also marched to Parliament.Kalyan Banerjee had been tasked with getting TMC MPs to sign a memorandum to be submitted to the EC. Moitra reportedly confronted him after discovering her name was not included among the signatories and slammed him for it outside the EC office, reported PTI.A war of words ensued. Kalyan Banerjee later alleged that Moitra had even asked security personnel at the EC office to arrest him.Roy said Moitra had not spoken to him directly, but told another MP about Kalyan Banerjee’s behaviour. “She said that he (Banerjee) behaved in an uncivilised manner,” he said.Taking a sharp dig at Kalyan Banerjee, Roy said, “I feel it is beneath my dignity to reply to whatever Kalyan Banerjee may have said. His uncivilised behaviour had been in our focus several times.”He cited a string of past incidents: “He called (Union Minister) Jyotiraditya Scindia ‘lady killer’ and later apologised to him. During the JPC meeting on Waqf, he broke a bottle and threw it at the chairman of the panel. Kalyan is known for his intemperate and uncivilised behaviour. So far, I did not speak about it because it’s beneath my dignity. I heard from you that he has said things against me and that’s why I have replied.”Roy said Kalyan Banerjee was not fit to serve as the party's chief whip in the Lok Sabha. “That Kalyan is not fit to be on the post is apparent to me. I have not said it so far, but because of his behaviour and his incorrect English. But now, I think the time has arrived to see into it,” he said.“I do not expect Kalyan to uphold my dignity. I think I can do that... I have been in Parliament for five years, in Assembly for another five and these are pretty long tenures for people to judge. I don't want Kalyan Banerjee's certificate. Let him learn his English first,” Roy added.He said he would leave the final decision to party supremo Mamata Banerjee: “But I leave it to Mamata Banerjee’s judgment.”Meanwhile, BJP leader Amit Malviya shared purported screenshots of a WhatsApp group of TMC MPs, showing Kalyan Banerjee clashing with party MP Kirti Azad. The screenshots suggested that Kalyan Banerjee had referred to Moitra in veiled terms, calling her a “versatile international lady”.In one message, Kalyan Banerjee allegedly wrote: “Send your BSF and Delhi Police to arrest me. Your home ministry connection is a very strong international great lady.”Another message read: “Today I congratulate the gentleman who opened the beautiful activities of a versatile international lady. That day not a single boyfriend of hers stood behind her. This foolish man whom she wanted to arrest by BSF, stood behind her. Today of course 30 years famous player stood behind her to get me arrested.”Kirti Azad, in response, could be seen asking Kalyan Banerjee not to act like a “juvenile delinquent.”An undeterred Kalyan Banerjee continued his tirade, reportedly calling Azad the “captain of... internal politics” and further wrote: “Your popularity is so much that you lost election in cricket. Let me see your power to get me arrested for your friend. Do not worry I will go to Durgapur and open your musk (sic).”According to another TMC source, tensions between Kalyan Banerjee and Azad had flared earlier as well — over something as mundane as a proposal by Azad to open a stall selling sandesh, a Bengali sweet, in Parliament. Kalyan Banerjee reportedly objected to the idea unless it was a franchise of the West Bengal government.", Trinamool Congress MP Sougata Roy said he saw Mahua Moitra crying after a spat Kalyan Banerjee.

Jaipur Congress president R R Tiwari suspended Khan later in the day.Police said Khan had been travelling at approximately 70km/h when his SUV crashed into four cars and six two-wheelers over a 500m distance on Nahargarh Hill, causing extensive damage. Additional DCP Bajrang Singh Shekhawat said the accident occurred near Nahargarh PS, where the SUV initially hit three people on a scooter. Witnesses said the SUV was uncontrolled as it moved through the narrow streets, causing pedestrians to flee. Residents chased the vehicle and stopped it near Foota Khurra, where an angry mob allegedly caught the driver and took him to Nahargarh PS. Khan was detained for questioning early on Tuesday.While two people - Avdesh Pareek, 37, and Mamta Kanwar, 50, - died of injuries at SMS Hospital on Monday night, the third victim, Virendra Singh, 30, succumbed during treatment on Tuesday, Nahargarh SHO Rameshwari said. The injured were hospitalised, and two among them were in critical condition, police said.Investigators were probing a possible connection to an earlier accident in the city's MI Road area involving the same vehicle.

No-trust move against J&K Speaker over Waqf debate ‘gag’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-trust-move-against-jk-speaker-over-waqf-debate-gag/articleshow/120103917.cms,"SRINAGAR/JAMMU: Waqf law rocked J&K assembly for the second day Tuesday as opposition PDP and Sajad Lone’s People’s Conference brought a no-confidence motion against Speaker Abdul Rahim Rather for not allowing a debate on the act. Rather’s own party, the governing NC, urged him to show flexibility and permit the discussion.BJP, however, supported the Speaker for his decision on Monday disallowing discussions on the law. Rather insisted the law had been challenged in Supreme Court and assembly rules prohibited discussions on a sub-judice case. The row had flared after opposition members targeted CM Omar Abdullah for taking a walk in Srinagar’s Tulip Garden with Union minister Kiran Rijiju, who had piloted the Waqf bill in Parliament.On Tuesday, PDP legislator Waheed Parra displayed a resolution on Waqaf law, asking the Speaker to allow the debate. Lone and other legislators joined in. When Parra persisted, he was marshalled out on Rather’s orders, stoking the tensions.Earlier in the House, NC members had asked the Speaker to understand the sense of the House and allow the discussion. NC legislator and chief spokesman Tanvir Sadiq said 25 members of his party had sought a debate and urged the Speaker to allow it. Rather was unmoved, leading to adjournment of the House. “There is no rule that bars discussion (in the assembly) on any law passed by Parliament,” Parra said outside. Speaking later in the day about his decision and the members’ protests, Rather said: “If the House has no confidence, then I have no right to be there.”Earlier, when the House had reassembled in the afternoon, Lone moved a formal no-confidence seeking the Speaker’s removal. The motion was signed by three PDP legislators, including Parra. Lone cited outrage over Rather’s actions. “Such conduct undermines democratic principles governing this esteemed institution (assembly). J&K is the only Muslim province in India. History will hold us in contempt if we do not send a strong message against this bill,” Lone said. He called the Speaker an impediment in voicing “our opinion against the law”.Lone went to the extent of asking Rather to retire to his chamber and hand charge to deputy Speaker Mubarak Gul for the Waqf discussion. This angered NC, which refused to support the motion against Rather. “He is the senior-most leader of the party (NC) and has presented over a dozen budgets as (J&K) finance minister. We are only asking him that the rules cannot override the mandate and sentiments of people. We hope he shows some flexibility,” NC’s Salman Sagar said.Rather cited rules and stuck to his stand. “If it is not the concern of this govt, the motion (for a Waqf) discussion cannot be taken up,” Rather said. BJP members thumped tables in his support. Amid the uproar, deputy CM Surinder Choudhary pleaded with the Speaker to understand the sentiments. “We have been elected by the people. If it is the concern of the members, it is the concern of the govt, too,” NC’s Choudhary said.Eventually, the house was adjourned for the day without any business, with Rather in focus rather than the Waqf la",Opposition PDP and Sajad Lone’s People's Conference brought a no-confidence motion against Speaker Abdul Rahim Rather for not allowing a debate on the act.

What is Alien Enemies Act at centre of Trump deportation win in Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-alien-enemies-act-at-centre-of-trump-deportation-win-in-supreme-court/articleshow/120083449.cms,"AP photo

What is Alien Enemies Act?

The

Alien Enemies Act

is a wartime law that gives the president the power to deport immigrants from countries considered enemies during a time of war.

During his campaign, Donald Trump said he planned to use the Act, which has not been enforced since World War II, when it was used to detain Japanese Americans.

The law is meant to be used when the US is at war with another country, or if a foreign nation attacks or threatens to attack the US.

To use the Act, the president must officially declare the event that triggered its use. The law stays active until the president ends it.

The Trump administration argued that foreign drug cartels could be treated as an “invasion” or “predatory incursion,” allowing it to invoke the law.

The US supreme court on Monday lifted a lower court's order that had blocked the deportation of undocumented Venezuelan migrants under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act (AEA)—a wartime law.In a narrow 5–4 ruling, the justices allowed deportations to resume, siding with the Trump administration ’s decision to expel the migrants under a proclamation targeting the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. However, the court also said that those deported under the AEA must be given a fair chance to challenge their removal in court.Trump praised the court’s decision in a post on his Truth Social: “The supreme court has upheld the rule of law in our nation by allowing a president, whoever that may be, to be able to secure our borders, and protect our families and our country, itself. A great day for justice in America!”","The US supreme court on Monday lifted a lower court's order that had blocked the deportation of undocumented Venezuelan migrants under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act.

"Military, Imran Khan, Shehbaz Sharif clash amid US, diaspora influence",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/military-imran-khan-shehbaz-sharif-clash-amid-us-diaspora-influence/articleshow/120104390.cms,"File photo: Former Pakistani PM Imran Khan (Picture credit: ANI)

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s political landscape remains a battleground of competing forces, with the military, former prime minister Imran Khan, and the current govt under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif locked in a tense struggle.The interplay of US foreign policy and the Pakistani diaspora’s growing voice adds further complexity to a nation grappling with economic woes, security threats and democratic erosion.Imran Khan, ousted in April 2022 via a no-confidence vote, continues to challenge the status quo from behind bars. Convicted on corruption and state secret charges, the cricketer-turned-politician retains a fervent base, accusing the military and Sharif’s govt of colluding with the US to orchestrate his downfall.Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) alleges widespread rigging in the Feb 2024 elections, which saw Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) secure power through a fragile coalition. PTI supporters, galvanised by Khan’s claims, have staged protests, clashing with the security forces and deepening the political divide.The military, longtime kingmaker in Pakistani politics, appears to have shifted allegiance. Once Khan’s backer in his 2018 rise, the army soured on him after policy disputes and his public criticisms of General Asim Munir, the current army chief.Analysts suggest the military now props up Sharif’s govt, a dynamic evident in legislative moves like the 2023 Pakistan Army Act amendment, which stifled dissent and empowered the armed forces. This hybrid regime – blending electoral democracy with military influence – has drawn scrutiny for undermining constitutional norms, yet the generals show no sign of relinquishing their grip.However, Shehbaz Sharif, re-elected in March 2024 as PM, faces a legitimacy crisis. His coalition, including the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) and other smaller factions, struggles to address surging militant attacks, crumbling infrastructure, and an economy reliant on IMF bailouts.Sharif vows to mend ties with Washington but his govt’s dependence on military support raises questions about its autonomy. Khan’s call for an election audit, echoed in a letter to the IMF, threatens to derail these efforts as Pakistan awaits a critical loan installment.The US role remains contentious. Khan’s unproven claims of a Washington-led conspiracy resonate with a populace wary of foreign interference, a sentiment rooted in decades of strained relations. The Biden administration, while engaging Sharif’s govt, has maintained robust military ties with Pakistan, prioritising counter-terrorism over democratic concerns. This ambivalence has fuelled Khan’s narrative, even as US officials dismiss his allegations.Meanwhile, the Pakistani diaspora, particularly in the US, has emerged as a vocal force. Pro-democracy activists, many aligned with PTI, have lobbied Congress, securing bipartisan support for resolutions condemning elections irregularities and Khan’s detention. Over 100 lawmakers have urged his release, while some advocate sanctions against military leaders like Munir. This diaspora-driven pressure marks a shift, challenging the traditional US-Pakistan security nexus.As Pakistan teeters between chaos and stability, the military’s shadow looms large, Khan’s defiance endures, and Sharif’s govt navigates a treacherous path. With the US and Pakistani diaspora adding external weight, the nation’s democratic future hangs in the balance.","Imran Khan, ousted in April 2022 via a no-confidence vote, continues to challenge the status quo from behind bars.

LIVE: Spain's prime minister to visit China

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has embarked on a diplomatic trip to Asia, visiting Vietnam as US tariffs on European Union products come into effect.Sánchez lands in Hanoi on Wednesday, where he will meet Vietnam’s top leader, To Lam. On Thursday, Sánchez is set to visit Ho Chi Minh City, where he will meet with business leaders to strengthen commercial ties and discuss potential investment opportunities between Spain and Vietnam.The Spanish leader will then head to China on Friday, marking his third visit in just over two years. There, he is expected to meet President Xi Jinping and several Chinese investors.US president Trump on Tuesday imposed an additional 50% tariff on Chinese goods after Beijing refused to remove retaliatory measures. These steps have pushed the cumulative US tariffs on Chinese imports to 104%.Sánchez has previously taken a softer stance on China compared to other EU leaders. During a visit to Beijing in September 2024, he urged the EU to reconsider plans to impose steep tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, advocating instead for fair and balanced trade rules. The European Union in response said the tariffs were needed to protect local manufacturers from unfair competition by Chinese companies that receive state support.Brussels, however, has recently indicated a desire to improve relations with Beijing. After Donald Trump returned to the White House in January, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called for “constructive engagement with China.” The EU’s trade commissioner, Maros Sefcovic, also visited China to push for a more balanced and cooperative trade partnership.Pedro Sánchez is now the first EU leader to visit the region since Donald Trump's re-election. His trip signals the beginning of what could be a broader diplomatic push from Europe, as they look to Asia for alternative partnerships and trade opportunities.","Pedro Sánchez lands in Hanoi on Wednesday, where he will meet Vietnam’s top leader, To Lam.

North Korea’s position as a nuclear weapons state cannot be reversed, no matter how much the United States and its Asian partners demand it, according to a statement by the sister of North Korea’s top leader Kim Jong-un, reported by state media on Wednesday.The remarks were likely a reply to a joint statement made by the foreign ministers of South Korea, Japan, and the United States during a Nato meeting last week.The three ministers repeated their ""commitment to the complete denuclearization"" of North Korea, according to the statement.North Korea’s nuclear weapons status, along with its ""substantial and very strong nuclear deterrent ,"" is a result of outside threats and ""it does not change no matter how desperately anyone denies,"" said Kim Yo Jong, the sister of leader Kim Jong Un, according to North Korea's KCNA news agency.She noted that North Korea’s plans to grow its nuclear weapons are written into its constitution, and said that any outside talks about denuclearization are ""the most hostile act"" and amount to denying the country’s sovereignty.""If the US and its vassal forces continue to insist on anachronistic denuclearization’ … it will only give unlimited justness and justification to the advance of the DPRK aspiring after the building of the strongest nuclear force for self-defense,"" she said, using the initials for North Korea’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.She added that North Korea’s nuclear weapons status can ""never be reversed by any physical strength or sly artifice.""""We don’t care about anyone’s denial and recognition and we never change our option,"" she said. ""This is our steadfast choice that can never be reversed by any physical strength or sly artifice.""Tensions in the region have grown as Kim Jong Un continues to show his nuclear capabilities and strengthens ties with Russia during President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine. Kim has not responded to calls from Seoul and Washington to restart denuclearization talks .North Korea has continued to pursue nuclear weapons, despite United Nations Security Council sanctions since it first carried out an underground nuclear test in 2006.It is believed North Korea now has a stockpile of nuclear weapons, although it has not carried out an atmospheric test.The United States and its Asian partners have long called for the complete removal of North Korea’s nuclear program, but analysts believe Pyongyang has moved past the point of accepting such a deal.US President Donald Trump has referred to North Korea as a ""nuclear power"" and said he is open to meeting Kim Jong Un again. During his first term, the two leaders met in several summits to try to reduce tensions.Kim is now focused on strengthening ties with Russia. North Korea has provided weapons and troops to support Russia’s war in Ukraine. Officials in Seoul are concerned that in return, Kim may receive economic help and advanced technology to improve North Korea’s military capabilities.","North Korea’s nuclear weapons status, along with its ""substantial and very strong nuclear deterrent,"" is a result of outside threats.

Judge restores AP's access to cover the White House

A federal judge in Washington, DC, on Tuesday directed the White House to end its restrictions against Associated Press (AP), restoring the news agency’s access to president Donald Trump's official events.The ban, which started on February 11, prevented AP journalists and photographers from entering the Oval Office and travelling on Air Force One. The action came after AP continued to use the name “Gulf of Mexico” instead of “Gulf of America,” a term introduced by Trump through an executive order earlier this year. Trump had also declared February 9 as the first “Gulf of America Day.”Judge Trevor McFadden said that the government could not deny access to some journalists based on their viewpoints. “If the government opens its doors to some journalists… it cannot shut those doors to others because of their viewpoints,” he said in his order.Associated Press had filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, claiming the restrictions violated the first amendment (freedom of the press) and the fifth amendment (due process). The lawsuit named three White House officials—Chief of staff Susie Wiles, press secretary Karoline Leavitt, and deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich.AP had issued a statement saying it would continue referring to the body of water as the “Gulf of Mexico” in line with its global editorial standards, while noting the White House’s preferred terminology. The agency said the name “Gulf of Mexico” is internationally recognised and important for clarity.","Judge restores AP's access to cover the White House.

What is Alien Enemies Act?



Salvadoran President confirmed the arrival of 'illegal aliens'



US President Donald Trump on Tuesday praised the Supreme Court for clearing the way for his administration to press ahead with immigration actions.The ruling included deporting alleged gang members under a wartime law dating back to 1798 called the "" Alien Enemies Act "".“Thanks to the Supreme Court yesterday and today, we had a big ruling, too,” Trump said. “We had a very big ruling today, but we will continue to deport these monsters under the Alien Enemies Act.”Taking to his Truth Social platform, Trump added: “Last month, we officially designated Tren de Aragua , MS-13 and the Mexican drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations—and thanks to the Supreme Court yesterday... we will continue to deport these monsters under the Alien Enemies Act.”Last month, Trump officials flew 250 accused gang members to El Salvador. Upon landing, the alleged criminals — including 238 members of Tren de Aragua and 23 MS-13 operatives — were met by heavily armed commandos, chained, and transferred to the infamous Terrorism Confinement Centre (CECOT).The Supreme Court delivered two major rulings this week that bolster Trump’s agenda to tighten the borders and reduce the size of the federal workforce. In one ruling on Monday, the justices overturned a lower court's decision that had blocked the removal of several men alleged to be gang members — including members of Venezuela’s feared Tren de Aragua group — without formal legal proceedings. The court said deportations under the Alien Enemies Act may continue, although detainees must still be given due process.The Alien Enemies Act, part of the Alien and Sedition Acts passed in 1798, allows the US government to detain and remove nationals from hostile nations during times of conflict. Trump invoked the act earlier this year to detain and deport suspected members of foreign criminal organisations, which he has since designated as “foreign terrorist organisations.”In a second win for Trump on Tuesday, the Supreme Court temporarily halted a lower court’s order that would have required federal agencies to reinstate about 16,000 workers the Trump administration had previously dismissed. This pause allows Trump to continue reshaping federal departments as part of his cost-cutting strategy.Trump also drew a contrast between his administration and that of Joe Biden, claiming that last year under Biden there were “more than 184,000 illegal aliens” in the country. “Under my administration, we released nine — all because of medical emergencies only,” he said.Last month, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele posted a video on his X account confirming the arrival of Tren de Aragua members after being deported from the US: ""Today, the first 238 members of the Venezuelan criminal organization, Tren de Aragua, arrived in our country. They were immediately transferred to CECOT, the Terrorism Confinement Center, for one year (renewable),” he wrote. “The United States will pay a very low fee for them, but a high one for us.”He also confirmed the arrival of 23 MS-13 members wanted in El Salvador, including two high-ranking leaders.Tren de Aragua, originally a prison gang in Venezuela, has gained ground in several US cities. In New York, the gang has been linked to retail theft, phone snatching, and peddling a synthetic drug known as Tusi.The Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 law that Trump invoked for deportations, allowed him to target gang members from Tren de Aragua. “They can be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies,” he said.",US President Donald Trump praised the Supreme Court for clearing the way for his administration to press ahead with immigration actions.

What is Elon Musk's take on tariff?



Elon Musk escalated his tariff war against the Donald Trump administration as he called Peter Navarro a 'moron' and 'dumber than a sack of bricks'. The jibe came after Navarro recently called Elon Musk a car assembler after Musk's reaction to reciprocal tariffs.But how did it all start? After Donald Trump announced the reciprocal tariffs, owing to which Elon Musk lost billions, Musk questioned Navarro's Harvard degree in a straight disapproval of the tariffs. Musk also said he would like a zero-tariff situation between the US and the EU. Navarro gave a measured reaction to Musk's attack and said his comments on tariffs were not surprising as he is a car assembler and relies on imports.""When it comes to tariffs and trade, we all understand in the White House - and the American people understand - that Elon is a car manufacturer, but he's not a car manufacturer. He's a car assembler,"" Navarro said, adding that many Tesla parts came from Japan, China and Taiwan. ""He's a car person. That's what he does, and he wants the cheap foreign parts.""""The difference is in our thinking and Elon's on this is that we want the tires made in Akron. We want the transmissions made in Indianapolis. We want the engines made in Flint and Saginaw, and we want the cars manufactured here,"" Navarro said.That was enough to infuriate Musk. ""By any definition whatsoever, Tesla is the most vertically integrated auto manufacturer in America with the highest percentage of US content. Navarro should ask the fake expert he invented, Ron Vara,"" Musk said. Ron Vara is an anagram of Navarro.""Tesla has the most American-made cars. Navarro is dumber than a sack of bricks,"" Musk said.Elon Musk hopes to see complete freedom of trade between the United States and Europe. ""At the end of the day, I hope it's agreed that both Europe and the United States should move ideally, in my view, to a zero tariff situation, effectively creating a free trade zone between Europe and North America,"" Musk said.",Elon Musk calls Trump tariff aide Peter Navarro moron in a major escalation in their war of words.

"Texas GOP civil war: Paxton enters Senate race, aiming to unseat longtime Texas rival",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/texas-gop-civil-war-paxton-enters-senate-race-aiming-to-unseat-longtime-texas-rival/articleshow/120112088.cms,"Ken Paxton (AP Photo)

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton officially declared his candidacy for the US Senate on Tuesday night during an appearance on The Ingraham Angle on Fox News, launching what is expected to be one of the most heated and expensive Republican primaries in recent Texas history.“It’s time for a change in Texas,” Paxton told host Laura Ingraham, making clear his intention to unseat incumbent Republican Senator John Cornyn . “It’s time that we have another great senator that will actually stand up and fight for Republican values, fight for the values of the people of Texas and also support Donald Trump in the areas that he's focused on in a very significant way.""Paxton’s announcement arrives shortly after federal prosecutors ended a long-running corruption probe into his activities, clearing a major cloud that had hung over his political future for years. The timing of his bid follows Cornyn’s formal launch of his re-election campaign two weeks ago, as the senior Texas senator seeks a fifth term in office.Tensions between the two Republicans have been simmering for years, with Paxton frequently branding Cornyn a “RINO,” or “Republican in name only,” and accusing him of being out of step with grassroots conservatives and insufficiently loyal to President Donald Trump.The intra-party fight has already turned bitter. Within hours of Paxton’s announcement, Cornyn’s campaign posted on X, formerly Twitter, slamming Paxton as a hypocrite. “Ken Paxton is a fraud,” the statement read. “He talks tough on crime and then lets crooked progressive Lina Hidalgo off the hook… uses fake Uber accounts to meet his girlfriend and deceive his family.”Cornyn allies also took aim at Paxton's legal controversies and alleged ethical lapses. Meanwhile, Paxton hit back by questioning Cornyn’s conservative credentials and slamming his past opposition to Trump during the 2016 election, as well as his role in crafting a bipartisan gun control bill in the wake of the 2022 Uvalde school shooting.Despite Cornyn’s longtime support for conservative policies — his campaign pointed out that he has voted with Trump more often than 95% of sitting senators — Paxton has positioned himself as the MAGA candidate, directly appealing to the populist base of the party.“This sets the table for the most expensive primary in Texas,” GOP strategist Dave Carney told Fox News. “It will be a brutal battle,” he added, noting that Paxton’s Senate bid will also create a wide-open contest for the now-vacant attorney general seat, with several candidates expected to jump in.Veteran Republican consultant Matt Mackowiak predicted a high-stakes, bare-knuckle fight between two deeply entrenched figures in Texas politics . “This is going to be the most expensive, nastiest, most aggressive, most personal US Senate primary in Texas history,” he said, adding that both sides “do not like each other, and the stakes could not be higher.”Paxton has not kept his Senate ambitions a secret. As early as September 2023, he criticized Cornyn in a Fox News interview, saying, “I can’t think of a single thing he’s accomplished for our state or even for the country,” and declaring, “somebody needs to step up and run against this guy.”He has also teased a potential campaign at GOP meetings and in January told Fox News Digital that he was “looking potentially at the US Senate.”Cornyn, 73, a fixture of Texas Republican politics since the early 2000s, has served as state attorney general, Texas Supreme Court justice, and US senator since 2002. Despite his credentials, many grassroots conservatives view him with suspicion — a dynamic Paxton is eager to capitalize on.As Paxton joins the fray, the stage is set for a no-holds-barred primary clash that could reshape the future of the Texas GOP — and determine which faction truly holds power within the party.","Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton officially declared his candidacy for the US Senate on Tuesday night.

Congo coup trio flown back to US to serve life sentences after death penalty lifted,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/congo-coup-trio-flown-back-to-us-to-serve-life-sentences-after-death-penalty-lifted/articleshow/120111598.cms,"AP photo

Three American citizens sentenced to death in the Democratic Republic of Congo for their roles in a failed coup attempt last year have been returned to the United States, where they will now serve life sentences. The transfer follows a decision by Congolese authorities to commute the men's death sentences just days ago.""The Americans left Tuesday morning,"" said Tina Salama, spokesperson for Congo’s presidency, adding that the repatriation was coordinated with the US Embassy. While the US State Department confirmed the transfer of custody, it referred further questions to the Department of Justice.Among those returned was Marcel Malanga, 21, the son of Christian Malanga, an opposition leader who authorities say led the attempted coup targeting the presidential palace in Kinshasa. The elder Malanga, who livestreamed the event, was killed while resisting arrest. His son has claimed he was coerced into joining the effort.Also repatriated were 21-year-old Tyler Thompson Jr., a friend of Marcel's who traveled from Utah under the impression that he was going on a vacation, and 36-year-old Benjamin Reuben Zalman-Polun , reportedly linked to Christian Malanga through a gold mining venture.Tyler’s stepmother, Miranda Thompson, expressed relief at his return. “We’re so excited to have him on American soil again,” she told the Associated Press, though she acknowledged the family did not have full details of the transfer. Thompson's attorney, Skye Lazaro, said she’s still unsure about what conditions her client will face now that he’s back in the US, but intends to explore all legal options available.Typically, when Americans convicted overseas are brought back under prisoner transfer agreements, they are expected to serve the sentence handed down abroad. International law expert Jared Genser noted that while legal arguments could be made that the Americans signed transfer documents under duress, “it would be very hard to prevail in such a case as there would be enormous implications for other potential transfers in the future if the US failed to abide by such agreements.”The three men had been imprisoned in Kinshasa under difficult conditions. Family members previously reported they were forced to sleep on the floor in a high-security military facility, often without access to basic necessities unless they paid for them.The Congolese presidency described the decision to transfer the prisoners as part of broader efforts to strengthen judicial collaboration and human rights cooperation with the United States. “This decision is part of a dynamic of strengthening judicial diplomacy and international cooperation in matters of justice and human rights between the two countries,” the office said in a statement.Their return comes at a time when Washington and Kinshasa are reportedly negotiating a significant minerals agreement. A senior adviser to US President Donald Trump confirmed last week that discussions are underway and hinted at potential “multibillion-dollar investments.” The United States has long viewed Congo as a strategic partner, given its vast untapped mineral wealth.Dozens of other individuals — mostly Congolese but also a Briton, a Belgian, and a Canadian — were also convicted over the attempted coup. Charges ranged from terrorism and murder to illegal possession of firearms. The current status of those convicted alongside the Americans remains uncertain.Congo reinstated capital punishment last year after more than two decades of moratorium, citing the rising threat of violence and militant attacks in the country’s volatile eastern provinces.",Three American citizens sentenced to death in the Democratic Republic of Congo for their roles in a failed coup attempt last year have been returned to the United States.

He is nonverbal, has autism, and suffers from cerebral palsy. He was also intellectually disabled, according to his family.His aunt, Ana Vazquez, confirmed that he remains in critical condition after undergoing surgeries to remove nine bullets and amputate one of his legs. “We don’t know if he’s going to wake up,” she said.A witness video shows police officers opening fire just 12 seconds after stepping out of their vehicles. The officers had responded to a 911 call reporting a person with a knife in a backyard. The caller, the neighbour’s son, said the teen appeared drunk and was chasing two people. His family later clarified Victor was not intoxicated but had difficulty walking due to his condition.Victor reportedly got up from the ground and moved towards the officers while holding a knife following which they shot him multiple times. His sister, who was present, reportedly screamed that he was “special,” trying to stop the shooting.The police chief acknowledged the video but said it shows only one angle. He defended the officers’ actions, saying they had to react to a threat.Protests have erupted in Pocatello, with many questioning why officers did not use Tasers or pepper spray instead of opening fire.

President Donald J. Trump Plants a New MAGAnolia Sapling 🇺🇸

US president Donald Trump on Tuesday planted a new magnolia tree at the White House , replacing the historic Jackson Magnolia that was recently taken down due to safety risks.Trump shared the news on his social media platform, adding, “We have a beautiful tree now at the White House.”The media was not allowed to cover the event, but a short video was later posted online showing Trump and longtime grounds superintendent Dale Haney shovelling dirt. “Dale’s been here 53 years. He’s fantastic,” Trump said.The original southern magnolia had stood near the South Portico of the White House for almost two centuries. It was often seen during official events and visits from world leaders, reported Associated Press. Trump had announced on March 30 that the tree was in “terrible condition” and posed a safety hazard.The National Park Service said that, according to folklore, president Andrew Jackson brought the seeds of the tree from his home near Nashville, Tennessee. They were reportedly planted in memory of his wife, Rachel, who passed away just before he became president in 1829.It further confirmed that the new 12-year-old sapling planted in its place is a direct descendant of the original Jackson Magnolia.

Cornell in the crosshairs: Trump freezes $1 billion over campus antisemitism probe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cornell-in-the-crosshairs-trump-freezes-1-billion-over-campus-antisemitism-probe/articleshow/120109893.cms,"Cornell University (NYT photo)

In a sweeping move aimed at enforcing anti-discrimination laws on college campuses, the Trump administration has frozen over $1 billion in federal funding to Cornell University and $790 million to Northwestern University, citing ongoing civil rights investigations.“The money was frozen in connection with several ongoing, credible, and concerning Title VI investigations,” a Trump administration official told Fox News. The halted funds reportedly involve grants and contracts from several federal departments, including Agriculture, Defense, Education, and Health and Human Services, according to two officials who spoke with the New York Times.This action is part of a broader federal initiative targeting elite universities over what the administration describes as noncompliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, particularly in regard to antisemitism. The administration has taken similar steps against other prominent institutions in recent months.Harvard University is also under federal scrutiny. The Trump administration has launched a comprehensive review of $9 billion in grants and contracts awarded to the Ivy League school. This includes $255.6 million in current federal contracts between Harvard, its affiliates, and the government, along with $8.7 billion in long-term grant agreements, according to a Reuters report.""Harvard's failure to protect students on campus from antisemitic discrimination — all while promoting divisive ideologies over free inquiry — has put its reputation in serious jeopardy,"" Secretary of Education Linda McMahon told Reuters. ""Harvard can right these wrongs and restore itself to a campus dedicated to academic excellence and truth-seeking, where all students feel safe on its campus.""The moves come on the heels of a high-profile case involving Columbia University, which saw $400 million in federal funding withdrawn after the administration’s task force found the school had not sufficiently addressed antisemitism on campus. Columbia eventually agreed to several policy changes in response to the ultimatum, but reactions were split. While some Jewish organizations welcomed the shift, critics argued the federal action set a dangerous precedent that could chill academic freedom and free expression.The investigations reflect a broader campaign by the Trump administration to tie federal funding to strict enforcement of civil rights protections, particularly regarding campus climates and antisemitism. As scrutiny intensifies, institutions across the country are bracing for what could be a major redefinition of the boundaries between government oversight and academic independence.","The Trump administration has frozen over $1 billion in federal funding to Cornell University and $790 million to Northwestern University, citing ongoing civil rights investigations.

Pentagon says US will help Panama take back canal from Chinese influence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pentagon-says-us-will-help-panama-take-back-canal-from-chinese-influence/articleshow/120109732.cms,"Pete Hegseth

US defense secretary Pete Hegseth pledged on Tuesday that the United States would work with Panama to reduce China's influence over the Panama Canal . His remarks came during a rare visit to the country as he stood at a US-funded pier in Panama City.""Together, we will take back the Panama Canal from China's influence,"" Hegseth told news agency Reuters. ""China did not build this canal. China does not operate this canal and China will not weaponize this canal. Together with Panama in the lead, we will keep the canal secure and available for all nations.""Hegseth is the first US defense secretary to visit Panama in decades. His trip comes amid growing American concerns about Chinese commercial projects in the region, including plans by Chinese companies to build a bridge over the canal. More than 40% of US container traffic—worth roughly $270 billion annually—passes through the canal, which is vital for global trade and potential US military operations.While Hegseth emphasized partnership with Panama, former President Donald Trump has gone further, even suggesting military force to ""reclaim"" the canal. Trump has falsely claimed that China operates the canal and has soldiers present—allegations Hegseth himself dismissed.Former US Ambassador to Panama John Feeley also criticized Trump's approach, saying, ""What's not legitimate about the way Trump has gone about this is the bullying tactic that he's used, which is to claim that there has been a violation of the neutrality treaty. There hasn't been.""President Jose Raul Mulino, who met privately with Hegseth, has been aligned with the US on several fronts. In February, he pulled Panama out of China's Belt and Road Initiative and has supported US immigration enforcement by accepting deportation flights and working to reduce migrant flows through the Darien jungle.""Panama is, and will continue to be, Panamanian,"" Mulino said, defending his country's stewardship of the canal.Hegseth, a military veteran and former Fox News host, praised Mulino’s stance, calling him a partner who “understood the threat from China.” His visit follows a US-led deal in which BlackRock acquired major port operations from Hong Kong’s CK Hutchison, a move Trump hailed as an effort to “reclaim” the canal.Analysts say Panama’s cooperation is key. “On the whole, this hasn't been a winning issue for the United States in terms of public diplomacy in Panama,” said Ryan Berg of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. But with Mulino in office, Washington may have found an ally.","Pete Hegseth is the first US defense secretary to visit Panama in decades.

ISLAMABAD: A tense standoff unfolded across Balochistan on Monday as a shutter-down strike and widespread road blockades sparked by nationalist leader Sardar Akhtar Mengal ’s call for a “long march” from Lakpass to Quetta paralysed the Pakistani province.The protest by Akhtar’s Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), now in its second week, demands the release of detained Baloch activists, including women leaders of Balochistan Yakjehti Committee (BYC), amid escalating clashes with authorities.Shops businesses and schools remained closed in cities like Quetta, Kalat, Mastung Khuzdar, and Gwadar. Mengal’s supporters blocked key highways, including the Quetta-Karachi national highway.The provincial govt’s deployment of containers, trenches, and police checkpoints at Lakpass, roughly 30 km from Quetta, stalled the march, forcing demonstrators onto rugged mountain routes.Reports of police using teargas and shelling BNP-M workers have intensified the unrest.Mengal, addressing a sit-in at Lakpass, accused the state of oppression and vowed to press forward. “The state may crush us, but we won’t bow,” he declared, signalling plans to escalate the march into province-wide resistance. The protest began March 28 in Wadh, Mengal’s hometown, following the arrest of BYC leaders, including Mahrang Baloch, during a crackdown on their Quetta sit-in. A suicide bombing near the rally on March 29 left Mengal unharmed but underscored the volatile stakes.Balochistan’s govt, led by chief minister Sarfraz Bugti, has taken a hard line. His spokesperson, Shahid Rind, warned Mengal of arrest under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) Act if the march entered Quetta’s Red Zone.Negotiations have faltered, with Mengal dismissing the provincial govt’s delegations as powerless to meet demands. BYC, however, rallied behind Mengal, urging highway blockades and strikes to amplify pressure.Analysts see it as a critical juncture for Balochistan, where grievances over state repression, enforced disappearances and resource exploitation fuel dissent. The shutter-down has disrupted public life, with Quetta’s land links to 12 districts severed for over a week. With cellular networks down and security tightened, the province braces for what Mengal’s supporters call a defining fight.",The protest by Akhtar’s Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) demands the release of detained Baloch activists.

Who are the militant groups?



Poll Do you believe the rise in militant attacks in Pakistan is primarily due to the influence of groups based in Afghanistan? No, not at all Yes, definitely

Which are the most affected regions?



What are the consequences of the rising violence?



More than 100 deadly attacks in Pakistan by Islamist militants and separatist rebels made March the deadliest month over a decade with 335 people killed, a think tank reported Thursday.Of the deaths, 228 were caused by militant groups, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) think tank. They included 73 members of security services, including soldiers and police officers, 67 civilians and 88 militants.The Islamist-militant Pakistani Taliban, or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and the separatist rebel Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) were the main militant groups responsible for the attacks.The BLA was responsible for a 28-hour hijacking of the train Jaffar Express in the southwestern region Balochistan. Some 450 people were held hostage and more than two dozen were killed.Balochistan was the most affected province, followed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the northwest of Pakistan.They have both also been targets of suicide bombings, a form of attacks that surged in March.In Punjab, the eastern province bordering India, the think tank observed a strong increase in militant activity.At least seven attacks were recorded, and most were attributed to the TTP.In response to the growing threat, Pakistan's security forces have intensified their operations in the region. Many people have been arrested with connections to militant groups, including the TTP.Islamabad claims that most attacks, both by militants and rebels, are planned and executed from Afghanistan. It accuses the neighboring country of granting Pakistani militants space to plan and organize attacks.A recent report by the United Nations supported this claim. It said that the Taliban provided support to the TTP and that some attacks were launched from Afghan territory.As a consequence, the Pakistani government has urged the ruling Taliban in Afghanistan to act against the allegedly responsible criminals. Kabul, on the other hand, denies that the militants are in Afghanistan.","Of the deaths, 228 were caused by militant groups, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.

He maintains his innocence, asserting that the charges are politically driven.","Imran Khan has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for his contributions to human rights and democratic values.

He admitted that unarmed civilians were present at the site.""The safety of civilians is always a top priority during such operations. However, due to complex geography, terrorists using civilian populations as cover, and the urgent nature of the operation, unintended consequences can sometimes occur,"" said Saif, as quoted by the Associated Press.The provincial government has now promised an inquiry into how the operation led to civilian deaths.Local residents reported that the victims were nomads from the Swat region who had been living in the Shamozai mountains with their livestock. Their families protested by placing their bodies on the Swat Highway, demanding justice.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur called the incident “highly condemnable and tragic.” He assured that every effort is made to avoid civilian casualties but acknowledged the challenges of military operations in complex terrains where militants embed themselves among civilians.The government said medical aid is being provided to the injured, and compensation for the victims' families is being arranged.

Mass protests in Bangladesh against Israeli attacks on Gaza,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/mass-protests-in-bangladesh-against-israeli-attacks-on-gaza/articleshow/120067714.cms,"Protest in Bangladesh over Israel attacks in Gaza. (AP)

Demonstrations broke out across Bangladesh, including Dhaka city, on Monday protesting against Israeli actions in Gaza. Different organisations spanning political, social, cultural, religious and professional spheres took to Dhaka's streets in protest.The demonstrations form part of worldwide protests against attacks on Palestinians in Gaza, according to organisers. Students have stayed away from classes and examinations to join the protests.Muhammad Yunus, chief advisor of interim government in Bangladesh, said in a statement on X, ""The Government of Bangladesh expresses its strongest condemnation of the Israeli Occupying Forces’ continued mass killing and gross violations of human rights in the Gaza Strip. Israel’s ongoing military attacks since last month's unilateral breach of the ceasefire have killed scores of Palestinians, mostly women and children as well as blocked the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza leading to a human catastrophe. Evidently, Israel has shown no regard to repeated international appeals and has instead engaged in an increasingly intense killing spree.""Workers and professionals went on strike with organisers asking people to stop buying Israeli products.""We support humanity first of all. The things that Israel has been doing to Palestine to remove their identity from the world are brutally bad. As a human, if I don't support Palestine right now, my humanity will be lost,"" stated a Dhaka University student participant.Protesters voiced strong opposition to American support for Israel's Gaza offensive, whilst criticising the inaction of bodies like the UN, OIC and Arab League.Responding about American involvement, she said, ""They have been doing this for power, nothing else. If they had humanity in their hearts, they would not be doing this to the people right now. We are demanding to stop the genocide and to stop the killing of people.""Palestinian flags, solidarity placards, and setting fire to Netanyahu's effigy were all part of the Bangladeshi protest.The USA faces criticism over Trump's suggested forced Palestinian relocation for Gaza's reconstruction. Arab countries reject this plan, whilst human rights groups term it ethnic cleansing. Protesters also opposed American suppression of pro-Palestinian activities at universities, Al Jazeera reports.57 people died and 137 were wounded in the past 24 hours, according to Gaza authorities. Since March 18, Israeli attacks have caused 1,391 deaths and 3,434 injuries. Total casualties since October 7, 2023, have reached 50,752 and 115,475 injuries, according to Al Jazeera.","Demonstrations broke out across Bangladesh, including Dhaka city, on Monday protesting against Israeli actions in Gaza.

Man who fought with Maoists to end monarchy is now commander of people who want it back,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/man-who-fought-with-maoists-to-end-monarchy-is-now-commander-of-people-who-want-it-back/articleshow/120066259.cms,"Durga Prasai, the healthcare baron.

Durga Prasai was once a Maoist ally.

KATHMANDU: The man who once smuggled armed Maoists in milk vans through Nepal’s eastern flatlands is now a fugitive “hiding in India” — his black SUV abandoned in a village ditch just 20-odd km from the border. Durga Prasai , the healthcare baron who financed rebels and established hospitals, is now broadcasting his fury from hiding, his voice ringing through TikTok videos, Instagram reels, and bootleg YouTube clips.Two decades ago, he backed a 10-year civil war that killed over 17,000 people and helped bring down the crown. Today, he’s the loudest voice calling for its return. Last month, a coalition of pro-royalist groups declared him their 'People’s Commander' — a symbolic title that capped his rapid rise from political outsider to the most visible face of Nepal’s monarchy revival. Overnight, the Maoist-turned-royalist became the de facto leader of a movement that had long lacked coherence or momentum.Born into a farming family in Terhathum in 1971, his family later migrated to Jhapa. He dropped out after Class 8 due to financial constraints. A failed buffalo-farming venture and mounting debt nudged him into politics. Initially aligning with the Nepali Congress , he later went underground with the Maoists. During the war, he provided refuge and logistics to fighters, becoming a trusted link between revolution and resources. His ties to Maoist supremo Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ deepened, and by 2017, he was influential enough to host a dinner with both Prachanda and PM K P Sharma Oli — helping unify warring factions.Then came the rupture. After being denied a parliamentary ticket and seeing his private medical college, B&C Medical College, embroiled in controversies, Prasai broke with the ruling UML. In 2022, he was expelled from the party. By early 2023, he was publicly denouncing secularism and federalism. The man who once worked to end the monarchy began to call for its restoration.“Prachanda betrayed the people, the revolution, and everything we fought for,” Prasai said recently. “He used the blood of thousands to build a personal empire. He’s the reason the country is where it is today — divided, looted, and leaderless. The politicians are corrupt. The king never looted the country. We want him back.”On March 28, he took that message to the streets. Under the banner of his ‘People’s Movement for Nation, Nationality, Religion and Culture’, Prasai led a massive pro-monarchy rally in central Kathmandu.What started as a peaceful protest devolved into chaos. Videos show Prasai’s SUV breaking through police barricades. Protesters clashed violently with security forces. Two people died. Govt offices were ransacked.By the next morning, Prasai had vanished.On Friday, his SUV was found abandoned in Jhapa, 35km by road from Panitanki, an Indian border town on Nepal’s east. Police suspect he switched vehicles and crossed into India. “He is either in the Tarai or in Indian territory,” a senior police official told myRepublica. “We’re monitoring all points.”But from hiding, Prasai has kept talking. In one video, standing beside a temple, he says: “Even a lion takes a step back before hunting — and then it pounces.” In another: “I am still in Nepal. I have no enmity with the police. I stepped back not out of fear, but to prepare for the next move.” Addressing the events at the March 28 protest, he said: “I broke through the security barricade for my own safety. It was not an act of hostility toward the police. I apologise for any harm caused to you.”He also claimed that snipers had been positioned to assassinate him. “This was not an ordinary operation,” he said. “After hearing that the PM has ordered to shoot me on sight, I took shelter in a safe place.” On Facebook, he dared the authorities: “If you have the courage, arrest me and King Gyanendra within 24 hours. Let’s see who the people stand with.”While Prasai presents himself as a moral insurgent, critics point to a chequered past. In Dec 2024, his case was transferred to the Central Investigation Bureau of Nepal Police for allegedly paying Rs 500,000 to hire criminal associates to issue threats to business rivals. The threats, investigators say, were made in the name of notorious Indian gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, who remains incarcerated at Sabarmati Central Jail in Gujarat. Prasai denied any involvement, claiming the charges were politically motivated.Regardless, his influence has only grown. He has overshadowed traditional monarchist leaders, including those from the Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP), spearheading the protests for years. Thousands now rally behind him, waving flags and amplifying his speeches on social media.Prachanda, leader of the opposition, has warned in parliament that the republic’s democratic gains are “under coordinated attack.” Oli — who replaced him as PM in July 2024 — has also distanced himself from his former ally. Dozens of Prasai’s aides have been arrested since the March 28 protest. A red-corner notice for his arrest is in preparation and there are rumours that he will be charged with sedition.Yet among many frustrated Nepalis, Prasai’s message lands hard. Fourteen govts in 17 years, rising prices, youth emigration, a failing healthcare system — all have left the republic discredited in the eyes of millions. Whether Prasai can ride that sentiment into real political change remains uncertain.","Durga Prasai once smuggled armed Maoists in milk vans through Nepal’s eastern flatlands.
