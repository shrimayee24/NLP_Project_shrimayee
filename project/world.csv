India-Afghanistan Dialogue Highlights Pahalgam Attack, Cross-Border Terror And Pakistan Threats

NEW DELHI: A press conference by Afghan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in New Delhi on Friday drew attention not for what was said, but for who wasn’t in the room. Women journalists were not allowed to attend the event, which was restricted to a handful of male reporters.The interaction, held at the Afghan Embassy just hours after Muttaqi’s talks with external affairs minister S Jaishankar , appeared to mirror the gender restrictions long criticised under the Taliban regime.According to people familiar with the matter, the decision on which journalists would be invited was made by Taliban officials accompanying Muttaqi.The Indian side, news agency PTI reported, had suggested that women reporters should also be included among the invitees, a recommendation that was evidently not accepted.Former Union home minister P Chidambaram expressed shock over the incident, saying ""men journalists should have walked out when they found that their women colleagues were excluded"".""I am shocked that women journalists were excluded from the press conference addressed by Mr Amir Khan Muttaqi of Afghanistan In my personal view, the men journalists should have walked out when they found that their women colleagues were excluded (or not invited),"" Chidambaram wrote on X.Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Lok Sabha MP from Wayanad, sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi's position on the issue and said his ""recognition of women’s rights isn’t just convenient posturing from one election to the other"".""Prime Minister @narendramodi ji, please clarify your position on the removal of female journalists from the press conference of the representative of the Taliban on his visit to India. If your recognition of women’s rights isn’t just convenient posturing from one election to the other, then how has this insult to some of India’s most competent women been allowed in our country, a country whose women are its backbone and its pride,"" Priyanka Gandhi Vadra wrote on X.TMC MP Mahua Moitra said: ""Govt has dishonoured every single Indian woman by allowing Taliban minister to exclude women journalists from presser. Shameful bunch of spineless hypocrites.""The Taliban government in Kabul has faced sustained global condemnation, including from the United Nations , for its curbs on women’s rights, education, and participation in public life.When asked about the condition of women in Afghanistan, Muttaqi sidestepped the question. Instead, he maintained that each country had its own systems and values that should be respected.“Every country has its own customs, laws and principles, and there should be respect for them,” he said.Muttaqi claimed that Afghanistan’s situation had improved since the Taliban takeover in August 2021, contrasting current conditions with the years before.“Some 200 to 400 people died in Afghanistan every day before Taliban started ruling the country,” he said.“In these four years, there have been no such losses. Laws are in force and every one has their rights. Those who are engaging in propaganda are making a mistake,” Muttaqi claimed.Defending his government’s record, he added: ""Every country has its own customs, laws and principles, and works according to those. It is not correct that people are not given their rights. If people were not happy with the system and the laws, why has peace returned?""Even as Muttaqi painted a picture of stability, the absence of women journalists at his own press conference put in light the very issue that continues to define Afghanistan’s global image, a peace built without the voices of half its population.","Women journalists were not allowed to attend the event, which was restricted to a handful of male reporters.

'Let Them Decide': Trump At Oval Office When Asked About NOBEL PRIZE After Gaza Deal

Will Trump get the Peace Prize?



Also read:

Who are the contenders?







The Norwegian Nobel Committee will announce the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday. The award is considered one of the most anticipated and unpredictable honours.Experts say the committee usually focuses on lasting peace, international cooperation, and the work of institutions that promote these goals.The announcement will be made in Oslo, Norway, where the committee will name the laureate who reflects the values of Alfred Nobel, the 19th-century Swedish industrialist who founded the prize.There has been speculation about the possibility of US President Donald Trump winning the prize, a discussion partly driven by Trump himself. However, experts who follow the Nobel process say his chances are low despite his involvement in several international peace efforts.The announcement comes just hours after Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire and hostage release deal that could help end the two-year conflict in Gaza.While Trump has claimed credit for pressuring both sides to reach the deal, the timing makes it unlikely that the Nobel Committee considered it.The five-member committee held its final meeting on Monday, when it completed the statement explaining its choice, which is usually decided days in advance.""The Gaza deal has absolutely no significance for the choice of the 2025 laureate because the Nobel Committee has already made its decision,"" historian and Peace Prize expert Asle Sveen told news agency AFP.""Trump will not win the prize this year. I’m 100 percent certain,"" he said.A total of 338 individuals and organisations have been nominated for the 2025 Peace Prize, but the list remains secret for 50 years. With no clear favourite, several possible names are being discussed in Oslo.Among them are Sudan’s Emergency Response Rooms, a network of volunteers helping civilians during war and famine; Yulia Navalnaya, widow of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny; and the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, which monitors elections.The committee could also choose a laureate that signals its position on global issues, even if it invites criticism from the United States.Possible choices include UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres , the UN refugee agency (UNHCR), the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), or international courts such as the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the International Criminal Court (ICC).Organisations defending press freedom, such as the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) or Reporters Without Borders (RSF), are also being discussed as potential winners.Last year’s prize went to Nihon Hidankyo, an organisation of survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings that campaigns against nuclear weapons.The Nobel Peace Prize includes a diploma, a gold medal, and a $1.2 million cash award.The economics prize, to be announced on Monday, will conclude the 2025 Nobel season, which has already seen awards for medicine, physics, chemistry, literature, and peace.","The Norwegian Nobel Committee will announce the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday.

We see what is happening now, based on information and media reports and the final decisions, we sincerely hope that these initiatives of the US President will indeed be implemented in practice,"" he added.Meanwhile, Zelenskyy also welcomed Trump's efforts toward establishing lasting peace in the Middle East, calling it a crucial development not only for the region but for global stability.In a post on X, Zelenskyy said, ""It is important that the prospect of establishing lasting peace in the Middle East is drawing closer to being realised.This matters not only for that one region, but for the whole world. An agreement is moving forward that could help everyone.""Zelenskyy also voiced hope for the release of hostages and an end to civilian suffering in Gaza. ""We hope that the Israeli hostages, held for more than two years, will be released, and there will be no more victims in Gaza,"" he said.Drawing a parallel to Ukraine's own struggle, the President added, ""And we hope that global efforts will likewise be sufficient to achieve real peace for our country, in our region."" Condemning ongoing aggression by Moscow, Zelenskyy said, ""Russia remains the largest source of war and terror in the world today, and we expect just and firm international pressure on this aggressor to bring about lasting peace and guaranteed security. ""This comes after Hamas announced that it has reached a hostage-ceasefire agreement with Israel during indirect talks in Egypt, saying the exchange of hostages and Palestinian prisoners would take place within 72 hours of the deal’s implementation.The group confirmed that, as part of the first phase of a deal to end the war in Gaza, it will exchange 20 surviving hostages for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisonersHamas said the deal “provides for an end to the war in Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli forces, the entry of humanitarian aid, and a prisoner exchange.”Hamas also thanked the mediators and US President Donald Trump for brokering an end to the conflict with Israel, while urging them “to compel the occupation government to fully implement the obligations of the agreement and to prevent it from evading or delaying the implementation of what has been agreed upon.”Earlier, Trump gave Hamas a deadline of October 5 to agree to the deal or face ""all hell.""

SC questions TN on nod to Vijay’s party to hold Karur rally

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday questioned the manner in which a single judge of the Madras High Court - principal bench in Chennai - passed an order for a probe by an SIT into Karur stampede, when the petition it was responding to was for framing a standard operating protocol for political rallies.There is also fallacy in the order as the division bench of the high court at Madurai was examining the issue, it said.A bench of Justices J K Maheshwari and N V Anjaria asked why the principal bench entertained the petition related to the incident in Karur which falls within the jurisdiction of the Madurai bench. The court highlighted the procedural fault before going ahead with the hearing on a batch of petitions, including one filed by Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK), on the stampede during TVK leader Vijay 's rally that killed 41 people.SC also questioned Tamil Nadu for allowing TVK to hold the rally in Karur when AIADMK was denied permission to hold one there. It also asked how the postmortem of victims of the Karur stampede was conducted at midnight and completed within four hours. The state govt has been directed to respond to the court's queries.Senior advocate Gopal Subramanium, appearing for TVK, submitted that the petition filed before the HC was for a limited purpose - to frame SOP for political rallies - but SIT was constituted by the court on the first day of hearing itself.He also said many adverse observations were passed against Vijay which were factually wrong.Subramanium said while the actor was forced by state police to leave the spot, the HC had wrongly said he absconded and abandoned his fans.Expressing apprehension that the SIT, composing of state officials, would not conduct a fair probe in the case, TVK submitted that the investigation must be conducted under the supervision of a retired SC judge. Its plea was, however, strongly objected by senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi, AM Singhvi and P Wilson who submitted that it was not the state but the HC which had suggested the composition of the SIT. They said that the state govt has no axe to grind against anyone and it was not proper to question the impartiality of the SIT probe. The state also opposed a CBI probe in the case and told the bench that bringing the central agency to investigate the matter would undermine the federal structure.Responding to the court's observation about the speedy conduct of postmortems, Wilson said this was an incident of tragedy and there was a lot of hue and cry because families started demanding the dead bodies and 606 doctors and nurses were mobilised on that fateful day.",Supreme Court questions the manner in which a single judge of the Madras High Court passed an order for a probe by an SIT into Karur stampede.

US President Donald Trump said that Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado received her Nobel Peace Prize in his honour and that he has been “helping her along the way.”Trump, speaking during a briefing on Saturday, said, “The person who got the Nobel Prize called me today and said, 'I'm accepting this in honour of you because you really deserved it'. .. I didn't say, 'Give it to me', though. I think she might have... I've been helping her along the way...

The Nobel Committee cited her “tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy.”Trump had actively campaigned for the prize over the past year, calling himself the “president of peace” and repeatedly claiming to have “ended six or seven wars.” In September, he told UN delegates that his “peace record” was unmatched, citing conflicts between Israel and Iran, India and Pakistan, and “even Thailand and Cambodia.”The award represents a personal blow to Trump, who has said he “should have gotten [the prize] four or five times” and that “everyone says” he deserves it. It is also a diplomatic setback for Pakistan, one of the countries that formally nominated Trump, portraying him as a “champion of peace.”","The 2025 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Machado for her efforts to promote democratic rights and achieve a peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy.

Rapid health decline and fatal complications following cosmetic procedure



Legal battle and allegations raise concerns over cosmetic procedure oversight







Brazilian social media influencer Adair Mendes Dutra Junior, widely known as Junior Dutra, has died at the age of 31 following severe, unexpected complications from a cosmetic procedure. Known for his vibrant social media presence, creative lifestyle content, and engaging personality, Junior had gained a large, loyal following on Instagram. His untimely death has sent shockwaves through the Brazilian beauty community, social media circles, and among his over 100,000 devoted followers, many of whom expressed grief, disbelief, and heartbreak across multiple platforms.The tragedy unfolded after he underwent a popular cosmetic procedure called the “fox eyes” surgery, which aims to lift, reshape, and elongate the outer corners of the eyes for a more striking, model-like appearance. What was intended as a simple beauty enhancement turned fatal, tragically highlighting the potential risks, hidden dangers, and lack of regulation surrounding trendy cosmetic procedures increasingly sought after by influencers worldwide.Junior Dutra reportedly underwent the fox eyes procedure in March, performed by celebrity dentist Fernando Simionato Garbi. The influencer had publicly shared videos documenting the procedure, later revealing significant swelling, bruising, and redness around his eyes.Following the treatment, Junior developed a serious infection, which persisted despite dermatological care. In an interview with Brazilian outlet Feed TV, just a month before his death, he shared his deteriorating health: “I didn’t expect it to get this bad.” He described frequent hospital visits as he struggled to recover from post-procedure complications.This situation underscores a critical point: even procedures that appear minimally invasive or cosmetic can carry severe health risks if complications arise.The fox eyes or cat eyes surgery has surged in popularity in recent years, inspired by celebrities like Bella Hadid and Kendall Jenner. The procedure is designed to create an almond-shaped, lifted eye by raising the outer corners, giving a youthful and striking appearance.According to the American Board of Cosmetic Surgery (ABCS), several methods can achieve this look, including:Despite their popularity, these treatments are not risk-free. The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) warns that complications can include:The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also cautioned against the use of PDO threads for eyebrow or eyelid lifts, noting potential for permanent disfigurement, severe swelling, and long-lasting pain.Medical experts emphasise the importance of monitoring for early warning signs of complications. Post-procedure symptoms that should not be ignored include:To minimise risks, specialists recommend:Junior Dutra’s health reportedly worsened rapidly in his final days. His close friend Gean Souza told Brazilian magazine Quem that he began experiencing shortness of breath and extreme weakness. As reported by The US Sun, on October 3, Junior was rushed to a public hospital in São Paulo after severe respiratory distress. Despite emergency care, he could not be saved. His sudden passing left fans and the online beauty community in shock, illustrating how quickly post-procedure complications can escalate.Adding further complexity to the tragedy, Junior had filed a police complaint prior to his death. Legal documents obtained by Brazilian outlet Portland Leo Dias reveal that Junior accused Garbi of performing medical procedures outside his professional license and impersonating a doctor. The complaint included charges of illegal medical practice, fraud, and causing serious bodily harm. Junior had also requested an official investigation by the 15th Police District of São Paulo.Garbi, through legal representatives, denied any wrongdoing and maintained that his procedures were performed legally and safely under proper supervision. The case highlights the need for stronger regulatory oversight in cosmetic procedures, particularly those fueled by social media trends.","Brazilian social media influencer Adair Mendes Dutra Junior, widely known as Junior Dutra, has died at the age of 31 following severe, unexpected complications from a cosmetic procedure.

Trump ‘SULKS’ As Venezuela’s Machado Bags Peace Prize | Iron Lady Who Even Maduro Couldn't Break





US President Donald Trump’s MAGA minions went into major meltdown on Friday after the Norwegian Nobel Committee snubbed him by awarding the 2025 Peace Prize to Venezuelan democracy activist Maria Corina Machado.Trump himself offered no reaction – not even a congratulatory message to the winner — after having campaigned fervidly for the award saying it would be an insult to the US if he did not get the prize for purportedly resolving seven conflicts across the world. But MAGA megaphones, including White House officials, vent their fury at the rebuff even as the Norwegian government bunkered down for the blowback.“The Nobel Committee proved they place politics over peace.” White House communications chief Steven Cheung said soon after the winner was announced. “Imagine thinking a woman who cries nonstop about Nicolas Maduro has done more for the world than President Trump. What an absolute joke,” MAGA gadabout Laura Loomer chimed in, calling the award for Machado “more affirmative action nonsense.”While announcing the Prize for Machado, the Nobel committee left no doubt that she was a more deserving candidate, implicitly expressing skepticism about Trump’s incessant bragging about having worked for peace amid his own record at home where he has begun militarising cities and persecuting critics.The committee said Machado, 58, is receiving the Prize first and foremost for her efforts to advance democracy in Venezuela at a time democracy is also in retreat internationally. Calling her a “brave and committed champion of peace who keeps the flame of democracy burning amid a growing darkness,” the committee later said in a post on X that it wanted to send a message to all authoritarian leaders: “choose ballots, not bullets. ”Asked directly after the announcement about Trump’s campaigning for the prize, Jørgen Watne Frydnes, Chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, acknowledged the lobbying but cryptically noted, “This committee sits in a room full of portraits of all laureates, filled with courage and integrity.”Some commentators in the US noted that he could have simply said most nominations for Trump were received after the January 31 deadline but he chose not to and instead implicitly criticised the US president.Trump critics and supporters both viewed several other remarks and posts by the committee as trolling, driving MAGA partisans to rage. “I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. The Noble Peace Prize is a participation trophy,” one MAGA commentator fumed, misspelling Nobel. Many of them are incensed that Democrat leaders, including Barack Obama, Al Gore, and Jimmy Carter, have won the prize but Republicans have been denied. They believe that Trump truly deserved the prize, particularly in the context of the truce he has effected in Gaza.White House comms chief Steven Cheung, known for his vituperative smackdowns of Trump critics, said the president will “continue making peace deals, ending wars, and saving lives.” “He has the heart of a humanitarian, and there will never be anyone like him who can move mountains with the sheer force of his will,” Cheung said, even as Trump was scheduled for a health check before heading out to the Middle East to preside over the peace deal he had hoped would fetch him the Nobel.Meanwhile, international observers and the global media expressed fears for Norway from a vindictive US president. Norway’s trade minister Cecilie Myrseth is expected in Washington DC this week to negotiate on tariffs amid concerns over the country’s $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund—the world’s biggest— about half of which is tied up in the US markets.","US President Donald Trump’s MAGA minions went into major meltdown on Friday after the Norwegian Nobel Committee snubbed him by awarding the 2025 Peace Prize to Venezuelan democracy activist Maria Corina Machado. “Imagine thinking a woman who cries nonstop about Nicolas Maduro has done more for the world than President Trump.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday that Russia would not worry if the United States decides not to extend the New START treaty, which limits nuclear warheads and expires next year.The New START treaty, signed in 2010 between the United States and Russia, limits each side to 1,550 deployed strategic nuclear warheads and 700 delivery systems, including missiles and bombers. It also allows mutual inspections and data exchanges to ensure compliance and maintain transparency in nuclear arms control.Putin said that it would be a “shame” if nothing remained of the long-standing arms control framework between the two powers, reports new agency Reuters.Speaking to reporters at a summit in Tajikistan, Putin said that an arms race was already underway and confirmed that Russia was continuing to develop and test new-generation nuclear weapons. “Will these few months be enough to make a decision on an extension? I think it will be enough if there is goodwill to extend these agreements. And if the Americans decide they don't need it, that's not a big deal for us,” he said.The Russian leader noted that Moscow was ready to voluntarily keep the limits defined under the New START treaty if Washington agreed to do the same. The START agreement is due to expire in February.The United States has yet to formally respond to Russia’s offer.“We're ready to negotiate if it's acceptable and useful for the Americans. If not, then no, but that would be a shame, because then there would be nothing left in terms of deterrence in the area of strategic offensive weapons,” Putin said.Without naming, Putin also warned that other countries might be preparing to carry out nuclear tests. “So some countries are thinking about it; as far as I know, they're even preparing, and that's why I said that if they do it, we'll do the same,” he said, adding that extending the treaty “for at least a year is a good idea.”",Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday that Russia would not worry if the United States decides not to extend the New START treaty.

The air traffic control tower at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport was temporarily evacuated Friday night after a fire alarm and the smell of gas were reported, the Federal Aviation Administration said.During the evacuation, controllers declared “ATC Zero,” halting all tower air traffic services and prompting a ground stop for incoming flights. Some planes in the air were able to land with help from approach controllers, while takeoffs at the busy airport faced delays as staff dealt with the emergency, as per CNN.“A controller told a pilot, ‘Just keep taxiing V then F,’ according to a recording by LiveATC.net. ‘We’re evacuating, so we are going ATC Zero, so you can call the ramp when you get close.’”""ATC Zero"" indicates that the FAA facility is not providing any air traffic control services. Another controller informed a pilot, “Everyone is going downstairs, so we’ll see what is happening here.”“The frequency is going to be unmanned for a while, because I have to evacuate as well,” the ground controller told pilots. “Just hold tight.”A ground stop was implemented for flights headed to the airport, causing delays in takeoffs.Some airborne flights managed to land with assistance from approach controllers, who normally guide planes to the airport before handing them off to the tower for landing.“We actually just landed uncontrolled,” a pilot from a flight originating in Greensboro, South Carolina, told other pilots. “We’re just trying to see what to do next.”“Nobody has taxied, landed or taken off other than you in the last 15 minutes,” another pilot added. Planes were grounded around 5 pm ET. The FAA stated that the ground stop was triggered by an alarm caused by a “strong” gas fume odor. First responders were present at the airport, FOX 5 Atlanta reported.Controllers resumed directing flights, and takeoffs and landings restarted just before 6 p.m. Air traffic controllers are deemed essential employees and are required to work during the govt shutdown, although they will not receive pay until it concludes. Staffing shortages have been reported at air traffic control facilities across the country this week as some controllers have stayed home. However, Atlanta was not listed as short-staffed in Friday evening’s operations plan.","The air traffic control tower at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport was temporarily evacuated Friday night after a fire alarm and the smell of gas were reported.

Trump Undergoes Mystery Health Checkup At Walter Reed Amid Growing Speculations





Donald Trump was declared in “exceptional health” following a medical evaluation, according to a memo released by the White House on Friday, with his “cardiac age” reportedly 14 years younger than his chronological age.""Trump remains in exceptional health, exhibiting strong cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurological, and physical performance,"" Trump's physician Sean Barbabella said in a memo.Trump also underwent preventive health screenings and received immunizations, including his annual flu shot and updated Covid-19 booster, ahead of upcoming international travel.""His cardiac age - a validated measure of cardiovascular vitality via ECG - was found be approximately 14 years younger than his chronological age,"" the memo read.Trump, 79, became the oldest person to be inaugurated as US president in January and ranks as the second oldest to hold the office in American history.Trump visited Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, on Friday morning for a routine annual checkup, as well as a meeting and remarks with military personnel. The visit came six months after he underwent a comprehensive physical examination.A White House memo released after Trump’s April exam noted that he is 6 feet 3 inches (190 cm) tall, weighs 224 pounds (102 kg), and has well-controlled high cholesterol. The memo highlighted both his overall health and his golf performance, as cited by Reuters.Since his April exam, Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a condition often seen in older adults that can lead to leg swelling.Trump’s health has come under scrutiny a year after former President Joe Biden ended his 2024 reelection bid amid questions about his fitness for office. During last year’s campaign, Trump contrasted himself with Biden, presenting himself as younger and in better physical condition.Trump’s former physician, Harold Bornstein, recalled that during the 2015 presidential campaign, Trump dictated a statement, attributed to Bornstein, describing his health as “astonishingly excellent.”Bornstein also said that during a 2019 visit to Walter Reed, Trump asked staff to sign nondisclosure agreements for the appointment, which was later revealed to be a colonoscopy, according to NBC News.","Donald Trump was declared in ""exceptional health"" following a medical evaluation, according to a memo released by the White House on Friday.

Norwegian officials are investigating suspicious online betting on the Polymarket gambling site that suggests a rare leak from the secretive committee responsible for awarding the Nobel Peace Prize Online bets for Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado spiked shortly after midnight on Thursday, Norwegian time, according to information on the site. Kristian Berg Harpviken, head of the Nobel Institute, told Bloomberg: “It seems we have been prey to a criminal actor who wants to earn money on our information.”Hours later, Machado was awarded the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize for her democratic activism in the authoritarian nation, marking the first time a Venezuelan has received the coveted honour, Guardian reported.She was informed of her win at 10.50 Norwegian time by Harpviken. However, two Norwegian newspapers, Aftenposten and Finansavisen, later discovered unusual movement in the online betting markets ahead of the announcement. Until Thursday, Yulia Navalnaya, the economist and widow of former Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, led the odds against all other prospective winners on Polymarket.The site has become a popular place in recent years to wager on political events, with the vast majority of bets focused on American politics.Many of the more niche wagers rely on rumours and speculation, skewing the odds that determine a payout.Shortly after midnight Norwegian time, Machado’s odds were 3.75%, trailing both Navalnaya and Donald Trump.Less than two hours later, however, they surged to 72.8%, suggesting a surge of bets on her victory. In one case, a user won more than Rs 5.4 lakh placing a bet on Machado: another winner used a profile which was created the same day the bet was placed, according to Finansavisen.Jørgen Watne Frydnes, head of the Nobel committee, told Aftenposten the group “tends to be very good at keeping secrets”, citing a highly secretive process over the last half-century. Harpviken told Aftenposten it was “too early to be certain” if the winner had been leaked, but said he expected an investigation to be launched.","Online bets for Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado spiked shortly after midnight on Thursday, Norwegian time.

‘Qatar Great Ally, Be Very Careful’: Donald Trump Blasts Netanyahu After Israel’s Doha Strike





Qatar will build an Air Force facility at US' Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho, defense secretary Pete Hegseth announced on Friday.Hegseth made the announcement at the Pentagon alongside Qatari Defense Minister Sheikh Saoud bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, noting that the agreement will allow Qatari pilots to train alongside US personnel.Hegseth said he is ""proud that today we're signing a letter of acceptance to build a Qatari Emiri Air Force Facility at the Mountain Home Air Base in Idaho.""""The location will host a contingent of Qatari F-15's and pilots to enhance our combined training, increase lethality, interoperability, it's just another example of our partnership,"" he said, as cited by CBS News.""And I hope you know, your excellency, that you can count on us.""While the US does not host any foreign military bases, several allied forces maintain training presences within the country. The Singaporean Air Force, for instance, also operates at Mountain Home Air Force Base.""The US military has a long-standing partnership w/ Qatar, including today's announced cooperation w/ F-15QA aircraft. However, to be clear, Qatar will not have their own base in the United States-nor anything like a base.We control the existing base, like we do with all partners,"" Hegseth later said through a post on X, clarifying that Qatar is not going to have its own military base in the US.The announcement drew strong criticism from Trump ally and right-wing influencer Laura Loomer, who called the plan “an abomination” and accused Qatar of ties to Islamic terrorist organizations.“No foreign country should have a military base on US soil. Especially Islamic countries,” Loomer said through a post on social media.The announcement follows President Donald Trump’s recent executive order pledging to use all measures, including military force, to defend Qatar, home to the largest US military base in the Middle East.Qatar also played a “substantial” role in the Israel-Hamas peace agreement, Hegseth noted Friday, a point echoed by other senior administration officials.Trump’s decision to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 jet from Qatar for use as a presidential plane has sparked debate over ethical and national security implications. Once completed, the aircraft will serve as Air Force One.","Qatar will build an Air Force facility at US' Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho, defense secretary Pete Hegseth announced on Friday.

US government shutdown day 10: White House begins mass federal layoffs; Trump labels job cuts as ‘democrat-oriented’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-government-shutdown-day-10-white-house-begins-mass-federal-layoffs-trump-labels-job-cuts-as-democrat-oriented/articleshow/124468334.cms,"Donald Trump (AP)

US Government Shutdown Enters Second Week: Why It Happened & Who It Impacts





The White House budget office announced Friday that mass layoffs of federal employees have begun, as US President Donald Trump’s administration increases pressure on Democrats amid a government shutdown entering its 10th day.Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought confirmed on X that “RIFs have begun,” referring to reduction-in-force plans to shrink the federal workforce. In a related court filing, the office said more than 4,000 employees would be terminated, though it added that the funding situation remains “fluid and rapidly evolving.”Trump on Friday blamed Democrats for the layoffs, saying many would lose their jobs and hinting the cuts would target “Democrat-oriented areas.”“They started this thing,” Trump told reporters during an Oval Office event, describing the job cuts as “democrat-oriented.”“It’ll be a lot, and we’ll announce the numbers over the next couple of days,” Trump said. “But it’ll be a lot of people.”“These are people that the Democrats wanted, that, in many cases, were not appropriate,” Trump said of federal employees, adding, “many of them will be fired.”Job cuts were underway across several agencies, including the Treasury Department, the Department of Health and Human Services, the IRS, and the departments of Education, Commerce, and Homeland Security’s cybersecurity division, officials said.The full scale of the layoffs remains unclear, though about 300,000 federal civilian workers were already expected to depart this year as part of Trump’s broader downsizing initiative, as cited by Reuters.Trump has also ordered a freeze on at least $28 billion in infrastructure funding for New York, California, and Illinois, states with large Democratic constituencies and vocal critics of his administration.According to a Justice Department court filing, more than 4,200 federal employees across seven agencies have received layoff notices, including over 1,400 at the Treasury Department and at least 1,100 at the Department of Health and Human Services.The Education Department confirmed on Friday that it was among the agencies hit by new layoffs. A labor union said nearly all staff below the director level at the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education were being dismissed, while fewer than 10 employees were cut from the Office of Communications and Outreach.Layoff notices were also issued at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), part of the Department of Homeland Security, which said the move was aimed at “getting CISA back on mission.” CISA has previously drawn Trump’s criticism for challenging misinformation about the 2020 election and the Covid-19 pandemic, as reported by AP.Earlier this week, Trump hinted that layoffs could arrive in “four or five days.”“If this keeps going on, it’ll be substantial, and a lot of those jobs will never come back,” he said on Tuesday.","White House budget office says mass layoffs of federal employees have begun.

10 days after 6.9 earthquake that left 74 dead





A powerful earthquake measuring 7.6 magnitude struck the Mindanao region of the Philippines on Friday, triggering tsunami warnings for nearby coastal areas, according to the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC).The earthquake occurred at a depth of 58 kilometers beneath the surface and has left two people dead.EMSC had initially reported the earthquake's magnitude as 7.2 before revising it upward to 7.6.The US Tsunami Warning System had issued an alert, warning that dangerous tsunami waves could potentially affect coastal areas within 300 kilometers of the earthquake's epicenter.Indonesia also issued a tsunami warning for northern Sulawesi and Papua regions after a strong earthquake hit the southern Philippines, Indonesia's geophysics agency said.The agency's modelling suggested there was a risk of tsunami waves as high as 50 cm hitting Indonesia's shorelines, it said in a statement.The warning has now been lifted.The Philippines is still grappling with the aftermath of a 6.9 magnitude earthquake that struck on September 30, claiming 74 lives and forcing thousands to evacuate in Cebu province, particularly affecting Bogo city and surrounding areas.The Philippines' location on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire,"" an arc of seismic faults around the ocean, makes it particularly vulnerable to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.The country faces approximately 20 typhoons and storms annually, requiring extensive disaster response efforts from both government agencies and volunteer organizations.These natural disasters have established the Philippines as one of the world's most disaster-prone nations, demanding constant preparedness and response mechanisms.","The earthquake occurred at a depth of 58 kilometers beneath the surface and has left two people dead.

US President Donald Trump on Friday expressed optimism for the Israel-Hamas ceasefire and said that after the hostage release, Gaza will be rebuilt, citing anticipated financing from wealthy Arab neighbors, and will set a board of peace.Answering the question over the Israel-Hamas deal, where key members signed the ""first phase"" on Wednesday, Trump said that he will soon go to Israel, will speak at the Knesset (Israel's Parliament) and Then he will go to Egypt.""Gaza is going to be rebuilt.

Firings of federal workers begin as White House seeks to pressure Democrats in government shutdown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/firings-of-federal-workers-begin-as-white-house-seeks-to-pressure-democrats-in-government-shutdown/articleshow/124466425.cms,".

‘NONSENSE!’: Johnson REJECTS Jeffries’ ‘DESPERATE’ Government Shutdown Debate Offer





WASHINGTON: The White House budget office said Friday that mass firings of federal workers have started in an attempt to exert more pressure on Democratic lawmakers in the ongoing government shutdown.Russ Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said on the social media site X that the ""RIFs have begun,"" referring to reduction-in-force plans aimed at reducing the size of the federal government.A spokesperson for the budget office said the reductions are ""substantial"" but did not offer more immediate details.The Education Department is among the agencies hit by new layoffs , a department spokesperson said Friday without providing more details. The department had about 4,100 employees when Trump took office in January, but its workforce was nearly halved amid mass layoffs in the Republican administration's first months. At the start of the shutdown, it had about 2,500 employees.Federal health workers were also being fired Friday, though a US Department of Health and Human Services spokesman did not say how many or which agencies were being hit hardest. And an official for the American Federation of Government Employees, who is suing the Trump administration over the firings, said in a legal filing Friday that the Treasury Department is set to issue layoff notices to 1,300 employees.Notices of firings have also taken place at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which leads federal efforts to reduce risk to the nation's cyber and physical infrastructure, according to a person familiar with the actions who spoke anonymously because they were not authorised to discuss them.The White House previewed that it would pursue the aggressive layoff tactic shortly before the government shutdown began on Oct. 1, telling all federal agencies to submit their reduction-in-force plans to the budget office for its review. It said reduction-in-force plans could apply to federal programs whose funding would lapse in a government shutdown, are otherwise not funded and are ""not consistent with the President's priorities. ""This goes far beyond what usually happens in a government shutdown, which is that federal workers are furloughed but restored to their jobs once the shutdown ends.Democrats have tried to call the administration's bluff, arguing the firings could be illegal, and seemed bolstered by the fact that the White House had yet to carry out the firings.But President Donald Trump said earlier this week that he would soon have more information about how many federal jobs would be eliminated.""I'll be able to tell you that in four or five days if this keeps going on,"" he said Tuesday in the Oval Office as he met with Canada's prime minister, Mark Carney. ""If this keeps going on, it'll be substantial, and a lot of those jobs will never come back.""The AFGE, a labor union for federal employees, asked a federal judge Friday for a restraining order to halt the firings, calling the action an abuse of power designed to punish workers and pressure Congress.""It is disgraceful that the Trump administration has used the government shutdown as an excuse to illegally fire thousands of workers who provide critical services to communities across the country,"" said the president of the American Federation of Government Employees, Everett Kelley, in a statement.Meanwhile, the halls of the Capitol were quiet on Friday, the 10th day of the shutdown, with both the House and the Senate out of Washington and both sides digging in for a protracted shutdown fight. Senate Republicans have tried repeatedly to cajole Democratic holdouts to vote for a stopgap bill to reopen the government, but Democrats have refused as they hold out for a firm commitment to extend health care benefits.Some Republicans on Capitol Hill have suggested that Vought's threats of mass layoffs have been unhelpful to bipartisan talks on the funding standoff.The top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, said in a statement that the ""shutdown does not give Trump or Vought new, special powers"" to lay off workers.""This is nothing new, and no one should be intimidated by these crooks,"" she added.The top Senate Democrat, New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, said the blame for the layoffs rested with Trump.""Let's be blunt: nobody's forcing Trump and Vought to do this,"" Schumer said. ""They don't have to do it; they want to. They're callously choosing to hurt people-the workers who protect our country, inspect our food, respond when disasters strike. This is deliberate chaos.""Still, there was no sign that the top Democratic and Republican Senate leaders were even talking about a way to solve the impasse. Instead, Senate Majority Leader John Thune continued to try to peel away centrist Democrats who may be willing to cross party lines as the shutdown pain dragged on.""It's time for them to get a backbone,"" Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said during a news conference.The Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan organisation that tracks federal service, says that more than 200,000 civil servants have left since the start of this administration in January due to earlier firings, retirements and deferred resignation offers.""These unnecessary and misguided reductions in force will further hollow out our federal government, rob it of critical expertise and hobble its capacity to effectively serve the public,"" said the organisation's president and CEO, Max Stier.","The Education Department is among the agencies hit by new layoffs, a department spokesperson says. The AFGE, a labor union for federal employees, asked a federal judge Friday for a restraining order to halt the firings.

First Lady Melania Trump Friday made a rare announcement in which she said she opened a private channel of communication with Russian President Vladimir Putin since she wrote him a letter in August on the impact of the war on kids in Ukraine. Following months of private discussion between Russian officials and Melania's office, Russia allowed eight Ukrainian children to reunite with their parents.Melania announced that these eight children were all returned to their families over the last 24 hours with a commitment that the two sides will continue to work toward reunifying additional children displaced as part of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.“This remains an ongoing effort,” Melania Trump said in a brief speech at the White House. “Plans are already underway to reunify more children in the immediate future. I hope peace will come soon. It can begin with our children.”In August, Melania received praise for writing a letter to Putin that Trump delivered to him.

Riots Erupt As Pro-Palestine Protests Explode Globally, Cops Battle ‘Israel Haters’ In Major Cities





LAHORE: Violent clashes erupted Friday between police and Islamists in Pakistan 's eastern city of Lahore after security forces tried to stop thousands of demonstrators from leaving for the capital, Islamabad, where they planned to stage a pro-Palestinian rally outside the US Embassy, officials said.The clashes in the capital of Punjab province began Thursday but intensified Friday after police baton-charged the demonstrators and fired tear gas to disperse them at multiple locations. Protesters hurled stones at officers in response.In a statement, the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan party, or TLP, claimed that two of its supporters had been killed and 50 others injured since Thursday. There was no immediate comment from the Punjab provincial government, which is headed by Punjab chief minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif, the niece of the prime minister.The protest comes after Hamas and Israel agreed to a ceasefire plan brokered by US President Donald Trump.Speaking to thousands of worshippers in Lahore at Friday prayers, TLP chief Saad Rizvi announced the march, saying, ""We will now march from Lahore to the US Embassy"" in Islamabad.He said: ""I will walk at the head of the long march. Arrest is not a problem, bullets are not a problem, shells are not a problem - martyrdom is our destiny.""Police officers were swinging batons and firing tear gas to disperse demonstrators near the main TLP office, according to witnesses, who said residents also faced severe difficulties because of the tear gas.The violence has disrupted daily life in parts of Lahore, as residents struggled to reach home because of road closures and continued clashes.On Friday, authorities shut schools, colleges and universities in Lahore, a city of more than 14 million people.The government of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has suspended mobile internet service in Islamabad and nearby Rawalpindi as part of measures aimed at preventing demonstrators from reaching the national capital.Authorities have also placed shipping containers along the main motorway, the main highways and roads leading to Islamabad to block protesters.Lahore is about 350 kilometers (210 miles) from Islamabad.The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad issued a security alert ahead of the march, warning of possible disruptions and urging American citizens to exercise caution.""Large crowds and traffic congestion are expected, along with a precautionary security presence, an increased number of checkpoints, and associated disruptions to local mobile and internet networks in the region,"" the embassy said, adding that the duration of the protests is unknown.It advised U.S. citizens to avoid large gatherings, remain aware of their surroundings and keep a low profile.Deputy Interior Minister Talal Chaudhry said Thursday that the TLP had not submitted a request for permission to hold the rally. The group denied the claim, saying it had applied for permission for a peaceful march to express solidarity with Palestinians.The TLP, known for staging disruptive and sometimes violent protests, has drawn criticism online. But many users have accused the government of overreacting by blocking roads even before the demonstrators began their march.""Why are these demonstrators coming to Islamabad for the rally when the peace process has already started in Palestine?"" asked Mohammad Ashfaq, 35, as he turned back from a road block in Islamabad.He said he tried using longer routes to reach the city, but police had also blocked those roads with shipping containers. ""Now I'll have to figure out again how to reach my office,"" he said.","Clashes erupt in Lahore as police try to stop pro-Palestine march to Islamabad.

How Trump’s self-promotion cost him







Opposition leader María Corina Machado of Venezuela has been awarded the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize , beating a crowded field of nominees that included US President Donald Trump , whose campaign for the honour had drawn international attention. The Nobel Committee said it was honouring Machado “for her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy. ”The decision dealt a personal blow to Trump, who had publicly lobbied for the award, calling himself the “president of peace” and repeatedly claiming to have “ended six or seven wars.” But it is also a diplomatic setback for Pakistan , one of the countries that had formally nominated Trump for the prize, portraying him as a “champion of peace.”Pakistan had gone all in on Trump this year. Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif and Field Marshall Asim Munir made a visit to the White House in August, where they met Trump in a rare Oval Office engagement. Islamabad hailed the meeting as a breakthrough moment in US-Pakistan ties, saying the two sides had discussed cooperation on counter-terrorism, regional security, and new economic ventures. This was Munir’s third trip to the oval office just this year alone.Sharif, speaking later at the United Nations, described Trump as “a champion of peace” and said nominating him for the Nobel Peace Prize was “the least we could do.” Pakistan’s nomination cited Trump’s claimed role in “de-escalating” tensions between India and Pakistan, a claim New Delhi has consistently rejected.In recent months, the Trump administration has pushed to deepen economic ties with Islamabad even as trade talks with India remain stalled. The US government announced its intent to collaborate with Pakistan on critical minerals and hydrocarbons, while Trump himself unveiled a plan to help Pakistan develop its “massive oil reserves.”On his Truth Social platform, Trump said, “We have finalised a deal with Pakistan, where both countries will collaborate on developing Pakistan’s extensive oil reserves… Perhaps, in the future, they might sell oil to India!”The boast turned out to be wildly optimistic. According to energy data, Pakistan has just 0.02% of the world’s crude oil reserves, less than a tenth of India’s production. Yet Islamabad’s enthusiasm for Trump reflected both economic desperation and the hope of finding a patron in Washington amid regional isolation.For Islamabad, Trump’s loss is more than symbolic. Pakistan’s government had staked diplomatic capital on its public embrace of the US president, even as India-Pakistan tensions simmered. By nominating Trump and describing him as a “friend of peace,” Sharif’s administration had hoped to reset relations with Washington, a move seen as a pivot away from Beijing.Instead, Pakistan now faces embarrassment on two fronts: Trump’s failure to win the Nobel Prize and the exposure of Islamabad’s overreach. The White House never released an official readout of the Trump–Sharif–Munir meeting, and Washington’s silence contrasted sharply with Islamabad’s exuberant press releases and photos of a smiling Trump flashing his signature thumbs-up.The loss also weakens Pakistan’s argument that Trump’s mediation ended the brief but intense India–Pakistan conflict earlier this year, a claim denied by India’s military, which maintains that the ceasefire was negotiated directly between the two countries’ commanders.For now, the Nobel Peace Prize has gone to a woman fighting for democracy in Venezuela. But for Donald Trump and his unlikely backers in Islamabad the snub serves as a reminder that peace cannot be won through press releases or self-congratulation. It must be earned.For Trump, the Nobel campaign was intensely personal. Over the past year, he has repeatedly told reporters that he “should have gotten [the prize] four or five times” and that “everyone says” he deserves it. He even reminded UN delegates in September that his “peace record” was unmatched, claiming to have ended wars between Israel and Iran, India and Pakistan, and “even Thailand and Cambodia.”But this relentless self-promotion likely backfired. Members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee have long avoided appearing to reward leaders who lobby openly for recognition. “We base our decision only on the work and the will of Alfred Nobel,” Committee Chair Jørgen Watne Frydnes said, adding that lobbying or political pressure had “no bearing” on their choice.Moreover, Trump’s record remains divisive. While he claims credit for brokering ceasefires, critics point out that many conflicts he boasts of ending were never formally resolved, and others, such as the war in Ukraine, continue to rage. His domestic policies including mass deportations, expanded war powers, and withdrawal from global climate pacts have also undercut his image as a peacemaker.As one expert told the Associated Press, the Nobel Committee prefers to honour the “durability of peace and the quiet work of institutions”, not the “rhetoric of power.”","María Corina Machado of Venezuela has been awarded the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize.
