Eid congregation was moved to Red Road in 1919: Judge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eid-congregation-was-moved-to-red-road-in-1919-judge/articleshow/120222675.cms,"Eid congregation was shifted from Shahid Minar to Red Road back in 1919, when Shahid Minar got waterlogged, Justice Tirthankar Ghosh said.The judge wanted to know whether a Hanuman Chalisa recital had ever been organised on Red Road. ""The main thrust of your argument is that permission was given to another community, and hence it should be given to you,"" Justice Ghosh told the petitioner's counsel. Advocate general Kishore Datta pointed out that the puja carnival was part of National List of Heritage Programmes and linked to a festival with a Unesco heritage tag .He cited a 1994 SC judgment in which it said permission to organise prayers in a public place was subject to the site's religious significance. ""I do not have the right to worship or offer prayers at any and every place. The petitioner must show that the place has religious significance integral to the religion,"" Datta said.When counsel for the petitioner next moved division bench of Chief Justice T S Sivagnanam and Justice Chaitali Chatterjee (Das), the former initially declined to admit the plea. ""I don't want to hear petitions on Hanuman Jayanti and Ram Navami anymore,"" Chief Justice Sivagnanam said.Although the organisation was allowed to file the petition, the division bench declined to overrule the single judge bench's order. ""For establishment of a right to hold any religious practice at a public place for the first time, the right has to be established before the court of law through the exchange of affidavits,"" Justice Ghosh said.The bench kept the matter open for adjudication and directed that it be included in the list of cases slated for July.","Eid congregation was shifted from Shahid Minar to Red Road back in 1919, Justice Tirthankar Ghosh said.

NEW DELHI: Tahawwur Rana (64), one of the main plotters of the 26/11 Mumbai attack , is being kept on "" suicide watch "" in a highly secure cell within National Investigation Agency (NIA) headquarters here after a special court granted his 18-day custody to the anti-terror agency.The Pakistani-Canadian, who was brought here on Thursday evening following his extradition from the US, is under 24/7 human and CCTV surveillance. The NIA HQ on Lodhi Road has been blanketed in multi-layered security. ""Rana has been kept in a 14x14 cell on the ground floor. He will be allowed only a soft-tip pen to write so that he can't harm himself,"" a source said.On Friday, NIA began questioning Rana to unravel the larger conspiracy behind the terror strike. The interrogation is likely to focus on, besides his connection with ISI, involvement with sleeper cells in India, particularly those linked to his associate, David Coleman Headley , alias Daood Gilani. Headley is suspected to have recruited sleeper cells in Pushkar, Goa, Delhi and other places, sources said.On a day Mumbai terror attack accused Tahawwur Hussain Rana was extradited from the US to India, Congress said Modi govt did not initiate the process and in fact benefited from the ""mature, consistent and strategic diplomacy"" that began under UPA.In a statement, former union minister P Chidambaram said that ""while Modi govt is rushing to take credit for this development, the truth is far from their spin.""""This extradition is not the result of any grandstanding, it is a testament to what the Indian state can achieve when diplomacy, law enforcement, and international cooperation are pursued sincerely and without any kind of chest-thumping,"" Chidambaram said.

Visuals from the area showed flames and smoke billowing from burning vehicles as security forces were deployed to restore order.The Bengal Police said the situation in the Suti and Samserganj areas of Jangipur was now “under control”. Security has been heightened, and large contingents of police have been stationed in sensitive pockets of the district.The latest unrest follows violent protests on Tuesday at Umarpur in the same district, where nine people, including four policemen, were injured during clashes. Protesters, who had blocked NH-12 in Jangipur demanding withdrawal of the Waqf (Amendment) Act, pelted stones at the police and set two police vehicles ablaze. “Strict action will be taken against those who resorted to violence. Legal action will be initiated against rumour mongers trying to spread misinformation,” the police had said in a statement.Prohibitory orders remain in force around the Raghunathganj and Suti police station areas, with internet services suspended in Jangipur subdivision to curb the spread of rumours. “The situation is calm, peaceful and under control. There has not been a single untoward incident. Prohibitory orders will remain in place till 6 pm on April 10 (Thursday), and the internet suspension will continue till 6 pm on April 11 (Friday),” said a senior officer.Governor C V Ananda Bose condemned the violence and demanded accountability from the state government. “Attempts to disturb the law and order situation should be put down with an iron hand. The peaceful passage of Ram Navami festivities shows the camaraderie among the people of Bengal and the competence of the administration. Any attempt to frustrate that needs to be curbed,” he said.However, the state government faced criticism from multiple quarters. Mass education minister Siddiqullah Chowdhury said, “Even during the Left rule, police never baton-charged minorities. If someone has resorted to violence, action must be taken. But resorting to lathi charge on a rally is unacceptable.”The BJP accused Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee of failing to maintain law and order. “West Bengal, once safeguarded by Syama Prasad Mookerjee, is now bleeding under Mamata Banerjee,” said state BJP chief Sukanta Majumdar, labelling her “India’s most failed CM”.The Waqf (Amendment) Act, which triggered the protests, was passed by the parliament last week.","The Bengal Police said the situation in the Suti and Samserganj areas of Jangipur was now “under control’ The latest unrest follows violent protests on Tuesday at Umarpur in the same district, where nine people, including four policemen, were injured.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120222547,imgsize-5068198,width-400,resizemode-4/Watch-Vehicles-torched-security-stepped-up-as-Waqf-Act-protest-turns-violent-in-Bengals-Murshidabad.jpg"

justice for 26/11 victims

: Rubio

NEW DELHI:“Indians deserved it,” an exultant Tahawwur Rana told fellow jihadi David Coleman Headley aka Daood Gilani, his words dripping with venom, as he spoke about the 26/11 carnage. Unsurprisingly, the remark celebrating the massacre of 166 innocent civilians found mention in the US justice department’s statement explaining his extradition to India.Justice department also released photographs of Rana being handed over by US Marshals to NIA in Los Angeles. The photos show Rana in prison browns, shackled with chains around his waist and legs.“In an intercepted conversation with Headley, Rana allegedly commended the nine LeT terrorists who were killed committing the attacks, saying they should be given Nishan-e-Haider — Pakistan’s highest award for gallantry in battle, which is reserved for fallen soldiers,” the statement further said, something which served to underline yet again the nexus between Lashkar-e-Tai ba terrorists who traumatised Mumbai and Pakistan’s military-intelligence complex.It was perhaps due to Rana being such a high value asset for Pakistan that the aircraft transporting him from the US steered clear of Pakistani airspace. Sources said the plane flew over Iran to come to India.Even in NIA’s custody, Rana hasn’t shown an iota of remorse, a source said. “He has been calm and composed, without any tantrums,” he added.The prosecution by India is not a first for Rana who has been accused of conspiring to commit violent acts of terrorism. In 2013, he was sentenced to 14 years in prison following his conviction in the Northern District of Illinois, US, for conspiring to provide material support to LeT and to a foiled LeT-sponsored terrorist plot in Copenhagen, Denmark.“As part of those same criminal proceedings, Headley had pleaded guilty to 12 federal terrorism charges , including aiding and abetting the murders of six Americans in Mumbai and later planning to attack a Danish newspaper, and was sentenced to 35 years in prison,"" the US justice department statement said.The US extradited Tahawwur Rana to India to face charges for his role in planning the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack , secretary of state Marco Rubio said on Friday. “Together, with India, we’ve long sought justice for the 166 people, including six Americans, who lost their lives in these attacks. I'm glad that day has come,” he said on X.His counterpart S Jaishankar responded, appreciating the counter-terrorism cooperation between the countries. “This is indeed a big step in ensuring justice for victims of 26/11 attacks ,” he said.The state department said, “The US has long supported India’s efforts to ensure those responsible for these attacks are brought to justice. As President Trump has said, the US and India will continue to work together to combat the global scourge of terrorism.” TNN","The US extradited Tahawwur Rana to India to face charges for his role in planning the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack. “Together, with India, we’ve long sought justice for the 166 people, including six Americans, who lost their lives in these attacks.

Within minutes, the upper floors of the 12-storeyed building were covered by rising columns of thick black smoke from the fire which could be seen raging inside the chute through its vents. The heat melted the chute's metal doors and damaged apartment doors.As heat and smoke filled even the lower floors, residents were seen trying to escape the building from balconies on staircase landings. In a heart-stopping moment captured on video, a woman and two children are seen surviving a brush with death.The woman one by one held the two young children by their arms over a fourth-floor balcony wall while calling for help. Two men who rushed to the floor below, are seen in the video precariously balancing themselves on the balcony's parapet and catching the children as she drops them one after the other into their waiting arms.The woman herself came dangerously close to falling when she hung from the balcony wall in a bid to land on the floor below her but missed her footing. Rescuers caught her by the ankles just in time as she fell head-first. Residents assisted one another in the evacuation as flames reached almost every floor, consuming the building's electric cabling and everything else in their path. Unable to see due to the thick smoke, people groped along walls to find their way down the building stairs.Eyewitnesses described a scene of chaos and urgency as people waved from balconies, screaming for help while some scrambled for exits before the arrival of the fire brigade.As fire in the main electric line posed an added risk to rescue operations, Torrent Power was contacted to immediately cut off supply to prevent more serious damage. Teams from the Ahmedabad Fire and Emergency Services (AFES) reached the site promptly and started evacuating residents using ladders and breathing gear. Nearly seven fire tenders took around two hours to douse the fire and rescue people.AFES and police have started a detailed probe into the cause of the fire and are assessing the structural safety of the affected floors. Families from the affected block have moved in with friends and relatives. For others, arrangements of food and stay have been made at the society gym.","Eighteen people were rescued by fire brigade personnel, with some residents suffering minor injuries.

He spoke on Friday, minutes after Kolkata Police top brass blamed the teachers for Wednesday's trouble.""What could have been our motive? What did we gain from it? Everyone saw how a policeman kicked me. We are the victims, not criminals,"" Bhuniya added while waiting outside the School Service Commission office in Salt Lake on Friday.The reaction came shortly after CP Manoj Verma and Joint CP (crime and traffic) Rupesh Kumar held a press conference, showing multiple videos and photos blaming the teachers and claiming there were calls to burn down the district school inspector's office.However, protest leaders rejected this narrative, calling it a deliberate attempt to criminalise their movement. ""The cops are lying about the entire scenario,"" said Mehbub Mandal, a prominent face of the protest who was present at Kasba on Wednesday. ""One of the teachers was so frustrated he was crying and screaming that he would pour petrol on himself. That is the audio they are misrepresenting. No one spoke of burning down any office, and no teacher has ever damaged govt property.""More than 2,500 aggrieved teachers, recently dismissed following a Supreme Court verdict that nullified their appointments, staged a protest march on Friday from Karunamoyee in Salt Lake to the West Bengal School Service Commission (SSC) Bhavan, demanding the release of Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) sheets to identify genuine candidates.After the march, they camped outside the SSC office as 13 teachers and non-teaching staff went inside to meet education minister and SSC officials for a three-hour meeting.""Do the cops have any evidence of any of us carrying any arms during Wednesday's protest or at the rallies on Thursday and Friday? We are teachers, and all we were carrying were our pens and hearts full of pain. We plead with the cops not to tag us as criminals,"" said Sidhartha Shankar Mondal, another jobless teacher who was also injured during Wednesday's scuffle at Kasba and participated in Friday's march.Waving placards and shouting slogans, they asked the SSC to disclose the OMR sheets to differentiate between eligible and ineligible candidates. However, while Thursday's rally saw a number of faces — many of them Left associates and civil society members — who marched during the RG Kar protests joining the protests, on Friday, there was a public announcement by aggrieved teachers asking outsiders to stay out of the protest march.""We don't want any outsiders in this rally. This is our protest, and we don't want the issues to get diluted because of outside interference or unnecessary politicisation,"" said one of the jobless teachers.A large section of jobless teachers maintained distance from Abhaya Mancha members like Dr Punyabrata Goon and other known faces, despite Goon sitting next to the three teachers staging a hunger strike and suggesting setting up a medical camp at the spot over the weekend.""We have crossed multiple hurdles to pass the exam and get a dignified job. We had to submit papers 22 times and go through different selection process including written test, verification and interview. Why will we lose our job for others' corruption?

US President Donald Trump on Friday authorized the US military to take charge of a strip of public land along the southern border, citing the need for stronger security in the face of various threats.In his justification, the president stated that the complexity of the current border situation requires a more direct role from the military in securing the southern border than in previous years. The memorandum released by the White House orders the Secretaries of Defense, Interior, Agriculture, and Homeland Security to transfer jurisdiction of federal lands along the border to the Department of Defense.The order outlines that the military will be responsible for constructing a border wall and deploying detection and monitoring equipment. However, the military’s mandate is intentionally broad, defined as activities deemed ""reasonably necessary and appropriate to accomplish the mission.""The memorandum specifically mentions the Roosevelt Reservation, which runs through California, Arizona, and New Mexico. It directs Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to begin with phased military implementation on specific sections of public land, but he has the authority to extend operations to other areas of public land along the border.This move comes as Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Kristi Noem reported during a cabinet meeting that illegal border crossings had decreased significantly, with February marking a second consecutive month of record low encounters at the southern border.President Trump, since taking office, has made border security a priority. His administration quickly implemented a series of executive actions aimed at reforming immigration and border enforcement policies. One of the first actions he took was declaring a national emergency at the southern border on his first day in office. Additionally, government data from March indicated a sharp decline in illegal border crossings, reaching the lowest levels in at least 25 years during his first full month in office.","US President Donald Trump on Friday authorized the US military to take charge of a strip of public land along the southern border.

Spain wants Israel ousted from Eurovision song contest over its role in Gaza war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/spain-wants-israel-ousted-from-eurovision-song-contest-over-its-role-in-gaza-war/articleshow/120222168.cms,"Spain's RTVE has urged the EBU to debate Israel's Eurovision participation due to the Gaza war, prompting the EBU to acknowledge concerns while affirming all members' eligibility. The contest, set in Basel, faces protests over Israel's inclusion, with Yuval Raphael representing the nation amidst the ongoing conflict that began on October 7, 2023.

Spain’s public broadcaster RTVE has asked the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) to open a debate on whether Israel should take part in the upcoming Eurovision Song Contest due to its role in the Gaza war.In a statement on Friday, RTVE said it had written to the EBU, which organises the contest, to raise the issue of Israel’s participation through its public broadcaster KAN, reported news agency AFP.The EBU responded by saying it appreciated the “deeply held views” surrounding the Middle East conflict but added that all its member broadcasters remain eligible to compete. It said it was in ongoing discussions with all participating broadcasters, including RTVE.Eurovision is one of the world’s most-watched television events, involving countries from Europe to Australia. This year’s contest will be held in Basel, Switzerland, with the semi-finals scheduled for May 13 and 15, and the final on May 17. If KAN is excluded, Israel will not have a contestant at this year’s event.Thousands had protested Israel’s participation in last year’s contest in Sweden. This year, Israel will be represented by Yuval Raphael, a survivor of the October 7 Hamas-led attack on the Nova music festival, according to The Times of Israel.Petitions in other countries, including Finland, have also called for Israel’s removal from the contest. One was signed by over 10,000 members of the public.Israel has won Eurovision four times, most recently in 2018.The Gaza war began on October 7, 2023, when Hamas militants carried out an attack that killed about 1,200 people in Israel. In response, Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza, where local authorities report nearly 51,000 deaths.Spain's Eurovision stance and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez recently visiting China as US imposed new tariffs on European Union goods are its two recent moves at odds with US. Washington has also been escalating trade tensions with China with a whopping 145 percent tariff. China retaliated with 125 percent tariffs on American goods.","Spain's RTVE has asked the EBU to debate Israel's Eurovision participation due to the Gaza war.

In US for over 30 days? Foreign nationals told to register with govt or face deportation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/in-us-for-over-30-days-foreign-nationals-told-to-register-with-govt-or-face-deportation/articleshow/120222179.cms,"Karoline Leavitt

Trump administration revokes hundreds of student visas across U.S. within weeks

All foreign nationals staying in the United States for more than 30 days must register with the federal government to avoid fines and imprisonment.An individual will also be deported if failed to comply with the new rule.""All foreign nationals present in the United States longer than 30 days must register with the federal government. Failure to comply with this is a crime punishable by fines, imprisonment, or both... If not, you will be arrested, fined, deported, never to return to our country again,"" assistant to US President Donald Trump and White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said.A controversial regulation from the Trump administration to register comes after a green light from a federal judge. The rule, rooted in a statute dating back to World War II, has sparked legal challenges and widespread concern among immigrant communities across the United States.US District Judge Trevor N. McFadden, appointed by President Donald Trump, issued an order on April 10 rejecting a request from advocacy groups seeking to halt the rule’s implementation. The judge concluded that the organizations lacked sufficient legal standing to challenge the new policy. His decision comes just one day before the regulation is scheduled to be enforced.The new rule mandates that any foreign national present in the US for over 30 days must register with the federal government. It also requires those already considered registered—including visa holders and lawful permanent residents—to carry proof of their status at all times. Failure to comply could result in fines up to $5,000 or imprisonment for up to 30 days.Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem emphasized the urgency of the rule, stating in a press release: “President Trump and I have a clear message for those in our country illegally: leave now. If you leave now, you may have the opportunity to return and enjoy our freedom and live the American dream.” She added, “The Trump administration will enforce all our immigration laws—we will not pick and choose which laws we will enforce. We must know who is in our country for the safety and security of our homeland and all Americans.”According to DHS guidelines, individuals arriving in the US after April 11 must register within 30 days if they lack registration documentation. Even children turning 14, regardless of prior registration, are required to re-register and submit fingerprints within 30 days of their birthday.Critics, including organizations such as the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights and the American Immigration Council, argue that the rule sidesteps public input and could cause widespread confusion. They contend it violates the Administrative Procedure Act, which requires federal agencies to follow a transparent rulemaking process. Despite this, the Trump administration maintains the measure is a long-overdue enforcement of the Alien Registration Act .The interim final rule was officially introduced on March 12 by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), following an executive order signed by Trump on January 20 titled “Protecting the American People Against Invasion.”The regulation's implications are far-reaching, especially for the sizable undocumented population. Estimates vary significantly: while the Department of Homeland Security reports that there were about 220,000 undocumented Indians in the US as of 2022, the Migration Policy Institute pegs the number closer to 375,000. The Pew Research Center places the figure even higher, at roughly 700,000.Immigration attorneys have clarified that individuals holding visas—such as H-1B workers or international students—as well as green card holders and those with employment authorization documents, are already considered registered. However, even they must carry documents at all times and promptly report any address changes within 10 days to avoid penalties.Parents of minors who remain in the country for more than 30 days must also ensure their children are registered. The sweeping new mandate is likely to reshape the daily lives of millions of immigrants, regardless of whether they are documented or not.","US District Judge Trevor N.

THANE: Two days after Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) protested against the use of Hindi and English on barriers at the Metro 12 construction site in Dombivli, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority ( MMRDA ) on Friday began replacing the Hindi signage with Marathi.A day earlier, MMRDA officials had said they had instructed the contractor to include Marathi alongside English. The protest had escalated, with MNS workers defacing the barriers and former corporator Prabhakar Jadhav warning that the issue would be handled “in MNS style.”Following its campaign targeting banks, MNS has now hinted that its next agitation will focus on educational institutions.

However, following the protests, the United Forum of Bank Unions wrote to CM Fadnavis alleging that individuals claiming to be MNS members had visited bank branches and intimidated employees.At his Gudi Padwa rally on 30 March, Thackeray reiterated the party’s stance on making Marathi mandatory for official use and warned that those who deliberately avoid speaking the language would be ""slapped.""", MMRDA replaced Hindi signage with Marathi at the Metro 12 construction site in Dombivli.

The Yeltsin-era minister responded to this labelling by calling it ""the stupidity of the regime.""According to Reuters, Kozyrev, 74, was the first foreign minister of post-Soviet Russia , serving under President Boris Yeltsin in the early 1990s when the country maintained relatively warm ties with the West. Now residing in the United States since 2010, Kozyrev has become an outspoken critic of Kremlin policies and Russia’s military actions in Ukraine .In 2022, after the start of the war in Ukraine, Kozyrev publicly called on his former colleagues in the Russian foreign ministry to resign in protest.The justice ministry accused Kozyrev of spreading false information about Russian government policies and military activities. It also cited his opposition to the war—referred to by Moscow as a ""special military operation""—and his alleged collaboration “with foreign platforms.”Responding to the move, Kozyrev dismissed the designation, saying it reflected ""the stupidity of the regime.""""I am glad to join those noble people who have likewise been designated foreign agents,"" he added.The ""foreign agent"" label, rooted in Soviet-era terminology, carries a strong stigma and requires individuals to publicly identify themselves as such in all publications and online posts. It also imposes strict financial reporting rules.Numerous writers, journalists, and cultural figures critical of the war have faced the same designation in recent years.","Andrei Kozyrev, 74, was the first foreign minister of post-Soviet Russia in the early 1990s.

Denmark started the process of approving a new defence agreement with the United States that will allow American troops to be stationed on its mainland. The Danish parliament held the first of three readings of the bill on Friday, with a final vote expected by the end of June, says news agency Reuters.According to The Local, the deal gives the US military access to three Danish airbases—Aalborg, Karup, and Skrydstrup—all located in the Jutland region. The significant shift in Denmark’s defence policy is due to the heightened tensions in Europe because of Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine.Local media Jyllands-Posten, reports that the deal could see armed private security firms, working for the US military, stationed in Denmark. The potential presence of foreign armed personnel has raised eyebrows.The agreement is expected to pass, with several opposition parties backing the minority government. However, left-wing groups like the Alternative and Red-Green Alliance have voiced strong opposition. They argue that the deal compromises Danish sovereignty and opens the door to an American military footprint in the region.A Voxmeter poll found public opinion to be divided—41 percent support the agreement, 33 percent oppose it, and 27 percent remain undecided.Notably, Denmark has made it clear that Greenland, which has been the subject of interest to US President Donald Trump, is not part of this deal. The government has ruled out ceding the territory, even as it deepens its military ties with Washington.","The Danish parliament held the first of three readings of the bill on Friday, with a final vote expected by the end of June.

WATCH: RFK Jr. says Trump administration will identify and eliminate cause of autism 'by September'

US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr has launched a new study to investigate what he calls the autism “epidemic”, but the move has alarmed many in the medical community. They say the effort could promote long-debunked claims linking vaccines to autism—claims Kennedy has repeatedly pushed in the past.Speaking on Thursday, Kennedy said the study would involve hundreds of scientists and promised results by September. He added that the goal would be to “eliminate those exposures”, which many believe was a reference to vaccines.Autism organisations and health experts were quick to respond. The Autistic Self Advocacy Network said the study could be biased and designed to match pre-existing beliefs held by Kennedy and President Donald Trump, reported news agency AFP. The network accused the health department of planning “fraudulent research.”Medical experts stressed that autism is not a result of vaccination. Hugo Peyre, a child psychiatrist in France, said Kennedy’s comments show a clear lack of understanding of the scientific evidence.""Nearly 200 genes have been associated with autism, and approximately 80 percent of autism cases can be linked to genetic mutations,"" Thomas Bourgeron, head of the human genetics and cognitive functions lab at France's Pasteur Institute, told AFP.According to WHO, around one percent of children are currently diagnosed with autism, a number that has grown over time mostly due to improved awareness and broader diagnostic criteria.Experts say calling it an “epidemic” is misleading. They warn that pushing discredited theories could reduce vaccination rates and harm public health. During a recent measles outbreak in the US, most of the patients were unvaccinated.

Trump's nominee Caine approved as top US military leader amid partisan battle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-nominee-caine-approved-as-top-us-military-leader-amid-partisan-battle/articleshow/120221673.cms,"Lt. Gen. John Caine (Retired) (AP Photo)

On Friday, the Senate confirmed retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Dan “Razin” Caine as the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , nearly two months after President Donald Trump dismissed his predecessor.Trump nominated Caine for the position in February, following the abrupt firing of Gen. CQ Brown Jr. , who had served as chairman and was the second Black general to hold the role. The dismissal was part of the administration’s broader efforts to remove military leaders who supported diversity and equity initiatives within the ranks. The confirmation vote for Caine passed with a 60-25 tally in the Senate, just before lawmakers left for a two-week recess.A highly decorated F-16 pilot, Caine has held leadership roles in several special operations commands and some of the Pentagon’s most classified operations. He has also worked with the CIA. However, Caine does not meet the usual qualifications set by the 1986 law for the position, such as being a combatant commander or a service chief. These prerequisites can be waived by the president if deemed necessary for national security interests.The confirmation vote, which took place in the early morning hours before the Senate's recess, highlighted the partisan divide over Trump’s appointments. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., organized the expedited vote after Senate Democrats pushed back against speeding up the process.Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York opposed Caine’s confirmation, expressing his continued outrage over the firing of Gen. Brown. He stated, “I remain outraged"" about Brown's dismissal, and voiced skepticism about Trump’s motivations in nominating Caine. Schumer added, “General Caine has served our nation with distinction in the Air Force and Air National Guard, including over multiple combat deployments. Now, as our nation’s top military advisor, I hope he will continue to fight for the needs of our servicemembers, speak truth to power, and resist Donald Trump when he’s wrong.”Despite the opposition, the vote was bipartisan, with 15 Democrats and Independent Senator Angus King of Maine voting in favor of Caine’s appointment.At his confirmation hearing earlier this month, Caine pledged to offer candid and apolitical advice to Trump. He also denied the president's claim that Caine wore a “Make America Great Again” hat when they first met, saying, “I have never worn any political merchandise.”When asked how he would respond if ordered to carry out a potentially illegal directive, such as using the military against civilians for domestic law enforcement, Caine emphasized that it was his responsibility to resist such orders. He stated, “It is the duty and the job that I have to push back.”Trump and Caine’s relationship dates back to the president’s first term. They first met during a trip to Iraq, and Trump has referred to Caine as “a real general, not a television general” in a 2019 speech.The relationship between Trump and his previous Joint Chiefs Chairman, Gen. Mark Milley, deteriorated as Milley took steps to prevent the politicization of the office. Milley notably reminded military personnel that their oath was to the Constitution, not to the president. Following Trump’s inauguration, Milley’s portrait was removed from the Pentagon, and his security clearance and detail were revoked.","Retired Air Force Lt. Gen.

Trump speaks to reporters aboard Air Force One | Tariff | China | Florida | Trade | Iran

US President Donald Trump said Friday that Iran’s vulnerabilities—after months of domestic unrest, international sanctions, and military setbacks—could make it more open to discussions. He says diplomacy is his preferred path, though he warned Iran would face ""great danger"" if talks fail.Speaking aboard Air Force One, Trump said he wants Iran to be “a wonderful, great, happy country” but repeated that the Islamic Republic must never obtain a nuclear weapon.Talks are set to begin in Oman’s capital, Muscat, where Trump’s middle east envoy Steve Witkoff and Iran’s deputy foreign minister Abbas Araghchi will be present. It remains unclear whether the discussions will be face-to-face or indirect, as Iran has insisted that only mediated talks are on the table.The talks come at a moment when Iran is facing enormous challenges. Its proxy groups—Hamas and Hezbollah—have suffered setbacks from Israeli strikes. Iran-backed Houthi militants in Yemen have also been targeted by US airstrikes. Israel has attacked Iranian military sites, including nuclear-linked facilities. In Syria, President Bashar al-Assad, one of Tehran’s closest allies, was removed from power in December.Domestically, Iran’s economy remains under pressure from years of sanctions, and the US treasury added new ones just this week. Still, Iran continues to enrich uranium well beyond the limits set by the 2015 nuclear deal, and experts warn it has enough material for several nuclear weapons.Trump says he wants full dismantlement of Iran’s nuclear capabilities, but both he and his advisers have signalled flexibility. While Israel’s Prime Minister Netanyahu is calling for a Libya-style deal, Trump appears to prefer a more focused agreement—one that stops Iran from weaponising its nuclear material, without necessarily ending the entire programme.","Talks are set to begin in Oman’s capital, Muscat.

Maine Gov. Janet Mills Clashes With Trump: ‘See You in Court’ | WSJ News

A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration must immediately lift its freeze on federal funding to Maine, ordering the USDA to release any withheld funds to the state.The ruling demands that the USDA ""must immediately unfreeze and release to the state of Maine any federal funding that they have frozen or failed or refused to pay because of the state of Maine's alleged failure to comply with the requirements of Title IX.""The judge also stated that the administration is “barred from freezing, terminating, or otherwise interfering with the state of Maine’s future federal funding for alleged violations of Title IX without complying with the legally required procedure,” reported Fox News.This decision comes after the USDA announced a freeze on federal funding to Maine earlier this month. The freeze followed the state’s refusal to comply with President Donald Trump's February executive order that sought to ban transgender athletes from participating in girls’ and women’s sports. Maine’s refusal to adhere to the order put it at odds with the federal government, leading to immense pressure from Washington. Trump had warned in a February 20 speech that the state could lose federal funding if it defied the order.In response to the freeze, Maine filed a lawsuit against the USDA on Monday. The state argued that the funding being withheld was crucial for providing essential services, including meals for children in schools, childcare centers, and after-school programs, as well as for disabled adults in congregate settings. The judge concurred with this argument, acknowledging that the freeze, though linked to Title IX violations, had ""restricted"" the ability to ""provid[e] meals to children and vulnerable adults.""Maine's relationship with the federal government has been under intense scrutiny, and local leaders are continuing to push back. Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) recently called for a resolution of the conflict, stressing her commitment to securing federal funding for the state. While Collins has shown support for the state’s stance on trans athletes in women’s sports, she remains adamant that the issue should be addressed without sacrificing essential services.The Department of Education has also launched its own investigation into Maine's handling of the issue. The US Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) referred the Maine Department of Education (MDOE) to the Department of Justice last Friday for allowing transgender athletes to compete in girls’ sports.This marks the second referral from the Department of Justice concerning Maine’s policies on this issue, following a March 28 referral from the Department of Health and Human Services, which also included the Maine Principals' Association and Greely High School.The controversy surrounding the inclusion of transgender athletes in Maine schools was brought to light when Maine state Representative Laurel Libby posted on social media about a transgender athlete who won a girls' pole vault competition at Greely High School in February. The post sparked backlash from the state's Democratic leadership, resulting in Libby being censured by Speaker Ryan Fecteau and the Democratic majority. As a result, she has faced restrictions on her ability to carry out legislative actions to serve her constituents.",The USDA announced a freeze on federal funding to Maine earlier this month.

FULL: President Trump hosts cabinet meeting at White House w/ Elon Musk, RFK Jr, Tulsi Gabbard

United States President Donald Trump presided over a highly publicised Cabinet meeting at the White House on April 19, where Cabinet members delivered updates on key policy initiatives.The meeting, which allowed press access, delved into transparency and featured a range of announcements impacting economic, security, and health sectors.President Trump opened the meeting by highlighting a significant economic uptick, claiming the US is generating approximately $2 billion daily through tariffs. He also noted a drop in consumer prices, particularly in energy, signaling relief for Americans amid ongoing tariff negotiations. The Department of Commerce, led by Secretary Howard Lutnick, echoed this focus, announcing progress on tariff deals and teasing the upcoming launch of a ""Gold Card"" initiative, though details remain sparse.Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth reported on his recent trip to Panama, where he signed agreements to secure the Panama Canal and ensure free passage for US vessels. This move follows President Trump’s earlier threats to retake control of the canal, citing concerns over Chinese influence and high usage fees. According to an AP News report from April 5, 2025, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate has since sold its stake in canal-adjacent ports to a US-led consortium, aligning with the administration’s push for American dominance in the region.Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard made a bombshell announcement, revealing evidence that electronic voting machines are vulnerable to hacking and manipulation, a concern long raised by election experts. Gabbard emphasized the need for paper ballots to restore voter confidence, aligning with a recent executive order mandating their use.Her office is also working on declassifying documents related to the assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr., with over 100 staff members scanning records for release in the coming days, as part of a broader push for transparency in the intelligence community.The meeting spotlighted significant fiscal adjustments, with the EPA, under administrator Lee Zeldin, canceling $22 billion in grants—a move criticized by Democrats as illegal, per a Philadelphia Sunday Sun report from April 7, 2025. The Department of Labor, led by Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer, returned $4.4 billion in unused Covid funds to the Treasury, citing widespread fraud, including payments to ineligible recipients like 25,000 individuals over 115 years old.Additionally, Elon Musk, in his role with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), claimed a $150 billion reduction in government waste, a figure that has sparked debate over its accuracy, as noted in a PBS report from February 26, 2025.Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem announced a second consecutive month of record-low border crossings, attributing the success to tightened security measures. She outlined plans to work with undocumented immigrants to encourage voluntary departure with the option to return legally, alongside initiatives to support farmers with legal migrant labor. Noem also confirmed that Real ID will be required for domestic air travel starting next month, a policy shift aimed at enhancing national security.Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. unveiled a slew of health-focused initiatives, including a reassessment of fluoride in drinking water — despite its proven benefits in reducing cavities, as noted by the CDC. Kennedy also committed to identifying the cause of rising autism rates by September 2025, a claim that has drawn skepticism given the scientific consensus rejecting vaccine-autism links (CDC, 2023).Meanwhile, Secretary of Education Linda McMahon addressed anti-Semitism on college campuses and announced the withholding of $400 million from Columbia University and $8 billion from Harvard, as part of a broader push to return education oversight to states.","US President Donald Trump hosted a cabinet meeting at the White House on April 19.

"Tesla Supercharger arsonist may have 'shrapnel injuries' from blast, says FBI",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tesla-supercharger-arsonist-may-have-shrapnel-injuries-from-blast-says-fbi/articleshow/120222133.cms,"File photo

Federal authorities are on the lookout for a masked individual suspected of setting a fire at a Tesla Supercharger hub in Washington state, according to the FBI’s Seattle division. Surveillance footage, recently made public, shows the man at the scene during the early hours of Tuesday morning.The blaze erupted around 1:30 a.m. at the South Sound Center in Lacey, a retail area housing several major stores including Target and Kohl’s. Police said they received multiple 911 calls from nearby residents who reported a loud noise echoing through the area.In a statement released later that day, Lacey police confirmed that the fire caused “substantial damage to the station and surrounding area.”The FBI suspects the man involved could have suffered injuries due to his close proximity to what they referred to as “an explosion or intense heat,” noting possible signs of “a concussion, burns, or shrapnel injuries.” Officials did not definitively link the fire to an explosion but highlighted the possibility given the scene’s condition.Authorities described the suspect as a White male, estimated to be between 5'10"" and 6'2"". He was seen wearing a hooded dark jacket, gray pants, and a face covering. Surveillance video also captured him with a white bag—possibly plastic—and walking with what investigators referred to as a “unique gait.” He appears to have a limp in his right leg, which kicks outward, and at times, he holds his right hand behind his back.In an effort to track his movements, the FBI is asking the public—particularly those in the vicinity of the Chehalis Western and Woodland Creek trails—to check any doorbell or security footage from Monday night through Tuesday morning. Authorities are especially interested in footage that could reveal the suspect entering a vehicle after the incident.The incident is part of a wider pattern. Since January, Tesla properties—including dealerships and charging stations—have reportedly been targeted in at least nine US states. These attacks range from vandalism and gunfire to suspected arson, according to a federal alert issued earlier this month.The motivation behind the recent uptick in attacks appears to be politically charged. Public backlash intensified after President Donald Trump named Tesla CEO Elon Musk as a policy advisor to his newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), an appointment that stirred controversy nationwide.While Tesla and Target have yet to release official statements on the Lacey incident, federal investigators continue to pursue leads in what is quickly shaping up to be a coordinated campaign of anti-Tesla activity .",The FBI is looking for a man suspected of setting a fire at a Tesla Supercharger hub in Washington state.

US pastor kidnapped at gunpoint while preaching in South Africa,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-pastor-kidnapped-at-gunpoint-while-preaching-in-south-africa/articleshow/120221741.cms,"Representative photo

Authorities in South Africa are searching for American missionary Pastor Josh Sullivan after he was forcibly taken by armed men during a church service near the coastal city of Gqeberha on Thursday night.Sullivan, who was preaching at the Fellowship Baptist Church in Motherwell, was abducted at gunpoint in front of roughly 30 congregants, including his wife and six children, according to a fellow pastor, Rev. Jeremy Hall. “They knew him by name,” Hall told AFP, suggesting the abduction was likely “financially related.”Local police said four masked and armed suspects stormed into the church during the sermon, robbed two cellphones, and “then took the 45-year-old male pastor with them and fled the scene.” Sullivan was forced into his own car, which was later discovered abandoned about a mile away.Kidnappings, often carried out by criminal gangs seeking ransoms, have seen a sharp rise in South Africa in recent years. Official police statistics report over 17,000 kidnappings across the country in the 2023-2024 financial year—an 11 percent increase from the previous year.Pastor Sullivan has been living in South Africa since 2018 after relocating from Tennessee. On his personal blog, he had written, “We are looking to finish language school soon and plant a church to the Xhosa speaking people.” Prior to that, he had served on staff at Fellowship Baptist Church in Maryville, Tennessee, since February 2012.The US State Department acknowledged awareness of an American citizen’s abduction in South Africa, though further details were not disclosed.Police spokesperson Captain Andre Beetge noted that if a ransom is officially demanded, the case would be turned over to the Hawks, a specialized police unit focused on organized and economic crimes. “As I understand, there has been no ransom raised,” Beetge said, urging the public to come forward with any information.Back in the United States, Sullivan’s home church called for prayers in a Facebook post: “Please pray for Josh Sullivan, missionary to South Africa.” Messages of support also poured in across social media.“We are now praying that you delivered from these evil men,” Richard Stockton wrote on the church website. “Praying the Holy Spirit well work on their hearts and be saved. And release you!!!”“Josh is a faithful brother doing much to make Christ known in Africa,” tweeted Kody Moore on X. “Please pray for Josh to be brought home safely and especially his family during this absolutely terrible time. May Christ be magnified.”Meanwhile, the region has seen other kidnapping incidents as well. Just days earlier, a Chinese national was reportedly abducted in the same city. South Africa continues to struggle with rampant gun violence, with 33 people losing their lives to firearms daily, according to Gun Free South Africa, an anti-gun violence nonprofit.As the investigation unfolds, law enforcement agencies are working urgently to locate Sullivan and secure his safe return.","Pastor Josh Sullivan was forcibly taken by armed men during a church service in South Africa.

'I got every answer right!' Trump claims perfect score on cognitive exam,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/i-got-every-answer-right-trump-claims-perfect-score-on-cognitive-exam/articleshow/120221532.cms,"US President Donald Trump (File photo)

President Donald Trump confidently told reporters he “got every answer right” during his cognitive test as part of his annual physical at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Friday. Speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump shared that he believed he performed well on the exam and expected the full results to be released on Sunday.""I have never felt better, but nevertheless, these things must be done!"" Trump wrote on Truth Social earlier in the week. This physical exam was the first of his second term, and he boarded Air Force One for Florida shortly after spending about five hours at the hospital.Despite his positive assessment, Trump did not offer many specifics about the test or his health, maintaining an air of privacy regarding the details. The public has not been given a detailed view of Trump's health since his 2018 evaluation, and during the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump refrained from offering health updates, even though he had previously promised to do so.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Friday that the president’s physician would release an update on the physical report ""in the effort of transparency,"" aiming to provide ""as many results as possible"" and to share them ""as soon as we possibly can.""The tradition of sharing the results of such exams typically involves a narrative of the president's physical fitness, but it has never included a full and transparent release of medical records. In his 2018 evaluation, then-White House physician Dr. Ronny Jackson reported that Trump was in “excellent” cardiovascular health for his age, despite being considered “overweight” based on his body mass index (BMI). Trump’s cholesterol levels were noted to be higher than recommended, with his LDL cholesterol at 143 and total cholesterol at 223, compared to the ideal threshold of 200. His BMI, calculated at 29.9, was just shy of the obesity classification, which begins at 30.Trump’s medical history was otherwise relatively unremarkable, with Jackson noting the president’s use of rosuvastatin to manage his cholesterol and finasteride for male-pattern hair loss. The report also mentioned that Trump takes aspirin daily to help prevent heart disease, a multivitamin, and applies ivermectin cream as needed for rosacea, a benign skin condition.In line with his own request, Trump’s physician conducted a Montreal Cognitive Assessment during the 2018 evaluation. Jackson reported that Trump scored a perfect 30/30 on the test.Trump’s health took a notable turn in October 2020 when he was hospitalized after testing positive for Covid-19. According to sources close to the situation, the president experienced a fever, a rapid drop in blood oxygen levels, and difficulty breathing, which led to his receiving supplemental oxygen. Doctors treated Trump with a combination of monoclonal antibodies and steroids, and he returned to the White House after three days in the hospital.As Trump continues his second term, the US awaits more information on the results of his physical and the upcoming full report.","President Donald Trump underwent his annual physical exam at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Friday.

Supreme Court: Trump admin must return man deported in error | LiveNOW from FOX

Supreme Court pauses order mandating return of Maryland man deported to El Salvador

A federal judge has sharply criticized the Trump administration for failing to take any discernible action to secure the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident wrongfully deported to El Salvador. The strong rebuke came during a Friday hearing in a Maryland district court, a day after the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously upheld an earlier directive that the administration ""facilitate"" his return to the United States.Judge Paula Xinis , appointed by former President Barack Obama, expressed frustration over the lack of progress, pressing the government for clarity on Garcia’s whereabouts and the steps—if any—taken to bring him back. “Where is [Abrego Garcia] and under whose authority?” she asked Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign, emphasizing that she was “not asking for state secrets.”The government maintains that Garcia is currently being held at El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center , known as CECOT, where he has reportedly been detained since March 15. However, Ensign admitted he had no specific information on what, if anything, had been done to comply with the court’s order. “That is extremely troubling,” Judge Xinis remarked, following up with: “Have they done anything?”When Ensign said he was unaware of any efforts, Xinis concluded, “So that means they’ve done nothing. Despite this court’s clear directive, your clients have done nothing to facilitate the return of Mr. Abrego Garcia.”Though the Supreme Court sided with Judge Xinis in declaring Garcia’s removal to El Salvador “illegal” because of a withholding order that explicitly barred his deportation there, it left the logistics of his return to the district court. Xinis is now tasked with defining how the government should “effectuate” that return.The administration, meanwhile, argued that the court’s expectations were unreasonable given the sensitive diplomatic dimensions involved. “Foreign affairs cannot operate on judicial timelines, in part because it involves sensitive country-specific considerations wholly inappropriate for judicial review,” the Justice Department said in a court filing. The filing also argued that Xinis “has not yet clarified what it means to ‘facilitate’ or ‘effectuate’ the return as it relates to this case, as Plaintiff is in the custody of a foreign sovereign.”Ensign stressed during the hearing that multiple U.S. Cabinet-level agencies are involved in the matter and coordination is ongoing. “The Trump administration was actively considering what could be done,” he said. But Xinis was unimpressed, stating plainly: “I guess my message, for what it’s worth, is: if you can do it, do it tomorrow.”Adding to tensions, the administration failed to meet two court-imposed deadlines—9:30 a.m. and 11:30 a.m.—to submit Garcia’s status updates ahead of the Friday hearing. DOJ attorneys said in a letter that the court’s expectations were unrealistic given the Supreme Court’s ruling just hours prior. “Defendants are unable to provide the information requested by the Court on the impracticable deadline set by the Court hours after the Supreme Court issued its order,” they wrote.The Trump administration has acknowledged that Garcia’s deportation, which occurred after his March 12 arrest, was the result of an “administrative error.” However, officials have also labeled him a threat, asserting that Garcia is “a member of a foreign terrorist organization.” According to their claims, he was “confirmed to be a ranking member of the MS-13 gang by a proven and reliable source” and had entered the U.S. unlawfully in 2011.Garcia’s legal team and family have strongly denied any gang affiliations. They say that since 2006, he has been targeted and threatened by gang members in Central America, who have tried to extort money from his parents by threatening to abduct or kill him.El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele is expected to visit Washington on Monday for a meeting with President Trump. The situation involving Abrego Garcia is anticipated to be a point of discussion during the diplomatic visit.","A federal judge has sharply criticized the Trump administration for failing to secure the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia.

The White House on Friday swapped the portrait of former US President Barack Obama from a prominent spot in the foyer of the State Floor with a new painting of US President Donald Trump, depicting the dramatic aftermath of the assassination attempt on him last summer.According to news agency AP, the decision, made without public notice, has again highlighted Trump’s break with long-standing White House traditions.The painting, by artist Marc Lipp, captures the moment Trump raised his fist and shouted “fight, fight, fight!” after being grazed by a bullet during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania in July 2024, a phrase that went on to become a defining slogan of his reelection bid.The White House unveiled the painting on X with the caption “Some new artwork at the White House” and an emoji of eyes.According to the AP, the work was donated by school safety advocate Andrew Pollack via the Blue Gallery in Delray Beach, Florida. Pollack's daughter Meadow, was one of the victims of the 2018 Parkland school shooting and he has since become a prominent voice on gun safety.Obama’s portrait, which was unveiled at the White House in 2022 during an event hosted by then-US President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden, hasn’t been removed entirely but has been relocated to a different wall where George W Bush’s portrait once hung. The Bush portrait will reportedly be moved closer to that of his father, George HW Bush, near the staircase to the presidential residence.By tradition, the White House foyer displays the portraits of the two most recent former presidents. Trump, having now served two non-consecutive terms, is in the unusual position of being both a current and former president, complicating the usual rotation. Still, replacing a predecessor’s portrait with one’s own is considered a significant departure from protocol.As per AP, portrait unveilings have traditionally been bipartisan and gracious affairs. George W Bush hosted Bill Clinton for his unveiling and Barack Obama welcomed Bush and his wife, Laura in 2012.Trump, however, declined to host the Obamas during his first term, breaking with that tradition. It wasn’t until Biden returned to office that the Obamas were welcomed back to the White House for their portrait ceremony.Friday’s unexpected switch comes just a month after Trump objected to a painting of him displayed in the Colorado state Capitol, claiming it was “purposefully distorted.” That portrait was later removed following his complaint.The White House portrait collection, which begins with George Washington, has grown over centuries. Some of the earliest artworks were gifts, but since the 1960s, the White House Historical Association, founded by Jacqueline Kennedy, has funded most presidential and first lady portraits.Not all portraits are always on display; some are in storage or undergoing conservation, according to Stewart McLaurin, president of the association.","The White House on Friday swapped the portrait of former US President Barack Obama from a prominent spot in the foyer of the State Floor with a new painting of US President Donald Trump.

Lawyers for Luigi Mangione , the man accused of fatally shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in a shocking daylight attack in December 2024, are urging a federal judge to block the Trump administration from pursuing the death penalty , calling it a "" political stunt "" motivated by the president’s crime agenda.According to news agency AFP, in a court filing submitted Friday in Manhattan federal court , Mangione’s defence team sharply criticised attorney general Pam Bondi , who earlier this month directed federal prosecutors to seek capital punishment in the high-profile case.Bondi labelled the killing “an act of political violence” and claimed it aligned with US President Donald Trump’s pledge to “Make America Safe Again” by cracking down on violent crime.Mangione's lawyers argued the government had disregarded standard procedures for seeking the death penalty and accused Bondi of weaponising the justice system for political gain.“The United States government intends to kill Mr. Mangione as a political stunt,” they wrote in the filing, according to The Hill. They also said the attorney general’s “explicitly and unapologetically political” decision prejudiced the grand jury process and undermined their client’s due process rights.Mangione, a 26-year-old University of Pennsylvania graduate, allegedly travelled from Atlanta to New York City and stalked Thompson before shooting him outside a Hilton Hotel on December 4.The CEO was reportedly attending an investor event hosted by UnitedHealth Group. Federal prosecutors said the suspect used a pistol with a silencer and fled the scene. He was captured five days later at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, after a staff tip.He has been charged in both New York state and federal court. While he has pleaded not guilty in the state case, where the maximum sentence is life without parole, he has yet to enter a plea in the federal case.A grand jury indictment is still pending. According to CNBC, he faces federal charges including murder, stalking and firearms offences.Mangione’s lawyers claim the attorney general's office failed to allow the defence time to present a mitigation submission, a routine step in federal death penalty cases. “Mr. Mangione’s counsel asked for three months to prepare a fulsome mitigation submission… and was ignored,” they stated.They further challenged Bondi’s decision-making process, suggesting it was driven solely by presidential priorities. “Ultimately, any mitigation would have fallen on deaf ears in any event, as the Attorney General was plainly concerned only with ‘the President’s directive,’” the filing read, according to The Hill.Public sentiment over the case has been sharply divided. While the murder shocked many, some social media users have portrayed Mangione as a symbol of anger over America's private health care system. Thompson's killing sparked widespread debate, with Bondi stressing that it “may have posed grave risk of death to additional persons,” according to AFP.The defence has now requested that all internal and external communications regarding the death penalty decision be turned over, alleging the process has been irreparably compromised.",Luigi Mangione is accused of shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.

‘Not asking for state secrets’: Judge orders daily updates as Trump administration struggles to locate wrongfully deported man,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/not-asking-for-state-secrets-judge-orders-daily-updates-as-trump-administration-struggles-to-locate-wrongfully-deported-man/articleshow/120217479.cms,"File photo: US President Donald Trump (left) and Kilmar Abrego Garcia (Picture credit: AP)

A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to provide daily updates on efforts to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia , a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador, after a tense hearing in which justice department lawyers admitted they could not say where he was or what steps were being taken to bring him back.US district judge Paula Xinis issued the order Friday after slamming the administration’s handling of the case, calling the justice department’s inability to provide even basic information “extremely troubling.” “I’m not asking for state secrets,” she said during the hearing, as quoted by CBS News. “I’m asking a very simple question: where is he?”, Xinis asked.The 29-year-old was deported in March despite having protected legal status due to a 2019 court ruling that barred his removal to El Salvador.A US immigration official later admitted in court that Abrego Garcia’s removal had been an “administrative error.” He was sent to CECOT, a notorious Salvadoran prison, under a $6 million detention agreement between the Trump administration and President Nayib Bukele’s government.On Thursday, the US Supreme Court upheld Judge Xinis’ order requiring the administration to “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s release and ensure his case is handled as it would have been had he not been wrongly deported. But the justice department claimed the judge’s deadline to provide details by 9:30 am (local time) Friday was “impracticable” and sought a delay until next week.Judge Xinis rejected the request, extending the deadline by just two hours and pressing ahead with a scheduled afternoon hearing. During that session, justice department attorney Drew Ensign told the court that he did not have information on Abrego Garcia’s physical location or custodial status, prompting Judge Xinis to remark, “That means they’ve done nothing,” ABC News reported.In a filing, the justice department argued that “foreign affairs cannot operate on judicial timelines,” and insisted it could not provide potential next steps before they had been vetted, adding that the situation involved “sensitive country-specific considerations” inappropriate for court review.But the judge was unconvinced, saying that the record showed “your clients have done nothing to facilitate” his return.She ordered that updates must now be submitted daily by an official with direct knowledge of the case.Abrego Garcia’s attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, accused the government of “playing games” and said the lack of answers about his client’s whereabouts was “terrifying.”“Fortunately,” he added, “the judge put an end to that” by demanding accountability from officials involved in the case.While the Supreme Court acknowledged the executive branch’s primacy in foreign affairs, it also directed the administration to explain what steps it has taken or will take, reinforcing that the deportation was unlawful and required correction.The case has emerged as a flashpoint in Trump’s broader immigration crackdown, highlighting the tension between federal courts and the executive branch on questions of due process and presidential power.Judge Xinis made clear the government would now be closely watched and said, “We’re going to make a record of what, if anything, the government is doing or not doing”, reported ABC News.",US district judge Paula Xinis issued the order Friday after slamming the administration’s handling of the case.

Pakistan's former Prime Minister Imran Khan is prepared to engage in reconciliation discussions with the government or any institution, but cannot be forced into submission at gunpoint, according to Junaid Akbar, who leads the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province .Since August 2023, Khan has been held in Adiala Jail Rawalpindi, confronting numerous cases initiated following his government's removal in April 2022.Akbar, during a press interaction on Thursday, said that Khan has expressed willingness to engage in dialogue with any party to ensure constitutional and legal supremacy , whilst refusing forceful submission.""Our doors are open, but if someone thinks they can force their will upon us by keeping Khan Sahib and our workers in jail and lodging FIRs against us, they are mistaken,"" he said.Akbar stressed the importance of institutions and political parties operating within their legal parameters.""We are ready to uphold the Constitution and law and are open to dialogue with anyone be it the government or institutions,"" he said.""While we may have grievances with the heads of some institutions, we still own and respect these institutions because they are ours,"" he added.Akbar indicated that both institutions and the government have successfully created conditions denying Khan's basic rights.He noted their requests align with standard jail manual provisions.Despite repeated attempts to visit Imran Khan, Akbar reported being made to wait for hours before being denied access.Regarding protests for Khan's release, Akbar stated: ""This is not just an issue for Khan Sahib; it's a national issue.

Poll Should the Pakistani military have a role in politics? No, it undermines democracy. Yes, they provide stability.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s political landscape remains a battleground of competing forces, with the military, former prime minister Imran Khan, and the current govt under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif locked in a tense struggle.The interplay of US foreign policy and the Pakistani diaspora’s growing voice adds further complexity to a nation grappling with economic woes, security threats and democratic erosion.Imran Khan, ousted in April 2022 via a no-confidence vote, continues to challenge the status quo from behind bars. Convicted on corruption and state secret charges, the cricketer-turned-politician retains a fervent base, accusing the military and Sharif’s govt of colluding with the US to orchestrate his downfall.Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) alleges widespread rigging in the Feb 2024 elections, which saw Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) secure power through a fragile coalition. PTI supporters, galvanised by Khan’s claims, have staged protests, clashing with the security forces and deepening the political divide.The military, longtime kingmaker in Pakistani politics, appears to have shifted allegiance. Once Khan’s backer in his 2018 rise, the army soured on him after policy disputes and his public criticisms of General Asim Munir, the current army chief.Analysts suggest the military now props up Sharif’s govt, a dynamic evident in legislative moves like the 2023 Pakistan Army Act amendment, which stifled dissent and empowered the armed forces. This hybrid regime – blending electoral democracy with military influence – has drawn scrutiny for undermining constitutional norms, yet the generals show no sign of relinquishing their grip.However, Shehbaz Sharif, re-elected in March 2024 as PM, faces a legitimacy crisis. His coalition, including the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) and other smaller factions, struggles to address surging militant attacks, crumbling infrastructure, and an economy reliant on IMF bailouts.Sharif vows to mend ties with Washington but his govt’s dependence on military support raises questions about its autonomy. Khan’s call for an election audit, echoed in a letter to the IMF, threatens to derail these efforts as Pakistan awaits a critical loan installment.The US role remains contentious. Khan’s unproven claims of a Washington-led conspiracy resonate with a populace wary of foreign interference, a sentiment rooted in decades of strained relations. The Biden administration, while engaging Sharif’s govt, has maintained robust military ties with Pakistan, prioritising counter-terrorism over democratic concerns. This ambivalence has fuelled Khan’s narrative, even as US officials dismiss his allegations.Meanwhile, the Pakistani diaspora, particularly in the US, has emerged as a vocal force. Pro-democracy activists, many aligned with PTI, have lobbied Congress, securing bipartisan support for resolutions condemning elections irregularities and Khan’s detention. Over 100 lawmakers have urged his release, while some advocate sanctions against military leaders like Munir. This diaspora-driven pressure marks a shift, challenging the traditional US-Pakistan security nexus.As Pakistan teeters between chaos and stability, the military’s shadow looms large, Khan’s defiance endures, and Sharif’s govt navigates a treacherous path. With the US and Pakistani diaspora adding external weight, the nation’s democratic future hangs in the balance.","Imran Khan, ousted in April 2022 via a no-confidence vote, continues to challenge the status quo from behind bars.

"Shutter-down strike, road blockades grip Balochistan as Akhtar Mengal leads protest",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/shutter-down-strike-road-blockades-grip-balochistan-as-akhtar-mengal-leads-protest/articleshow/120080322.cms,"Pakistan's flag

Poll Do you support the call for a long march by Sardar Akhtar Mengal? No, I do not support it. Yes, I support it.

ISLAMABAD: A tense standoff unfolded across Balochistan on Monday as a shutter-down strike and widespread road blockades sparked by nationalist leader Sardar Akhtar Mengal ’s call for a “long march” from Lakpass to Quetta paralysed the Pakistani province.The protest by Akhtar’s Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), now in its second week, demands the release of detained Baloch activists, including women leaders of Balochistan Yakjehti Committee (BYC), amid escalating clashes with authorities.Shops businesses and schools remained closed in cities like Quetta, Kalat, Mastung Khuzdar, and Gwadar. Mengal’s supporters blocked key highways, including the Quetta-Karachi national highway.The provincial govt’s deployment of containers, trenches, and police checkpoints at Lakpass, roughly 30 km from Quetta, stalled the march, forcing demonstrators onto rugged mountain routes.Reports of police using teargas and shelling BNP-M workers have intensified the unrest.Mengal, addressing a sit-in at Lakpass, accused the state of oppression and vowed to press forward. “The state may crush us, but we won’t bow,” he declared, signalling plans to escalate the march into province-wide resistance. The protest began March 28 in Wadh, Mengal’s hometown, following the arrest of BYC leaders, including Mahrang Baloch, during a crackdown on their Quetta sit-in. A suicide bombing near the rally on March 29 left Mengal unharmed but underscored the volatile stakes.Balochistan’s govt, led by chief minister Sarfraz Bugti, has taken a hard line. His spokesperson, Shahid Rind, warned Mengal of arrest under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) Act if the march entered Quetta’s Red Zone.Negotiations have faltered, with Mengal dismissing the provincial govt’s delegations as powerless to meet demands. BYC, however, rallied behind Mengal, urging highway blockades and strikes to amplify pressure.Analysts see it as a critical juncture for Balochistan, where grievances over state repression, enforced disappearances and resource exploitation fuel dissent. The shutter-down has disrupted public life, with Quetta’s land links to 12 districts severed for over a week. With cellular networks down and security tightened, the province braces for what Mengal’s supporters call a defining fight.","The protest by Akhtar’s Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), now in its second week, demands the release of detained Baloch activists.

Pakistan: Militants make March deadliest month in a decade,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-militants-make-march-deadliest-month-in-a-decade/articleshow/119976734.cms,"(PTI photo)

Who are the militant groups?



Poll Do you believe the rise in militant attacks in Pakistan is primarily due to the influence of groups based in Afghanistan? No, not at all Yes, definitely

Which are the most affected regions?



What are the consequences of the rising violence?



More than 100 deadly attacks in Pakistan by Islamist militants and separatist rebels made March the deadliest month over a decade with 335 people killed, a think tank reported Thursday.Of the deaths, 228 were caused by militant groups, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) think tank. They included 73 members of security services, including soldiers and police officers, 67 civilians and 88 militants.The Islamist-militant Pakistani Taliban, or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and the separatist rebel Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) were the main militant groups responsible for the attacks.The BLA was responsible for a 28-hour hijacking of the train Jaffar Express in the southwestern region Balochistan. Some 450 people were held hostage and more than two dozen were killed.Balochistan was the most affected province, followed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the northwest of Pakistan.They have both also been targets of suicide bombings, a form of attacks that surged in March.In Punjab, the eastern province bordering India, the think tank observed a strong increase in militant activity.At least seven attacks were recorded, and most were attributed to the TTP.In response to the growing threat, Pakistan's security forces have intensified their operations in the region. Many people have been arrested with connections to militant groups, including the TTP.Islamabad claims that most attacks, both by militants and rebels, are planned and executed from Afghanistan. It accuses the neighboring country of granting Pakistani militants space to plan and organize attacks.A recent report by the United Nations supported this claim. It said that the Taliban provided support to the TTP and that some attacks were launched from Afghan territory.As a consequence, the Pakistani government has urged the ruling Taliban in Afghanistan to act against the allegedly responsible criminals. Kabul, on the other hand, denies that the militants are in Afghanistan.","Of the deaths, 228 were caused by militant groups, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.
