'Let Them Decide': Trump At Oval Office When Asked About NOBEL PRIZE After Gaza Deal

Will Trump get the Peace Prize?

Who are the contenders?







The Norwegian Nobel Committee will announce the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday. The award is considered one of the most anticipated and unpredictable honours.Experts say the committee usually focuses on lasting peace, international cooperation, and the work of institutions that promote these goals.The announcement will be made in Oslo, Norway, where the committee will name the laureate who reflects the values of Alfred Nobel, the 19th-century Swedish industrialist who founded the prize.There has been speculation about the possibility of US President Donald Trump winning the prize, a discussion partly driven by Trump himself. However, experts who follow the Nobel process say his chances are low despite his involvement in several international peace efforts.The announcement comes just hours after Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire and hostage release deal that could help end the two-year conflict in Gaza.While Trump has claimed credit for pressuring both sides to reach the deal, the timing makes it unlikely that the Nobel Committee considered it.The five-member committee held its final meeting on Monday, when it completed the statement explaining its choice, which is usually decided days in advance.""The Gaza deal has absolutely no significance for the choice of the 2025 laureate because the Nobel Committee has already made its decision,"" historian and Peace Prize expert Asle Sveen told news agency AFP.""Trump will not win the prize this year. I’m 100 percent certain,"" he said.A total of 338 individuals and organisations have been nominated for the 2025 Peace Prize, but the list remains secret for 50 years. With no clear favourite, several possible names are being discussed in Oslo.Among them are Sudan’s Emergency Response Rooms, a network of volunteers helping civilians during war and famine; Yulia Navalnaya, widow of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny; and the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, which monitors elections.The committee could also choose a laureate that signals its position on global issues, even if it invites criticism from the United States.Possible choices include UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres , the UN refugee agency (UNHCR), the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), or international courts such as the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the International Criminal Court (ICC).Organisations defending press freedom, such as the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) or Reporters Without Borders (RSF), are also being discussed as potential winners.Last year’s prize went to Nihon Hidankyo, an organisation of survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings that campaigns against nuclear weapons.The Nobel Peace Prize includes a diploma, a gold medal, and a $1.2 million cash award.The economics prize, to be announced on Monday, will conclude the 2025 Nobel season, which has already seen awards for medicine, physics, chemistry, literature, and peace.","The Norwegian Nobel Committee will announce the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday.

Afghan Taliban Strikes Pakistan; Heavy Fighting On 7 Border Points Along Durand Line





Afghanistan’s eastern frontier flared up this weekend — a border that has rarely known peace since colonial lines sliced through Pashtun lands. The Taliban , now the state it once fought from the shadows, said its forces launched armed reprisals against Pakistani troops after Islamabad’s alleged air strikes on Afghan soil. From Kunar to Helmand, provinces that have lived on the edge of someone’s war for decades, local officials confirmed that clashes were ongoing.On Saturday, Afghanistan’s Taliban forces launched armed reprisals against Pakistani soldiers along the shared border, accusing Islamabad of carrying out air strikes on its soil, senior officials from several provinces said.“In retaliation for the air strikes by Pakistani forces,” Taliban border forces in the east “engaged in heavy clashes against Pakistani forces’ posts in various border areas,” the Afghan military said in a statement, quoted by AFP.On Thursday, two explosions were heard in the Afghan capital and another in the southeast of the country. The following day, the Taliban-run defence ministry blamed the attacks on Pakistan , accusing its neighbor of ""violating its sovereignty.""Later, Taliban defence ministry spokesman Enayat Khowarazm told news agency AFP that the operations had concluded ""successfully"" at midnight.He added a warning: ""If the opposing side again violates Afghanistan’s territory, our armed forces are prepared to defend it and will respond decisively.""Islamabad did not confirm that it was behind the attacks, but called on Kabul ""to stop harbouring the Pakistani Taliban (TTP) on its soil."" The TTP, trained in combat in Afghanistan and claiming to share the same ideology as the Afghan Taliban, is accused by Islamabad of having killed hundreds of its soldiers since 2021.""This evening, Taliban forces began using weapons. We fired first light and then heavy artillery at four points along the border,"" a senior official in Pakistan's Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, bordering Afghanistan, told AFP.""Pakistani forces responded with heavy fire and shot down three Afghan quadcopters suspected of carrying explosives. Intense fighting continues, but so far, no casualties have been reported,"" he continued.In recent months, TTP militants have intensified their campaign of violence against Pakistani security forces in the mountainous areas along the border.Islamabad accuses Afghanistan of failing to expel militants who use Afghan territory to launch attacks on Pakistan, an accusation denied by authorities in Kabul.","Afghan Taliban forces launch armed reprisals against Pakistani soldiers along the shared border.

Taliban foreign minister visits Darul Uloom Deoband in UP. What’s the seminary's connection to Afghanistan?

What is Darul Uloom Deoband?



The Afghan connection: How Deobandi Islam reached Afghanistan



NEW DELHI: Taliban ’s foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi visited the Darul Uloom Deoband in Saharanpur on Saturday, meeting Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind President Maulana Arshad Madani and other senior officials of the seminary.Muttaqi expressed gratitude for the warm reception and optimism about India-Afghanistan ties. “I am thankful to all of you for the warm welcome given to me by everyone in Deoband and the love showered upon me. I will pray to God that India-Afghanistan relations improve further,” he said, as quoted by news agency ANI.The Afghan leader highlighted the significance of educational and cultural ties, noting that no political discussions took place but that historical connections were celebrated.As per news agency ANI, Maulana Arshad Madani emphasised the historical role of Afghanistan in India’s independence struggle and reassured that Afghanistan would not allow terrorists to use its soil against India.This visit is part of a week-long trip to India by Muttaqi, marking the first high-level delegation from Kabul since the Taliban took power in 2021.Darul Uloom Deoband, established in 1866 in present-day Uttar Pradesh, is one of South Asia’s most influential Islamic seminaries.It was founded by scholars including Maulana Muhammad Qasim Nanautawi and Maulana Rashid Muhammad Gangohi to educate Muslim youth in a rigorous, orthodox understanding of Islam, known as Deobandi Islam.The seminary was originally part of an anti-colonial movement aimed at revitalising Islam and resisting British rule in India. Over the decades, Deobandi schools spread throughout India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and other parts of South Asia.While Darul Uloom Deoband is in India, its teachings spread across the border into Pakistan and Afghanistan. Pashtun communities were instrumental in establishing Deobandi seminaries along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, according to The Conversation.The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 accelerated this process as Deobandi madrassas, supported by Pakistani authorities and funding from Saudi Arabia and the CIA, educated Afghan refugee youth who would join the anti-Soviet resistance.Many of these students later became key figures in the Taliban. The movement’s founder, Mullah Mohammad Omar, and other Taliban leaders were educated in Deobandi-inspired seminaries in Pakistan, adopting a version of the ideology that included ultraconservative Wahhabi influences, as per NPR.While the Taliban identify as Deobandis, scholars at the original Indian seminary emphasise that their interpretation diverged from classical Deobandi teachings.“The Taliban say they are doing what we did in India. The way we kicked the British out of India, that’s what the Taliban are doing in Afghanistan,” said Maulana Arshad Madani back in 2021 when the Taliban took control over Afghanistan, clarifying that there is no organisational link between the seminary and the Taliban, as per NPR.This visit of Taliban’s foreign minister comes amid efforts to improve India-Afghanistan relations, as Muttaqi emphasised hopes for increased exchanges and cooperation, including in regional projects like the Chabahar port in Iran.The visit reinforces the soft-power and cultural dimension of diplomacy between the two countries while acknowledging the centuries-old educational and religious links that connect them.",Taliban’s foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi visited the Darul Uloom Deoband in Saharanpur on Saturday.

Taliban presser in New Delhi



NEW DELHI: Rahul Gandhi on Saturday led a wave of opposition outrage after women journalists were barred from a Taliban press conference in New Delhi. Taking direct aim at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Congress MP addressed PM Modi and said, ""you are telling every woman in India that you are too weak to stand up for them. ”The remark came as several opposition leaders condemned the government for allowing such an event, calling it a shameful affront to women’s rights and democratic values.Leader of opposition in Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, voiced his disappointment over the incident and criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi, writing on X, ""Mr. Modi, when you allow the exclusion of women journalists from a public forum, you are telling every woman in India that you are too weak to stand up for them.""He added, ""In our country, women have the right to equal participation in every space. Your silence in the face of such discrimination exposes the emptiness of your slogans on Nari Shakti.""BJP responded sharply to Rahul Gandhi's criticism of the Taliban press conference, denying the allegations and linking him to Pakistan, while calling Congress the ""best friend of Pakistan.""BJP spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari said, ""Yet again Rahul Gandhi is batting for Pakistan by spreading fake news!""He also fact-checked Rahul on X, noting, ""Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, 1961 Article 22 declares embassy land as 'inviolable' and belonging to the embassy.""It was not just Rahul Gandhi, but several other opposition leaders also targeted PM and Centre. Lok Sabha member Priyanka Gandhi also addressed the issue, asking the prime minister to clarify the government’s position. She wrote on X, ""Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji, please clarify your position on the removal of female journalists from the press conference of the representative of the Taliban on his visit to India. ""Priyanka added, ""If your recognition of women’s rights isn’t just convenient posturing from one election to the other, then how has this insult to some of India’s most competent women been allowed in our country, a country whose women are its backbone and its pride.""Former home minister P Chidambaram expressed shock over the exclusion, writing, ""I am shocked that women journalists were excluded from the press conference addressed by Mr Amir Khan Muttaqi of Afghanistan. In my personal view, the men journalists should have walked out when they found that their women colleagues were excluded (or not invited).""TMC MP Mahua Moitra also targeted the Modi-led government, saying, ""The government has dishonoured every single Indian woman by allowing Taliban minister to exclude women journalists from presser. Shameful bunch of spineless hypocrites.""She added in another post on X, ""How dare our government allow Taliban foreign minister Amir Muttaqi to exclude women journalists & hold a ‘male-only’ news conference on Indian soil with full protocol? How dare EAM Jaishankar agree to this? & why did our emasculated spineless male journos remain in room?""The press conference was held at the Afghanistan embassy hours after Taliban FM talks with external affairs minister S Jaishankar, where women journalists were barred from entry. The forum was only opened to a few male journalists, reflecting the Taliban’s ongoing record of gender discrimination.Sources say the decision on journalist invitations was made by Taliban officials accompanying Muttaqi. The Taliban government in Kabul has faced sustained global condemnation, including from the United Nations, for its restrictions on women’s rights, education, and participation in public life.Amid backlash, the ministry of external affairs clarified to ANI that India had ""no involvement"" in the press interaction held by Muttaqi.When asked about the condition of women in Afghanistan, Muttaqi sidestepped the question, saying, ""Every country has its own customs, laws and principles, and there should be respect for them."" He claimed Afghanistan’s situation had improved since the Taliban takeover in August 2021, contrasting current conditions with previous years. ""Some 200 to 400 people died in Afghanistan every day before Taliban started ruling the country,"" he said.","Rahul Gandhi led a wave of opposition outrage after women journalists were barred from a Taliban press conference in New Delhi.

Pakistan Panics After Taliban Issues Warning, Accuses India of Using Afghanistan Soil for Terror

Pakistan has lodged formal objections with Afghanistan’s Ambassador in Islamabad over several ‘elements of the India‑Afghanistan joint statement’, particularly the reference to Jammu and Kashmir as 'part of India'.It also rejected remarks by Afghan foreign minister Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi that “terrorism is an internal problem of Pakistan,” the Pakistani ministry of foreign affairs (MOFA) said.The foreign office said: “It was conveyed that the reference to Jammu and Kashmir as part of India is in clear violation of the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the legal status of Jammu and Kashmir. The Joint Statement is highly insensitive to the sacrifices and sentiments of the people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir in their just struggle for the right to self‑determination.”In addition, Islamabad strongly rebutted Muttaqi’s claim, saying: “Pakistan has repeatedly shared details regarding the presence of Fitna‑e‑Khawarij and Fitna‑e‑Hindustan terrorist elements operating from Afghan soil against Pakistan with support from elements within Afghanistan.”The Pakistani statement added that deflecting responsibility by branding terrorism in Pakistan as an ""internal matter"" does not relieve Afghanistan’s interim government of its duty to ensure regional peace and security.It also urged that “unauthorised Afghan nationals residing in Pakistan” return to their country.These protests follow a joint statement issued on October 10 during Muttaqi’s visit to India, where both nations reiterated condemnation of terrorism emanating from regional countries, affirmed respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, and affirmed that the Afghan government would not permit any group or individual to use Afghan territory against India.In that statement, external affairs minister S Jaishankar expressed gratitude for Afghanistan’s condemnation of the April 22 terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu & Kashmir, while Afghanistan reaffirmed its support in counterterrorism.""Both sides emphasised respect for each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The external affairs minister appreciated the Afghan side's understanding of India's security concerns. The Afghan foreign minister reiterated the commitment that the Afghan government will not allow any group or individual to use the territory of Afghanistan against India,"" the statement issued by the ministry of external affairs (MEA) read.Muttaqi is on a week-long visit to India (October 9–16), the first such high-level visit since the Taliban takeover in 2021.

RANCHI/GUWAHATI: Central Reserve Police Force ( CRPF ) head constable Mahendra Laskar was killed and two colleagues were wounded after two IEDs planted by Maoists exploded during an anti-insurgency operation in Saranda forest of Jharkhand's West Singhbhum district Friday night.Police said Saturday that Laskar, a 45-year-old native of Nagaon district in Assam, died during treatment at a private hospital in Odisha's Rourkela. Two others - inspector KK Mishra and ASI Ram Krishna Gogi - were wounded but are now stable.The explosions occurred when a joint team of Jharkhand police and CRPF personnel was carrying out a search operation in Saranda. Mishra was wounded in the first blast, while Laskar and Gogi were hit by the second. Security forces later cordoned off the area as operations to trace the Maoists continued through Saturday.West Singhbhum SP Amit Renu said combing operations had been intensified to ""hunt down the culprits responsible for the blasts"".Laskar is survived by his wife, a son, and his mother. One of his brothers is also with CRPF and posted in J&K.Speaking from Kowariati village in Nagaon, Mausumi said her husband had spoken to her shortly before the operation.""He told me it would be a long operation and he might not be able to contact us soon,"" she said. ""His last call was from a hilltop where he got a weak signal. Minutes later, he went out for duty. That was the last time we spoke.""Condolences poured in from across states.

IPS Officer 'Suicide': Wife Seeks FIR Against Haryana DGP, Rohtak SP Over 'Harassment And Abetment'

Poll Do you think mental health support systems are sufficient for officers in high-stress jobs? Yes, they are adequate No, more support is needed

Sonia Gandhi's letter

NEW DELHI: Congress parliamentary party chairperson Sonia Gandhi on Friday wrote to Amneet Kumar, wife of senior Haryana IPS Y Puran Kumar, who died by suicide at his Chandigarh official residence.In his suicide note, Puran Kumar named 16 senior IAS and IPS officers in his note, alleging harassment and holding them directly responsible for his decision to take the extreme step.Sonia Gandhi called the incident ""a grim reminder that even the highest officers in service are not immune to the prejudiced and biased attitude of those in power — an attitude that continues to deny many the ideals of social justice"".""The news of the tragic demise of your husband, senior IPS officer Shri Y. Puran Kumar, is both shocking and deeply saddening. In this hour of immense pain, I extend my heartfelt condolences to you and your entire family,"" the ex-Congress president wrote.""I pray that in this difficult time, the Almighty gives you strength, courage, and comfort,"" the Congress Rajya Sabha MP wrote, adding: ""On this path of justice, I, along with millions across the nation, stand firmly with you.""Puran Kumar, who held the rank of additional director general of police (ADGP), reportedly shot himself at his government accommodation.The Chandigarh Police rushed to the spot after receiving the information and have cordoned off the area.The weapon used in the incident was recovered, and forensic teams arrived on-site for examination.Amid growing pressure following Puran's death by suicide, the Haryana government replaced Rohtak Superintendent of Police Narendra Bijraniya with Surinder Singh Bhoria, officials said on Saturday.On Wednesday, sources told TOI that the state government is also considering sending Director General of Police (DGP) Shatrujeet Singh Kapur on long leave, and may even appoint an “officiating DGP” to defuse the mounting tension within the police ranks.Chandigarh Police, two days after Kumar’s death (on Thursday), registered an FIR (No. 156) at Sector 11 police station, based on his eight-page suicide note.The government’s move to reshuffle key police posts follows growing outrage within the civil and police services, as well as demands from the public for accountability and transparency in the probe.Puran Kumar's note named eight senior IPS officers, including DGP Kapur and SP Bijraniya, alleging harassment and attempts to malign him.The case has been registered under charges of abetment to suicide and relevant provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.Kumar’s wife, 2001-batch IAS officer Amneet P Kumar, has demanded the suspension and arrest of all officials mentioned in the note.She personally handed over her complaint to chief minister Nayab Singh Saini when he visited their Sector 24 residence in Chandigarh around 12.30 pm on Thursday.The chief minister stayed for nearly 45 minutes, offering condolences and joining the family in prayer.In her letter, Amneet alleged that the officers named in her husband’s suicide note were responsible for “harassment, humiliation, and mental torture” leading to his death.She said the note should be treated as a dying declaration and urged authorities to act swiftly to prevent interference or tampering with evidence.She also sought permanent security for her family, particularly their two daughters, citing “serious threat and mental distress.”The officer’s family reportedly refused to perform his last rites until “justice is served.”","Congress parliamentary party chairperson Sonia Gandhi wrote to Amneet Kumar, wife of senior Haryana IPS Y Puran Kumar, who died by suicide at his Chandigarh official residence.

Rapid health decline and fatal complications following cosmetic procedure



Legal battle and allegations raise concerns over cosmetic procedure oversight







Brazilian social media influencer Adair Mendes Dutra Junior, widely known as Junior Dutra, has died at the age of 31 following severe, unexpected complications from a cosmetic procedure. Known for his vibrant social media presence, creative lifestyle content, and engaging personality, Junior had gained a large, loyal following on Instagram. His untimely death has sent shockwaves through the Brazilian beauty community, social media circles, and among his over 100,000 devoted followers, many of whom expressed grief, disbelief, and heartbreak across multiple platforms.The tragedy unfolded after he underwent a popular cosmetic procedure called the “fox eyes” surgery, which aims to lift, reshape, and elongate the outer corners of the eyes for a more striking, model-like appearance. What was intended as a simple beauty enhancement turned fatal, tragically highlighting the potential risks, hidden dangers, and lack of regulation surrounding trendy cosmetic procedures increasingly sought after by influencers worldwide.Junior Dutra reportedly underwent the fox eyes procedure in March, performed by celebrity dentist Fernando Simionato Garbi. The influencer had publicly shared videos documenting the procedure, later revealing significant swelling, bruising, and redness around his eyes.Following the treatment, Junior developed a serious infection, which persisted despite dermatological care. In an interview with Brazilian outlet Feed TV, just a month before his death, he shared his deteriorating health: “I didn’t expect it to get this bad.” He described frequent hospital visits as he struggled to recover from post-procedure complications.This situation underscores a critical point: even procedures that appear minimally invasive or cosmetic can carry severe health risks if complications arise.The fox eyes or cat eyes surgery has surged in popularity in recent years, inspired by celebrities like Bella Hadid and Kendall Jenner. The procedure is designed to create an almond-shaped, lifted eye by raising the outer corners, giving a youthful and striking appearance.According to the American Board of Cosmetic Surgery (ABCS), several methods can achieve this look, including:Despite their popularity, these treatments are not risk-free. The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) warns that complications can include:The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also cautioned against the use of PDO threads for eyebrow or eyelid lifts, noting potential for permanent disfigurement, severe swelling, and long-lasting pain.Medical experts emphasise the importance of monitoring for early warning signs of complications. Post-procedure symptoms that should not be ignored include:To minimise risks, specialists recommend:Junior Dutra’s health reportedly worsened rapidly in his final days. His close friend Gean Souza told Brazilian magazine Quem that he began experiencing shortness of breath and extreme weakness. As reported by The US Sun, on October 3, Junior was rushed to a public hospital in São Paulo after severe respiratory distress. Despite emergency care, he could not be saved. His sudden passing left fans and the online beauty community in shock, illustrating how quickly post-procedure complications can escalate.Adding further complexity to the tragedy, Junior had filed a police complaint prior to his death. Legal documents obtained by Brazilian outlet Portland Leo Dias reveal that Junior accused Garbi of performing medical procedures outside his professional license and impersonating a doctor. The complaint included charges of illegal medical practice, fraud, and causing serious bodily harm. Junior had also requested an official investigation by the 15th Police District of São Paulo.Garbi, through legal representatives, denied any wrongdoing and maintained that his procedures were performed legally and safely under proper supervision. The case highlights the need for stronger regulatory oversight in cosmetic procedures, particularly those fueled by social media trends.","Brazilian social media influencer Adair Mendes Dutra Junior, widely known as Junior Dutra, has died at the age of 31 following severe, unexpected complications from a cosmetic procedure.

Returning to rubble, searching for hope



'The war is over'







Thousands of displaced Palestinians poured back into the shattered north of Gaza on Friday, trekking through wastelands and rubble to the ruins of homes they had not seen in two years, as a ceasefire took effect and Israeli troops began withdrawing under the first phase of a US-brokered peace deal.Long columns of families, many barefoot or pushing bicycles laden with salvaged belongings, walked along Gaza’s coastal highway toward Gaza City, the enclave’s largest urban center and the site of one of Israel’s fiercest offensives. To the south, residents picked their way through the pulverized remains of Khan Younis, once Gaza’s second-largest city, now reduced to dust and twisted metal.For many, the return was bittersweet. ""We went back to our area — it was exterminated,"" Ahmed al-Brim, a middle-aged man pushing a bicycle stacked with scraps of timber he hoped to use for firewood,"" Reuters reported.""We couldn’t find furniture or clothes. Not even winter clothes. Nothing is left,"" Ahmed added.Gaza’s health authorities said recovery teams had pulled more than 100 bodies from the rubble since the Israeli army began pulling back.The ceasefire, which came into effect at noon local time (0900 GMT), marks the first tangible step in a sweeping 20-point peace plan announced by US President Donald Trump earlier this week to end two years of relentless war between Israel and Hamas.Under the agreement’s first phase, Israeli troops are required to withdraw from urban areas within 24 hours while retaining control over more than half of Gaza for now.In return, Hamas has 72 hours to release 20 surviving Israeli hostages — part of a broader exchange that will see Israel free 250 long-term Palestinian prisoners and 1,700 detainees held since the war began.Trump told reporters at the White House that he was ""confident the ceasefire will hold,"" describing it as a ""turning point"" that reflected exhaustion on both sides.""They’re all tired of fighting,” he said. ""We now have a consensus on the next steps.""The US president is scheduled to travel to the Middle East next week to address Israel’s parliament — the Knesset, in Jerusalem, becoming the first American leader to do so since George W. Bush in 2008.He is also expected to visit Egypt, where sources say an international summit on Gaza’s reconstruction will be convened, with several world leaders in attendance.Trump’s plan envisions the creation of an international “Board of Peace,” chaired by him and including former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, to oversee Gaza’s post-war administration and reconstruction.However, Hamas has already rejected the idea, denouncing any form of “foreign guardianship” and insisting that Gaza’s governance “remains a purely Palestinian matter.”Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed the ceasefire but made clear that the Israeli military would maintain a presence in Gaza until Hamas is fully disarmed.“If Hamas disarms, peace will come the easy way. If not, it will come the hard way,” Netanyahu said in a televised statement, warning that Israel’s withdrawal did not mark an end to security operations.Israeli police said they were preparing for Trump’s visit on Monday, calling it a “historic moment” in US -Israel relations.Meanwhile, Brigadier General Effie Defrin, a military spokesperson, urged Gazans to “respect the agreement” and avoid entering areas still under Israeli control.For many Gazans, Friday was a day of relief mixed with despair. After two years of displacement, families streamed back to neighborhoods flattened by bombing campaigns. Children played among broken walls while adults sifted through debris, hoping to recover fragments of their former lives.Mahdi Saqla, 40, was among those walking north. “Our homes are gone,” he said quietly. “But we are happy to stand again where our homes once stood — even if it’s just over rubble. That, too, is a kind of joy.”The Israeli government ratified the ceasefire in the early hours of Friday. As part of the humanitarian provisions, hundreds of trucks carrying food, fuel, and medical aid are expected to enter Gaza daily over the coming week.Trump said the 20 Israeli hostages still alive are expected to “come back home” on Monday.Khalil Al-Hayya, the exiled Gaza chief of Hamas, told reporters the group had received ""clear guarantees"" from the United States and mediators that the war was over.The war, triggered by Hamas’s deadly October 7, 2023, attack on Israeli communities and a music festival that killed 1,200 people and resulted in 251 hostages being taken, has since claimed more than 67,000 Palestinian lives, according to Gaza’s health ministry.Twenty of the original hostages are believed to be alive, 26 presumed dead, and the fate of two remains unknown. Hamas officials have said recovering the bodies of the dead may take longer than releasing living captives.Despite the breakthrough, key elements of Trump's peace blueprint remain uncertain. The most contentious questions, who will govern Gaza after the war, whether Hamas will agree to disarm, and how reconstruction will proceed are still unresolved.The Hamas-run interior ministry said it would redeploy local security forces to maintain order in areas vacated by Israeli troops, though it remains unclear whether armed militants will return to the streets. Any visible reappearance of Hamas fighters could quickly reignite hostilities.For now, Gaza’s weary residents are taking tentative steps toward normalcy, uncertain how long the calm will last.","Ceasefire took effect at noon local time (0900 GMT) Israeli troops are required to withdraw from urban areas within 24 hours.

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Friday listed Pakistan sponsored cross-border terrorism as a ""shared threat"" for both India and Afghanistan as he met his Afghanistani counterpart Amir Khan Muttaqi in Delhi.In his opening remarks, Jaishankar termed cross-border terrorism as a ""menace"" and said that India and Afghanistan must coordinate efforts to combat. He also called Afghanistan as a ""contiguous"" neighbour to send a strong message to Pakistan over its illegal occupation in Jammu and Kashmir.""As a contiguous neighbour and a well-wisher of the Afghan people, India has a deep interest in your development and progress,"" Jaishankar said.""However, these are endangered by the shared threat of cross-border terrorism that both our nations face.

French PM BREAKS Record, Resigns Hours After Forming Govt; Macron OFFICIALLY ‘Sick Man Of Europe’?

Far right vows to immediately oust new Lecornu government





French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday reappointed Sébastien Lecornu as the country’s prime minister, the Élysée Palace announced, bringing an end to a week of political turmoil.""The president of the republic has nominated Mr Sebastien Lecornu as prime minister and has tasked him with forming a government,"" the Élysée Palace said in a statement.Lecornu, in a message on X, said he accepted his reappointment ""out of duty"", adding that ""we must end the political crisis"" gripping France.He said he would do ""everything possible"" to give France a budget by the end of the year and added that restoring the public finances remained ""a priority for our future"".France's main far-right party on Friday vowed to immediately seek to bring down the new French government led by Sébastien Lecornu after his reappointment as premier, saying it did not have ""any future"".Labelling the move by an ""isolated and disconnected"" President Emmanuel Macron to reappoint Lecornu a ""bad joke"", National Rally (RN) leader Jordan Bardella said his party will ""immediately of course censure this coalition which does not have any future"" through a no-confidence motion in parliament.Lecornu had abruptly resigned on Monday, just hours after unveiling a new Cabinet that drew opposition from a key coalition partner.His sudden departure prompted called for Macron to step down or dissolve parliament, but the president instead announced on Wednesday that he would name a successor within 48 hours.With no majority in the National Assembly to push through his reform agenda, Macron has faced growing criticism from both the opposition and members of his own camp. Political observers say the reappointment underlines the president’s limited room for manoeuvre.Political party leaders who met Macron for more than two hours on Friday said they were unsure what decision he would take. Some cautioned that reappointing a prime minister from his fragile centrist bloc could again be rejected by the lower house, prolonging the crisis.","Far right vows to immediately oust new Lecornu government.

Afghanistan-Pakistan conflict: Will Saudi Arabia step in? Here's what Kingdom said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/afghanistan-pakistan-conflict-will-saudi-arabia-step-in-heres-what-kingdom-said/articleshow/124493897.cms,"Pakistan Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed-bin-Salman after signing the defence pact.





Heavy fighting along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border has reignited fears of broader regional instability. Pakistani forces and the Taliban have been engaged in repeated clashes, with Islamabad accused of air strikes and retaliatory operations. The Taliban regime has condemned these actions, warning of escalating conflict that could spill over beyond the border.Amid this growing tension, attention has turned to Saudi Arabia ’s newly signed defence pact with Pakistan , formalised in September 2025. Under the agreement, both nations commit to collective security, an attack on one is considered an attack on both. Saudi Arabia has explicitly pledged to defend Pakistan against external aggression, a move analysts say could have profound implications for regional geopolitics.So far, Riyadh has publicly called for restraint, urging both sides to avoid escalation and prioritise dialogue. However, the pact positions Saudi Arabia as a strategic backstop for Pakistan. While the kingdom has not openly declared it would intervene militarily against Afghanistan, the formalisation of the agreement signals a willingness to support Islamabad if the conflict intensifies.“The kingdom calls for restraint, avoiding escalation, and embracing dialogue and wisdom to contribute to reducing tensions and maintaining security and stability in the region,” the Saudi Foreign Ministry said.“The kingdom affirms its support for all regional and international efforts aimed at promoting peace and stability, and its continued commitment to ensuring security, which will achieve stability and prosperity for the brotherly Pakistani and Afghan peoples,” it added.Yet, there might be a potential strategic calculation behind Riyadh’s measured public stance. While Saudi officials have stopped short of committing to direct military involvement in Afghanistan, the defence pact clearly positions the kingdom as Pakistan’s security backstop.In case the border clashes intensify, Saudi Arabia could be drawn into supporting Islamabad, maybe not out of immediate desire for confrontation, but as a strategic move to protect alliances and regional stability.The pact also reflects broader shifts in Middle Eastern foreign policy. Saudi Arabia appears to be embracing extended deterrence, signalling to regional actors that it will actively defend its partners against external threats, particularly in volatile zones like South and Central Asia. While diplomacy remains the preferred route, the kingdom’s commitment to Pakistan cannot be dismissed lightly.Meanwhile, Trump's desire to regain control of Afghanistan’s Bagram Air Base adds a significant geopolitical layer to the Saudi-Pakistan defence pact and the ongoing Pak-Afghan conflict. Trump has expressed a clear and forceful interest in reclaiming this strategic military base, citing its vital importance for projecting power in the region, particularly as a counterbalance to China, which he considers a primary strategic rival.Bagram Air Base, abandoned by US forces during their 2021 withdrawal, remains a rare foothold in Afghanistan capable of supporting large military operations due to the country’s challenging mountainous terrain.It cannot be ruled out that the United States could leverage its strategic ties with Saudi Arabia and Pakistan to build pressure on Afghanistan regarding the Bagram Air Base. Pakistan, given its complex relationship with Afghanistan and its defence pact with Saudi Arabia, could serve as a tool to put pressure on the Taliban-led Afghan government.However, such pressure would be delicate, considering Saudi Arabia’s public calls for restraint amid the newly escalated Pak-Afghan border clashes and its preference for diplomatic solutions so far. Additionally, regional players like China, Russia, and Iran are strongly opposed to renewed foreign military presence in Afghanistan, complicating any overt coercive move.While Riyadh has publicly called for restraint and dialogue, the combination of the defence pact, the intensifying Pakistan-Afghanistan clashes, and the strategic interests of Saudi Arabia suggests that military support for Islamabad remains a plausible scenario if regional tensions escalate further. For now, analysts caution that the pact is both a diplomatic warning and a potential military guarantee, leaving the region on edge.","Pakistani forces and the Taliban have been engaged in repeated clashes, with Islamabad accused of air strikes and retaliatory operations.

What Pakistan claimed



What Taliban said





Bone of contention: TTP







Along the jagged spine of the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, where generations have grown up knowing the sound of gunfire and the shadow of conflict, tensions flared again as intense clashes broke out on Saturday night. Taliban forces struck at Pakistani posts, and in return, Pakistan’s military fired back, turning a stretch of mountains and valleys into another arena of conflict.Earlier in the week, Afghan authorities accused Pakistan of bombing the capital, Kabul, and a market in the country’s east. Pakistan did not claim responsibility for the assault.Here are 10 things to know:1. The violence began when Taliban forces allegedly opened fire on several Pakistani border posts late Saturday.2. The firing took place at several key posts, including Angoor Adda, Bajaur, Kurram, Dir, Chitral in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Baramcha in Balochistan, The Express Tribune reported, as cited by the news agency ANI.3. Pakistan Security sources said that the firing was aimed at facilitating the illegal entry of Khwarij -- the state-designated term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) -- into Pakistani territory, as reported by The Express Tribune.4, ""The counteroffensive effectively targeted and destroyed multiple Afghan posts at border. Dozens of Afghan soldiers and Khwarij were killed in retaliatory fire,"" news agency ANI reported, citing Express Tribune.5. Pakistani Minister of Interior Mohsin Naqvi called the Afghan attacks ""unprovoked"" and said that Pakistani forces were responding ""with a stone for every brick"". ""Firing by Afghan forces on civilian population is a blatant violation of international laws. Pakistan’s brave forces have given a prompt and effective response that no provocation will be tolerated,"" he said in a post on X.6. Afghanistan’s Taliban forces said they launched armed reprisals against Pakistani soldiers along the border, accusing Islamabad of air strikes on their soil.7. ""In retaliation for air strikes carried out by the Pakistani army on Kabul,"" Taliban forces are engaged ""in heavy clashes against Pakistani security forces in various areas"" along the border, the Afghan military said in a statement, as citeb by AFP.8. Later, Taliban defence ministry spokesman Enayat Khowarazm told news agency AFP the ""successful"" operations had ended at midnight. But he warned: ""If the opposing side violates Afghanistan's territory again, our armed forces are ready to defend their territory and will respond firmly.""9. Pakistan did not acknowledge carrying out Thursday's attacks but urged Kabul ""to stop harbouring the Pakistani Taliban (TTP) on its soil.""10. The TTP, which has received combat training in Afghanistan and shares the Afghan Taliban’s ideology, is accused by Pakistan of killing hundreds of its soldiers since 2021.The heightened tensions from Pakistan come as Afghanistan’s foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, is on a week-long visit to India, marking the first high-level trip from Kabul since the Taliban took power in August 2021.",Taliban forces allegedly opened fire on several Pakistani border posts late Saturday.

Hamas has asked Israel to add prominent Palestinians to a prisoner-release list as part of a ceasefire agreement that will also include the return of hostages from Gaza.The call follows the Israeli justice ministry’s announcement of 250 prisoners slated for release, which notably excluded seven high-profile figures, including Marwan Barghouti and Ahmad Saadat.Convicted for their roles in separate deadly attacks in Israel, the men are regarded by many Palestinians as enduring symbols of resistance.Of the 250 prisoners set for release, 15 will go to East Jerusalem, 100 to the West Bank, and 135, convicted of murder or weapons offenses, are slated for deportation to Gaza or other locations, according to the government’s Friday announcement, as reported by the Times of Israel.- He is the commander of Palestinian Islamic Jihad in the Jenin area of the West Bank and has orchestrated several deadly attacks, including suicide bombings in Shadmot Mechola (June 2003), Tel Aviv (February 2004), and Hadera (2005), which together claimed 13 lives.- a senior Hamas member released in the Shalit deal, deported to Gaza, and re-arrested during the 2024 Gaza war, is also slated for release.- A 52-year-old local Hamas leader, convicted for directing a 2004 double suicide bombing that killed 16 Israelis, was captured by Israeli forces in the West Bank two months after the attack while in his underwear. According to the Prisoners Organization Media Office, he is considered one of the “leaders” among incarcerated terrorists and is serving 16 life sentences, as cited by the New York Post.- A 25-year-old Palestinian was convicted of fatally stabbing Dafna Meir, a 39-year-old mother of six, in 2016 using a kitchen knife. He was 16 at the time and reportedly went home to watch a movie with his family after the attack.- He was sentenced for orchestrating the 2004 Jerusalem street bus suicide bombing, which killed 11 Israelis and the bomber, and injured 50 others.- A Hamas member arrested in 2004 alongside his brother for plotting a bus station suicide bombing near an IDF base that killed eight people.Barghouti, 66, is serving multiple life sentences for the 2004 attacks that killed five Israelis. Despite remaining in prison, he is considered a potential successor to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, enjoying broad support among Palestinians while backing a two-state solution.","Hamas has asked Israel to add prominent Palestinians to a prisoner-release list as part of a ceasefire agreement.

Meet Maria Corina Machado — 2025 Nobel Peace Prize Winner Who Crushed Trump's Hopes

Machado's 2021 post

Machado's 2018 post

What is her background?



When did she go into hiding?





Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday, drew criticism over her past posts on X, supporting Israel's military action in Gaza and urging Argentina and Israel to ""dismantle"" the criminal Venezuelan regime.In one of her posts in 2021, Machado had said that those who defend Western values stand with Israel, which she called a ""genuine ally of freedom"".Three years back, in 2018, she requested the Israeli PM and the Argentinian president to use ""their influence"" to ""advance the dismantling of the criminal Venezuelan regime"".""Today, all those who defend Western values stand with the State of Israel; a genuine ally of freedom,"" Machado posted on X in 2021 (then Twitter ).According to several media reports, Machado had said that, if elected, she would move Venezuela’s embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.“I believe and I can announce that our government will move our Israeli embassy to Jerusalem,” Machado told an Israeli channel.“I promise one day, we’ll have a close relationship between Venezuela and Israel. That will be part of our support to the State of Israel,” she added.In 2009, under Hugo Chavez, Venezuela severed diplomatic ties with Israel and expelled its ambassador in response to the 2008–2009 Gaza War.""Today I am sending a letter to @mauriciomacri, President of Argentina, and to @netanyahu, Prime Minister of Israel, to ask them to use their strength and influence to advance the dismantling of the criminal Venezuelan regime, closely linked to drug trafficking and terrorism,"" she posted in 2018.Machado won the Nobel Peace Prize for promoting democratic rights and her struggle to achieve a transition to democracy, the Norwegian Nobel Committee said.Machado had prompted millions of Venezuelans to reject President Nicolás Maduro in last year's election. The award also recognised the seasoned politician for being a “unifying figure” in the fractured opposition.The award, however, is being granted at a time when opposition supporters are questioning her leadership, including her embrace of US president Donald Trump's Venezuela policy, which has seen Venezuelan migrants sent to an infamous prison in Central America and deadly US military strikes in the Caribbean.The Norwegian Nobel Institute was able to reach Machado by telephone a few moments before the prize was announced to tell her she had been selected. ""Oh, my God,"" she said in a video posted by the committee on social media. ""Well, I have no words.""In her campaigns opposing the Venezuelan government, she has spent more than two decades building relationships in Washington, with Democrats and Republicans alike. In 2005, she was received in the White House by President George W. Bush, and she has been praised extensively by Marco Rubio, the secretary of state and former Florida senator.She argues, like Trump, that Maduro poses an enormous security threat to the region.Maria Corina Machado, 58, was born in Caracas, Venezuela, on October 7, 1967. She is an industrial engineer by training, and her father was a prominent businessman in Venezuela's steel industry. Her upper-class roots have made her a target of criticism from Venezuela's governing socialist party.Machado won a resounding victory in the opposition's primary election in 2023 and her rallies attracted large crowds, but a ban from holding public office prevented her from running for president against Nicolas Maduro in an election in 2024 and she went into hiding.The country's electoral authority and top court say Maduro won the election, though they have never published detailed tallies. Machado emerged from hiding to make a brief appearance during a protest before Maduro's inauguration in Jan. She was briefly arrested and then freed.","Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday.

Hours after Israel withdrew its troops from Gaza City in the opening stage of a US-brokered ceasefire , tens of thousands of Palestinians trudged back to sift through bombed out buildings overseen by Hamas security operatives.The Hamas interior ministry said in a statement on Friday that its police force would deploy across the territory. By Saturday, masked men wearing caps labelled ""Internal Security"" and armed with Kalashnikov assault rifles were inspecting car trunks and reasserting their authority, according to witnesses and images posted on social media and filmed by Al Jazeera.It was an early sign that Israel's goal of removing the Islamist group from power - and US President Donald Trump's aim of a lasting peace - won't be simple. Nor will the task of rebuilding.""Everybody I know has lost their house,"" said Mahmoud Faraj, who left Gaza City with his family last month when Israeli troops took over.

'NONSENSE': Hamas' Big Attack On Trump's 'PRO-ISRAEL' Plan Hours Before Gaza Hostage Release





A viral video shows NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani being chased from Foley Square by protesters accusing him of antisemitism and demanding he denounce Hezbollah and Sharia law.In the video, Mamdani is seen being escorted by his security through the square toward a waiting vehicle, while a man trails behind shouting, “denounce Hezbollah! denounce Sharia law!”The footage, shared on X, captures protesters surrounding Mamdani as they shout and drum during the tense exchange.Mamdani had been speaking at Foley Square in a show of support for New York Attorney General Letitia James, who was indicted earlier this week on mortgage fraud charges linked to a property she owns in Virginia.The protester appeared to confront Mamdani over his recent remarks marking the second anniversary of Hamas’s October 7 attack, in which he accused the Israeli government of waging a “genocidal war” in Gaza and said the US “has been complicit through it all.”""Two years ago today, Hamas carried out a horrific war crime, killing more than 1,100 Israelis and kidnapping 250 more. I mourn these lives and pray for the safe return of every hostage still held and for every family whose lives were torn apart by these atrocities,"" Mamdani said.Mamdani condemned Israel’s actions in Gaza, citing a death toll exceeding 67,000 and the destruction of homes, hospitals, and schools.""Every day in Gaza has become a place where grief itself has run out of language.I mourn these lives and pray for the families that have been shattered,"" the statement by Mamdani read.Mamdani’s remarks prompted the Israeli foreign ministry to repost his statement on X, accusing him of “acting as a mouthpiece for Hamas propaganda.”""By repeating Hamas’s lies, he excuses terror and normalizes antisemitism.

From ‘Racist’ To Dealmaker: Trump Wins Hamas Trust In High-Stakes Gaza Ceasefire | Watch





Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised his US counterpart Donald Trump for his “outstanding achievement” in securing a Gaza ceasefire during a “very positive and productive” phone call.""I had a call with US President Donald Trump—a very positive and productive one. I congratulated @POTUS on his success and the Middle East deal he was able to secure, which is an outstanding achievement. If a war can be stopped in one region, then surely other wars can be stopped as well—including the Russian war,"" Zelenskyy said through a post on X.The two leaders also discussed Russian strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure and measures to strengthen the country’s air defences, Zelenskyy said, “as well as concrete agreements that we are working on to ensure this.”The leaders also discussed the possible supply of Tomahawk long-range missiles, according to two sources familiar with the matter, as reported by Axios.Tomahawk missiles would enable Ukraine to target deep into Russian territory, including Moscow, with Kyiv arguing they could pressure Putin to come to the negotiating table.The call took place a day after Russia carried out a major strike on Ukraine’s energy grid, cutting power in parts of Kyiv and nine other regions, as cited by AFP.Trump, who unveiled the first phase of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas on Wednesday, previously met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in August but was unable to secure a peace agreement.Relations between the two leaders have improved significantly since their tense televised encounter at the White House in February.Since then, Trump has adopted a tougher stance toward Moscow while showing support for Ukraine. In September, he wrote on Truth Social that Kyiv should seek to “take back” all occupied territory with the backing of Europe and Nato.On Friday, US First Lady Melania Trump announced she had facilitated the release of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia, using an extraordinary back channel to communicate directly with Putin.",Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised his US counterpart Donald Trump for his “outstanding achievement” in securing a Gaza ceasefire.

‘Do you want her to live?’ Teen’s chilling words to sister



‘Cleaning,’ said the accused as mother entered blood-soaked home



Mother blames medical system for failure



‘We ask the public to withhold judgment’







A Staten Island mother has described in harrowing detail how her mentally ill son allegedly killed and decapitated her boyfriend in their home earlier this week - an act she believes could have been prevented if his medical treatment had been properly managed.According to The New York Post, 19-year-old Damien Hurstel confessed to stabbing and beheading his mother’s live-in boyfriend, Anthony Casalaspro, 45, inside their family apartment on Cary Avenue in West Brighton on Monday. Police have charged him with second-degree murder, manslaughter, and criminal possession of a weapon.Authorities said the crime scene showed Casalaspro’s severed head beside his torso in a walk-in shower, with a saw, a bowl, and a spoon nearby. The Post reported that the handle of a silver-colored spoon was sticking out of the dismembered skull.In an interview with The Post, Hurstel’s mother Alicia Zayas recounted how her 16-year-old daughter, Bri, came face to face with her blood-soaked brother just moments after the killing.“She said, ‘Are you gonna hurt mom?’” Zayas recalled her daughter asking. “And he said, ‘Do you want her to live?’ And she said, ‘Yes, please.’He said, ‘Okay, she’ll live.’”Bri then asked if she could leave the blood-splattered bathroom where, according to police sources cited by The Post, the victim’s brain had been partially removed with a spoon. “Are you gonna tell mom?” Damien asked his sister. “No,” she replied.Bri fled the apartment, hid behind a backyard shed, and immediately called her mother. “She called me scared,” Zayas said. “I could hear it in her voice. I said, ‘Are you somewhere safe?’ She said, ‘Damien killed Anthony, and he doesn’t have a head.’”Zayas told The Post she rushed home to find the front door open. Before going inside, she warned her daughter, “If you don’t hear from me in two minutes, you need to call 911. Tell them to come quickly.”Inside, she saw blood everywhere. Her son was in the kitchen. “His eyes looked different,” she recalled. “He has light eyes. The eyes looked dark. It looked weird. I said, ‘Damien, what’s going on? What’s wrong, honey? What are you doing?’”“Cleaning,” Damien responded flatly, “as if he’s cleaning dishes, like it’s normal,” she said.When Zayas asked where Casalaspro was, her son told her, “He’s in the bathroom. But you don’t want to go in there.”“I said, ‘Well, Damien, I have to go in there. I have to see Anthony,’” she remembered. She walked slowly toward the bathroom, too frightened to turn her back to him.“There’s blood everywhere,” she said. “I saw the scene and started screaming, ‘Why? Why? Why? Why? He loves you. Why would you do this?’”Zayas called 911. “Come quick,” she told the dispatcher. “My son killed my boyfriend. They said, ‘Can he be saved? … How do you know he’s dead?’ I said, ‘He has no head.’”She then ran outside to wait for police and pleaded with responding officers not to harm her son.Zayas told The Post that her son’s actions stemmed from untreated and mishandled mental illness. She said doctors had changed his medication in January without informing her, discontinuing Depakote, an antipsychotic he had been taking for years.She discovered the change only when a CVS pharmacist told her Damien needed to be weaned off the old drug slowly. “Why wouldn’t they tell us?” Zayas said. “They’re doctors. I’m sure they knew.”Once Damien turned 18, his psychiatrist refused to share treatment details with her due to privacy laws. “I didn’t even know what doctors he was going to,” Zayas said. “I don’t even know if he was going to all the appointments. Every morning I remind him to take his medications. He said he was taking it.”Zayas said her son began showing mental health issues at age six, after his father went to prison. At 13, after being sexually abused by another student, he started hallucinating and was diagnosed with PTSD and major depression. “He saw shadow figures, very disturbing images, almost like horror movies,” she said. “He would draw them for me.”He was first prescribed antipsychotics at that time and was hospitalized twice after suicide attempts. By 14, she said, he was stable and on medication. “I’m just devastated,” she said. “My son wasn’t like this before. He was a good boy. Something is seriously wrong with him.”She added that Damien could sometimes be violent - once assaulting her on her birthday when she asked him to clean the kitchen - but insisted her boyfriend, Casalaspro, “was not abusive.”Zayas’ attorneys, Mark Fonte and Louis Gelormino, said their firm is working to obtain Damien’s psychiatric records to understand what led to the killing. “We ask the public to withhold judgment,” said Gelormino. “Damien Hurstel is an extremely troubled young man with a long documented history of mental health issues.”Zayas said she and Casalaspro, a city sanitation worker, had been planning to buy a home together. “I’m heartbroken,” she said. “Anthony was a great man. He was helping me raise my kids. He didn’t have to do that.”","Damien Hurstel, 19, confessed to stabbing and beheading his mother's live-in boyfriend, Anthony Casalaspro, 45, inside their family apartment on Cary Avenue in West Brighton on Monday.

Poll Is the current tsunami warning system adequate for coastal areas? Yes, it is No, needs improvement

10 days after 6.9 earthquake that left 74 dead





A powerful earthquake measuring 7.6 magnitude struck the Mindanao region of the Philippines on Friday, triggering tsunami warnings for nearby coastal areas, according to the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC).The earthquake occurred at a depth of 58 kilometers beneath the surface and has left two people dead.EMSC had initially reported the earthquake's magnitude as 7.2 before revising it upward to 7.6.The US Tsunami Warning System had issued an alert, warning that dangerous tsunami waves could potentially affect coastal areas within 300 kilometers of the earthquake's epicenter.Indonesia also issued a tsunami warning for northern Sulawesi and Papua regions after a strong earthquake hit the southern Philippines, Indonesia's geophysics agency said.The agency's modelling suggested there was a risk of tsunami waves as high as 50 cm hitting Indonesia's shorelines, it said in a statement.The warning has now been lifted.The Philippines is still grappling with the aftermath of a 6.9 magnitude earthquake that struck on September 30, claiming 74 lives and forcing thousands to evacuate in Cebu province, particularly affecting Bogo city and surrounding areas.The Philippines' location on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire,"" an arc of seismic faults around the ocean, makes it particularly vulnerable to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.The country faces approximately 20 typhoons and storms annually, requiring extensive disaster response efforts from both government agencies and volunteer organizations.These natural disasters have established the Philippines as one of the world's most disaster-prone nations, demanding constant preparedness and response mechanisms.","The earthquake occurred at a depth of 58 kilometers beneath the surface and has left two people dead.

Putin & Melania Trump: COLLAB No One Saw Coming! US’ 1st Lady & Russian Leader Team Up For Ukraine

Elusive figure





WASHINGTON: US First Lady Melania Trump said Friday she had secured the release of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia after establishing an extraordinary back channel of communication with President Vladimir Putin In a rare public announcement at the White House, she revealed weeks of behind the scenes diplomacy with the Kremlin chief after he held a summit in Alaska with her husband, US President Donald Trump.Eight children displaced by Moscow's 2022 invasion of Ukraine had been returned to their homes in the last 24 hours, she said.The 55-year-old said that Putin had agreed to help after she passed him a letter through Trump at the summit, a meeting which otherwise ended without a breakthrough in resolving the war now in its fourth year.""Much has unfolded since President Putin received my letter last August. He responded in writing signalling a willingness to engage with me directly and outlining details regarding the Ukrainian children residing in Russia,"" she told reporters.""Since then, President Putin and I have had an open channel of communication regarding the welfare of these children.""The Slovenian-born former model said that both sides had also had ""several back channel meetings and calls, all in good faith.""""My representative has been working directly with President Putin's team to ensure the safe reunification of children with their families between Russia and Ukraine,"" she said.""In fact, eight children have been rejoined with their families during the past 24 hours.""Seven of them were returned to Ukraine from Russia, she said, while one young girl went back to Russia from Ukraine.Three were separated from their parents and ""displaced to the Russian Federation by frontline fighting,"" she said.The others including the girl returned to Russia were ""separated from family members across borders"" by the conflict.Kyiv has accused Moscow of abducting almost 20,000 children from parts of the east and south of Ukraine after Moscow's troops invaded in February 2022.Ukraine has made the issue of the abducted children a diplomatic priority.The International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Putin and his children's rights commissioner, Maria Lvova-Belova, over the allegations of child abductions.Russia has said it moved some Ukrainian children from their houses or orphanages for protection due to the threat of hostilities.Melania Trump said in her announcement that Russia had ""demonstrated a willingness"" to share details to identify abducted children, including biographies and photos.She said she would continue to work for more children to return to their homes.""This is an important initiative for me. It is built on shared purpose and lasting impact,"" she added.The announcement marked a rare glimmer of progress in the Ukraine war, which Trump vowed to solve within 24 hours of taking office but now admits is the most difficult conflict he has tried to solve.It was also a rare solo appearance by Melania Trump, who has been an elusive figure at the White House since her husband's return to power in January, preferring to spend her time in New York or Florida.But she has highlighted a number of initiatives, often involving children.Melania also accompanied her husband on his state visit to Britain in September, making a joint appearance with Princess Catherine, wife of heir to the throne Prince William.",Melania Trump says she has secured the release of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia.

Mike Jhonson 'Exposes' Democrats On Day 10 Of US Govt Shutdown | Watch





President Donald Trump has directed the Pentagon to use all available funds to ensure that US troops receive their paychecks on October 15, despite the ongoing government shutdown, triggered by a standoff between Republicans and Democrats. In a statement posted on Truth Social, Trump criticised Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and the Democrats for the impasse, accusing them of holding the military and national security “hostage.”Trump said, “Every day gets better” - a remark by Schumer - is “wrong,” warning that without action from the Democrats, troops could miss their pay, “I DISAGREE! If nothing is done, because of ‘Leader’ Chuck Schumer and the Democrats, our Brave Troops will miss the paychecks they are rightfully due on October 15th,” Trump wrote.He added, “That is why I am using my authority, as Commander in Chief, to direct our Secretary of War, Pete Hegseth, to use all available funds to get our Troops PAID on October 15th. We have identified funds to do this, and Secretary Hegseth will use them to PAY OUR TROOPS.”Trump reiterated his stance against the government shutdown and urged the Democrats to reopen the government before working on issues such as healthcare, which he said they want to “destroy”.“The Radical Left Democrats should OPEN THE GOVERNMENT, and then we can work together to address Healthcare, and many other things that they want to destroy,” he said.Schumer’s comment- “each day our case to fix healthcare and end the shutdown gets better and better and stronger and stronger”- was made on Thurdsay on the Senate floor, where he attempted to strike a confident tone regarding Democrats' position in the ongoing negotiations over federal funding.However, the remark triggered sharp reactions across the Republican spectrum. Senate majority leader John Thune said, “Democrats couldn’t care less whether military families miss a paycheck tomorrow”. He further criticised Democrats saying “it isn’t a political game”.The government shutdown, triggered by the failure of Congress to agree on funding, has raised concerns about its impact on federal employees and military personnel, with October 15 marking the next scheduled payday for troops.This move by Trump highlights ongoing political tensions in Washington as the shutdown continues. The Pentagon has yet to publicly confirm details regarding the funding directive.","President Donald Trump has directed the Pentagon to use all available funds to ensure that US troops receive their paychecks on October 15.

Tennessee Bomb Factory Blast: All 19 Workers Presumed Dead In Shocking Explosion





Investigators now say a massive explosion at a Tennessee military explosives facility killed 16 people, officials announced Saturday.Earlier reports had listed 18 people as missing following Friday’s blast, but Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis clarified at a press conference that two individuals, whose vehicles and personal items were found at the site, were not present when the explosion occurred.The blast occurred around 7:45am local time during an early shift, destroying an entire building on the plant’s campus and scattering debris over at least half a square mile. Residents reported feeling the impact up to 20 miles away, with several mistaking the tremors for an earthquake or meteor strike.“It’s not like working an accident. It’s not like working a tornado. We’re dealing with explosions. And I would say at this time, we’re dealing with remains,” Davis said.Authorities are now using cell tower data and employee records to confirm who was on site at the time of the incident. The FBI and the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives (ATF) have joined the investigation, which will be co-led by local sheriff’s offices.The cause of the explosion remains unknown, and officials said the site remains volatile due to leftover ordnance and unstable chemicals. Controlled detonations are expected as part of the recovery and safety measures.AES manufactures explosives primarily for the US military, including demolition charges and bulk munitions. The company has received several defense contracts, largely from the US army and navy, according to public records. It operates an eight-building facility in a heavily wooded area of Humphreys county.A vigil was held Friday night by community members who gathered to pray and sing hymns like “Amazing Grace.” Sheriff Davis, visibly moved, spoke of the broader impact on the tight-knit community. “We need our communities to come together and understand that we’ve lost a lot of people. This does not only affect those families, it runs deeper … this could be people that you grew up with,” he said.The company, in a statement, called it a “tragic accident” and thanked first responders, “Our thoughts and prayers are with the families, coworkers, and community members affected by this incident,” said Wendall Stinson, CEO of AES.In 2019, AES was cited by OSHA for minor violations related to chemical safety and radiation exposure, according to AP records. The area has also witnessed industrial accidents in the past - including a fatal explosion at another local ammunition facility in 2014.Tennessee governor Bill Lee posted on social media asking for prayers and confirming he is closely monitoring the situation.(With inputs from agencies and CNN)","The blast occurred around 7:45am local time during an early shift, destroying an entire building on the plant’s campus.

'Somebody Is Not...': Trump’s Fiery Reaction To Biden’s Cancer News





Former US president Joe Biden is receiving radiation and hormone treatments for prostate cancer discovered in May, according to a spokesperson's statement on Saturday.""As part of a treatment plan for prostate cancer, President Biden is currently undergoing radiation therapy and hormone treatment,"" the spokesperson confirmed, as quoted by AFP.The 82-year-old former president's office revealed in May that Biden had been diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer that had spread to his bones, following urinary symptoms and the discovery of a prostate nodule. ""Cancer touches us all. Like so many of you, Jill and I have learned that we are strongest in the broken places,"" Biden, whose son Beau Biden succumbed to cancer in 2015, wrote on X platform at the time.""Thank you for lifting us up with love and support,"" he added (at the time).Biden's health became a significant concern following a publication that alleged his deteriorating condition during his campaign for a second presidential term against Donald Trump In July 2024, following a poor debate performance against Trump, Biden withdrew from the race and supported vice president Kamala Harris's presidential bid. Harris subsequently lost to Trump, who commenced his second term in January.The American Cancer Society identifies prostate cancer as the most prevalent cancer among men.The condition is notably frequent in elderly men, with studies indicating approximately 80 percent of men over 80 have cancerous cells in their prostate gland.Despite being highly treatable when detected early, it ranks as the second leading cause of cancer mortality in men, according to the organisation. Hormone therapy, while effective in reducing tumours and slowing cancer progression, does not provide a cure.","Former US president Joe Biden is receiving radiation and hormone treatments for prostate cancer.

Four people were killed and at least 12 others injured in a shooting that broke out early Saturday in downtown Leland, Mississippi, officials said.Leland Mayor John Lee told CBS News that the incident occurred around midnight on the city’s main street, where crowds had gathered for Leland High School’s homecoming weekend. Four of the injured were airlifted to nearby hospitals, though their conditions were not immediately known.Speaking to Fox News Digital, Lee said the shooter had not been identified or taken into custody as of Saturday morning. “Justice will be served,” he said, while expressing condolences to the victims and their families.“I just want to say, you know, our prayers and condolences go out to the family of the deceased and the ones that's been injured and shot,” the mayor added.The Mississippi bureau of investigation said it is assisting local authorities in probing the incident.Mayor Lee described the shooting as a shock to the small community of roughly 4,000 residents in Washington County. “Because this is not something that’s ever happened here before,” he told Fox News Digital, calling for prayers for the city.“It was homecoming weekend, of course, and everybody’s family and friends and neighbors [were] together having fun in the downtown area, as we do every year,” he said.The yearly event attracts hundreds of visitors to the town and serves as a reunion for alumni, who frequently invite their college friends to attend as well.This year's event was described as “picture perfect,” with no signs of the violence that would later unfold, according to school Superintendent Jessie King.“We left there believing we’d check this one off for one in the books,” King told The New York Post.She added that there were “no issues whatsoever. No triggers, no warnings that something like this would take place. The football game and the tailgate on the campus - everyone was having a good time and it closed down in good spirits.”Authorities have not released any details about a possible motive or suspect.

'Corn Pop': Activists strip at Maine School board meeting to protest trans-inclusive sports policy — Video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/corn-pop-activists-strip-at-maine-school-board-meeting-to-protest-trans-inclusive-sports-policy-video/articleshow/124473355.cms,"



Three activists stripped down to their underwear during a Maine school board meeting to protest the district’s trans-inclusive sports policy.The eyebrow-raising protest, led by local firebrand Nick Blanchard (who fittingly goes by “Corn Pop”), took place in Augusta as two women and a man slowly disrobed while Blanchard delivered a dramatic speech.Two women and a man slowly and perfunctorily removed their clothes at the close of the Augusta School Department meeting as Blanchard, who goes by the name “Corn Pop,” delivered an impassioned monologue.“I’m about to show you guys how uncomfortable it is for girls,” Blanchard said as the women disrobed. Two individuals stood in the school board meeting with their shirts removed while board members sat behind a curved wooden desk.“You feel uncomfortable? Because that’s what these young girls feel like when a boy walks into their locker room and starts changing in front of them. That’s what these young girls feel like every time a young boy changes in front of them.” The stunt elicited a range of responses from the school board members, with some outraged, a few averting their gaze, and others remaining entirely unbothered.“This is Maine’s capital,” Blanchard continued. “We should be setting an example for the rest of the state.You know what example you guys are setting? That we do not care about the young girls in the rest of the state.” Following the protest going viral locally, Blanchard stated that more than 150 people have contacted him in support of his stance on the Title IX policy, Central Maine reported.“Do I think these tactics work in a way of changing policy? Probably not,” Blanchard told the outlet.“But the only way to get them to listen to us is to do something crazy and get in the national spotlight.” The Augusta school board voted in favour of their current policy, which adheres to the Maine Human Rights Act. That law allows a student athlete to participate on the team that corresponds with their gender identity, WGME reported.President Trump signed an executive order in February aimed at keeping biological men out of women’s sports through Title IX.The Maine demonstration follows a similar stripping protest in California. Local mother Beth Bourne, who chairs the group Moms for Liberty, undressed down to her underwear at a Davis Joint Unified School Board meeting on September 18 to protest the allowance of transgender students to use girls’ locker rooms.Multiple individual school districts in both Maine and California have passed resolutions to support compliance with Trump’s executive order, Fox News reported.","Nick Blanchard, who goes by Corn Pop, led the protest in Augusta, Maine.
