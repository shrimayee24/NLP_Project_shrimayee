Seelampur teen murder: 'Lady Don' held as cops probe gang rivalry angle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lady-don-under-lens-as-gang-revenge-angle-emerges-in-delhi-teens-murder/articleshow/120409591.cms,"Photo: X

NEW DELHI: A 17-year-old boy named Kunal was fatally stabbed in north-east Delhi’s New Seelampur on Thursday evening, triggering tensions in the area. According to police, a local woman named Zikra, allegedly known as the 'lady don', has been detained and is being investigated in connection with the murder.Kunal’s family has alleged that Zikra, who once worked as a bouncer for jailed gangster Hashim Baba's wife Zoya, was present at the scene when he was killed.“Zikra used to roam around in the area with a pistol. An incident happened with her cousin Sahil but my son was not involved in it. Yet they killed him. They brutally stabbed him multiple times,” Kunal’s mother Parveen told news agency PTI.Zikra was reportedly living with Zoya before the latter’s arrest by Delhi Police in a drug-related case. After Zoya was jailed, Zikra was said to be forming her own gang.She was previously arrested under the Arms Act after she posted a video on social media brandishing a pistol. She is currently out on bail and had been living in a rented house close to Kunal’s residence.Joint Commissioner of Police (Eastern Range) Pushpendra Kumar said, “We have identified the accused who will be nabbed soon. Ten teams have been formed to crack the case, and they are looking at all possible angles. We have detained a few people for questioning. The case will be solved soon.”CCTV footage led the police to identify two suspects, Sahil and Rehan, in connection with the stabbing. According to sources, Zikra has been detained for questioning, although no formal arrest has been made yet.The motive behind the murder appears to be an act of revenge. Sources revealed that Kunal may have been involved in an earlier attack on Zikra’s cousin Sahil. Police had registered an attempt to murder case against some members of Kunal’s community over that previous incident.“It is suspected that Kunal was also involved in the stabbing of Sahil. Although Sahil did not die, he, along with Zikra, hatched a plan to take revenge for the attack,” said a family source.Zikra reportedly was leading a gang of 10-12 youths, several of whom are now under scrutiny in connection with Kunal’s killing. Fear has reportedly gripped the locality, with some residents allegedly fleeing the area to escape possible retaliation.Amid growing unrest, local police and the Rapid Action Force (RAF) have been deployed to maintain order. Protests have been staged by local people and members of Hindu outfits, including the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP). Posters bearing slogans like ""Hindus are migrating"" and ""Please help, Yoji ji"" appeared in the area but were later removed by police.The incident has further escalated tensions between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), with both blaming each other for the breakdown of law and order in the national capital.","A 17-year-old boy named Kunal was fatally stabbed in north-east Delhi’s New Seelampur.

Clad in traditional Bengali attire and a ceremonial ‘topor,’ Ghosh appeared before the media after the rituals and thanked well-wishers, including chief minister Mamata Banerjee.“I thank everyone for their blessings. My personal life will not impact my political responsibilities,” said the 60-year-old leader, adding that he fulfilled his mother’s long-standing wish by getting married.This is Ghosh’s first marriage and Majumdar’s second. She has a son from her previous marriage. The couple reportedly met during morning walks at Eco Park in 2021 and decided to formalize their relationship earlier this month during an IPL match in Kolkata. “I proposed, and I’m proud he eventually accepted,” said Majumdar, 51.Senior BJP leaders, including state unit chief Sukanta Majumdar, visited the couple to extend their greetings. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee also sent flowers and a congratulatory note, though Leader of the Opposition Suvendu Adhikari declined to comment.The wedding, held as per Vedic rituals, was attended only by close family. Ghosh is scheduled to visit his hometown Kharagpur on Saturday and may join a political event in Dumdum, party sources said. When asked about honeymoon plans, he quipped, “It will happen somewhere in India.”TMC leader Kunal Ghosh, in a playful post on X, remarked that since Eco Park — where the couple first met — was Mamata Banerjee’s creation, her “role” in the union was “undeniable.”","Former West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh married party colleague Rinku Majumdar in a private ceremony at his New Town residence near Kolkata on Friday.

Cracks in INIDA bloc?

NEW DELHI: West Bengal governor CV Ananda Bose on Friday visited Malda to meet the Murshidabad riot-affected victims, who had to flee the district after violent clashes occurred during the anti-Waqf law protest last week.The governor, after the visit, claimed that women told him ""they were intimidated"" and that ""miscreants came into their houses and they were physically assaulted, abusive words were used"".Assuring proactive action, Bose said he had a detailed discussion with the victims in the camp where they have been staying as a temporary arrangement.""I met the family members who are in this camp. I had a detailed discussion with them. I listened to their grievances and understood their feelings. They also informed me of their requirements. Certainly, proactive action will be taken,"" the West Bengal governor, who ignored CM Mamata Banerjee 's request to postpone the visit, told news agency ANI.According to several reports, Bose is set to visit Murshidabad on Saturday, where the violence broke out, killing three people and injuring several others.Displaced residents taking refuge at a relief camp set up on the premises of Parlalpur High School in Malda claimed they were being ""confined"" and barred from leaving the campus or contacting their relatives.Tensions reportedly rose at the camp in Baishnabnagar when police restricted journalists from entering during the visit of Bose. The move sparked protests from the displaced people, who expressed frustration over the lack of communication and transparency.""We have been confined by police here and cannot move freely,"" alleged one of the camp inmates, according to ANI.""We are not allowed to go out or interact with our relatives here. We do not know why the media is not allowed inside when the governor is here and talking to us. We want the world to know about our talks with him,"" the inmate alleged.A team from the National Commission for Women (NCW), headed by chairperson Vijaya Rahatkar, also visited the Malda relief camp. The delegation reviewed the condition of women who were affected by the violence that followed anti-Waqf law protests .Expressing shock at the situation faced by the displaced women, Rahatkar said: ""I have met and interacted with women and children here at the camp. They have shared the situations they had faced. These women and children faced a lot of problems and they were forcibly evicted. What they had gone through is beyond imagination.""NCW member Archana Majumdar, who accompanied Rahatkar, alleged that the women were molested and forcibly thrown out of their homes.""It is the duty of the state government to protect them. What are they doing? Is the TMC government planning to turn West Bengal into a second Bangladesh?"" Majumdar said, lashing out at the state administration’s handling of the crisis.The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) announced plans to hold a nationwide protest on Saturday, demanding the imposition of President's rule in the state. The Hindu outfit's president Alok Kumar said that the organisation’s members and supporters will stage dharnas at district headquarters across the country to protest the unrest in Murshidabad.""We will give memoranda to the district magistrates demanding that the central government contemplate the imposition of President's rule in West Bengal ,"" Kumar told news agency PTI.Referring to a meeting between CM Mamata Banerjee and Muslim clerics, Kumar noted her remark that the Murshidabad violence was ""pre-planned.""""If it is pre-planned, did the state intelligence agencies give any prior information to her government? And if not, who is responsible for such failure?"" he asked. ""If there was any report, why were precautionary measures to prevent the violence not taken?"" Kumar added.While the Trinamool Congress (TMC) accused the BJP of doing ""politics"" instead of taking appropriate steps, its ally Congress has planned a visit to the affected areas, which might not go well with Mamata.Kalyan Banerjee on Friday attacked Union home minister Amit Shah and accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of doing ""politics"" instead of taking appropriate steps.""They (BJP) have been demanding President's rule (in West Bengal) since 2019. This is their routine demand. We do not give this demand any importance. The matter (Bengal violence) is going on in the High Court. The High Court is satisfied with the steps taken by us. The situation was definitely bad, but it has improved due to the steps taken by the state government and the state government also took the help of central paramilitary forces. All forces worked together and peace has been restored,"" Banerjee told ANI on the Murshidabad Violence.He further stated that all forces had worked together, and peace had been restored in the city.""Everything is normal in Murshidabad district... BJP is trying to do politics. Amit Shah is also engaging in politics instead of taking the necessary steps...They hatched a plan to indulge in riots,"" he added.Meanwhile, a delegation of the Congress, led by its West Bengal unit president Subhankar Sarkar, will visit riot-affected Shamsherganj in Murshidabad district on Saturday and review the situation there.During the visit to Shamsherganj around 2 PM, Sarkar will be accompanied by Malda Dakshin MP Isha Khan Choudhury, AICC observer Amba Prasad and other party leaders, he said.""We will go to the riot-hit areas of Shamsherganj and those around it tomorrow.

No, the central government should have the final say Yes, states should have more control

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin on Friday hit out at the central government, asserting that the state would never bow to the authority of New Delhi. Reaffirming the state’s independent political stance, Stalin said ""Tamil Nadu will never yield to Delhi's administration "".“Union Minister Amit Shah says they will form a government here in 2026. I challenge him - Tamil Nadu will never yield to Delhi’s rule. That may work elsewhere through party poaching and raids, but not here. This formula won’t work in Tamil Nadu,” Stalin declared at a rally in Tiruvallur.He also questioned Union home minister Amit Shah on key issues affecting the state, including the Neet examination and language imposition. “Can Amit Shah guarantee an exemption from Neet? Can he promise that Hindi will not be imposed? Has the Centre provided special funds to Tamil Nadu? Can he assure that delimitation won’t reduce our parliamentary seats?” Stalin asked.Responding to recent controversial remarks by Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, who called the Tamil Nadu government “dishonest” and its people “uncivilised,” Stalin said such attempts to divide the state through political rhetoric would fail. “Even the Prime Minister in Odisha made disparaging remarks about Tamilians. These tactics won’t work here. Tamil Nadu cannot be divided through politics,” he said.Earlier this week, Stalin had intensified his campaign for greater autonomy for Tamil Nadu, following repeated clashes between the DMK government and Governor RN Ravi over pending legislation. On April 15, he moved a resolution in the state assembly to form a high-level committee tasked with recommending ways to enhance the state’s powers and reclaim its rights.The committee, headed by former Supreme Court Justice Kurian Joseph, will include retired IAS officer Ashok Vardhan Shetty and scholar Mu Nagarajan. It is expected to submit an interim report by January 2026 and a final report within two years, with a focus on strengthening state–Centre relations.",Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin hit out at the central government.

JAMMU: The Army on Friday ordered an inquiry after an Ignou professor accused troops of assaulting him without any provocation during a checking of vehicles in Rajouri district of Jammu and Kashmir late Thursday night.Officials said the professor, Liaqat Ali, allegedly suffered head injuries in the assault that took place near the border village of Laam in Nowshera. A purported video showing a bleeding Ali had surfaced online.An Army statement suggested the victim had tried to snatch the weapon of troops, and might have sustained injuries during the scuffle. “An incident has come to light wherein certain individuals were allegedly manhandled by Army personnel in Rajouri district. The Army had input on the likely movement of terrorists in a vehicle in this sensitive area. Accordingly, search operations were being conducted. Preliminary information suggests that on being stopped, the individual tried to snatch weapons of the soldiers on duty and initiated a scuffle with them. However, an inquiry has been initiated,” an Army spokesperson said in a statement in Jammu.“Should any personnel be found guilty of misconduct, strict action will be taken in accordance with the existing law. The Army remains steadfast in upholding the highest standards of professionalism and discipline in the conduct of counter-terror operations. All sections of society are requested to continue to cooperate and collaborate with the Indian Army for collective and comprehensive security in this sensitive area,” the statement added.The incident allegedly took place when the professor, accompanied by his brothers and other relatives, were returning to Kalakote after attending a pre-wedding ceremony of his sister.Sharing the video, which shows a bleeding Ali and others arguing with the troops, on her X handle, PDP president Mehbooba Mufti said in a post: “This shocking act has shattered a common man’s faith — especially painful given that the victim’s family has proudly served in the Indian Army.

SRINAGAR: Mirwaiz Umar Farooq , Kashmir’s chief cleric and chairman of Hurriyat Conference , was placed under house arrest and not allowed to offer Friday prayers at Srinagar’s Jamia Masjid .“Every Friday, I am put under arbitrary house arrest,” Mirwaiz said. J&K police had not issued any statement on the arrest, although Mirwaiz has been put in such confinement ahead of Friday prayers on several occasions.Mirwaiz alleged that the aim was to put pressure on him not to speak at the prayers. “The ban (on sermons) aims to weaken the centrality of Muslim institutions of the Valley, Jamia Masjid, office of Mirwaiz, and cause collective grief to Muslims and all those who oppose this authoritarian and sectarian outlook,” Mirwaiz added.Since his release in Sept 2023 after prolonged house arrest following abrogation of Article 370, Mirwaiz has been allowed to offer Friday prayers at times and barred on other occasions. Police usually don’t come up with any statement on the issue.This time, governing National Conference (NC) spokesman Tanvir Sadiq described the curbs on Mirwaiz as “unjust.” “Preventing a religious leader from carrying out his religious obligations is deeply unjust. Genuine normalcy must extend to everyone without exception,” Sadiq posted.Anjuman Auqaf Jamia Masjid, which manages the mosque, expressed “deep anguish”.

Though he has not been charged with any gang-related crimes, his alleged affiliation with the notorious group has complicated his case. Legal hurdles: Garcia’s legal situation is clouded by conflicting rulings. In 2019, an immigration judge granted him protection from deportation to El Salvador, acknowledging the risk of harm there. However, an administrative error by ICE led to his wrongful deportation. Despite court orders demanding his return, the Trump administration has resisted compliance, leading to a drawn-out legal battle.

Timeline of Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s case



March 12, 2025

Kilmar Abrego Garcia was stopped by immigration agents who wrongly told him that his status had changed, court documents show.



He had ""withholding from removal"" status, which means he was allowed to stay in the US because of the likelihood that he'd face harm in El Salvador.



Ábrego García was questioned about gang affiliation and then transferred to a Texas detention center.



Kilmar Abrego Garcia arrested by ICE in Baltimore.





March 15, 2025

Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador: DOJ.



Although ""ICE was aware of his protection from removal to El Salvador, Ábrego García was removed to El Salvador because of an administrative error,"" DOJ attorneys said in a filing.





March 24, 2025

Jennifer Vasquez Sura, Abrego Garcia's wife, files an affidavit.





March 31, 2025

The Atlantic first reports on Abrego Garcia's imprisonment over ""administrative error.""



The DOJ admitted in court papers that the Salvadorian national living in Maryland legally was wrongly deported.





April 4, 2025

Judge Xinis ordered the Trump administration to return Ábrego García from an El Salvador prison to the US by midnight on April 7.





April 7, 2025

The Supreme Court temporarily paused a federal judge's midnight deadline to return Ábrego García to the US while the justices weighed the case.



The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals earlier the same day refused to block Xinis' order.





April 10, 2025

The Supreme Court ruled in an unsigned order with no dissenting votes that the Trump administration must take steps to ""facilitate"" Ábrego García's release from custody.



The high court said the government must ensure his case is ""handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.""





April 11, 2025

A federal judge demanded the government provide daily updates in Ábrego García's case.



US District Judge Paula Xinis said this should include sharing information on Ábrego García's location plus steps it has already taken to return him to the US and steps it will take moving forward.





April 12, 2025

Ábrego García's attorneys in a court filing highlighted Trump's comments a day earlier that he would ""bring somebody back"" if the Supreme Court directed it.



The lawyers in a motion to the judge overseeing the case characterised this statement as an acknowledgment that the US ""has the power to facilitate Abrego Garcia's release from prison and return"" him.



Despite Trump's acknowledgment, Ábrego García's attorneys argued, the DOJ ""and other Government agencies continue to resist this Court and the Supreme Court.""





April 13, 2025

DOJ attorneys said in a court filing, ""The federal courts have no authority to direct the executive branch to conduct foreign relations in a particular way, or engage with a foreign sovereign in a given manner.""



They added, ""That is the 'exclusive power of the president as the sole organ of the federal government in the field of international relations.""





April 14, 2025

El Salvador President Nayib Bukele said he can't return Ábrego García, to the US , nor will he release him within the country.



""The question is preposterous,"" Bukele said during a press conference with President Trump. ""How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States? I don't have the power to return him.""



El Salvadorian president visits White House, says he won't return or release Abrego Garcia.





April 15, 2025

The DOJ said in a court filing that if Ábrego García returns to the US , he will be detained and removed from the country.



He will either be sent to a country that's not El Salvador, or the government will seek to ""terminate"" his ""withholding of removal"" status and send him back to El Salvador, the filing states.



A federal judge later that day wouldn't rule out holding the government in contempt of court, per multiple reports.





April 16, 2025

El Salvador's government denied a request from Van Hollen to see or speak to Ábrego García, the senator said during a visit to the country.



Van Hollen said he asked El Salvador Vice President Félix Ulloa why his constituent is being held if US courts and El Salvador's government had found no evidence that Ábrego García is a member of the MS-13 gang.



""His answer was that the Trump administration is paying El Salvador, the government of El Salvador to keep him at CECOT,"" the senator said.





April 17, 2025

Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) visited Ábrego García at the Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo (CECOT) prison where his constituent is being held, hours after being denied entry for a second time.



A federal appeals court earlier that day rejected a Trump administration request to block a lower court's order requiring his return.





April 18, 2025

Fresh images of Kilmar Ábrego García surfaced after El Salvador President Nayib Bukele posted photos of him ""sipping margaritas with Sen. Van Hollen in the tropical paradise of El Salvador!🍹""



Bukele wrote on X: “Now that he’s been confirmed healthy, he gets the honor of staying in El Salvador’s custody. Kilmar Abrego Garcia, miraculously risen from the ‘death camps’ & ‘torture’, now sipping margaritas with Sen. Van Hollen…”



Sen. Van Hollen confirmed meeting Ábrego García and said he called his wife to “pass along his message of love.”

Van Hollen also said soldiers had earlier blocked his vehicle ""just kilometres from the facility.""



El Salvador’s Vice President Félix Ulloa reportedly told Van Hollen that their government has no intention of sending him back.

Here are the key reasons why his return to the US remains uncertain:Also read: 'How can I smuggle a terrorist into US': El Salvador president refuses to return Maryland man after wrongful deportation The US Supreme Court recently ruled that the Trump administration must facilitate Garcia’s return, but the government continues to resist, citing concerns over international relations.

A major outrage began on social media when an abuser, a woman, was identified as Priya Sharma and her Hindu background was slammed for the abuses she hurled in a video going viral. California police launched a hate crime investigation reacting to the viral video where a woman sitting inside the car was calling a black woman 'ni**er' over a parking issue. According to reports, the incident took place at the parking lot in the Bay Area over the weekend. The attacker also mentioned the 'fake a**' eyelashes of the black woman.""Due to the nature of the verbal exchange between the involved parties, the incident has been classified as a hate incident and is currently under investigation by the department’s criminal investigation bureau,"" the Pinole Police Department said in a statement.The victim of the verbal abuse broke her silence and told KYVU that the attack was quite unfortunate. “It's quite unfortunate the verbiage she was using. It's unacceptable,” she told KTVU under the conditions of anonymity. “I don't understand why she was using it towards anybody in public at all. She's obviously not supposed to be using that type of vulgar language.”The woman who used the racial slurs allegedly has a pending criminal case, charged with repeatedly stealing from a beauty store in Concord, reports said.As many concluded that the abuser looked Indian, one social media post identified her as Priya Sharma and several social media accounts spread the misinformation, slamming Priya Sharma's Hindu background. ""Meet Priya Sharma Hindu who spreads casteism in the country and racism in America,"" one post read.Other social media users debunked the claim and said the woman was not Priya Sharma, but Natasha Chand, a Christian from Fiji -- possibly an Indo-Fijian.

Thousands of Robert F Kennedy documents declassified under Trump executive order,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/thousands-of-rfk-documents-declassified-under-trump-executive-order/articleshow/120412753.cms,"Donald Trump

The Trump administration released approximately 10,000 pages of previously classified documents relating to the 1968 assassination of Senator Robert F Kennedy, opening the door for renewed public scrutiny of the decades-old case. The files, published on the US National Archives website on Friday, mark a significant step in President Donald Trump's push for transparency around some of America's most controversial political killings.The move follows an executive order signed by Trump in January calling for the declassification of records concerning the assassinations of RFK, President John F. Kennedy, and the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The National Archives confirmed that the documents would continue to be released on a rolling basis in partnership with various federal agencies.The document collection, as per CBS News' report, encompasses various materials related to the RFK assassination case. These include Sirhan's personal handwritten notes, statements from witnesses, photographic evidence from both the crime scene and autopsy, FBI documentation tracking Sirhan's movements prior to the incident, public letters sent to government officials regarding the assassination, and recorded conversations with Sirhan's relatives.Senator Kennedy, a Democratic presidential hopeful at the time, was fatally shot on June 5, 1968, at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles after winning California’s Democratic primary. Sirhan Sirhan was convicted of his murder and is currently serving a life sentence. However, RFK’s son, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has long raised doubts about Sirhan’s guilt and welcomed the document release.“Lifting the veil on the RFK papers is a necessary step toward restoring trust in American government,” Kennedy Jr. said in a statement, thanking both Trump and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard for their efforts.Gabbard, who led the interagency declassification process, said, “Nearly 60 years after the tragic assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy, the American people will, for the first time, have the opportunity to review the federal government’s investigation thanks to the leadership of President Trump.”While many of the files had been transferred to the National Archives decades ago, they had remained inaccessible to the public until now. The newly released material includes FBI and Justice Department memos, photographs of evidence, news clippings, and handwritten notes. Some records had to be re-scanned in colour due to legibility issues in earlier black-and-white versions.Although it's unclear whether these files contain any explosive revelations, their release coincides with broader efforts by the Trump administration to declassify records tied to historic political events. Trump had previously authorised the release of documents related to President John F. Kennedy’s 1963 assassination and promised more disclosures on Dr. King’s killing.","10,000 pages of previously classified documents relating to the 1968 assassination of Senator Robert F Kennedy have been released.

Why was White House press briefing interrupted during Dr Oz’s swearing-in; Trump was mid-Iran remarks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-the-white-house-press-briefing-was-interrupted-during-dr-ozs-swearing-in-trump-was-mid-iran-remarks/articleshow/120422199.cms,"President Trump swears in Dr. Oz, discusses Iran & migrants | LiveNOW from FOX





A White House press briefing held after Dr Mehmet Oz’s swearing-in as administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) was abruptly cut short on Friday following a medical emergency involving a child.The incident occurred in the Oval Office shortly after Dr Oz, a former heart surgeon and television personality, formally took the oath of office. While President Donald Trump was answering questions about Iran’s nuclear programme, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt urgently intervened. “Press out! Everybody get out, right now!” she told reporters, prompting confusion in the room.Moments before the interruption, Donald Trump had been addressing Iran’s nuclear ambitions: “I’m for stopping Iran very simply from having a nuclear weapon. They can’t have a nuclear weapon. I want Iran to be great and prosperous and terrific,” he said, adding that during his administration, Iran was “broke” and unable to fund groups like Hamas and Hezbollah. He blamed President Biden for reversing sanctions: “Biden came in. He took all the sanctions off. China wasn’t allowed to buy... I said if you buy one barrel of oil from Iran, you can’t do business in the United States.”The president continued, warning, “With Iran, they can’t have a nuclear weapon, and if they have a nuclear weapon, you’ll all be very unhappy.”He also briefly mentioned ongoing US-China communications, describing them as “really very good,” just seconds before the medical emergency brought the press event to an end.The disruption was caused by a young girl—later confirmed to be a member of Dr Oz’s family—who suddenly collapsed. Dr Oz quickly moved to assist her. Though she managed to stand, she appeared disoriented and was helped out of the room. Officials later confirmed that she was fine, but did not release her identity.The ceremony had just concluded minutes earlier, with Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr administering the oath while Trump looked on. The president praised Oz for his “big commitment,” reaffirming his administration's position: “no cuts” to Medicare and Medicaid .Dr Oz, 64, now leads CMS, the federal agency responsible for overseeing health coverage for nearly half of the US population, including programmes like Medicare, Medicaid, and plans under the Affordable Care Act. His appointment comes amid growing concerns over potential Medicaid cuts as Congress debates budget priorities.The unexpected turn of events briefly overshadowed the significance of the moment, but the White House later assured the public that the child had recovered. The briefing did not resume following the disruption.","A White House press briefing held after Dr Mehmet Oz’s swearing-in was abruptly cut short on Friday following a medical emergency involving a child.

Senator Chris Van Hollen on Friday accused El Salvador ’s President Nayib Bukele of staging a deceptive media stunt during his meeting with Kilmar Abrego Garcia — a man the US government wrongfully deported under the Trump administration — by planting margarita glasses on the table to falsely suggest a casual, celebratory encounter.Speaking to reporters at Dulles International Airport on Friday after returning from a visit to El Salvador, the Maryland Democrat said the Salvadoran government attempted to downplay the seriousness of Abrego Garcia’s detention at the notorious CECOT prison by orchestrating misleading visuals. “They wanted to create this appearance that life was just lovely for Kilmar, which of course is a big, fat lie,” Van Hollen said.Van Hollen and Abrego Garcia, who had not spoken to anyone outside prison since his deportation , met Thursday night at a hotel. Initially, only water was on the table. But Van Hollen said two additional glasses were later placed by a Salvadoran official — one seemingly a margarita with a salted rim and the other a similar-looking drink.“Let me just be very clear: Neither of us touched the drinks that were in front of us,” Van Hollen said. “Nobody drank any margaritas or sugar water or whatever it is.”The senator pointed out that the stunt appeared designed to suggest Abrego Garcia — who had spent time in one of Latin America’s harshest prisons — was relaxed and well-treated, despite evidence to the contrary. He even noted that the initial proposal was to hold the meeting beside a hotel pool, adding, “This is a guy who’s been in CECOT, this is a guy who’s been detained.”Van Hollen turned what might have been dismissed as a social media rumour into a pointed critique of Bukele’s administration and its public relations tactics, suggesting it was an attempt to mask systemic abuses and whitewash the state’s treatment of detainees.Also read: What Donald Trump said in first reaction on deported Maryland man Kilmar Abrego Garcia linked to MS-13 “If you want to play a little Sherlock Holmes, I’ll tell you how you can,” he said, referring to the untouched rims of the glasses. “You would see a gap. There’s no gap.”The US government has acknowledged that Abrego Garcia’s deportation was a mistake. Van Hollen said the purpose of the meeting was to assess Abrego Garcia’s health and condition. The former detainee told him he had recently been moved out of CECOT and was doing well — a rare glimpse into the fate of deportees caught at the intersection of US immigration policy and Central American politics.",Senator Chris Van Hollen accused El Salvador ’s President Nayib Bukele of staging a deceptive media stunt during his meeting with Kilmar Abrego Garcia.

'Now sipping margaritas with senator': Fresh images of deported US resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia amid legal row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/now-sipping-margaritas-with-senator-fresh-images-of-deported-us-resident-kilmar-abrego-garcia-amid-legal-row/articleshow/120397168.cms,"Fresh images of deported Maryland resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia emerged Thursday after El Salvador President Nayib Bukele posted photos of him sipping margaritas with US Senator Chris Van Hollen , sparking a new wave of controversy around the 29-year-old’s detention.Bukele in a post on X said, “Now that he’s been confirmed healthy, he gets the honor of staying in El Salvador’s custody. Kilmar Abrego Garcia, miraculously risen from the ‘death camps’ & ‘torture’, now sipping margaritas with Sen. Van Hollen in the tropical paradise of El Salvador!🍹”The meeting comes months after Abrego Garcia was deported in March by the Trump administration despite an active immigration court order blocking his removal. His lawyers have since been fighting for his return to the United States, accusing the administration of violating due process and international law.Sen. Van Hollen, who travelled to El Salvador this week to push for Abrego Garcia’s release, said he met the detainee on Thursday and called his wife to “pass along his message of love.” Earlier that day, Van Hollen said he was denied access to the high-security CECOT prison, where he believes Abrego Garcia had been held.“They stopped us because they are under orders not to allow us to proceed,” the senator said, describing how soldiers turned his vehicle away just kilometres from the facility.The Trump administration acknowledged the deportation as a “mistake” and the US Supreme Court has urged officials to facilitate Abrego Garcia’s return. However, El Salvador’s Vice President Félix Ulloa reportedly told Van Hollen that their government has no intention of sending him back.Meanwhile, human rights groups have accused President Bukele’s administration of mistreating detainees in the country’s sprawling gang prison system. Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national and former Maryland resident, has not been charged with any crime in the US , though Trump officials have claimed he has ties to the MS-13 gang — allegations his lawyers say remain unsubstantiated.“This is about due process and the rule of law,” Van Hollen said. “We won’t give up until Kilmar has his due process rights respected.”The senator’s visit has deepened partisan tensions back home. While Democrats argue the deportation exemplifies the Trump administration’s disregard for court orders, Republicans have rallied around the crackdown. GOP lawmakers, including Rep. Riley Moore of West Virginia and Rep. Jason Smith of Missouri, have toured the CECOT prison in support of Trump's immigration policy. Moore wrote on social media that the facility “houses the country’s most brutal criminals,” while Smith praised Trump for its expansion to include “illegal immigrants who broke into our country and committed violent acts against Americans.”More Democratic lawmakers, including Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, are reportedly planning similar visits. Since March, El Salvador has received over 200 deportees from the US , many accused of gang affiliations, and detained them in the controversial maximum-security prison outside San Salvador.Court documents show the US government has repeatedly declined to disclose its plans for Abrego Garcia’s repatriation, further fuelling legal battles and international scrutiny over the case.","El Salvador President Nayib Bukele posted photos of Kilmar Abrego Garcia sipping margaritas with US Senator Chris Van Hollen.

Poll What should be the top priority in global conflict resolution? Strategic resource agreements Ceasefire and peace talks

US secretary of state Marco Rubio on Friday warned that Washington could walk away from its push to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine within days, unless progress becomes visible soon.Speaking in Paris after high-level discussions with European and Ukrainian leaders, Rubio said the Trump administration was assessing whether the effort remains viable.“We're not going to continue with this endeavour for weeks and months on end,” Rubio said. “So we need to determine very quickly now, and I'm talking about a matter of days whether or not this is doable in the next few weeks. If it is, we're in. If it's not, then we have other priorities to focus on as well”, he added.The comments came following meetings hosted by France, the first since US President Donald Trump’s inauguration where top American, European and Ukrainian officials convened to discuss ending the war.According to news agency AP, French officials expect a follow-up meeting in London early next week, which Rubio said he may attend.Despite acknowledging “constructive” talks and an emerging outline for a peace framework, Rubio stressed urgency. “We need to figure out here now within a matter of days whether this is doable in the short term, because if it's not, then I think we're just going to move on,” he told reporters at Le Bourget airport.Efforts by Rubio and Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff have included multiple rounds of negotiation in Saudi Arabia and at least three meetings between Witkoff and Russian President Vladimir Putin However, Russia has so far refused a comprehensive ceasefire proposed by Trump and supported by Ukraine, demanding Kyiv halt military mobilisation and Western arms supplies, conditions rejected by Ukraine.Trump, who had pledged during his campaign to end the war within 24 hours of taking office, later said a deal could come by April or May. But talks have dragged amid escalating disagreements, including a public spat in February between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House.Trump added fuel to the tension Thursday by saying, “I don't hold Zelenskyy responsible but I'm not exactly thrilled with the fact that that war started”. He added, “I'm not blaming him, but what I am saying is that I wouldn't say he's done the greatest job, OK? I am not a big fan.”Zelenskyy, earlier in the week, invited Trump to visit Ukraine to witness the war's destruction firsthand, an invitation that Trump dismissed with threats directed at CBS, which aired the Ukrainian president’s interview.Meanwhile, both sides have moved closer to a controversial minerals agreement.According to The New York Times, a memorandum of understanding was signed Thursday between Kyiv and Washington, paving the way for a future deal on Ukraine’s strategic resources.","US secretary of state Marco Rubio warned that Washington could walk away from its push to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine within days.

Chicago shooting in Lincoln Park leaves man dead; 2 seen fleeing scene

Kevin Patel, a 28-year-old man, was shot and killed in Chicago’s Lincoln Park neighbourhood on Wednesday night.According to the Chicago police department, the shooting happened around 9:20 pm in the 800-block of West Lill Avenue. Officers responded to reports of gunfire and found Patel lying on the sidewalk with a gunshot wound to the chest. He was rushed to Illinois Masonic Medical Center, where he later died. The Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office later confirmed his identity.Garrett Moores, a neighbour who rushed to Patel's side, described the desperate attempt to save his life. “I grabbed towels and ran down,” he said. Guided by a 911 operator, Moores and another neighbour tried chest compressions and worked to keep Patel conscious. “You almost build a personal connection in those moments. It was devastating,” Moores added, reported ABC 7 Chicago.The incident happened just yards away from 43rd Ward Alderman Timmy Knudsen’s office. He addressed the violence in a statement, calling it a reminder of the ongoing fight against citywide crime. He said he has asked for increased patrols and more support from City Hall, especially with summer approaching.Witnesses reported seeing a man and a woman running from the area shortly before police arrived. No arrests have been made, and Area Three detectives are continuing the investigation.","Kevin Patel, a 28-year-old man, was shot and killed in Chicago’s Lincoln Park neighbourhood on Wednesday night.

"White House revamps Covid-19 website to promote ‘lab-leak’ theory, targets Fauci and Biden",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/white-house-revamps-covid-19-website-to-promote-lab-leak-theory-targets-fauci-and-biden/articleshow/120420902.cms,"The website lists five key points, suggesting that Covid-19's origins were not natural.



The White House on Friday launched a revamped version of its Covid-19 website, placing the controversial lab-leak theory at the centre of its narrative on the pandemic’s origins. The update marks a sharp shift in tone, accusing former president Joe Biden and his top medical advisor, Dr Anthony Fauci , of suppressing debate over the virus's origin and mishandling pandemic responses.The new page on Covid.gov, which previously served as a public resource for vaccines and testing, now features a prominent image of President Donald Trump and a banner declaring: “LAB LEAK, The True Origins of Covid-19.”""This website shows the true origins of Covid-19 and how Democrats and the media discredited alternative health treatments and the lab-leak theory,"" the White House said in a statement.The site outlines five key arguments to support the lab-leak claim, citing Wuhan’s proximity to China’s top SARS research lab, claims of inadequate biosafety protocols, and assertions that early infections stemmed from a single introduction into humans—suggesting a controlled environment rather than natural spillover.""The Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2 publication, which was used repeatedly by public health officials and the media to discredit the lab-leak theory, was promoted by Dr. Fauci to push the preferred narrative that Covid-19 originated naturally,"" the site alleges.It also accuses Biden-era public health officials of censoring dissent and engaging in a “multi-year campaign of delay, confusion and non-responsiveness.”The move comes weeks after the CIA updated its assessment, stating it was now “more likely” that the virus leaked from a Chinese lab—reversing its earlier position that there was insufficient evidence to determine Covid-19’s origin. The FBI and the Department of Energy had previously expressed similar views, although confidence levels vary.China has repeatedly rejected the lab-leak theory, calling it “extremely unlikely,” and urged the United States to stop politicising the issue of origin tracing.The updated site also criticises early pandemic measures such as mask mandates and social distancing, and features an animated map of Wuhan. A section titled “Covid-19 misinformation” accuses the previous administration of colluding with social media platforms to suppress alternative views and promote only official guidance.Jamie Metzl, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said: “I welcome all efforts to dig deeper. But it would be a terrible shame if such efforts distracted from essential work to help prevent further infections and treat people suffering from Covid-19 and long Covid,” speaking to NPR.The rollout of the site comes amid sweeping restructuring efforts at US health agencies under Trump’s administration, with around 10,000 job cuts reportedly planned. Health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., known for his vaccine scepticism, has said the shake-up is part of a wider push to prioritise chronic disease prevention.Covid-19 and related illnesses have claimed more than one million lives in the US, with millions more affected worldwide.1. The virus possesses a biological characteristic that is not found in nature.2. According to the data, all cases of Covid-19 stem from a single introduction into humans, which is contrary to previous pandemics, where there were multiple spillover events.3. Wuhan is home to China’s foremost SARS research lab, which has a history of conducting gain-of-function research (gene altering and organism supercharging) without adequate biosafety.4. The researchers at Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) were sick with Covid-like symptoms in the fall of 2019, months before Covid-19 was discovered at the wet market.5. The website asserts that if there were evidence supporting a natural origin for Covid-19, it would have emerged by now. The lack of such evidence, according to the site, further strengthens the lab-leak theory.","Covid-19 and related illnesses have claimed more than one million lives in the US, with millions more affected worldwide.

What Donald Trump said in first reaction on deported Maryland man Kilmar Abrego Garcia linked to MS-13,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-donald-trump-said-in-first-reaction-on-deported-maryland-man-linked-to-ms-13-kilmar-abrego-garcia/articleshow/120420017.cms,"US President Donald Trump on Friday defended the controversial deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia , a Maryland resident sent to El Salvador last month despite a court order protecting him from removal.Sharing a photo of a tattooed hand allegedly belonging to Abrego Garcia, Trump said, “This is the hand of the man that the Democrats feel should be brought back to the United States, because he is such ‘a fine and innocent person.’ They said he is not a member of MS-13, even though he’s got MS-13 tattooed onto his knuckles... I must be allowed to do my job. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”Trump's remarks came amid renewed political controversy following the release of fresh images of Abrego Garcia, who appeared relaxed and smiling while sipping margaritas with Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen in El Salvador.The images were posted on X by El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, who mocked earlier claims that Abrego Garcia was being tortured, saying: “Kilmar Abrego Garcia, miraculously risen from the ‘death camps’ & ‘torture’, now sipping margaritas with Sen. Van Hollen.”Meanwhile, Donald Trump intensified his criticism of the Biden administration and said, ""Sleepy Joe Biden, THE WORST PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES, has allowed millions and millions of Criminals, many of them murderers, drug dealers, and people released from prisons and mental institutions from all around the world, to enter our Country through it’s very dangerous and ill conceived Open Border. Sorry, but it’s my job to get these killers and thugs out of here. THAT’S WHAT I GOT ELECTED TO DO. MAGA!""Abrego Garcia, 29, was deported on March 15 despite an active US immigration court order blocking his removal. His lawyers claim the deportation violated both due process and international law. The US Supreme Court has upheld a lower court's ruling demanding efforts to return him, but White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt insisted Wednesday that “Abrego Garcia will never live in the United States of America,” alleging MS-13 ties and domestic violence accusations.His wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, has denied those claims, stating the restraining order cited by Leavitt was filed “out of caution” and later resolved through counselling. “This is about due process and the rule of law,” Van Hollen said after meeting Abrego Garcia on Thursday. “We won’t give up until Kilmar has his due process rights respected.”Senator Van Hollen’s visit to El Salvador was partly blocked by Salvadoran officials, who refused him access to the high-security CECOT prison where Abrego Garcia was reportedly held. El Salvador’s Vice President Félix Ulloa also rejected a request to release the detainee, saying his government has no plans to return him.Democrats argue the case illustrates the Trump administration’s disregard for legal norms, with Rep. Robert Garcia calling it “a constitutional crisis.” A Democratic delegation, including Sen. Cory Booker and Rep. Maxwell Frost, is planning a visit to El Salvador to assess Abrego Garcia’s status.Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers have praised the deportation. Reps. Riley Moore and Jason Smith visited the CECOT prison, supporting Trump’s crackdown on undocumented immigrants. The administration has also invoked past crimes by Salvadoran nationals in the US to justify its policy, including the 2023 murder of Rachel Morin.","Kilmar Abrego Garcia, 29, was deported on March 15 despite an active US immigration court order blocking his removal.

Judge orders Tufts student Rumeysa Ozturk detained in Louisiana must be returned by May 1,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/judge-orders-tufts-student-rumeysa-ozturk-detained-in-louisiana-must-be-returned-by-may-1/articleshow/120418549.cms,"Rumeysa Ozturk (AP Photo)

A Turkish student Rumeysa Ozturk from Tufts University , detained in a Louisiana immigration facility, must be transported back to New England by May 1 for a hearing to assess the legality of her detention following her co-authorship of an opinion piece in the student newspaper, as ordered by a federal judge on Friday.In Burlington, Vermont, U.S. District Judge William Sessions scheduled a bail hearing for May 9 and a merit hearing for May 22. Whilst Ozturk's legal team sought immediate release or transfer to Vermont, the justice department contended that jurisdiction belonged to a Louisiana immigration court.The judge stated in his ruling that the proceedings would continue with Ozturk physically present, acknowledging the seriousness of her habeas claims and committing to an expeditious review process.The case emerged after the 30-year-old doctoral candidate was apprehended by masked immigration officials on March 25 whilst walking in a Boston suburb. She was subsequently transported through New Hampshire and Vermont before being flown to Basile, Louisiana. On Wednesday, an immigration judge refused bond, citing concerns about danger and flight risk.Ozturk's situation reflects a broader pattern involving university-affiliated individuals whose U.S. visas were cancelled or entry denied following allegations of Palestinian support or protest participation. A similar case involves Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil, whom authorities seek to deport based on national security concerns.Initially, Ozturk's legal representatives filed in Massachusetts, hampered by uncertainty about her location and communication restrictions. Ozturk reported making several unsuccessful attempts to contact legal counsel.The controversy stems from an opinion piece Ozturk co-authored with three other students in ""The Tufts Daily"", criticising the university's handling of student activists' demands regarding Palestinian issues and Israeli-linked investments.Her legal team argues that the detention violates constitutional rights, including freedom of speech and due process. While Judge Sessions acknowledged the plausibility of these constitutional claims, he determined they were insufficient for immediate release.A Department of Homeland Security representative claimed last month that investigations revealed Ozturk's involvement with Hamas, a designated terrorist organisation, though no supporting evidence was provided.","Rumeysa Ozturk must be transported back to New England by May 1 for a hearing to assess the legality of her detention.

Fresh new allegation against Garcia



The X handle of the White House kicked up a storm over the Kilmar Abrego Garcia , the Maryland man referred to as the 'mistakenly deported Maryland man' but whom the Trump administration prefers to call a member of the notorious MS-13 gang. Amid controversy over the Donald Trump administration's unwillingness to bring him back from El Salvador, the White House X account Friday did the unimaginable.It picked an NYT report of Maryland senator Chris Van Hollen meeting Garcia in El Salvador, outside the prison, and proof-checked it. ""Senator meets with wrongly deported Maryland Man in El Salvador,"" the NYT headline said.The White House X handle 'fixed' it and made it to 'Senator neets with Deported MS-13 illegal alien in El Salvador who's never coming back'. ""Fixed it for you, @NYTimes. Oh, and by the way, @ChrisVanHollen -- he's NOT coming back,"" the White House handle said tagging the Maryland senator who waited outside the El Salvador prison to meet Garcia. Donald Trump mocked him and said he looked like a fool begging for attention for 'fake news media'.But the White House official handle's meddling in the issue, and that too targeting NYT, came across as a low-blow to many who wondered whether it was White House adviser Stephen Miller behind those worlds.""The official White House Twitter account is such an embarrassment. These folks get so much joy out of degrading the office itself. Zero semblance of decorum and statesmanship. A collection of unprofessional, gleeful ghouls,"" one wrote.""Nothing to see here - just the official White House Twitter account stating that it's going to blatantly defy the Supreme Court while openly defaming a man,"" another wrote.""The White House Twitter account is just the absolute dregs of the sh*tposting world. I don't see how what they share is ever appropriate from an official account,"" one user commented.""Who is the actual PERSON who's in charge of the White House Twitter account, do all these jackals take a turn?It seems like one VERY immature child who's running it, but that could be anyone in the Trump administration,"" one said.""Who's running the white house twitter page? Big Balls? Eric? It's absolutely disgusting,"" one wrote.New York Post reported on Fridat that the feds suspected Garcia was engaged in human and labor trafficking in 2022. Garcia was pulled over by the Tennessee Highway Patrol on Dec. 1, 2022, after he was caught speeding. Officers found eight other individuals in the car with Abrego Garcia, who said he was driving “three days ago” from Houston, Texas, to Temple Hills, Maryland, “to bring in people to perform construction work,” according to qa DHS memo.The officer suspected he stumbled upon “a human trafficking incident” after finding no luggage in the car.","Kilmar Abrego Garcia is a member of the notorious MS-13 gang.

While a doctor was being sworn in, a girl fainted in the audience creating a dramatic moment caught on the camera as President Donald Trump had to pause his speech as people rushed to attend to the girl. Dr Mehmet Oz was being sworn in as head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.Trump was in the middle of answering a question about whether he would permit Iran to maintain a civilian nuclear power program as it turned into an impromptu press conference.The program was stopped and all those who gathered at the Oval Office on the occasion of the swearing in were ushered out.The six-year-old girl who fainted was identified as a family member. A White House official said of the event: “A minor family member fainted during Dr Oz’s swearing in ceremony in the Oval Office. We are happy to say she is okay.”Oz — who ended his television career to mount an ultimtaely unsuccessful campaign for a Pennsylvania Senate seat in 2022 -- was already administered the oath by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.Trump said the former television host had “come to this position as one of the nation's most talented and beloved medical professionals."" He cited Oz’s Harvard undergraduate education, his medical degree from Pen and time as Director of the Cardiovascular Institute and integrative medicine program at New York Presbyterian Hospital and also as a professor at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons.“Boy oh boy, I thought he only did a show,” the president said as he was not aware of his illustrious career outside the television.“I only know the show. You know why I know the show? Because he said ‘I’m a little overweight, I should lose some weight.’""“I did his show, and that’s what I got out of it,” the president continued. “That was not good.”",Dr Mehmet Oz was being sworn in as head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

US judge blocks Trump admin's plans for mass layoffs at CFPB,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-judge-blocks-trump-admins-plans-for-mass-layoffs-at-cfpb/articleshow/120413536.cms,"A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from dismantling the consumer finance protection bureau on Friday. The judge also said that she is “deeply concerned” that the officials aren’t complying with her earlier order that maintains the bureau’s existence until she rules on the merits of a lawsuit seeking to preserve it.US district judge Amy Berman Jackson ruled that the authority can’t immediately proceed with the decision to mass fire hundreds of employees.During the courtroom hearing, Jackson made it clear that no mass firings or shutdown of employee access to CFPB computer systems would be allowed until further notice. “I’m willing to resolve it quickly, but I’m not going to let this RIF go forward until I have,” she said, referring to the proposed “reduction in force” strategy.The administration’s plan would see around 1,500 of the bureau’s employees dismissed, reducing its staff to just 200. A formal hearing has been scheduled for April 28, when key officials involved in the RIF process will be called to testify.The CFPB, established to protect consumers from financial abuse, has been a frequent target of criticism from conservatives and businesses.Republican Trump, during his second tenure, sought to reshape the federal government, calling it fraud, waste and abuse. Tesla owner and Trump’s ally Elon Musk has often made the bureau a top target of his Department of Government Efficiency.The lawsuit challenging the bureau’s shutdown is still pending, but for now, the agency remains intact — and so do the jobs of its workers.",US district judge Amy Berman Jackson ruled that the authority can’t immediately proceed with the decision to mass fire hundreds of employees.

US Visa News: 50% of students whose US visas have been revoked by Trump admin are Indians: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/50-of-us-students-whose-visas-have-been-revoked-by-trump-admin-are-indians-study/articleshow/120413612.cms,"Majority of the students who lost their visas in Trump crackdown are Indians, a study revealed.

The American Immigration Lawyers Association has revealed a study claiming that 50 per cent of the reported cases of US students whose visas got revoked are Indian. The association examined 327 reports of visa revocations by the Donald Trump administration and found out India leads the list followed by China with 14 per cent of Chinese students being at the receiving end of Trump's crackdown on visas.The study found out that a total of 50 per cent of visa revocations impacted those who were on Optional Practical Training (OPT), which means they had graduated and were employed in the United States.While the Trump administration has been reiterating that the visa crackdowns are not without any reason and most plausible reason is involvement in political unrest, the report claimed that of the total cases, only two students reported any history of engaging in political protests. “While 86% reported some level of interaction with the police, 33% had their case dismissed, were never charged, or were never prosecuted,” said the lawyers’ association. Two of the students who had reported interaction with the police are complainants in domestic violence cases. Some of the others had speeding tickets and parking-related violations.“Based on these reports, it is clear that transparency, oversight and accountability are needed to prevent further arbitrary visa revocations and SEVIS (Student and Exchange Visitor Information System) record terminations,” said the association. “Finally, there should be a way for students to appeal SEVIS terminations that are inaccurate without facing a gap in their employment or requiring the university to be involved, given the sheer number of those impacted.”The report stated that, according to a verified source, ICE has terminated 4,736 SEVIS records since January 20, 2025, the majority on F-1 status.Only 14 per cent of students reported receiving notice from ICE and they were all on OPT. They received mails informing them that their OPT had been terminated.

If it’s not, then we have other priorities to focus on,” Rubio told reporters.Although recent meetings in Paris involving US, Ukrainian and European officials were described as “constructive,” Rubio warned that the clock is ticking. He revealed that a new round of talks in London could be decisive, adding, “It’s not our war.”Meanwhile, the US and Ukraine have signed a memorandum of intent for a minerals deal that could lead to major infrastructure investment and cooperation, a key development tied to wider negotiations.","The US president said he was hopeful a ceasefire could be reached but made it clear that if either side proves too difficult, the US would simply “take a pass.” His comments came just hours after Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the administration was reassessing the viability of peace talks.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120413128,imgsize-911338,width-400,resizemode-4/AP-photo.jpg"
Ahmadiyya minority beaten to death by anti-blasphemy group in Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/ahmadiyya-minority-beaten-to-death-by-anti-blasphemy-group-in-pakistan/articleshow/120412129.cms,"A member of Pakistan’s Ahmadiyya community was beaten to death on Friday after a mob of radical surrounded an Ahmadi place of worship in Karachi’s Saddar neighbourhood.The crowd, having many from the anti blasphemy political groupTehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), forced their way through narrow streets chanting anti-Ahmadi slogans before surrounding the colonial-era worship site. Tensions quickly escalated when the group accused the minority community of violating Pakistan’s controversial anti-Ahmadi laws.“One member of the community was killed after the mob identified him as an Ahmadi,” said Muhammad Safdar, a senior police official in Karachi.“They attacked him with sticks and bricks.”Police said members of several religious parties were part of the mob. To protect others from further violence, officers took around 25 Ahmadis into custody and moved them away in a police-escorted van after negotiating with the crowd, which had swelled to around 600 people.The Ahmadiyya community, considered heretical by Pakistan’s state and many religious groups, has long faced systemic discrimination. Ahmadis, who have a population of almost 10 million worldwide, consider themselves Muslims and have faith identical to mainstream Islam in almost every manner. Though they regard themselves as Muslim, a 1974 constitutional amendment declared them non-Muslim, and a 1984 ordinance criminalised many of their religious practices.Friday’s killing is the latest in a long history of persecution. According to community records, six Ahmadis have been killed in 2024 so far, with over 280 killed since 1984. Thousands more have faced criminal charges, including hundreds under Pakistan’s harsh blasphemy laws.Abdul Qadir Ashrafi, a 52-year-old businessman who took part in the protest, said the group’s intention was to pressure police to act against the Ahmadis.“We requested that the place be sealed and that those conducting the Friday prayers be arrested, with criminal proceedings initiated against them,” he told AFP.The human rights commission of Pakistan condemned the attack, saying it was ""appalled by the orchestrated attack by a far-right religious party on a colonial-era Ahmadi place of worship.""“This failure of law and order is a stark reminder of the continued complicity of the state in the systematic persecution of a beleaguered community,” the commission posted on social media platform X.Mob violence has become an all-too-common response to accusations of blasphemy in Pakistan, often with deadly consequences. In a similar incident last year, dozens of churches were torched in the city of Jaranwala after a Christian man was falsely accused of blasphemy.","A member of Pakistan’s Ahmadiyya community was beaten to death on Friday after a mob of radical surrounded an Ahmadi place of worship in Karachi.

No, other factors are more important. Yes, it is essential.

Bangladesh on Thursday called on Pakistan to issue a formal apology for the genocide committed by its forces during the 1971 liberation war. It also asked the neighbouring nation to address several outstanding bilateral matters, aiming to build a more solid foundation for future relations, Prothom Alo reported.Pakistan, in turn, expressed its willingness to hold discussions for settling those issues.“Pakistan suggested continued discussion in future over these issues. The meeting that took place today was supposed to be a regular practice, but the last one was held in 2010,” Bangladesh foreign secretary Jasim Uddin said at the meeting.Uddin shared details of the day's diplomatic engagements, following a round of secretary-level talks held earlier that morning at the Padma state guest house.He led the Bangladeshi delegation, while Pakistan’s foreign secretary Amna Baloch headed her side. Following the talks, Baloch paid courtesy visits to chief adviser professor Muhammad Yunus and Foreign Affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain. She had arrived in Dhaka the previous afternoon.Last year, Yunus had called on Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to resolve the lingering issues stemming from the 1971 war ""once and for all,"" emphasizing that doing so would allow Dhaka to move forward in strengthening its ties with Islamabad.However, he had refrained from explicitly calling for a formal apology over the mass killings and rapes committed by its army during the war—a demand previously set by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina as a prerequisite for initiating the normalization of bilateral relations.","Bangladesh calls on Pakistan to issue a formal apology for the genocide committed by its forces during the 1971 liberation war.
