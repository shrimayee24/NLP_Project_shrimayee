He was on Thursday interrogated for nearly eight hours before being arrested. Though Pandey had initially denied any involvement in financial irregularities, he evaded answers when officers produced documentary evidence. An officer said Pandey, Ghosh's ""right-hand man"", got money from him.According to an officer, Pandey's role surfaced after his phone number was found on the call lists of multiple accused. He was also reportedly present at the hospital on Aug 9, when the PGT doctor's body was discovered. He had thereafter checked into a Salt Lake hotel with a woman friend.After his name surfaced in the case, Pandey went missing from his home at Golabari, Howrah. Though officers found his flat locked, his neighbours said he was seen there even after the incident.RG Kar Hospital insiders said his proximity to Ghosh had made Pandey so powerful that no action could be taken against him despite allegations, such as his involvement in ragging at RG Kar's Maniktala hostel last year and him holding parties at the hospital guest house, where Ghosh was seen.After Aug 9, junior doctors alleged 59 people had threatened them. An inquiry panel had summoned Pandey. In its reports to the RK Kar principal on Wednesday, the panel suggested strict action against 15, including Pandey.",Pandey was reportedly close to former RG Kar principal Sandip Ghosh and was allegedly involved in a number of scams at RG Kar.

"Mob loots arms, ammunition from Manipur police station",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mob-loots-arms-ammunition-from-manipur-police-station/articleshow/113920074.cms,"With one more death,

toll mounts to four

A mob took away around 21 firearms and 900 rounds of assorted ammunition from the armoury of Ukhrul police station in Manipur in a raid coinciding with Wednesday's gunfight 3km away involving two Naga villages, officials revealed Thursday as the death toll in the violence rose to four.While cops are still to report the number of weapons the mob snatched, sources said the loot included six INSAS rifles, three AK-47s, eight 9mm pistols, two 9mm carbines, an SLR and a Sten gun.The looting frenzy harked back to the peak of the ethnic conflict in the state last year, when mobs barged into several state armouries and took away hundreds of firearms.Army chief Gen Upendra Dwivedi said in New Delhi earlier this week that those episodes contributed to Manipur's society getting ""weaponised"" and feeding the flames of the conflict. Around 25% of the 4,000-odd weapons lost to looters have since been recovered, he said.The gunfight around which the latest instance of looting occurred was apparently over the choice of a disputed site for a Swachh Bharat Mission-linked programme. A member of Manipur Rifles was among the three casualties in the firing.Y R Pamreiyo, one of those critically wounded, died at Jawaharlal Nehru Institute of Medical Sciences in Imphal early Thursday. The first three victims were civilians Reileiwung Hongray and Silas Zingkhai, and Worrinmi Thumra of Manipur Rifles.The conflict involved villagers of Hunphun and Hungpung, both inhabited by the Naga community .Chief minister N Biren Singh said the administration was disbursing financial assistance to the families that lost a member each in the fighting. He sought support from organisations representing the community in fostering peace and preventing further violence.Internet and mobile data services remained suspended in Ukhrul town on Thursday, while indefinite curfew was in force in the ""neutral zone"" between Thingrasa and Ngapaha.",A mob took away around 21 firearms and 900 rounds of assorted ammunition from the armoury of Ukhrul police station in Manipur.

Tollywood's all-out against the minister's remark



KTR and Nagarjuna send legal notice to minister

NEW DELHI: Under fire from the Tollywood fraternity and slapped with multiple legal notices, Congress minister Konda Surekha on Thursday had to retract her controversial remarks over BRS leader KT Rama Rao 's involvement in actors Samantha and Naga Chaitanya 's divorce.""My comments are meant to question a leader's belittling of women and not to hurt your sentiments. The way you (Samantha) have grown up with self-power is not only an admiration for me, but also an ideal,"" the minister tweeted addressing the actor after a massive outrage.A host of stars such as Chiranjeevi, Nagarjuna, junior NTR, Venkatesh, Prakash Raj and Khushbu took strong exception to her remarks.Actress Samantha also took to social media and lashed out against the ""baseless"" allegations made by Konda Surekha. Meanwhile, veteran actor Nagarjuna and KT Rama Rao took the legal route and slapped the minister with legal notices on the remark they regard as ""baseless"".The controversy broke out after Telangana forest and environment minister Konda Surekha alleged BRS leader KTR's involvement in drug-related parties and claimed that he was responsible for Naga Chaitanya and Samantha Ruth Prabhu's divorce.In a public press meet, Konda Surekha insinuated that politician KT Rama Rao (KTR) made a deal with actor Nagarjuna, involving Samantha Ruth Prabhu, to prevent the demolition of the N-Convention Centre. She claimed that when Samantha refused to comply, it led to her separation from Naga Chaitanya. Surekha also alleged that Nagarjuna pressured Samantha, but she declined.“KTR is the reason why Naga Chaitanya and Samantha broke up in the first place. He has the habit of exploiting women and even heroines. He has gotten several heroines addicted to drugs. He even tapped their phones to get personal information. Doesn’t he have a mother, sister, and wife at home? Why doesn’t he respect and value women,” Konda Surekha said in the video that went viral on social media.Veteran actor Nagarjuna, who is also the father of Naga Chaitanya condemned Konda Surekha's remarks, labeling the accusations as false. He urged her to respect the privacy of individuals and avoid making baseless claims.""I strongly condemn the comments of Honourable Minister Mrs Konda Surekha. Don't use the lives of movie stars who stay away from politics to criticise your opponents. Please respect other people's privacy. As a woman in a responsible position, your comments and accusations against our family are completely irrelevant and false. I request you to withdraw your comments immediately,"" he wrote on X.Amala Akkineni expressed her displeasure over Konda Surekha's comments, calling the minister a ""demon"" and accusing her of ""preying on decent citizens as fuel for a political war."" She also appealed to Rahul Gandhi, the Leader of the Opposition to prevent their ministers from making such ""venomous statements."" Amala also tagged Priyanka Gandhi in her post, demanding an apology to her family.“Konda Surekha garu, dragging personal lives into politics is a new low. Public figures, especially those in responsible positions like you, must maintain dignity and respect for privacy. It’s disheartening to see baseless statements thrown around carelessly, especially about the film industry,” actor Jr NTR said.Meanwhile, Naga Chaitanya addressed the situation, stating that the decision to divorce his former partner, Samantha Ruth Prabhu, was a painful one. He dismissed Konda Surekha's allegations as ""false, ridiculous, and unacceptable.""Actor Nani said it was ""disgusting to see politicians thinking that they can get away with talking any kind of nonsense"".Former Union minister and actor Chiranjeevi said he was ""extremely pained to see the disgraceful remarks made by an honourable woman minister"".“It is a shame that celebs and members of the film fraternity become soft targets as they provide instant reach and attention. We, as the film industry, stand united in opposing such vicious verbal assaults on our members,” he said.“We choose our leaders to make society a better place to live in, and not contaminate it by lowering the discourse. Politicians and people in honourable positions should set better examples,” he said.Actress and BJP leader Khushbu Sundar also hit out at the remarks made by minister Konda Surekha. “I thought it was only those who need 2 minutes of fame and indulge in yellow journalism who speak this language. But here, I see an absolute disgrace to womanhood. Konda Surekha garu, I am sure some values were instilled in you. Where have they flown out of the window? A person in a responsible position cannot make such baseless, appalling, and degrading statements about my industry, my place of worship,” she said.Meanwhile, BRS leader KTR and Nagarjuna Akkineni filed complaints against Telangana environment minister Konda Surekha's ""defamatory (and) derogatory"" remarks.In the legal notice, KTR's counsel stated that he had been subjected to ""scandalous attacks"" as a result of Surekha's ""vitriolic campaign,"" with the intent to harm his reputation.","Congress minister Konda Surekha had to retract her controversial remarks over BRS leader KT Rama Rao's involvement in actors Samantha and Naga Chaitanya's divorce.

He was a non-veg eater, and he was not against cow slaughter. He was modern in a way,"" Rao, a Brahmin himself, said, further stating that Savarkar's ""fundamentalist ideology"" stood in contrast to Indian culture.Rao also criticised Pakistan's founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah, calling him ""a hardcore Islamist believer"" but distinguished between Jinnah and Savarkar.""Jinnah was not a fundamentalist like Savarkar. He used to drink wine and, it is said, ate pork as well, but he became a Muslim icon after the two-nation theory and politics.

""Congress wants to divide Hindu society into different castes in order to win elections. This was also the British policy of 'divide and rule',"" he said, adding that he would file a defamation suit against Rao.BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi said Congress should know that Savarkar was the only freedom fighter in India's history who was sentenced to two life imprisonments but the opposition party, which was used to insulting sanatan tradition, had not done it for the first time.BJP MP Anurag Thakur accused Rahul Gandhi of promoting a ""tukde tukde"" ideology, saying the Congress MP was a ""modern Jinnah"". ""India will not tolerate the disrespect of Veer Savarkar, who dedicated his life to the country,"" he said.Shiv Sena's Sanjay Nirupam too criticised Congress for repeatedly maligning Savarkar, who is revered in Maharashtra.In response to the backlash, Rao issued a clarification on Thursday, saying his comments were based on statements made by Savarkar himself.""Savarkar, on many occasions, had stated that he was an atheist and ate meat. I did not say anything new,"" Rao said in a statement.He clarified that his remarks were not personal attacks on Savarkar but were meant to draw a comparison between the lifestyles of Mahatma Gandhi and Savarkar.""I mentioned Savarkar being non-vegetarian while comparing the lifestyles of Gandhiji, who strongly believed in the Hindu religion yet remained democratic, and Savarkar, who had an ambition of building a Hindu nation despite being an atheist.

It was later found crashed over Himachal's Rohtang Pass On Tuesday, when two Army officials came to Malkhan's old house in Fatehpur village in UP's Saharanpur district, informing the family about the recovery of his mortal remains - his wife died waiting for him for 32 years - there was silence at first.And then joy. And tears. It was overwhelming for everyone. The family was told to make arrangements for the last rites.He was too young for us to believe he was indeed dead. His wife spent her life thinking he was alive somewhere and would return one day. She had a newly born son when he went missing. She died sometime around 2000, carrying a lifelong hope and wait,” said Malkhan’s youngest brother, Isham Pal, now 65.“If the body had been found even 25 years ago, his wife would have rested in peace,” added cousin Vishwas Singh. The family said that ever since Malkhan disappeared, they never heard anything about him.“We lost all hope after running pillar to post searching for him,” Vishwas said. “When he couldn’t be traced for years, there was a ‘family adjustment’. Malkhan’s wife was married off to his brother Chandrapal Singh. Malkhan’s only son, Ram Prasad, had two sons, Gautam Kumar (22) and Manish Singh (16), and three daughters. Ram Prasad died in 2010. Malkhan’s parents, wife and only son passed away desperately waiting for closure.”Malkhan’s grandchildren, who grew up listening to stories about him, took part in his last journey on Wednesday as hundreds, perhaps more, joined in. “We are full of emotions,” said Gautam.

A 21-year-old Yazidi woman kidnapped by Islamic State militants in Iraq was freed from Gaza this week in a clandestine operation involving Isarel, the United States and Iraq, said the officials.The woman identified as Fawzia Sido was kidnapped a decade ago when she was 11-years-old and was reunited with her family in northern Iraq after a four-month long operation, Silwan Sinjaree, chief of staff of Iraq's foreign minister, told Reuters.Yazidi religious community is mostly found in Iraq and Syria which witnessed more than 5,000 members killed and thousands more kidnapped in an IS campaign in 2014 that the UN has termed genocide.Iraqi officials have been in contact with her for months and passed on her information to US officials, who managed her exit from Gaza with assistance of Israel, as per source. Notably, Iraq and Israel do not have any diplomatic ties.In order to free Sido, the Israeli military said it had coordinated with the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem and ""other international actors.Sido escaped to a hideout inside Gaza strip after her captor was killed during Gaza war, presumably by Israeli strike, as per statement.She continued on to Jordan through the Allenby Bridge Crossing and from there returned to her family in Iraq, as per military.A young Yezidi woman who was kidnapped and trafficked to Gaza has been safely evacuated and reunited with her family in Iraq, according to a State Department spokesperson.The woman was taken from her home in Iraq when she was 11 years old and was later sold and trafficked to Gaza. Her captor was recently killed, which allowed her to escape and seek repatriation.A State Department spokesperson stated, ""The United States on Tuesday helped to safely evacuate from Gaza a young Yezidi woman to be reunited with her family in Iraq.""A U.S. defense official confirmed that the American military did not participate in the evacuation.Sinjaree said that the woman was recovering after being held captive by Islamic State militants. She is in good health, her time in captivity and the harsh conditions in Gaza have left her deeply traumatized, saidIraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani played a key role in her release. His adviser for Yazidi affairs, Khalaf Sinjar, confirmed that al-Sudani discussed the matter with U.S. officials at the U.N. General Assembly in New York last month.In 2014, more than 6,000 Yazidis, including Sinjaree, were captured by Islamic State fighters in the Sinjar region of Iraq. Many were subjected to sexual slavery or forced to become child soldiers and were taken to places such as Turkey and Syria.To date, over 3,500 Yazidis have been rescued or freed, according to Iraqi authorities. However, around 2,600 remain missing.

Former First Lady of the US Melania Trump has once again addressed her debatable “I really don’t care, do u?” jacket in her coming memoir , revealing it was meant as a “discreet yet impactful” message to the media, not related to her visit to a migrant detention centre, according to the New York Post.Melania, wife of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump , wore the Zara jacket in 2018 during a trip to the US-Mexico border , sparking outrage and widespread speculation about its intended meaning.Many assumed the message was tied to the plight of migrant children.However, in an excerpt from her memoir reported by ' The Guardian ', Melania insists the jacket was aimed at the media, claiming, ""It’s a message for the media... to let them know I was unconcerned with their opinions of me.” According to her, she was advised by her then-press secretary, Stephanie Grisham , to avoid publicly explaining this intent. “I disagreed with her insistence that I couldn’t say that,” Melania wrote, adding that Grisham instead told a CNN reporter the jacket was merely a “fashion choice with no underlying message.”Melania claims the media’s focus on the $39 jacket overshadowed the pressing issues of the time, such as the welfare of children at the border and a significant policy change. She called the media’s reaction “irresponsible behaviour.”Grisham, who resigned in 2021 and has since become a vocal critic of the Trumps. She alleged the idea to wear the jacket came from Donald Trump himself, who said: “You just tell them you were talking to the f–king press.”","Melania wore the Zara jacket in 2018 during a trip to the US-Mexico border.

At least 50 killed as boat capsizes in eastern Congo lake,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/at-least-50-killed-as-boat-capsizes-in-eastern-congo-lake/articleshow/113912317.cms,"Boat capsizes in eastern Congo lake (Picture credit: X)

A boat carrying around 100 passengers capsized on Lake Kivu in eastern Congo on Thursday, resulting in at least 50 deaths, according to an AP report citing witnesses.The overloaded boat, traveling from Minova in South Kivu province to Goma in North Kivu province, sank while attempting to dock near the port of Kituku. Rescue services recovered at least 50 bodies, but the exact number of people on board remains unclear.Ten survivors were taken to Kyeshero hospital.Local authorities said rescue operations are still ongoing.South Kivu province governor Jean-Jacques Purusi informed a local radio station, “This boat was carrying about a hundred people when it had the capacity for about thirty passengers.”Bienfait Sematumba, who lost four family members, said, “They are all dead. I am alone now. If the authorities had ended the war, this shipwreck would never have happened.”A witness at Kituku port , Francine Munyi, said, “I was at the port of Kituku when I saw the boat arriving from Minova, full of passengers. It started to lose its balance and sank into the lake. Some people threw themselves into the water.”One survivor, Neema Chimanga, described the incident: “We saw the boat start to fill with water halfway. The door of the boat opened, and we tried to close it. But the water was already coming in, and the boat tilted.” She added, “I threw myself into the water and started swimming. I don’t know how I got out.”Residents and victims' families gathered at the port, blaming authorities for negligence amidst growing regional insecurity. Many residents turned to maritime transport due to the closure of the road between Goma and Minova, caused by ongoing conflict. A shipping agent, Elia Asumani, commented, “We are afraid. This shipwreck was predictable.”This incident follows a similar accident in February when a boat carrying 50 passengers capsized on Lake Kivu. In June, 80 people died when an overloaded boat sank near Kinshasa. Earlier this year, 22 people died on Lake Maï-Ndombe, and in April, six were killed, with 64 missing, on Lake Kivu.","A boat carrying around 100 passengers capsized on Lake Kivu in eastern Congo on Thursday, resulting in at least 50 deaths, according to an AP report citing witnesses.

I wish I could take credit for it,” Vance said. “But it’s because I guess the timer is right by the camera.”Despite it being unintentional, Vance took the attention in stride and appreciated the amusement his glances brought, saying, “It spawned a million viral memes .

'Worst is yet to come’: Living ‘Nostradamus’ warned of Middle East conflict—and it’s happening,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/worst-is-yet-to-come-living-nostradamus-warned-of-middle-east-conflictand-its-happening/articleshow/113922238.cms,"Brazilian psychic Athos Salomé , often referred to as the "" living Nostradamus "" had warned that the tensions will escalate in the Middle East this year. Salomé claims his earlier prophecies of deadly conflict between Israel and Iran are beginning to unfold, with even darker days ahead.The Daily Star reported that he foresaw a future where geopolitical strife escalates beyond regional borders, threatening to destabilize the world.Salomé had garnered attention for his uncanny foresight, which includes predictions of major global events like the death of Queen Elizabeth II, the Covid-19 pandemic, and Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter.Salomé’s prediction for a violent clash between Israel and Iran became real earlier this year. It started with an Israeli airstrike on April 1, 2024, that targeted the Iranian embassy in Syria. Less than two weeks later, on April 13, Iran retaliated by launching a massive offensive of drones and missiles at Israel. The Brazilian psychic believed this exchange is only the beginning of a far more destructive conflict.The conflict escalated significantly as Iran launched some 200 missiles on Israel earlier this week, with most of them -- but not all -- intercepted by Israeli air defences with help from allies.“The situation in Israel is currently tense and intricate, characterized by a cycle of violence deeply rooted in historical, political, and religious issues,” Salomé had said, reflecting on the fragile peace in the region.While his initial vision centered on disputes over oil resources, particularly involving the now-deceased Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, his more recent insights offered a far broader scope.""The worst is yet to come, as the great leaders, adherents of occultism, use these practices to achieve surgical precision and choose the exact moment for their attacks and major events."" The Daily Star quoted Salomé saying.According to the Daily Mail, Salomé had also suggested that modern conflicts in the Middle East may heavily rely on artificial intelligence (AI). “AI could either serve as a peacekeeping tool or exacerbate conflicts, depending on how it’s deployed,” he said.According to the psychic, both Israel and Iran may increasingly use AI to shape their military strategies, adding an unsettling dimension to the already complex hostilities.Salomé also points to a growing threat of electromagnetic pulse (EMP) strikes—a form of warfare that could cripple electronic infrastructure and lead to widespread chaos. He believes that superpowers like the United States, Russia, China, and even North Korea are edging towards the use of EMP technology.Salomé’s prophecy includes a scenario he calls the ""three days of darkness,"" a period in which EMP attacks would bring down power grids, plunging societies across the globe into turmoil. Should this vision come true, nations may find themselves grappling with the collapse of essential systems.","Athos Salomé, often referred to as the "" living Nostradamus,"" had warned that the tensions will escalate in the Middle East this year.

This surge, he argues, is part of a larger strategy that poses a “true threat to democracy,” similar to the concerns often raised by former President Donald Trump.The billionaire entrepreneur's comments come at a time when immigration is a hot-button issue, particularly for the Republican Party, which has consistently criticised Vice President Kamala Harris for her handling of the border crisis. Trump's campaign has repeatedly targeted Harris, claiming she has overseen record numbers of undocumented migrants crossing the US border in recent years.Harris has proposed reviving bipartisan border agreements that Republicans dismantled earlier this year, yet her administration's approach continues to face backlash from conservatives who argue that more decisive action is needed.","Space X founder accuses Democratic Party of 'voter importation scam' to win swing states.

Like Epstein list, a list of names, all celebrities, with links to P Diddy and his Freak off sessions, are doing the rounds on social media. The alleged list contains names of Leonardo Dicaprio , Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Ashton Kutcher, Paris Hilton, Howard Stern, Russell Brand, Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez, Russell Simmons, Usher, Meghan Fox. The list goes viral as Usher, Pink deleted their X posts and theories that Justin Bieber might have been a victim of Diddy float around.Nobody has been implicated in the Sean Combs case so far.P Diddy is facing serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering where he forced women to have sex with male prostitutes that continued for days as the entire action was caught on camera. Huge stocks of baby oil, drugs were found at Diddy's sex den while Diddy did not plead guilty to the charges.Usher who once stayed with Diddy said his X account got hacked and that's why all his past posts disappeared. This happened as his old statement in which said he witnessed wild things when he stayed with Diddy resurfaced.Apart from Usher and Pink, Megan Fox deleted all her posts on Instagram and X triggering speculations over how she was linked to Diddy.An old snipped of Khloe Kardashian claiming that she attended one of Diddy's naked parties emerged.

Well this party...I think half the people there were butt naked,"" this is exactly what Khloe said about Diddy's party.Diddy was Justin Bieber's mentor but Bieber's spokesperson said he is trying not to focus on the charges and accusation of Diddy.

Doctor pleads guilty in 'Friends' star Matthew Perry's death due to drug overdose,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/doctor-pleads-guilty-in-friends-star-matthew-perrys-death-due-to-drug-overdose-ketamine-queen-depression/articleshow/113889172.cms,"San Diego doctor Mark Chavez became the third person to plead guilty in the investigation surrounding Matthew Perry ’s tragic death. Dr Chavez, 54, on Wednesday took the first step in cooperation with federal prosecutors , agreeing to a plea deal that could prove pivotal in targeting larger figures believed to be responsible for Perry’s demise.The “Friends” star, who played Chandler Bing, was found dead in October 2023 from a drug overdose that has now sparked a wide-reaching investigation into the illegal distribution of ketamine .The case exposed the chilling reality of how an off-label treatment for depression spiraled into a lethal cocktail. Perry, who had battled addiction for years, sought refuge in ketamine therapy—a controversial, yet increasingly common treatment for depression. However, as his dependency grew, so did his desperation. When his legal sources dried up, Perry turned to the dark underbelly of the medical world, allegedly aided by Dr Salvador Plasencia and notorious Los Angeles dealer Jasveen Sangha, known as the “ketamine queen.”Dr Chavez, standing before US District Judge Sherilyn Peace Garnett, admitted his role in this dangerous network. His admission came as prosecutors recounted how he conspired with Plasencia to distribute ketamine to Perry through fraudulent prescriptions.Chavez, who once took an oath to do no harm, found himself supplying over 22 vials and nine lozenges of the powerful anesthetic. It was this very drug that Perry's assistant would find beside the actor’s lifeless body that fateful October day.“Are you pleading guilty because you did the things the prosecutors described?” Judge Garnett asked Chavez.“Yes, your honor,” he replied.The plea agreement Chavez signed in July binds him to cooperate fully as federal prosecutors continue to build their case against Plasencia, the doctor who allegedly delivered the fatal doses, and Sangha, the woman whose reputation as a drug supplier looms large in Los Angeles. Their roles, prosecutors argue, were far more sinister, as they preyed on Perry's vulnerability in his final months. US Attorney Martin Estrada, during a press conference in August, pointed to their exploitation of Perry’s history of addiction, providing him with “amounts they knew were dangerous.”Plasencia and Sangha are the ultimate targets. Text messages between Plasencia and Chavez, revealed in court filings, shed light on the extent of their illicit operations. In one exchange, Plasencia mused about how much Perry might pay for the drugs, calling the actor a “moron” and suggesting that they make themselves his go-to suppliers. Chavez, while hesitant at first, seemed to approve—so long as they stayed away from “shady stuff"".Chavez remains free on bond until his April 2 sentencing, having surrendered his passport and medical license as part of the agreement.Outside the courtroom, Chavez’s lawyer, Matthew Binninger, spoke briefly, signaling that his client had come to terms with his role in the tragic chain of events. “Mark entered his plea of guilty and that’s now public record,” Binninger said. “You accept responsibility and then you set sentencing,” he said.","San Diego doctor Mark Chavez is the third person to plead guilty in the investigation surrounding Matthew Perry's tragic death.

The weapons McCaul referred to, 2,000-pound bombs capable of devastating entire fortified areas, remain ready to be shipped but have yet to receive clearance.The delay, which has now stretched over four months, stems from concerns raised earlier this year regarding civilian casualties in densely populated Gaza. These bombs, designed to rip through thick concrete and metal, could wreak havoc in urban areas. Human rights advocates have been vocal in urging restraint, cautioning against the use of such heavy weaponry in regions where civilians could bear the brunt of the impact.However, McCaul is not alone in his calls. Many Republicans have urged the Biden administration to rethink its stance on halting the bomb shipments, arguing that Israel’s safety and its strategic position in the region should come first.“Allow these weapons, which are ready to ship, to be sent to Israel immediately,” McCaul said. His appeal comes amid fears of an expanding conflict, with Hezbollah’s involvement and Iran’s missile barrage raising the specter of a wider regional war.For months, Israel has been locked in an escalating battle with Hamas in Gaza, but more recently, its focus has shifted northward as Israeli forces target Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon. Hezbollah, backed by Iran, has been a longstanding adversary of Israel. The fragile truce seems to be on the brink of collapse, with Iran launching over 180 ballistic missiles at Israel earlier this week. The Israeli government has sworn a forceful retaliation.The Biden administration, for its part, has remained silent on McCaul’s letter so far. But with the escalating situation in the Middle East and increasing pressure from Republicans in Congress, the White House may soon have to make a difficult choice.","Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, has called on President Joe Biden to expedite a stalled transfer of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel. The delay, which has now stretched over four months, stems from concerns raised earlier this year regarding civilian casualties in densely populated Gaza.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113921769,imgsize-659545,width-400,resizemode-4/113921769.jpg"
"Blackface: GOP Congressman faces backlash over 2006 blackface photos, claims it was 'homage to Michael Jackson'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/gop-congressman-faces-backlash-over-2006-blackface-photos-claims-it-was-homage-to-michael-jackson/articleshow/113919234.cms,"Republican representative Mike Lawler (Photo: AP)

New York Congressman and Republican figure Mike Lawler is facing backlash after photographs surfaced showing him dressed in blackface at a Halloween party nearly two decades ago. The images, obtained by The New York Times , depict a 20-year-old Lawler, who is white, dressed as Michael Jackson with his face visibly darkened. The incident occurred in October 2006.Lawler, now 38, did not deny the authenticity of the images.In a statement, he showed regret but insisted that his costume was a tribute to his ""musical hero,"" Michael Jackson, rather than an intentional act of racism. “The ugly practice of blackface was the furthest thing from my mind,” he said. “Let me be clear, this is not that. It was truly the sincerest form of flattery, a genuine homage.”The congressman has often spoken about his admiration for Jackson, even recounting how he attended the pop star's 2005 trial for child molestation charges. However, the newly revealed photos are the first known instance of him darkening his skin to resemble the Black musician, a practice widely regarded as racist.The timing of the controversy could prove damaging for Lawler, who is gearing up for a tough re-election battle in a swing district. His opponent, Mondaire Jones, a Black former congressman, may seize upon the images in a race that is expected to draw national attention.The blackface photos were reportedly shared on Facebook in 2006 and later circulated among Lawler’s classmates at Manhattan College, now known as Manhattan University. Witnesses familiar with the incident told The New York Times that Lawler had borrowed bronzer from female classmates to complete the costume. One photo shows him wearing a red jacket reminiscent of Jackson's iconic ""Thriller"" video and striking a signature dance pose.Although Lawler has apologised to anyone who took offence, he maintained that his intentions were misunderstood. “I am a student of history, and for anyone who takes offence to the photo, I am sorry,” he said. “All you can do is live and learn.”Historians note that while Lawler’s costume appears to be a tribute rather than a deliberate attempt to mock or denigrate Black Americans, it remains problematic. “There’s always an entitlement — a racist privilege — behind the blackface mask,” said Dr Eric Lott, a cultural historian at the City University of New York.Dr Elizabeth Stordeur Pryor, a historian at Smith College and the daughter of comedian Richard Pryor, shared similar sentiments. “There’s a danger to it even when it might be a homage,” she said, warning that such acts cannot be dismissed as harmless, even if not intended to offend.Mike Lawler gained national prominence in 2022 after defeating a powerful Democrat in a left-leaning district.","Mike Lawler, 38, dressed as Michael Jackson at a Halloween party in 2006.

According to authorities, Abraham died from blunt force trauma in what they are treating as a homicide.An arrest warrant obtained by 'PEOPLE' revealed that Thomas was taken into custody a day later in Texas after allegedly being found driving Abraham’s car.

False claims about celebrities

Music executives who worked closely with Diddy are terrified that their names will come out and they are losing their sleep over this, lawyer Bryan Freedman said assuring that those who have not done anything wrong should not be unnecessarily concerned. Diddy has been charged for sex-trafficking, racketeering, and providing transport for prostitution -- and he pleaded not guilty to any of the charges.Celebrities are deleting any connection with him as it is believed that the buck won't stop with Diddy -- many high profile names will come out.“Many people at the highest level, including artists, executives, managers and others are not sleeping well right now,” Bryan Freedman told Page Six.“Those who have knowingly allowed and/or encouraged the behavior while remaining silent should be concerned.“I represent a number of people who have been concerned about being wrongfully mentioned or rumored to be a part of this just by an association unrelated to any wrongdoing … they don’t want to part of some rumor mill because they have some tangential connection to Combs.”Many Hollywood A listers partied with Diddy but that does not mean they were complicit in the trafficking that Diddy did. The celebrities, a report said, used to leave by the time the parties used to get wilder and many with whom Diddy's photos are going viral may not have anything to do with the charges.Universal Music Group CEO Sir Lucian Grainge protested the ""offensively false"" claims that they ""aided and abetted"" Combs.“Everyone knows someone who was at a party with Diddy. There must be 5,000 people who could have seen anything remotely bad that they worry they should have reported,” one Hollywood legal source told PageSix.Attorney Tony Buzbee who recently announced that 120 people have come forward with allegations against Diddy said there are high-profile names which will shock people but they are not releasing any list of names immediately as they are double-checking everything.","Music executives who worked closely with Diddy are terrified that their names will come out.

The individual who gained access was affiliated with Mike Lindell , the CEO of My Pillow and a prominent advocate for the discredited claim that Trump lost due to ballot fraud.Throughout the proceedings, Peters falsely alleged that Dominion Voting Systems, which managed Mesa County’s election infrastructure, was complicit in a scheme against Trump.","Tina Peters, the former clerk of Mesa County, Colorado, was sentenced to nine years in prison on Thursday.

UNITED NATIONS: Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif on Friday accused India of “massive expansion of its military capabilities” and issuing threats to cross the LoC for taking over Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir, as he raised the Kashmir issue again in his UNGA address. He demanded that New Delhi reverse the 2019 abrogation of Article 370.Pakistan routinely raises the Kashmir issue at the annual UN debate.India is expected to exercise its right of reply to counter Sharif’s allegations.Sharif said “like the people of Palestine”, the people of Jammu and Kashmir have “struggled for a century for their freedom and right to self-determination”.He said the escalation of Islamophobia was a troubling global development. “The most alarming manifestation of Islamophobia is the Hindu supremacist agenda in India. It aggressively seeks the subjugation of 200 million Muslims and the obliteration of India's Islamic heritage,” he claimed.“Even more worryingly,” he said, India “is engaged in massive expansion of its military capabilities which are essentially deployed against Pakistan”. Its war doctrines envisage a surprise attack and a limited war under the nuclear overhang, he said, adding that India had spurned his country’s proposal for a mutual strategic restraint regime, and its leadership has “often threatened to cross the Line of Control” and take over what Pakistan refers to as “Azad Kashmir”.",Pakistan routinely raises the Kashmir issue at the annual UN debate.
