When I didn’t fear sitting on a hunger strike at minus 40 degrees at Khardung La Pass, why should I fear jail. It will only strengthen the Ladakhi agitation,” he said.Leh Apex Body and Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA) organised the march in protest against the alleged delay in resuming the dialogue process by the Centre to discuss the demands of the Ladakh people. KDA functionaries warned of serious consequences if any of their members and Wangchuk were arrested. It was the first such protest march since Gupta entered LG office on July 18.On Jan 2, 2023, Union home ministry set up a high-powered committee to address key issues in Ladakh. The last round of talks, held on May 27, led to the introduction of a domicile policy for Ladakh with a 15-year eligibility period starting from 2019.Since the abrogation of Article 370 on Aug 5, 2019, and the bifurcation of the erstwhile state of J&K into two UTs, Ladakh has seen many political agitations seeking statehood for Ladakh and inclusion in Sixth Schedule.",Climate activist Sonam Wangchuk and Ladakh MP Mohmad Haneefa Jan among many people took part in a protest rally at the end three-day hunger strike in Kargil Monday.

‘Imported rotten meat’ sparks outrage in Kashmir,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/imported-rotten-meat-sparks-outrage-in-kashmir/articleshow/123247461.cms,"SRINAGAR: J&K is in the grip of a food safety scare after officials seized more than 11,600kg of “imported rotten meat” from warehouses, eateries and shops across Kashmir valley, triggering a storm of halal concerns and rumours.The seizures, excluding poultry, were made over the past week during surprise inspections that uncovered illegal storage and gross violations of safety rules. Images of decayed meat on social media spurred calls to boycott animal meat in restaurants.Religious leaders joined the outcry, questioning how such supplies had gone unchecked for years and whether they were even permissible under Islamic law.Kashmir’s grand mufti Nasir-ul-Islam urged people to avoid animal meat dishes such as tikka, kebab, biryani and momo in eateries until the matter is resolved. “The rumour mills have it that the meat could be that of stray dogs,” he said.Kashmir’s chief priest Mirwaiz Umar Farooq condemned the alleged supply of unsafe food as “a betrayal of public trust”, warning it could involve carrion — strictly forbidden in Islam.CM Omar Abdullah convened a meeting Monday to review the enforcement drive, urging residents to report concerns to authorities and avoid taking the law into their own hands.“The grave problem appears to have remained unchecked and unnoticed for too long. The unscrupulous elements have played with the health and lives of people. This has to stop,” he said.Food safety commissioner Smita Sethi said the seized meat has been destroyed. In one case, inspectors found an unregistered cold storage unit in Srinagar’s Zukura area allegedly hoarding imported meat without power backup. “We didn’t find much in other areas because people had already dumped it in rivers,” she said.Sethi said frozen meat imports into J&K are legal, but the seized consignments lacked expiry and packaging dates, import source details and proper labelling. Many storage sites allegedly failed to maintain the mandatory –18°C temperature. Using inspections, smell checks and mobile labs, authorities confirmed much of it was “unfit and rotten”.No FIR has been filed yet, but Sethi said investigations will lead to inquiries against those involved.CM Abdullah ordered “exemplary punitive action” under the Food Safety and Standards Act, including criminal proceedings for serious violators.“No meat should be sold and used without proper clearance,” he said, while directing that entry-point check posts and testing labs be set up at Lakhanpur and Qazigund, and district-level food testing facilities established beyond Srinagar and Jammu.","Officials seize more than 11,600kg of “imported rotten meat’ from warehouses, eateries and shops across Kashmir valley.

NEW DELHI: Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Monday wrote to Union home minister Amit Shah seeking clarity on the whereabouts and health of former Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar, who resigned unexpectedly on July 21 citing health reasons.In his letter, Raut expressed concern that there has been “no information” about Dhankhar since his resignation and urged the home minister to “provide genuine information” on his safety.Raut recalled that on the morning of July 21, Dhankhar “appeared normal” while presiding over the Rajya Sabha’s Monsoon session and even engaged in a verbal exchange with Leader of the Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge before adjourning proceedings.However, by 6pm the same day, his resignation was announced, a move Raut described as “shocking.” He wrote: “From July 21 till today, there has been no information about the whereabouts of our Vice President. What is his current location? How is his health? There is no clarity on these matters.”The Shiv Sena leader said attempts by Rajya Sabha members to contact Dhankhar had failed, and rumours were circulating in Delhi that the former vice president had been “confined to his residence” and “reportedly not safe.”He warned that some MPs were considering a habeas corpus petition in the Supreme Court, but he had decided first to approach Shah: “Before knocking on the doors of the Supreme Court I thought it to be prudent to seek this information from you. ”Raut’s intervention follows similar calls from Independent MP Kapil Sibal, who questioned the silence around Dhankhar’s whereabouts. Sibal said he had “never heard of a ‘laapataa [missing] vice president’,” and noted that even Dhankhar’s family and close associates had offered no update. “The home ministry must know where Dhankhar is and must reveal it,” he said, warning that such secrecy “should not happen in a democracy. ”Dhankhar, 74, resigned midterm as vice president, just two years after assuming office in August 2022.

Five Al Jazeera journalists, including well-known correspondent Anas al-Sharif, were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a journalists’ tent in Gaza City on Sunday. The Israeli military confirmed it carried out the strike, accusing al-Sharif of being a Hamas operative who “posed as a journalist” and led a terrorist cell responsible for rocket attacks.Al Jazeera condemned the killings as a “targeted assassination” aimed at silencing independent reporting from Gaza, where international media access remains heavily restricted. The strike marks one of the deadliest incidents for the network since the war began nearly two years ago, during which over 200 media workers have been killed, according to press freedom groups.Al Jazeera confirmed that five of its staff died in the attack: correspondent Anas al-Sharif, fellow reporter Mohammed Qreiqeh, and camera operators Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal, and Moamen Aliwa.Also read: Journalist or Terrorist? Who was Anas al-Sharif? Al Jazeera reporter killed in Israeli strike The group had been sheltering in a tent opposite Al-Shifa Medical Complex, a site long used by media crews. Al-Sharif, 28, was one of the most recognisable Arabic-language reporters covering the conflict, known for his frontline reports from northern Gaza. Hours before his death, he posted footage on X showing nearby Israeli strikes. The killings have deepened concerns about journalist safety in Gaza, where local reporters provide most coverage due to the ban on foreign press entering without Israeli military escort.In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) described Anas al-Sharif as a “Hamas terrorist” who used journalism as cover. They claimed intelligence from Gaza — including rosters, training records, and salary documents — proved his affiliation. According to the IDF, al-Sharif led a Hamas cell responsible for organising rocket attacks on Israeli civilians and troops. “A press badge isn’t a shield for terrorism,” the statement read. The military also accused Al Jazeera of integrating Hamas operatives into its reporting teams. Israel has long accused the Qatar-based network of bias, while Al Jazeera says such claims are politically motivated attempts to justify attacks on its journalists.Al Jazeera condemned the attack as a “blatant and premeditated assault” on press freedom. The network accused Israel of deliberately targeting its journalists following repeated incitement by Israeli officials. It said the slain reporters were among the last to remain in Gaza, providing live, unfiltered accounts of the humanitarian crisis. The broadcaster warned that the killings were part of a wider campaign to “silence the truth” about the war. Calling for urgent international action, Al Jazeera argued that immunity for perpetrators fuels further attacks and urged governments to pressure Israel to halt the targeting of media workers.The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said it was “appalled” by the deaths, warning that Israel’s practice of branding reporters as militants without public evidence raises “serious questions about its respect for press freedom.” CPJ Regional Director Sara Qudah stressed that journalists are civilians and must never be targeted. Reporters Without Borders (RSF) noted that over 200 journalists have been killed in Gaza since the war began, making it one of the deadliest conflicts for media in recent decades. Both organisations called for an independent investigation into the strike and for the protection of reporters working in conflict zones.Israel and Al Jazeera have had a strained relationship for years. The Israeli government has banned the broadcaster from operating inside the country, accused it of incitement, and raided its offices. The latest war in Gaza has heightened tensions, with Al Jazeera frequently challenging Israeli narratives about military operations. Qatar, which funds the network, also hosts the political leadership of Hamas and has mediated indirect talks between Israel and the group. Critics say this fuels Israeli mistrust of the channel, while supporters argue it remains one of the few outlets providing on-the-ground coverage from Gaza.With Gaza sealed off from most international journalists, global news organisations rely heavily on local reporters like al-Sharif for coverage. These journalists face extreme danger, lacking the protection afforded to embedded foreign correspondents. Many live under constant bombardment, while also coping with shortages of food, water, and medical care. The deaths of prominent figures such as al-Sharif further diminish the flow of independent reporting from the enclave. UN agencies and rights groups have warned that the loss of these voices leaves the world reliant on official statements and severely limits scrutiny of military actions.Before the strike, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed foreign media, defending Israel’s expanded military operations in Gaza. He insisted Israel must “finish the job” by dismantling Hamas strongholds, not only in Gaza City but also in the central refugee camps and Muwasi. Netanyahu promised “safe zones” for civilians, though similar areas have been bombed in the past. He also announced plans to bring more foreign journalists into Gaza under military supervision. Critics, including the UN, warned that the expansion risks worsening the humanitarian disaster in the territory, which is already facing severe food shortages and mass displacement.The UN Security Council held an emergency meeting after Netanyahu’s announcement, but no concrete action was agreed. The United States defended Israel’s right to act against Hamas, rejecting allegations of genocide. China condemned the “collective punishment” of Gaza’s population, while Russia warned against a “reckless intensification” of hostilities. UN humanitarian official Ramesh Rajasingham said starvation was already occurring, with conditions “beyond horrific. ” Rights groups argue that targeting journalists undermines transparency and accountability in such a crisis, making independent reporting all the more crucial.Gaza’s health ministry reports more than 61,000 Palestinians killed since the war began, with roughly half being women and children. The conflict has displaced the majority of Gaza’s population and driven parts of the territory into famine. The ministry says at least 100 children and 117 adults have died from malnutrition-related causes since June. Aid delivery remains chaotic, with incidents of gunfire reported near distribution sites. Israel denies pursuing a policy of starvation, blaming shortages on Hamas. Humanitarian agencies say access restrictions and ongoing fighting are preventing sufficient relief efforts.Palestinian officials, press freedom advocates, and humanitarian organisations have called for the killings of al-Sharif and his colleagues to be investigated as war crimes. They argue the strike fits a broader pattern of silencing journalists who document alleged abuses. Al Jazeera says its slain reporters embodied the “courage and resilience” of Gaza’s press, working despite personal risk to expose the war’s impact. As the conflict nears its second year, the network warns that without independent witnesses, the humanitarian crisis will unfold largely unseen — and those responsible will face even less scrutiny.","Anas al-Sharif, Mohammed Qreiqeh, Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal, and Moamen Aliwa were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a journalists’ tent in Gaza City on Sunday.

A young suitor followed. The scrub and dust of Ranthambore's Zone 6 bore witness Saturday evening to a spectacle even veteran trackers blinked at - the national park's oldest living tigress T-39, aka Noor, mating at an age when most big cats have long hung up their claws.Estimated to be 17 to 18 years old, Noor already holds the Ranthambore record for breeding at the oldest age ever seen in the wild. In 2022, she produced a litter - her ninth - defying the norm that tigresses stop breeding by 12 or 13. In May 2023, conservation biologist Dharmendra Khandal saw her litter weak and emaciated, her udder dried up.Yet here she was - glowing coat, canines intact - mating with T-101, with reports she had also paired with another male days earlier. ""Mating at this age has not been observed in the wild,"" former honorary wildlife warden Balendu Singh said. ""She is healthy. At present, she is the oldest living tigress in the wild without intervention.""Noor's longevity and reproductive fire point to formidable genetics. She is the daughter of Old Sultanpur female T-13 - known as Binda. ""Her mother reached 18.5 years without support until she disappeared in Oct 2023,"" Khandal said.""But the maximum breeding age I've personally observed in the wild is that of Noor in Ranthambore.""The mating may never bear fruit. ""Not a cat in hell's chance,"" said a veterinary officer, adding there's no documented case of a tigress birthing at or after 17 even in captivity.But in the wild, as Khandal put it, there's always ""a rare push against nature's limits"".Sometimes it's male pressure, sometimes it's her choice.

Meet ‘Hercules’, Asia’s Largest Tiger Caught on Camera in Uttarakhand | 7 Feet, 300 Kgs

N EW DELHI: Two Bengal tiger cubs have died at the Delhi zoo in the past three days, officials said on Monday, just a week after the birth of six cubs, the largest litter in two decades.The cubs were born to a seven-year-old tigress, Aditi, on August 4. This was her first litter since arriving from the Gorewada rescue centre in Nagpur.The smallest cub in the litter died inside the enclosure on the morning of August 8. Another, too weak to feed, was moved to the zoo hospital on August 9, but died the following night despite treatment.Zoo director Sanjeet Kumar said Aditi is feeding and caring for the remaining four cubs, who are under 24-hour CCTV and manual monitoring.“Supplements are being given to the mother to support milk production. The remaining cubs are active and feeding well,” Kumar said as quoted by PTI.Before this litter, the zoo had six white tigers and seven Royal Bengal tigers. In 2023, tigress Siddhi from Gorewada gave birth to five cubs, the first Royal Bengal tiger birth at the zoo in nearly 18 years, but only two survived. The last litter of six was in 2005, when two survived. The most recent white tiger birth was in 2022, when tigress Sita delivered three cubs, of which two survived. Officials say survival rates in large litters are often low.The Delhi Zoo, which has housed tigers since its opening in 1959, is recognised under the Central Zoo Authority’s conservation breeding programme as a centre for tiger conservation and breeding.","Two Bengal tiger cubs have died at the Delhi zoo in the past three days.

Uttarakhand flash floods: Temporary lake formed in Harsil poses new risk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/temporary-lake-formed-in-harsil-poses-new-risk/articleshow/123246171.cms,"DEHRADUN: A temporary lake, nearly 400-500m long, has formed in the upper reaches of Harsil following the Aug 5 Dharali flash flood, raising concerns over a potential breach that could endanger downstream areas. With IMD warning of more rain in the coming days, officials said a sudden rupture could send a surge of water downstream, worsening the destruction already caused by the flood.Efforts are now focused on controlled drainage to protect lives, and a 10-member team of geologists from various departments has been sent to Uttarkashi to assess the lake's stability and recommend safe discharge measures. On Monday, SDRF personnel used an electric saw to cut through a large tree obstructing the water's flow in an attempt to create an outlet. Garhwal commissioner Vinay Shankar Pandey confirmed that work had begun to drain the lake which formed on the Bhagirathi in Harsil.IG SDRF Arun Mohan Joshi said the disaster-hit area has been divided into sectors for coordinated management. ""A Lt Col from the Army is overseeing operations at the temporary lake in Harsil, with all necessary support being provided to ensure safe and smooth water discharge,"" he added.During a review meeting on Aug 8, NDMA member secretary Rajendra Singh had instructed state officials to maintain constant surveillance of the lake and deploy a joint Army-state team to inspect and oversee safe water release.Border Roads Organisation said the lake has submerged around 600m of the road from Harsil to Dharali near the Army camp. ""We cannot assess the road damage until the water is drained. Repairs can only start after that,"" a senior BRO officer told TOI, adding that ongoing monsoon rains are worsening the risk and slowing restoration work.

Benin’s citizenship program seeks to heal history and strengthen ties with the Black diaspora

From memorial tourism to a personal journey of heritage

Grammy-winning singer Ciara has made history as one of the first high-profile individuals to receive citizenship from Benin through a groundbreaking initiative aimed at reconnecting descendants of enslaved Africans with their ancestral homeland. The ceremony took place on July 26 in Cotonou, marking a symbolic moment for both the artist and the West African nation.Justice Minister Yvon Détchénou described the program as a step toward repairing deep historical wounds. “By legally recognizing these children of Africa, Benin is healing a historical wound. It is an act of justice, but also one of belonging and hope,” he said during the event.In September, Benin passed a law granting citizenship to people over 18 who can prove their lineage to victims of the transatlantic slave trade from sub-Saharan Africa, provided they do not already hold citizenship from another African nation. Applicants can submit DNA results, authenticated testimonies, or historical family records.To streamline the process, the government launched a digital platform, My Afro Origins, allowing descendants worldwide to apply. While other African nations have opened similar pathways, Benin’s efforts carry profound weight due to its significant role in the slave trade. An estimated 1.5 million people were taken from the Bight of Benin region—modern-day Benin, Togo, and parts of Nigeria—by European traders, often with the involvement of local kingdoms.Benin has openly acknowledged its part in the slave trade, hosting conferences since the 1990s and issuing formal apologies. Today, the country invests heavily in “memorial tourism,” with historical sites like the Slave Route and the haunting Door of No Return in Ouidah serving as powerful reminders of the past.After receiving her citizenship, Ciara walked these historic paths, reflecting on their significance. “Between emotion, reflection and heritage, I experienced a profound return to what truly matters,” she shared.Also Read: “Rhyme with betrayal”: Blake Lively fears friendship fallout with Taylor Swift could go public as Travis Kelce gets dragged into the drama Best known for hits like “Goodies” and “Level Up”, Ciara’s journey is more than a personal milestone—it’s a symbol of reconnection between Africa and its diaspora, inspiring others to explore their roots while acknowledging the complex history that shaped them.","Grammy-winning singer Ciara has made history as one of the first high-profile individuals to receive citizenship from Benin.

Donald Trump then surprised several by claiming the penalty was too severe on Late Night with David Letterman. Trump also accused the young woman, claiming she was ""dancing at his door at one o'clock in the morning."" These phrases enraged people since they looked to absolve Tyson's crime.Years later, in August 2025, an X (previously Twitter) user reposted Trump's previous remarks. Having been very vocal against Trump for years, Martina Navratilova saw this and reacted strongly.She wrote on X that Trump has always made excuses for rapists like Tyson.

American medical schools teach that gender is a social construct, that sex is not determined at birth, that drugs can fix everything.Worse, admissions to these schools are based on affirmative action and not merit. Hardworking white and Asian Americans are disadvantaged in admissions,"" Dhillon said.""Perhaps we can address the problems with American medical education and the artificial supply limitations without scapegoating the foreign-born doctors who provide a critically necessary service throughout the country.

""The H1B system is broken and needs reform. What does that have to do with medical education? Nothing, and it’s lazy to conflate the two broken systems,"" Dhillon said.""I’m in favor of doubling our domestic med school capacity. It will take decades to do this.

Gisele Bündchen’s perspective on fair expectations in marriage

Life after Tom Brady — from power couple to co-parents



Rumors, resilience, and moving forward



Years before her 2022 split from NFL legend Tom Brady, Gisele Bündchen had already made peace with one of the biggest truths about love and marriage — no single partner can fulfill every role in someone’s life. Her 2018 memoir Lessons: My Path to a Meaningful Life reveals a philosophy that still resonates today.In her book, the Brazilian supermodel wrote, “I think we can put too much pressure and responsibility on our marriages and partnerships. We expect our partners to be our lovers, our best friends, our advisers, our everything… But why should one partner be responsible for the sum total of the other person’s experience? It’s unfair and limiting to both.”These words challenged the fairytale notion of a relationship where one person must “be everything” to the other. Gisele emphasized that life is made up of many relationships, each offering different lessons, and that expecting total fulfillment from one partner is unrealistic and unhealthy.When Bündchen and Brady announced their divorce in October 2022 after 13 years of marriage, the split was described as amicable.While some NFL fans accused Gisele of pressuring Brady to retire, her memoir suggests otherwise — she had long accepted that marriage works best when each partner has the space to grow individually.The two have remained committed co-parents to their children, Benjamin and Vivian Lake. In fact, Gisele purchased a home in Miami directly across from Brady’s residence to ensure an easier transition for the kids. This move reflects her belief in maintaining a strong family unit, even without the romantic partnership.Post-divorce, Bündchen’s personal life has been the subject of constant speculation, from whispers about her martial arts instructor Joaquim Valente to links with friends of Brady. But, just as she wrote in her memoir, she appears unfazed by public opinion, focusing instead on her children, career, and personal growth.Also Read: Did Gisele Bündchen’s anti-Donald Trump stance push Tom Brady to snub his White House visit? Gisele’s pre-divorce words now serve as a reminder that healthy love does not mean dependency — a message that feels even more relevant in the wake of one of the most high-profile celebrity breakups in recent memory.","Gisele Bündchen and Tom Brady announced their divorce in October 2022 after 13 years of marriage.

DHARALI (UTTARKASHI): To say it’s difficult to reach Dharali after the floods ravaged it on Aug 5 would be a great understatement. A TOI team crossed rivers, scampered up slippery boulders, trudged through forests and trekked for 26 hours before reaching the village in Uttarakhand’s Uttarkashi that until a few days ago was a busy stop for pilgrims heading to Gangotri but is now a deserted mass of stones, mud and sediment.The pain of seeing Dharali as it stands today doesn’t end there. At every step one is reminded that there are people buried beneath the soil. No one knows how many.Dharali is these days marked by a quiet that hangs heavy over the uneven landscape, broken only by the clank of metal on stone and the hum of search teams. With heavy rain forecast in the coming days, rescue teams —already forced to work by hand where the ground refuses to hold machinery — fear delays and renewed danger.Rescuers and villagers move slowly across the moonscape of debris, eyes scanning for the faintest signs of life, arms sifting through rubble for valuables — a box of jewellery, a family photograph, a tool that might still be of use — anything the angry waters did not claim. Each find is set aside with care, logged and passed to villagers waiting at the Siddhveshar temple, now serving as arelief centre.The air carries the faint smoke of cooking fires, mixing with the damp scent of the debris outside.Conversations are brief, often breaking off mid-sentence as people glance towards the road, scanning for familiar faces that have not returned.Villagers who once gathered here for prayers and welcomed travellers, feeding them and providing them stay, wait for food packets. Rajat Panwar, clutching an empty cloth bag, told: “We don’t know why God punished us so. Our homes, orchards, and people were gone in a matter of seconds. We have nothing to live for now.”On a small temple’s stone porch, another man, Rakesh, sat on a slab of chipped concrete, wearing the same clothes from the morning of Aug 5. He has lost his shop, house, and hotel; his cousin, married only last year, was among those taken by the torrent. “Nothing is left,” he said, simply. Beside him, Pradeep Panwar recalled that on the morning of the disaster, there was a sudden roar. “Those who managed to run were saved; those who couldn’t…” His clothing shop and hotel had stood near the riverbank. Both have vanished.Teams from National Disaster Response Force , State Disaster Response Force, Army and police rotate through shifts — some cutting into gargantuan piles of rubble, others following the cues of sniffer dogs. Where the ground buckles underfoot, the work is done crouching low, hands digging into loose soil. Officials fear unseen channels of water from Kheer Gad are still running beneath the debris, turning the ground into a trap.","Dharali is these days marked by a quiet that hangs heavy over the uneven landscape.

MUMBAI: Maahi Rude always dreamed of becoming a doctor—a figure etched in her conscience as she underwent five major surgeries before turning 10 for her malformed spinal cord. The 20year-old Thanekar had been born with spina bifida, a neurological birth defect.In the face of rules, she almost gave up on her dream. But encouraged by one of her treating doctors, she moved Bombay HC four months ago to be allowed to take NEET, the MBBS entrance exam.“My disability certificate states I have 90% disability while NEET only allows those with up to 70% disability to apply,” she said. The court passed an interim order allowing her to appear for NEET 2025, in May. She didn’t do well as she had little time to prepare, she said, adding she will take it again.Her petition focused on the fact that Rude, who uses a wheelchair, is independent. While she cannot move her limbs from the waist down, ""her torso, arms, and other body parts above the waist remain unaffected by her disability.""A third-year student of dietetics, she travels alone from Thane to her college in Ghatkopar.""I am an ambassador of the Spina Bifida Foundation India, and I presented my own research paper at an international conference in Malaysia in 2024,"" said Rude, who is a trained Hindustani classical singer and founded the Elixir Band, a music band comprising people with spina bifida.She gave up on MBBS after trying to apply for NEET after Class 12. ""But, a few months ago, I used a stethoscope during a skit and put that picture as the display pic on my mobile,"" she said.Paediatric surgeon Dr Santosh Karmarkar, who operated on her ten years ago, saw the picture and called her. ""That is when I realised that Rude still wanted to be a doctor. So I decided to consult lawyer Mihir Desai,"" said Dr Karmakar, who is also the founder of the Spina Bifida Foundation. ""We take up cases of human rights violation, hence decided to take up Rude's case,"" said Desai.In May, she appeared for NEET but didn't do too well as she didn't have time to prepare. ""I will appear for NEET again,"" she said.Her petition-which comes up for hearing on Aug 12 (Tuesday)-has incidentally sought more than just permission for NEET 2025. ""It also seeks directions to ensure the authorities don't hinder her admission to a medical course solely due to her disability percentage,"" said her lawyer Pritha Paul.More importantly, the petition draws the court's attention to the guidelines included in the Graduate Medical Education Regulations in May 2019 for the admission of students with ""specified disabilities"".""We want these guidelines to be set aside and quashed to the extent that it declares persons with locomotor disability with a disability percentage of more than 80% not eligible for medical courses,"" said Paul.As for Rude, she plans to complete her graduation and simultaneously prepare for NEET. ""I want to be a doctor.""","Maahi Rude, 20, was born with spina bifida, a neurological birth defect. She underwent five major surgeries before turning 10 for her malformed spinal cord.

Pakistan prepares for SCO Summit amidst security concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-prepares-for-sco-summit-amidst-security-concerns/articleshow/114180796.cms,"Representative image.

Pakistan is gearing up to secure its capital, Islamabad, ahead of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit. The event, taking place on Tuesday and Wednesday, will see the attendance of key regional leaders, including India's foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, Russia's Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and China's Premier Li Qiang.In preparation for the summit, Pakistan's government has implemented strict measures. These include strict enforcement against movements protesting ethnic nationalism and new laws that limit demonstrations in the capital. Authorities have also detained hundreds of supporters of opposition leader Imran Khan , who is currently jailed, following their attempt to march in Islamabad.Security concerns have been heightened by a recent attack on a convoy of Chinese engineers in Karachi, raising fears for the safety of foreign nationals amid ongoing separatist violence. The government has responded by authorizing troop deployments in the capital throughout the summit's duration.Imtiaz Gul, a security analyst, emphasized the importance of the summit for Pakistan, stating, ""The government claims to have made elaborate security arrangements and understandably so because it has to make sure that the event passes off peacefully without any untoward incident.""The SCO, which includes China, India, Russia, Pakistan, Iran, and six other member states, is viewed by some as an alternative to Western alliances such as NATO. The agenda for the Islamabad summit focuses on trade, humanitarian, and cultural issues, though domestic issues in Pakistan may loom large.The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, led by Imran Khan, has threatened protests during the summit. Ahsan Iqbal Chaudhary, Pakistan's minister for planning, accused the PTI of trying to disrupt the event, stating, ""The PTI doesn't want to showcase the positive side of Pakistan to the world. Instead, they aim to present a picture of the country filled with tear gas and unrest.""To facilitate the summit, Islamabad and the neighboring city of Rawalpindi will observe a public holiday starting Monday, accompanied by road closures to reduce movement. The government quarter hosting the summit has been fortified and prepared for the visiting dignitaries.Pakistan, heavily reliant on Chinese investment for infrastructure projects, is keen to ensure the safety of its citizens and foreign guests, especially considering the broader uptick in militancy linked to the Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan.The authorities aim for a peaceful summit to enhance the country's image amidst various internal and external challenges.","Pakistan is hosting a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit.

Catholic leaders in Michigan, including all seven diocesan bishops, have expressed strong disapproval of governor Gretchen Whitmer 's recent viral video, which has been widely viewed as ridiculing the Christian sacrament of Holy Communion , as reported by Fox News.The clip, shared on feminist author Liz Plank ’s Instagram page, features Whitmer wearing a Harris-Walz hat and placing a Doritos chip into Plank’s mouth while she kneels on the floor. ""It is not just distasteful or ‘strange;’ it is an all-too-familiar example of an elected official mocking religious persons and their practices,"" said Paul A Long, president and CEO of the Michigan Catholic Conference (MCC), in a statement representing the views of the state’s Catholic leaders.The video was intended to promote US vice president Kamala Harris ’ policies ahead of the presidential election , emerging from Whitmer’s appearance on Plank’s "" Chip Chat "" podcast published on YouTube. Plank’s caption read, ""If he won’t, Gretchen Whitmer will. Chips aren’t just delicious, the CHIPS Act is a game-changer for US tech and manufacturing, boosting domestic production of semiconductors to reduce reliance on foreign suppliers! Donald Trump would put that at risk.""In their statement, the Catholic conference expressed ""profound disappointment and offense"" regarding Whitmer's actions. They noted that the skit features Whitmer mimicking the gesture of administering Communion, saying, ""The governor then stares expressionless into the camera.""Conservatives on social media have also accused Whitmer and Plank of mocking the Christian sacrament. Former Trump advisor Tim Murtaugh commented, ""Let’s be clear what’s happening in this video. gov.

Like Epstein's list, a list of names, all celebrities, with links to P Diddy and his Freak sessions, are doing the rounds on social media.The alleged list contains names of Leonardo Dicaprio , Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Ashton Kutcher, Paris Hilton, Howard Stern, Russell Brand, Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez, Russell Simmons, Usher, Meghan Fox. The list goes viral as Usher, Pink deleted their X posts and theories that Justin Bieber might have been a victim of Diddy float around. Nobody has been implicated in the Sean Combs case so far.P Diddy is facing serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering where he forced women to have sex with male prostitutes that continued for days as the entire action was caught on camera. Huge stocks of baby oil, drugs were found at Diddy's sex den while Diddy did not plead guilty to the charges.The hip-hop mogul, who maintains his innocence, has been denied bail twice since his September arrest.Usher who once stayed with Diddy said his X account got hacked and that's why all his past posts disappeared. This happened as his old statement in which said he witnessed wild things when he stayed with Diddy resurfaced.Apart from Usher and Pink, Megan Fox deleted all her posts on Instagram and X triggering speculations over how she was linked to Diddy.An old snipped of Khloe Kardashian claiming that she attended one of Diddy's naked parties emerged. ""I got on a plane at 5:30 am. Well this party...I think half the people there were butt naked,"" this is exactly what Khloe said about Diddy's party.Diddy was Justin Bieber's mentor but Bieber's spokesperson said he is trying not to focus on the charges and accusation of Diddy. Justin is in a happy bubble since he became a father.As the list of the Hollywood A-listers becomes long, they are maintaining absolute silence over Diddy's arrest.An officer involved in the raid on Diddy's home likened him to Jeffrey Epstein, alleging that he moved in the same social circles as Epstein and Harvey Weinstein. The officer mentioned that wild parties had been ongoing for 15 years, noting that while not all attendees were directly involved in trafficking, many witnessed inappropriate conduct. He stressed that a lot of people were aware of what transpired, particularly as the events became more explicit late at night.Also read on the Diddy case:","No Hollywood A-lister has been implicated in the Sean Diddy trafficking case but several 'Diddy lists' are viral.

Ohio Senator and Donald Trump's running mate, JD Vance has revealed he feels bad about bringing his wife, Usha Vance , to church every week, saying that ""she didn't sign up for this."" Vance said that Usha was raised in a Hindu household, has not converted to Catholicism despite attending Mass regularly.In an interview with the, Vance, admitted to feeling uncomfortable about how his religious journey has affected his wife. “I feel — felt — kind of bad,” he explained. “Like, ‘Oh, you didn’t sign up to marry a weekly churchgoer, and are you OK with this?’ And she was sort of more than OK with it, and that was a big part of the confirmation that this was the right thing for me.”Vance revealed that Usha encouraged him to explore Catholicism even though she did not follow the faith herself. “She thought that they were good for me, in a sort of good-for-your-soul kind of way,” he said. “I don’t think I would have ever done it without her support, because I felt kind of bad about it, right?”Reflecting on his spiritual growth, Vance shared his deeper motivations. “When I started to think about the big things, like, what do I actually care about in my life? I really want to be a good husband. I really want to be a good father. I really want to be a good member of the community. I wanted to be a virtuous human being, in other words.”Despite Usha's support, Vance acknowledged the pressures she faces. “I feel terrible for my wife because we go to church almost every Sunday, unless we’re on the road,” he said. He explained that although he helps with their children, Usha tends to feel the burden of keeping them quiet during the service. “Obviously, I help with the kids, but because I’m kind of the one going to church, she feels more responsibility to keep the kids quiet in the church.”Usha and JD Vance met at Yale Law School and married in Kentucky in 2014, with a Hindu priest presiding over a separate ceremony. They have three children. Usha has been pivotal in JD’s political career, helping him shape his thoughts on rural America’s social decline, which inspired his best-selling memoir, Hillbilly Elegy.

'Not giving you any if ... ': Trump at Coachella threatens to withhold wildfire aid from California,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/not-giving-you-any-if-trump-at-coachella-threatens-to-withhold-wildfire-aid-from-california/articleshow/114183838.cms,"Donald Trump has warned California Governor Gavin Newsom that the state could lose vital federal funding for wildfire relief unless action is taken to address ongoing water shortages and a controversial environmental policy. Speaking at a rally in Coachella, the former president criticised the state’s water management, claiming that policies intended to protect the endangered delta smelt fish were hurting farmers and leading to widespread drought conditions.Trump described California’s water crisis in stark terms, suggesting that vast swathes of land had become ""barren"" due to the rerouting of water into the Pacific Ocean to protect the fish. ""Millions and millions of gallons of water... gets pumped right into the Pacific Ocean,"" Trump said, lamenting the waste of water while farmers suffered from drought. He argued that, if elected, he would demand that Newsom reverse these policies, or risk losing federal assistance for the state’s frequent wildfires.Trump’s comments were delivered during a high-profile campaign stop in Coachella, a city in southern California, which he used as a platform to further criticise California’s Democratic leadership. He also made a thinly veiled threat to Newsom, saying, ""We’re not going to give you any of that fire money that we send you all the time for all the forest fires that you have"" unless changes were made.The former president's remarks targeted what he described as a ""mismanagement"" of California’s resources, blaming both state and federal policies for exacerbating the water shortage. Trump suggested that instead of prioritising the fish, the water should be used to support the state’s agricultural industry, which he described as the ""finest land in the country."" He claimed that millions of acres of farmland had been ruined due to the water rerouting and called for an overhaul of water policy.With key battlegrounds like Wisconsin and Pennsylvania at stake, Donald Trump spent Saturday night aiming to link Vice President Kamala Harris to her home state's challenges. Though he’s unlikely to win California, Trump used his Coachella visit to criticize the state’s issues, including homelessness, water shortages, and high costs. Referring to California as ""Paradise Lost,"" he warned, ""We won’t let Kamala Harris do to America what she did to California.""Despite the rhetoric, Trump’s visit to California is also a fundraising opportunity. Attendees paid up to $25,000 for a photo opportunity with the former president.In 2020, the former president lost California by a wide margin, but still received over 6 million votes—more than any previous GOP candidate. His support was strongest in rural counties, where he won by margins exceeding 70%, areas that traditionally lean conservative.","Donald Trump warned California Governor Gavin Newsom that the state could lose federal funding for wildfire relief unless action is taken to address water shortages and a controversial environmental policy.

'Pure racist identity politics': Barack Obama faces backlash for ‘lecturing’ Black men over lack of support for Kamala Harris,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pure-racist-identity-politics-barack-obama-faces-backlash-for-lecturing-black-men-over-lack-of-support-for-kamala-harris/articleshow/114180995.cms,"Former President Barack Obama is facing intense criticism after his October 10 remarks at a ""Black Voters for Harris"" event in Pittsburgh, where he expressed frustration with Black men supporting Donald Trump instead of Kamala Harris . Conservative commentator Benny Johnson led the charge, calling Obama’s comments “pure racist identity politics.” Johnson accused Obama of abandoning his previous message of unity, stating, “The magic is gone. This is the same guy who said, ‘There is not a white or Black America—there is only the United States of America!’ Now he’s running on racial supremacy? It’s grotesque.”Johnson's remarks were echoed by other conservative figures, including activist CJ Pearson, who took to social media to reaffirm his support for Trump. Pearson tweeted, “In 25 days, I’ll be joining millions of other young Black men and voting for Donald J. Trump! We don’t care what Barack Obama has to say about it.”Democratic Ohio state senator and former Bernie Sanders campaign advisor Nina Turner also criticized Obama, expressing her disappointment in his decision to single out Black men. Speaking on CNN, Turner said, “Why are Black men being lectured to? Why are Black men being belittled?” While she acknowledged her “love” for Obama, she emphasized that many Black men have valid reasons for voting differently, and those choices should be respected, even if others disagree. Turner urged Democrats not to lay the blame for lower support for Harris solely on Black men, stressing the importance of appealing to all voters and addressing their concerns.Obama's comments have sparked widespread debate, with many Black voters doubling down on their support for Trump. The controversy has also fueled further attacks from Trump himself, who mocked Obama and Harris on Truth Social. Trump claimed that Obama ""lacked enthusiasm"" for Harris and suggested the former president might even vote for him, stating, “Obama can’t stand Low IQ Kamala Harris, so he’ll be voting for President Trump in 2024!”As the 2024 election approaches, this backlash reflects broader concerns within the Democratic Party about energizing voters, particularly among Black men, a crucial demographic that could influence the election outcome.","Obama's comments have sparked widespread debate, with many Black voters doubling down on their support for Trump.

"Vance insists Trump had no role in January 6 attack, calls Capitol rioters 'knuckleheads'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/vance-insists-trump-had-no-role-in-january-6-attack-calls-capitol-rioters-knuckleheads/articleshow/114180198.cms,"Donald Trump 's running mate, JD Vance, said on Sunday that while a riot occurred on January 6 following Trump's defeat in the 2020 presidential election, there was still a ""peaceful"" transfer of power. Speaking at a rally, Vance claimed that the former president had no role in the violence, and he referred to those involved in the attack as ""a few knuckleheads"" who did ""something they shouldn’t do.""“Yes, there was a riot at the Capitol on January 6, but there was still a peaceful transfer of power in this country, and that is always going to happen. Donald Trump’s committed to it. The fact that a few knuckleheads went off and did something they shouldn’t do, that’s not on Trump, that’s on them,” Vance said.The January 6 insurrection saw supporters of then-president Donald Trump storm the US Capitol, attempting to prevent Congress from certifying Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election. The event led to multiple deaths and widespread damage, but ultimately the certification proceeded.In previous interviews, Vance has dodged direct questions regarding whether he believes Trump lost the 2020 election, instead shifting the conversation to issues like censorship and border control. During one interview, when asked multiple times about Trump's loss, Vance remarked, “There’s an obsession with 2020, I’m much more concerned about what happened after 2020.”“There’s an obsession here with focusing on 2020. I’m much more worried about what happened after 2020, which is a wide-open border, groceries that are unaffordable,” Vance said.","Donald Trump's running mate, JD Vance, said on Sunday that while a riot occurred on January 6, there was still a ""peaceful"" transfer of power.
