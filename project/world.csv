NEW DELHI: Fresh satellite images released on Thursday revealed the scale of destruction caused after Indian Army carried out precision strikes at 9 terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, under 'Operation Sindoor'.The comparative satellite images, released by Maxar Technologies, showed substantial structural damage across critical locations, specifically targeting the Jamia Mosque in Bahawalpur and within Muridke city in Pakistan.The complex, spread across 82 acres, was the 'alma mater' and the most important training centre of LeT located in Nangal Sahdan, Muridke, Sheikhupura, Punjab, Pakistan.Similarly, Jamia Mosque in Bahawalpur indicates evident destruction, with imagery analysis between pre-strike conditions and subsequent post-strike visuals.Markaz Subhan Allah was located at NH-5 (Karachi-Torkham Highway) on the outskirts of Bahawalpur at Karachi Mor in Bahawalpur district of Pakistan's Punjab province. This was the main centre of Jaish-e-Mohammed for training and indoctrination of youth which is spread over a 15-acre area.The Indian Army conducted targeted strikes, eliminating nine terrorist bases belonging to Jaish-e-Mohammed, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and Hizbul Mujahideen during 'Operation Sindoor' across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir.The Indian Air Force executed precise attacks on four sites within Pakistan's borders, whilst five locations were targeted in Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir. The Centre affirmed that the operation was ""focused, measured and non-escalatory"" and deliberately steered clear of Pakistani military installations.The tri-services 'Operation Sindoor', conducted jointly by the Army, Navy, and the Air Force, was carried out from Indian soil. The Defence Ministry said Operation Sindoor was “focused, measured and non-escalatory” and avoided any Pakistani military facilities.The government said that it exercised its right to neutralise terrorists and their infrastructure following the Phalgam terror attack in Jammu in Kashmir which claimed 26 lives.During the press briefing, foreign secretary Vikram Misri said Pahalgam terrorist attack has exposed the links of Pakistan with terrorists.""As you all know, on April 22, Pakistani and Pakistan-trained terrorist, associated with Lashkar-e-Taiba, launched a barbaric attack on tourists in Pahalgam. 25 Indians, and one Nepali citizen were cowardly murdered. This is the most serious incident since 2008 Mumbai attack considering that fact the civilians were attacked,"" Misri said.","Fresh satellite images released on Thursday revealed the scale of destruction caused after Indian Army carried out precision strikes at 9 terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

NEW DELHI: With a retaliation by Pakistan being considered likely, India has shored up its defences across the land, air and sea domains. The multi-layered air defence network is fully activated, several frontline warships are deployed in the Arabian Sea, and infantry units along the frontier are fully stocked and prepared to deal with any contingency.Amid combat air patrols being flown by IAF fighter jets, even the tri-Service Strategic Forces Command, which handles the country's nuclear arsenal, has been put on a high alert as a measure of abundant precaution.""India has demonstrated considerable restraint in its response. However, it must be said that Indian armed forces are fully prepared to respond to Pakistani misadventures, if any, that will escalate the situation,"" warned Wing Commander Vyomika Singh, a helicopter pilot, at the briefing by foreign secretary Vikram Misri.The feeling in military-diplomatic circles here, however, is that Pakistan Army chief General Asim Munir, who just a few days ago warned that any Indian ""military misadventure"" would be met with a ""swift and notched-up response"", has no option but to militarily respond to rally everyone around him in his beleaguered country. ""There will be great pressure on him to authorise some kind of a response,"" a senior officer said.Pakistan had managed to surprise India with its ' Operation Swift Retort ' a day after the IAF conducted the Balakot pre-dawn air strikes on Feb 26, 2019, in response to the Pulwama terror attack in which 40 CRPF jawans were killed earlier that month.""Lessons have been learnt. It will not be so easy this time. The armed forces have been preparing for the last 15 days and will not let their guard down,"" another officer said, while acknowledging that a large country like India simply cannot make its airspace totally impregnable.The armed forces, on their part, have inducted several new weapon systems since Balakot in 2019. The Russian-origin S-400 surface-to-air missile systems, which can detect and destroy hostile strategic bombers, fighters, missiles and drones at a range of 380-km, for instance, are now part of the IAF's integrated air command and control system (IACCS).At the other end of the spectrum, there are the older Igla-1M air defence systems and the newer shoulder-fired Igla-S missiles with an interception range of up to 6km.In between, there are the Israeli-origin Barak-8 medium range surface-to-air missile systems (70-km range), the indigenous Akash air defence missile systems (25-km) and the Israeli low-level Spyder quick-reaction anti-aircraft missiles (15-km).Many of these systems are plugged into the fully-automated IACCS network that combines a wide array of sensors and weapons. IACCS has been progressively expanded over the years to integrate the wide array of military radars with civilian radars. Apart from ground-based radars, the existing Netra and Phalcon airborne early-warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft are also part of this network.","India has shored up its defences across the land, air and sea domains.

India will retaliate resolutely if Pakistan escalates: Doval,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/post-strike-india-mounts-fresh-diplomatic-offensive/articleshow/120976551.cms,"NSA Ajit Doval (Pic credit: PTI)

NEW DELHI: Almost immediately after Indian forces pounded terrorist camps in Pakistan and PoK to rubble, NSA Ajit Doval reached out to his counterparts from across the world, including the US, UK, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Japan to brief them about India’s non-escalatory and restrained response. According to government sources, he briefed them about the method of execution of the military strikes, while stressing that India had no intention to escalate but was prepared to retaliate “resolutely” if Pakistan chooses to respond militarily.Doval also spoke to his counterparts from Russia, France and China. The NSA explained to his counterparts that India’s action was precise and focused, and no civilian, military or economic targets were hit. Most countries are said to have been supportive of India’s “zero tolerance” policy towards the terrorism, even as they urged both India and Pakistan to exercise restraint and de-escalate.US secretary of state and NSA Marco Rubio urged both sides to keep lines of communication open and avoid escalation. Both Japan and China called for restraint, while condemning terrorism. China, however, described the military strikes as regrettable.Separately, foreign minister S Jaishankar had a telecon with his counterparts from Germany and France, appreciating their solidarity with India and support for zero-tolerance towards terrorism. Foreign secretary Vikram Misri also briefed envoys of 13 countries, all UNSC member-states including China, and raised 4 issues with them. These included the current escalation by the Pakistani side including at the LoC, its shielding of LeT-backed TRF, targeted Indian response and the barbaric way tourists in Pahalgam were killed. He’s also learnt to have spoken about cross-border linkages of the terrorists including their communication nodes in and to Pakistan.Misri too made it clear that if Pakistan responds, India will respond too. Responding to a question from one of the ambassadors, the foreign secretary said that the onus of de-escalation was on Pakistan as India had only responded to a terrorist attack. Asked if India had achieved its objective, Misri pointed to the fact that India had hit 9 terror camps. The UK asked about the targeting of civilians in a mosque, to which Misri said the structure comprised a complex that included a terror camp. The Indian mission in the UN, sources said, is also reaching out to UNSC members in New York.Important partners like Russia and Japan strongly condemned terrorism but also urged India and Pakistan to avoid any escalation. Japanese foreign minister Takeshi Iwaya spoke to Jaishankar and said that “fair investigation and punishment” of offenders of this terrorist attack are important.Iwaya also stated that Japan is deeply concerned that the recent series of events could lead to further reprisals and escalate into a full-scale military conflict, while urging both India and Pakistan to exercise restraint and stabilize the situation through dialogue for peace and stability in South Asia. Russia again called upon both countries to resolve their agreements in line with the 1972 Simla Agreement and the 1999 Lahore Declaration. France also sought restraint and de-escalation.","NSA Ajit Doval reached out to his counterparts from across the world to brief them about India’s non-escalatory and restrained response.

NEW DELHI: Home minister Amit Shah on Wednesday asked states and Union Territories bordering Pakistan and Nepal to be on high alert and bolster security at all vulnerable points, particularly vital installations, to beat any exigency including armed retaliation by Pakistan.At a security review held via video-conferencing with lieutenant governors and chief ministers of border states/UTs like J&K, Ladakh, UP, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Rajasthan, Gujarat and West Bengal and a representative of Sikkim govt - where the home secretary, Intelligence Bureau chief and DGs of Border Security Force ( BSF ) and Central Industrial Security Force ( CISF ) were also present - Shah called for seamless coordination among the local administration, armed forces and the central paramilitary forces.Shah's exhortation followed an assessment by the security establishment that Pakistan, hamstrung by India's decision to focus the precision strikes exclusively on terror camps while ensuring that no civilian and military targets were hit, could target crucial installations. ""We don't run terror camps... our installations such as dams, refineries, power plants, particularly those on the western border, could be targeted,"" a source said.Many of these installations are protected by CISF, which has already reviewed and upgraded their security plan. Shah asked the LGs/chief ministers to keep the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), civil defence, Home Guards, NCC etc on standby to deal with any situation. He said efforts should be made to ensure public participation in Wednesday's mock drill through citizens and non-government organisations.Shah asked states/UTs to keep strict vigil on anti-national propaganda by unwanted elements on social and other media platforms and sought prompt action against them in coordination with central agencies. He said every effort should be made to maintain seamless communication and strengthen security of vulnerable points. Shah cautioned states and UTs to make sure there was no fear-mongering among the public and that rumours were kept in check by timely dissemination of information and spreading awareness.Meanwhile, Pakistani forces on Wednesday resorted to heavy shelling in sectors like Poonch and Uri, which was strongly retaliated by Indian forces. There are reports of casualties on both sides, though an official confirmation is awaited. Sources in BSF, which guards the international border and parts of the LoC in J&K with the Army, said the leaves of BSF personnel deployed on the western border has been cancelled. ""As the personnel rejoin duty on the IB/LoC, the force deployment levels will be enhanced by almost 25%.

Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav , too, said his party stood firmly with the government to root out terrorism, but cautioned that it would be a long drawn battle with no scope for any lapses.""No one will accept lapses in securing India. We are fully confident of our armed forces which are securing our borders,"" the former UP chief minister said.","Tamil Nadu chief minister and DMK supremo M K Stalin praised the Army's valour.

Congress seeks to ensure messaging aligned with public mood,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-seeks-to-ensure-messaging-aligned-with-public-mood/articleshow/120978580.cms,"NEW DELHI: The idea behind holding a third CWC meeting on the post-Pahalgam situation and the conflict with Pakistan is being seen as another attempt by Congress to ensure discipline in the party's messaging, with its reiteration of unconditional support to the government appearing to be aimed at sending a message down the rank and file.The CWC statement after the Pahalgam attack on April 22 had extended full support to the government to take decisive action against Pakistan, but also spoke about ""security lapse and intelligence failure"".But the statement issued on Wednesday after the meeting of the panel steered clear of any such demand for accountability. Sources said in the wake of the armed action, there is no room for any other issue then focusing on Pakistan and national security.Congress is going to amplify this message in the all party meeting scheduled for Thursday, specially by deputing party president Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi for the government briefing.However, the larger idea is to ensure that no loose comments from party leaders derail the leadership's bid to ensure that its messaging is in line with the public mood and also helps its bid to undo the past damages.Congress had to issue a gag order after remarks from party leaders questioning the BJP government over Pahalgam spoilt the mood that the leadership had sought to build.The attacks by the ruling BJP on Congress over a caricature of PM Narendra Modi on social media specially hurt the party.There is also a regret about Punjab MP Charanjit Channi last week reviving the controversy triggered by party leaders where they sought evidence of the Balakot bombings in 2019, the situation made worse by the fact that Channi was fielded to brief about the CWC meeting which extended support to the government over the Pahalgam attacks. The party has been trying hard to live down the post Balakot faux pas by its leaders.Sources said the hope now is that congress focus in the all party meeting on Thursday will help in further solidifying its positioning post Pahalgam.","The CWC statement after the Pahalgam attack on April 22 had extended full support to the government to take decisive action against Pakistan.

Armed forces scripted history: Defence minister









NEW DELHI: It was a cold, calculated, carefully calibrated retribution after keeping Pakistan on edge for 15 days since the Pahalgam terror massacre. In the early hours of Wednesday, India carried out precision strikes on nine terror hubs in Pakistan and POK to ""successfully destroy them"" in a synchronised operation by the IAF and Army.Under the tellingly named Operation Sindoor , a strike package of Rafale, Mirage-2000 and Sukhoi-30MKI fighters fired a salvo of long-range missiles and 'smart' glide bombs without crossing the Line of Control (LoC) or international boundary (IB) in J&K after taking off from different bases in the hinterland. AEW&C (airborne early warning and control) aircraft served as the 'eyes and ears' of the supersonic jets for the mission.Simultaneously, Army units launched loitering munitions or Kamikaze drones for long-range airstrikes and fired 'smart' extended range artillery shells to hammer specific targets based on hard and credible intelligence.It's difficult to correctly assess the number of terrorists killed on the ground during Operation Sindoor, but intelligence estimates said the toll could be in the range of 70 to 100. ""It would have been quite high at the two nerve centres in Muridke and Bahawalpur,"" a source said.The high-tempo blitz, from 1.04am to 1.30am, targeted four terror camps in Pakistan and five in Pak-occupied Kashmir. The Army took on seven camps that were relatively closer, while IAF handled the other two, sources told TOI.The targets ranged from Sawai Nala camp in Muzaffarabad in the north, around 30km from the LoC, to Markaz Taiba in Muridke (Lashkar-e-Taiba HQ) about 25km from the IB, and Markaz Subhan Allah at Bahawalpur (Jaish-e-Muhammed HQ), around 100km away, in the south.""India exercised its right to respond and pre-empt as well as deter more such cross-border attacks. These actions were measured, non-escalatory, proportionate, and responsible,"" foreign secretary Vikram Misri said. ""They focused on dismantling the terrorist infrastructure and disabling terrorists likely to be sent across to India,"" he added, flanked by Colonel Sofiya Qureshi and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh at a briefing.Video footage was released to underline the strategic and operational success of Operation Sindoor.The absence of such evidence during the air strikes on the JeM terror facility at Balakot in Feb 2019 had led some quarters to doubt the claims at that time.Wing Commander Singh said the strikes on the nine terror camps were undertaken through “precision capability using niche technology, with careful selection of warheads” that ensured no collateral damage. “The point of impact in each target was a specific building or a group of buildings. All the targets were neutralised with clinical efficiency… No military establishments were targeted,” she said.Col Qureshi, in turn, added, “The target locations (nine of the 21 identified camps) were selected to avoid damage to civilian infrastructures and loss of any civilian lives. This was done with due diligence.”Speaking at a function later in the day, defence minister Rajnath Singh said India through Operation Sindoor had used its “right to respond” to the dastardly attack on its soil at Pahalgam. “The armed forces scripted history by acting with precision, precaution and compassion to destroy the camps used to train terrorists in Pakistan and POK. The action was carried out very thoughtfully and in a measured manner. It was limited only to the camps and other infrastructure used for training terrorists, with the aim of breaking their morale,” he said.","The strike package of Rafale, Mirage-2000 and Sukhoi-30MKI fighters fired a salvo of long-range missiles and'smart' glide bombs.

‘Operation Sindoor’ strikes nine terror camps across PoK, Pakistan in response to Pahalgam attack

Pahalgam attack aimed to derail peace: Foreign Secy

NEW DELHI: Wing Commander Vyomika Singh , a decorated helicopter pilot with the Indian Air Force , on Wednesday jointly led the high-profile media briefing on ' Operation Sindoor ', India’s retaliatory strike on terror camps in Pakistan and PoK, following the massacre of 26 civilians in Jammu & Kashmir’s Pahalgam on April 22, 2025.She was joined by Colonel Sophia Qureshi of the Indian Army during the first official press conference on the operation.The two officers, representing the IAF and the Army, outlined the objectives and outcomes of the strike.Vyomika Singh’s journey to the Indian Air Force began early. Inspired by the skies since her school days, her name itself — Vyomika, meaning ""the one who resides in the sky"", seemed to script her destiny. A engineering graduate, she became the first in her family to join the armed forces and was commissioned into the IAF as a helicopter pilot.Wing Commander Singh has logged over 2,500 flying hours, piloting aircraft like the Chetak and Cheetah across some of India’s most hostile terrains, including Jammu & Kashmir and the Northeast. In November 2020, she led a key rescue mission in Arunachal Pradesh, navigating through harsh weather and high altitudes.In 2021, Singh was part of a tri-services all-women expedition to Mt Manirang, a 21,650-feet Himalayan peak. Her participation in such missions has been recognised by senior defence leadership and reflects the growing leadership roles being taken up by women in the Indian military.In a response to the terror attack in Pahalgam, the Indian Armed Forces carried out pre-dawn strikes on Wednesday under 'Operation Sindoor', targeting and destroying nine terror hideouts deep inside Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).Briefing the media alongside Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri and Col Sofiya Qureshi, Wing Commander Vyomika Singh said the operation was designed to ensure justice for the victims of the Pahalgam massacre and their families. “Nine terrorist camps were targeted and successfully destroyed. All locations were carefully chosen to prevent any civilian casualties or damage to civilian infrastructure,” she said.Col Sofiya Qureshi presented video evidence of the strikes, confirming that the targeted camps included those at Muridke—where 26/11 attackers David Headley and Ajmal Kasab were trained—along with the Sarjal camp in Sialkot, Markaz Ahle Hadith, Barnala, Markaz Abbas in Kotli, and Mehmoona Joya camp in Sialkot.Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri described the Pahalgam attack as an act of deliberate brutality intended to disrupt the return of peace to Jammu and Kashmir. “The victims were shot at close range, often in front of their families, who were deliberately traumatised. The objective was to send a message and destabilise normalcy in the region,” he said.Misri added that Indian intelligence agencies had credible inputs indicating further terror plots. “Our intelligence suggested more attacks were being planned. India had both the compulsion and the right to act. This morning’s response was calibrated, proportionate, and intended to prevent future cross-border terror threats,” he said.","Wing Commander Vyomika Singh has logged over 2,500 flying hours, piloting aircraft like the Chetak and Cheetah across some of India’s most hostile terrains.

NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Wednesday praised the codename ' Operation Sindoor ' for India's retaliatory strike on nine terror targets in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, calling it “brilliant” for its emotional and symbolic resonance.""Clever, especially given the government’s penchant for creative acronyms! But jokes apart, #OperationSindoor is a brilliant name,"" Tharoor said in a post on X.""It evokes the image, seared into our national consciousness, of the newly-widowed bride, kneeling and weeping by the side of her assassinated husband of six days in Pahalgam – the entire reason why Operation #Sindoor was necessary. The fact that Sindoor is blood red also sends a telling message. Shabash to whoever thought of it!” the Congress leader said.Tharoor’s post referred to the emotional aftermath of the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, where 26 people, including newlywed Indian army personnel, were killed, sparking national outrage. The image of the soldier’s young widow mourning beside his body became a powerful symbol of the tragedy.He was replying to a post which claimed that 'Sindoor' was actually an acronym.Earlier in the day, top Congress leadership on Wednesday lauded the Indian armed forces for their bold and decisive step against terror camps in Pakistan and PoK and reiterated the party's support to the forces and the government's action on the issue of national security.""We had called a meeting of the Working Committee to discuss the incident and the government's action.

Our full support to our forces, best wishes to them, much love to them. Complete support from the Congress party and the Congress Working Committee,"" he said.In a 25-minute precision operation in early hours of Wednesday, Indian armed forces destroyed nine terrorist infrastructure sites in Pakistan and PoK, including facilities linked to Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). The strike was described by Indian officials as ""measured"" and ""non-escalatory,"" and came in direct retaliation to the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam.Foreign secretary Vikram Misri said the decision to carry out the ""proportionate"" strikes was driven by Pakistan’s failure to take any visible action against terrorist infrastructure operating from territories under its control.Under Operation Sindoor, Indian forces targeted key terrorist hubs, including the Markaz Taiba of LeT in Muridke, Markaz Subhan Allah of JeM in Bahawalpur, the Mehmoona Joya Facility of Hizbul Mujahideen in Sialkot, and LeT bases in Markaz Ahle Hadith in Barnala and Shawai Nalla in Muzaffarabad, according to military officials.The strikes were executed between 1.05 am and 1.30 am, with all targets successfully neutralised. Detailing the operation at a media briefing, Colonel Sophia Qureshi of the Army’s Corps of Signals and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh, a helicopter pilot with the Indian Air Force, confirmed the successful execution alongside Foreign Secretary Misri.About 15 minutes after the operation concluded, the Ministry of Defence issued a statement: “A little while ago, the Indian Armed Forces launched ‘Operation Sindoor’, targeting terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir from where attacks against India have been planned and directed.”The ministry stressed that the strikes were “focused, measured and non-escalatory in nature” and confirmed that “no Pakistani military facilities were targeted.” It added that India had exercised “considerable restraint in the selection of targets and method of execution.”Military sources noted that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was closely monitoring Operation Sindoor. Following the operation, he convened a meeting of the Union Cabinet and lauded the Indian armed forces for the successful and precise strikes.","Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Wednesday praised the codename'Operation Sindoor'for India's retaliatory strike on nine terror targets in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

Her brother, Sanjay Qureshi, shared, “My grandfather and my father were both in the army. My father was with the EME Corps in Vadodara and even served during the 1971 war. My father's maternal grandfather also served in the British Army and later participated in the 1857 freedom struggle.”Her family resides in the Tandalja locality of Vadodara and she has three brothers and a sister.Qureshi completed her schooling at Kendriya Vidyalaya, EME, and went on to earn a BSc in Chemistry (1992–1995) and an MSc in Biochemistry (1995–1997) from the Faculty of Science at M S University.“She was even pursuing her PhD, but learning about the recruitment of women officers in the Indian Army, she quit the PhD programme and joined the forces,” said Sanjay.For young Indian women seeking meaningful and challenging careers, she had a clear message: “If possible, join the Indian Army.”Southern Army Commander Lt Gen Bipin Rawat in 2016 commended her leadership, noting that the Army believes in equal opportunity and responsibility for all personnel, regardless of gender.""Nine terrorist camps were destroyed. The targets were selected based on credible intelligence and their direct involvement in cross-border terrorism. No military installation in Pakistan was targeted during Operation Sindoor.""Under 'Operation Sindoor', the armed forces on Wednesday targeted and destroyed nine terror hideouts belonging to Jaish-e-Mohammed Lashkar-e-Taiba , and Hizbul Mujahideen in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.This marked India's most decisive strike in response to the recent Pahalgam terror attack , in which 26 civilians were killed.According to the Ministry of Defence, the Indian Air Force conducted precision strikes on four terror sites inside Pakistan and five within PoK. The ministry described the operation as “focused, measured and non-escalatory,” adding that no Pakistani military installations were targeted.“These actions are in direct response to the horrific Pahalgam attack,” the Defence Ministry said in its statement, adding, “We are upholding our commitment to ensure that those responsible for the attack face consequences.” The Indian government later released an official video declaring the mission a success, while Pakistani authorities were reportedly caught off guard.","Colonel Sofiya Qureshi is an officer from the Indian Army’s Corps of Signals.

‘Lying for a 20-second donation hit’: Kash Patel clashes with Madeline Dean over 'FBI weaponisation',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/lying-for-a-20-second-donation-hit-kash-patel-clashes-with-madeline-dean-over-fbi-weaponisation/articleshow/120982391.cms,"



FBI Director Kash Patel and Democratic Rep. Madeline Dean clashed during a heated House subcommittee hearing , with Patel accusing Dean of misrepresenting facts and Dean charging that the FBI under Patel had been weaponised to pursue political enemies Dean, who served as an impeachment manager during President Trump’s second impeachment trial, launched a pointed line of questioning at Patel. “As you and the president continue to weaponise and investigate his perceived enemies... when can I, a former impeachment manager, expect the FBI at my door?” she asked.Patel shot back, “Ma’am. You want to know who was targeted by a weaponised FBI? Me. You want to know how and why? You want to know what I'm doing to fix it?”As Dean attempted to move on, Patel continued, “You should read the book, because there's no enemies list in that book. There are people that violated their constitutional obligations and their duties to the American people, and they were rightly called out. And you should give that book to every one of your constituents so they can read about it.”Dean then accused Patel of dishonesty during his Senate confirmation hearings, referring to his denial of involvement in the firing of FBI officials after the January 6 riot and his repeated appearances on the podcast of Stu Peters, whom she labelled “an anti-Semitic Holocaust denier”.She asked, “Should we worry more about your memory or your veracity?”Patel hit back strongly. “We should worry more about your lack of candour. You're accusing me of committing perjury. Tell the American people how I broke the law and committed a felony. Have the audacity to actually put the facts forward instead of lying for political banter so you can have a 20 second donation hit.”He added, “The answer is both. I believe that the answer is you're failing. Not me.”Dean insisted the FBI’s rank-and-file deserved better. “I believe that the members of the FBI... deserve the very best, deserve extraordinary independence, deserve freedom from the fears of being investigated.”The tense exchange came as Patel also faced criticism over a proposed $500 million cut to the FBI's 2026 budget, backed by the Trump White House. Though the administration framed the cuts as a move to “streamline” the bureau, Patel warned such reductions would harm the agency’s capacity to tackle violent crime.“We need more than what has been proposed,” he told lawmakers, adding that the FBI was working on relocating 1,000 staff to areas most affected by violent crime. “We’ve taken a process... and said, ‘Where are some of the most violent crime places in America?’”When pressed on which positions would be cut if the funding decrease goes ahead, Patel responded, “At this time, we have not looked at who to cut. We are focusing our energies on how not to have them cut.”","FBI Director Kash Patel and Democratic Rep. Madeline Dean clashed during a heated House subcommittee hearing.

Over 50 students arrested in pro-Palestinian protest at Columbia University,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/over-50-students-arrested-in-pro-palestinian-protest-at-columbia-university/articleshow/120981871.cms,"Over 50 students arrested in pro-Palestinian protest at Columbia University (Picture credit: NYT)





Over 50 pro-Palestinian demonstrators were arrested Wednesday evening after occupying a reading room in Columbia University’s Butler Library, in a protest that reignited tensions over the Gaza war on US campuses.The occupation began around 3 pm (local time), when masked protesters, many wearing keffiyehs, stormed into the second-floor reading room of Butler Library.Videos shared online showed students chanting “We have nothing to lose but our chains!” while declaring the area a “liberated zone” and renaming it the “Basel Al-Araj Popular University.”Al-Araj was a Palestinian activist killed by Israeli forces in 2017.Protesters draped banners reading “Strike for Gaza,” stood on desks using megaphones, and distributed pamphlets calling for Columbia to divest from firms allegedly profiting from Israel’s military campaign.Some demonstrators defaced library walls and tables, according to New York Post, while one sign inside reportedly read “Columbia Will Burn.”University officials initially deployed campus security, warning students they could face disciplinary action and arrest if they didn’t leave.But when protesters refused to show identification and described being “kettled” inside, the standoff escalated.Acting Columbia president Claire Shipman then requested the NYPD’s intervention.""Requesting the presence of the NYPD is not the outcome we wanted, but it was absolutely necessary to secure the safety of our community,"" Shipman said in a statement quoted by The New York Times.The university reported that two public safety officers were injured in a crowd surge. Protesters also claimed some injuries, with one seen leaving on a stretcher, partially covered, with an ice pack on their arm.The NYPD arrived in riot gear around 7 pm (local time), entering the library and arresting 75 individuals, according to The Guardian. Video footage showed protesters being led out in zip ties and loaded into waiting buses. A message sent to students at 6 pm (local time) had warned that the library was closed and the area “must be cleared.”New York Mayor Eric Adams called the protest “unacceptable” and was quoted by NBC as saying that the NYPD acted upon a written request from the university. “We will never tolerate lawlessness,” he said in a later statement, adding that protesters who are not affiliated with Columbia should leave or face arrest. Governor Kathy Hochul also weighed in, saying, “Everyone has the right to peacefully protest. But violence, vandalism or destruction of property are completely unacceptable. ”US secretary of state Marco Rubio said the visa status of international students involved in the protest would be reviewed, calling the demonstrators “pro-Hamas thugs” in a statement. Jewish student groups also criticised the protest, with one group sharing an image of the vandalised library and saying it was ""unacceptable to have fully masked strangers barging into learning institutions.""The protest comes as Columbia faces pressure from the Trump administration, which cut over $400 million in federal research funding due to the university’s alleged failure to protect Jewish students.As per The New York Times, officials are currently in talks to restore that funding. The university on Tuesday announced layoffs of nearly 180 staff, largely tied to research grants affected by the cuts.The Butler Library protest echoed last spring’s occupation of Hamilton Hall and a broader encampment movement on US campuses. Since then, Columbia has tightened security, banned masks during demonstrations, and authorised 36 campus safety officers to make arrests.As per The Guardian, Columbia’s leadership has seen multiple changes amid backlash over the administration’s perceived compliance with federal demands that critics argue threaten academic freedom.Columbia University Apartheid Divest(CUAD), which organised Wednesday’s action, has drawn criticism for supporting armed resistance. The group’s latest statement called on students “to propagate the successes of the heroic Palestinian armed resistance in weakening Israel and US imperialism.”As final exams approach, university officials have pledged consequences. “Disruptions to our academic activities will not be tolerated,” said Shipman. “This is especially unacceptable while our students study and prepare for final exams.”","Over 50 students arrested in pro-Palestinian protest at Columbia University.

ISLAMABAD: Hours after Operation Sindoor Pakistan PM Shahbaz Sharif , while addressing a session of parliament on Wednesday, lauded his country’s army for its ‘swift response’ to Indian strikes and claimed that it had shot down five jets of the neighbouring country. However, he did not provide any evidence to back his claim.A Pakistani army spokesperson said at least 26 people were killed and 46 were injured in Indian strikes on six locations past midnight in PoK and the Punjab province. Pakistan’s military spokesperson, Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, said 13 deaths were reported in Bahawalpur’s Ahmedpur East, claiming that the Subhan Allah mosque was attacked. Other casualties were reported from PoK’s Kotli, Muzaffarabad and Mirpur districts and Muridke in Punjab.In Parliament, Sharif alleged that India had responded with ‘aggression’ despite Pakistan’s ‘offer’ for a transparent international probe into the Pahalgam massacre. He said 80 Indian aircraft were part of the offensive, but Pakistan’s air defence ‘effectively neutralised’ the threat. He claimed that Pakistan’s military had ‘prior intelligence’ about India’s plans.Earlier, at an emergency meeting of National Security Committee (NSC), which was chaired by Sharif and attended by top military and civilian leaders, Pakistan condemned India’s coordinated attacks as ‘acts of war’.NSC directed the armed forces to deliver a “befitting response to the unprovoked strikes”.Accusing New Delhi of “igniting an inferno in the region”, NSC said in a statement that “the responsibility for ensuing consequences shall lie squarely with India”.NSC warned that in consonance with Article 51 of the UN Charter, Islamabad reserved its right to respond in self-defence “at a time, place, and manner of its choosing” to avenge the loss of “innocent Pakistani lives” in the Indian strikes. The Pakistani nation, the statement added, stands “galvanised and resolute”, rallying behind its armed forces’ courage.NSC alleged that Indian strikes deliberately targeted civilian areas “on the false pretext of presence of imaginary terrorist camps”.Pakistan’s foreign minister Ishaq Dar said Islamabad had exercised restraint in the face of New Delhi’s strikes.Meanwhile, Dar briefed Chinese ambassador to Pakistan, Jiang Zaidong, who called on the former after the Indian strikes, according to the Foreign Office. “The two sides exchanged views on regional security developments and agreed to maintain close coordination and communication across all relevant areas,” Foreign Office said in a statement.",PM Shahbaz Sharif lauded his country’s army for its ‘swift response’ to Indian strikes and claimed that it had shot down five jets.

(Picture credit: AP)

Poll Do you think Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney effectively countered President Trump's claims about trade during their meeting? Yes, he did a great job. No, he could have done better.





What began as a standard diplomatic visit quickly turned into a high-stakes exchange when Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney fact-checked US President Donald Trump during their first official meeting at the White House on Tuesday.As cameras rolled in the Oval Office, Trump downplayed Canada’s trade significance to the United States, claiming, “We don’t do much business with Canada from our standpoint. They do a lot of business with us. We’re at like 4%.”But Carney, calm and composed, stepped in firmly.“Respectfully, Canadians’ view on this is not going to change on the 51st state,” Carney said, referring to his early days in office and Trump’s earlier remark about annexing Canada. He continued, “We are the largest client of the United States in the totality of all the goods.”As reported by CNN, Trump’s “4%” figure is false. In reality, Canada purchased about 17% of all US goods exports in February and March 2025, according to official US trade data—more than any other country. In total, Canada bought around $440 billion worth of US goods and services in 2024, making it the top destination for American exports, as confirmed by the US trade representative.Carney, pressing the point further, highlighted how deeply integrated both nations’ economies are. “We have a tremendous auto sector between the two of us. You know, 50% of a car that comes from Canada is American. That’s not like anywhere else in the world,” he said.According to the AP, Carney also stood firm on Canada’s sovereignty when Trump floated the idea of annexing Canada. “Some places are never for sale,” he told Trump directly. “Canada is one of them. And it won’t be for sale, ever.”Trump smirked and replied, “Never say never,” to which Carney responded with a quiet but resolute “Never, never, never.”Despite the tension, Trump appeared to appreciate Carney’s straightforward approach. “I like this guy,” the president said as the meeting wrapped up, a remark that seemed to signal respect more than irritation.But the session was emblematic of how Oval Office meetings have changed under Trump. As reported by AP, these events have evolved from formal photo ops into unpredictable exchanges where foreign leaders must choose between confrontation and diplomacy.During the meeting, Trump also wandered into unrelated topics, including complaints about California’s rail project, jabs at Barack Obama’s library, and a sudden announcement to halt bombing in Yemen, leaving Carney visibly uneasy.At one point, the Canadian leader’s lips tightened and his hands remained clasped as he struggled to reinsert the conversation into serious policy territory.Trump also repeated a long-debunked claim, stating that the US was “subsidising Canada to the tune of maybe $200 billion per year.”However, the actual US trade deficit with Canada in 2024 was about $36 billion, far from Trump’s exaggerated number, reported CNN. Even when counting only goods, the gap was around $71 billion, not a subsidy and nowhere near $200 billion.","Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney fact-checked US President Donald Trump during their first official meeting at the White House.

Morning Joe forced to add clarification on Kash Patel-night club claim







FBI spokesperson Ben Williamson slammed former FBI official Frank Figliuzzi for claiming that Kash Patel is seen more at night clubs than in the office, and said Figliuzzi has made up everything he said. The comment came at MSNBC's Morning Joe program, which too issued a clarification about the viral claim and said that it was not verified by MSNBC.Figliuzzi claimed that he got to know that Kash Patel is visible at nightclubs far more than he has been on the seventh floor of the Hoover building. He also claimed that Patel reduced the frequency of briefings -- from daily briefings to twice weekly. He claimed that Patel works from Las Vegas home mostly as he is splitting his time between DC and Las Vegas.Williamson, assistant director for public affairs at the FBI, said Figluizii made up both the nightclub and the Las Vegas part because Kash went home for a total of three days since he became the FBI director. ""Bogus. Kash has been Director for 70+ days and has been home for a total of three days. I see him here at HQ every day,"" Williamson said.Host Jonathan Lemire on Monday referred to the Kash Patel-nightclub claim that was made on Friday's show and said: ""Let's circle back to a segment from Friday’s show.Frank Figliuzzi was on that morning during this hour, discussing the work of administration officials.""“At the end of that segment, Figliuzzi said that FBI director Kash Patel has reportedly been more visible at nightclubs than at his office at FBI headquarters. This was a misstatement. We have not verified that claim.”The claim went viral as Kash Patel was already on the radar for his usage of FBI jets for personal trips. Senate Democrats have asked the U.S. Government Accountability Office to review the FBI Director Kash Patel's personal travel on government aircraft, CBS reported.","FBI spokesperson Ben Williamson slammed former FBI official Frank Figliuzzi for claiming that Kash Patel is seen more at night clubs than in the office.
