Idol immersion: JCB deployed to pull out trolley

INDORE: Vijayadashami celebrations ended in a tragedy as 11 people, mostly teenagers, drowned on Thursday evening when a tractor-trolley carrying devotees who had gone for Durga idol immersion overturned in a pond in Ardala village of MP’s Khandwa district. The accident took place when the tractor-trolley, carrying about 20-25 people, lost balance and toppled into the water.Officials said a local kotwar had cautioned the driver against taking the tractor-trolley into the water body, but the warning was ignored. The vehicle, while reversing, likely hit a stone and overturned, throwing all occupants into the pond. Many managed to swim to safety, but 11 could not be rescued, said DIG Bahuguna.CM Mohan Yadav expressed grief over the loss of lives and announced an ex gratia of Rs 4 lakh each for the families of the deceased. Khandwa DIG Siddharth Bahuguna said seven of the deceased were females and that there were eight minors among the dead.Three others were admitted to hospital. One remains critical while the other two are out of danger,” Khandwa DIG Siddharth Bahuguna said. Rescue operations began immediately, with police, administration and local teams rushing to the spot. A JCB machine was deployed to pull out the trolley. By 6pm, 10 bodies had been recovered, and after a three-hour search, the body of the last missing child — an eight-year-old girl — was found around 8.45pm.","A tractor-trolley carrying devotees who had gone for Durga idol immersion overturned in a pond in Ardala village of MP’s Khandwa district.

Police Lathicharge Protesters After Violence Breaks Out In Bareilly During ‘I Love Muhammad’ March

Govt using police to silence victims, oppn: Bhim Army chief

MEERUT/BAREILLY: Internet services, including mobile data, broadband and SMS services, were suspended across Bareilly on Thursday afternoon amid fears of unrest on Friday when people will gather to offer juma namaz. According to a govt notification, internet services will remain suspended in Bareilly from 3 pm on Oct 2 to 3 pm on Oct 4.Security has been tightened across four districts in Bareilly division, with heavy deployment of forces on streets and drones in air. Some sensitive areas in the city looked like fortresses, and many roads and lanes in localities remained deserted.City magistrate Alankar Agnihotri said, “Internet will remain suspended for 48 hours, considering the sensitivity of the situation.” The precaution follows last week’s clashes during a procession after Friday prayers over ‘I Love Muhammad’ row. Police resorted to lathi charge to control the situation. So far, over 80 people, including local cleric and Ittehad-e-Millat Council president Tauqeer Raza Khan, his close associates Dr Nafees Khan and Nadeem Khan, have been arrested.On Thursday, Ala Hazrat Association urged the people to offer Friday namaz peacefully and return home promptly.From the Sunni Markaz at Dargah Ala Hazrat, Jamaat Raza-e-Mustafa national vice-president Salman Hasan Khan appealed to imams and the public to maintain peace, avoid rumours and cooperate with authorities. He also requested special prayers during Friday sermons for harmony.In Muslim-majority areas fears of impending action by the administration prevailed. Teams from Bareilly Development Authority are surveying properties to identify violations. Structures without approved maps or violating building regulations will face notices, sealing and demolition.The authority’s vice-chairman Manikandan A said, “Action is being taken at every level against those accused of rioting and their supporters. Every illegal brick will be accounted for. This drive will serve as a lesson to accused and a warning to others who break the law”.In Saharanpur, Chandrashekhar Azad was put under house arrest as he was planning to meet families of those affected in last week’s violence. Azad accused govt of “using police to silence victims and opposition voices” and demanded an impartial probe into the violence.“Following a letter from Bareilly district magistrate, police force from Fatehpur and Dehat police stations were deployed outside Azad’s house in Chhutmalpur area of Saharanpur. His presence in Bareilly might lead to law-and-order issues in that city,” Saharanpur SSP Ashish Tiwari told TOI.On Wednesday, two Congress leaders — Saharanpur MP Imran Masood and former MP from Amroha Kunwar Danish Ali —were put under house arrest to stop them from visiting Bareilly.","Internet services, including mobile data, broadband and SMS services, were suspended across Bareilly on Thursday afternoon.

NEW DELHI: A scuffle broke out between ABVP and Left-affiliated outfits and charges and counter-charges were traded in JNU over a Ravan Dahan and a Durga immersion on Thursday.The Leftist outfits alleged that an effigy of former students Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam - who are facing trial in a 2020 Delhi riots case - along with Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru, was burnt during a Ravan Dahan. They accused ABVP of communal propaganda. ABVP, on the other hand, alleged that its Durga immersion procession was attacked.Videos from the campus showed groups of students raising slogans and flashing slippers, while security personnel formed a chain to prevent an escalation.TOI was unable to independently confirm the details of the two events.ABVP said the effigy burning was symbolic of the end of ""Naxalism, Leftism, Maoist violence and anti-national ideologies"". Khalid, Imam, Guru and Naxal movement leaders Charu Mazumdar and Kanu Sanyal had replaced Ravan's heads. ABVP, on the other hand, said the Left groups threw stones and abused students at the Durga Visarjan. JNUSU joint secretary Vaibhav Meena, who is from ABVP, said it was a ""direct assault on the cultural harmony of the university"" and ""the soil of JNU will no longer be the centre for glorifying Naxalism and Leftist mentality"".ABVP's statement said that the Left groups ""attacked"" the immersion procession near the Sabarmati T-Point around 7 pm"". It said several students were injured, PTI reported.The Left-affiliated outfits rejected the claim. They asked why Nathuram Godse or Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh were not depicted as Ravan.

Poll Should there be stricter regulations on how schools discipline students? Yes, to protect student rights. No, schools need the freedom to manage behavior.





CHANDIGARH: The principal and driver of a private school in Sonipat have been arrested for brutally thrashing a class 2 student.

'Pakistan Could Not Kill Him But...': Father On Kargil War Veteran Killed In Ladakh Clashes

Poll Do you think Ladakh should have more local governance powers? Yes, more autonomy is needed No, current administration is sufficient

LEH: At Martyrs’ Park, about 1km from the Ladakh Hill Development Council (LAHDC-Leh) office, the gate stood open during curfew relaxation. Inside, chairs were stacked and a tent was dismantled. Labourers were quietly loading chairs, tent covers and iron rods into a vehicle, their faces grim.It was here that environmental activist Sonam Wangchuk began a 35-day hunger strike Sept 10, demanding Sixth Schedule protections and statehood for Ladakh. “We provide tents on rent. They called us to take it back,” a worker said. Startled at the sight of a reporter, he said, “Please go away, cops will come and we will be in trouble.”A woman entered with her child. “I was on hunger strike on Sept 24 when the situation worsened outside,” she said. “Out of fear, some of us ran in different directions. My husband later picked me up. I came back to collect my belongings.”On Sept 24, security forces opened fire on protesters demanding Sixth Schedule status, killing four and injuring dozens. Wangchuk called off his hunger strike hours later. Authorities said the police fired in self-defence after protesters tried to set ablaze a vehicle carrying security personnel.Police also claimed that without CRPF deployment, “the whole of Leh would have burnt”.Outside the park, another woman voiced her anger. “Why were people fired upon? Four people are dead. Will they give us Sixth Schedule?”About 1km away BJP’s Ladakh office, which was set on fire, was under heavy guard with spools of concertina wire around it. Cops prohibit photography of the building.At the LAHDC-Leh office, the main gate was open but there was no one there. “Since Sept 24, chief executive officer Tashi Gyalson and others haven’t come to office. In fact, no one comes,” a peon said.Mustafa Ladakhi, 36, a PhD from JNU, is among a growing number of Ladakhis at the country’s top universities concerned about home. At a hotel near Leh airport, he said the region is still in shock.“On Sept 24, my mother was on a hunger strike led by Wangchuk. There was chaos when she called me. I found her in the middle of the road. I will never forget the pain that day brought to Ladakhis,” he said. “No official has stepped down. There is no empathy. There is no apology. Instead, we are accused in the national media of destabilising the central govt... How can we be a threat when we have paid with our lives for the nation?”He argued that UT status without statehood had buried local governance under bureaucracy. “Instead of empowering local govt, we have the lieutenant governor’s office and its bureaucracy, commissioner secretaries, the DC’s office, and the police bureaucracy. They have nothing to do in Ladakh. All we see is pomp and a show of bureaucracy... Allow us to govern ourselves,” he said.“When we were part of J&K, AFSPA was never extended to Ladakh because govt knew we were Indian nationalists. Why this labelling now?” he asked.Ladakhi’s friend, a hotel owner, said, “I don’t want to talk about tourism. This is a colossal tragedy. Four deaths in a place like Ladakh are like 400 in Delhi. Sept 24 will remain etched in our memory.”In Upper Tukchal area of Leh, Rigzin Wangmo Lachic, president of All Ladakh Hotel and Guest House Association, echoed similar sentiments and demanded a judicial inquiry. “The events have shattered us and left a wound on our collective soul,” she said.At a hotel serving Kashmiri wazwan on Oct 1, during curfew relaxation, the receptionist from Doda said he no longer felt safe. “I’ve been here 10 years and never faced hostility. But after the lieutenant governor described workers from Doda and Nepal as ‘external forces’ responsible for the crisis, we are not stepping out much.”As curfew returned, shops shut ahead of the 6 pm deadline. “We comply with every direction. But govt must fulfil our four demands, including Sixth Schedule and statehood,” Gelek Punchok, 42, a member of Leh Apex Body, said. Punchok was outside the district jail, with many others, to receive around 26 prisoners released Thursday after they were given bail. Many of the released detainees said they had nothing to do with the Sept 24 violence but stated that they were with the “peaceful” struggle for Sixth Schedule status and statehood.","Environmental activist Sonam Wangchuk began a 35-day hunger strike Sept 10, demanding Sixth Schedule protections and statehood for Ladakh.

NAGPUR: Former President Ram Nath Kovind , addressing the RSS centenary Vijayadashami celebrations in Nagpur on Thursday, sought to lend strength to the organisation’s Dalit outreach by using its stage to shower copious praise on Dr B R Ambedkar and highlight Sangh Parivar luminaries’ pro-Constitution stance.He quoted Atal Bihari Vajpayee ’s 2001 speech at a ‘Dalit Sangam’ rally at Red Fort, where the then PM had declared that governance would be based “not on Manusmriti but on Bhim Smriti — the Constitution of India”. Kovid also quoted Vajpayee as saying “we are Bhimwadi, which means Ambedkarwadi (Ambedkarite)”, at the same rally.The RSS is often accused of being “Manuwadi” and anti-Constitution by Congress and other opposition parties.Kovind said both Mahatma Gandhi and Dr Ambedkar had expressed admiration for Sangh’s discipline and inclusive approach. Kovind, noted that Gandhi praised the organisation for its negation of untouchability, and was “deeply impressed by the discipline, simplicity and equality he witnessed at an RSS camp”. Ambedkar, too, during a 1940 visit to an RSS shakha at Karad town in Maharashtra, conveyed a “sense of belonging” with the organisation, he said.",Ram Nath Kovind was addressing the RSS centenary Vijayadashami celebrations in Nagpur.

Reds hack villager to death in Bastar



RAIPUR: In a boost to Chhattisgarh govt’s surrender policy and a setback for banned CPI (Maoist), 103 Naxals, including 49 carrying a cumulative reward of Rs 1 crore, laid down arms before senior police and paramilitary officials in Bijapur district of Bastar division Thursday.Each surrendered cadre was given a cheque of Rs 50,000 as immediate assistance under the surrender and rehabilitation policy.“This is not merely a surrender of weapons, but the defeat of a Maoist ideology sustained for decades through violence,” said Dantewada range DIG Kamlochan Kashyap, who, along with CRPF Bijapur DIG B S Negi and Bijapur SP Jitendra Kumar Yadav, presided over the ceremony.SP Yadav said the rehabilitation scheme offers Maoists and their families a chance to live peacefully in the mainstream. Revolutionary people’s committees, once Maoists’ parallel governance structure, are collapsing as members return in large numbers. The killing of senior commanders in encounters and the surrender of top cadres have deepened the leadership vacuum, forcing lower-level members to give up arms, Yadav added.Appealing to remaining Maoists still active in jungles, the SP urged them to avail themselves of the policy.Since Jan 1, 410 Maoists have surrendered, 421 arrested, and 137 have been killed in Bijapur.A group of Maoists barged into a villager’s house, dragged him out, and hacked him to death in front of his family and relatives, accusing him of being a police informer, in Bijapur dist of Chhattisgarh’s Bastar division Wednesday night.Villagers alerted police, who rushed to the village and sent the body of Madkam Bhima for autopsy. Cops described the killing as another instance of Reds targeting innocent villagers to spread fear, particularly as security ops intensify in Bastar.","103 Naxals, including 49 carrying a cumulative reward of Rs 1 crore, laid down arms before senior police and paramilitary officials.

A five-year-old sexual assault lawsuit involving Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones will move forward after a Dallas County judge denied his request for summary judgment. The ruling, delivered on Thursday, keeps the case on track for a jury trial scheduled for July 20, 2026. The plaintiff, a South Carolina woman, alleges that Jones assaulted her during a private event at AT&T Stadium in 2018.Jerry Jones’ legal team, led by attorneys Levi McCathern and Ty Sheaks, argued that the claims lacked credibility and that no assault occurred. They presented photographs from the night in question, showing the plaintiff and her grandson smiling alongside Jones and former linebacker Jaylon Smith. Metadata revealed the photos were taken within minutes of the alleged incident, which Jones’ attorneys said contradicted the claim that both appeared distraught immediately afterward.Several witnesses, including former Cowboys coach Jason Garrett and ex-running back Ezekiel Elliott, testified they did not witness inappropriate conduct. McCathern described the lawsuit as “hogwash” and insisted Jones “didn’t do anything wrong.”He also challenged the credibility of a key witness who came forward years later, suggesting her testimony was fabricated.In contrast, the plaintiff’s attorneys argued that multiple witnesses, including the woman’s grandson, support the claim that an assault occurred. Lawyer Antwone Cobbin dismissed the summary judgment motion as “frivolous,” stressing that the jury should decide. Cobbin noted that several individuals observed the commotion that followed, with Jones allegedly being rushed out of the room.Originally filed in 2020, the lawsuit was dismissed in 2022 but reinstated on appeal. The case has faced repeated delays, with multiple trial dates rescheduled. Thursday’s ruling signals that the court believes the dispute centers on credibility and should be resolved by a jury.Although the trial is set for July 2026, legal experts note the case could settle before then. Often, a denial of summary judgment pushes both sides closer to a resolution. For now, the case stands as one of the most high-profile legal challenges involving an NFL owner in recent years, ensuring it will continue to draw national attention as the trial date approaches.Also Read: Legendary broadcaster slams Tom Brady’s Fox NFL commentary, says it’s so 'distracting' he can’t listen anymore","Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones is accused of sexually assaulting a woman at a private event in 2018.

Melvin Eng caught after Ryder Cup stunt spirals out of control



Trump Security Breach: Secret Service Fooled By 'FAKE GUARD' At Ryder Cup | WATCH

Donald Trump’s Ryder Cup appearance complicated security



A bizarre incident occurred at the Ryder Cup in Farmingdale, New York, when an NYPD detective allegedly disguised himself as part of Donald Trump ’s security team to slip into the tournament. The officer, later identified as Det. Melvin Eng, 46, reportedly managed to bypass tight layers of Secret Service and state police before his plan unraveled in embarrassing fashion. He is now suspended without pay and facing administrative charges.According to multiple reports, Melvin Eng, who was on sick leave at the time, arrived at Bethpage Black in full tactical gear. He claimed he was part of Donald Trump’s detail as the president attended Friday’s opening matches with his granddaughter, Kai.The elaborate ruse nearly worked until Eng dropped a gun magazine in front of actual security personnel. That blunder immediately drew suspicion and ultimately exposed his deception.“He got in there with his gun, past the Secret Service, past the state police,” one law enforcement source said. “What if he was looking to hurt someone?” Another veteran officer added, “You’re out sick, what are you doing at the Ryder Cup? You can’t do that.And it’s theft of service because you went in for free and then you lied and said you worked for Donald Trump.”Eng, who also serves as president of the NYPD Asian Jade Society, has been accused of theft of services and suspended for his actions. Sources told The New York Post that he even went so far as to claim he was working for federal agents.Trump’s presence at Bethpage Black already meant heightened security across the grounds. The president, accompanied by his 18-year-old granddaughter, drew chants of “USA” as he greeted supporters before watching matches from a fortified glass enclosure near the first tee. At one point, he even walked out alongside Bryson DeChambeau to the delight of the pro-American crowd.The measures surrounding Trump’s visit were extensive. Snipers were stationed atop the grandstands, TSA-level checkpoints were set up at multiple entry points, and drones, bomb-sniffing dogs, and chemical detection units were deployed. Even medical staff responding to emergencies faced delays until cleared by authorized personnel. Spectators endured bag checks and bans on electronic devices.Despite these precautions, Eng managed to slip inside. His suspension has raised questions about how he bypassed multiple layers of protection during such a high-security event. The NYPD has yet to release a formal statement on the matter.Also Read: Is Frankie Edgar alright? New Jersey legend suddenly removed from BKFC 82 Newark fight card lineup","Det.

Trump Advisor WARNS NFL and 'Bad Bunny', ICE Will Be at Super Bowl: 'We WILL Deport You'

Bad Bunny’s history of criticizing ICE and the cultural backlash



The NFL faces scrutiny as politics seep into the halftime stage

The NFL ’s decision to tap Bad Bunny as the 2026 Super Bowl halftime performer has sparked a fiery political clash. Longtime Trump adviser Corey Lewandowski claimed this week that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents will be on-site at the major event, signaling a stark intersection between entertainment, politics, and immigration enforcement.Speaking on The Benny Show, Lewandowski issued a blunt warning: “There is nowhere you can provide safe haven to people who are in this country illegally. Not the Super Bowl and nowhere else. We will find you and apprehend you and put you in a detention facility, and deport you. Know that is a very real situation under this administration, which is contrary to how it used to be.”The statement came just days after the NFL announced Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny as the headliner for the 2026 halftime show, a choice celebrated by his fans but condemned by critics. Lewandowski further attacked the league’s decision, saying: “It’s so shameful they’ve decided to pick somebody who seems to hate America so much to represent them at the halftime show. We should be trying to be inclusive, not exclusive. ”Bad Bunny has long been outspoken about ICE raids, once admitting in an i-D interview that he avoided scheduling U.S. tour dates because of fears fans could be detained. “But there was the issue of — like, f—ing ICE could be outside [my concert].And it’s something that we were talking about and very concerned about,” he said.The three-time Grammy winner’s political activism has made him a polarizing figure. To some, he represents the voice of Latino youth and marginalized communities. To others, including Lewandowski, his criticisms of U.S. immigration policy are seen as unpatriotic.The controversy underscores how the Super Bowl halftime stage—traditionally a showcase for global entertainment—has become increasingly politicized. For the NFL, which has weathered past storms over anthem protests and player activism, this decision places the league at the center of yet another culture war.As Lewandowski concluded: “If there are illegal aliens, I don’t care if it’s a concert for Johnny Smith or Bad Bunny or anybody else. We’re going to do enforcement everywhere. We are going to make Americans safe. That is a directive from the president.”Also Read: “Bad Bunny was a woman”: Emmanuel Acho blasts NFL for ‘ridiculous’ choice of Bad Bunny as 2026 Super Bowl halftime star Whether the NFL anticipated this level of political backlash or not, the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show has already become one of the most polarizing in recent memory—long before the first note has been played.","Corey Lewandowski warned ICE agents would be on-site, targeting undocumented immigrants.

GURDASPUR: A disturbing incident has emerged from Kothe village in Gurdaspur district, where a woman was caught on camera brutally assaulting her elderly mother-in-law.In a video lasting nearly one minute, which has gone viral on social media, the daughter-in-law is seen pulling the victim’s hair, slapping her repeatedly, and striking her with steel glasses.The assault reportedly took place in the presence of the victim’s grandson, who recorded the entire episode on his phone.Though he can be heard asking his mother to stop, (Mumma, please stop), he made no attempt to intervene or protect his grandmother.The footage shows the elderly woman gasping for breath as the daughter-in-law violently shakes her and pushes her by the neck.Police sources identified the daughter-in-law as Harjeet Kaur and the mother-in-law as Gurbhajan Kaur. The incident is said to have been triggered by a property dispute.Despite the mother-in-law’s visible distress, the daughter-in-law continued the assault, using abusive language and slurs. At one point, she attempted to strike the woman with her own slippers.Taking suo motu notice of the video, Raj Gill, Chairperson of the Punjab State Commission for Women, on 1 October directed the Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP), Gurdaspur, to initiate an investigation through a senior officer and submit a detailed report within a day.In a post on X, Raj Gill said: “An old, helpless mother was beaten by her daughter-in-law in Gurdaspur. Suo motu action has been issued immediately and strict action will be taken. The safety, rights, and protection of elders is the Commission’s priority.”While the police have launched a preliminary investigation and confirmed that the video will be treated as key evidence, a senior officer of Gurdaspur police—who declined to be named, citing that it is a “Commission matter”—said that police visited the women’s house, but the mother-in-law refused to give a statement, saying it was a family matter and that the dispute had been resolved internally.Family members also refrained from engaging with the media.","A woman was caught on camera brutally assaulting her elderly mother-in-law.

GUWAHATI: Zubeen Garg — the soul of Assam’s cultural rhythm — has always been more than just a musical icon. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Zubeen had become a beacon of hope for many, extending his compassion beyond the stage to the lives of the underprivileged.Among his many acts of kindness, what stood out was his adoption of 15 children from disadvantaged backgrounds, whom he lovingly called his own even though he did not have a biological child. Among them was a young girl, a survivor of child labour and sexual abuse, whom Zubeen not only rescued from a traumatic environment in 2014, but also nurtured her with care and dignity. Over the years, she found stability, got married and became a mother. To help her build a future, Zubeen gifted her a sewing machine — a simple yet powerful tool to earn a livelihood and reclaim her independence — about two years ago.Zubeen’s cousin brother Ritu Prayag Garg said there was no documentation regarding the late singer’s philanthropic acts. “In his entire life, he helped numerous people. People often came to meet him seeking financial help for medical treatment or educational purposes.Such instances are uncountable. Probably, it was one of the reasons as to why people showered him with so much love both before and after his death,” he said.Zubeen had also taken the responsibility of a girl at Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport. “We also do not know properly about many things. He always did what his mind said,” Ritu said.Meanwhile, percussionist Raja Baruah, who played in Zubeen’s band for several years, said that the late musician was not merely a singer. “He believed in humanity. He helped thousands of people in many ways,” Baruah said.Arun Garg, who joined Zubeen’s sister Palme Borthakur while lighting the pyre on September 23, is another example of how Zubeen contributed to others’ lives. Arun’s original name is Arun Sachani, son of a tea-tribe family in Charaideo. He stayed at Zubeen’s residence from around 2016-17 and helped with other works. “He later became Zubeen’s trustworthy and Zubeen offered his title to Arun. He got his new identity as Arun Garg,” said a family member.","Zubeen Garg, the soul of Assam’s cultural rhythm, has always been more than just a musical icon.

CHANDIGARH: To inspire patriotism and encourage students to aspire for a career in the armed forces, Punjab school education minister Harjot Singh Bains on Wednesday requested the Indian Air Force to station five recently retired MiG-21 aircraft at prominent Schools of Eminence of the state.In a letter to Air Chief Marshal Amar Preet Singh, Bains wrote, ""Together, we can create a living tribute to the MiG-21 and ignite the spirit of service and patriotism in future generations.""He proposed five locations for the display of retired MiG-21 fighter jets — Ludhiana, Amritsar, Ferozepur, Nangal, and Kharar.He said this initiative aims to inspire thousands of state govt school students to pursue careers in defence, engineering, aerospace technology, and related fields.Bains said Punjab govt planned to collaborate with IAF for ceremonial deployment events at these schools.Saluting the Indian Air Force (IAF), Bains extended warm congratulations on the recent ceremonial retirement of the warbird, recognising it as an icon of courage, discipline, and dedication in India's defence history.

What programs and payments will stop during US government shutdown





The US government has officially shut down for the first time in six years after a deadlocked Congress failed to pass a funding measure. The full shutdown began at midnight Wednesday, September 30, after Democratic and Republican leaders failed to agree on even a short-term deal to keep the government fully funded past the current fiscal year. So far, it is unclear how long the shutdown will last, or how widespread its impact will be.A key sticking point behind the stalemate is said to be Democrats’ insistence on including the extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits in any stopgap funding bill. Republicans have claimed that Democrats are pushing to provide government benefits to undocumented immigrants. Republicans claim that Democrats want to give health care to ""illegal immigrants."" Democrats say that they are only trying to restore health care coverage options that were available to immigrants having “lawful presence” in the United States before those options were eliminated by President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful” tax bill this year.While so far Elon Musk has not directly commented on the US government shutdown, he has shared/reposted several tweets that support Republican's claim that Democrats want to give health care benefits to ""illegal immigrants”. He quoted VP JD Vance's post on Chuck Schumer rewarding illegal immigrants, and wrote, ""Once Chuck realized that importing voters was a surefire way for Dems to win elections and create a permanent one-party state in America (just like happened in California and New York), he became very much in favor of bribing illegals to come to America!""In his post, JD Vance wrote, ""Chuck Schumer once recognized that it was disastrous to give illegal aliens rewards for breaking the law.Now he wants to shut down the government unless we…reward illegal aliens for breaking the law. x.com/westernlensman…""Elon Musk also shared a Twitter post of White House deputy chief of Staff for Policy and Homeland Security Advisor Stephen Miller that says, ""First shutdown in world history to demand free healthcare for illegal aliens.""""In 2019, every Democrat presidential candidate rose their hand in support for healthcare for illegal aliens. Today, Democrats are willing to shut down the government over free healthcare for illegals. Democrats have always put illegals before Americans,"" reads another Tweet reposted by Elon Musk.The American federal government has either shut down or experienced funding gaps 14 times since 1980. The longest shutdown on record occurred in late 2018 and early 2019, lasting 35 days. That partial shutdown was a result of a stalemate over President Donald Trump’s demand for funding for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.While every government shutdown is unique, they all operate under the same basic principles: non-essential services cease, and many federal employees are furloughed without pay. However, agencies deemed critical for the ""protection of lives and property"" remain operational. These ""essential"" employees, who include air traffic controllers, law enforcement agents, and active-duty military personnel, are required to work but do not receive their paychecks until funding is restored.However, OMB this time is said to be not posting agencies’ shutdown contingency plans on its website. Instead, the plans are hosted only on each agency’s site. This is reported to have made it harder to assess how the Trump administration will handle the shutdown and which activities it will deem essential.","The US government has officially shut down for the first time in six years after a deadlocked Congress failed to pass a funding measure.

The suspects were seen arriving in a white SUV, while security footage also captured a grey SUV circling the lot several times earlier in the night.Police described one suspect as white, wearing black trousers, a hoodie, dark high-top shoes, gloves and a medical mask. The second was also dressed in black, but with white socks and sandals, and was carrying a phone.A week later, at around 1:50 a.m. on 2 October, another suspect approached the front entrance and fired several rounds through the doors before fleeing. Investigators said the gunman had dark skin, a heavy build, and was dressed in black with his face covered. No one was inside the cinema during either attack and no injuries were reported.“These are targeted incidents,” Halton police said in a statement, urging anyone with information to contact investigators or Crime Stoppers.Knoll called the violence “cowardly acts” and said the cinema would continue to co-operate fully with police. “We remain open for business and will fully co-operate with and assist law enforcement in retrieving any information about the perpetrator and conspirator and bringing them to justice — because this just cannot stand.”","Film.Ca Cinemas in Oakville, Ontario, has cancelled screenings of Indian films after two violent attacks on its premises in the past week.

Germany's Munich Airport was forced into an unusual shutdown late on Thursday night after multiple drone sightings disrupted operations, grounding flights and diverting others in what has become a recurring challenge for European aviation hubs.""When a drone is sighted, the safety of travelers is the top priority,"" the airport said in the statement.The airport said in a statement that 17 flights were grounded shortly after 10 pm local time, affecting nearly 3,000 passengers. Another 15 incoming flights were diverted to Stuttgart, Nuremberg, Vienna and Frankfurt.The incident follows similar disruptions last week when drone sightings led to temporary shutdowns at airports in Denmark and Norway.Munich had already been on alert earlier in the week when its Oktoberfest festival was briefly shut after a bomb threat and explosives were found in a residential building in the northern part of the city.Located in Bavaria, southern Germany, Munich Airport is a hub for Lufthansa and handled nearly 20 million passengers in the first half of this year.Denmark has not directly named who it thinks is behind the drone activity in its airspace last week, which caused major disruption at several airports.But Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said, ""we can at least conclude that there is primarily one country that poses a threat to Europe’s security – and that is Russia.”Europe has been on alert in recent weeks over repeated drone sightings and alleged Russian drone incursions into NATO airspace in Poland and Romania, along with claims of Estonian airspace being violated by Russian fighter jets.On Wednesday, European Union leaders supported new plans to strengthen the bloc’s defences against Russian drones.Russian President Vladimir Putin, speaking on Thursday, joked that he would not fly drones over Denmark anymore. Moscow, however, has denied involvement in the incidents.","Munich Airport forced into unusual shutdown late on Thursday night after multiple drone sightings disrupted operations. 17 flights were grounded shortly after 10 pm local time, affecting nearly 3,000 passengers.

TIRUPATI: About two persons were killed and close to 80 others were wounded at the Banni stick festival at Devaragattu in Holagunda mandal in Kurnool district around midnight on Thursday and in the early hours on Friday.The condition of five injured among the 80 wounded persons is said to be critical and all the injured were rushed to the govt hospitals at Alur and Adoni by the district police wing.The Banni festival is celebrated on the night of Vijaya Dasami festival every year to celebrate the victory of Lord Mala Malleswara Swamy and Goddess Parvati Devi over demons Mani and Mallasura who used to trouble noble men and saints at the Devaragattu region.Keeping the ancient traditions alive, Kalyanotsavam fete was held past midnight on Thursday and the idols were taken out in a procession atop the Aswa Vahanam by thousands of devotees hailing from Neraniki, Neraniki Thanda and Kothapeta villages.Meanwhile, the rival group of devotees from Aluru, Sullivan, Yellarthi, Arizona and Netravatti villages joined hands together to hijack the prpcessional deities in a bid to divert the procession to their own villages, which according to them is considered auspicious for the whole village.As the procession surged forward from Rakshapadi, the two groups of villagers armed with flaming torches, long sticks, metal ringed clubs etc, clashed with one another in a fierce battle, in a bid to take control of the procession.Later, the processional deities were taken to Padalakatta on Friday morning and the temple priest slit his thigh with a knife and offered blood to Lord Mala Malleswara Swamy.On reaching Sri Baaveswara temple, the priest who stood under the Banni tree foretold the future and predicted the prices of various crops grown in the region including cotton, Johar, coriander etc.Finally, the Lord's procession reached the Simhasana katta, where the priests performed special rituals, marking the conclusion of this year's Banni festival.While three deaths were reported at the Banni festival in 2023, about 70 persons were injured in last year’s Banni festival and bloodshed continued yet again this year with two reported dead and more than 80 persons injured despite the Kurnool district police wing deploying 800 plus police personnel and stepping up CCTV and drone linked surveillance.",The Banni festival is celebrated on the night of Vijaya Dasami festival every year to celebrate the victory of Lord Mala Malleswara Swamy and Goddess Parvati Devi.

US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has alleged that high-profile associates of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were actively involved in Epstein's illicit activities and may have been blackmailed with compromising videos.Speaking on the New York Post's Miranda Divine Pod Force One podcast on Wednesday whether high-profile associates of Epstein knew of his behavior and just ignored it, Lutnick stated, ""No, they participated. They participated That's what his MO was -- 'Get a massage, get a massage.'""Lutnick further claimed, ""And what happened in that massage room, I assume, was on video. This guy was the greatest blackmailer ever.""He suggested that Epstein may have exchanged blackmail material for a reduced prison sentence in the ""sweetheart deal"" Epstein received during his 2008 state charges.""I assume, way back when, they traded those videos in exchange for him getting that 18-month sentence, which allowed him to have visits and be out of jail. I mean, he's a serial sex offender. How could he get 18 months and be able to go to his office during the day and have visitors and stuff? There must have been a trade,"" Lutnick added.These allegations contrast with statements made by FBI Director Kash Patel, who, during testimony before Congress last month, responded to Senator John Kennedy's inquiry about whether Epstein trafficked young women to others besides himself by saying, ""Himself. There is no credible information. None. If there were, I would bring the case yesterday that he trafficked to other individuals.""Meanwhile, the Trump administration has faced criticism for its decision not to release materials pertaining to the Epstein investigation. In July, following backlash from MAGA supporters, the administration announced that no additional files would be made public.President Donald Trump, who was friends with Epstein in the 1990s before their falling out, dismissed calls to release the files as a ""hoax"" orchestrated by his political adversaries.""It's all been a big hoax,"" Trump told reporters in July. ""It's perpetrated by the Democrats and some stupid Republicans, and foolish Republicans fall into the net. And so they try and do the Democrats' work."" In the same interview, Lutnick described Epstein as ""gross."" ""I say to him, 'Massage table in the middle of your house? How often do you have a massage?'"" Lutnick recounted. ""And he says, 'Every day.' And then he gets, like, weirdly close to me, and he says, 'And the right kind of massage.'""","US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has alleged that high-profile associates of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were actively involved in Epstein's illicit activities.

‘New level of escalation’: Putin warns Trump on sending Tomahawks to Ukraine; US plans may be unfeasible due to limited inventories,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/new-level-of-escalation-putin-warns-trump-on-sending-tomahawks-to-ukraine-us-plans-may-be-unfeasible-due-to-limited-inventories/articleshow/124281076.cms,"



Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned that supplying US Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine could trigger a “whole new level of escalation”, including in relations between Moscow and Washington.Speaking at a forum in Sochi, Putin said that it would not alter the situation on the battlefield, where the Russian army is making slow but steady advances.""Using Tomahawks without the direct participation of American military personnel is impossible. This would mark a completely new, qualitatively new stage of escalation, including in relations between Russia and the United States,"" Putin said at the forum.However, few hours after Putin's warning, Reuters reported that the Trump administration’s plan to send Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine may be unfeasible because current inventories are committed to the US navy and other uses.A US official told Reuters that there was no shortage of the Tomahawk missile, which the military frequently uses for land attack missions, suggesting that alternative shorter-distance weapons could be provided to Kyiv.The official added that the US may consider allowing European allies to purchase other long-range weapons and supply them to Ukraine, but Tomahawks were unlikely.In recent weeks, President Donald Trump has significantly shifted his rhetoric regarding the war in Ukraine, suggesting Kyiv could retake all the land Russia has seized and describing the Russian military as a ""paper tiger.""One tangible outcome of this new stance is the US decision to assist Ukraine in targeting Russian energy infrastructure. A new financial mechanism, the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL), has been developed by the US and its allies to supply Ukraine with new weapons and those from US stocks using funds from Nato countries.Supplying Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine could significantly expand its strike capabilities, enabling it to hit targets deep inside Russian territory, including military bases, logistics hubs, airfields, and command centres that are currently beyond reach.The Kremlin said on Thursday that if the US provides Tomahawks to Ukraine, it would trigger a new round of dangerous escalation between Russia and the West.According to Pentagon budget documents, the US Navy, the primary user of the Tomahawk, has thus far purchased 8,959 missiles at an average price of Rs 10.8 crore each. The Tomahawk missile has been in production since the mid-1980s. In recent years, production has ranged from 55 to 90 per year. According to Pentagon budget data, the US plans to buy 57 missiles in 2026.","Vladimir Putin said supplying Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine could trigger a ‘whole new level of escalation’ Putin said that it would not alter the situation on the battlefield, where the Russian army is making slow but steady advances.

Russian President Vladimir Putin fired back on Thursday at US President Donald Trump for calling Russia a “paper tiger,” suggesting that Nato itself might fit that description.Speaking at the Valdai Discussion Group in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, Putin stated that Russian forces were advancing along the entire front in Ukraine and that nearly the entire US-led Nato alliance was now opposing Russia.""A paper tiger. What follows then? Go and deal with this paper tiger. Well if we are fighting with the entire Nato bloc, we are moving, advancing, and we feel confident, and we are a paper tiger, then what is Nato itself?"" Putin said.Trump, who had previously suggested that Kyiv should cede territory to achieve peace with Moscow, changed his stance sharply last week. He expressed confidence that Ukraine could reclaim all its territory from Russia and referred to Moscow as a ""paper tiger,"" a statement he reiterated this week.Russia's war in Ukraine, Europe's deadliest conflict since World War Two, has escalated into the most significant confrontation between Russia and the West since the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.Russian officials have declared that they are now engaged in a ""hot"" conflict with the West.At the forum, Putin also addressed the reports over US supplying Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine. He said, ""It is impossible to use Tomahawks without the direct participation of American military personnel.""""This will mean a completely new, qualitatively new stage of escalation, including in relations between Russia and the United States.""However, Reuters reported that the Trump administration’s plan to send Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine may be unfeasible because current inventories are committed to the US navy and other uses.In a stern message to Nato, Putin asserted that member countries were supplying Ukraine with intelligence, weapons, and training, and were stirring up hysteria about alleged Russian plans to attack a Nato member—claims he dismissed as ""impossible to believe."" He added, ""If anyone still has a desire to compete with us in the military sphere, as we say, feel free, let them try. Russia's countermeasures will not be long in coming. ""","Vladimir Putin says US-led Nato alliance is opposing Russia in Ukraine.

The Trump administration has approved $230 million in aid for Lebanon’s security forces this week, aiming to support efforts to disarm the formerly powerful group Hezbollah , as per Reuters.A Lebanese source familiar with the decision told Reuters that the package allocates $190 million to the Lebanese Armed Forces and $40 million to the Internal Security Forces.Democratic US congressional aides said the funds were released just before the end of Washington’s fiscal year on September 30. “For a small country like Lebanon, that's really, really significant,” one aide said.The aid was approved amid Trump’s broader cuts to foreign assistance programs, reflecting his administration’s stated priority of putting “America First” in the allocation of taxpayer dollars.A State Department spokesperson said in an email that US aid supports Lebanese forces ""as they work to assert Lebanese sovereignty across the country and fully implement UN Security Council Resolution 1701, the only viable framework for a durable security arrangement for both Lebanese and Israelis.""Hezbollah has resisted calls to disarm since its devastating war with Israel, yet the group faces mounting pressure from both rival Lebanese factions and Washington to relinquish its weapons.President Joseph Aoun and Prime Minister Nawaf Salam on August 5, directed the US-backed army to develop a plan to ensure that all weapons across the country would be under the control of security forces by year’s end.The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah erupted after the group launched rockets at northern Israel in support of Hamas, following the October 7 attack in southern Israel that left around 1,200 people dead and 251 taken hostage to Gaza.The resolution, adopted in August 2006, ended the previous deadly conflict between Hezbollah and Israel. Meanwhile, a more recent conflict between Israel and Lebanon, which began a year ago, has severely weakened Hezbollah and left large parts of Lebanon in devastation.By September 2024, the situation had escalated into a full-scale war between Israel and Hezbollah, which continued until November.","The aid was approved amid Trump’s broader cuts to foreign assistance programs, reflecting his stated priority of putting “America First” in the allocation of taxpayer dollars.

US President Donald Trump has declared that the United States is in a formal ""armed conflict"" with drug cartels designated as terrorist organizations, and that suspected smugglers for these groups should be considered ""unlawful combatants,"" as per a confidential notice sent to Congress this week.The notice, sent to multiple congressional committees, provides further detail on the administration’s previously limited legal justification for three US military strikes last month on boats in the Caribbean Sea. These attacks, which killed all 17 people on board, are argued by the administration to be lawful rather than murder, as reported by the New York Times.Under international law, a country engaged in an armed conflict can legally kill enemy combatants even if they do not pose an immediate threat, detain them indefinitely without trial, and try them in military courts.White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly stated that Trump is following through on his commitment to combat drug cartels.“As we have said many times, the President acted in line with the law of armed conflict to protect our country from those trying to bring deadly poison to our shores, and he is delivering on his promise to take on the cartels and eliminate these national security threats from murdering more Americans,"" Kelly was quoted as saying by ABC News.The memo states that Trump has ""determined"" that cartels involved in drug smuggling are ""nonstate armed groups"" whose activities ""constitute an armed attack against the United States.""The notice to Congress did not identify any specific drug cartels involved in the alleged armed conflict, nor did it clarify the criteria the administration uses to determine whether individual suspects are sufficiently connected to these groups to justify military action.The memo refers to a September 15 incident in which three people were killed on an alleged Venezuelan vessel, asserting that US actions in striking the boat were consistent with the law of armed conflict.""The vessel was assessed by the US intelligence community to be affiliated with a designated terrorist organization and, at the time, engaged in trafficking illicit drugs, which could ultimately be used to kill Americans,"" the memo stated.It added that, although the strike was limited in scope, US forces remain prepared to continue military operations ""as necessary"" to prevent further deaths or injuries to Americans by eliminating the threat ""posed by these designated terrorist organizations.""US officials have long argued that Venezuelan cocaine shipments fuel overdose deaths in the country and accuse President Nicolás Maduro of enabling drug trafficking, a charge he denies. The Trump administration has also offered a $50 million bounty for his capture.","US President Donald Trump has declared that the United States is in a formal ""armed conflict"" with drug cartels designated as terrorist organizations.

Munich Airport in Germany was forced to temporarily close early Friday local time following multiple drone sightings, officials confirmed.The disruption grounded 17 flights, affecting nearly 3,000 passengers, the airport said in an official statement, according to the CNN.In addition, 15 inbound flights were redirected to other German cities, including Stuttgart, Nuremberg, and Frankfurt, as well as Vienna in Austria, the airport said.Munich Airport, located in Bavaria in southern Germany, handled nearly 20 million passengers in the first half of 2025.The closure adds Munich to a growing list of European airports disrupted by drone sightings.A call handler fielding passenger enquiries for Munich Airport told CNN: “Some flights are still waiting to take off, others have been canceled. Everything is under control and the airport is due to reopen at 5 a.m.”The airport, a hub for German flag-carrier Lufthansa, served nearly 20 million passengers in the first half of this year. It became the latest European airport to close following drone sightings.Last week, a series of sightings over several airports in Denmark affected tens of thousands of passengers. Denmark subsequently banned all civil drone flights in its airspace as it prepared to host a summit of European leaders in Copenhagen to discuss support for Ukraine in its fight against Russia and bolstering European security.Europe has been on high alert in recent weeks due to multiple drone sightings, as well as alleged incursions by Russian drones into NATO airspace over Poland and Romania, and the alleged violation of Estonian airspace by Russian fighter jets.Munich, a historic city of more than one million people, was already on edge after its famed Oktoberfest beer festival was closed for several hours earlier this week due to a bomb threat.","Munich Airport in Germany was forced to temporarily close early Friday local time following multiple drone sightings.

Why is Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst significant?







A lockdown at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst (JBMDL) in Burlington County, New Jersey, was lifted around noon on Tuesday after a hoax shooter threat.A lockdown was imposed just before 11 am ET, which lasted approximately one hour following a report of an active shooter at the major US military installation. However, authorities later determined there was no active shooter threat.Base officials an hour later confirmed in a Facebook post stating, “ALL CLEAR. All personnel are to resume normal operations.” The lockdown had been ordered just before 11 am, with an earlier advisory urging personnel outdoors to take cover.“Our priority is the safety and security of everyone on the installation,” Col. Michael Stefanovic, JBMDL commander, said in a statement. “We worked closely with local law enforcement and emergency responders to ensure the situation was investigated and resolved as quickly as possible.”Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, located in central New Jersey, is a key tri-service US military installation, formed in 2009 through the merger of McGuire Air Force Base, Fort Dix, and Naval Air Engineering Station Lakehurst. Spanning over 42,000 acres across Burlington and Ocean counties, the base supports air mobility, training, and engineering operations critical to national defense.The installation is home to more than 40 units and mission partners, including the Air Force’s 305th Air Mobility Wing, Army Reserve and Guard units, and Navy test and evaluation programs. Its strategic location allows for rapid global deployment of personnel and equipment, while also serving as a central training hub for service members."," lockdown at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst lifted after hoax shooter threat. lockdown was imposed just before 11 am ET, which lasted approximately one hour.

Although unusual for a defendant to appear remotely without video, the court confirmed that the arrangement was requested by the defense, FOX News reported.During the hearing, Robinson and his newly appointed legal counsel indicated their intention to pursue a preliminary hearing, where a judge will decide whether sufficient evidence exists to move forward with a trial.Lead defense attorney Kathy Nester, along with two newly added lawyers, Michael N. Burt and Richard G. Novak from California, asked the court for more time to determine whether an evidentiary hearing would be necessary. “Until we can kinda get our heads around exactly what we're dealing with and how much we need to process, it's going to be difficult for us to give you a reasonable expectation of when we will be ready to do the prelim,” Nester told Judge Tony Graf Jr.The judge fixed the next hearing date on October 30 in an open-to-the-public hearing.Judge Tony Graf, who is overseeing the proceedings, asked Nester if she planned to have Robinson attend in person next month.

US government shutdown: Education dept employees' out-of-office emails altered to blame Democrats; claim 'none of us contested',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-government-shutdown-education-dept-employees-out-of-office-emails-altered-to-blame-democrats-claim-none-of-us-contested/articleshow/124280514.cms,"



While the US government has already been shut down, some of the employees of the education department discovered their email accounts had been manipulated during their furlough this week.Five employees of the education department discovered that while they were out of the office, they had included partisan talking points that blamed the government shutdown on Democrats.The employees, who spoke with NBC News and provided copies of their out-of-office messages, reported that the wording had been altered from their original compositions. All are civil servants, not political appointees, and requested anonymity out of fear of professional repercussions.Initially, Education officials sent employees templates of nonpartisan out-of-office messages to use in their emails. Several employees stated they used this language earlier in the week, only to find that while they were furloughed, someone had changed it.“We’re looking to hear from federal government workers. If you’re willing to talk with us, please email us at tips@nbcuni.com or contact us through one of these methods,” one employee said.And now the altered email messages included statements such as: “Thank you for contacting me. On September 10-2025, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 5371, a clean continuing resolution. Unfortunately, Democrat Senators are blocking passage of H.R. 5371 in the Senate which has led to a lapse in appropriations. Due to the lapse of appropriations, I am currently in furlough status. I will respond to emails once government functions resume.”One individual reported changing the out-of-office message back to the nonpartisan version, only to have it revert to the partisan wording later.“None of us consented to this. And it’s written in the first person, as if I’m the one conveying this message, and I’m not. I don’t agree with it. I don’t think it’s ethical or legal. I think it violates the Hatch Act,” the employee stated, referring to the law that limits federal employees’ political activity.Another employee explained, “I took the statement that they sent us earlier in the week to use. And I pasted it on top of that — basically has a standard out-of-office. They went in and manipulated my out-of-office reply. I guess they’re now making us all guilty of violating the Hatch Act.”On Wednesday, NBC News reported that some employees at federal agencies were being offered partisan language blaming Democrats for the shutdown to use as their out-of-office messages. Additionally, several federal websites now display language targeting Democrats or the “radical left.” The Education Department’s actions have been criticised for involving individual civil servants in political messaging regardless of their personal views.Madi Biedermann, the deputy assistant secretary for communications, responded: “The email reminds those who reach out to Department of Education employees that we cannot respond because Senate Democrats are refusing to vote for a clean CR and fund the government. Where’s the lie?”One employee expressed frustration over the lack of accountability, stating, “Nobody follows the law anymore, so why does it matter? It seems like laws are dotted lines now, not solid lines. It seems there’s no one to hold this administration accountable to laws.” Regarding potential repercussions, the employee added, “Clearly, this wasn’t done by me; it was done while I was in a furlough status. I think I’d be able to argue that point. ”","Five employees of the education department discovered that while they were out of the office, they had included partisan talking points that blamed the government shutdown on Democrats.

'U.S. Govt Broke, Surviving On Borrowed Money': Trump Ally Scott Perry Truth Bomb Before Congress





US President Donald Trump has launched an unprecedented move targeting top American universities, offering them federal funding in return for promoting conservative ideas on their campuses.The initiative, conveyed through a 10-point “compact,” was sent out from the White House on Wednesday, called “Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education” was reported by Wall Street Journal.Under the deal, universities that sign on are promised “multiple positive benefits,” including “substantial and meaningful federal grants.” In exchange, they must ensure a “vibrant marketplace of ideas on campus,” elevate the profile of conservative viewpoints, and eliminate academic departments that “purposefully punish, belittle, and even spark violence against conservative ideas.”Other key stipulations of the compact include banning race or sex as factors in student admissions and hiring, freezing tuition fees for five years, and capping international undergraduate students at 15%. This includes promoting a wide range of views and “transforming or abolishing institutional units that purposefully punish, belittle, and even spark violence against conservative ideas,"" according to the compact.Each university would also have to commission an annual poll of students and faculty to evaluate adherence to the pact.Although only nine universities have been formally approached with the compact, the memorandum carries an implicit warning to all federally funded institutions. It states that while “institutions of higher education are free to develop models and values other than those” in the memo, this comes at the cost of losing all federal funding streams.The terms would be enforced by the Justice Department, with violators losing access to the compact’s benefits for no less than a year. Repeated violations would trigger a two-year penalty.The nine universities named in the initiative are Vanderbilt University, Dartmouth College, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Southern California, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Arizona, Brown University, and the University of Virginia.The Trump administration has leveraged its control over federal funding at several other universities, including Harvard and Columbia, by withholding research grants while pushing for changes to their governance and policies.","The initiative, conveyed through a 10-point ‘compact,’ was sent out from the White House on Wednesday.

Pak Parliamentarian Mocks Army Chief Munir As ‘Salesman’, PM Sharif As ‘Manager’ Over Trump Meeting





The Commonwealth Observer Group (COG) has officially released its report on Pakistan’s 2024 general elections, noting “conditions that appeared to impact one party’s ability to fairly contest the election” — namely the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), led by incarcerated former Prime Minister Imran Khan The report, which included a ""Letter of Transmittal"" by COG chairperson and former Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, cited the denial to PTI of its election symbol, Khan’s consecutive convictions ahead of polling, and restrictions on freedom of association and assembly.Jonathan wrote: “When looked at in isolation, some – though not all – of the arguments advanced by key institutions in support of their actions appear somewhat justifiable. Yet, collectively, it could not go unnoticed that these decisions consistently limited one party's ability to contest the election on a level playing field.”The observers expressed particular concern over the Supreme Court of Pakistan’s revocation of PTI’s iconic “bat” symbol — linked to Khan’s cricketing past — on grounds that the party failed to hold intra-party elections. With the decision coming just weeks before polling, PTI candidates were forced to run as independents, depriving them of a unifying symbol.The group also flagged Khan’s multiple convictions shortly before polling day, along with restrictions on PTI’s rallies and gatherings. “There were also limitations on fundamental political rights, including freedom of association and assembly. These limitations were felt most acutely by PTI and its supporters,” the report said.The COG called for reforms to strengthen transparency and ensure a level playing field for all parties in future Pakistani elections.The report found that mainstream English-language media “broadly followed the principles of fair and accurate election reporting,” though PTI-affiliated independent candidates received ""less positive"" coverage.By contrast, state-owned PTV News lacked balance, focusing mainly on the ruling PML-N and PPP, and reportedly barred references to Khan by name. The group concluded that these factors may have “impinged on the credibility, transparency and inclusiveness of the electoral process.”The report had been controversial after media reports suggested the Commonwealth had “buried” it following widespread problems in the February 8 polls. Submitted to the Commonwealth secretary-general on November 20, 2024, the publication was delayed without explanation.The PTI had repeatedly demanded its release, arguing it confirmed “systemic rigging, institutional bias, and deliberate targeting” of the party and its founder.","Commonwealth Observer Group releases report on Pakistan's 2024 general elections.

Israel-Hamas peace plan: Pakistan sending troops to Gaza?

Trump's 20-point peace plan







Pakistan’s top leadership may send troops to Gaza as part of a Muslim nations’ peacekeeping force under a comprehensive peace deal announced by US President Donald Trump.The decision was announced by Pakistan’s foreign minister Ishaq Dar on Tuesday.At a press conference in Islamabad, Dar was asked directly about Pakistan’s role in the initiative, which aims to end the bloodshed in Gaza. “The force [here] is a peacekeeping force. On the ground, there will be Palestinian law-enforcement agencies... there will be [separate] forces supporting them. Indonesia has offered 20,000 troops for that. I am sure Pakistan's leadership will also be making a decision on this,” he said.Dar explained that the idea was to set up an independent Palestinian government of technocrats overseen by an international body. He said Pakistan had asked for the arrangements to be documented at the UN Security Council.He shared that a preparatory meeting of leaders from eight Muslim countries with US President Trump was held in New York last week on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. “The objectives were to try for a ceasefire in Gaza, make arrangements for sending humanitarian aid, stop the forced displacement of Palestinians and make arrangements for the return of the displaced Gazans,” he said.Dar added that the plan also included Gaza’s reconstruction and halting Israel’s efforts to annex the West Bank. According to him, Trump proposed that his team work with the foreign ministers of the Muslim nations to create a “workable solution.”The foreign minister said Saudi Arabia had reached out to Pakistan with a draft joint statement on the plan, which was later revised after his input. He noted that the Palestinian Authority welcomed the statement.On Monday, Donald Trump unveiled a 20-point peace plan aimed at ending the Gaza war by demanding Hamas’s disarmament, the immediate release of all hostages within 72 hours, and a phased withdrawal of Israeli forces. Under the proposal, Hamas would be excluded from any future governance; militants willing to abandon arms would receive amnesty, while those wishing to leave Gaza would be allowed safe passage. The plan also involves a temporary technocratic Palestinian committee ruling Gaza under oversight by an international “Board of Peace” led by Trump and including Tony Blair, until the Palestinian Authority is reformed.The initiative calls for humanitarian aid to flow into Gaza without interference from either Israel or Hamas, managed by UN agencies and the Red Crescent, with reconstruction under a “New Gaza” framework. Trump gave Hamas three to four days to accept the plan or face what he called “a very sad end.”","Pakistan's top leadership may send troops to Gaza as part of a Muslim nations' peacekeeping force.
