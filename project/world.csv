Lobuche, located near the Khumbu Glacier in Nepal, lies approximately 150 kilometres east of Kathmandu and is close to the Everest Base Camp.China's earthquake monitoring agency recorded the quake's magnitude as 6.8, with the epicentral region at an altitude of about 4,200 metres (13,800 feet), according to Chinese state broadcaster CCTV.Further, as per NCS data, two more earthquakes struck the region later in the morning.One of magnitude 4.7 was recorded at 7:02 AM IST, with its epicenter at latitude 28.60 degrees North and longitude 87.68 degrees East, at a depth of 10 kilometers.Another earthquake of magnitude 4.9 occurred at 7:07 AM IST, with its epicenter at latitude 28.68 degrees North and longitude 87.54 degrees East, at a depth of 30 kilometers.Nepal, according to experts, is exposed to earthquakes as it is in a seismically active zone, which makes quakes inevitable.The last time Nepal felt such a strong earthquake was on April 25, 2015, when a 7.8 magnitude quake killed some 9,000 people, the worst in Nepal's history, and damaged about 1 million structures. The previous deadliest earthquake that struck the region was in 1934 with over 8,000 fatalities.A day earlier, on Monday, an earthquake of magnitude 4.5 hit Afghanistan at 12.47 pm IST, the National Centre of Seismology (NCS) reported.

The theft came to light on December 14, when villagers, on their routine walks, found the transformer missing. It had been stripped of everything that could be sold - copper wires, oil, and other metal segments - and dumped under straw in nearby fields. No replacement has been provided yet.Village head Satpal Singh told TOI, ""Lack of electricity is affecting studies, especially with UP board exams scheduled for next month.

""A supply connection has been arranged from a nearby village to alleviate the problem. Most transformer thefts occur during winter, so we've sought increased patrolling from police. A report has been filed, and we hope that police will solve the case soon,"" Chaudhary said.However, many villagers dispute the claim of an alternate power supply.

The family was from Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh, and was staying in a rented house in Sadashivanagar.On Monday, when a woman employed by the couple to take care of the children came for work, she discovered Anup hanging and raised an alarm. Neighbours rushed in and found the others dead in another room. The woman, Reshma, told police she was asked to come a little early as the family had planned to leave for Puducherry. Police checked Kumar's laptop and mobile phone and found that he had sent an email around midnight to his elder brother Amit.Based on the contents of the mail and the statements of those known to the family, police said Anup's financial troubles began after his maternal uncle Rakesh lured him into investing around Rs 25 lakh on a piece of land in Prayagraj to start a petrol bunk in 2018. The business remained a non-starter and his hard-earned money was stuck.After Anupriya was admitted to a pre-school, the couple got their daughter's medical examination done on teachers' insistence.

It failed because the two did not participate in the visarjan. On Oct 12, Siddique was leaving Zeeshan's office at Nirmal Nagar in Bandra (East) five minutes after his son had left. He was gunned down a little after he stepped outside, near Nirmal Nagar police station.The chargesheet named 26 arrested accused and highlighted the involvement of three absconding suspects, Mohammad Yasin Akhtar alias Sikandar, Shubham Lonkar alias Shubbu and Anmol Singh Bishnoi alias Bhanu.It said Bishnoi masterminded the murder as part of a calculated move to assert dominance, instill fear and expand his extortion racket.The 4,590-page chargesheet, which was submitted by the anti-extortion cell before the special MCOCA court, did not mention jailed gangster Lawrence Bishnoi Police sources said they found no evidence of Lawrence Bishnoi's involvement.

Bijapur maoist attack: How did 70kg IED go undetected? SOP questions swirl around after Maoist attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bijapur-maoist-attack-questions-around-sop-swirl-after-reds-blow-up-convoy/articleshow/117004039.cms,"RAIPUR: Another IED attack. Another homecoming team blown apart. And the same questions.Were standard operating procedures (SOPs) followed? How did a 60-70kg IED go undetected? If a road-opening party had sanitised the route, why didn’t they spot the danger lurking in the bushes? A Maoist IED team would have to be somewhere nearby — within sight of the convoy — to manually trigger the explosion just as the vehicle passed over the spot.These questions are swirling around after the Bijapur blast, just as they did in the aftermath of the IED explosion that killed 10 jawans and their driver in Dantewada in April 2023, and the April 2011 Tekulguda massacre in which 25 security personnel were killed. Even the Dantewada ambush of April 2010, in which 76 policemen were killed, was unleashed on troops returning.The jawans blown up in Bijapur Monday were battle-weary but jubilant, having neutralised five Maoists in a gruelling 2-day operation. Police say a road opening party had checked the route just prior to the convoy’s arrival on that stretch. The vehicle that was targeted was the seventh in a cavalcade of eight vehicles. The jawans would have felt secure in the knowledge that an ROP had gone the same way.Brig Basant Kumar Ponwar (retd), who spent 18 years in Bastar training security personnel at Jungle Warfare College to “fight a guerrilla like a guerrilla”, says the return journey is the most crucial part of the operation. “After victory, lethargy takes over. They can’t let down their guard after initial victory in a war zone, or they become the easiest of targets. The most important aspect is to ensure SOPs are followed. To ensure that the ROP has cleared 50-150 yards on both sides of the road in a ‘V’ formation. Did sniffer dogs track the route? A secure corridor has to be given to vehicles and a mobile patrol is supposed to be there on the axis to monitor movement,” the former Army commando said.As per preliminary probe, the use of light motor vehicles for jawans to return was the first blunder. The second was to assume that Kutru would be a safer route.Apart from this convoy of eight, the other vehicles took other routes through Pamed.Police said two trees, standing on opposite sides of the road, were markers for Maoists for where the IED was buried. Hiding in the trees, a Maoist, posing as a villager, would have triggered the explosion.The IED attack is a wake-up call for security forces and administration.“Regular patrols, clearing the axis and extensive use of tracker dogs has to be ensured. Mining industries have to be given strict instructions that explosives don’t end up in the wrong hands,” asked Brig Ponwar.","Questions are swirling around after the Bijapur blast.

Trudeau Gives Up, Gets Emotional After Resignation As Canada PM; 'I Am A Fighter, I Cannot...'

US President-elect Donald Trump wasted no time responding to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's announcement of his resignation, bringing up his long-standing suggestion that Canada should join the United States as the ""51st state.""In a post on Truth Social, Trump proposed that many Canadians would welcome the idea, citing the economic benefits of merging with the US. ""The United States can no longer suffer the massive trade deficits and subsidies that Canada needs to stay afloat. Justin Trudeau knew this, and resigned,"" Trump wrote. He continued, claiming that such a merger would eliminate tariffs, lower taxes, and ensure Canada’s security against threats from Russia and China. ""Together, what a great nation it would be!!!""This is not the first time Trump has floated the idea of Canada becoming part of the US. During a meeting at his Mar-a-Lago resort with Trudeau, Trump suggested that if Canada's economy were to collapse under US tariffs, it could merge with the US with Trudeau as its ""governor."" Trudeau reportedly responded that such tariffs would harm Canada’s economy.Trump’s comments also revisited his previous suggestions about Canada’s political future, including a December post joking that hockey legend Wayne Gretzky could run for Prime Minister—or even serve as Canada's ""governor."" Trump has long criticized Canada's trade practices, particularly its trade deficit with the U.S. and the country’s handling of migrant issues.The resignation of Trudeau, who has faced months of slumping poll numbers and internal party division, marks the end of his tenure after nearly a decade in power. Trudeau announced he would step down once the Liberal Party selects a new leader, leaving him as a caretaker prime minister until then.While Trump’s suggestion may seem tongue-in-cheek, it reflects a more serious underlying criticism of Canada’s economic policies and the strain in US-Canada relations. Trump had previously threatened a 25% tariff on all Canadian and Mexican imports if they did not take stronger action to curb migration and prevent fentanyl from entering the US. His comments on Trudeau's resignation seem to underline his belief that Canada's economic and political troubles may leave it vulnerable to deeper integration with the US.","US President-elect Donald Trump responded to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's resignation.

""Happy New Year's, I love you,"" were the final words, 21-year-old Hubert Gauthreaux told his sister before he was killed in the terrorist attack in New Orleans.Hubert was among 14 victims celebrating the start of 2025 on Bourbon Street in the city’s historic French Quarter when Shamsud Din Jabbar, a US Army veteran and ISIS recruit, launched a deadly attack.Around 3.15 am, Jabbar drove a pickup truck into a crowd before exiting the vehicle and opening fire on fleeing revelers. Fourteen people were killed, and around 30 others were injured in the attack. Later, the assailant was shot during a firefight with police.Hubert, a resident of Marrero near New Orleans, ventured into the city for New Year celebrations with friends but never returned. His final text with his sister Brooke Gauthreaux, who studies at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, occurred at 12.08am, according to the Daily Mail.She messaged ""Happy new year i love u!!"", to which he replied ""love you too"".Later, Hubert's family visited the incident site, walking together on Bourbon Street with police accompaniment. Brooke, overcome with emotion, broke down during the walk, moving even the accompanying officers to tears.At the memorial site, she said: ""The memory of his love and kindness will remain in our hearts forever. Thank you for your thoughts and prayers."" She portrayed her younger brother as a deeply caring, generous individual who brought happiness to those around him.In the immediate aftermath of the attack, the Hubert family posted frantically on social media about his disappearance, later discovering he had died in hospital.""Missing kid due to the craziness in the FQ! Please BOLO!!!"" read one post, initially hoping he was merely displaced in the chaos. As reality set in, tributes replaced search posts in the period following the suicide attack.Brooke said: ""I woke up yesterday and a piece of me was gone. My sweet, selfless baby brother. You deserved so much better than this"".""Without expecting a random phone call from you just to talk for an hour while you’re driving home, for advice, for you to vent or to get your little shit ass out of trouble. Without asking you for a favor and you dropping everything to help me or coming all the way to and from Lafayette to pick me up or drop me off,"" she said in a Facebook post.""I was looking forward to that 2 and a half hour drive you were gonna take me on tomorrow to get me back home. You are so loved by everyone you’ve touched in this world, she added.Brooke further continued, ""I’m so proud to be your big sister. I’d do anything to go back and be in the bleachers supporting you on the baseball diamond. Back to complaining about driving you and your friends everywhere, but doing it every single time anyway. Nothing feels real anymore. Part of me is just expecting for you to walk through the door with that slick little grin and give me a hug. I miss you so so much already.”The 21-year-old's ex-school, Archbishop Shaw High School stated: ""It is with great sorrow that we share that alum Hubert Gauthreaux, Class of 2021, was tragically killed in the senseless act of violence that occurred early this morning in the French Quarter.""Hubert Gauthreaux’s name was added to a mural on Bourbon Street, created by artist Roberto Marquez, commemorating the 14 victims of the New Orleans truck attack .

""I lost my son. He's a good boy. Unfortunately, his life ended that quick and with no reason. Just nothing he did to deserve for somebody to come and kill him,"" Badawi told of his son to the Associated Press.Nikyra Dedeaux, an 18-year-old from Gulfport, Mississippi, aspired to become a registered nurse, according to her friend Zion Parsons. She was employed at a hospital and was prepared to commence her university studies to pursue her career goals.""She had her mindset - she didn't have everything figured out but she had the plan laid down,"" Parsons said. Parsons, also a Gulfport resident, was enjoying New Year's Eve celebrations on Bourbon Street when a vehicle struck Dedeaux.""A truck hit the corner and came barreling through throwing people like in a movie scene, throwing people into the air.

New Orleans tragedy: Chronology of terror attack that killed 14,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-orleans-tragedy-chronology-of-terror-attack-that-killed-14/articleshow/116989511.cms,"Reports claimed the suspect was identified as 42-year-old Samsud Din Jabbar

Between June 22 and July 3, 2023, Jabbar travelled to Cairo before returning to the United States.

Shortly after, from July 10-13, 2023, he visited Ontario, Canada, before coming back to the U.S.

In autumn 2024, Jabbar began visiting New Orleans.

On October 30, he first arrived in the city. The following day, October 31, the FBI reported he used Meta smart glasses to record himself cycling through the French Quarter whilst planning the attack.

He returned to New Orleans on November 10.

On November 19, Jabbar acquired a semiautomatic rifle through a legitimate private transaction in Arlington, Texas. The seller was unaware of Jabbar's plans.

On December 31, he visited a Texas gun shop and bought an ice chest intended for an improvised explosive device.

The final day of 2024 saw Jabbar enter Louisiana at 2.30 pm.

By 9 pm, his rented F-150 pickup was spotted in Gonzales, Louisiana, approximately 65 miles from New Orleans' French Quarter.

In the early hours of January 1, events unfolded rapidly. At 12.41 am, Jabbar parked and walked to Royal and Governor Nichols Street. At 1.53 am, he placed the first IED at Bourbon and St. Peter streets, though someone uninvolved later moved it to Orleans Street. By 2.20 am, he positioned a second IED at Bourbon and Toulouse streets.

The attack occurred at 3.15 am, when Jabbar drove onto the pavement around a police blockade at Canal Street's entrance to Bourbon Street, striking numerous New Year's celebrants.

After he shot at officers and crowds, police fatally shot him.

At 5.18 am, firefighters responded to a rental property on Mandeville Street where Jabbar had attempted to destroy evidence.

Despite placing accelerants throughout, the fire extinguished itself. Investigators discovered bomb-making materials and what appeared to be a homemade rifle silencer.

Bourbon Street reopened on January 2 at 1 pm. Later on January 4, residents gathered for a memorial service.

New Year’s celebrations in New Orleans turned to tragedy when a truck plowed into a crowd on Bourbon Street in the historic French Quarter. The assailant, Shamsud Din Jabbar , a US Army veteran and ISIS recruit, carried out the deadly attack, killing 14 people and injuring around 30 others.The timeline below outlines the events leading up to and following the New Year's Day vehicle attack, which ended with police fatally shooting Jabbar, at the scene.","Shamsud Din Jabbar, 42, killed 14 people and injured 30 in New Orleans.

US, South Korea condemn missile launch

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has said that the recently tested new hypersonic missile system will help deter rivals in the country's Pacific region. The test coincided with US secretary of state Antony Blinken 's visits to South Korea and Japan. North Korea tested a new hypersonic missile system this week, state media reported Tuesday.“The hypersonic missile system will reliably contain any rivals in the Pacific region that can affect the security of our state,” said Kim, who oversaw the launch, as reported by the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).The missile flew 1,500 kilometers and traveled at 12 times the speed of sound before landing in the ocean, according to Kim. South Korea's military reported a shorter flight distance of 1,100 kilometers. This is North Korea’s first missile test since November, when it launched a solid-fuel ICBM.Kim said the missile launch was for self-defense. ""This is clearly a plan and effort for self-defence, not an offensive plan and action,"" Kim said. Despite claiming defensive intentions, Kim also stressed the missile’s capabilities. ""This missile's performance could not be ignored worldwide,"" he said, adding it could ""deal a serious military strike to a rival while effectively breaking any dense defensive barrier.""Kim confirmed North Korea’s commitment to strengthening its military, saying, ""The development of the defence capabilities of the DPRK aiming to be a military power will be further accelerated.""Photos released by state media showed Kim’s daughter, Ju Ae, observing the launch with him. The exact location of the test remains undisclosed.The test coincided with Blinken's visit to South Korea, a key strategic ally and longstanding rival of the North, with whom it is technically still at war.Blinken and South Korean foreign minister Cho Tae-yul condemned the launch. Blinken stressed the need to strengthen the alliance with Japan and South Korea. He also expressed concerns about increasing cooperation between North Korea and Russia, including on space technology. Blinken voiced worries about Russia potentially recognizing North Korea as a nuclear state.South Korea, the US, and Japan’s nuclear envoys held a call to condemn the launch. Intelligence reports suggest North Korea sent troops to fight in Ukraine and has suffered casualties.","North Korea tested a new hypersonic missile system this week, state media reported Tuesday.

Snow records

Record-low tempratures

Travel disruptions

A polar vortex swept across the United States, affecting regions east of the Rockies with extreme winter weather at the beginning of the week.Heavy snow blanketed cities like Washington , D.C ., and Louisville, Kentucky , while rare freezes hit southern states, including parts of Florida. Ice and wind created treacherous conditions, downing trees and making roads impassable.According to reports by BBC, at least five people died in separate incidents across the United States due to the blast of the winter storm. Virginia State Police responded to over 430 crashes, leaving more than 20 people injured, writes the Associate Press. In Missouri, over 600 motorists were stranded during the weekend, highlighting the severity of the situation.Several states recorded historic snowfall. Topeka, Kansas, saw 14.5 inches (37 cm) of snow, while Kansas City reported 11 inches (28 cm), breaking a record set in 1962. Louisville, Kentucky, recorded 7.7 inches (20 cm), surpassing a 1910 record. Cincinnati, Northern Kentucky Airport faced a similar disruption with 8 inches (20 cm) of snow.Temperatures plunged across the country, with forecasters warning of lows 12 to 25°F (7 to 14°C) below normal. Coastal areas in the Northeast recorded temperatures as low as -15 to -17°C, while the Central Plains endured similarly bone-chilling conditions.The cold weather caused major travel disruptions, with over 9,000 flights cancelled or delayed from Texas to New York, according to Flightaware. Greater Washington, DC, airports were the worst affected, with 80% of departures from National Airport cancelled. The airport closed runways for snow removal, and while terminals remained open, runways were expected to stay closed until Tuesday morning.Highways, including major routes like I-64 and US Route 41, were also shut down due to snow and ice.The polar vortex also left over 300,000 without power in Kentucky, Indiana, Virginia, and West Virginia, and forced schools to close in multiple states, with Maryland declaring a state of emergency and shutting schools and offices.A polar vortex is a large area of cold, rotating air that surrounds both of Earth's polar regions. Usually confined to the Arctic, it occasionally shifts southward, bringing freezing conditions to the US. Studies show that the fast-warming Arctic is partly to blame for the increasing frequency of the polar vortex extending its grip.","Polar vortex swept across the United States, affecting regions east of the Rockies with extreme winter weather at the beginning of the week.

Matthew Heath and Osman Khan, two Americans once imprisoned in Venezuela, have taken legal action against Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro, accusing him of running a state-backed criminal operation.The lawsuit filed in a Miami federal court, claims Maduro’s government systematically uses American citizens as bargaining tools in political negotiations with the United States.According to a report by the Associate Press, the 87-page complaint alleges severe mistreatment of the plaintiffs while in custody. According to Heath and Khan, they endured waterboarding, electric shocks, threats of sexual violence, and forced confinement in a cramped cell known as ""El Tigrito."" Their attorneys argue these acts were part of a broader effort to pressure the US into lifting sanctions, ending an oil embargo, and agreeing to prisoner exchanges.Heath, a former Marine, was detained in 2020 while travelling through Venezuela. Authorities accused him of terrorism, alleging he was spying for then-President Donald Trump. His family maintains that Heath was stranded in the region due to the COVID-19 lockdown and was attempting to reach Aruba to retrieve his boat.Khan, a Florida college graduate, was detained in 2022 while crossing into Venezuela to visit his girlfriend’s family.

Court rejects Trump’s appeal to postpone sentencing in hush-money case ahead of second presidential term,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/court-rejects-trumps-appeal-to-postpone-sentencing-in-hush-money-case-ahead-of-second-presidential-term/articleshow/117006574.cms,"AP photo

A Manhattan judge has denied President-elect Donald Trump’s request to postpone his sentencing in a hush-money case, set for just over a week before his inauguration.Judge Juan Merchan upheld his prior decision despite appeals from Trump’s legal team, rejecting the bid on Monday to delay the high-profile case.Trump, convicted of falsifying business records in 2023, faces sentencing on January 10, 2025, though jail time is unlikely.Trump's legal team argued that his recent electoral victory should warrant a delay, but the court maintained that the proceedings must continue as planned. The sentencing is set for Friday, January 10, just ten days before Trump’s inauguration as the 47th president of the United States.Judge Merchan noted in his ruling that Trump’s arguments largely repeated earlier motions that had been previously rejected. “Defendant’s motion for a stay of these proceedings… is hereby denied,” Merchan wrote. Trump's attorneys had asked the judge to delay sentencing while they appealed his conviction by a Manhattan jury.Merchan indicated he is considering an unconditional discharge, sparing Trump both imprisonment and probation. However, this would still make him the first US president to enter the White House as a convicted felon.Trump, 78, was certified the winner of the 2024 election after a contentious campaign. His second term begins January 20, 2025, marking a remarkable political comeback after his 2020 defeat and the Capitol riot that followed.","Donald Trump was convicted of falsifying business records in 2023.

The highly anticipated inauguration of US President-elect Donald Trump will take place on January 20, 2025, marking the start of his second, non-consecutive term. Scheduled for noon ET, the event will occur at the US Capitol in Washington, DC. The swearing-in ceremony will begin at 12 pm ET (11 am CT).This inauguration is set to coincide with Martin Luther King Jr. Day, a federal holiday, making the historic occasion even more significant. It will be the second time Inauguration Day falls on the same day as MLK Day, with the first instance happening during President Bill Clinton's second inauguration in 1997.Trump’s swearing-in ceremony will officially begin at noon, and shortly after, he will take the oath of office, making him the 47th president of the United States. This marks a remarkable comeback for the 77-year-old, who served as president from 2017 to 2021 and now returns to the White House after four years out of office.The inauguration will also be a day of reflection on the country’s democratic system. The Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies has selected the theme, “Our Enduring Democracy: A Constitutional Promise,” recognising the Founding Fathers' commitment to preserving the continuity of the United States’ government.Following the swearing-in, Trump will join vice-president-elect, who will also take the oath of office. Then, the newly sworn-in president and vice president will participate in the inaugural parade, which will proceed down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House. Once at the White House, the two will view the parade from a stage at the front lawn.Weather advisories have been issued, with the DC area expected to experience snow and freezing rain. Attendees are warned to prepare for potential delays and disruptions. As this is a national special security event, increased security measures will be in place, with collaboration between federal and local law enforcement.Lawmakers are expected to gather for the certification process of the 2024 election results, which is a formal event but was disrupted four years ago when Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol. This year, Biden and the Democrats have committed to respecting the election results and ensuring a smooth transition of power.The inauguration is not just a political event; it will also be a celebration of democracy. Once Trump and Vice President-elect are sworn in, the public will see an inaugural address and the traditional pass in review.Although the inauguration is a formal event, Trump’s personal victory rally will take place beforehand. Scheduled for January 19 at Capital One Arena in Washington, the rally is expected to attract a large crowd. With a capacity of 20,000, it’s set to build excitement for the big day.While the details of international attendance remain uncertain, key world leaders have been invited to attend the inauguration. Chinese President Xi Jinping and other international leaders have received invitations, though it’s unclear who will actually attend. One notable absence will be Russian President Vladimir Putin, who will not be present.For those wishing to attend the inauguration, the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies makes a limited number of tickets available through members of Congress. These tickets, though free, are a prized opportunity to witness the historic event in person.Another noteworthy feature of the inauguration is the flag protocol. President Joe Biden has ordered US flags to be flown at half-staff in honour of former President Jimmy Carter, who passed away at the age of 100. Trump will be the first president to take office with the flags at half-staff.As Trump prepares to return to the White House, the event will be streamed widely, allowing millions around the world to witness history. This victory marks not only the Republicans’ win over the Democrats and the defeat of presidential candidate Kamala Harris, but also brings hope for both parties working together to strengthen one of the world’s most powerful superpowers.","The inauguration of US President-elect Donald Trump will take place on January 20, 2025, marking the start of his second, non-consecutive term.

Canada's Justin Trudeau on Monday finally announced his resignation as both the Prime Minister and the leader of Liberal Party after days of suspense amid intensifying pressure on him to step down. He made the announcement during an address which was expected for a long time.""Over the holidays I had time to reflect,"" he said before announcing the decision.""I intend to resign as party leader, as Prime Minister after the party selects its next leader...Last night I asked the president of the Liberal Party to start that process,"" Trudeau said adding, ""he will leave office as soon as the ruling Liberal party chooses a new leader.""""This country deserves a real choice in the next election, and it has become clear to me that if I'm having to fight internal battles, I cannot be the best option in that election,"" he said.Trudeau was facing criticism over a range of issues including the soaring cost of food and housing. He maintained silence in recent weeks amid growing calls to step down and the sudden resignation of the finance minister on December 16.Initially celebrated for restoring Canada's liberal values upon his 2015 election, the 53-year-old leader's popularity has significantly declined. This political crisis arrives at a challenging time for Canada.As he stepped down, the Liberal party is facing a leadership vacuum mere months before the upcoming legislative elections, due by October's end.Recent months have seen Trudeau's support diminish, with his government barely surviving no-confidence votes while facing calls to step down.Despite his commitment to lead the Liberals through elections, he faced additional challenges from US president-elect Donald Trump , who has proposed a 25-percent tariff on Canadian imports.A significant blow came in December when Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland resigned over disagreements regarding Trump's proposed actions, marking the first public cabinet opposition to Trudeau.In response to political instability, Trudeau implemented substantial cabinet changes, replacing one-third of his team that month.His November visit to Trump at Mar-a-Lago aimed to prevent trade disputes. Trump has subsequently criticised Trudeau on social platforms, referring to him as Canada's ""governor"" and supporting the notion of Canada becoming America's 51st state.After his 2015 victory, Trudeau secured additional electoral wins in 2019 and 2021. Current polls show him trailing Conservative Pierre Poilievre by 20 points.Justin Trudeau, firstborn of former prime minister Pierre Trudeau who passed in 2000, entered politics after various careers including snowboard instruction, bartending, security, and teaching.His political career began in 2008 as a Member of Parliament representing a Montreal working-class constituency.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on Monday his decision to step down as leader of the Liberal Party and prime minister. This comes after escalating internal dissent and calls for his resignation, culminating in a tipping point when tariff threats from US President-elect Donald Trump strained Trudeau’s alliances. Billionaire and Tesla CEO Elon Musk reacted to the news with a short but pointed comment: “2025 is looking good.”Musk’s reaction aligns with his earlier prediction on social media that Trudeau would lose the upcoming Canadian elections, scheduled for October 2025. Musk made this prediction during an exchange on X (formerly Twitter) when a user sought his opinion on Canadian politics. “He will be gone in the upcoming election,” Musk had confidently stated.This isn’t the first time Musk has targeted Trudeau. Over the past year, Musk has repeatedly criticized the Canadian prime minister and his government for policies he perceives as restrictive.One of Musk's sharpest remarks came after the Canadian government required online streaming services to register for regulatory controls. Musk called the move ""shameful,"" accusing Trudeau of trying to ""crush free speech in Canada.""The tech billionaire also lambasted Trudeau during the trucker protests, where the Canadian government invoked emergency powers to manage dissent. Musk labeled the government’s actions as authoritarian.Musk’s disdain for Trudeau reached a boiling point when Trudeau made comments about the global rise of ""regressive"" forces during a speech last month. Trudeau specifically condemned Kamala Harris’s loss in the U.S. presidential race, calling it a setback for women’s progress, while also criticizing Donald Trump’s political influence.Musk responded by calling Trudeau an “insufferable tool,” sparking heated debate online.As Trudeau prepares to step down, his leadership faces increasing scrutiny.

Kamala Harris certifies Trump's poll win 4 years after Capitol attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-harris-certifies-trumps-poll-win-4-years-after-capitol-attack/articleshow/117006107.cms,"WASHINGTON: In an ironic turn driven by constitutional procedure, Kamala Harris, who lost the 2024 polls to Donald Trump after calling him a threat to democracy, on Monday certified his election to the White House as the 47th US president.In another twist of fate, the constitutional procedure unfolded four years to the day (Jan 6) after Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol after he claimed the 2020 election was stolen from him. There were no such doubts this time as lawmakers gathered in a capital blanketed by 6-8 inches of snow - which also kept crowds at bay - to uphold a process that has been the norm for more than two centuries.As incumbent vice-president, and therefore president of the Senate, Harris was in the chair of joint session of Congress as lawmakers open sealed certificates from 50 US states, each of which contained a record of that state's electoral votes. The results were read out loud and an official count was tallied and conveyed to the chair for her to formally declare the winner of the election.The final certification, done in less than 30 minutes, backed up preliminary findings that Trump won 312 Electoral College votes to Harris's 226.Harris pre-empted any doubts that she would derail the process by releasing a clip before the event saying she will, as the vice-president, perform her ""constitutional duty"" and ""sacred obligation...guided by love of country, loyalty to our constitution, and unwavering faith in the American people""."" Peaceful transfer of power is one of the most fundamental principles of American democracy... it is what distinguishes our system of govt from monarchy or tyranny,"" she said.MAGA Republicans rejoiced at what they saw as discomfiture of the defeated Democratic candidate having to certify her own defeat as much as the victory of her opponent after a bitterly fought election. Only twice in recent US history has this happened: Richard Nixon was vice-president when he had to certify his opponent John F Kennedy's win, and Al Gore was vice-president when he lost to George W. Bush. ""Being put in the position of certifying an election that you lost has to be one of the most difficult and humbling experiences that you could have in public life,"" David Thomas, a former aide to Gore told 'The Hill'.MAGA megaphones also rejoiced at the imminence of Trump bailing out Jan 6 insurrectionists. ""President Trump will be giving clemency, pardons & commutations, to J6'ers!!"" Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene posted on X. There will now be a two-week political lull before the Trump is inaugurated on Jan 20.

According to Soares, the situation quickly escalated when the other driver, 26-year-old Gladior Kwesiah from Rhode Island, repeatedly slammed on his brakes. “He kept slamming on his brakes and then when we got to the intersection, he hit a light and he was in front of me,” Soares told WHDH-TV News. “As soon as we went through, we didn’t even make it across and he slammed on the brakes, so I hit him.”This is when the violent attack began. Police said that Kwesiah stormed out of his car and forcibly removed Soares from her vehicle. Soares, who only intended to take photos of the damage, said Kwesiah grabbed her phone and threw her to the ground. “I tried to defend myself and then he picked me up, and that was when the woman got the video of me being thrown to the ground,” she said. “I remember thinking, ‘I’m in the air right now. I’m in the air.’”The brutal attack was filmed by a witness, and Soares was left on the ground with multiple injuries.

Vice President Kamala Harris faced a poignant moment in American history Monday, as she presided over the certification of her own electoral defeat, officially recognizing Donald J. Trump as the next President of the United States.Standing solemnly in the House chamber, Harris wielded the gavel with calm precision as Congress tallied the Electoral College votes: 312 for Trump and 226 for Harris. Her announcement of Trump’s victory was met with cheers from Republican lawmakers, while a polite smile from Harris conveyed her acceptance of the moment.Moments later, Harris read the votes for vice president, certifying Republican JD Vance in the role she will soon vacate. Both parties rose in applause, acknowledging Harris’s composed execution of her constitutional duty . The scene was a stark contrast to the chaos of January 6, 2021, when rioters stormed the Capitol in an attempt to disrupt the certification of President Joe Biden’s victory.In a brief video released earlier in the day, Harris reaffirmed her commitment to the Constitution and the peaceful transfer of power . After the session, she remarked, “Today was about what should be the norm—the peaceful transfer of power. Democracy is fragile, but today, America’s democracy stood.”Harris’s demeanor mirrored her earlier refusals to question election integrity or repeat baseless allegations, in sharp contrast to Trump’s actions following his 2020 defeat. Her quiet acceptance underscored her commitment to democratic norms and the rule of law.While Harris has not disclosed her future plans, speculation surrounds a possible 2028 presidential run or a gubernatorial bid in California. For now, she remains focused on fulfilling her obligations and promoting democracy's resilience.Monday’s ceremony joins a historical lineage of vice presidents, from Richard Nixon in 1960 to Al Gore in 2000, who have presided over the certification of their electoral defeats, demonstrating grace in the face of loss.

What’s next for Canada?

The political landscape in Canada took a sharp turn on January 6, as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced his resignation, citing internal discontent and the recent departure of his finance minister. But while the Liberal Party braces for its next chapter, the internet has been having a field day turning Trudeau’s exit into meme gold.Trudeau’s announcement sparked an avalanche of reactions online, with users on X (formerly Twitter) leading the charge. One user hilariously tied Trudeau’s political fate to Donald Trump’s recent re-election as U.S. President, quipping, “Trump’s victory ended Justin Trudeau’s career. Cause and effect, folks!”Another post brought in a sports twist, referencing NBA star Joel Embiid’s game with the Philadelphia 76ers on the same day. The caption read, “Justin Trudeau resigns before Embiid scores tonight.”A particularly viral meme involved a comical “wind mishap.” A video showed Trudeau stepping out to make his resignation speech, only for a gust of wind to blow his speech papers away. The caption? “HAHAHAHA Trudeau’s papers resign before he does!”And, of course, there were digs at Trudeau’s legacy. One user posted a reaction video with the caption, “People who be desperate for attention,” clearly aimed at Trudeau’s dramatic exit.Despite stepping down, Trudeau will stay on as Prime Minister until the Liberal Party elects a new leader. However, the political waters remain turbulent. New Democratic Party (NDP) leader Jagmeet Singh, once an ally, announced plans to present a no-confidence motion against Trudeau’s government when Parliament reconvenes.While Trudeau’s reign as PM is ending, his tenure—marked by highs, lows, and a touch of celebrity flair—has cemented his place as one of Canada’s most talked-about leaders. But for now, the internet seems more interested in his memes than his legacy.Canada waits for its next chapter, but social media is already writing the first draft—with humor as its pen.","Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced his resignation on January 6, citing internal discontent and the recent departure of his finance minister.

What is the case?

'Imran Khan broke all records'

A Pakistani court has postponed the verdict announcement in GBP 190 million Al-Qadir Trust corruption case against former Prime Minister Imran Khan. The verdict is now scheduled for January 13, according to Islamabad accountability court staff.The delay was attributed to Judge Nasir Javed Rana's leave, the court staff said. Both the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) prosecutor and the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder's lawyers have been informed about the postponement. This marks the second delay in the case. The verdict, initially reserved on December 18, was first scheduled for December 23The case alleges that Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, received land and billions of rupees from Bahria Town. In exchange, they allegedly legalized £190 million returned to Pakistan by the UK during Khan's tenure in office.In December 2023, the NAB filed a corruption reference against the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder, Bushra Bibi, and several others. The investigation focused on the alleged acquisition of hundreds of acres of land for the Al-Qadir University Trust, which reportedly caused a GBP 190 million loss to the national treasury.The charges state that Imran Khan and other accused individuals misappropriated PKR 50 billion (equivalent to GBP 190 million at the time), transferred by the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) to the Pakistani government, ARY News reported.As part of the investigation, NAB filed a corruption reference against Imran Khan, Bushra Bibi, and six others in connection with the Al-Qadir University project, which was initially registered on December 26, 2019.Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif recently reiterated the corruption allegations against Khan in this case. “There has been a lot of corruption in the last 75 years, but Imran Khan broke all records,” Asif said, further alleging that Khan and his associates were heavily involved in corrupt activities.","The verdict is now scheduled for January 13, according to Islamabad accountability court staff.

Does Pakistan minister's comment on Ghazni signal foreign policy shift?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/does-pakistan-ministers-comment-on-ghazni-signal-foreign-policy-shift/articleshow/116973163.cms,"NEW DELHI: Pakistan's old antic to taunt India by naming its missiles after Afghan invaders has taken an unexpected turn in the wake of a new conflict with Afghanistan.The controversy ignited when Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif described Mahmud of Ghazni - a figure celebrated in Pakistan's historical narrative - as ""merely a plunderer"". His remark, delivered during a televised interview, stunned many in a country where school textbooks have long celebrated Mahmud for his raid on the Somnath temple in India in 1026. This dispute put the spotlight on naming of missiles after figures who invaded India to rile the country.Pakistan has named its missiles after Ghazni who raided and destroyed the legendary Shiv Mandir at Somnath, after Ahmad Shah Abdali who won the third battle of Panipat after defeating the Marathas and massacring thousands of them, and after Muhammad Ghori who defeated Prithviraj Chauhan.The choices of invaders from Afghanistan were deliberately meant to not only rile India but also leave no doubt that Pakistan's ballistic missile programme was India-centric, a narrative that resonated domestically, while deflecting international scrutiny.Asif is a hardliner himself. This time, however, he seemed to target a different audience. His comment came amid escalating tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Pakistan recently conducted airstrikes in Afghanistan, claiming it targeted Pakistani Taliban operatives allegedly harboured by the Afghan Taliban. Analysts suggest Asif's critique of Mahmud was less about historical revisionism and more an attempt to antagonize the Afghan Taliban.The Afghan govt promptly denounced Asif's statements as reckless. Within Pakistan, the remarks sparked a polarizing debate. Some welcomed the re-evaluation of Mahmud's legacy, while others, including members of Asif's own political party, rebuked him. Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed, a former information minister, urged Asif to consult Romila Thapar's work on Somnath. Thapar, a respected Indian historian, posits that Mahmud's attack was motivated by economic and political factors rather than religious zeal, challenging the colonial-era framing of it as a Hindu-Muslim conflict.As the controversy lingers, it raises a provocative question: If Mahmud of Ghazni is no longer regarded as a hero, should the Ghaznavi missile be renamed? This debate transcends mere symbolism, hinting at broader shifts in Pakistan's foreign policy, historical narratives, and regional positioning, amid growing international and domestic pressures.","Defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif described Mahmud of Ghazni as ""merely a plunderer"" His comment came amid escalating tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
