A corporate litigator at a prestigious law firm in San Francisco, has clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts of the Supreme Court , as well as for Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his tenure as an appeals court judge.Raised in a suburb of San Diego, California, Usha's upbringing emphasised education and hard work.

As a Gates fellow at Cambridge, she engaged with left-wing and liberal groups and was a registered Democrat in 2014.Usha and JD Vance first met at Yale Law School and were married in Kentucky in 2014. Their wedding included a Hindu priest presiding over a separate ceremony. The couple has three children together.Usha Vance has been instrumental in her husband's political success. She played a key role in helping JD Vance organise his thoughts on the social decline in rural white America, which inspired his best-selling memoir, ""Hillbilly Elegy."" The memoir was adapted into a film directed by Ron Howard in 2020.In the past, Usha has made some rare public appearances alongside JD Vance during his campaign from the Ohio Senate seat.As the US presidential elections approach, former President Donald Trump announced JD Vance as his Vice Presidential pick. Trump confirmed Vance's candidacy through a social media post.""Usha Vance is a highly accomplished attorney and daughter of Indian immigrants—and her husband brings youth and diversity to the Trump ticket,"" said AI Mason, a US-based global real estate investment advisor and entrepreneur, speaking to ANI.

Everything he says and does is built on a foundation of so much thought. He's always trying to do better,"" said Usha Vance.On supporting her husband, Usha told Fox, ""There are a few different reasons...One is that I grew up in a religious household. My parents are Hindu, and that was one of the things that made them such good parents, that makes them really very good people.

This just felt right for him.""The interview was conducted three weeks before JD Vance was announced as Trump's running mate for the upcoming US presidential elections.JD Vance was born James David Bowman in Middletown, Ohio, to a mother who struggled with addiction and a father who left the family when he was a toddler. Raised by his grandparents, Vance's challenging early life shaped his perspectives.The Trump campaign has stated that following his near-death experience, the former president will focus on calling for unity in times of tragedy, instead of criticising his political adversaries. This approach will be pivotal as he faces off against President Biden in the 2024 election rematch.","Usha Chilukuri Vance is the wife of J D Vance, who was recently announced as Donald Trump's vice presidential pick for the upcoming US elections.

Mehbooba Mufti asked the government.""Your narrative has been going on for 6 years, what did you achieve? You have suffered a major setback in North Kashmir,"" she added.""The incumbent DGP is more busy fixing things politically.

After the previous video of Manorama brandishing a gun went viral, the Pune Rural police last week said a probe would be conducted to ascertain facts, including whether she possessed a licence for the firearm.

The two-minute video shows Manorama Khedkar, accompanied by her security guards, engaged in a heated argument with the neighbours. She can be seen yelling at a man with a pistol in her hand. She walks up to him and waves the gun in his face before concealing it in her hand. Puja Khedkar, a 2023-batch IAS officer, is accused of posing as an OBC non-creamy layer candidate in her Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) candidature. She also claimed that she was visually and mentally disabled, but refused to take tests to corroborate her claims.She came under the spotlight after reports about her alleged demands for a separate office and official car and unauthorised use of a beacon on her private car during her posting in Pune emerged. She was subsequently transferred to Washim from Pune. However, the government on Tuesday put on hold the district training programme of the controversial IAS officer as she was summoned back to the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration in Uttarakhand's Mussoorie for ""necessary action"".

"Kanchanjunga Express accident: Drivers of goods train had 30 hours of rest, hit emergency brakes before crash",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kanchangunja-express-accident-drivers-of-goods-train-that-had-30-hours-of-rest-hit-emergency-brakes-before-crash/articleshow/111780627.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS), probing the reason behind Kanchanjunga Express's fatal collision with a goods train, shared provisional findings highlighting multiple lapses in the signalling and operating procedures that led to the accident .In the findings released on Tuesday, it has been mentioned that the loco pilot and assistant loco pilot of the goods train, which rammed into Kanchanjugha Express killing ten people, had taken a rest for over 30 hours.It has been found in the probe that the goods train was moving at the speed of 75 kmph when the driver applied an emergency break to bring it down to 40 kmph just before the collision.The CRS identified that a ""wrong paper authority"" or T/A 912 to cross defective signals had been issued to the loco pilot of the goods train involved in the crash. The paper authority failed to specify the speed the goods train should adhere to while crossing the defective signal.In the investigation, it was found that besides the Kanchanjunga Express and the goods train, five other trains had entered the section after the signals became defective until the accident occurred.The CRS noted that despite issuing the same authority, different speed patterns were followed by the loco pilots, with only the Kanchanjunga Express adhering to the norm of moving at a maximum speed of 15 kmph and stopping for one minute at each defective signal.The CRS emphasised the inadequate counselling of loco pilots and station masters regarding train operation in automatic signalling territory, creating misinterpretations and misunderstandings of rules.The incident was classified under the ""Error in Train Working"" category.In the probe report, the commissioner has also listed recommendations for the Railway Board, which include bringing uniformity in the standard operating procedure (SOP) for giving paper permits in case of automatic signal failure .It has recommended expediting the rollout of the Kavach mechanism, an anti-collision system which is installed in trains to avert accidents.The report also said that frequent failure of automatic signalling systems is a matter of great concern and needs quick resolution.Ten passengers died and 41 were injured when a fast-moving goods train rear-ended the Kolkata-bound Kanchenjunga Express near Siliguri in north Bengal on June 17 morning.Six of the ten who lost their lives were in the fourth-last bogie, a general compartment. The other three dead were the loco pilot of the goods train; the guard of the passenger train; and a Railway Mail Service official.","Ten passengers died and 41 were injured when a fast-moving goods train rear- ended the Kolkata-bound Kanchenjunga Express near Siliguri in north Bengal on June 17 morning.

Bilaspur bench of Chhattisgarh HC took five years to uphold the trial court verdict and SC another six years to acquit him of murder charges as it found that prosecution failed to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubts.One Ratnu Yadav was arrested on the allegation of forcibly drowning his stepmother on March 2, 2013 at village Kharora, in Raipur.The trial court convicted him on July 9, 2013 through a fast track trial and sentenced him to life imprisonment. HC upheld the trial court verdict on April 7, 2018.As no advocate was appearing for him, SC engaged advocate Shridhar Y Chitale as amicus curiae to assist the court in reaching a just conclusion on scrutiny of the evidence placed on record by the prosecution. Chitale said postmortem report indicated that the death was due to drowning but the prosecution has not discharged the burden of proving that it was homicidal death.The amicus also pointed out that the witness, the person before whom the accused is claimed to have made an extrajudicial confession, had turned hostile during the trial, thus taking away the credence of the prosecution story that the man forcibly drowned his stepmother.A bench led by Justices A S Oka and Rajesh Bindal said, ""The normal rule of human conduct is that if a person wants to confess to a crime committed by him, he will do so before the person in whom he has implicit faith. It is not the case of the prosecution that the appellant (Yadav) had a close acquaintance with this witness for a certain length of time before the incident. Moreover, the version of the witness in examination-in-chief and cross-examination is entirely different. Therefore, in our considered view the testimony of the witness is not reliable.""After finding some more similar discrepancies in the prosecution case, the bench set aside the trial court and the HC judgments, acquitted the accused and said, ""the appellant's guilt has not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.""","One Ratnu Yadav was arrested on the allegation of forcibly drowning his stepmother.

"Who are the Kashmir Tigers - terror outfit that has claimed responsibility for attacks in Doda, Kathua in J&K",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/who-are-the-kashmir-tigers-terror-outfit-that-has-claimed-responsibility-for-attacks-in-doda-kathua-in-jk/articleshow/111789452.cms,"NEW DELHI: The sudden surge in terror incidents in Jammu & Kashmir has once again put the spotlight on Kashmir Tigers - a terror outfit that has claimed responsibility for many of these attacks in the last three years. The existence of Kashmir Tigers first came to the fore in January 2021 after the abrogation of Article 370 when they claimed responsibility for attacking a police bus in Sringar, killing three soldier and injuring several others.According to police, Kashmir Tigers is a shadow group of the banned terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammad.Kashmir Tigers has once again claimed responsibility for two deadly attacks in the past one week that have killed 9 soldiers.Five army personnel, including a Junior Commissioned Officer, were killed and as many were injured on July 8 when heavily armed terrorists ambushed a patrolling party in the remote Machedi area of Jammu and Kashmir's Kathua district. The terrorists targeted an army truck, part of a routine patrolling party, with a grenade and gunfire on the Machedi-Kindli-Malhar road near Badnota village in Lohai Malhar, approximately 150 km from Kathua town. After the ambush, the terrorists fled into the nearby forest, as the army, assisted by police and paramilitary personnel, retaliated.In Doda, four army personnel, including an officer, died after being injured in a gunfight with heavily armed terrorists. This was the third major encounter between security forces and terrorists in the forests of Doda district in the past three weeks.Troops of the Rashtriya Rifles and Special Operations Group of Jammu and Kashmir Police had launched a joint cordon and search operation at Dhari Gote Urarbagi in the Desa forest belt, some 55 km from Doda town, late on Monday evening when the encounter took place. After a brief exchange of fire, the terrorists tried to escape but were chased by the troops led by an officer despite the challenging terrain and thick foliage. This led to another firefight around 9 pm on Monday in which five soldiers were critically injured. Four of them, including the officer, later succumbed to injuries.Kashmir Tigers, which is a shadow outfit of Pakistan-based JeM , claimed responsibility for both these attacks.Since its formation in 2000 by Masood Azhar, the JeM has carried out several terrorist attacks in India including Jammu and Kashmir. The JeM was enlisted as a ‘Designated Foreign Terrorist Organisation’ by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Resolution 1267 and the group’s leader Masood Azhar was designated as a ‘Global Terrorist’ in 2019 by the UNSC. JeM, after its ban, has propped up several proxy groups to carry out terror attacks.The government had informed Parliament in March 2021 that a total of 42 terrorist organisations like the Lashkar-e-Taiba and the Jaish-e-Mohammed were banned for their involvement in various acts of terrorism. The outfit has been implicated in several high-profile attacks in India, including the 2001 Parliament attacks and 2016 attack on the Indian Air Force base in Pathankot.In Janaury this year, Union home ministry declared the People’s Anti-Fascist Front (PAFF), a proxy outfit of Jaish-e-Mohammed, as a “terrorist organisation”.","Kashmir Tigers has once again claimed responsibility for two deadly attacks in the past one week that have killed 9 soldiers.

BAGESHWAR: A self-styled godman quietly built an unauthorised temple on government land at over 5,000 meters (16,500 feet) on the Sunderdhunga glacier in Bageshwar , Uttarakhand. Baba Yogi Chaitanya Akash claimed to have received divine instructions to construct the temple at the eco-sensitive spot high up in the mountains.Mahendra Singh Dhami, a villager, said, “The Baba convinced villagers to support the project, saying Devi Bhagwati appeared in his dreams and directed him to build the temple at Devi Kund .The kund, a sacred spot for pilgrims and locals, has practically been turned by this man into a swimming pool. He can often be seen bathing there. It is desecration. There is no doubt about that.”Another local resident, Prakash Kumar, said, “This is blasphemy. For centuries, our deities have visited the kund during the Nanda Raj Yatra every 12 years. Now, this so-called baba has misled villagers and established this temple against our traditions.”Caught napping, the local administration has now launched an investigation into the unauthorised construction. Kapkot sub-divisional magistrate Anurag Arya said a team from the forest department, police, and revenue office will soon visit Devi Kund to remove the encroachment and take appropriate action against Yogi Chaitanya. Arya said, “I became aware of this issue only recently.”ND Pandey, ranger, Glacier Range, added, “We have received communication about this (the mandir’s construction). A team is being dispatched to assess the situation at the location.”The construction has also brought into focus intelligence and enforcement failures, especially when the state is conducting a large-scale anti-encroachment campaign in sensitive zones. The ease with which unauthorised individuals can operate in sensitive areas without detection has raised serious concerns among locals and officials alike.",Baba Yogi Chaitanya Akash claimed to have received divine instructions to construct the temple at the eco-sensitive spot high up in the mountains.

TOI

CHENNAI: Exposing more tentacles of the gold smuggling racket at Chennai airport , government has suspended an undisclosed number of immigration officials for their suspected links with the smugglers .A top Intelligence Bureau official said three of the officials had been placed under suspension. But airport sources toldthat many more officers have faced action.“The number is being under-reported to avoid scrutiny of the immigration section by other agencies such as Directorate of Revenue intelligence (DRI) and Customs ,” an official said.The charge against the suspended personnel is that, for a cut from the smugglers, they collected gold from carriers arriving at the airport and sneaked it outside to receivers. They are also accused of allowing flyers through without scrutinising passports and other documents properly.An IB officer, who did not wish to be identified, said the nexus of the three officers with gold smugglers was being probed. One of them is Saravanan, who was on deputation to the IB. The officer refused to name the other two. “Action is being taken for the charges against them as mentioned in the memo,” he said.The officer said the suspension procedure was initiated only for internal procedural lapses. “We got intelligence that they allow flyers without verification of documents under the Emigration Check Not Required (ECNR) category. How long they have been doing this and the money trail are being probed. If their involvement in gold smuggling had been proved, they would have been booked by now,” he said.The officer said the suspension orders were issued before Customs busted a cartel that smuggled in 267kg gold, worth about Rs 167 crore, in about two months. They used a souvenir shop as a front at the international terminal.Officials said they have detected similar offences in the past and suspended erring personnel. At least 45 immigration personnel, including many state police personnel on deputation to IB, are deployed at the airport for clearing international passengers.","Officials accused of allowing flyers through without scrutinising passports and other documents properly.

He will face Biden again in November.Trump's nomination became official with the vote of Republican National Committee delegates in Milwaukee. He hit the threshold with votes from Florida, announced by his son Eric, according to AP report. The convention hall erupted in cheers as state after state voiced support for Trump.Trump's campaign, aiming to expand his appeal among moderates and people of color, designed an optimistic convention. However, the shooting incident targeted at Trump disrupted American politics, redirecting focus from the GOP's agenda and Trump's legal issues to concerns about political violence and national stability.Vivek Ramaswamy , a former GOP primary candidate, shifted his aggressive rhetoric, urging the country to unite. Speaking at an event hosted by the conservative Heritage Institute, Ramaswamy said, “The enemy is not the Democrats, it is an ideology.”Hours before the first convention session, Trump received favorable news when a federal judge dismissed the prosecution in his classified documents case. Trump celebrated the dismissal on his Truth Social platform, calling for the dismissal of his other legal cases as well.“As we move forward in Uniting our Nation after the horrific events on Saturday, this dismissal of the Lawless Indictment in Florida should be just the first step, followed quickly by the dismissal of ALL the Witch Hunts,” Trump wrote.Republican Party chairman Michael Whatley said that the convention’s programming would not change following the shooting. The agenda will feature over 100 speakers focusing on everyday issues and Trump’s plans to help working Americans.“We have to be able to lay out a vision for where we want to take this country,” Whatley said. He emphasized that the central message would focus on future plans rather than past grievances or promises of retribution.“We are going to have the convention that we have been planning for the last 18 months. We are a combination of relieved and grateful that the president is going to be here and is going to accept the nomination,” he added.Delegates will update the GOP’s policy platform, which has not been revised since 2016. The proposed platform, just 16 pages long, avoids giving Democrats ammunition on key issues, including abortion. It doesn’t call for a national abortion ban, despite the Supreme Court’s recent decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.“More divisiveness would not be healthy,” said Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council.The convention’s speaking program will include Republicans charged with crimes related to the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. Former White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, jailed for contempt of Congress, is expected to speak after his release. Nevada GOP Chair Michael McDonald , also facing criminal charges related to the 2020 election, will present Trump with the party nomination.Democrats have scaled back counterprogramming during the Republican convention. The Biden campaign pulled down its ads, and Vice President Kamala Harris postponed a Florida appearance focused on Trump’s opposition to abortion rights. The pro-Democratic group American Bridge delayed releasing trading cards highlighting controversial Republican positions.The convention is taking place in Democratic-leaning Milwaukee, a key swing state where Trump lost narrowly four years ago.

Assassination attempt on Trump: Was there a second shooter?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/assassination-attempt-on-trump-was-there-a-second-shooter/articleshow/111789785.cms,"Former US President Donald Trump received an enthusiastic welcome from his supporters during the opening night of the Republican National Convention on Monday. This appearance came just two days following an assassination attempt that left his right ear grazed by a bullet.As Trump entered the Fiserv Forum in downtown Milwaukee, he sported a noticeable bandage covering the injured ear.The crowd erupted in chants of ""Fight! Fight! Fight"" while pumping their fists, echoing Trump's response in the immediate aftermath of the incident.Mouthing the words ""Thank you"" to the energetic audience, the former president took his seat in a box accompanied by some of his children and US Senator JD Vance, whom Trump had selected as his running mate earlier that day.Meanwhile, the FBI is continuing with its investigation of how an armed individual managed to access the rooftop of a building and open fire on Trump. Before the shooting, police had received reports of a suspicious person, and witnesses had alerted authorities to an armed man on a nearby roof while Trump was delivering his speech.The assassination attempt resulted in injuries to Trump and two others, as well as the death of Corey Comperatore, a 50-year-old former fire chief who was protecting his family.However, an audio forensic analysis conducted by experts from the National Center for Media Forensics at the University of Colorado in Denver suggests the possibility of a second shooter in the incident that took place in Butler. According to Catalin Grigoras and Cole Whitecotton, ""The first three shots were consistent with alleged weapon A, the next five were consistent with alleged weapon B and the final 'acoustic impulse' was emitted by a possible weapon C."" While one of the shooters has been identified and another was a Secret Service sniper, the identity of the third potential shooter remains unknown.As per a substack by Stephen Bryen, former deputy under secretary of defense, despite the FBI's assertion that the identified shooter acted alone, this controversial audio forensic analysis raises questions that warrant further investigation and peer review. Beyond the audio forensics, other aspects of the incident require attention.The initial burst of gunfire originated from the identified shooter's location. A second burst was detected from an unclear location, distinct from the first. Additionally, there may have been a third shooter who fired a single shot. Forensic acoustic experts propose the involvement of at least two shooters, excluding the Secret Service snipers , Bryen wrote in his substack ""weapons and strategy"".Moreover, the exact number of shots fired by the Secret Service snipers on the rooftop behind Trump is unknown. Most reports indicate that it took only one shot to neutralize the shooter. The agents, equipped with sophisticated sniper weapons—one mounted on a tripod and another on a small stand for a prone shot—are believed to have fired after the shooter initiated gunfire. However, this sequence does not entirely match the acoustic evidence. The evidence suggests that the final single shot, if confirmed, may have been fired by the snipers, resulting in the shooter's death by a single headshot, Bryen said.""The Secret Service sniper(s) did their job, but there are still questions about the timing as the threat could have been eliminated much sooner and lives perhaps could have been saved. Bullets flying around the shooter but not instantly killing him also could have been a partial deterrent,"" Bryen wrote.To ensure a thorough and unbiased investigation, a solid FBI investigation with Congressional oversight is necessary. The FBI possesses the forensic capabilities required to conduct a proper investigation, but strong leadership and oversight are essential to prevent a sloppy or politically biased review.(With inputs from agencies)",Former US President Donald Trump received an enthusiastic welcome from his supporters during the opening night of the Republican National Convention on Monday.

JD Vance , Donald Trump 's choice for vice president, has not lived an unexamined life. Here are 27 things to know about him, drawn from his best-selling 2016 memoir, "" Hillbilly Elegy ,"" and the many other things he has said or written since.1.At birth, it was James Donald Bowman. It changed to James David Hamel after his mother remarried, and then it changed one more time.2.His father left when he was 6. ""It was the saddest I had ever felt,"" he wrote in his memoir. ""Of all the things I hated about my childhood,"" he wrote, ""nothing compared to the revolving door of father figures.""3.One of the most harrowing scenes in the book occurs when he's a young child, in a car with his mother, who often lapsed into cycles of abuse. She sped up to ""what seemed like a hundred miles per hour and told me that she was going to crash the car and kill us both,"" he writes. After she slowed down, so she could reach in the back of the car to beat him, he leaped out of the car and escaped to the house of a neighbor, who called the police.4.He spent much of his childhood with his grandfather and grandmother -- papaw and mamaw, in his hillbilly patois. He described his mamaw's ""affinity for Bill Clinton"" and wrote about how his papaw swayed from the Democrats only once, to vote for Ronald Reagan. ""The people who raised me,"" he said in one interview, ""were classic blue-dog Democrats, union Democrats, right? They loved their country, they were socially conservative.""5.But then his biological father, who was deeply religious, re-entered his life. ""When we first reconnected, he made it clear that he didn't care for my taste in classic rock, especially Led Zeppelin,"" he wrote. ""He just advised that I listened to Christian rock instead.""6.Vance wrote that he would ""never forget the time I convinced myself I was gay."" Not yet old enough to feel attracted to the opposite sex, he worried something was wrong. ""You're not gay,"" his mamaw told him, and even if he were, she reassured him, ""that would be OK. God would still love you."" As he wrote, ""Now that I'm older, I recognize the profundity of her sentiment: Gay people, though unfamiliar, threatened nothing about mamaw's being. There were more important things for a Christian to worry about.""7.He called the matter a ""bizarre distraction"" from more pressing issues. Though he also said that ""gay marriage is the law of the land in this country. And I'm not trying to do anything to change that.""8.. In 2019, when he was 35, Vance was baptized into the Catholic Church. He chose St. Augustine as his patron saint. ""Augustine gave me a way to understand Christian faith in a strongly intellectual way,"" he explained in an interview that year. ""I also went through an angry atheist phase. As someone who spent a lot of his life buying into the lie that you had to be stupid to be a Christian, Augustine really demonstrated in a moving way that that's not true.""9.Vance joined the Marines after high school and eventually served in Iraq, where, he wrote, ""I was lucky to escape any real fighting,"" but it was a time that ""affected me deeply nonetheless."" He worked in public affairs and, for a time, as ""the media relations officer"" for a large military base, Cherry Point, in North Carolina.10.""I choke up when I hear Lee Greenwood's cheesy anthem 'Proud to Be an American,'"" he wrote. ""When I was 16, I vowed that every time I met a veteran, I would go out of my way to shake his or her hand, even if I had to awkwardly interject to do so.""11.Vance has said he was offended by the racist birther conspiracy against Barack Obama -- peddled most famously by Trump -- and alarmed at how people in his hometown seemed so susceptible to such things.12.The former president was ""unable of saying anything outside of the elite consensus,"" Vance said in 2022, calling Obama ""a walking, talking Atlantic magazine subscription.""13.As he wrote: ""I lived among the newly christened members of what folks back home pejoratively call the 'elites,' and by every outward appearance, I was one of them: I am a stale, white, straight male. I have never felt out of place in my entire life. But I did at Yale.""14.They married in Kentucky in 2013, and were blessed by a Hindu pundit. ""Usha definitely brings me back to earth,"" Vance said in a 2021 interview with Megyn Kelly.15.One was Amy Chua, a law professor known for her memoir, ""Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother,"" who encouraged Vance to write his own book. Another was David Frum, a speechwriter in the George W. Bush administration and cheerleader for the Iraq War who helped Vance make early career connections. Frum has since become disillusioned with his former charge, describing him as a hyper-ambitious shape-shifter who would do anything or be anyone to get ahead.16.In 2022, Daniels observed that Vance had ""veered in a different direction"" that he described as being ""a little regrettable.""17.He voted instead for the independent candidate Evan McMullin.18.He predicted that Trump could be the GOP nominee in 2016, though he did not think Trump would win the general election. As he said in an interview the following year, ""It's amazing, and I can't repeat enough: As much as I saw Trump winning the nomination, I was super wrong about his prospects in the general.""19.Among other things, Vance has called Trump ""cultural heroin"" and wondered if he would be ""America's Hitler.""20.The controversy around Kavanaugh's nomination to the court seemed to be a pivotal moment in both Vance and his wife's political journey. ""My wife worked for Kavanaugh, loved the guy,"" he told Ross Douthat, a New York Times columnist. ""You start looking around and say, 'If they can do this to him, can they just do this to any of us?'""21.He has called Democratic leaders ""childless cat ladies."" And he said that ""if your worldview tells you that it's bad for women to become mothers but liberating for them to work 90 hours a week in a cubicle at The New York Times or Goldman Sachs, you've been had.""22.After Yale, he worked for Thiel's firm Mithril Capital, and Thiel donated $15 million to Vance's race in Ohio.23.The firm, Narya Capital, was named after a mythical object from J.R.R. Tolkien's trilogy: Narya was one of three Elven rings of power, worn in the third age by the wizard Gandalf. Vance has invested in various services including a Catholic prayer and meditation app and the right-wing, video-sharing platform Rumble.24.The mogul brokered a meeting at Mar-a-Lago. Vance had been trailing in the polls during his primary race in Ohio.

WASHINGTON: Facing growing criticism over a massive security failure, the US Secret Service on Monday vowed to cooperate with an independent review after a shooter was allowed to open fire on Donald Trump .The 78-year-old former president was injured but survived an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday, a brazen attack that shocked a nation already deeply polarized ahead of the November election.""The Secret Service is working with all involved federal, state and local agencies to understand what happened, how it happened, and how we can prevent an incident like this from ever taking place again,"" the agency's director Kimberly Cheatle said in a statement.""We understand the importance of the independent review announced by President (Joe) Biden yesterday and will participate fully,"" Cheatle added.Trump was speaking at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, when multiple bangs rang out.He clutched his ear, with blood visible on his ear and cheek, then ducked to the floor as Secret Service agents swarmed onto the podium, surrounding him and rushing him to a nearby vehicle.The shooter and a bystander were killed, and two spectators injured.Newly surfaced video backs up reports from witnesses that they had called out to police and physically pointed at the shooter as he lay on the roof preparing to open fire, the Washington Post reported Monday.The shots targeting Trump rang out 86 seconds after the first audible attempts to warn the police, the Post said, citing an analysis it did of video clips from the scene of the attack.Biden ordered a full review of the security at the rally, as well as at this week's Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where Trump will be crowned the party's presidential nominee.In an interview with NBC on Monday, the president said he feels ""safe with the Secret Service,"" though he added it was an ""open question"" whether they should have better anticipated the shooting at the Trump rally.Biden has also ordered Secret Service protection for independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an environmental lawyer and long-time vaccine skeptic who has no chance of winning in November, but whose candidacy could potentially sway close contests in key swing states.The Secret Service faces intense scrutiny over how a gunman aiming an assault rifle was able to take position on a roof some 500 feet (150 meters) from one of the most protected political figures on the planet.With Trump set to star at the convention, Cheatle said the agency was working to toughen security.The Secret Service designs plans for major events ""to respond to a kinetic security environment and the most up-to-date intelligence,"" her statement said.Earlier in the day, Trump had called for Secret Service protection for Kennedy ""in light of what is going on in the world today.""""Given the history of the Kennedy Family, this is the obvious right thing to do!"" Trump wrote on his Truth Social web site.Kenedy's uncle, President John F. Kennedy, was assassinated in Dallas, Texas in 1963. Five years later, the candidate's father, Robert, was shot to death in Los Angeles while on the campaign trail.The US Secret Service is responsible for the safety of the president, vice president and former presidents, and their families, as well as major election candidates and visiting foreign heads of state.","The US Secret Service vows to cooperate with an independent review of the Donald Trump shooting.

Six foreign nationals were found dead in a luxury hotel room in central Bangkok on Tuesday. Thai authorities suspect that the individuals, all of Vietnamese descent with two holding dual US nationality , were victims of poisoning. This incident has drawn significant attention due to its mysterious nature and the potential implications for Thailand's tourism industry .The bodies were discovered in the upscale Grand Hyatt Erawan hotel in the Pathum Wan district, a popular area known for its luxury shopping and tourist attractions.The deceased, three males and three females, had booked several rooms in the hotel under seven different names, but their bodies were all found in one room.

The bodies were discovered by hotel cleaning staff after the guests failed to check out. Authorities suspect that the deaths were caused by poisoning, but an autopsy is needed to confirm this.The victims were six individuals of Vietnamese descent, including two with dual US nationality. There were three men and three women among the deceased.According to Bangkok police chief Lt Gen Thiti Sangsawang, ""There were no signs of a struggle."" Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin also confirmed that the deaths were not related to a robbery or shooting incident.Initial reports suggest that the victims may have ingested a toxic substance. ""Our hypothesis is that they ingested something that killed them,"" PM Thavisin said.Lt Gen Thiti Sangsawang noted that the bodies were found foaming at the mouth, which is consistent with poisoning. ""This was not self harm, but someone caused the deaths,"" said Thiti.Authorities believe a seventh Vietnamese person could be involved in the incident. Police are actively searching for this individual to gather more information about the case.Thai police are conducting a detailed investigation to determine the cause and motive behind the deaths. The prime minister has ordered a swift investigation to minimize the impact on tourism.

One of those relatives, Paul Guard, mostly blames the conflict raging in eastern Ukraine a decade ago for the missile attack that killed 38 Australian citizens and permanent residents including his parents, Toowoomba doctors Roger and Jill Guard.""I don't think anyone intended to bring down a passenger plane. So in that sense, I'm heartbroken that the conflict continues,"" Paul Guard told Australian Broadcasting Corp.""But I think that a lot of families would really have just liked an acknowledgement that what happened was wrong and that Russia should not have been waging war,"" the son added.The conflict has since escalated into a full-scale war with Russia's invasion of its smaller neighbour in February 2022.The pro-Russia rebel-held border region from where a Soviet-era Buk surface-to-air missile was fatefully launched and the fields where much of the debris landed after the Boeing 777 disintegrated is now territory controlled by the Russian military.Moscow has repeatedly denied responsibility for MH17 's destruction and refused to hand over two Russians and a Ukrainian convicted by a Dutch court in absentia in 2022 of murder.Russia continues to be pursued under international law by the Netherlands through in the European Court of Human Rights and by Australia and the Netherlands jointly through the International Civil Aviation Organization Council, or ICAO, over its alleged role in bringing down MH17.Australian foreign minister Penny Wong told Wednesday's service she was ""appalled"" that Russia had withdrawn from the ICAO proceedings in June.""The case will continue and we will not be deterred in our commitment to hold Russia to account,"" Wong told the gathering that included foreign diplomats.""Today, on behalf of the Australian government, I recommit again to our collective pursuit of truth, justice and accountability for the outrages perpetrated on 17th July, 2014,"" she added.A commemoration is also planned in the Netherlands later Wednesday at a monument near Schiphol Airport, from where MH17 left on its way to the Malaysian city of Kuala Lumpur.Australian Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus will represent Australia at that monument, were 298 trees were planted to commemorate each victim and sunflowers like those that grew at the crash site.He expected the Netherlands-Australia case against Russia would be back before the ICAO in October despite Moscow's withdrawal.""We won't let this go until we've brought Russia to account,"" Dreyfus said.The Netherlands was home to 196 victims. As well as Australia, victims also came from Malaysia, Indonesia, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Germany, the Philippines, Canada, New Zealand, Vietnam, Israel, Italy, Romania, the United States and South Africa.An international investigation initiated in the UN Security Council by the Netherlands, Malaysia and Australia concluded that the Buk missile system that destroyed MH17 belonged to the Russian 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade. The investigation concluded the missile was driven into Ukraine from a Russian military base near the city of Kursk and returned there after the plane was shot down.Tony Abbott was Australia's prime minister when MH17 was shot down. Abbott recalled on Wednesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin became physically aggressive when the Australian raised MH17 and the Ukraine conflict on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders' summit in Beijing in 2014.Putin said through an interpreter that Ukrainians were all fascists, had brought down MH17 themselves and that Ukraine had no right to exist, Abbott said.""Then as we were going back into the conference - and this was really quite an extraordinary thing - he suddenly turned, grabbed the elbows and tried to shake me and then pushed me away. And he said in English, where he's quite fluent: Look, you are not a native Australian but I am a native Russian,' and pushed me away,"" Abbott told ABC.""I think what he was trying to say to me in his own rather blunt and brutal way was that how could I as a citizen of a settler society understand the blood and soil and mystical attachment that he had to every last inch of Mother Russia?"" Abbott said.""So it was pretty obvious to me right back then what he was on about.

Instead, Guo used the funds to sustain a lavish lifestyle.""Miles Guo, an exiled Chinese businessman and purported billionaire, brazenly operated several interrelated fraud schemes, all designed to fleece his loyal followers out of their hard-earned money so that Guo could spend his days in his 50,000 square foot mansion, driving his $1 million Lamborghini, or lounging on his $37 million yacht,"" prosecutors said, referring to Guo by an alias.A unanimous jury found Guo guilty on nine of the 12 criminal counts he faced, including racketeering conspiracy, securities fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering. He faces decades in prison, with sentencing scheduled for November 19.Guo, who goes by several aliases including Miles Guo, Miles Kwok, and ""Brother Seven,"" raised over $1 billion from his online followers between 2018 and 2023 through investment and cryptocurrency schemes. Prosecutors detailed how the money funded his opulent lifestyle.""Thousands of Guo's online followers were victimized so that Guo could live a life of excess,"" said US Attorney in Manhattan, Damian Williams, following the verdict.Guo's political activism and connections with prominent right-wing US politicians and activists earned him hundreds of thousands of followers, primarily Chinese expatriates. His association with Steve Bannon, former White House chief strategist under Donald Trump, further bolstered his profile.Guo and Bannon frequently appeared together in online videos and launched the New Federal State of China in 2020, aiming to overthrow the Chinese Communist Party. Bannon was later arrested over an unrelated fraud case while on Guo's yacht in Connecticut but was pardoned by then-President Trump.Despite efforts by Guo's lawyers to portray him as a fervent opponent of China's political system, rather than being driven by money, the jury was not convinced.

Happy interfaith couple

Usha Vance , 38, would be the possible first Indian American second lady, if Donald Trump and her husband J D Vance win the Nov 5 election. She would be the first Hindu spouse of a vice-president.Friends from her childhood described her as a “leader” and a “bookworm”. Brainy, ambitious and pragmatic, she moved from an extracurricular-studded four years at Yale, where she got a bachelor’s degree in history, to Cambridge, where she earned a master of philosophy degree, and moved in liberal and left-wing circles.As of 2014, she was a registered Democrat. Now a corporate litigator at a prestigious San Francisco law firm, Usha has clerked for Supreme Court chief justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh when he was an appeals court judge. It’s a conspicuous resume for a woman whose husband gave a speech in 2021 titled “The Universities are the Enemy”.Usha has played a quiet but key role in her husband’s rise. At Yale, she helped Vance organise his ideas about social decline in rural white America, which formed the basis of his memoir, “Hillbilly Elegy”. And she made rare but well-choreographed appearances with Vance as he sought the Ohio Senate seat. In an interview last month, Usha, who mostly stays out of the spotlight, sounded a note of ambivalence about the prospect of her husband running for V-P. “I’m not raring to change anything about our lives..., but I believe in JD.”Vance has said his wife “is not a Christian” but was “very supportive” of his deepening faith. Asked about the challenges of an interfaith marriage, Usha said, “There are a lot of things we agree on, I think, especially when it comes to family life, how to raise our kids. So I think the answer really is, we just talk a lot.”(With inputs from NYT & PTI)","Usha Vance, 38, would be the possible first Indian American second lady, if Donald Trump and her husband J D Vance win the Nov 5 election.

The former president had a thick stack of papers on his desk: printouts of Vance's copious broadsides against Trump. Vance's past criticisms had included an essay in one of Trump's least favorite magazines, The Atlantic, where Vance described Trump as ""cultural heroin"" -- a purveyor of false promises to the white working class.Trump, using an expletive, bluntly told Vance: You said some nasty stuff about me. The discussion that followed was described in detail by two people with knowledge of the meeting who insisted on anonymity to talk about a private conversation.Vance's next move was crucial. This was the first time he was meeting Trump, and Vance needed the former president to like him or at least leave the meeting with an open mind. Vance -- the author of ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" a best-selling memoir about his troubled upbringing and the struggles and pathologies of the white working class -- was running for the open U.S. Senate seat in Ohio as a Republican populist, a Never Trumper turned pro-Trumper.Vance decided to immediately apologize. He told Trump that he had bought into what he described as media lies and that he was sorry he got it wrong. Of all people, Vance told Trump, Vance himself should have understood.Trump agreed, telling Vance that he should have understood because Vance had written the ""Hillbilly Elegy"" book. His implication was that Vance should have supported him because Trump's own base of non-college-educated voters angry about globalization, immigration and foreign wars were exactly the people Vance purported to represent.At that point, Trump seemed disarmed, and the meeting went on for almost two hours. They discussed the 2020 election and the Ohio race, but mostly they talked about the difficulties of politics. It had been less than a month since Trump left the White House a pariah, in the wake of a pro-Trump mob storming the Capitol after the president had spent two months lying about a stolen election.Trump closed the conversation by asking Vance what he wanted. Trump told him that everyone else had already been down to Mar-a-Lago begging for his endorsement -- a reference to Vance's potential opponents in the Ohio Senate primary.Vance, who along with a spokesperson for Trump declined to comment for this article, told the former president he wasn't going to do that.Trump, surprised, asked Vance if he wanted the endorsement.Vance said that of course he wanted it, but that Trump should let him run his race, and see how he did. Vance said he would not be the type of candidate who would attack the former president when the media came after him.Trump seemed intrigued. All right, Trump replied, telling Vance, whom he called JD, to take care and check in from time to time.Trump had relatively little personal contact with Vance after that first meeting, but he took note as Vance kicked off his Senate campaign in July 2021, ran circles around his primary opponents in debates and became a frequent presence on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight,"" at the time the top-rated show on cable television.Trump was impressed. He told allies he thought Vance was smart and handsome -- ""those beautiful blue eyes,"" he'd say repeatedly -- great on TV and a killer at the debates. Trump, who split with allies at the influential conservative group Club for Growth in backing Vance, felt validated when Vance won the general election against his Democratic rival, Rep. Tim Ryan, and then immediately became one of Trump's most vocal supporters in the Senate.When Trump announced his third campaign for president, in November 2022, at a time when most Republicans wanted nothing to do with him, Vance distinguished himself by immediately signaling to Trump's staff that Vance was all in.Since then, Vance has played his cards nearly perfectly, making himself visible at key moments, promoting himself assertively but not too much, publicly backing Trump during his Manhattan criminal trial and having the right people champion him to the former president at the right time.That day in early 2021, Vance was ushered into Trump's office at Mar-a-Lago by one of the most secretive donors in GOP politics: Peter Thiel, the billionaire founder of PayPal who broke with Silicon Valley to support Trump for president in 2016. Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., was at the meeting, too.Though initially skeptical of Vance's loyalty, Donald Trump Jr. became close friends with him over the course of the Senate campaign. He became a huge asset when allies of Vance's rivals for running mate tried desperately to undermine Vance with a pressure campaign aimed at changing the elder Trump's mind.Now, the 39-year-old Vance has become the party's vice-presidential nominee.An experienced fighter in the modern culture wars, Vance is in many ways a different type of running mate from the one Trump selected in 2016: Mike Pence was a Ronald Reagan conservative and evangelical governor whose penchant for spontaneous prayer unnerved the man under whom he served. In Vance, Trump is picking someone whose impulses for fighting against existing institutions and challenging global systems match his own.Yet the arc of how Trump made his choices in 2016 and in 2024 had similarities. He had described both Pence and Vance as ""out of central casting."" Then Trump began to question his options and solicited the opinions of everyone he spoke to, before ultimately returning where he began.But the lead-up to Trump's selection of Vance was even more chaotic than it was with Pence. It was uncertain down to the final hours, with a frantic lobbying effort until the last possible moment by anti-Vance forces, including Rupert Murdoch and his allies, with some of it playing out in public.Trump seemed uncertain right until the end, privately raising some of the negative comments Vance had made about him in the past. Allies of Vance, including Elon Musk and Tucker Carlson, ran a counter campaign to reassure Trump about the selection, with supportive calls to the former president continuing until the moment Trump finally told Vance of his decision, on Monday afternoon, less than half an hour before he announced his choice on social media.Six months into his Senate campaign, Vance was seen by most as the walking dead.Throughout the fall of 2021, he was savaged in the Ohio Republican Senate primary by television commercials that re-aired his past condemnations of Trump. Vance's support fell precipitously in private polling, and even Trump privately voiced concerns about the impact the ads were having in the race. Many Republican operatives believed Vance's chances of surviving the onslaught were close to zero.He began his comeback on a debate stage.At a March 2022 debate among the crowded Senate Republican field, Vance's two main rivals -- Josh Mandel, a former Ohio state representative and treasurer, and the businessman Mike Gibbons -- nearly came to blows on the stage.Vance seized the moment. He described their fight as ""ridiculous"" and confronted Mandel for using Mandel's military service as a ""political football"" earlier in the debate, calling it ""disgraceful,"" setting off a burst of applause in the room. The moment presaged Vance as a deft performer on his feet, one who would eventually eviscerate his general election rival, Ryan, on the debate stage.Trump relished that primary debate confrontation and felt that it showed Vance had what it took. Trump has always paid close attention to debate performances, crediting his own showing in the 2016 debates for his victory over Hillary Clinton. He told allies he liked what he'd seen from Vance. One month after the debate, Trump formally endorsed him.Trump announced his own candidacy for president a week after the November 2022 midterms.His campaign launch was a disaster.High-profile MAGA candidates endorsed by Trump had lost midterm races they should have won. Trump was blamed for the disappointing results, and most Republican elected officials stayed away from his presidential kickoff event at Mar-a-Lago.Shortly after he announced his campaign, Trump ignited a string of controversies, including calling for the termination of parts of the Constitution to overturn his 2020 defeat and dining with Kanye West, a rapper whose stream of vitriol against Jews stirred outrage, and Nick Fuentes, a notorious white supremacist.Trump found himself abandoned by many in the Republican-leaning media, with Fox News extolling his main presidential primary rival, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, and his favorite newspaper, The New York Post, giving DeSantis the headline title: ""DeFuture."" A chorus of prominent conservatives was saying it was time for fresh blood.Vance was not among them.He signaled privately to Trump's team, shortly after the midterms, that he planned to endorse the former president. He said he wanted to make an intellectual argument for Trump that would resonate with the donor class and other elites, according to a person briefed on the exchanges. He ended up announcing his endorsement in late January 2023 in an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal, praising Trump's foreign policy. The proactive support was reassuring to the Trump team amid so many threatened defections at a time when the campaign seemed rudderless.The Trump campaign found its direction a month later, in February. It started with a visit to a derailment site of a train that had been carrying hazardous chemicals through East Palestine, Ohio.President Joe Biden and his advisers had been criticized for days for not visiting the site, and Vance was among the most vocal critics of the federal response. Biden's administration blamed policy rollbacks from Trump's era for the derailment.Trump's son Don Jr. soon had a thought: What if his father visited the site? He ran the idea past both Vance and Trump's top adviser, Susie Wiles, and a plan was soon in place. Flying aboard his plane, dubbed Trump Force One, from Florida to Ohio for the event, Trump was watching Fox News. Vance was on the air. The former president turned to his son and observed that Vance had been ""incredible, hasn't he?"" -- using an expletive to underscore the point.When the plane landed, it was clear that Trump was stepping into a media vacuum created by Biden's absence. Walking down the movable stairs from his plane on the tarmac, Trump appeared on the extensive television coverage as if he were still president.By the fall of 2023, chatter was growing that Vance was a top contender to be Trump's running mate. But while advisers to both men had discussed the possibility informally, it had not become a topic of conversation between Trump and Vance.Vance was slow to believe Trump would actually pick him as a running mate, people close to him said. His view started to change around the New Hampshire presidential primary in late January, as he campaigned for Trump in the state and drew a warm response.Vance's allies began an aggressive strategy to show he could be successful in two areas that preoccupied Trump: performing well in adversarial interviews on mainstream news channels, and bringing in new financial supporters.Vance's advisers booked him on a slew of shows on CNN, NBC, ABC and CBS, including one appearance that caught Trump's eye, with the CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer, shortly after Trump was convicted in his Manhattan criminal trial. Vance was the first vice-presidential hopeful to show up in court to support Trump, and he stepped up his aggressive televised defense of Trump after the conviction.Vance helped pave the way for Trump with some Silicon Valley donors. He spent months working on David Sacks, an entrepreneur whom Vance has called ""one of his closest confidants in politics,"" to support Trump. That effort resulted in a $12 million event for the Trump campaign. Sacks said at the event that it ""would never have happened"" without Vance's support, according to a person familiar with his remarks.Musk, one of the world's richest men and the owner of the website X, has emerged as a quiet ally of Vance's, according to two people briefed on the relationship. Musk has viewed Biden's reelection as an existential crisis for the nation and told Trump directly that he should choose Vance as his running mate, describing the Trump-Vance pairing as ""beautiful,"" according to one of the people with knowledge of their relationship. Musk did not respond to requests for comment.Yet it was Don Jr. and his allies who pushed Vance most insistently -- publicly and privately.For most of the year, Trump's associates have said that the former president was not especially enamored of any of his VP choices, doubtful that any of them would make much of a difference to his chances in November. And yet in recent weeks, he told people that he liked the idea of someone who could carry on his MAGA legacy, something Trump believed the two other top contenders -- Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota -- were not as well positioned as Vance to accomplish.Trump continued playing Hamlet of sorts, polling nearly everyone he encountered about what they thought he should do.The anti-Vance campaign was intense, widespread and carried right up until the final hours before Trump announced his choice. Several major Republican donors, including the hedge fund magnate Ken Griffin, as well as the media mogul Rupert Murdoch, tried to persuade Trump not to choose Vance. (A Griffin spokesperson wouldn't address what he told Trump, saying only that there were a number of good options and that Trump and his team had been ""thoughtful."")Murdoch even went so far as to dispatch senior executives and columnists at The New York Post to meet with Trump and dissuade him from picking Vance. Kellyanne Conway, Trump's 2016 campaign manager who is also close to Melania Trump , argued privately that other options, such as Rubio, were better, according to several people with knowledge of her outreach effort.The Murdoch crowd lobbied aggressively for Burgum, in private and in editorials in The New York Post. When the anti-Vance forces made their arguments to Trump, they focused on Vance's prior criticisms of the former president and on Vance's youth and inexperience. But in many cases, these GOP donors were motivated because they loathed Vance's ideology and policy positions, especially his staunch opposition to U.S. support for Ukraine against Russia.Old comments made by Vance about Trump began to circulate on social media, and were put in front of the former president, who indicated to associates that they had given him pause.But Trump was repelled by a Daily Mail article describing Burgum weeping at various moments -- ""When I see a man cry I view it as a weakness,"" he once said. Allies also brought to Trump's attention the fact that Burgum had signed one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country, a point that could become a liability in a general election.Trump told associates that he viewed Rubio as disloyal for having campaigned in 2016 against Rubio's friend and mentor, Jeb Bush, and wondered whether he could be trusted.In the final days, all three leading candidates made direct pitches to Trump.Burgum let it be known that he had no interest in serving in another role in the Trump administration, a stance that did not play well with Trump, who had mused about making him the secretary of energy, according to two people briefed on the matter.Vance was flown to Mar-a-Lago late last week aboard the plane of Steve Witkoff, a real estate investor and one of Trump's few close friends.When word got back to Tucker Carlson a few weeks ago that Trump might be wavering on Vance, he intervened. Carlson, who was visiting Australia on a speaking tour, phoned Trump and delivered an apocalyptic warning, according to two people briefed on their conversation. He told Trump that Rubio could not be trusted -- that he would work against him and would try to lead America into nuclear war. Carlson, who declined to comment for this article, told Trump that Burgum could not be trusted, either.","JD Vance was running for the open U.S. Senate seat in Ohio as a Republican populist.

'I haven't always agreed ... ': What Nikki Haley said on endorsing Trump as GOP presidential candidate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/i-havent-always-agreed-what-nikki-haley-said-on-endorsing-trump-as-gop-presidential-candidate/articleshow/111796650.cms,"NEW DELHI: Nikki Haley , the former governor of South Carolina , and one-time Trump's rival addressed voters on Tuesday, explaining her reasons for supporting GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump .Haley, who was met with scattered boos at the Republican convention , began her speech by firmly endorsing the former president. Although this wasn't surprising, as she had previously stated her intention to vote for him and released her convention delegates to support him, her affirmation was met with resounding applause.She then focused on persuading her supporters, even those who had backed her long after Trump had secured the nomination, to support the candidate she had once harshly criticized.""You don't have to agree with Trump 100% of the time to vote for him. Take it from me,"" she said. ""I haven't always agreed with President Trump. But we agree more than we disagree.""Haley further added, ""I will start by making one thing perfectly clear. Donald Trump has my strong endorsement.""Talking about the contrasting situations during the presidencies of Barack Obama, Joe Biden, and Donald Trump. Haley pointed out, ""When Barack Obama was president, Vladimir Putin invaded Crimea. When Joe Biden was president, Putin invaded all of Ukraine. But when Donald Trump was president, Putin did nothing. No invasion no wars.""Haley attributed this difference to Trump's perceived toughness, suggesting that Putin refrained from attacking Ukraine due to Trump's strong leadership. She emphasised that a strong president focuses on preventing wars rather than starting them.The remainder of her speech addressed foreign policy, immigration, and crime, while also taking jabs at Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris. The crowd booed whenever she mentioned their names. While her speech may not have been sufficient to completely mend the damage her campaign caused among Trump's loyal supporters, it was a crucial beginning if she intends to have a future in Republican politics.Her address marked a gradual easing of tensions between Haley and Trump following a contentious, yearlong campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.The speech, a collaborative effort between Haley and the Trump campaign, was approved by Republican convention officials and represents Haley's most recent attempt to unify the party behind her former competitor.Throughout her campaign earlier, Haley had urged GOP voters to support her to avoid the ""chaos"" that she believed accompanied the former president.Despite losses in New Hampshire and her home state of South Carolina, Haley resisted calls to withdraw from the race and endorse Trump. Instead, she intensified her criticisms of the former president and his age, often highlighting polls that suggested she would perform better than Trump against President Joe Biden in a general election. Additionally, Haley warned that Trump's legal issues would likely dominate the campaign cycle.","Haley was met with scattered boos at the Republican convention.

"Term limits, ethics code: US President Biden eyes Supreme Court reforms",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/term-limits-ethics-code-us-president-biden-eyes-supreme-court-reforms/articleshow/111795557.cms,"US President Joe Biden is seriously considering implementing term limits for US Supreme Court justices and establishing an enforceable ethics code . This move is in response to mounting concerns over accountability for the justices.These proposals would mark a significant shift for Biden, who has traditionally resisted calls for reforming the high court.He has grown increasingly vocal about the court’s current trajectory, which he feels is departing from mainstream constitutional interpretation , as per the Associated Press sources.The most significant changes Biden is considering would require approval from Congress, a challenging prospect given its division. Nonetheless, Biden's proposals may energize his voter base, particularly given his potential 2024 Republican rival, Donald Trump 's, boasts about appointing three conservative justices during his tenure. Biden is also contemplating a constitutional amendment to remove the broad immunity for presidents recently affirmed by the court. This arises after Trump claimed immunity from prosecution for his actions on January 6, 2021, when a mob of his supporters stormed the US Capitol.Biden's considerations follow increasing frustration among Democrats over recent Supreme Court decisions that overturned longstanding precedents on abortion rights and federal regulatory powers. Moreover, questions about the court's ethics have surged following revelations about justices, including Clarence Thomas, who accepted luxury trips from a GOP megadonor.In a recent interview with BET, Biden predicted, ""there are probably going to be two more appointments"" within the next four years as justices retire. He criticized Trump for nominating three conservative justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade, adding, ""Just imagine if he has two more appointments, what that means.""The Supreme Court has not yet commented on these proposals.In a conversation with the Congressional Progressive Caucus, Biden mentioned, ""And by the way, I’m going to need your help on the Supreme Court, because I’m about to come out. I don’t want to prematurely announce it, but I’m about to come out with a major initiative on limiting the court and what we do and – I’ve been working with constitutional scholars for the last three months, and I need some help.""Public sentiment appears to support such changes. According to a 2022 poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, about 2 in 3 Americans favor term limits or a mandatory retirement age for Supreme Court justices.A separate June survey revealed that confidence in the court remains low, with 4 in 10 US adults saying they have hardly any confidence in the people running the Supreme Court. Additionally, 7 in 10 Americans believe the justices are more influenced by ideology, while only about 3 in 10 think the justices provide an independent check on other government branches by being fair and impartial.In November, the Supreme Court adopted its first code of ethics. However, this policy, agreed to by all nine justices, does not seem to impose significant new requirements and leaves compliance up to each justice.Republicans have long focused on reshaping the federal judiciary and Supreme Court. Former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, notably refused to meet with Obama’s nominee Merrick Garland in 2016, stalling the nomination until Trump assumed office. Trump ultimately succeeded in appointing three Supreme Court justices and 54 federal appeals court judges, significantly altering the judiciary for a generation.Democrats have recently begun to grasp the power of judicial appointments as a political tool. Biden has prioritized judicial nominations , setting a record for appointments at this point in his first term, including some of the judiciary's most diverse picks. He often highlights these accomplishments during his reelection campaign, but Democratic activists are urging him to take further action.Trump criticized Biden’s potential move on his Truth Social platform, stating, ""The Democrats are attempting to interfere in the Presidential Election, and destroy our Justice System, by attacking their Political Opponent, ME, and our Honorable Supreme Court. We have to fight for our Fair and Independent Courts, and protect our Country.""","US President Joe Biden is seriously considering implementing term limits for US Supreme Court justices and establishing an enforceable ethics code.

Nevada county reverses controversial vote and certifies two recounts while legal action looms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nevada-county-reverses-controversial-vote-and-certifies-two-recounts-while-legal-action-looms/articleshow/111795761.cms,"RENO: Commissioners in Nevada's second most populous county certified the results of two local recounts on Tuesday, reversing course on a controversial vote against certification that spurred legal action and put Washoe County in unchartered legal territory.The 4-1 vote overturns a rare move against certifying election recount results from last month's primary in the politically mixed swath of Reno and northern Nevada that had potential implications for how the November elections could play out in one of the nation's most important swing counties.Nevada secretary of state Cisco Aguilar and attorney general Aaron Ford are still waiting for the state supreme court to address a petition they filed last week that seeks to confirm the legal obligations of county commissioners to certify election results. While it is unclear if or when the court will take that up, a ruling could set precedent and apply to county commissions statewide who refuse to certify results in November.Aguilar had said that the circumstances of last week's vote could set ""a dangerous precedent"" that undermines the confidence of voters.Moments before Tuesday's redo of the vote, the county's chief deputy district attorney, Mary Kandaras, recommended that the commissioners certify the vote to follow state law.Once seen as a mundane and ministerial task, election certification has become a pressure point since the 2020 election. During the midterms two years later, a scenario similar to what is unfolding in Washoe County played out in New Mexico after that state's primary, when a rural county delayed certification of the results and relented only after the secretary of state appealed to the state's supreme court.Two Republican Washoe County commissioners, Jeanne Herman and Mike Clark, have consistently voted against certifying results and are supported by the wider far-right movement within the county that promotes election conspiracy theories .But on Tuesday, Clark apologized to his constituents before changing his vote in favor of certification. He said he made the vote after being advised that the commission's certification is not discretionary. He said his vote came ""under extreme duress under the threat of both my position, and prosecution."" Throughout the meeting, he doubled down on his mistrust of the county's election tallies.""I'm not going to call it a vote, because it isn't a vote,"" he said before voting in favor of certifying the recount results. ""We're compelled and we have to.""Republican Commissioner Clara Andriola, who the far-right movement had targeted in the primaries, also reversed course on Tuesday. She has often been the swing vote in election votes - rejecting the label of election denier and thanking the county elections department, while alleging that several ""hiccups"" in the process called for more governmental bodies to look at county elections processes.On Tuesday, Andriola said that she has more recently met with the county's interim registrar of voters, who gave her more confidence in how elections are run in Washoe County. She also spoke with the county district attorney's office, who she said made it clear that the commission's duty is to certify election results without discretion.""Our responsibility is to follow the law,"" Andriola said.The local far-right movement has been on full display at commission meetings, where conspiracy theories about voting machines and distrust of election administrators have become a mainstay during the commission's public comment sections and have led to harassment and high turnover in the local election office the past four years.Amidst the rapid election staff turnover, the county elections department has also made certain administrative mistakes, like sending mail ballots to voters who had opted out of receiving them and misprinting certain local sample ballots, though none that affect tabulation.On Tuesday, most commenters urged the commissioners to not certify the results. Some repeated false claims of stolen elections, broken machines and a ""cabal"" within the county that undermines elections. Others called for a hand recount or a complete redo of the election.One commenter printed out pictures of city and county employees that she accused of corruption. Several times, commission chair Alexis Hill threatened to go into a recess when public comments were interrupted or delved into calling out individuals, rather than the board itself. A few commenters had urged commissioners to certify the vote.""Stand your ground, stay the course. You showed backbone last week. Don't lose it now,"" said Bruce Parks, the chairman of the Washoe GOP that falsely alleged Joe Biden did not win the 2020 election.","Commissioners in Nevada's second most populous county certified the results of two local recounts on Tuesday, reversing course on a controversial vote against certification.

'Politics got too heated': US President Joe Biden returns to campaigning in Nevada following Trump's assassination bid,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/politics-got-too-heated-us-president-joe-biden-returns-to-campaigning-in-nevada-following-trumps-assassination-bid/articleshow/111792590.cms,"President Joe Biden returned to the campaign trail in Nevada on Tuesday with a speech to a crowd of black voters majorly at the NAACP national convention . It was his first political address since the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump .Biden expressed gratitude for Trump’s well-being, calling for a crucial national discussion on the heated nature of current politics, according to Reuters report.His campaign has shifted to a message of unity, pausing ads and attacks aimed at Trump following the incident.""I am all in,"" Biden told the convention audience as they chanted ""four more years.""Biden acknowledged his Republican rival’s safety after the Saturday shooting incident and emphasized the need for a serious conversation in the country.""It's time for an important conversation in our country. Our politics got too heated,"" Biden said.Biden also urged for the prohibition of semi-automatic rifles, such as the AR-15, which was utilized in the recent attack on his political opponent, Donald Trump. ""Join me in getting these weapons of war off the streets of America. An AR-15 was used in the shooting of Donald Trump... It's time to outlaw them,"" Biden said.Following the attempt on Trump’s life, Biden's campaign had removed its television ads, halted verbal critiques of Trump, and instead focused on promoting unity. Earlier, the campaign strategy was centered on criticizing Trump as a threat to US democracy, spotlighting his refusal to concede the 2020 election and his felony convictions. Now, the campaign is poised to strike a balanced tone while still distinguishing the differences between the two candidates.The long-standing and influential NAACP—representing a vital Democratic constituency—has shown waning support for Biden according to recent polls, despite strong turnout for him in 2020. NAACP president Derrick Johnson expressed hope that Biden would address economic struggles and rights concerns within the Black community.""People are concerned about the price of gas, price of bread, but they're also concerned with their growing knowledge around Project 2025,"" Johnson said, referring to conservative policy proposals that have garnered criticism from Trump opponents.One day prior, Biden addressed the nation from the White House Oval Office, urging Americans to lower political tensions and resolve differences peacefully. He described the upcoming November 5 election as a ""time of testing.""In a Monday interview with NBC News, Biden admitted it was an error to use the term ""bullseye"" in reference to Trump during a recent campaign donor call.Biden postponed a trip to Texas meant to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act at the Lyndon B. Johnson presidential library.

"Terror attacks kill 10 soldiers, 5 civilians in Pakistan’s volatile northwest",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/terror-attacks-kill-10-soldiers-5-civilians-in-pakistans-volatile-northwest/articleshow/111791956.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan army said on Tuesday that at least 15 people, including 10 soldiers , were killed in two separate attacks in the volatile northwest bordering Afghanistan and added that security forces killed all 13 assailants in the ensuing gunfights.Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the army’s media wing, reported that two female health workers, two children, and a security guard were killed when terrorists stormed a rural medical facility in militancy-hit Dera Ismail Khan district on Tuesday.Pakistani forces, the ISPR said, “effectively engaged” the assailants, killing three of them and losing two soldiers in the clashes.The announcement came just hours after the military confirmed the deaths of at least eight soldiers in a pre-dawn militant raid against an army base in the garrison town of Bannu on Monday. It stated that security forces killed all 10 assailants in the ensuing gunfight.The attack on Bannu cantonment, the ISPR said, had been orchestrated by militants based in Afghanistan. “The attempt to enter the cantonment was effectively thwarted by security forces personnel, which forced the terrorists to ram an explosives-laden vehicle into the perimeter wall of the cantonment,” ISPR said.It added that the suicide car bombing destroyed a portion of the wall and damaged adjoining infrastructure, resulting in the deaths of the eight soldiers.“In the ensuing operation, our troops effectively engaged the terrorists as a result of which all 10 terrorists were sent to hell,” the army said. “This timely and effective response by the security forces prevented a major catastrophe, saving precious innocent lives,” it added.Locals said the blast was heard miles away and caused damage to nearby houses and shops. They said they saw black smoke billowing above the site and heard gunshots in the cantonment area.A militant outfit allied with the globally designated terrorist group Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) took responsibility for the attack shortly after it started.The ISPR statement attributed the assault to the Hafiz Gul Bahadur group which, according to it, operates from Afghanistan and has used Afghan soil to orchestrate acts of terrorism inside Pakistan in the past.Bannu and adjoining districts in the border province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have particularly seen frequent TTP attacks targeting military and police forces since the Taliban reclaimed power in Afghanistan three years ago.Pakistan maintains TTP leaders and fighters are being increasingly facilitated by the de facto rulers of Afghanistan. The Taliban govt dismisses the allegations, saying TTP is an internal problem for Pakistan to deal with.There has been a sharp rise in terror incidents since PM Shehbaz Sharif announced anewmilitary offensive against militancy and extremism in the country’s northwestern and southwestern border regions. The announcement was vehemently resisted by Pashtun and Baloch leaderships in Baluchistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces through public protests, rallies and digital media campaigns.","At least 15 people, including 10 soldiers, killed in two separate attacks in the volatile northwest bordering Afghanistan.
