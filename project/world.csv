'Republic Day 2026 Flypast Will Be IAF's Tribute To Operation Sindoor': Says Wing Commander Deshwal

New Delhi: From Bactrian camels to Zanskar ponies, a rare contingent of “animal soldiers” will for the first time be seen marching down Kartavya Path joining the 6,050 military personnel during the 90-minute Republic Day parade on Monday.They will be under the command of Captain Harshita Yadav, daughter of a retired IAF officer, and from the first batch of Indian Army’s Remount & Veterinary Corps.Speaking to TOI, she said, “This contingent is very uniquely curated. There are two Bactrian camels from Ladakh, four Zanskar ponies, four raptors (specially-trained birds of prey), 10 military dogs, mostly indigenously-bred. They are all Army soldiers and have different operational roles.”Perfectly adapted to extreme cold, thin air and altitudes above 15,000 feet, the Bactrian camels, which are recently inducted in Army operations, can carry a load of up to 250 kg and traverse long distances in the cold deserts.She said the Indian Army has been using indigenously-bred dogs for quite some time and they are trained basically for two purposes — detection (explosives, mine detection, tracking, search and avalanche rescue) and protection (assault on enemies).“Training of birds like kites or any animal involves neuroscience. Once you understand the science behind these animals and the training part, then these are highly trainable,” Captain Harshita said.IAF Air Commodore Manish Sabharwal, during a Republic Day press preview on Friday, said the S-400 air defence system, which shot down multiple Pakistan aircraft and also a spy plane from a distance of over 300 km deep inside Pakistan, which is a “documented kill”, will also be showcased at the Department of Military Affairs (DMA) tableau during the parade for the first time.The tableau will showcase India's victory in Operation Sindoor last year and the jointness of the three services displayed during the decisive action. One side will feature lethal military weapons that proved crucial during the operation. The other side will depict the destruction of the infrastructure on the side of Pakistan.Major General Navraj Dhillon, Chief of Staff, Delhi Area, said Lt Gen Bhavnish Kumar, GOC, Delhi Area, will head the parade for the fourth time.Battalion, Shaktibaan regiment, drone shakti and robotic mules to take part in the parade for the first time, along with Ladakh Scouts,” he said. He said the Army will feature the debut of a Battle Array Formation showcasing synchronised manoeuvres alongside tanks, missile systems, drones and armoured platforms. The defence assets that will be showcased during the parade will include BrahMos, Akash missile system, Medium Range Surface-To-Air Missile (MRSAM) system, Advanced Towed Artillery Gun System (ATAGS), Dhanush artillery gun, Shaktiban and a static display of some drones.The parade will also see the debut of the Shaktiban Regiment, which has been set up in the artillery. The newly-raised regiment will be equipped with a drone, counter-drone and loiter munition. Eighteen marching contingents and 13 bands will take part in the parade.Akash weapon system and MRSAM system are being fielded in this year's parade. Universal Rocket Launcher System URLS 'Suryastra', which can carry out surface-to-surface strikes up to 300 km, is being showcased for the first time in the parade, Maj Gen Dhillon said.As European Council president Antonio Costa and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen will be the chief guests, a small EU contingent, comprising an officer of the colonel rank, will lead the delegation. Following him in their contingent will be four flag-bearers.A senior military official said women’s participation is also in big numbers. CRPF’s Assistant Commandant Simran Bala will be the first woman officer to lead an all-male contingent at the parade.Captain Samira, a fourth-generation army officer, is the commander of an Army tableau depicting the success of Op Sindoor. She told TOI the tableau will display the indigenously developed military assets and weapon systems used during the Pakistan conflict and will also highlight Atmanirbhar Bharat.DRDO will showcase some of its path-breaking innovations for national security during the parade. Apart from displaying long-range anti-ship hypersonic missile (LR-AShM), DRDO will have a tableau 'naval technologies for combat submarines'.A formation flying named “Operation Sindoor” comprising Rafale, Su-30, Jaguar and MiG-29 combat jets will feature in the IAF's R-Day flypast that will serve as a powerful symbol of the dominance it established during the four-day hostilities with Pakistan last May. A total of 29 aircraft, including 16 fighters, nine helicopters and four transport planes, will be part of the flypast.A total of 30 tableaux to roll down Kartavya Path and 150 years of Vande Mataram will be the theme of the parade.","A rare contingent of “animal soldiers’ will for the first time be seen marching down Kartavya Path.

VIJAYAWADA: A woman allegedly murdered her husband with the help of her boyfriend after lacing biryani with sleeping pills, police said.The incident occurred at Chiluvur village in Duggirala mandal. The victim, Lokam Shivanagaraju, an onion trader, had been married to Lakshmi Madhuri since 2007.The couple had two sons. Madhuri, employed at a cinema ticket counter in Vijayawada, had reportedly developed a relationship with Gopi, a native of Sattenapalli.According to the police, Madhuri viewed her husband as an obstacle to her relationship.

In the early morning, she raised an alarm, claiming he died of a heart attack.Suspicion arose when relatives noticed injuries and bleeding from the victim's ear. The post-mortem confirmed death due to suffocation, leading to the arrest of Madhuri and the detention of Gopi.

Ousted Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina says in an interview with Alpyu Singh that free and fair elections in her country are impossible under Muhammad Yunus’ interim govt and that India deserves a reliable neighbour. Excerpts:

Tarique Rahman

has assumed office as

Bangladesh Nationalist Party

chairman recently. How do you look at his return?

Ex-PM Hasina Calls Yunus “Murderous Fascist,” Warns Bangladesh at Edge of Abyss

A lot of people are questioning whether an election could actually take place in Feb? If so, how will

Awami League

take part, considering that there is a ban on your party?

As atrocities against minorities continue in Bangladesh, India's external affairs ministry reacted by saying there is a disturbing pattern in all this. What do you think is reason behind these recurring attacks?

How can India help in restoring peace in Bangladesh?

What do you think is the future of India-Bangladesh bilateral relations?

The people of Bangladesh should remember that Tarique Rahman has lived in exile in London for years, far removed from the daily realities faced by ordinary citizens. He fled the country because of his role in abetting his late mother, former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, in the embezzlement of public funds. This is not a matter of political disagreement, but of accountability and integrity.BNP leadership has consistently aligned itself with extremist elements when it suits its short-term interests, even at the cost of national stability... it has chosen exclusion, intimidation, and opportunism. Bangladesh deserves leadership that governs from within the country, respects pluralism, and is accountable to the people, not figures who seek power through alliances with radical forces while remaining safely abroad.The question is not whether elections will take place but whether these will be elections in any meaningful or legitimate sense... At present, Bangladesh is ruled by an unelected regime that has appointed itself the authority to rewrite our country's constitution and amend our legislation to ban the nation's most widely supported party from participating in elections.Over half the voters in Bangladesh have confidence in Awami League and would vote for us if Awami League were allowed to participate.It is precisely this fear that has led them to ban us.A govt's most basic duty is to protect its citizens. The interim govt has not only failed in this responsibility, it has actively emboldened this repression. Under Yunus, extremist groups that my govt worked hard to contain have been empowered and elevated to positions of authority. These criminals, many of whom belong to known terrorist orgs, have been allowed to spread a hardline ideology that threatens to remove any trace of diversity from our country and carry out deplorable acts of violence against peaceful Hindus, Buddhists, Christians, Ahmadi Muslims with total impunity. The current climate is the direct result of the appeasement of fundamentalist forces.India has rightly condemned the human rights abuses and political repression that have become all too common under the Yunus regime. They are watching in dismay right now as Bangladesh descends into lawlessness, as minority groups face daily acts of violence, as political imprisonments become the norm, and as harmful, hostile rhetoric emanates from Dhaka. India understands that prosperity of our two nations is tightly linked.n India is Bangladesh's closest friend and longest-standing ally, a relationship built through geography, history and cooperation. Yunus has done considerable damage to this relationship through his empowerment of extremist groups who freely target religious minorities with impunity and his willingness to allow mobs to besiege Indian diplomatic premises and threaten representatives. This is recklessness by an administration with neither the experience nor the mandate to dictate Bangladesh's foreign policy.India deserves a reliable partner in Bangladesh, one that can maintain stability and honour its commitments. We must return to being the friend our neighbours knew they could trust.",Ousted Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina says free and fair elections in her country are impossible under Muhammad Yunus’ interim govt. She says India deserves a reliable neighbour.

Amit Shah Vs Oppn Showdown: Bill To Remove PM, CMs Over Criminal Cases Sparks Big Lok Sabha Ruckus

Experts: 30-day bar not aligned with current procedure

NEW DELHI: An expansive anti -corruption bill has drawn criticism from a legal think tank and two law universities, which told a parliamentary committee that provisions linking the removal of a PM, CM, or minister to 30 days of arrest on serious criminal charges risk political misuse.Representatives of Vidhi Centre for Legal policy, National Law University (NLU)- Odisha and National University of Juridical Sciences (NUJS)- Kolkata, who were invited by the joint parliamentary committee scrutinising the Constitution (130th Amendment) Bill, flagged a host of issues, including that it may override popular will.Two of them suggested the threshold for removal should be ""framing of charges"" as it will introduce an element of judicial scrutiny in the process, people in the know said. Vidhi Centre cautioned that certain provisions may invite constitutional challenges.It said the purported intent behind the bill is laudable and largely complies with constitutional doctrine.Representatives of two of these bodies pointed out that the global consensus, at least in established democracies, for removal of ministers from office is judicial conviction and the proposed law moves away from this and has a low threshold.Existing criminal provisions allow police to seek custody of an accused for up to 90 days in serious offences, and the 30-day bar is not congruent with the current procedure, it was noted.NUJS said the legislation may intend to curb criminality within politics, but it has a “high probability” of severely destabilising Union and state cabinets, sources aware of the details said. The varsity said it has potential to lead to policy paralysis at Centre and states.An investigation can turn into a “potential regime change operation,” NLU said, adding that the bill incentivises retaliation as state police can act against a visiting Union minister after central agencies take action against a chief minister or state minister.Vidhi Centre said, “The framework creates scope for political misuse. Arrests may be timed or selectively pursued.”NLU echoed similar views, saying opposing parties can use its provisions to destabilise legitimate govts. The trend over the past few decades suggests the possibility of its misuse and it will have a negative impact on the country’s democracy, it said. “Automatic removal of a PM or CM overrides the choice of the majority party and the voters,” it said.Though the bill seeks removal from office over arrest in offences where punishment is five years or more, it was also pointed out that there are several serious crimes, including corruption, where punishment may be less than five years.The govt has batted for the bill citing instances of ministers and even a chief minister — Arvind Kejriwal in Delhi — continuing to be in charge despite being under a long period of incarceration on corruption charges. However, it agreed to send the bill to the parliamentary panel headed by BJP MP Aparajita Sarangi for wider consultations. Most opposition parties have refused to be part of the panel.","Vidhi Centre for Legal policy, National Law University (NLU)- Odisha and National University of Juridical Sciences (NUJS)- Kolkata flagged a host of issues, including that it may override popular will.

Tharoor Snubs Congress, Skips Key Meeting; Zelensky Announces First US-Russia-Ukraine Talks

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor did not attend the meeting of Kerala state leadership with AICC high command Friday amid reports that he is upset over a recent ""snub"", even as the party stepped up planning for the upcoming state polls scheduled for mid-2026 and urged netas to put up a united fight.AICC chief Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi met important netas of the Kerala unit for discussion on poll campaign strategy and seat-sharing with allies.Among those who took part in the session were AICC general secretary K C Venugopal, special poll observer Sachin Pilot, senior neta Ramesh Chennithala, state president Sunny Thomas, LoP V D Satheesan, MPs Kodikunnil Suresh, Adoor Prakash, among others. However, Tharoor did not attend despite an invitation.The Thiruvananthapuram MP was in Kozhikode for Kerala Literature Festival where, sources said, he had a lecture scheduled on an important social reformer. Sources said he had informed the party about his inability to attend the meeting. However, Tharoor is said to be upset that Rahul did not acknowledge him while he mentioned other netas on the dais during Kochi ""mahapanchayat"" organised after UDF's victory in local body elections.Tharoor is said to have told the party about his unhappiness about the ""snub"".To media queries, party's state incharge Deepa Dasmunshi denied that Tharoor was unhappy with Congress.The events before Kochi had suggested a thaw between Tharoor and the party, after the MP's repeated statements and political stance over myriad issues had embarrassed the Congress brass. The repeated clashes between him and Congress had even triggered speculations that Tharoor was searching for political space outside Congress.For Kerala polls, Congress is also discussing the return of estranged ally Kerala Congress (Mani). The party has to decide whether MPs will be fielded in state polls, even as it is almost final that most of the MLAs will be repeated. A comfortable victory for UDF alliance over the governing Left bloc in the local body elections last month rekindled hopes about its prospects in the assembly polls.",Congress MP Shashi Tharoor did not attend the meeting of Kerala state leadership with AICC high command Friday.

SRINAGAR\JAMMU: Snowfall and savage winds up to 155kmph pulverised J&K on Friday, blocking highways, causing flight cancellations, shutting down schools, disrupting power, leaving homes roofless and forcing the suspension of Vaishno Devi pilgrimage.In the Valley, IMD reported snowfall of 55cm in Shopian, 45cm in Gulmarg, 20cm in Kupwara, 17cm in Pahalgam, 16cm in Banihal, and 15cm in Sonamarg as the weather system fed by western disturbances began its onslaught late Thursday night.In Jammu, Trikuta Hills, home to Shri Mata Vaishno Devi’s cave shrine, received the first snowfall of the season alongside Doda, Kishtwar, Ramban, and Poonch. “Light to moderate rains lashed several other areas,” an official said in Jammu.The rough spell will linger. According to Mukhtar Ahmad, director of Srinagar’s Met department, a second burst of western disturbance is likely on Jan 26, preceded by light to heavy rainfall on Jan 24 and 25.Vehicular movement was stopped in both directions on the all-important Jammu-Srinagar National Highway due to fresh snowfall around Navyug Tunnel. Several other roads were blocked.At Srinagar airport, no flights moved on Friday. IndiGo said both take-offs and landings had been suspended due to snowfall.“We are closely monitoring the weather and will get you on your way as soon as conditions allow,” the airline added.Power and transmission lines took a beating. Chief minister Omar Abdullah warned of massive losses. “We can figure losses from this point that active power load in the Valley is less than 100 MW today (Friday) against the usual 1700 MW. The gusty winds disrupted the whole transmission system,” Omar, who is also power minister, said.Mehmood Ahmad Shah, MD of Kashmir Power Distribution Corporation, said several roofs fell directly on transmission lines in Srinagar and other districts, hitting electricity supply.IMD put wind speeds at 155kmph in Shopian, 80kmph in Poonch, 76kmph in Reasi, 63kmph in Jammu and 84kmph in Srinagar. In Srinagar’s busy Lal Chowk, battered roof sheets fell and piled up near Clock Tower, bringing traffic to a standstill. Similar scenes were reported from other Valley areas.“The roofs were not anchored properly to the walls,” former Kashmir chief town planner Iftikhar Hakeem said. Architect Sameer Hamdani echoed the view. “Many roofs are constructed as temporary structures, especially in shopping complexes where owners intend to add a floor,” Hamdani said.In Jammu, authorities ordered school closures in Rajouri, Reasi, Poonch and Udhampur for the safety of students and staff. Cops rescued 12 people, including children, stuck in heavy snow in Udhampur’s Chochru Galla area after a daring three-hour mission. Army troopers helped civilians stuck in buses, trucks and other vehicles in Poonch’s Tota Gali area after snowfall.","Snowfall and savage winds up to 155kmph pulverised J&K on Friday, blocking highways, shutting down schools, disrupting power, leaving homes roofless.

'Will Come to Mumbai, Try Cutting My Legs: Annamalai Hits Back at Raj Thackeray

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) president Raj Thackeray posted a cryptic social media message on Friday, saying that if he ever took a “flexible stance” in politics, it would never be driven by ""personal gain.""His remarks came on the 100th birth anniversary of his uncle, Bal Thackeray, the founder of the undivided Shiv Sena . Raj Thackeray left the Sena in 2005 and launched the MNS the following year.The MNS chief posted on X in Marathi, ""Today loyalties are easily sold off. Principles are casually discarded, and politics has become entirely opportunistic. In today's politics, success is measured not by which issues were brought to the forefront or how fiercely regional and linguistic identities were kept alive, but by how much success was achieved in electoral politics and what tricks are employed to get there. """"In Balasaheb's time, there were no such compromises with expectations like these...He himself had no craving for power...Even when Balasaheb had to take a flexible stance in politics at times, his love for the Marathi people never diminished even by a fraction; on the contrary, it only grew stronger. These are the values instilled in us,"" he wrote.Thackeray added that he is giving his word that if he ever took a ""slightly flexible stance in this completely transformed politics,"" it would ""never be for my personal gain or selfish interests.""His statement comes two days after five MNS corporators extended support to Maharashtra deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde 's Shiv Sena in the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) in the Thane district.The move raised eyebrows, as the party had contested the January 15 civic polls alongside the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena (UBT) in several municipal corporations across the state, including the KDMC and Mumbai. The MNS-Sena (UBT) alliance had reunited Raj with Uddhav, Bal Thackeray's son and former Maharashtra chief minister, after 20 years of estrangement.Shiv Sena (UBT) is a faction of the previously undivided Shiv Sena, the other being the Shinde-led group. The party split in June 2022, resulting in the two factions, with the Shinde camp recognised by the Election Commission as the ""real"" Shiv Sena. The split also led to the collapse of the Uddhav Thackeray-led state government.","Mumbai Navnirman Sena (MNS) president Raj Thackeray posted a cryptic social media message on Friday.

'Netaji’s Strategic Realism Matters More Today As World Fragments', Says CDS Anil Chauhan At JNU

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said his govt was following Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's vision of a strong India as a weak nation could not achieve its goals. He added that the country now knew how to build, manage and use power.In a video address to a programme in Andaman and Nicobar Islands on Parakram Diwas, which commemorates Netaji's birth anniversary, Modi said due to the insecurities of those who came to office after independence - a swipe at Jawaharlal Nehru and his successors from Congress - the glorious history of the islands, which were briefly under the control of Bose's Indian National Army during the World War II, were not preserved as they wanted to credit only one family for independence.His govt has taken corrective measures, he added. Home minister Amit Shah lauded Netaji's ""unwavering determination to liberate India"" through his long and fraught journey across different countries and said every youth should read about his life to strengthen their resolve to protect the nation.""Netaji declared an independent India in 1943 by hoisting the tricolour in Andaman and Nicobar Islands,"" he said in a post. In his remarks, Modi said India was making its defence sector self-reliant in line with Bose's vision.India struck its enemies in their homes during Op Sindoor, he said in reference to the military strikes on terror sites in Pakistan after the Pahalgam attack, and destroyed them, he said, emphasising his govt's deft use of power to achieve its goals and the expansion of its defence production.""In their political self-interest, the nation's history was neglected,"" he said, noting that the islands continued to be knowns by the names of British officers before his govt made the correction. Port Blair was now 'Shri Vijaypuram', a name that reminded us of Netaji's victory, he said, recalling that 21 islands of Andamans were named after 21 Param Vir Chakra awardees in 2023.At a presser, BJP slammed Congress for trying to erase Bose's contribution from history in its long tenure in office and said he played the most decisive role in the country's independence. Nehru dismissed Bose's party Forward Bloc as a negative group against Congress and imbued with fascism and communalism, BJP's Sudhanshu Trivedi said, citing comments of B R Ambedkar and others to claim that Bose's campaign had ensured that the colonial rulers were not sure about the loyalty of Indian soldiers.",PM Narendra Modi said his govt was following Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's vision of a strong India as a weak nation could not achieve its goals.

5 girls booked under UP anti-conversion law,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/5-girls-booked-under-up-anti-conversion-law/articleshow/127342164.cms,".

BAREILLY: An FIR has been registered under Section 3 of the stringent Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Act against five minor Muslim girls -- aged between 15 and 17 -- for allegedly getting their 16-year-old Hindu friend to wear a burqa in Moradabad.The incident took place on Dec 12, 2025, but has come to light now after police said that they’ve registered a case following a complaint by the girl’s brother, Daksh Chaudhary, on Friday.If found guilty under this law, an accused, especially if the victim is a minor, can be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term “which shall not be less than 5 years but which may extend to 14 years”.Superintendent of police (rural) in Moradabad, Kunwar Akash Singh, told TOI, “As soon as we received the complaint, a First Information Report (FIR) was registered and further investigation is on.”Section 3 of the anti-conversion law deals with “prohibition of conversion from one religion to another by misrepresentation, force, fraud, undue influence, coercion, and allurement”.“My sister was talking to one of the girls whom she’d met about two months back and had been going out regularly with. The five girls who took away my sister in burqa had may have had some ill intention. So, I approached cops at Bilari police station,” Chaudhary, the complainant, told TOI.A purported video of the incident was widely circulated on social media.In the minute-long video clip, the girls can be seen in a narrow alley between houses. One of them is seen wearing a burqa over her dress with the other girls trying to help her.“The accused girls and the Hindu girl are friends. All are believed to be minors. That afternoon, they were on their way to a restaurant which crosses the victim’s brother’s shop. They didn’t want him to know about it. Fearful of getting caught, the Hindu girl may have worn her friends’ burqa,” said a police officer, privy to the case.He added that since it is a sensitive matter, the local police registered a case following the complaint filed by the family members.“Further investigation is on to find out the backgrounds of the young girls and their motive, if any, behind the incident,” the officer said. As they are minors, police said, they cannot be immediately put the girls in custody.","The incident took place on Dec 12, 2025, but has come to light now after police said that they’ve registered a case following a complaint by the girl’s brother.

Op Trashi-I: Pak terrorist killed in Jammu & Kashmir’s Kathua,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/op-trashi-i-pak-terrorist-killed-in-jammu-kashmirs-kathua/articleshow/127318018.cms,"Operation Trashi-I: Gunfight Erupts In J&K’s Kishtwar; Eight Army Personnel Injured

JAMMU: Security forces shot dead a Pakistani terrorist belonging to the proscribed Jaish-e-Mohammad outfit in Billawar, in J&K’s Kathua district, even as Operation Trashi-I entered its sixth day on Friday, IGP Bhim Sen Tuti said.The slain ultra, Usman, was one of the most-wanted Jaish terrorists who had been active in the Udhampur-Kathua belt for the past couple of years after having infiltrated into India. “He had escaped several encounters in the past, with the latest ones on Jan 7 and Jan 13, in the forests of Kahog and Najote,” an official said.The Army’s Rising Star Corps, in an X post, stated that earlier in the day, a joint team of the Army, CRPF and J&K Police launched a counter-terrorism operation in Kathua’s Parhetar area based on intelligence inputs. While combing a house, the search party came under fire, triggering an encounter in which Usman was killed in close combat.The fire exchange lasted only a few minutes, officials said, terming the encounter a breakthrough for security forces.With three more Jaish ultras believed trapped in the region, troops continued their hunt under Operation Trashi-I, combing the forests of Sonnar, Mandral-Singhpora and adjoining areas in Chatroo belt, notwithstanding treacherous terrain and harsh weather conditions, including snowfall.Operation Trashi-I was launched on Jan 18. That night, an intense gunfight between security personnel and terrorists in Sonnar village near the LoC left eight soldiers injured. One of them, Army Special Forces Commando, Havildar Gajendra Singh, succumbed Jan 19 — the first security force death in a counter-terrorism operation in the Union Territory in 2026.On Jan 20, the cordon was strengthened with the help of aerial surveillance and sniffer dogs, following which, the troops busted a well-concealed terrorist hideout and recovered large quantities of rations, utensils, and consumables. Three-four locals from Sonnar village were detained for questioning, as officials suspected that running such a setup would not have been possible without local help from overground workers.On Jan 21, additional forces were rushed to the operation site to fortify the cordon and block possible escape routes. Amid increased vigil ahead of Republic Day, joint teams of security forces conducted door-to-door searches in localities with a high concentration of Burmese (Rohingyas) and Bangladesh nationals in Bhatindi-Narwal-Rajiv Nagar areas on the outskirts of Jammu, as well as in Rajouri, Poonch, Samba, Kathua, Udhampur and Doda districts as a precautionary measure.After a three-day lull, fresh contact was established with terrorists on Thursday in Kishtwar’s Singhpora. Heavy fire was exchanged between both sides before the ultras managed to escape further into the woods. Meanwhile, in Jammu’s Akhnoor sector, security forces launched a cordon-and-search operation following the alleged sighting of terror suspects in Sumah locality the night before.Operation Trashi-I is the third this year in Jammu division, following clashes earlier this month in Kahog and Najote forests of Billawar in Kathua, south of Pir Panjal range.Kishtwar, a remote district east of the Chenab and south of Kashmir Valley, saw intensified counter-terrorism efforts in 2025 as forces tracked Pakistan-based terrorists through steep terrain and thick forests. At least six gun battles were reported there over seven months. On May 22, an Army trooper was killed and two others wounded in Chatroo. Weeks earlier, three Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists were shot dead in the same area.Security officials said Kishtwar sits astride a traditional infiltration corridor, with terrorists crossing from Pakistan via Kathua and moving through Udhampur and Doda before heading towards Kashmir valley, using forest cover to evade detection.","The slain ultra, Usman, was one of the most-wanted Jaish terrorists.

A disturbing pattern

NEW DELHI: Families of Hyderabad youths allegedly trapped along the Myanmar–Thailand border have made an urgent appeal to MEA and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying their sons were lured with fake job promises and are now being tortured and held against their will.The issue came into focus on Thursday after All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen chief Owaisi posted on X, urging external affairs minister S Jaishankar to intervene in the case of at least 16 Indians allegedly enslaved near the Myanmar–Thailand border. According to Owaisi, three of them are from Hyderabad, from Osman Nagar, Moula Ali and Banjara Hills.Owaisi said all of them were promised jobs in Thailand but were instead taken to the border region and forced into labour. He urged the Centre to act urgently to ensure their safe return.Speaking to PTI on Friday, the mother of one such youth said her son travelled to Thailand on a visit visa after being promised a job that would later be converted into a work visa. She said the interview was conducted through a social media platform.“After reaching there, he was blindfolded and taken to a different city. He was not even aware where he was taken.He was tortured there and made to work for 18–20 hours,” she said. According to her, her son and others were denied food and rest, and were beaten when they asked to leave.She said she last spoke to her son 10 to 15 days ago, when he described his ordeal. His phone and personal belongings were taken away, and he was allowed to use a phone only once a week.The woman said she had approached Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi for help in rescuing her son, but expressed fear that he could face more harassment if his name appeared in the media.A relative of another Hyderabad youth also spoke about a similar situation and appealed for immediate intervention to secure his release.The concerns come amid earlier reports of similar cases from Telangana. Last week, six people from Armoor in Nizamabad district, including a young couple, were brought back to Hyderabad after being allegedly trafficked to Myawaddy in Myanmar, a known cybercrime hub.The Telangana Cyber Security Bureau registered a case after one of the victims complained that he was promised a data entry job in Thailand but was smuggled across the border and forced to work in online scam operations. The victims alleged their passports were seized, they were beaten for missing targets, and were asked to pay money to be released.Officials said 17 victims from Myanmar have returned to Telangana so far.","Families of Hyderabad youths allegedly trapped along Myanmar–Thailand border have made an urgent appeal to MEA and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

What unfolded earlier

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday asked a Jharkhand-based lawyer to tender an unconditional apology before the Jharkhand High Court over a viral courtroom exchange in which he allegedly told a judge, “Don’t cross the limit”.A bench of chief justice Surya Kant and justice Joymalya Bagchi asked the lawyer to submit an affidavit of unconditional apology before a five-judge bench of the high court that had issued a contempt notice against him in October last year. The Supreme Court also told the high court to consider the apology “sympathetically”.The top court took note of the lawyer’s challenge to the high court’s suo motu contempt proceedings. While hearing the matter, the bench recorded that the lawyer had explained he did not intend to disrespect the judge or obstruct judicial proceedings. His senior counsel told the court that the lawyer was “extremely repentant” and willing to offer an unconditional apology.“Having regard to the above-mentioned stand, we dispose of this with liberty to the petitioner to submit an affidavit of unconditional apology before the high court.We request the high court to consider the apology sympathetically,” the bench said in its order.However, the judges also expressed concern over the lawyer’s conduct. The chief justice questioned why the lawyer could not explain his position directly before the high court judges and described his behaviour as defiant.CJI Surya Kant remarked, ""“Why cannot he explain this before the judges? This is his obstinate character. Let him face them… let him explain. If he wants to show eyes there… let him show and then we will see. We know how to deal with this.Justice Joymalya Bagchi also spoke about declining courtroom decorum, saying friction was increasingly becoming a matter of “professional pride” at different levels of the judiciary.During the hearing, senior advocate Siddharth Dave, appearing for the lawyer, said live-streamed court proceedings had created new challenges and that even a notice could damage a lawyer’s career.The controversy began on October 16 last year during a hearing before justice Rajesh Kumar of the Jharkhand High Court. The lawyer was representing a client seeking restoration of an electricity connection.Justice Kumar reportedly made observations about the lawyer’s manner of argument and asked the chairman of the Jharkhand state bar council to take cognisance of his conduct. The lawyer then approached the bench, said he would argue “in his own way”, and told the judge, “Don’t cross the limit”.Clips from the live-streamed proceedings later went viral on social media. A five-judge bench of the Jharkhand high court, led by then chief Justice Tarlok Singh Chauhan, subsequently took suo motu cognisance of the matter and issued a contempt notice to the lawyer.",The Supreme Court has asked a Jharkhand-based lawyer to tender an unconditional apology.

Stalin counters PM, raises pending demands

Tight security, alliance show of strength

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said the people of Tamil Nadu have decided to bid farewell to the “corrupt” DMK government in the upcoming Assembly elections, as he kicked off the NDA ’s campaign in the state.Chief Minister M K Stalin strongly countered the remarks, accusing the BJP-led NDA of repeatedly betraying Tamil Nadu.Ahead of a mega rally at Maduranthakam in Chengalpattu district, PM Modi said the NDA’s governance record and commitment to regional aspirations were resonating with voters.“Tamil Nadu is with NDA… Tamil Nadu has decided that it’s time to bid farewell to the corrupt DMK government. The NDA’s governance record and commitment to regional aspirations are striking a chord with the people of the state,” PM Modi said in a post on X.The Maduranthakam rally marks the formal launch of the NDA’s Assembly election campaign. AIADMK general secretary Edappadi K Palaniswami and other NDA leaders are expected to share the stage with PM Modi.BJP Tamil Nadu election in-charge Piyush Goyal said the rally was the first step towards ending what he called the DMK’s “corruption-ridden government,” as per news agency PTI.Reacting sharply, Chief Minister M K Stalin said PM Modi visits Tamil Nadu only during election season and accused the Centre of ignoring key state demands.“Tamil Nadu counts the betrayals of NDA. Prime Minister Modi comes to Tamil Nadu only when the election season comes,” Stalin said in a post on X.Stalin questioned when Tamil Nadu would receive the pending Rs 3,458 crore under the Samagra Shiksha scheme, when assurances on delimitation would be given, and when the “anarchy” of the Governor would end.He also flagged delays in MGNREGA payments, the AIIMS Madurai project, disaster relief funds, metro rail proposals for Coimbatore and Madurai, and reiterated the state’s demand for NEET exemption.Security has been tightened in Maduranthakam ahead of the Prime Minister’s visit, with elaborate arrangements including a helicopter landing facility in neighbouring Chengalpattu district, officials said, as per PTI.The rally is being projected by the NDA as a show of unity, with leaders from alliance parties attending, as the BJP intensifies its push against the ruling DMK in the run-up to the Tamil Nadu Assembly elections.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi kicks off NDA campaign in Tamil Nadu.

IMPHAL: A Meitei man visiting his Kuki fiancee in Manipur's hill district of Churachandpur was abducted and shot dead on camera Wednesday evening, a killing that jolted the state with graphic footage, street protests and an order for an NIA probe.M Rishikanta, 31, was allegedly dragged away by armed miscreants from his fiancee's home at Tuibong village in Churachandpur district southwest of Imphal around 6.30pm. Police said his body was found hours later near Natjang village in the same district. A case has been registered and search operations launched.Rishikanta worked as a technical engineer in Nepal, family members said. He had arrived before Christmas and had been staying in Churachandpur since Dec 19. The couple had sought permission from Kuki National Organisation, an umbrella group of Kuki insurgent outfits, for his stay. KNO denied knowledge of the visit and any role in the killing.A video circulated widely on social media showed his final moments, with the gunmen shooting him twice despite his pleas. The clip carried a message reading: ""No Peace, No Popular Government.""An autopsy was conducted Thursday in Churachandpur.Family members identified the body over a video call, unable to travel to the hill district amid security concerns. Kakching police facilitated the process, and the body was to be handed over later in the day.Manipur has remained deeply fractured since ethnic violence erupted in May 2023 between Meiteis and Kuki-Zo tribal communities, leaving communities effectively sealed off from one another. Even now, civilians rarely cross into areas identified with rival groups. Periodic flare-ups such as the one in Churachandpur keep the state on edge.Protests erupted Thursday at Kakching Khunou, Rishikanta's native village in Kakching district, where residents blocked an arterial road. To douse tensions, Governor AK Bhalla told a delegation of a Joint Action Committee led by Lok Sabha MP Angomcha Bimol Akoijam that the case would be handed to NIA for a ""thorough and impartial"" inquiry, according to an official release.The governor further said that intensive combing operations were under way ""on a war footing"", with coordinated deployment of state and central forces to track those responsible.JAC urged steps to prevent similar killings, called for intensified action against armed Kuki militants in the hills, and sought disciplinary action against Churachandpur's police chief and central forces deployed there, alleging failure to take preventive measures.","M Rishikanta, 31, was allegedly dragged away by armed miscreants.

'Bibi, Stop Taking Credit': Trump Humiliates Israeli PM At Davos; Calls Out Israeli Iron Dome 'Lie'

US President Donald Trump on Thursday said the United States is set to receive around $600 billion in tariff revenue, adding that the figure is expected to be “much more than that” next year.Trump made the remarks while addressing the World Economic Forum (WEF) Summit in Davos, where he also highlighted what he described as an unprecedented surge in investments flowing into the country.Linking the rise in investment to the November 5 election outcome, Trump said it had brought clarity about his administration’s tariff policy. “We're doing numbers in terms of people investing in the United States as we've never had before,” he said, adding that tariffs were aimed at protecting the country, which he claimed had been taken advantage of for years.Trump noted that the estimated $600 billion in tariff revenue does not include investments by countries and companies setting up operations in the US. “We'll have, I'd say, $600 billion worth of tariff money coming in. And I think we're going to have maybe more than that. By next year, it'll be much more than that,” he said.Highlighting corporate investments, Trump said Apple is spending $650 billion in the US, calling it a major commitment, and added that Toyota has also announced plans to invest in the country, according to news agency ANI.Recalling a meeting in Japan, he said Toyota’s leadership had confirmed the investment plans as part of a broader trend of global companies expanding their US footprint.Calling the developments “amazing,” Trump said, “We've never had anything like it or close,” adding that no other country was witnessing similar investment momentum.He claimed that from an investment perspective, people were in “great shape” and many investors were making substantial money.In Davos, Trump also waived tariffs planned on European allies following what he described as a framework deal over Greenland, though no details of the agreement were disclosed.",US President Donald Trump on Thursday said the United States is set to receive around $600 billion in tariff revenue next year.

Indian-American investors and advocacy groups came together to shred Texas woman Sara Gonzales's massive H-1B expose to pieces and asserted that she has no idea how the H-1B staffing works in the US. In her viral video, Gonzales targeted two companies: 3Bees Technologies and Qubitz Tech Systems, and claimed that these two companies hired H-1Bs but when she visited the addresses, she found no office, no work.Indian American Advocacy Council co-founder Rajeev Sharma said it is completely legal to start a business listing the home address, the way Apple, Google, Amazon and Disney did. Legal immigrants trying to work should not be harassed, Sharma said, adding that Gonzales herself might be in the US illegally.Gonzales visited the house of Hari Madiraju, the visa contact person for Qubitz and asked whether the 12 H-1B workers that he hired were working from his house. Hari called 911 and said: ""Somebody is knocking on my door and then they are like threatening me. ... Please, can you help me?""The video stirred a strong reaction from 'America First' activists who questioned if Hari did not do anything wrong, why he did not clarify it and why he instead called the police. James Blunt, a US-based entrepreneur, said Gonzales does not understand how the H-1B works. Staffing companies hiring H-1Bs on behalf of IT companies is legal and an established practise. ""Contracting workers out to end clients is not a red flag—it’s the backbone of staffing and consulting. This is explicitly allowed and commonplace. Calling it “weird” doesn’t make it illegal; it just makes her uninformed,"" Blunt wrote.Gonzales said the phone numbers listed on the 3Bees Technologies website are all Indian numbers and the address mentioned is in Telangana, India. The director, president and agent of the company was listed as Vamsi Krishna Vajinapally, Gonzales said.","Texas woman Sara Gonzales made a viral video about H-1B staffing companies.

Denmark To Cede Greenland To Trump? ‘Angers’ Putin & Xi, Backs Permanent NATO Presence In Arctic

What is 'nihilist penguin'?





As Donald Trump sharpens his focus on the Arctic island, the White House has reinforced its messaging by sharing a representative, AI-generated image that taps into the viral “nihilist penguin” trend, showing the US president walking alongside a penguin in Greenland, a symbolic move amplifying his Greenland pitch.The image, posted on X by the White House, shows Trump in an overcoat traversing a snowy Greenland landscape with a penguin holding the US flag, while the mountains ahead displayed a Greenland flag. Footprints in the snow trail the two as they walk together, underscoring Washington’s renewed emphasis on the strategic Arctic territory.Days earlier, Trump had shared another AI-generated image depicting Greenland as a US territory, with JD Vance and Marco Rubio alongside him as he plants the American flag—an image that further reinforced his assertive Greenland pitch.Primarily known as the “Nihilist Penguin” meme, also dubbed the “Lonely Penguin” or “Wandering Penguin”—the viral clip originates from German filmmaker Werner Herzog ’s 2007 documentary on Antarctica. While it has circulated online for nearly two decades, it has only recently crystallised into a full-fledged meme.The scene shows a lone, seemingly disoriented penguin breaking away from its colony and heading toward the Antarctic interior, with distant mountains on the horizon.In the film, Herzog himself describes the journey as an ominous, one-way march—framed as a path leading almost certainly to death.Trump has repeatedly argued that Greenland should be absorbed into US territory for “security purposes,” citing concerns that allowing Russia or China closer access to the region could pose long-term strategic risks. His remarks have triggered sharp backlash from several countries, including key NATO members.In a separate post on Truth Social, Trump lashed out at Canada for opposing his proposed “Golden Dome” missile defence project over Greenland. He warned that Beijing could “eat them up” within a year, accusing Ottawa of choosing closer economic ties with China over US-backed security guarantees.“Canada is against The Golden Dome being built over Greenland, even though The Golden Dome would protect Canada. Instead, they voted in favour of doing business with China, who will ‘eat them up’ within the first year!” Trump wrote.He also addressed security and strategic concerns in the Arctic, marking an apparent U-turn from his earlier rhetoric about seizing Greenland or using tariffs as leverage against European allies.According to ABC News, negotiations over Greenland’s future will continue in the coming days and weeks, with delegations from the United States, Denmark, Greenland and NATO set to work out the contours of a potential deal.","The White House has shared a representative, AI-generated image that taps into the viral “nihilist penguin” trend.

What are the key contentions





US President Donald Trump has launched a fresh attack on Canada, accusing Ottawa of opposing his proposed “Golden Dome” missile defence system over Greenland while choosing to deepen economic ties with China.In a post on his social media platform Truth Social on Friday (local time), Trump said, “Canada is against The Golden Dome being built over Greenland, even though The Golden Dome would protect Canada.” He added, “Instead, they voted in favor of doing business with China, who will ‘eat them up’ within the first year!”Responding to the claims made by Trump, Canadian ambassador to the US Kirsten Hillman told CBS News, ""Canada is investing over $80 billion over the next 5 years in our defense systems.”""When we have talked to the President about protecting our hemisphere, we have talked about ways in which our different capabilities can work together so that we have eyes on the region,"" Hillman said.The comments mark the latest escalation in Trump’s increasingly personal criticism of America’s northern neighbour, bringing together defence policy, trade competition and long-running bilateral tensions and border issues.Trump’s remarks come days after Canadian PM Mark Carney’s visit to Beijing, aimed at reviving economic engagement with China, Canada’s second-largest trading partner after the United States. And Carney’s blistering attack on the US and West at large in his address in Davos.The visit resulted in an agreement to cut tariffs on certain Canadian agricultural products and set quotas for Chinese electric vehicles entering Canada. The deal could also see more Chinese investments in Canada.As the first Canadian leader to visit China in a decade, there were talks of “new world order” between him and Chinese premier Xi Jinping, who hailed the ""turnaround"" in their relationship. Talking about the deal Carney appeared to allude to Trump tariffs as a factor, telling reporters that Canada's relationship with China had been more ""predictable"" in recent months and that he found talks with Beijing ""realistic and respectful"".Trump when asked about the renewed engagement, he signaled his approval. “It’s OK. That’s what he should be doing,” he said.Speaking earlier this week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trump reiterated that the Golden Dome missile defence system would inherently extend protection to Canada.“We’re building a Golden Dome that’s going to, just by its very nature, be defending Canada,” he told attendees. “Canada gets a lot of freebies from us, by the way. They should be grateful also.”Trump went further, asserting that Canada’s security depends entirely on Washington. “Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements,” he said, referring to Carney.The Canadian Prime Minister responded directly to Trump rejecting his claims.“Canada doesn’t live because of the United States. Canada thrives because we are Canadian,” Carney said after returning from Davos. Emphasising sovereignty, he added, “We are masters in our home. This is our own country. It’s our future. The choice is up to us.”At Davos, Carney had warned against coercion by major powers toward smaller nations, without naming Trump. He called for “middle-powers” to unite and warned against an US-led global system that was “merely evolving but breaking apart.” Back in Canada, he said the country could still demonstrate that “another way is possible” amid rising authoritarianism.The exchange sharpened further after Trump announced he was withdrawing an invitation for Carney to join what he called his “Board of Peace.”Trump has repeatedly floated the idea of Canada becoming the 51st US state and recently posted an altered map showing Canada, Greenland, Venezuela and Cuba as part of US territory.It came as after American operation in Venezuela to capture its leader Nicolas Maduro, Trump has renewed his aggressive push to wrest control of Greenland, which he says is “strategically important to US national security.”Trump has also insisted that Canada wants to be part of the Golden Dome system, which he says should be fully operational before the end of his term in 2029. However, Canada’s ambassador to the United Nations, Bob Rae, described the proposal as resembling a “protection racket.”The Golden Dome plan envisions a US-controlled missile defence shield using space-based sensors, interceptors and advanced technologies. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent said Greenland is “strategically important” to the project and told CNBC that Canada had been invited to participate – “if they want to pay their share.”The Trump administration has estimated the system’s cost at about $175 billion. The Congressional budget office warned in a report that space-based interceptors alone could cost between $161 billion and $542 billion over the next two decades.",US President Donald Trump has launched a fresh attack on Canada. He accused Ottawa of opposing his proposed “Golden Dome” missile defence system over Greenland. He said Ottawa chose to deepen economic ties with China instead. The comments mark the latest escalation in Trump’s increasingly personal criticism of Canada.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127354901,imgsize-521853,width-400,resizemode-4/mark-carney-and-donald-trump-file.jpg"

About Trump’s Board of Peace





US President Donald Trump has reacted cautiously but positively to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s suggestion that he could use frozen Russian assets to pay for entry into Trump’s proposed “Board of Peace”.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One while returning from the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos on Thursday, Trump said he was open to the idea if the funds were Putin’s own.Asked whether he would allow Putin to use frozen Russian assets for the contribution, Trump said, “I don't know about that. I mean, I've heard that.” After the reporter clarified that the comment came from Putin himself, Trump responded, “Very interesting. But he said he's going to use his money. His money. I think that's fine.”Trump added that Putin had indicated he would contribute $1 billion to join the Board of Peace.“He's going to join the Board of Peace and he's going to make a contribution of a billion dollars by using his money. I mean, if he's using his money, that's great. I think it's important to have everybody,” Trump said.Earlier, Putin suggested that Russia could contribute $1 billion from Russian assets currently frozen in the United States to Trump’s Board of Peace.He also said frozen funds could later be used to rebuild Ukrainian regions after a peace treaty is signed.Putin said the proposal had been discussed with Washington and would be taken up during talks with Trump’s envoys in Moscow.Also read: Ahead of Russia-Ukraine-US talks, Kremlin lays down ‘very important condition’ — what is it

Trump signed the charter of the Board of Peace at Davos on Thursday, with permanent membership likely requiring a $1 billion contribution.The body was initially tasked to oversee peace efforts linked to Gaza but is not limited to the region, raising concerns that it could function as a parallel forum to the United Nations.Around 35 world leaders have confirmed participation so far, with strong backing from several Middle Eastern countries, while key US allies such as France and the United Kingdom have expressed doubts and opted to stay away for now.",US President Donald Trump has reacted cautiously but positively to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s suggestion that he could use frozen Russian assets.

MUMBAI: After Bombay high court's rap for not arresting Mahad election violence accused Vikas Gogawale, son of cabinet minister Bharat Gogawale of Shiv Sena , the state said he will surrender on Friday.""Today I read in the newspaper this minister is going to hoist the flag on Jan 26. This minister is given that honour. Why? He is a cabinet minister ..., and his son is absconding. Police are not able to arrest him... all political,"" said Justice Madhav Jamdar.""The position on record clearly shows the rule of law in Maharashtra is adversely affected...

On Dec 23, his anticipatory bail plea was rejected by the HC.Advocate general Milind Sathe told Justice Madhav Jamdar that “he (Gogawale) said he will ensure he (Vikas) connects with him and he will ask him to follow the law. He will try to connect with him so keep it tomorrow.” The judge asked, “Connect and what?’’ Sathe replied, “with the son.” “And then what?” the judge further asked, “Then he will surrender,” Sathe said.HC was hearing the anticipatory bail plea of Shreeyash Jagtap, son of former NCP MLA Manik Jagtap. Cross FIRs were filed over the Dec 2 incident. While one person named Vikas, his cousin Mahesh and their supporters, a second named Jagtap and his supporters. On Dec 29, HC granted Jagtap interim protection from arrest. On Jan 17, the state filed an affidavit that in spite of best efforts by the police, Vikas could not be arrested.Sathe said, “we’ll put it to a logical conclusion and a non-bailable warrant will be issued”. “So this is the position of rule of law in the state of Maharashtra? The person is the minister’s son and the minister is still in the cabinet. This is political,” said Justice Jamdar. Sathe said the next step was the declaration of proclamation.“If the government wishes, it can arrest anybody within 24 hours. If it doesn’t want to arrest, then they (govt) will file an affidavit,” said Justice Jamdar. Sathe said “that is not the intention, adding; “I’ll show how many persons are deployed for this job. The SP is personally monitoring.”Jagtap’s advocate said Gogawale told a news channel his son is not absconding and is in contact with him. “The position on record clearly shows the rule of law in the state of Maharashtra is adversely affected,” said Justice Jamdar. He questioned why Gogawale’s statement is not recorded “as to where is his son.”When Sathe said obviously Vikas “is somewhere…”, Justice Jamdar said “and his father continues to be the cabinet minister. “The chief minister is so helpless he can’t do anything about that. I will make an observation (in the order). It is about administration of justice,’’ added Justice Jamdar.Jagtap’s advocate pointed out Mahesh, who is also absconding, filed his nomination for Zilla Parishad election. Sathe said he filed it though a proposer.The judge asked Sathe to take instructions “from the minister” and “the chief minister also” and inform the court at 5pm.“I will pass an appropriate order. I will not be bound by any pressure…All are citizens. There are no special citizens,” he said. After Sathe’s statement, he kept the matter for 11am on Friday, adding, “before that ask him to surrender also.” Justice Jamdar told Jagtap’s advocate once “he (Vikas) surrenders, your protection goes.”","Vikas Gogawale, an accused in the Dec 2 violence that broke out between NCP and Shiv Sena supporters during Mahad Municipal Council elections, will surrender on Friday.

Drain left open to kill again? Winter rain exposes Delhi’s civic negligence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/drain-left-open-to-kill-again-winter-rain-exposes-delhis-civic-negligence/articleshow/127359256.cms,"





NEW DELHI: A year-and-a-half after a mother and her three-year-old son drowned in an open drain near Ghazipur in east Delhi, the hazard remains unchanged continuing to overflow and threaten lives, with winter rain in Delhi on Thursday once again exposing the civic negligence.The drain, which flooded after the rain, continued to emit a foul stench, not to mention the daily risk, particularly for children walking to and from school.“We can’t even stand here because of the smell from this overflowing drain. Our daughters are risking their lives every day just to come back from school,” said Sushma Kumari, a resident of the area.On July 31, 2024, Tanuja Bisht (23) and her son, Priyansh, died after falling into the 1.5-foot-deep, waterlogged open drain amid heavy rain.The tragedy unfolded when the mother tried to rescue her child; their bodies were later found hours apart, still holding hands.The incident had sparked a major war of words between Delhi Development Authority and Municipal Corporation of Delhi, with both agencies disputing jurisdiction over the unbarricaded drain.The drain lies between Uttar Pradesh’s Khoda Colony and Delhi’s Mayur Vihar Phase-III. Most children from the area attend three Delhi govt schools in Kalyanpuri and Kondli. Residents say the drain becomes a recurring danger during every seasonal spell of rain.Incidentally, merely 10 days before the tragedy, MCD had assured Delhi High Court that it had started repair work in the area. More than a year later, the situation on ground tells another story.","On July 31, 2024, Tanuja Bisht (23) and her son, Priyansh, died after falling into the 1.5-foot-deep, waterlogged open drain amid heavy rain.

Immigrant visa ban list

Immigrant visa vs non-immigrant visa





The pause of immigrant visas from 75 countries that started from January 21 may add around 50,000 employment-based Green Card quotas in 2027 as family-based Green Card quotas pass on to employment-based the next year if they (family-based) remain unused. This is the only positive takeaway for Green Card applicants from the pause on 75 countries. Immigration experts explained that this happened during Covid also, and as a result, the Priority Dates moved up to 4-5 years.Immigration attorney Emily Neumann said she went through the data of all the countries mentioned on the 75-country list to check how much family-based Green Card quotas they had to calculate how much spillover can be expected next year for employment-based categories. About 67,000 immigrant visas would have been allotted to these 75 countries in the current fiscal year, had the ban not been announced, but as the ban came into effect after the first quarter of this fiscal year (starting from October 1), there would be 50,000 spillover Green Cards if the ban on these 75 countries continue through this fiscal year ending in September 2026.Citing 2024 data, Neumann confirmed that Pakistan had the highest number of family-based Green Card quota (15,000), followed by Bangladesh (8000).Both countries have been put on the immigrant visa ban list.The Trump administration announced a list of 75 countries from which it won't process any immigration visa requests as of now. This ban would be in place until the administration reassesses how much welfare benefits these nationals are using. The list includes: Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Antigua and Barbuda, Armenia, Azerbaijan, the Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belarus, Belize, Bhutan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Colombia, Côte d’Ivoire, Cuba, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Dominica, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Fiji, The Gambia, Georgia, Ghana, Grenada, Guatemala, Guinea, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Jamaica, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, North Macedonia, Moldova, Mongolia, Montenegro, Morocco, Myanmar, Nepal, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Republic of the Congo, Russia, Rwanda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda, Uruguay, Uzbekistan, and Yemen.The ban is only on immigrant visa which is sought by people who want to live permanently in the US.

JHANSI: A 13-year-old boy, who had been kidnapped, was found dead in Uttar Pradesh’s Chitrakoot district Friday, his body stuffed inside a suitcase. Police shot his two kidnappers when they allegedly tried to escape during the recovery of the crime weapon; one of them died on the way to hospital.Ayush Kesarwani, a Class 7 student and resident of Bangar area, went missing Thursday evening. Around 8.30pm, his father Ashok, a cloth merchant, received a call from an unknown number demanding Rs 40 lakh ransom.Police said the accused, Irfan (28) and Kallu (22), had called Ashok using a cellphone stolen from a relative. Both were natives of Prayagraj who had relocated a year ago; they ran a shop making tin boxes and trunks.They had been Ashok’s tenants until he kicked them out in Sept last year for alleged shady behaviour. Apparently nursing agrudge, the duo moved into a nearby house and lured Ayush to their accommodation.A distraught Ashok alerted cops, and police personnel from around 10 police stations, along with SOG and SWAT teams, carried out a frantic search. Technical surveillance teams traced the cellphone used to make the ransom call and zeroed in on the accused before they could switch the device off, destroy evidence, or flee.After an overnight search, the kidnappers were caught early Friday. They confessed to having murdered Ayush, stuffing his body in a suitcase and burying it near his residence.“The accused were taken to a nearby jungle where the stolen cellphone was recovered. They constantly tried to mislead us about the body’s location. In between, they snatched the gun from police and opened fire. In retaliatory firing, both were injured. When they were taken to the hospital, Kallu was declared dead, while Irfan was referred to a higher centre in Prayagraj,” Chitrakoot SP Arun Kumar Singh said.Kallu had a murder case and two other cases registered in the past in Prayagraj Commissionerate.The crime sparked protests in the area, with thousands of angry residents staging a dharna, blocking the national highway for hours and raising slogans demanding harsh punishment for the accused, including ‘bulldozer justice’. The protesters demanded compensation and a govt job for the kin of the deceased, along with an assurance that they would not be booked for blocking the NH.Senior police and administrative officials reached the spot and appealed to the agitators to vacate the area, assuring them of proper action.","Ayush Kesarwani, a Class 7 student and resident of Bangar area, went missing Thursday evening.

"Periodic table meets Shakespeare: University appoints chemistry professor HOD of English; how will science teacher handle English students, asks Gujarat HC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/periodic-table-meets-shakespeare-univ-appoints-chemistry-prof-hod-of-eng/articleshow/127322089.cms,"





AHMEDABAD: The decision of Hemchandracharya North Gujarat University (HNGU) to appoint a chemistry professor as the in-charge head of its English department ended up in combustion triggering multiple litigations and a fuming court questioning the university--how a science teacher would address academic concerns of English literature students? The HNGU was forced to reverse the decision even as the court allowed aggrieved party to knock on appropriate doors for further justice.The issue arose after the retirement of former HOD of English, Adesh Pal, in June last year, when the university appointed Kokilaben Parmar, a faculty member in the chemistry department, as in-charge HOD of English. The appointment was challenged by Hetal Patel, a faculty member in the English department, who approached the Education Tribunal.HNGU's advocate, Meet Shah, defended the university's decision, submitting that the seniority of faculty members in the English department was yet to be ascertained. He said Parmar was tasked to look after only administrative affairs of the department. He also questioned Patel's application in the tribunal, arguing it was not a service matter but only the university's administrative decision for a temporary arrangement.On Oct 10, 2025, the tribunal stayed HNGU's decision to appoint a chemistry faculty member as English HOD. Parmar then approached the high court, challenging the stay on the grounds that she was not heard by the tribunal before it stayed her appointment as HOD of English.A week later, the high court stayed the tribunal's order.The university also challenged the tribunal's decision, citing the tribunal's jurisdiction to entertain Patel's application, which it said was not a service matter. Patel's counsel submitted that the university ignored the rules and neglected her in appointing the chemistry faculty member as in-charge HOD.During a hearing on Tuesday, Justice Nirzar Desai questioned the university on how chemistry could address academic concerns of a student of English literature. The university could not reply to the court's query, but said Parmar's role was restricted to administrative decisions only. However, the court continued to question how an HOD not well versed in the subject could help a student.On Friday, the university produced a draft order to replace the chemistry teacher with a faculty member of the English department, Tapal Chakrabarty. The university clarified that it could not replace Parmar as in-charge HOD with somebody else due to the high court's stay order. Patel objected to the proposal as well, citing the rules of appointment and seniority.Following HNGU's new decision, Parmar and the university withdrew their petitions. On Patel's grievance regarding Chakrabarty as the new choice, the High Court said, ""…it shall be open for respondent No. 3, Ms. Patel, to challenge the same before the appropriate authority in accordance with law.""","Hemchandracharya North Gujarat University (HNGU) appointed a chemistry professor as the in-charge head of its English department.

This is why everything is on high alert in Iran,” a senior Iranian official said on condition of anonymity, as cited by the Times of Israel.“This time we will treat any attack limited, unlimited, surgical, kinetic, whatever they call it, as an all-out war against us, and we will respond in the hardest way possible to settle this.”The warning comes as tensions remain high following US-backed Israeli strikes in June aimed at degrading Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. President Donald Trump confirmed the deployment of a “massive fleet” toward Iran, telling reporters aboard Air Force One that Washington is watching Tehran closely. “We’re watching Iran,” Trump said. “I’d rather not see anything happen but we’re watching them very closely.The Pentagon has been sending US military assets into the Middle East, including the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and three accompanying destroyers, which left the South China Sea earlier this week. The carrier strike group, currently in the Indian Ocean, will join other US Navy ships in the Persian Gulf and Bahrain, bringing roughly 5,700 additional service members to the region.Central Command has also deployed F-15E Strike Eagles, while the UK Ministry of Defence sent Typhoon jets to Qatar “in a defensive capacity.” Analysts have noted dozens of US military cargo planes heading toward the region, mirroring last year’s rapid deployments following attacks on Iranian nuclear sites.Trump indicated that the US fleet is “just in case,” leaving open the possibility of military action if Iran escalates, despite recently pulling back from threats over Tehran’s crackdown on protests. “Last year’s strikes on Iranian nuclear sites would look like peanuts if they proceed with planned executions of some protesters,” he warned.The warnings come amid a domestic crisis in Iran, where nationwide protests erupted in late December over economic hardship and political repression. Activists estimate the crackdown has killed at least 5,032 people and detained more than 27,600, far higher than the official toll of 3,117, which includes security forces, civilians, and “US-backed rioters.”Iranian military officials have framed the unrest as linked to foreign intervention. Guards commander General Mohammad Pakpour warned the US and Israel to avoid “miscalculations” and said Iran’s forces “have their finger on the trigger, more prepared than ever, ready to carry out the orders and measures of the supreme commander-in-chief.” General Ali Abdollahi Aliabadi added that if the US attacks, “all US interests, bases and centres of influence” would be “legitimate targets. ”Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian accused the US and Israel of exploiting the protests as “cowardly revenge… for the defeat in the 12-Day War,” while the Revolutionary Guards maintained their readiness for “the hardest response possible.”","US aircraft carrier strike group and other military assets to arrive in Middle East in coming days.

'Avoid Travelling To Iran': Russia Urges Citizens To Avoid Persian Nation As Trump Hints At Strikes

Airlines suspend services to Israel, Gulf hubs

US military build-up raises stakes

Iran protests, disputed death toll





A fresh wave of flight cancellations has hit the Middle East as escalating tensions between the United States and Iran raise fears of a wider military confrontation, forcing major international carriers to suspend or scale back operations across the region.Air France, KLM, Lufthansa and several other airlines cancelled flights to Israel and key Gulf destinations late Friday, citing a worsening security situation, as per aviation news network Air Live.The suspensions, many of which extend through the weekend, have stranded thousands of passengers and disrupted regional air connectivity.According to Air Live, KLM and Air France halted flights not only to Tel Aviv but also to major hubs in the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Qatar.KLM said it cancelled all overnight flights to Israel and the Gulf through Sunday and remains in “close contact with the government” while reviewing safety conditions.Lufthansa Group restricted flights to Israel to daytime operations and extended its avoidance of Iranian and Iraqi airspace, while North American carriers United Airlines and Air Canada scrapped scheduled services to Tel Aviv for Friday and Saturday.As per Times of Israel, Air France and KLM have cancelled flights to Israel, Dubai and Saudi Arabia until at least Sunday due to “security tensions in the region”. Lufthansa Group had already suspended night-time flights to Israel until at least the end of January.Last week, Iran had temporarily closed its airspace for nearly five hours amid concerns over possible US military action, forcing airlines to cancel, reroute or delay flights. Several carriers, including IndiGo and Air India, had said their international services were impacted, while Lufthansa and ITA Airways confirmed they would bypass Iranian and Iraqi airspace and suspend night flights to Tel Aviv.Aviation risk groups warned that missile and drone activity in the region posed a serious threat to civil aviation.The flight disruptions come as Washington ramps up its military presence in the Middle East.The Pentagon has been sending additional US assets into the region, including an aircraft carrier group and thousands of troops, as per news agency AP.US President Donald Trump has said an American “armada” is heading towards Iran, renewing warnings over Tehran’s handling of protests and its nuclear programme.“We have a massive fleet heading in that direction, and maybe we won’t have to use it,” US President Donald Trump told reporters, saying the deployment was precautionary.The aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and accompanying destroyers are heading towards the region and are expected to join existing US naval assets in the Persian Gulf and Bahrain.“We have a lot of ships going that direction, just in case… I’d rather not see anything happen, but we’re watching them very closely,” Trump told reporters.Additional US Air Force F-15E Strike Eagle jets and military cargo aircraft have also been deployed, while the UK has sent Typhoon fighter jets to Qatar in a defensive role.The geopolitical escalation is unfolding against the backdrop of a severe crackdown on protests in Iran.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) said it has confirmed the deaths of 5,002 people, including 4,714 protesters, during recent demonstrations, while noting that the actual toll could be far higher due to a prolonged internet shutdown, reported news agency AFP.Iranian authorities have given a much lower official figure of 3,117 deaths, a number rights groups have disputed. HRANA said at least 26,852 people have been arrested, while Norway-based Iran Human Rights warned the final death toll could reach 25,000.Iran has rejected US claims that pressure from Washington halted planned executions of protesters, with its prosecutor general calling the assertion “completely false”.","Air France, KLM, Lufthansa and several other airlines cancelled flights to Israel and key Gulf destinations late Friday.

What happened on Dubai's E311

Khamenei's Days Numbered? Trump Demands Decisive War Options, Pentagon Sends More Firepower To Iran

The mounting Dubai hospital bill and why it matters

Road safety on UAE highways: Beyond one crash

Insurance gaps and expat realities in Dubai and other UAE cities

What this means for road users in the UAE





An Indian expatriate in Dubai is confronting an overwhelming hospital bill of nearly Dh400,000 (approximately Rs 1 crore) after a serious motorbike accident on Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Road (E311) left him with multiple fractures and ongoing surgical needs. The situation raises broader questions about road safety, healthcare costs and insurance coverage in the UAE.On the early morning of January 18, 2026, 36-year-old Avinash Sequeira, a freelance events professional and member of the Ducati Owners Club, was on a routine weekend ride with friends when the accident occurred near Liwan, close to his home. After swapping bikes, due to a radiator leak on his own motorcycle, Avinash was heading home at around 50 km/h when the bike lost traction on a gentle curve, causing him to crash.He sustained multiple fractures to both legs and his right hip, according to medical reports. Passersby called emergency services and he was rushed to Fakeeh University Hospital for emergency trauma care. Avinash has since undergone two major surgeries to stabilise his injuries, including the insertion of steel rods in his femur and hip and faces two more surgeries, including reconstruction of the tibia below his right knee.Doctors have estimated a long recovery, months of rehabilitation before he can walk again and possibly further medical care beyond that.Without medical insurance, the costs of Avinash’s emergency care and surgeries have rapidly escalated to nearly Dh400,000, a figure that has alarmed his family and friends. Avinash’s father, Sunil Sequeira, told reporters that the family cannot afford the expenses. They were alerted to his crash when his iPhone automatically sent out an SOS alert, leading to prompt medical attention but also to soaring hospital bills.This story highlights a growing concern among many residents in the UAE: the high cost of emergency medical care for those without comprehensive health insurance, a gap that can place families under immense financial stress after accidents or sudden injuries. In some cases, expatriates have shared on local forums that lack of insurance coverage led to difficult negotiations over hospital deposits or bills in the tens of thousands for relatively minor injuries.While each accident has its own unique circumstances, Dubai Police and traffic authorities have repeatedly warned about the risks of fatigue, conditions, and behaviour on major roads such as E311 and Sheikh Zayed Road (E11). In late 2025, Dubai Police issued a public warning emphasising the dangers of fatigue driving, noting that even healthy drivers can lose control if they are unwell or overly tired, leading to high-speed collisions and serious injuries.Officers urged motorists to take regular breaks and ensure they are fully fit to drive, especially on long stretches like those on E311 and other arterial highways. Additionally, authorities have cracked down on reckless riding and high-speed behaviour, warning that passengers’ lives and riders’ own safety are at risk when traffic laws are ignored.For example, Dubai Police have arrested bikers travelling at speeds as high as 280–300 km/h on major roads, enforcing fines up to Dh50,000 and impounding vehicles to discourage dangerous conduct.The Indian biker’s lack of medical insurance underscores a broader challenge in the UAE and other Gulf States: while employers must provide health coverage for many workers, freelancers and contract workers are not always insured, especially if they work independently or under short-term arrangements. This situation is not unique. Online community posts from UAE residents reveal frequent discussions about surprise hospital costs when people without insurance or with limited plans require emergency treatment, from fractures to emergency scans or surgeries.Lack of insurance can also influence where and how patients are admitted and how expenses are handled by hospitals. The Sequeira family has appreciated the medical care and the quick response by emergency services but the financial burden looms large. They say they are relying on community support and the solidarity of fellow riders and friends as they navigate the mounting bills and long rehabilitation process.This high-cost hospital bill story reflects several intersecting issues in the UAE. For residents, especially those who drive or ride regularly, having comprehensive health and accident insurance can mean the difference between manageable costs and overwhelming financial strain after a crash.Dubai and UAE traffic authorities consistently stress safety measures such as obeying speed limits, staying alert and avoiding fatigue, crucial on high-speed corridors such as E311. A crash like Avinash’s illustrates how quickly routine rides can turn into life-changing events. For many expatriate families, a serious accident brings not just medical bills but time away from work, months of rehab and emotional strain. Friends and colleagues often rally together but the impact is deeply personal and long-lasting.As Avinash continues his recovery and additional surgeries, the road to normalcy is likely to be long and difficult. His case has sparked conversation among bikers and expatriate communities about insurance coverage, road risks and emergency planning for anyone operating vehicles on UAE highways.With serious injuries and steep medical costs and without insurance, families like the Sequeiras can face daunting choices about treatment, finances and long-term care. For residents, the message is clear: stay safe on the roads, ensure proper insurance coverage and be prepared for the unexpected because in a split second, an enjoyable weekend ride can turn into a life-altering accident.","An Indian expatriate in Dubai is confronting an overwhelming hospital bill of nearly Dh400,000 (approximately Rs 1 crore) after a serious motorbike accident.

Discussions to resolve the future of Greenland have focused in recent days on proposals to increase Nato’s presence in the Arctic, give America a sovereign claim to pockets of Greenland’s territory and block potentially hostile adversaries from mining the island’s minerals.Those elements, described by eight senior Western security and diplomatic officials, offer the fullest picture yet of the contours of a potential Greenland compromise that President Trump announced Wednesday without details. His move appeared to at least temporarily defuse an American-made trans-Atlantic crisis over the Danish territory.Critically, the proposals under discussion would stop short of Trump’s goal of transferring ownership of all of Greenland to the US from Denmark, according to the officials, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity. The officials cautioned that many details have yet to be finalised.It is unclear if these discussions will ultimately yield agreement over the territory. Denmark, which publicly opposes ceding ownership of any Greenlandic land, may not agree to the plans on the table. Still, the officials said they were hopeful that they could simultaneously address Trump’s stated concerns about securing the Arctic against possible threats from Russia and China while holding to Europe’s “red line” that Greenland was not for sale.To do that, the proposals would:Create a significant new Nato mission in the Arctic. Multiple officials have dubbed this mission “Arctic Sentry,” in a nod to similarly named Nato missions in the Baltic Sea and Eastern Europe that are meant to counter an increasingly aggressive RussiaUpdate a pact signed between Denmark and the US in 1951. The pact gives the US military wide access to Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory, for operations including the construction and operation of military bases. US officials have said they are concerned that this access could be curbed or ended if Greenland were to obtain independence. Nato officials have discussed expanding the 1951 pact with a new agreement that would effectively create pockets of American soil in the territory.Such an agreement would likely be modelled on a “sovereign base area” agreement in Cyprus, where Britain’s military bases are regarded as British territory. That would give the US greater control over the land than it currently exerts over US embassy sites. Trump and other officials have said that territory in Greenland could prove important for his plans to build a so-called Golden Dome missile defence system for the US, which could include components stationed in Greenland.Restrict non-Nato member countries, particularly Russia and China, from obtaining rights to mine the rare-earth minerals that lie deep under Greenland’s ice sheet.All of those plans have been under discussion inside Nato over the last year, as a direct response to Trump’s stated ambitions.","Proposals would stop short of transferring ownership of all of Greenland to the US from Denmark.

‘Why do you have Indian donors who don’t live here?’: Frisco mayor asked at council meeting,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-do-you-have-indian-donors-who-dont-live-here-frisco-mayor-asked-at-council-meeting/articleshow/127323313.cms,"



A Frisco, Texas, resident posted a video of himself asking mayor Jeff Cheney about his Indian investors at a recent council meeting. The video grabbed social media attention at a time when 'Indians in Texas' emerged as a major issue this week after attorney Aaron Reitz, who is contesting the Texas Attorney General election, spoke against Indians and called them unassimilable.Marc Palasciano, who calls himself a whistleblower, said at the council meeting that he would speak about the “Indian takeover in Frisco and H-1B fraud.”Comparing it with the alleged Somalian fraud in Minnesota, Marc said Frisco’s Indian population exploded by 4,510% over the last 20 years.“From 2% of the population to 33% of the population. As a reminder from the last time I spoke in June and July, let me remind you of the mayor’s donations. In 2021, 10% of donations above $1,000 were from people with Indian last names. In 2023, 55% of donations above $1,000 were from people with Indian last names — a 450% increase in donations above $1,000 from people with Indian last names. That seems like a red flag to me,” Marc said.“Now, let me ask a few questions to the mayor and city council that I don’t expect you guys to answer, but I’m going to ask them anyway. Mayor Cheney, for 2023, why were four of your top donors — Indian people — not living in Frisco or even Collin County and donating $5,000 to you?” he asked, insinuating that these donors were also getting something in return from the mayor.“I don’t understand why someone would donate to a mayor who doesn’t represent them, unless that mayor represents business interests that make them money. I’m sure it’s just a coincidence that all of you are in the real estate business and those four donors have over 158 businesses registered in their name,” Marc said.He then questioned Burt Thakur, the first Indian-origin city council member, about why he used a consulting firm whose CEO, Marc alleged, was convicted of fraud.“Why is one of your biggest donors an Indian in the North Texas real estate business who doesn’t live in Frisco? Why is another one of your biggest donors a white resident in Dallas in real estate? Why does one of your biggest donors have four companies hiring H-1B employees? And why does one of your donors have 23 H-1B companies registered to one address? I’ll end my questions there. We’ll see if your constituents or any news outlets apply pressure and force you guys to answer these questions,” Marc said.","A Frisco, Texas, resident posted a video of himself asking mayor Jeff Cheney about his Indian investors at a recent council meeting.

Ryan Wedding's entry in the crime world

FBI director Kash Patel called Ryan Wedding 'modern day Pablo Escobar' after Wedding was arrested by the FBI in Mexico making this the agency's 500th capture in the history of the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list. ""When you go after a guy like Ryan Wedding, it takes a united front,"" Patel said, also thanking Canadian and Mexican authorities for their help in the investigation.44-year-old Wedding has been on the FBI radar since 2024 March when the FBI added the former Canadian Olympian to their most wanted list. Authorities believe Wedding, 44, is a member of the Sinaloa Cartel and had been hiding in Mexico for more than a decade while running and participating in a transnational drug trafficking operation.Patel said Wedding shipped hundreds of kilograms of cocaine from Colombia, through Mexico and Southern California to the United States and Canada.Attorney General Pam Bondi said Wedding was flown to the US, “where he will face justice.”“Director Patel has worked tirelessly to bring fugitives to justice. We are grateful to our incredible Ambassador Ron Johnson and the Mexican authorities for assisting us in this case,” Bondi said in a post on X.The former athlete was charged in a September 2024 superseding indictment with attempted murder and other counts related to the alleged drug enterprise. In November, a grand jury indictment was unsealed charging him in the death of a federal witness who was supposed to testify against him. The witness was fatally shot at a restaurant after authorities said Wedding “placed a bounty” on his head and used a Canadian website to find the witness and his wife.Prosecutors alleged that Wedding's entry to the drug world took place in 2008 six years after he represented Canada in the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.Wedding traveled to San Diego to buy cocaine, got arrested as the dealer was an undercover agent and he was sentenced to 48 months in federal prison. It was after his release that he started his own criminal drug empire.Wedding made a bold move this January as he surfaced on social media, made his account public and posted images of high-end motorcycles, watches etc.","Ryan Wedding was arrested by the FBI in Mexico making this the agency's 500th capture in the history of the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list.
