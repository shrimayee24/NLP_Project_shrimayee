'They shot down five planes': Donald Trump repeats India-Pakistan ceasefire claim for 25th time; Congress calls it 'silver jubilee',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/they-shot-down-five-planes-donald-trump-repeats-india-pakistan-ceasefire-claim-for-25th-time-congress-calls-it-silver-jubilee/articleshow/122848519.cms,"Donald Trump (AP)

American President Donald Trump on Tuesday night once again claimed credit for helping stop the recent India-Pakistan conflict and said that it was probably going to end up in a ""nuclear war"".""We stopped wars between India and Pakistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda,"" Trump said at a reception in the White House.""They shot down five planes and it was back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. I called them and said, 'Listen, no more trade. If you do this, you're not going to be good…' They're both powerful nuclear nations and that would have happened, and who knows where that would have ended up. And I stopped it,"" the US president added.Moreover, the Congress questioned Prime Minister Modi's silence on Trump's repeated claims, saying that he is finding time only to travel abroad and to destabilise democratic institutions at home. ""As the Modi Govt continues in its refusal to give firm dates for a debate on Pahalgam-Sindoor in Parliament and as the Modi Govt persists in its refusal to commit to a reply by the PM in the debate, President Trump reaches the silver jubilee, the quarter century mark on his claims.He has trumpeted 25 times in the last 73 days but the Prime Minister of India is totally quiet - finding time only to travel abroad and to destabilise democratic institutions at home,"" Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said in a post on X.Earlier, an American diplomat told the UN Security Council on Tuesday that recent ""de-escalations"" between India and Pakistan were facilitated by the United States — a claim that echoes President Donald Trump’s repeated assertions of mediating a ceasefire between the two neighbours, though New Delhi has consistently denied any third-party role.""Across the globe, the United States continues to work with parties to disputes, wherever possible, to find peaceful solutions,"" acting US representative smbassador Dorothy Shea said at a UN Security Council open debate on ‘Multilateralism and Peaceful Settlement of Disputes’. The meeting was chaired by Pakistan’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, as Pakistan holds the rotating presidency of the Council for July.Shea said, ""In the past three months alone, the US leadership has delivered de-escalations between Israel and Iran, between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, and between India and Pakistan.""""The United States, under President Trump’s leadership, played an important role in encouraging the parties to reach these resolutions, which we applaud and support,"" she added.Meanwhile, India's permanent representative to the UN, ambassador Parvathaneni Harish, said that India stopped the military operation at the request of Pakistan. ""On achieving its primary objectives, a cessation of military activities was directly concluded at the request of Pakistan,"" he said.India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and PoK in response to the Pahalgam terror attack on April 22, which killed 26 people. This led to four days of clashes between the two sides, which ended on May 10 after an understanding to stop further military actions.Since May 10, the Trump administration has repeatedly said that the US president ""helped settle"" the conflict between India and Pakistan. Trump has also claimed that he told both countries that the US would engage in ""a lot of trade"" with them if they stopped the conflict. However, New Delhi has consistently rejected these claims, saying that the decision to halt military action was made through bilateral channels, following a call initiated by Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) to his Indian counterpart.Last week, the US designated The Resistance Front as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation and a Specially Designated Global Terrorist. India welcomed the move.","US President Donald Trump on Tuesday night once again claimed credit for helping stop the recent India-Pakistan conflict.

He greeted MPs with a zealous 'Vanakkam' and started the business of the day by calling the first speaker of zero hour.However, proceedings were disrupted following vociferous protests from opposition MPs who trooped into the well when the chair denied admission of a dozen notices to discuss issues ranging from Dhankhar's ""unexpected and unprecedented"" resignation, special revision of electoral rolls in Bihar, Pahalgam terror attack to Operation Sindoor. RS transacted no business during the day amid repeated adjournments.Similar scenes were witnessed in Lok Sabha which saw almost no business amid opposition protests.The corridors of Parliament were abuzz with speculation over Dhankhar's resignation.

Yes, it sends a strong message No, deeper social issues must be addressed





JAIPUR: The brutal murder of a 22-year-old man in Paldi Meena suburb, around 10 km from Jaipur, escalated into widespread protests and unrest, disrupting traffic movement for hours on Jaipur-Agra national highway Monday.The victim, Vipin Kumar, was stabbed around 14 times, allegedly by Mohammad Anas and his associates, late Sunday night in full public view, police said.The protest was finally withdrawn Monday evening after the family's demands for financial compensation, job guarantee and speedy justice were accepted by the administration.Anas, described by police as a ""history-sheeter"" with over a dozen criminal cases against him in Jaipur Commissionerate's Jamdoli police station, allegedly posted on social media claiming ""revenge"" after the attack.The murder sparked outrage, with large crowds gathering Monday morning to protest the killing. Demonstrators attempted multiple road blockades on the national highway, while some protesters targeted and damaged shops allegedly belonging to members of a particular community.Police took swift action and detained accused Mohammad Anas and his five accomplices in the afternoon. During the arrest, Anas allegedly attempted to seize an ASI's service pistol, forcing the police to shoot him in the leg.He was subsequently taken to a hospital for treatment under police custody.DCP (East) Tejaswani Gautam said the motive behind the murder remains under investigation. However, local sources pointed to an ongoing dispute between the victim and the accused spanning two years, despite previous attempts at mediation.Enraged residents claimed Anas had previously threatened multiple families in the area, including Kumar's. ""Anas had been arrested before. Police even paraded him in public, but he only grew bolder,"" said Sunil Khatik, a local resident.The victim's family demanded compensation, including employment guarantee and financial assistance, as they refused to proceed with the postmortem until their demands were met.As family members and locals demanded immediate justice, unrest spread, leading to repeated attempts at blocking traffic on the national highway. Police efforts to control the situation resulted in sporadic clashes, with some demonstrators damaging nearby shops before being pushed back.By the evening, while the size of the agitating crowd diminished, the local community remained insistent on compensation, including a job and financial support for Kumar's family, and the execution of the accused.A large police force, including Rapid Action Force (RAF) and Quick Response Teams (QRT), was deployed throughout the area.The roots of the conflict reportedly trace back two years to an incident involving a goat belonging to Kumar’s family.One sister recalled that the tension began two years ago, when Kumar’s goat strayed into Anas’s lane. Friends of Kumar said a possible dispute over a girl may have played a role. Police said this claim surfaced during early questioning but was unconfirmed.","Vipin Kumar, 22, was stabbed around 14 times, allegedly by Mohammad Anas and his associates.

NEW DELHI: The man, who saved the 15-year-old girl from Odisha's Puri district after she was set ablaze by unidentified men, recounted the harrowing 90 minutes after she knocked on his door, screaming for help, ""save me, save me. ""A 15-year-old girl, allegedly set on fire by three masked men in Odisha’s Puri district, was transferred to AIIMS New Delhi, where she remains in stable condition with 70-75%burn injuries.The class 9 dropout was walking to a relative’s home around 8.30am Saturday when she was reportedly intercepted near a river embankment, rendered unconscious by a chemical-lacedcloth, and doused with kerosene before being set ablaze.Screaming for help, she fled to a nearby house, where Dukshishyam Senapati extinguished the flames and gave her fresh clothes.Recalling the harrowing moment, Senapati said that when he answered his door, he was stunned to find the girl engulfed in flames and crying in agony, as he later explained to DGP YB Khurania during the official's site visit.""It was around 8.30 am when the girl came to my house, screaming. With the help of my wife, I doused the fire and gave her water as she was very thirsty.Later, the women of my family changed her clothes,"" he said.Upon questioning, the girl informed Senapati that three unidentified men had set her ablaze.

The faces of these men were half-covered, and they took her to a place near the Bhargavi riverbank. She could not tell their names. She could only say that they covered her face with a handkerchief and poured some substance before setting her on fire,"" he said.Senapati noticed that although the girl mentioned being bound during the abduction, her hands were free when she arrived. After learning her father's details, he contacted her family. The large crowd that gathered prevented further conversation with the victim.Despite searching the area, Senapati couldn't locate the perpetrators. He explained that the attackers fled after setting her alight, presumably expecting her to perish. However, the girl managed to escape and reach his house.Due to delayed ambulance response, they resorted to an auto rickshaw for hospital transport.

Dhankhar's move to examine oppn's notice raised suspicions

NEW DELHI: ""Shri Jagdeep Dhankhar ji has had many opportunities to serve our country in various capacities, including as Vice-President of India. Wishing him good health,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi posted on X, shortly after President Droupadi Murmu accepted Dhankhar's resignation.Going by sendoff messages for politicians, the post was starkly terse and conveyed the tension that resulted in Dhankhar's abrupt resignation as vice-president on Monday evening. Political circles were quick to note that the PM had refrained from commenting on the outgoing VP's functioning as chairman of the Rajya Sabha: something that was taken as confirmation that Dhankhar's decision on Monday to admit the opposition's notice for the motion of removal of Allahabad HC's Justice Yashwant Varma, despite having known the govt's decision to start the process in the Lok Sabha (which TOI had reported on Tuesday, had not gone down well).The contrast from the effusive praise for Dhankhar three years ago, when the Modi govt elevated him to the second highest constitutional position, was glaring and fully captured the radical change in equations since he was plucked from near-obscurity to be appointed governor of West Bengal in 2019, a big ""opportunity"" that had come his way courtesy the current central dispensation.If brevity was the PM's chosen weapon to convey the disappointment, his senior cabinet colleagues said it all through sheer silence on their X handles.NDA partners were also equally conspicuous by their reticence, the sole exception being the Andhra ally, Jana Sena leader Pawan Kalyan.The 'cancellation' was a measure of the annoyance Dhankhar managed to generate by his moves through Monday, starting with his unusual generosity towards LOP Mallikarjun Kharge.The then Chairman, whom the opposition had relentlessly targeted for being partisan, chose to let Kharge speak ahead of the leader of the House and health minister J P Nadda, although by convention, the latter should have been given precedence.That Kharge launched a sharp attack on govt and the PM over the Pahalgam terror attack and US President Donald Trump's unsubstantiated claim of having forced India and Pakistan to halt Operation Sindoor only added to the irritation that had begun to build up on treasury benches and which found expression in Nadda's uncharacteristic ""only what I say is going to be on record"" assertion to protesting opposition members.But it took the second 'provocation' of the day - Dhankhar's announcement post-lunch about having received a notice from 63 members in support of a motion for the removal of Justice Varma, and his directive to examine where it would stand vis-a-vis a similar move made by 153 members in the Lok Sabha earlier in the day - that turned the smouldering annoyance into anger and, crucially, sparked suspicion about his intent.All signatories to the RS notice were, in contrast to the all-party complexion of what had earlier been submitted in Lok Sabha, from the opposition - something which militated against govt's known desire for a ""consensus"" backing for action against Justice Varma's alleged corruption and could not have escaped Dhankhar's attention. Dhankhar's indulgence of the opposition would have ensured him a say in the choice of the three-member panel that is required to go into the charges of corruption against the judge.Already upset with him over the barbs he would routinely train at the judiciary, as well as the perception that they were officially sponsored, govt did not take kindly at the meddling.Similar activism from Dhankhar had earlier led Supreme Court to drop its inquiry against Allahabad high court Justice Shekhar Yadav in a case of alleged hate speech and fling the ball back into the Rajya Sabha's court.What followed was a flurry of moves. Amid deepening suspicions about the intent and buzz of a ""secret deal"", BJP managers scrambled to get the NDA contingent to sign off on a similar notice. Such was the hurry that many RS members trooping into the chamber of defence minister Rajnath Singh did not even get to see the text of the notice as they put their signatures on the paper put up before them.Simultaneously, both Nadda and parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju decided to skip the business advisory committee meeting Dhankhar had convened in the evening, leaving it for minister of state L Murugan and BJP's chief whip K Laxman to represent the governing side.The message for Dhankhar was clear and he lost little time in heeding it. Just hours later, he rushed to the Rashtrapati Bhavan to submit his resignation on ""health"" grounds.The dominant estimate in political circles is that he is not going to quietly fade away. Many feel the Supreme Court lawyer, who started off with Janata Dal and did a stint with Congress before landing in BJP, may launch himself in a different version: as a farm leader.There was also a sudden outbreak of ""sympathy"" for him in opposition quarters, with even Congress and Trinamool Congress, his chief tormentors, seeking to portray him as a victim.But he appeared to be receding from the proceedings he would lord over when presiding officer Ghanshyam Tiwari announced that his resignation had been accepted.",Jagdeep Dhankhar resigned as vice-president of India on Monday evening.

Destruction of CDRs raises serious doubts over integrity of 11/7 probe: HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/destruction-of-cdrs-raises-serious-doubts-over-integrity-of-11/7-probe-hc/articleshow/122845163.cms,"Mumbai local blasts

MUMBAI: Bombay high court questioned ATS over the ""integrity"" and deletion of call data records (CDRs) in its probe into the 11/7 train blasts, adding ""reluctance of the prosecution to bring CDRs on record and their destruction raises an adverse inference against the prosecution"".HC said the prosecution's case was that conspiracy meetings were held at the residence of a planter in Bandra, attended by four other accused. In May, a prosecution witness met the planter and others near Shams Masjid, in Mira Road, where the witness was instructed by the planter to call another accused there. Besides, confessions of two accused said one handed over his mobile phone to the other near Lucky Hotel, Bandra, at 4.15pm, the judgment said.In its claim of one eyewitness seeing an alleged blast conspiracy meeting, ""prosecution could have easily established location and movement of accused at the relevant places and times through CDRs. Instead, the CDR was destroyed. This act raises serious doubts over the integrity of the investigation and amounts to a grave violation of right to a fair trial,"" the HC special bench of Justices Anil Kilor and Shyam Chandak held.HC said CDR was of critical importance, particularly because first arrest in 11/7 case was made based on a mobile number allegedly belonging to accused Kamal Ansari (who died in 2021 after conviction in Nagpur prison) from which a religious SMS was sent, arousing suspicion in minds of ATS. HC said prosecution appeared to have done no probe to corroborate the witness's claim of having met near the masjid or at accused's house. ""Prosecution could have produced the CDR of either the witness or the accused to establish their location,"" HC held.The witness' statement is shrouded in doubt. Besides, while his statement was said to be recorded by an ACP at Chandan Chowki, the certified logbook shows the ACP ""did not even go"" there that day. Prosecution said allegedly ""as per the Al-Qaeda Manual and training given to the accused, they were not supposed to use their mobile phones for operational purposes"".""In the absence of direct evidence of conspiracy, a chain of events has to be completed from which a conclusion of guilt of the accused can be drawn,"" HC said. The court added that with the eight unreliable eyewitnesses, the chain could not be completed, and the witness was of no help in establishing the conspiracy claim."," Bombay high court questions ATS over the ""integrity"" and deletion of call data records (CDRs) in its probe into the 11/7 train blasts.HC said the prosecution's case was that conspiracy meetings were held at the residence of a planter in Bandra, attended by four other accused.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122845167,imgsize-74334,width-400,resizemode-4/122845167.jpg"

Exclusive: Newly discovered photos and video shed fresh light on Trump’s ties to Jeffrey Epstein

Trump and Epstein at 1999 fashion event



Trump doubles down on calling CNN ‘fake news’



In 2002, Trump called Epstein a 'terrific guy'



WSJ uncovered Epstein’s 50th birthday letter from Trump



MAGA upset over delay in releasing files







In another setback for the MAGA leader, new photos and videos have raised fresh questions about Donald Trump’s past with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.The pictures show the US President laughing, talking, and going to important events with the paedophile, including his 1993 wedding at New York’s Plaza Hotel. Some of these have never been seen before, according to CNN.One of the biggest revelations is a previously unseen photo from Trump’s wedding to model and TV personality Marla Maples.The image was taken by photographer Dafydd Jones, who captures Epstein arriving at the venue. Jones was assigned to shoot the event.“I must have recognised him going in,” Jones was quoted as saying to CNN. “I had the job of photographing the Trump wedding, so I stood with the press and photographed him. The image you have is from the contact sheet — the negatives were lost.”This photo, along with others from online archives reviewed by CNN, shows for the first time that Epstein was at the event. In one picture, Epstein can be seen in the background behind guests, including Howard Stern and Robin Leach. “I wish now I took more of him with Trump,” Jones said.CNN’s KFile team made the discovery while searching through archival material from the 1990s and 2000s.Among the pieces is raw video from a 1999 Victoria’s Secret fashion show in New York.The footage shows Trump and Epstein in conversation ahead of the runway event.Trump and Epstein's relationship dates back to the 1980s, with the two frequently seen together at events in Palm Beach and New York. They eventually fell out in the mid-2000s, reportedly over a property dispute. Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and claims he severed ties with Epstein long before the financier's legal troubles began.In a phone exchange with CNN on Tuesday, Trump was asked about the newly surfaced wedding photo. “You’ve got to be kidding me,” he replied, before calling CNN “fake news” several times and hanging up.The connection between Trump and Epstein also includes multiple appearances in party photos, shared flights, and flattering remarks.In a 2002 New York Magazine profile, Trump said Epstein was “a terrific guy” and added, “It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.”Trump is listed in Epstein’s flight logs at least seven times, flying between Palm Beach and New York. His own 2004 book Trump: How To Get Rich references a man he calls “the mysterious Jeffrey.” He wrote, “As mysterious as Jeffrey is, he’s one of the few people I know who can get by on just a first name.”Last week, the Wall Street Journal reported a birthday message allegedly sent by Trump in 2003 for Epstein’s 50th birthday. It featured an outline of a naked woman and ended with: “Happy Birthday—and may every day be another wonderful secret.” Trump has denied sending the message and is now suing the US daily.Meanwhile, the justice department said it has reached out to Ghislaine Maxwell for a meeting regarding the release of sealed grand jury materials. Maxwell’s lawyer told CNN, “Ghislaine will always testify truthfully. We are grateful to President Trump for his commitment to uncovering the truth in this case.”People are now paying more attention again to the case because the department of justice has delayed releasing important documents about Epstein’s helpers, which Trump’s attorney general, Pam Bondi, had promised to release. Many in Trump’s MAGA movement are frustrated, as they had expected important new information to be released.Epstein’s crimes became public in 2005, and he was first arrested in 2006. In 2019, he was arrested again for sex trafficking involving underage girls. He died in jail later that year. The medical examiner said it was a suicide, but many people still question how he died, with conspiracy theories continuing to spread.","New photos and video shed fresh light on Donald Trump's ties to Jeffrey Epstein.

Jeju Air Crash: Pilots shut off wrong engine; probe finds clear evidence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/jeju-air-crash-pilots-shut-off-wrong-engine-probe-finds-clear-evidence/articleshow/122811341.cms,"



South Korean investigators have found clear evidence that pilots of the Jeju Air plane that crashed in December shut down the wrong engine after a bird strike, a source familiar with the probe said on Monday.The investigation, led by South Korea’s Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board (ARAIB), has found that the left engine, which was less damaged, was shut off instead of the right engine, which had been more seriously affected by the bird strike.The source told Reuters that cockpit voice recordings, computer data, and a physical engine switch recovered from the wreckage support this conclusion.""The investigation team has clear evidence and backup data, so its finding will not change,"" the source said, speaking anonymously as the official report has not yet been released.The Boeing 737-800 aircraft, operating a flight from Bangkok, crashed while attempting to land at Muan Airport on 29 December 2023. Of the 181 people on board, only two survived, making it the deadliest air disaster on South Korean soil.An examination of the recovered engines confirmed there were no defects before the bird strike and the crash, according to a government source.Investigators reportedly shared these findings with the victims' families during a private briefing on Saturday.A third source, who was present at the meeting, said the families were told the right engine had suffered greater damage, but the left, less-damaged, engine was shut down instead.The ARAIB has not officially commented on the findings. Boeing, the aircraft manufacturer, directed queries to ARAIB. Engine manufacturer CFM International, a joint venture between GE and France’s Safran, has not responded to requests for comment.Jeju Air said it is actively cooperating with the investigation and is awaiting the official release of the results.While a preliminary report issued in January confirmed the presence of duck remains in both engines, it did not specify the extent of damage. A scheduled media briefing on Saturday was cancelled after victims’ families objected to the report being made public, saying it unfairly focused on pilot error and failed to consider other factors.The Jeju Air flight overshot the runway during an emergency belly landing and crashed into an embankment containing navigation equipment. The collision caused a fire and a partial explosion, Reuters reported.Victims’ families and the pilots’ union have urged the investigation team to also examine the embankment’s role in the severity of the crash. Aviation experts believe the structure may have contributed to the high death toll.The pilots’ union has criticised ARAIB for “misleading the public” by suggesting there was no problem with the left engine, even though bird remains were found in both engines. The union accused the investigators of making the pilots scapegoats and not providing enough scientific evidence to prove the aircraft could have landed safely with just the left engine running.The union also said the investigation has so far failed to address possible organisational responsibility. A group representing the bereaved families added that the language in the planned press release made it appear as if a final conclusion had already been reached. They have called for all facts surrounding the crash to be fully examined and clarified.Under international aviation rules, a final accident report is expected within a year of the incident.","South Korean investigators have found clear evidence that pilots of the Jeju Air plane that crashed in December shut down the wrong engine after a bird strike.

Who is Connor Estelle? Man loses job after 'I'm a fascist' remark; raises $20K in donations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-connor-estelle-man-loses-job-after-im-a-fascist-remark-raises-20k-in-donations/articleshow/122841519.cms,"Screengrab

Who is Connor Estelle?

Estelle goes by the name Pinesap in his fundraising appeal.

In Jubilee’s Surrounded debate show, Estelle openly supported autocracy and responded with “Yeah, I am,” when asked if he would describe himself as a fascist. His laughter and ease while making the admission drew sharp reactions online.

When asked about Nazi persecution, Estelle dismissed concerns by saying he “frankly doesn’t care” about being called a Nazi, and that the Nazis “persecuted the church a little bit.” When pressed about the Holocaust and Jewish persecution, he admitted it was “bad” but quickly moved on.

On GiveSendGo, Estelle says he’s raising money because “voicing legal traditional right-wing views” cost him his job. The fundraiser has already crossed $20,000. Some donors used white supremacist codes, including “88”, which stands for “Heil Hitler.”

Estelle spoke about losing his job on the Rift Report podcast, again without naming his former employer. He blamed “secularism” and “relativism” for the backlash, claiming such beliefs are no longer accepted in public discourse.

Estelle identifies as a Catholic .

GiveSendGo has previously been criticised for hosting campaigns linked to extremist causes, including those by January 6 rioters.





A man who openly described himself as a “fascist” during a political debate is now claiming he was fired from his job for expressing his views — and is asking for donations online to support himself.Connor Estelle, appeared on an episode of Surrounded, a debate series by Jubilee.

Roy Black, an eminent Miami defence lawyer who defended notable clients including Jeffrey Epstein has passed away at 80 years old, according to his law partner's statement on Tuesday.According to the Miami Herald, Black, who had two children, died at his Coral Gables residence on Monday.Blackwas a founding partner of the law firm Black Srebnick. ""For more than 30 years, Roy was my teacher, mentor and friend,"" said his law partner, Howard Srebnick, in an email to The Associated Press. ""The loss(es) I feel personally and professionally are immeasurable.""In Miami's legal community, Black was considered the finest practitioner of his time, according to fellow defence lawyer David O.

And he outlawyered every prosecutor who he ever went up against. I will miss him. His impact on criminal defense is beyond measure,"" Markus wrote in an email to the news organisation.Jackie Perczek, another law partner of Black, stated that she learned from him that it was a lawyer's duty to “fiercely battle the oppressors and support the underdog.” She added, “This generation and many to come stand on his shoulders.”Black was among the attorneys who represented Jeffrey Epstein and fought to prevent a federal judge from tossing Epstein's controversial plea deal on grounds that victims hadn’t been informed.

The Congressional upheaval over the Jeffrey Epstein investigation deepened this week as House Speaker Mike Johnson abruptly announced an early end to the legislative session, cutting it short by one day before the scheduled August recess.Johnson displayed visible frustration with reporters at the House GOP's news conference on Tuesday, striking the podium while expressing disbelief over how the Epstein matter derailed proceedings. ""There's no purpose for Congress to push an administration to do something that they're already doing. And so this is for political games,"" he said, quoted by ABC News.Republicans have suspended all legislative activity, effectively advancing the start of their five-week summer break. Johnson blamed Democrats for the disruption, aligning his position with President Donald Trump 's recent comments. However, his remarks also appeared directed at critics within his own party. ""Some people seem to enjoy trying to inflict political pain on their own teammates... It's a small, tiny handful, but one in particular is giving me lots of consternation. I don't understand Thomas Massie's motivation. I really don't. I don't know how his mind works,"" ABC News reported him saying.The controversy erupted after the GOP-led Rules Committee adjourned indefinitely on Monday night, just as Democrats moved to force a vote on bipartisan legislation demanding the release of Epstein-related files.Representative Thomas Massie criticised the adjournment and Johnson's leadership. ""People have wanted these files for years. The president's staff, administration, his own children, his vice president have promised that these files would come out, and now we're being told it's a hoax. It just doesn't wash,"" he told ABC News.Massie indicated plans to work with Democrats and a few Republicans to try again in the autumn. ""You don't lose your base over one single thing, but [Trump's] eroding his base. And more importantly, if we don't take the right side of this issue, it's going to cost us votes in the midterms,"" he warned.House Republicans have now cancelled several votes on key legislation, including immigration and clean water bills, citing Democrats' persistent attempts to force votes on Epstein transparency.With House business halted, GOP leaders confirmed the chamber's early departure.

A committee spokeswoman said, ""Since Ms. Maxwell is in federal prison, the Committee will work with the Department of Justice and Bureau of Prisons to identify a date when Committee can depose her.""The Justice Department has asked a federal judge to unseal grand jury records related to Epstein, and also plans to interview Maxwell.

Former President Barack Obama 's office issued a rare public response to President Donald Trump 's accusations of ""treason"" and election manipulation in 2016 and 2020.""Out of respect for the office of the presidency, our office does not normally dignify the constant nonsense and misinformation flowing out of this White House with a response. But these claims are outrageous enough to merit one. These bizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction,"" said Obama spokesperson Patrick Rodenbush, as quoted by NBC News.This comes as Trump was questioned about Jeffrey Epstein but redirected the conversation alleging ""criminality"" by Obama. Trump stated that Obama had been directly implicated and claimed the actions in 2016 and 2020 were criminal at the highest level.Read more: Trump slams ex-US president; dodges Epstein question Trump's assertions stemmed from claims by National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, who suggested Obama administration officials had manipulated intelligence and undermined Trump's 2016 electoral victory.Gabbard initiated a criminal referral to the Justice Department on Friday. At a subsequent meeting with congressional Republicans, Trump continued his criticism of Obama and others, calling them ""vicious, horrible people.""Rodenbush countered that the administration was misrepresenting information. He noted that recent documents did not contradict the established conclusion about Russian influence in the 2016 election, as confirmed by the 2020 bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report under then-Chairman Marco Rubio.""Nothing in the document issued last week undercuts the widely accepted conclusion that Russia worked to influence the 2016 presidential election but did not successfully manipulate any votes. These findings were affirmed in a 2020 report by the bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee, led by then-Chairman Marco Rubio,"" Rodenbush further said.The controversy extends to various interpretations of a December 8, 2016, intelligence assessment regarding Russian cyber activities. Representative Gabbard alleges that documents demonstrate Russia did not seek to interfere in the 2016 election to benefit Donald Trump, contradicting multiple investigations that indicated otherwise.“On December 8 2016, IC officials prepared an assessment for the President’s Daily Brief, finding that Russia 'did not impact recent U.S. election results' by conducting cyber attacks on infrastructure. Before it could reach the President, it was abruptly pulled 'based on new guidance.' This key intelligence assessment was never published,” Gabbard wrote in a post.The Obama administration did not assert that Russian cyberattacks affected the election results. “I can assure the public that there was not the kind of tampering with the voting process that was of concern … the votes that were cast were counted — they were counted appropriately,” President Obama said from the White House, days after receiving the December 2016 brief referred to by Gabbard.The Obama White House stated that Russia attempted to interfere in the campaign by leaking hacked documents and utilising bots and troll farms to disseminate misinformation about the election—a finding later supported by Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation and a Senate report.Meanwhile, Democratic officials characterised these developments as diversionary tactics. House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar suggested the focus on these matters was intended to deflect attention from the Epstein case.Recent activities include Trump's social media posts targeting political opponents and the Justice Department's release of files concerning Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination, alongside information about James Comey's investigation of Hillary Clinton's handling of classified information.","Former President Barack Obama's office issued a rare public response to President Donald Trump's accusations of ""treason"" and election manipulation in 2016 and 2020. This comes as Trump was questioned about Jeffrey Epstein but redirected the conversation alleging ""criminality"" by Obama. Trump stated that Obama had been directly implicated and claimed the actions were criminal.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122848329,imgsize-1214018,width-400,resizemode-4/122848329.jpg"
Hockey Canada sexual assault trial: Legal experts say consent videos in the trial reveal troubling public misunderstandings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/hockey-canada-sexual-assault-trial-legal-experts-say-consent-videos-in-the-trial-reveal-troubling-public-misunderstandings/articleshow/122846454.cms,"Canadian sexual assault case involving former junior hockey players raises questions about consent (Getty Images)

Consent must be ongoing and specific, not retrospective or coerced

Scholars question use of post-incident recordings in sexual assault trials

Canada’s sports culture still lacks proper consent education, experts say

FAQs

1. Do the videos shown in court legally prove consent?

2. What did the prosecution argue about the videos?

3. Why is this case important for Canadian sports?

As five former Canadian world junior hockey players await a verdict in a high-profile sexual assault case, legal scholars are emphasizing a critical point: videos alone—especially those taken after the fact—do not constitute legal consent. The trial, centered around an alleged group sexual assault in a London, Ontario hotel room in 2018, has reignited a national conversation on how consent is understood, especially in sports culture.Two cellphone videos were shown in court, capturing the complainant saying she was “OK with this” and that “it was all consensual.” The defense cited these clips as evidence of mutual participation, but prosecutors called them misleading and irrelevant to actual legal standards.""The recording of that video is not getting her consent to anything. Everything's already happened,"" Crown attorney Meaghan Cunningham said. ""Consent must be communicated for each specific act at the time it takes place.""Daphne Gilbert, a law professor at the University of Ottawa, echoed that sentiment. “Legally speaking, they have very little relevance… There’s no such thing as advance consent. And there’s no such thing as after-the-fact consent, either.”York University law professor Lisa Dufraimont noted that the videos might be considered hearsay, as they were not made under oath. However, she added that the clips could still have evidentiary value in showing the complainant's emotional state or level of intoxication close to the time of the incident.Only Carter Hart testified in his own defense, telling the court that consent videos are not unusual among pro athletes. Teammate Michael McLeod told police he recorded one out of fear that “something like this might happen.”Gilbert said Canada—and hockey in particular—still lags behind in properly educating athletes about consent. “Enthusiastic, affirmative, ongoing, coherent” consent is what the law requires, she stressed. “Yes means yes.”Justice Maria Carroccia is expected to deliver her ruling Thursday in what could be a defining moment for how consent is viewed in Canadian sport and law.Also Read: Hockey Canada trial judge faces career-defining moment with high-stakes sexual assault verdict No, legal experts say consent must be specific, ongoing, and given at the time of each act—not after the fact.The Crown said the complainant felt pressured and the videos were “token lip service,” not genuine consent.It highlights the urgent need for better consent education within professional hockey and youth sports systems.","Five former Canadian world junior hockey players await a verdict in a high- profile sexual assault case.

Donald Trump’s old tweet slamming name change resurfaces as he now demands return to 'Redskins'



Critics pounce on Trump's contradictions



FAQs:



1. When did the Washington Commanders change their name from Redskins?

2. Why was the name ""Redskins"" considered offensive?

3. What did Donald Trump recently say about the team’s name?

President Donald Trump has reignited controversy by pushing the Washington Commanders to revert to their former name—the Redskins—a term widely denounced as a racial slur against Native Americans. His stance has invited widespread criticism, especially as an old tweet of his has resurfaced, in which he condemned then-President Barack Obama for making similar commentary on the same issue.Back in 2013, when Barack Obama suggested it might be time for the Washington NFL team to consider changing their name, Donald Trump was quick to fire back. “President should not be telling the Washington Redskins to change their name—our country has far bigger problems! FOCUS on them, not nonsense,” he wrote on X. At the time, Trump framed the issue as trivial and accused Obama of being distracted from more pressing national matters.Fast forward to July 20, 2025, and Trump appears to be eating his own words. In a post on Truth Social, the POTUS threatened to block the Washington Commanders' stadium deal unless the team changes its name back to the Redskins. “I may put a restriction on them that if they don’t change the name back to the original ‘Washington Redskins,’ and get rid of the ridiculous moniker, ‘Washington Commanders,’ I won’t make a deal for them to build a Stadium in Washington,” he wrote.Trump even expanded his cultural crusade by targeting Major League Baseball's Cleveland Guardians, calling on them to return to the name “Cleveland Indians,” despite both name changes stemming from long-standing criticism of racial insensitivity.Social media didn’t take long to highlight the glaring contradiction. Within hours, screenshots of Trump’s 2013 tweet were circulating widely, fueling allegations of blatant hypocrisy. The timing couldn’t be more suspect, as Trump’s comments arrived amid public scrutiny over unreleased Epstein investigation files and economic challenges across the country. Many have labeled the NFL name dispute as a political sideshow—part of a broader strategy to spark outrage and distract from deeper issues.Whether Trump’s threats will bear any fruit remains uncertain. What’s clear, however, is that his critics are armed with his own words, ready to challenge him at every turn. His claim that there's a “big clamoring” to restore the Redskins name has been disputed, especially given the name was dropped in 2020 following a wave of national protests and calls for racial justice. The team operated as the Washington Football Team until 2022 before rebranding as the Commanders.Trump’s attempt to politicize team branding again raises questions—not just about cultural sensitivity, but about consistency, credibility, and calculated outrage in American politics.The team dropped the ""Redskins"" name in 2020 due to growing criticism over its racial insensitivity.""Redskins"" was widely regarded as a racial slur against Native Americans and sparked years of protests and backlash.Trump threatened to block a stadium deal unless the team reverts to the ""Washington Redskins"" name.Also Read: Travis Kelce took Taylor Swift obsession to the racetrack with surprise stake in horse named ‘Swift Delivery’","Donald Trump has reignited controversy by pushing the Washington Commanders to revert to their former name.

AUSTIN: Texas lawmakers on Wednesday were set to begin reviewing the July 4 floods that killed at least 135 people, a disaster that put local officials under scrutiny over why residents along the Guadalupe River did not receive more warnings.The catastrophic floods in the Texas hill country and a partisan redrawing of US house maps, aimed at giving republicans more winnable seats in the 2026 elections, are two major issues in a 30-day special session that is already off to a combative start.Democrats want to address flood relief and new flood warning systems before taking votes on new congressional maps sought by president Donald Trump. They have not ruled out a walkout in a bid to derail the redistricting, which they have slammed as a partisan power grab.State and county emergency response officials are scheduled to testify on Wednesday, but no officials from Kerr County, the area most hard-hit by the floods, are expected to appear.Lawmakers have filed bills to improve early warning systems and emergency communications and to provide relief funding. Kerr County, where 27 campers and counselors, most of them children, were killed at Camp Mystic, an all-girls Christian summer camp, does not have a warning system along the river after several missed opportunities by state and local agencies to finance one.Three people remain missing. At one point, county officials said more than 170 people were unaccounted for.Lawmakers are scheduled to visit Kerrville on July 31 to hear from residents.Democrats have left open the possibility of filibusters or walking out in the coming weeks to block the proposed congressional map redraw. On Monday, most of the party's members in the house signed a letter to the speaker stating that they would not engage in any work before addressing flood relief.But democrats have few paths to resistance as the minority party in both chambers.

Columbia University said on Tuesday that it has punished several students for their role in anti-Israel protests held on campus in 2024. The actions include expulsions, suspensions, and even revoking degrees. While the university did not share exact numbers, a student group said nearly 80 students have been targeted.These punishments are linked to two specific protest events — a sit-in at the university library in May and a protest encampment during alumni weekend in spring. Columbia said the library protest disrupted hundreds of students during exam preparation time. Disciplinary measures included probation, suspensions lasting from one to three years, degree cancellations, and permanent expulsions.This crackdown comes as Colombia negotiates with the Trump administration to regain $400 million in federal funds that were cut. Trump has accused top universities like Columbia and Harvard of not doing enough to stop alleged anti-Semitism during protests against Israel’s war in Gaza. Columbia, which was at the centre of last year’s campus protests, has now agreed to introduce several policy reforms as part of the funding talks.Some students say these changes are giving in to political pressure.Meanwhile, Harvard is challenging the funding cuts in court. Columbia said this was the final set of disciplinary actions related to last spring’s protests.The student group Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD), which supports cutting financial ties with Israel, said the punishments for the library protest were far harsher than those for past demonstrations. “We will not be deterred,” the group said, adding that they remain committed to supporting Palestine.","Columbia University said on Tuesday that it has punished several students for their role in anti-Israel protests held on campus in 2024.

Kamala Harris Makes A Fiery Comeback; 'Mr. Trump, White House Is Not Yours...' | Watch

Where is Kamala Harris now?





Social media erupted with criticism on Monday after former US Vice President Kamala Harris commemorated the anniversary of her presidential campaign launch.Exactly one year ago, on July 21, then-President Joe Biden announced via social media that he would not seek re-election. He subsequently endorsed Harris, who went on to secure the Democratic nomination for the 2024 presidential election To mark the anniversary, Harris shared a post on X featuring photos from her campaign. ""One year ago today, I began my campaign for President of the United States. Over the 107 days of our race, I had the opportunity and honor to travel our nation and meet with Americans who were fighting for a better future. And today, millions of Americans continue to stand up for our values, our ideals, and our democracy. Their courage and resolve inspires me. Whether you are attending a protest, calling your representatives, or building community, I want to say: Thank you. We are in this fight together,"" Harris wrote.The post drew sharp reactions online, with many users mocking Harris for commemorating a campaign that did not win a single primary vote. Others noted the complete absence of Joe Biden from both the photographs and the message.Twitchy's Amy Curtis responded, ""You didn't get a single primary vote.How very democratic."" The RNC Research, run by the Republican National Committee, added, ""Becoming the presidential nominee without getting a single vote is not the flex you think it is.""Washington Free Beacon investigative reporter Chuck Ross commented, ""lol. complete Joe Biden erasure.""Political commentator Link Lauren remarked, ""No mention of Biden again. Really trying to erase her association with him. She was there in lockstep with that failing administration. I don't have amnesia.""National Review senior writer Dan McLaughlin questioned, ""I wonder what caused that campaign to begin on July 21.""""'One year ago today, I began my campaign for President of the United States.' Oh wow, I remember that. What did Drew Barrymore call you? Momala? Oooh, and Beyonce endorsed you, right? How did you work out? Did you win?"" author John Hawkins wrote.Since leaving Washington in January, Harris mostly stayed out of the public eye, settling back into her Brentwood home in California with her husband, Doug Emhoff, and spoke to close friends and confidantes about her next steps.She weighed whether to leave politics, run for governor or run for President for a third time. She is expected to make a decision about the gubernatorial race by the end of summer, as reported by LA Times.Harris’s limited public appearances this year- including visits to a high school graduation in Compton, a DNC fundraiser in the Bay Area, and a meeting with firefighters in Altadena — have fueled speculation about her political plans.Her absence from the California Democratic Party convention and her husband Doug Emhoff’s new teaching role at USC have added to the intrigue. Harris recently canceled a planned two-week vacation and has been spotted in New York attending Broadway shows and the Met Gala, as well as dining and shopping in San Francisco and Los Angeles.","Former US Vice President Kamala Harris commemorated the anniversary of her presidential campaign launch on Monday.

The Donald Trump administration Monday released records of FBI's surveillance of Martin Luther King Jr and his assassination in 1968. “Today, after nearly 60 years of questions surrounding the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., we are releasing 230,000 MLK assassination files,” Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard wrote on X. Gabbard said that the documents, released in partnership with the Justice Department, Central Intelligence Agency, National Archives and the FBI, detail the federal investigation into the shooting at Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tenn., which resulted in 39-year-old King’s death.“The American people have waited nearly sixty years to see the full scope of the federal government’s investigation into Dr. King’s assassination,” Gabbard said. “Under President Trump’s leadership, we are ensuring that no stone is left unturned in our mission to deliver complete transparency on this pivotal and tragic event in our nation’s history.”“I extend my deepest appreciation to the King family for their support.”King’s family, including his two living children, Martin III, 67, and Bernice, 62, were given advance notice of the release and had their own teams reviewing the records ahead of the public disclosure.They issued a lengthy statement after the government's release and said their father's assassination captivated public curiosity for decades. But they said that these files are personal and must be viewed within their full historical context.“As the children of Dr King and Mrs Coretta Scott King, his tragic death has been an intensely personal grief — a devastating loss for his wife, children, and the granddaughter he never met -- an absence our family has endured for over 57 years,” they wrote. “We ask those who engage with the release of these files to do so with empathy, restraint, and respect for our family’s continuing grief.”President Donald Trump promised as a candidate to release files related to President John F. Kennedy’s 1963 assassination. When Trump took office in January, he signed an executive order to declassify the JFK records, along with those associated with Robert F. Kennedy’s and King’s 1968 assassinations. The government unsealed the JFK records in March and disclosed some RFK files in April.","The documents detail the federal investigation into the shooting at Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tenn., which resulted in 39-year-old King’s death.

Luis Leon, an 82-year-old Pennsylvania resident, was unexpectedly deported to Guatemala after visiting a US immigration office to replace his lost green card.Leon had been living in Allentown for decades after being granted political asylum in the US in 1987, following torture under Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet’s regime.He had lost his wallet containing the physical card that confirmed his legal residency, according to The Morning Call report cited by the Guardian. Therefore, Leonus and his wife had booked an appointment at an immigration office for 20 June to have the card replaced.However, upon arrival, Leon was suddenly handcuffed by two Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers and led away without explanation, his wife said. She was allegedly held inside the building for 10 hours before relatives came to collect her. The family said they then heard nothing about Leon’s whereabouts, despite numerous attempts to contact authorities.Days later, they received a phone call from a woman claiming to be an immigration lawyer who said she could assist, but she did not explain how she knew about the case or where Leon was being held. On 9 July, the same woman contacted the family again and told them Leon had died.However, in a shocking twist, the family learned a week later through a relative in Chile that Leon was, in fact, alive, but hospitalised in Guatemala, a country with which he has no known connection. The relative said Leon had initially been detained in an immigration facility in Minnesota before being deported, although his name did not appear on any public ICE deportation lists.His family remains in the dark about how and why he was removed to Guatemala. A recent US Supreme Court ruling had allowed the Trump-era policy permitting deportations to third countries, not just countries of origin, to stand.Leon, who had spent nearly four decades in the US working at a leather manufacturing plant and raising a family, had since retired. His medical condition remains unclear, but relatives say that he suffers from diabetes, high blood pressure and a heart condition. They now planning to travel to Guatemala to be by his side.The case is currently under investigation.","Luis Leon, 82, was granted political asylum in the US in 1987 following torture under Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet’s regime.

Suspect on run after stealing firetruck, causing massive amount of damage





A fire truck theft in Washington state on Friday night led to extensive damage and multiple vehicle collisions.The incident occurred when an Everett Fire Department vehicle was taken from Hoyt Avenue, situated 30 miles north of Seattle, whilst firefighters attended a medical emergency at an apartment building's fifth floor, according to the department's update on Saturday morning, quoted by NBC News.The thief drove the fire engine at high speeds through north Everett's residential areas, causing considerable damage to parked vehicles and landscaping across five locations before abandoning the vehicle. The theft was discovered after 11 pm (Local time) when the first 911 call reported a hit-and-run incident. Witnesses reported that the fire truck had struck two parked vehicles at high speed before leaving the scene.The vehicle eventually came to a halt in the 1000 block of E Marine View Drive after colliding with at least ten parked vehicles. The Everett Police Department responded to at least six locations where damage to parked cars, trees, directional signs and grass was reported. Fortunately, no injuries occurred at any of the sites.“Losing a fire engine in such a reckless manner not only jeopardizes the safety of our first responders but also puts our community at risk,” said Everett Police Chief John DeRousse said in a statement, quoted by NY Post.The 2018 Pierce Enforcer pumper truck, which retailed between Rs 4 crore and Rs 8 crore, was severely damaged and had to be taken out of service.The stolen vehicle, a 2018 Pierce Enforcer Pumper weighing approximately 35,000 pounds, sustained significant damage and has been impounded as evidence. The fire truck, one of the department's newer engines, is particularly dangerous when moving due to its substantial weight.Everett Police Chief John DeRousse said, ""Losing a fire engine to such a reckless person not only jeopardizes the safety of our first responders but also puts our community at risk. We are committed to ensuring the safety of our residents, and any information that helps us resolve this incident is crucial. It is imperative that we hold the suspect accountable for their actions, and we will work diligently to bring them to justice. ""The police are seeking public assistance with information or footage of the incident. Fire Chief Dave DeMarco confirmed they are investigating preventive measures for the future, stating: ""We are thankful that no one was injured in this event, and we remain focused on safeguarding our community and our emergency response capabilities.""","Suspect on run after stealing firetruck, causing massive amount of damage in Everett, Washington.

US envoy to discuss finalizing Gaza aid 'corridor': State Dept | AFP





US president Donald Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, is travelling to the Middle East as Washington tries again to secure a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. The conflict has dragged on for over 21 months, with the situation in Gaza getting worse, especially for people trying to get food and aid.State department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters on Tuesday that Witkoff was going with a “strong hope” of helping finalise a ceasefire deal and set up a new humanitarian corridor.“I would suggest that we might have some good news, but, again, this could be a constantly changing dynamic,” Bruce said.She did not share details of Witkoff’s travel plans or meetings. The announcement came after one of Gaza’s deadliest days for people seeking aid — at least 85 Palestinians were killed on Sunday while trying to reach food.The Israeli army claimed it only fired warning shots and said the death toll was being exaggerated. But the UN’s food agency accused Israeli forces of firing directly on the crowd.Bruce called the incident at Zikim crossing “absolutely horrible” and said it showed why a humanitarian corridor was urgently needed as part of any ceasefire.Talks between Israel and Hamas have been going on for weeks in Qatar. The US has proposed a 60-day ceasefire during which Hamas would release some hostages, Israel would free Palestinian prisoners, and more aid would enter Gaza.Talks on a permanent peace would begin during this period.But both sides remain firm. Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants to keep fighting until Hamas is defeated and disarmed. Hamas says it won’t release all hostages unless the war fully ends — and wants a guarantee that Israel won’t resume attacks after the 60 days, like it did in March.","Steve Witkoff is travelling to the Middle East to discuss a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.

‘Obama tried coup’: Trump slams ex-US president; dodges Epstein question,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/obama-tried-coup-trump-slams-ex-us-president-dodges-epstein-question/articleshow/122844788.cms,".





US president Donald Trump on Tuesday accused former president Barack Obama of leading a coup against him in 2016.While hosting Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos Jr at the White House, president Trump was asked a question about Jeffrey Epstein, which he brushed aside. Instead, he accused Obama of trying to interfere in the 2016 election.Trump called the Epstein investigation a “witch hunt” and said the real issue was Obama’s alleged role in a plot to undermine his victory against Hillary Clinton. “The witch hunt you should be talking about is they caught president Obama, absolutely cold,” Trump said, before making a series of claims.The US president said he wanted the US department of justice to launch a criminal investigation into Obama. He told reporters that Obama, along with Hillary Clinton and others, tried to undermine American democracy.""We found absolute -- this isn't like 'evidence' or like -- this is proof, irrefutable proof that Obama was seditious, that Obama was trying to lead a coup, and with Hillary Clinton and all these other people, but Obama headed it up. This is the biggest scandal in the history of our country. It really goes on even to the autopen.""Trump added that recently declassified documents would prove his allegations. He claimed the Democrats paid $12 million to former British spy Christopher Steele for a report he called fake.He also said the report included false claims that media houses refused to print before the election. Trump claimed he had strong documentation, and said intelligence director Tulsi Gabbard told him more documents would be released soon.Trump linked the alleged conspiracy to the 2020 presidential election, which he again described as “rigged”.Trump also accused the January 6 committee of destroying evidence that could have revealed wrongdoing.","US president Donald Trump accused former president Barack Obama of leading a coup against him in 2016.

‘Not too distant’: Donald Trump hints at upcoming China visit; meeting with Xi Jinping on cards,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/not-too-distant-donald-trump-hints-at-upcoming-china-visit-meeting-with-xi-jinping-on-cards/articleshow/122842440.cms,"File photo (Picture credit: ANI)





US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he may travel to China “not too far into the future” to meet with President Xi Jinping , signalling a potential diplomatic thaw amid intense trade negotiations and geopolitical tensions.Speaking alongside Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr at the White House, Trump confirmed that Xi had extended an invitation. “President Xi has invited me to China, and we'll probably be doing that in the not-too-distant future,” he told reporters.“It’s a little bit out, but not too distant”, Trump added.According to CNA, while no final plans have been announced, sources familiar with the matter cited by news agency Reuters claim that the visit could be timed to coincide with a broader Asia tour later this year.Two possible occasions under consideration are the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea from October 30 to November 1, or a separate Beijing trip on September 3 for the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, a ceremony Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to attend.The White House and Chinese authorities have not yet confirmed details about any potential Trump-Xi meeting. However, the Kremlin has indicated it would not rule out a meeting between Trump and Putin if both leaders happen to be in Beijing at the same time.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Monday said, “If it so happens that [Trump] is there, then, of course, we cannot rule out that the question of the expediency of holding a meeting will be raised.”According to The Times, Beijing is actively considering playing host to a summit involving all three leaders, a move that could have wide-reaching diplomatic implications. Trump and Putin have already held multiple phone conversations since the former returned to office in January.Trump has expressed dissatisfaction with Moscow’s stance on Ukraine and recently warned of sanctions on Russia and its trading partners unless a peace agreement is reached by early September.In his comments on Tuesday, Trump described the US-China relationship as being on stable ground. “We’re getting along with China very well,” he said, adding that President Marcos should feel free to pursue economic ties with Beijing.“It wouldn’t bother me at all,” Trump remarked, to which Marcos replied, “It is something that we have to do in any case.”The meeting comes at a crucial moment, as the Trump administration pushes Beijing to meet an August 12 deadline to finalise a new trade agreement. Although Trump has toned down his rhetoric in recent weeks, the US continues to apply pressure over Chinese industrial overcapacity, fentanyl-related exports, and regional security concerns.A proposed 10 per cent universal base tariff on all imports remains on the table, alongside a sharply higher 55 per cent rate on goods from China.Despite unresolved disputes, including China’s support for Russia, exit bans on American residents, and aggressive moves in the Indo-Pacific, Trump has reiterated his willingness to keep lines of communication open with Xi, underscoring what he called a “very good relationship” with the Chinese leader.",US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he may travel to China “not too far into the future” to meet with President Xi Jinping.

Golden Dome blow: Trump may sideline Musk from missile shield project; Bezos may cash in,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/golden-dome-blow-trump-may-sideline-musk-from-missile-shield-project-bezos-may-cash-in/articleshow/122840344.cms,".





The Trump administration is quietly looking for alternatives to SpaceX for its ambitious Golden Dome missile defence system, weeks after the public rift between the two, according to news agency Reuters.Until recently, Trump's former political ally Elon Musk's SpaceX was the top contender to help build the Golden Dome, a missile shield Trump has frequently touted in speeches.According to Wall Street Journal, Trump aides have launched a fresh review of SpaceX’s federal contracts, hoping to find potential overspending or loopholes. But the new review hasn’t yielded much. Most of SpaceX’s existing contracts — with Nasa and the Pentagon — were deemed too critical to tamper with.Despite the tensions, the US government remains deeply tied to Musk’s companies. Over the years, SpaceX and Tesla have benefited from billions in public funding and contracts.Still, Trump’s team is reportedly exploring whether competitors, including Jeff Bezos’ Amazon-backed Project Kuiper, can replace SpaceX in future projects like Golden Dome.Interestingly, Musk himself has said SpaceX isn’t interested in working on the missile shield. In April, he posted on his social media: “SpaceX has not tried to bid for any contract in this regard. Our strong preference would be to stay focused on taking humanity to Mars.”","Until recently, Elon Musk's SpaceX was the top contender to help build the Golden Dome, a missile shield Trump has frequently touted in speeches.
