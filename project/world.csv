NEW DELHI: Leader of opposition in Lok Sabha and Congress MP Rahul Gandhi on Sunday, while addressing members of the Indian diaspora in Boston, alleged that Election Commission is ""compromised"" and claimed there is ""something very wrong with the system.""Citing the example of the Maharashtra assembly elections , former Congress president said, ""More people voted in Maharashtra than the total number of people in Maharashtra, and this is a fact... the Election Commission gave us a figure in the evening around 5:30pm, and in two hours around 7:30pm, 65 lakh voters had voted, which is physically impossible.""""It's very clear to us that the Election Commission is compromised, there is something very wrong with the system."" he added.This is not the first time Gandhi threw allegation on EC. Gandhi, along with many other opposition leaders has questioned the credibility of poll body repeatedly.Earlier, the sources in the Election Commission had told ANI news agency that the allegations of manipulated electoral rolls were unfounded. They mentioned that during the recent Special Summary Revision (SSR) published in January 2025, there were very few appeals or corrections sought under Sections 22 to 24 of the Representation of People Act.The SSR is a routine process to update electoral rolls, ensuring the inclusion of new voters and removal of duplicates or deceased individuals. According to officials, only 89 appeals were filed in Maharashtra, despite the presence of over 13.8 million Booth Level Agents (BLAs) across the country. With such low contestation, sources said the final electoral rolls must be considered undisputed.During his speech, Rahul Gandhi also spoke about India-US relations , expressing optimism about continued cooperation between the two nations.""We have a partnership with the US, and hopefully we will continue to work together,"" he said.He also thanked members of the diaspora for supporting the Congress party abroad. ""You believe, you listen to other people, and you respect them. This is what runs in the Congress party and in our family.... Thank you for carrying the flag here, it's a very powerful thing to do..."" he said.LoP Gandhi is scheduled to deliver an address at Brown University on Monday as part of his US visit.","Congress MP Rahul Gandhi on Sunday, while addressing members of the Indian diaspora in Boston, alleged that Election Commission is ""compromised"" Gandhi, along with many other opposition leaders has questioned the credibility of poll body repeatedly.

"'Muslim commissioner': Amid Supreme Court row, BJP's Nishikant Dubey targets poll panel ex-chief",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/muslim-commissioner-amid-supreme-court-row-bjps-nishikant-dubey-targets-poll-panel-ex-chief/articleshow/120458402.cms,"Nishikant Dubey and SY Quraishi.

NEW DELHI: A day after controversial statements on Supreme Court and Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna, BJP MP Nishikant Dubey targeted former chief election commissioner S Y Quraishi , labelling him a ' Muslim commissioner '.The incident occured following Quraishi's criticism of the Waqf (Amendment) Act, which he described as a 'sinister and evil plan of the government to grab Muslim lands.'On April 17, Quraishi posted on X: ""Wakf Act is undoubtedly a blatantly sinister evil plan of the govt to grab Muslim lands. I'm sure SC will call it out. Misinformation by the mischievous propaganda machine has done its job well.""Responding on Sunday, Dubey accused Quraishi of facilitating Bangladeshi infiltrators' voter registration in Jharkhand's Santhal Pargana during his tenure. ""You were not an election commissioner, you were a Muslim commissioner. The maximum number of Bangladeshi infiltrators were made voters in Santhal Pargana in Jharkhand during your tenure,"" he wrote on X.""Prophet Muhammad's Islam came to India in 712. This land (Waqf) before that belonged to Hindus or tribals, Jains or Buddhists associated with that faith. My village, Vikramshila, was burnt by Bakhtiyar Khilji in 1189. Vikramshila University gave the world its first vice-chancellor in the form of Atish Dipankar,"" added Dubey, who currently serves his fourth term as Lok Sabha representative from Godda, Jharkhand.He concluded by stating: ""Unite this country, read history; division created Pakistan, and there will be no more partitions now, will there?""This incident occurred shortly after Dubey's controversial comments about CJI Khanna and the apex court, which led the BJP to dissociate itself from his statements. Dubey had said that the Supreme Court was 'inciting religious wars' and questioned its authority, suggesting that the Parliament building should be closed if the apex court was to make laws.""The top court has only one aim: 'Show me the face, and I will show you the law'. The Supreme Court is going beyond its limits. If one has to go to the Supreme Court for everything, then Parliament and State Assembly should be shut,"" Dubey told ANI.Referring to past decisions of the court, Dubey criticised the judiciary for its handling of issues like the decriminalisation of homosexuality and religious disputes. ""There was an Article 377 in which homosexuality was a big crime. The Trump administration has said that there are only two sexes in this world, either male or female...Whether it is Hindu, Muslim, Buddhist, Jain or Sikh, all believe that homosexuality is a crime. One fine morning, the Supreme Court said that we abolish this case...Article 141 says that the laws we make, the judgments we give, are applicable from the lower court to the Supreme Court. Article 368 states that Parliament has the authority to enact all laws, and the Supreme Court has the power to interpret the law. The top court is asking the President and Governor to tell what they have to do regarding the Bills. When the Ram Mandir, Krishna Janmabhoomi, or Gyanvapi issue arises, you (SC) say, 'Show us the paper'. Mughals ke aane ke baad jo Masjid banne hai unke liye keh raho ho paper kaha se dikhao,"" he added.Dubey further alleged that the Supreme Court wants to take this country towards ""anarchy.""""How can you give direction to the appointing authority? The President appoints the Chief Justice of India. The Parliament makes the law of this country. You will dictate that Parliament?... How did you make a new law? In which law is it written that the President has to make a decision within three months? This means that you want to take this country towards anarchy. When the Parliament sits, there will be a detailed discussion on this,"" he had said.",BJP MP Nishikant Dubey called former chief election commissioner S Y Quraishi a'Muslim commissioner' Dubey's comments follow his controversial statements on Supreme Court and Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna.

"Houses damaged, highway blocked as flash flood hits J&K’s Ramban; over 100 rescued: Key points",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/houses-damaged-highway-blocked-as-flash-flood-hits-jks-ramban-over-100-rescued-key-points/articleshow/120451400.cms,"Ramban cloudburst

Here are the key points:



Rescue operations were still under way when last reports came in, with police and emergency teams battling rough weather to reach affected villagers.

Over 100 people were safely rescued from flood-hit Dharam Kund village, where nearly 40 houses were damaged -- 10 of them completely washed away.

The downpour led to multiple landslides and mudslides between Nashri and Banihal on the Jammu-Srinagar National Highway (NH-44), forcing its closure.

Hundreds of vehicles were stranded as stretches of the highway were rendered impassable, including a portion near Panthiyal that was swept away. Officials advised commuters to avoid travel until the road is cleared and weather improves.

The latest casualties bring the rain-related death toll in the Jammu region to five in the last 48 hours. On Saturday, two people, including a woman, were killed and another injured by lightning strikes in Reasi’s Arnas area.

A senior government official confirmed ""massive damage"" in the district due to landslides, hailstorms, and strong winds, saying the immediate priority was to protect lives. An official meeting was scheduled for later in the day to assess the situation and plan aid.

Union minister and Udhampur MP Jitendra Singh, who has been closely monitoring the developments, praised the swift response of the Ramban district administration led by Deputy Commissioner Baseer-ul-Haq Chaudhary.

Singh, in a post on X, highlighted the challenging weather conditions and said relief efforts, including financial support, were being extended. He added that his personal resources were also available for those in need and urged the public to remain calm.

“The district administration deserves appreciation for timely and prompt action, which helped save several precious lives,” he said.

Authorities continue to assess damage and provide relief, while NH-44 remains shut, cutting off the Kashmir Valley’s only all-weather road link with the rest of the country.

NEW DELHI: Flash floods and landslides triggered by incessant rain wreaked havoc across Jammu and Kashmir's Ramban district on Sunday, killing at least three people and damaging dozens of homes.The chaos was compounded by a cloudburst in Seri Bagna village, which claimed the lives of three residents -- including two brothers, Aqib Ahmad and Mohd Saqib.","Rescue operations were still under way when last reports came in, with police and emergency teams battling rough weather to reach affected villagers.

The houses in their area were not vandalised, they just fled out of fear. And now they are returning home... Our city is returning to normalcy. It has been seven days and the situation is peaceful... Our brotherhood will prevail,"" he said.This statement comes amid ongoing tensions following the violence in Murshidabad, which led to hundreds of families fleeing their homes. Islam's comments were echoed by TMC MP Khalilur Rahaman, who expressed relief over the return of those displaced by the violence. Rahaman said, ""It is a good thing that our friends who migrated from Dhuliyan are now coming back home out of their own will. The atmosphere in Dhuliyan is very peaceful. This is what everyone wants and it will continue like this.""The violence, which broke out in multiple areas of Murshidabad, prompted many families to flee to relief camps in neighbouring Malda. These families were reportedly brought back under heavy security, with the local government working to restore normalcy. However, the National Commission for Women (NCW) has raised concerns over the treatment of women and children during the unrest.The unrest was linked to protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act, with several villages in Murshidabad seeing significant damage. Despite the ongoing political tensions, Islam remains optimistic that the region will recover, and the return of displaced families marks a positive step toward restoring stability in the area.Vijaya Rahatkar, chairperson of the NCW, called on the West Bengal government to act urgently to address the suffering of the riot-affected people, particularly women. During a visit to the relief camps, Rahatkar described the distressing conditions faced by the displaced individuals, stating, ""The torture and suffering they faced was beyond imagination, having left a deep scar in their minds which need to be healed and addressed on an urgent basis with a humanitarian approach.""Rahatkar further criticised the state government for its lack of response, saying it was their ""moral duty"" to provide security and compensation for the victims. She emphasised the need for confidence-building measures and highlighted the calls from the affected women for greater security, including the establishment of a Border Security Force (BSF) camp in the area.","Amirul Islam, TMC MLA from Samsherganj, denies reports of vandalism in Murshidabad.

Farooq blames communal hatred for Bengal violence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/farooq-blames-communal-hatred-for-bengal-violence/articleshow/120461254.cms,"Bengal violence

SRINAGAR: National Conference president Farooq Abdullah blamed Sunday communal hatred for the recent violence in Bengal’s Murshidabad district, sparked by protests against the Waqf Act. The real threat to India comes not from China or Pakistan but from those spreading religious hatred, he said without naming anyone.“Didn’t you see how the bulldozers were run? How they demolished mosques, schools, houses of the community. What was their fault?” Abdullah said in Jammu after addressing a rally. “The Supreme Court had banned using bulldozers. How can they use it? Does it mean the law is different for them and me?”Abdullah refused comments on former RAW chief AS Dulat’s forthcoming book “The Chief Minister and the Spy”, which claims the NC president secretly supported the revocation of Article 370 in 2019, although he publicly denounced it as a betrayal. “I don’t want to talk about Dulat or his book,” he said.Rejecting speculation about a split in NC, Abdullah said reports that eight to 10 party MLAs were planning to defect were false. “No one is leaving the party. Instead, it is BJP that will go,” he said. “BJP lied about having their own CM in J&K. Where is their CM?”Reflecting on the abrogation of Article 370, Abdullah said some people in Jammu had celebrated without realising that the Dogra Maharaja had enacted special status laws in 1927 to protect local jobs and land. “After the abrogation, all jobs are going to outsiders who don’t know anything about J&K villages or topography,” he said.He also accused Centre of keeping J&K without an elected govt since PDP-BJP coalition ended in June 2018. “But by the grace of god an elected govt has now been formed in J&K (after assembly elections in Sept-Oct 2024),” he said. “You see a huge rush in the civil secretariat after the elected govt has taken over. It shows you people are real rulers.”Abdullah said nothing was done in J&K during the presidential rule (2018-2024), yet BJP is demanding accountability for just six months of CM Omar Abdullah’s govt.","National Conference president Farooq Abdullah blamed communal hatred for the recent violence in Bengal’s Murshidabad district. “Didn’t you see how the bulldozers were run?

Happy Passia arrest in US a major milestone: Punjab DGP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/happy-passia-arrest-in-us-a-major-milestone-says-punjab-dgp/articleshow/120414798.cms,"Punjab police achieved a major breakthrough with the arrest of Happy Passia in California

<p>Terror incidents involving Passia<br></p>

Police hope Passia will be deported, not extradited

First Shifted To UK, Then To US

Cases Against Passia

Locals in native village prefer silence

(With inputs from Yudhvir Rana in Amritsar)

CHANDIGARH: Punjab police had recently initiated the process for getting red corner notice (RCN) issued against gangster-terrorist Harpreet Singh , aka Happy Passia, who was arrested in Califonia by the US authorities. Passia faces more than 30 cases which include at least 15 related to series of grenade attacks on police establishments and other targets in Punjab in the last few months.A blue notice had already been issued against Passia, a key operative of ISI-backed Babbar Khalsa International (BKI) and close associate of Pakistan-based terrorist Harwinder Rinda. The blue notice relates to collecting additional information about a person's identity, location or activities in relation to a criminal investigation.Describing Passia's arrest as a major milestone in the police's sustained crackdown on ISI-backed terror networks , Punjab director-general of police Gaurav Yadav, in a post on X said: ""Between 2023 and 2025, Happy Passia played a central role in orchestrating targeted killings, grenade attacks on police establishments, and extortion across Punjab and other states,"" adding that his arrest on April 17, 2025 was the outcome of excellent international cooperation and exchange of information between the US and India.The Punjab Police consistently shares intelligence with the central agencies, the DGP said.The DGP, in a video message, said that Passia started his criminal career and activities in the organised crime with Jaggu Bhagwanpuria gang and his US-based associates Darman Kahlon and Amritpal. Subsequently, Passia came in contact with Rinda and carried out different acts by emerging as a primary node of terror modules at the behest of ISI.Passia was involved in many incidents after Sep 2024 in Punjab by masterminding his activities while being based in the US. ""Punjab police tracked him in a meticulous manner and dismantled his terror modules by doing complete mapping of his contacts,"" the DGP said, adding that an extensive dossier on Passia was shared with the central agencies and through appropriate channels the information was shared with US authorities, ultimately leading to his detention by the US authorities.""This is a manifestation that crime does not pay. Criminal has to come back and face the law. Punjab police is totally determined to keep the state safe and secure,"" DGP Yadav said.Punjab police are now hopeful that Passia would soon be deported like other illegal immigrants, without having to pursue a lengthy extradition procedure. A senior Punjab police officer told TOI: ""We believe that Passia will be deported like other illegal immigrants from the United States since US ICE was involved in his arrest. We don't think an extradition process would be required.""The officer added, ""If extradition route is taken, which is highly unlikely, it could take a long time. In extradition, on detention based on red corner notice, a request must be sent to the country where the wanted criminal is detained for a provisional arrest within 48 hours after getting information of detention. The accused is produced in a local court and is invariably sent to 60-day detention. Within these 60 days, a request by the State police through the Interpol division of the CBI must be made for extradition and the accused can contest that in the court in that country before the final decision is taken on the extradition.""In a report in Jan this year, TOI had highlighted that Passia, a matriculate who was behind the series of grenade attacks in Punjab, as per police, was using untraceable ""burner"" phone numbers with different country codes to evade tracking by the law enforcement agencies.Hailing from Passia village under Ramdas police station in Amritsar Rural police district, Passia who also goes by the alias of Jora, lived in the United Kingdom for a few months before illegally moving to the US through the Mexico border in 2021, as per a dossier on him.As per police, Passia has criminal associates residing in the UK - where he spent a few months in 2020-21 before illegally moving to the US - who provided him with burner phone numbers.Between Nov 2022 to April 2024, Passia was wanted in as many as 17 cases registered against him for alleged offences under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), Arms Act, NDPS Acts and others including extortions. The number of cases against him has nearly doubled from April last year. As per Punjab police, Passia is involved in orchestrating at least 15 of the 22 cases of grenade attacks in Punjab in recent months.In Jan, National Investigation Agency (NIA) had announced a reward of Rs 5 lakh against Passia for his alleged role in Sep 2024 grenade attack targeted at a retired Punjab police officer in Chandigarh, the investigation of which was taken over by the NIA. Same month, a US district court also issued an arrest warrant against Passia, who had been declared absconder in the case, on an application filed by the NIA.Fear remains palpable in his village, Passia, situated near Ramdas in Ajnala Tehsil of Punjab's Amritsar district, with most residents avoiding discussions about him, often citing vague reasons.The gangster's mother, Bhupinder Kaur, and sister, Kirandeep Kaur, are in prison on various charges. ""His criminal network has deep roots, and investigations are ongoing to dismantle it fully,"" Amritsar (Rural) senior superintendent of police (SSP) Maninder Singh said.One villager, Kuljit Kaur, cautiously shared that Happy's father, Gurwinderpal Singh, a truck driver, had passed away when Happy was barely five years old. ""After his mother and sister were arrested, their house has remained locked. That's all I know,"" she said, quickly ending the conversation.

Trump's tattoo theory to prove MS-13 gang ties: What experts say about President's renewed focus on ink,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-tattoo-theory-to-prove-ms-13-gang-ties-of-kilmar-abrego-garcia-what-experts-say-about-presidents-renewed-focus-on-ink/articleshow/120425771.cms,"Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s tattoos explained — as conspiracy theories run wild

President Donald Trump is increasingly citing tattoos as proof of gang membership in his push to deport undocumented migrants , especially Venezuelans, drawing criticism from experts who say the practice is both flawed and misleading.Also read: Trump citing image of Gracia's hand to claim MS-13 connection Donald Trump recently invoked the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia , a 29-year-old Maryland resident deported to El Salvador on March 15, despite an active immigration court order blocking his removal. Sharing an image of tattooed knuckles allegedly belonging to Abrego Garcia, Trump claimed: “This is the hand of the man that the Democrats feel should be brought back to the United States, because he is such ‘a fine and innocent person.’ They said he is not a member of MS-13, even though he’s got MS-13 tattooed on his knuckles... I must be allowed to do my job. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”.But multiple law enforcement officials and experts have warned against the Trump administration’s growing reliance on tattoos to determine gang affiliation — especially in the case of Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua . “A tattoo itself is never sufficient evidence to prove a person is a member of a criminal group,” said Joseph Kenny, chief of detectives at the New York Police Department, according to a NYT report.Court documents and investigative reports indicate that US immigration officials are now using a 10-point scoring system under an internal guide — where gang-related tattoos can earn four points — to determine deportability under the Alien Enemies Act. Eight points are sufficient for expedited removal without a hearing. In one case, Andry Jose Hernandez Romero, a Venezuelan makeup artist, was deported to El Salvador based solely on tattoos that read “Mom” and “Dad” inside crowns, according to a NYT report.While tattoos such as clocks, skulls, or train imagery have been linked to Tren de Aragua, five Venezuelan experts including police officials, academics, and a journalist told The New York Times that tattoos are not formal indicators of gang membership in Venezuelan street culture, where ink is common among young men regardless of affiliation.The case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia has further polarised debate. A New York Times video investigation debunked viral conspiracy theories that claimed his finger tattoos spelled out ""MS-13"" using a marijuana leaf, smiley face, cross, and skull. ICE officials reportedly told The Washington Post that they were unaware of such symbols being used by the gang. However, an ICE arrest report cited other tattoos — including skulls with eyes, ears, and mouths covered (a “see no evil” motif) and a devil with horns as signs of seniority within MS-13. His Chicago Bulls cap was also cited as evidence, according to the NYT report.Despite a Supreme Court ruling upholding the lower court’s order to reverse the deportation, the White House has remained firm. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday, “Abrego Garcia will never live in the United States of America,” accusing him of gang ties.Meanwhile, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele mocked allegations of mistreatment, posting photos of Abrego Garcia sipping margaritas with Senator Chris Van Hollen. “Kilmar Abrego Garcia, miraculously risen from the ‘death camps’ & ‘torture’, now sipping margaritas with Sen. Van Hollen,” he wrote on XLegal experts caution that even when tattoos are presented as evidence in court, they are rarely used as stand-alone proof. “A tattoo can be very telling. But are we going to base our decisions and law enforcement accusations and associations on a tattoo? Very, very unlikely,” said Ryan Brackley, assistant district attorney in Colorado’s Arapahoe County to NYTJohn Colello of the Los Angeles County DA’s gang homicide division agrees: “Facts and context are obviously important. Tattoos alone, or lack of tattoo, do not necessarily mean a person is, or is not, a gang member”","President Donald Trump is increasingly citing tattoos as proof of gang membership in his push to deport undocumented migrants, especially Venezuelans.

"MS 13 Tattoo: What is the truth of Kilmar Abrego Garcia's MS-13 tattoo, a photo that Trump shared?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-the-truth-of-kilmar-abrego-garcias-ms-13-tattoo-a-photo-that-trump-shared/articleshow/120442009.cms,"Donald Trump shows a photo of an MS-13 tattoo on Garcia's hand, the same that gets covered by emojis in a photo posted by his wife and is visible in another (right) photo.

What is the truth of the photoshopped photo?



Poll Do you believe that the photo shared by Donald Trump is indeed photoshopped? No, it's authentic. Yes, it's photoshopped.

What is MS-13?



Donald Trump has been accused of sharing a fake image of the knuckles Kilmar Abrego Garcia which shows MS-13 written on it. Social media users pointed out that the letters M, S and the numbers 1 and 3 are superimposed on the photo and those letters and numbers do not appear on any other photos of Garcia. Garcia is a Maryland father who came to the US illegally but there was a 2019 court order that shielded him from being deported. When the Trump administration sent a number of Tren de Aragua and MS-13 members to Venezuela's notorious prison, Garcia was also sent along with them.In a court case, the Trump administration claimed that he was wrongly deported to El Salvador, following which the court ruled that he should be brought back. But now the White House has made it clear that the person is not coming back. As defense, the Trump administration said firstly the ball is in El Salvador's court as they will have to decide whether they would release their prisoner, which Salvador president Nayib Bukele denied. Secondly, the Trump administration released several pieces of evidence to establish that Garcia is an MS-13 member, and a criminal.The words M, S and 13 are not part of the tattoo and they were used in the photo that Trump shared to denote the meaning of the tattoo. On the knuckles of Garcia's four fingers on his left hand, there are tattoos of four symbols which stand for M, S, 1 and 3.“This is the hand of the man that the Democrats feel should be brought back to the United States, because he is such “a fine and innocent person.” They said he is not a member of MS-13, even though he’s got MS-13 tattooed onto his knuckles, and two Highly Respected Courts found that he was a member of MS-13, beat up his wife, etc. I was elected to take bad people out of the United States, among other things. I must be allowed to do my job. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” the 78-year-old wrote.Another photo has gone viral in this context, in which those tattoos are hidden by love emojis posted by his wife Jennifer Vasquez Sura.MS-13, or Mara Salvatrucha, is a transnational criminal gang that originated in Los Angeles, California, in the 1980s. Formed by Salvadoran immigrants fleeing civil war, it initially aimed to protect community members from other gangs. Over time, it evolved into a violent criminal organization. The name ""Mara Salvatrucha"" likely derives from ""mara"" (gang), ""Salva"" (Salvador), and ""trucha"" (street smarts), with ""13"" possibly indicating its alliance with the Mexican Mafia, as M is the 13th letter of the alphabet.","Kilmar Abrego Garcia is a Maryland father who came to the US illegally but there was a 2019 court order that shielded him from being deported.

"'You are tubelights': Owaisi’s swipe at BJP after Nishikant Dubey's remark on SC, CJI Khanna",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/you-are-tubelights-owaisis-swipe-at-bjp-after-nishikant-dubeys-remark-on-sc-cji-khanna/articleshow/120447169.cms,"Poll How concerned are you about the threats to the judiciary mentioned by Owaisi? Somewhat concerned Very concerned

NEW DELHI: AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi mocked BJP leaders as ""tubelights"" on Sunday, following controversial remarks by BJP MP Nishikant Dubey against the Supreme Court and the Chief Justice of India.Owaisi reminded the BJP of Article 142 of the Constitution, which grants the Supreme Court power to deliver complete justice in matters before it.""You people (BJP) are tubelights... Do you even know what Article 142 is? It was framed by Dr. BR Ambedkar,"" Owaisi said, accusing the BJP of threatening the judiciary with religious warfare.You people are in power and have become so radicalised that you're now threatening the court with a religious war. Modi ji, if you don't stop these people, the country will become weak. The country won’t forgive you, and tomorrow, you won’t be in power,” he added.This comes in response to Nishikant Dubey’s comments suggesting that Parliament should stop functioning if the apex court acts like a law-making body.Taking aim at the Supreme Court, Dubey said, “Kanoon yadi Supreme Court hi banayega to Sansad Bhavan band kar dena chahiye” (If the Supreme Court is going to make the laws, then the Parliament should be shut down).Targeting the Chief Justice of India, he added, “Sanjiv Khanna is responsible for all the civil wars happening in this country.”Echoing similar sentiments, BJP MP Dinesh Sharma said, “There is an apprehension among the public that when Dr. B.R. Ambedkar wrote the Constitution, the roles of the Legislature and the Judiciary were clearly defined. According to the Constitution, no one can direct the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, and the President has already given her assent to the law. No one can challenge the President, as the President is supreme…”These remarks come at a sensitive time, as the Supreme Court is currently hearing multiple petitions challenging the constitutionality of the Waqf (Amendment) Act, which was passed by Parliament in early April.In response to the court’s concerns, the Centre has agreed to temporarily hold off on implementing certain controversial provisions of the law until the next hearing.Meanwhile, the BJP has “outrightly rejected” and distanced itself from the remarks made by its MPs, and members have been cautioned against making such statements in the future.“The statements made by BJP MPs Nishikant Dubey and Dinesh Sharma regarding the judiciary and the Chief Justice have no connection whatsoever with the Bharatiya Janata Party . These are their personal views. The BJP neither agrees with nor endorses such statements. The BJP outrightly rejects them,” BJP national president J.P. Nadda said in a post on X.“The Bharatiya Janata Party has always respected the judiciary and has wholeheartedly accepted its orders and suggestions. As a party, we believe that the Supreme Court, along with all other courts in the country, is an integral part of our democracy and a strong pillar in safeguarding the Constitution. I have directed both of them—and everyone else—to refrain from making such statements,” he added.","Owaisi reminded the BJP of Article 142 of the Constitution, which grants the Supreme Court power to deliver complete justice in matters before it.

TAIPEI: A Chinese cruise ship sailed within just two nautical miles (3.7km) of Taiwan's Hengchun Peninsula this week, prompting concern from observers and authorities about a possible ""gray zone"" tactic by Beijing, Taipei Times reported.The incident was reported by Taiwan ADIZ , a civilian Facebook group that monitors Chinese military activity near Taiwan, which posted footage showing the vessel clearly visible from the shoreline in Pingtung County.The ship was identified as the Gulangyu, a Bermuda-registered cruise vessel with a capacity of up to 1,800 passengers. Taiwan ADIZ noted that if fully occupied, the number of people on board would be roughly equivalent to a battalion-sized military unit.""If such events become routine, they could pose a serious threat to Taiwan's security,"" the group wrote, pointing to the potential for such vessels to be repurposed in conflict scenarios.Footage allegedly filmed by a passenger on board was later posted to Chinese social media, showing views of the Hengchun Peninsula overlaid with the message in simplified Chinese: ""Taiwan is China,"" reported Taipei Times.Ocean Affairs Council Minister Kuan Bi-ling responded to the incident on Friday, saying the public should stay alert, calling it part of China's broader ""gray zone"" strategy--coercive actions that stop short of armed conflict. She added that the government has launched a cross-agency mechanism to monitor maritime activity and would enhance coordination with the Maritime and Port Bureau and national security agencies.Kuan said that after entering Taiwan's territorial waters around 2pm on Wednesday, the Gulangyu was tracked by the Coast Guard Administration and later exited toward the northeast without altering its speed or course. The incident was believed to be a ""united front"" effort by Beijing, she added.The government is developing a dedicated intelligence and tracking database for vessels operating in sensitive areas, including undersea cable zones, particularly those with Chinese capital or operating under flags of convenience, Taipei Times reported.The coast guard is charged with monitoring such ships, while the Maritime and Port Bureau enforces the Regulations on the Administration of Innocent Passage of Foreign Vessels.","A Chinese cruise ship sailed within just two nautical miles (3.7km) of Taiwan's Hengchun Peninsula.

BOKARO: An intense gunfight between security forces and Maoist insurgents that began Sunday night on Luggu Hill in Bokaro district 's Gomia block has resulted in the deaths of eight Maoists, according to the CRPF Troops recovered eight bodies along with a cache of weapons, including one AK-series rifle, one SLR, three INSAS rifles, one pistol, and eight country-made Bharmar rifles. No injuries were reported among security personnel. The firing has ceased, and search operations are currently underway.Jharkhand police spokesperson Amol Homkar maintained a cautious stance, stating, ""While we received information about potential Maoist casualties, final confirmation will only be possible after the operation concludes and forces return from the site.""The encounter began when a joint task force, comprising CoBRA, Jharkhand Jaguar, CRPF, and district police personnel, acted on intelligence about Maoist presence in the area. The ensuing operation led to a heavy exchange of fire with the extremists.The security forces completely cordoned off the Luggu area, where they are reportedly engaging with a Maoist squad believed to be under the leadership of Central Committee member Vivek and Sahdev Sao.Continuous gunfire was reverberating across Lugu Mountain as the operation intensified. The situation remains volatile as security forces maintain their strategic positions around the encounter site.In a separate incident, 17 Maoists were killed in an encounter in the forests of Sukma district in Bastar division of Chhattisgarh on March 29, 2025. Four security personnel—three from the DRG force and a CRPF personnel—sustained minor injuries in the encounter, and their condition is stated to be stable.The toll of Naxals killed this year touches 132 in Chhattisgarh. The development comes a day before Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Bilaspur district in the state.There are 11 women cadres and a senior-rank Maoist commander among those killed, and security forces have recovered a large cache of firearms from the encounter site.Hailing the success of security forces, Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Saturday said, “Another strike on Naxalism! Our security agencies have neutralized 17 Naxalites and recovered a massive cache of automatic weapons in the operation in Sukma. Under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi ji, we have resolved to eradicated Naxalism before Mar 31, 2026.”Shah further made an appeal to Naxalites, “My appeal to those with arms is that weapons and violence cannot bring change: only peace and development can.”","A gunfight between security forces and Maoist insurgents has resulted in the deaths of eight Maoists.

Severe weather prompts school closures

JAMMU: Mashkoor, a groom in Jammu and Kashmir, walked to his wedding venue on Monday along with his procession after landslides triggered by heavy rainfall shut down the Jammu-Srinagar National Highway (NH 44).The groom explained that they were forced to walk because of the heavy rainfall the previous day, which led to the road closure.According to the groom, the group began their journey at 6 am, having parked their cars behind, and decided to continue the rest of the way on foot.""It is my wedding day... This is the situation because of the heavy rainfall yesterday. We have to go on foot. We started travelling at 6 am. We parked our cars behind and now we will walk the rest of the way. We still have around 7-8 km more to walk. We would bring the bride the same way, as the roads are not cleared.

Numerous vehicles were stranded as debris from mountainsides blocked approximately twelve locations along the route between Nashri and Banihal.Due to persistent severe weather conditions and predictions, Kashmir valley schools will suspend all classwork on Monday, April 21, announced Sakina Itoo, the education minister of Jammu and Kashmir (J-K).The announcement follows ongoing heavy rainfall, cloudbursts and landslides affecting various regions of Jammu and Kashmir, particularly in mountainous areas.The Srinagar Meteorological Centre has issued a yellow alert or 'watch' for the majority of districts, with the exception of Jammu, Poonch, Kathua, Muzzafarabad and Mirpur.","Groom walks to wedding venue after landslides shut down Jammu-Srinagar National Highway.

NEW DELHI: At least six people died and two others were injured when a car collided with a tree at the Shukla Bhujouli intersection in Uttar Pradesh on Sunday.The victims were on their way to a wedding ceremony in Devgaon village.The superintendent of police, along with a police team, inspected the accident site, according to Kushinagar Police.In a separate incident, A 42-year-old motorcyclist, Naveen Gupta, died on the spot after being hit by a speeding Innova involved in a suspected street race with a BMW in the Kidwainagar area late Friday night.The incident occurred around 10:56 pm near the South Cricket Academy. Eyewitnesses reported that both cars were moving at extremely high speed, appearing to be racing each other. As the BMW surged ahead, the Innova—traveling at nearly 100 km/h—collided head-on with Gupta, who was coming from the opposite direction.The impact was so forceful that Gupta was thrown nearly 20 meters and crashed into a parked car, succumbing to his injuries instantly. Kabir, the owner of the parked vehicle, said he rushed out upon hearing the sound of the impact and found Gupta lying severely injured beside his car.The driver of the Innova fled the scene immediately. However, CCTV footage from the area helped police track down the vehicle, as its number plate had fallen off at the accident site. Upon investigation, authorities discovered that the Innova carried a ‘Govt of India’ label and bore the insignia of a central investigation agency.Police have since arrested the driver and are further probing the case.","A car collided with a tree at the Shukla Bhujouli intersection in Uttar Pradesh.

The United States government planned to withdraw another $1 billion in federal grants and health research contracts from Harvard University, escalating conflict over institutional autonomy, as reported by The Wall Street Journal.The administration announced last Monday its decision to suspend $2.2 billion in multi-year grants and $60 million in contract value after Harvard's refusal to comply with policy requirements.Officials were caught off guard when the university disclosed a letter from the Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism, according to the Journal's Sunday report.""Before Monday, the administration was planning to treat Harvard more leniently than Columbia University, but now officials want to apply even more pressure to the nation's most prominent university, according to the people,"" the Journal reports.""People familiar with Harvard's response say there was no agreement to keep the letter private, and that its contents – including requirements that Harvard allow federal-government oversight of admissions, hiring and the ideology of students and staff – were a nonstarter.""Columbia University yielded to administration demands last month by implementing policy changes, including protest limitations, new disciplinary measures, and an immediate review of Middle East studies, following President Donald Trump's withdrawal of $400 million in federal funding over campus demonstrations.According to the Journal's Sunday report, sources close to the situation indicated the task force anticipated Harvard would similarly comply with its requirements.The funding withdrawal threat represents the latest development in the ongoing dispute between the institution and the government.Harvard, now representing resistance to Trump's policies, firmly declined the demands in an April 11 letter, with President Alan M. Garber stating that the ""University will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.""The letter's demands included prohibiting masks at campus demonstrations, revising merit-based recruitment and admissions processes, and reducing authority of staff ""more committed to activism than scholarship.""The university leadership maintains these requirements exceed federal authority, with most ""represent direct governmental regulation of the 'intellectual conditions' at Harvard"" rather than addressing antisemitism.On Wednesday, CNN reported the internal revenue service's plans to withdraw the university's tax-exempt status, according to two informed sources.

"Thousands accessed sensitive White House info, floor plans under Biden and Trump admin: Report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/thousands-accessed-sensitive-white-house-info-floor-plans-under-biden-and-trump-admin-report/articleshow/120468746.cms,"More than 11,000 federal employees had access to sensitive documents, including White House floor plans and vendor banking information, due to a digital security lapse that spanned several years, according to a report by The Washington Post.The breach, which began during the administration of former President Joe Biden and also involved the current administration of President Donald Trump, involved at least 15 files stored in a Google Drive folder managed by the General Services Administration (GSA).Officials said the documents included potentially sensitive material such as proposed blast door designs for the White House Visitor Center and files marked as “controlled unclassified information” (CUI).The files were accessible to the entire GSA workforce — over 11,000 employees — and some were editable. The GSA has launched an internal investigation and a cybersecurity incident report is underway.The oversharing began in early 2021, during the tenure of former President Joe Biden, and continued until as recently as last week. Internal investigations and a cybersecurity incident report have since been launched.“This kind of mistake is a challenge across all administrations,” said Michael Williams, a Syracuse University professor who studies international security. “These are absolutely not documents you want shared with 11,200 people.”Although it’s unclear whether the East and West Wing floor plans were formally classified, experts say documents containing detailed layouts or embedded security infrastructure would normally be closely guarded. “Even if not formally classified, they would be restricted for obvious security reasons,” said Steven Aftergood, a former security policy analyst with the Federation of American Scientists.One of the earliest breaches occurred in March 2021 when a safety survey with East Wing blueprints was shared agency-wide. A similar incident followed involving the West Wing, which includes the Oval Office, Situation Room, and Cabinet Room. These files reportedly remained accessible for years.The GSA said it has protocols for detecting inappropriate file sharing, including automated scans and mandatory annual training. “Internal controls are not perfect,” a longtime employee told The Post. “But it’s not like we’re letting things happen unchecked.”Nine of the 15 files were marked as CUI — a designation for sensitive but unclassified material — and at least ten could be both viewed and edited by anyone within the agency. The breach included not only architectural blueprints but also courthouse layouts, project manuals, and financial records.The GSA’s Office of Inspector General uncovered the lapse during an audit of the agency’s Google Drive usage. The issue was flagged to the IT incident response team last Tuesday, and by Thursday, file-sharing permissions had been revoked. Investigators have so far been unable to reach the owners of the compromised files.According to WSJ, Neither the White House nor the GSA has issued a comment. A representative for former President Biden also declined to respond.This incident adds to a string of security missteps under both administrations. During President Trump’s tenure, officials mistakenly included The Atlantic's editor-in-chief in a group chat discussing military planning and used personal Gmail accounts for sensitive communication. In contrast, a 2023 special counsel report criticised former President Biden for storing classified notebooks at his residence.Meanwhile, a separate controversy is unfolding at the Pentagon. US defense secretary Pete Hegseth is under scrutiny for allegedly sharing classified airstrike plans in a private Signal group that included his wife, brother, and personal lawyer, according to The New York Times.The chat reportedly contained flight schedules for F/A-18 Hornets involved in US operations in Yemen. Unlike a previous leak in March — where a journalist was mistakenly added — the Signal group was reportedly created by Hegseth himself.This is the second time Hegseth has been accused of mishandling classified military information. The Pentagon inspector general is now investigating both incidents. Those in the Signal group reportedly include Hegseth’s wife Jennifer, a former Fox News producer; his brother Phil; and his personal lawyer Tim Parlatore.","The breach involved at least 15 files stored in a Google Drive folder managed by the General Services Administration.

Signalgate: A slip that showed Vance’s true views

: Backing Trump’s Territorial Ambition

Clashing with China: Peasants comment sparks outrage

The Cheney comparison—and 2028 ambitions

The unconventional vice president

JD Vance has taken on the traditionally subdued role of US Vice President with an unusually aggressive posture, stepping far beyond the ceremonial expectations of the office in his first 100 days. At just 40, the former Ohio senator has inserted himself into world affairs in ways few of his predecessors dared, quickly becoming the public face of President Donald Trump's most controversial foreign policy stances.“Vance is unfailingly loyal to the president, knows not to overshadow the boss, and acts as an attack dog,” said Matt Dallek, a professor of political management at George Washington University. “But he also makes in-your-face comments that represent something of a departure from his predecessors.”Vance’s global profile exploded in February when he confronted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office. As tensions simmered over continued US aid to Ukraine , Vance accused Zelensky of being ungrateful.“Have you said ‘thank you’ once, this entire meeting?” Vance demanded, calling the Ukrainian leader “disrespectful.” The moment quickly escalated as President Trump joined in, berating Zelensky in front of reporters.Vance later denied that the exchange was part of any coordinated plan to play “bad cop,” but the spectacle cemented his position as Trump's ideological bulldog on foreign policy.Since taking office, there has been speculation over which version of Vance would show up in Washington. Was he the Appalachian chronicler of Hillbilly Elegy, the Marine Corps veteran, the Yale Law School graduate, the Catholic convert, or the Silicon Valley investor?At one point, he was also a staunch Trump critic, comparing the former president to Adolf Hitler. But since entering politics, Vance has undergone a sharp transformation, aligning himself completely with Trump’s agenda and presenting himself as the ultimate MAGA loyalist.Vance’s first major foreign appearance came at the Munich Security Conference , where he delivered a strident address targeting what he described as Europe's ""woke"" culture and overreliance on US defense.“There’s a new sheriff in town,” he told startled allies, signaling that America’s foreign policy would now take a more confrontational and transactional turn under the second Trump administration .In a moment that revealed more than intended, a journalist was accidentally added to a Signal group chat discussing US airstrikes on Yemen’s Huthi rebels. In the conversation, Vance lamented, “I just hate bailing out Europe again,” criticizing US military involvement that he argued disproportionately benefits the EU.The leak, dubbed “Signalgate,” showed the vice president’s skepticism of traditional alliances and his preference for a nationalist, America-first approach.Adding fuel to another long-standing Trump fascination, Vance visited Greenland to lend credence to the president's renewed interest in purchasing the Danish-ruled territory. The trip was condemned as provocative by Denmark and NATO officials, but Vance defended it unapologetically.“We can’t just ignore the president’s desires,” he said during the trip, framing the visit as a gesture of loyalty to Trump’s geopolitical instincts.His wife, Usha Vance, made a rare public appearance during the visit, offering a glimpse into the personal toll of Vance’s high-profile role. “It’s a very lonely, lonely world,” she admitted in an interview, reflecting on the pressure and isolation that comes with the job.Vance has also drawn fire from Beijing for controversial comments about America’s debt dependence. In a speech, he claimed the US was “borrowing money from Chinese peasants,” a remark that triggered an official rebuke from China’s Foreign Ministry.Comparisons between Vance and former Vice President Dick Cheney are increasingly common. Like Cheney, who shaped George W. Bush’s foreign policy and championed the Iraq War, Vance is viewed as a central player in the Trump administration’s international strategy—particularly in pushing back against aid to Ukraine and resisting new US military engagements.Speculation is already swirling about Vance’s political future. He has not ruled out a 2028 presidential run but insists he would only move forward after consulting Trump.Trump, however, hasn’t endorsed the idea. “No,” the president told Fox News’s Bret Baier in February when asked if Vance was his chosen successor. “But he’s very capable.”In just three months, JD Vance has proven he is no placeholder. From confrontations with world leaders to unapologetic defenses of Trump’s most polarizing ideas, Vance is not only redefining the role of vice president—he’s auditioning for something bigger.Whether the world is ready for that remains to be seen. But one thing is clear: JD Vance is not here to wait in the wings.","JD Vance has taken on the traditionally subdued role of US Vice President with an unusually aggressive posture.

US President Donald Trump on Easter Sunday issued a stern message to international trade partners, posting an eight-point list of alleged “non-tariff cheating” practices that he claimed could damage relations with the United States. Among the listed tactics were currency manipulation , government subsidies, counterfeiting, and transshipping to evade tariffs.The post comes shortly after Trump announced a 90-day suspension of reciprocal tariffs for most US trade allies—excluding China. Speaking to reporters last Thursday in the Oval Office, Trump said discussions with Beijing were ongoing. “Yeah, we're talking to China.

They take a bowling ball from 20 feet up in the air and drop it on the hood of the car,” Trump said. “If the hood dents, the car doesn’t qualify. It’s horrible.”While the White House previously described the remark as a joke, Trump’s decision to repeat it underscores his ongoing grievances over what he views as protectionist trade barriers against American goods.","US President Donald Trump on Easter Sunday issued a stern message to international trade partners.

Ada, Oklahoma Hit By Another Tornado

Easter Sunday turned tragic for many communities in Texas and Oklahoma as a slow-moving storm system brought tornadoes, heavy rain, and large hail. Three people died, including a woman and a 12-year-old boy whose car was swept away in floodwaters in Moore, Oklahoma. Another person was killed in Spaulding when a tornado hit the rural town and destroyed several homes, reported Associated Press.The national weather service reported 17 tornado events on Saturday, five of which were confirmed in south-central Oklahoma. Some of the tornadoes were classified as EF1, with wind speeds reaching up to 177 km/h.One small town, still recovering from a tornado in March, was hit again. In Ada, a town of about 16,000 people, roofs were torn off buildings, windows shattered, and trees uprooted.In Marshall County, emergency crews said a tornado travelled over 10 kilometres, damaging at least 20 homes. Some were completely destroyed. No injuries were reported in that area.The city of Moore, with around 63,000 residents, experienced what police called a “historic weather event”. Dozens of high-water incidents were reported. Emergency services were stretched thin as they responded to stranded vehicles and rising floodwaters.In Texas, tornadoes in Parker County damaged several homes. Photos on social media showed roofs ripped off and debris scattered across properties.As the storm moved northeast on Sunday, the threat shifted to Arkansas, Missouri, and parts of the Midwest. Thousands in Missouri lost power. Forecasters warned that more rain is expected in the plains this week, raising fears of further flooding due to already saturated ground and swollen streams.","A slow-moving storm system brought tornadoes, heavy rain, and large hail.

The UK's Ministry of Defense (MoD) announced on Sunday that Royal Air Force (RAF) fighter jets intercepted Russian aircraft flying close to the airspace of Nato (North Atlantic Treaty Organization).According to the ministry, RAF fighters intercepted the Russian aircraft as part of the United Kingdom's contribution to Nato’s enhanced air policing in the region.The UK MoD said in a statement , ""Two RAF Typhoons were scrambled from Malbork Air Base in Poland on Tuesday to intercept a Russian Ilyushin Il-20M 'Coot-A' intelligence aircraft over the Baltic Sea. Whilst on Thursday, another two Typhoons scrambled from the base, to intercept an unknown aircraft leaving Kaliningrad air space and close to Nato airspace .""It added, ""The intercepts marked the RAF’s first scramble as part of Operation Chessman and come just weeks after the aircraft arrived in eastern Poland to begin their deployment alongside Sweden in defence of Nato’s Eastern Flank.""""Operation Chessman"" is the United Kingdom's involvement in Nato's enhanced air policing.Minister for the armed forces, Luke Pollard, said the UK is ""unshakeable in its commitment to Nato.""Pollard stated, ""With Russian aggression growing and security threats on the rise, we are stepping up to reassure our allies, deter adversaries and protect our national security through our Plan for Change.

NEW DELHI: In his Easter wishes on Sunday, US President Donald Trump took a swipe at the left 'lunatics', 'weak' judiciary as well as his predecessor 'sleepy' Joe Biden.""Happy Easter to all, including the Radical Left Lunatics who are fighting and scheming so hard to bring Murderers, Drug Lords, Dangerous Prisoners, the Mentally Insane, and well known MS-13 Gang Members and Wife Beaters, back into our Country,"" wrote Trump on Truth Social.A day after a US judge halted Trump's policy allowing it to rapidly deport hundreds of migrants to countries other than their own, Trump took a swipe in his Easter greeting and said, ""Happy Easter also to the WEAK and INEFFECTIVE Judges and Law Enforcement Officials who are allowing this sinister attack on our Nation to continue, an attack so violent that it will never be forgotten!""Trump also took the opportunity to slam Biden and wrote, ""Sleepy Joe Biden purposefully allowed Millions of CRIMINALS to enter our Country, totally unvetted and unchecked, through an Open Borders Policy that will go down in history as the single most calamitous act ever perpetrated upon America. He was, by far, our WORST and most Incompetent President, a man who had absolutely no idea what he was doing -- But to him, and to the person that ran and manipulated the Auto Pen (perhaps our REAL President!), and to all of the people who CHEATED in the 2020 Presidential Election in order to get this highly destructive Moron Elected, I wish you, with great love, sincerity, and affection, a very Happy Easter!!!""A Christian festival, Easter is a celebration of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead and is celebrated three days after Good Friday. It symbolises the victory over death, a promise of eternal life, hope and renewal.Every year, Easter is celebrated on the first Sunday after the full moon following the spring equinox-- and this usually falls between March 22 and April 25.","US President Donald Trump took a swipe at the left 'lunatics', 'weak' judiciary as well as his predecessor'sleepy' Joe Biden.

What is the ""bowling ball test""

?

Japan may ease auto rules

United States president Donald Trump on Easter Sunday listed on social media eight examples of what he called "" non-tariff cheating "". Among them was the familiar Japanese “bowling ball test,” which he claims is used to reject American-made cars.The unusual claim first came up in 2018. “It’s the bowling ball test,” Trump said at that time. “They take a bowling ball from 20 feet in the air and drop it on the hood. If it dents, the car doesn’t qualify. It's horrible,” he said, writes MSNBC.At the time, White House officials dismissed it as a joke. However, reports later revealed that Trump had repeatedly mentioned the test in private meetings.The origin remains unclear, but one theory links it to a Nissan advertisement that showed bowling balls hitting a car’s surface.Though Japan has used regulatory barriers in the past, there is no evidence of a real “bowling ball test.”The recent post comes as Japan considers relaxing import safety rules to ease ongoing trade friction. According to Nikkei Asia, Tokyo may soften crash test requirements as a way to reduce trade tensions with Washington.Differences in safety standards between the two countries have long created trade friction. As part of the now-defunct Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), Japan had agreed to lower some import restrictions. Trump withdrew from the deal in 2017, shortly after taking office.","Donald Trump listed eight examples of what he called "" non-tariff cheating"" Among them was the familiar Japanese “bowling ball test,” which he claims is used to reject American-made cars.

Poll How do you feel about the hate calls received by Imran Chaudhary? It's part of public discourse. It's unacceptable.

Imran Chaudhary , a property developer in Texas, has alleged receiving hate calls almost daily over a proposed housing and community project. The threats escalated after his team revealed early plans for a new community development in East Texas, reported news agency AFP.The proposal includes 1,000 homes, a hospital, a community centre, and a place of worship. The project is meant to serve a growing population near East Plano.But opponents, including Republican lawmakers, are not convinced. Senator John Cornyn claimed the site may violate the rights of Jewish and Christian Texans. Governor Greg Abbott went further, calling it an attempt to bring in Sharia law. “To be clear, Sharia law is not allowed in Texas,” Abbott wrote on social media.Texas has laws that reject the use of foreign legal systems like Sharia.Chaudhary said the development is not for a specific community. “Anybody can use our services,” he told AFP. He said all legal guidelines are being followed, and even invited Abbott to a barbeque to ease tensions — but got no reply.The EPIC community, which began in Plano 20 years ago, says the new land near Josephine is simply a much-needed expansion.Still, protests and social media misinformation have slowed down the approval process. At a recent town hall, critics voiced fears about the nature of the project. Chaudhary and his team say they remain committed, but worry about rising hostility.","Property developer Imran Chaudhary has alleged receiving hate calls almost daily over a proposed housing and community project.

Who is Darya Kozyreva- 19 year old Russian jailed for criticising Ukraine war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/who-is-darya-kozyreva-19-year-old-russian-jailed-for-criticising-ukraine-war/articleshow/120451383.cms,"AP photo

Teen Activist Jailed in Russia for Anti-War Graffiti & Poetry | Darya Kozyreva Sentenced | News9

Who is Darya Kozyreva?

The 19-year-old Kozyreva from St Petersburg, Russia.

She was first detained in 2022 for anti-war graffiti while still in school.

Koxyreva was expelled from university in 2023 for a critical social media post.

In August 2024, a second case was filed against Kozyreva. This followed an interview with Radio Free Europe in which she openly called the war in Ukraine “monstrous” and “criminal.”

(This is a top Google Trends topic)

A court in St Petersburg has sentenced 19-year-old Darya Kozyreva to two years and eight months in a penal colony after she was accused of repeatedly discrediting the Russian military. The decision came after she pasted a verse from a well-known Ukrainian poem onto a statue of the poet Taras Shevchenko.The poem, titled My Testament, included a call to “break your heavy chains” and “water with the tyrants’ blood. The freedom you have gained.” Authorities viewed this as a political act aimed at criticising the Russian state.Rights groups including Memorial and Amnesty International have called her a political prisoner. They argue that her punishment is meant to suppress any anti-war expression, especially among young people. Her lawyer has said they are likely to appeal the verdict.Meanwhile, Reuters shared video of Kozyreva smiling and waving to supporters as she left the courtroom — a moment of defiance amid growing pressure on Russia’s youth to remain silent.","Darya Kozyreva, 19, was sentenced to two years and eight months in a penal colony.

Signal chat 2.0: Was Yemen war plan discussed with family by US defense secretary in ‘Team Huddle’? 10 things to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/team-huddle-us-defence-secretary-pete-hegseth-sent-yemen-war-plans-to-family-via-2nd-signal-chat-10-things-to-know/articleshow/120469280.cms,"US President Donald Trump and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth

New York Times reported.

Trump To Fire Pentagon Boss? Hegseth LEAKS Houthi Attack Details To Wife, Brother | Report

10 things to know about Hegseth's Signal chat leaks:

The chat group, named ""Defense | Team Huddle,"" included 13 participants: Hegseth, his wife Jennifer, his brother Phil, and his personal lawyer.

Sensitive information shared in the chat included warplane launch times and strike packages related to the March airstrike on Yemen's Houthi militants.

The chat was conducted on Hegseth's personal device, not a government-issued one, raising further security concerns.

The earlier incident prompted internal upheaval within the Pentagon, with several top officials resigning or being placed on leave amid the ongoing probe.

The use of Signal for discussing sensitive military operations contravenes Pentagon regulations, which prohibit the transmission of non-public Department of Defense information via unauthorized apps.

The earlier Signal chat that which was revealed by the Atlantic's Jeffery Goldberg, was titled ""Houthi PC small group,"" included top officials like Vice President JD Vance.

The leaks included military plans involving the Panama Canal, Red Sea deployments, and suspended intelligence-sharing with Ukraine.

Journalist Jeffrey Goldberg was mistakenly added to the encrypted Signal chat, giving him direct access to classified discussions.

Dan Caldwell was removed from the Pentagon after being suspended over leaks of sensitive defence information.

Darin Selnick, another senior Trump official, was also placed on administrative leave and escorted out.



What Trump, White House had said earlier

US defence secretary Pete Hegseth has once again found himself in the eye of a political storm following revelations that he shared sensitive military details about a March airstrike on Yemen’s Houthi militants in a private Signal chat with his wife, brother, and personal lawyer.The group, dubbed ""Defense | Team Huddle,"" comprised 13 individuals, including Hegseth's wife Jennifer, a former Fox News producer, and his brother Phil, a Department of Homeland Security liaison at the Pentagon,The chat reportedly contained specific information such as warplane launch times and strike packages, raising serious concerns about the handling of classified materials.This disclosure follows an earlier incident where Hegseth shared similar sensitive information in another Signal chat that included top Trump administration officials and, mistakenly, a journalist. The Atlantic published the contents of that chat, revealing detailed operational plans for the Yemen strike, which experts assert would typically be classified at the highest levels. Hegseth had denied any wrongdoing, saying, ""Nobody was texting war plans,"" and attributing the reports to media bias.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt had described the Signal messaging thread as “a policy discussion, a sensitive policy discussion among high level cabinet officials and senior staff.” Defending the Secretary of Defense, she asked, “Do you trust the secretary of defense who was nominated for this role, voted by the United States Senate into this role, who has served in combat, honourably served our nation in uniform or do you trust Jeffrey Goldberg?”When questioned about the thread, Trump distanced himself, saying he’s “not sure” whether the information shared was classified: “Well, that’s what I’ve heard. I don’t know. I’m not sure, you have to ask the various people involved.” Trump added that Waltz had taken responsibility for the error, but dismissed Hegseth’s involvement: “How do you bring Hegseth into it? He had nothing to do with it.”The White House stated Trump had seen Hegseth’s texts. “It’s all a witch-hunt,” Trump said. While the National Security Council confirmed the thread’s authenticity, Leavitt posted: “The Atlantic has conceded: these were NOT ‘war plans.’”","US defence secretary Pete Hegseth shared sensitive military details about a March airstrike on Yemen’s Houthi militants in a private Signal chat with his wife, brother, and personal lawyer.

"Houthi-controlled areas hit by US airstrikes, 12 killed",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/houthi-controlled-areas-hit-by-us-airstrikes-12-killed/articleshow/120469163.cms,"US airstrikes on Yemen ’s capital, Sanaa , killed 12 people and wounded 30 others, the Houthi rebels said on Monday. The attacks reportedly hit a market in the Furwah neighborhood of the Shuub district, an area previously targeted by American forces. Other regions across the country were also struck overnight.These strikes come just days after a US attack on the Ras Isa fuel port killed at least 74 people and injured 171. The recent wave of airstrikes follows renewed talks in Rome between the US and Iran over Tehran’s advancing nuclear program, something Washington has linked to Houthi actions in the region.The US is targeting the Houthis due to their repeated attacks on shipping vessels in the Red Sea, a critical global trade route, and their threats against Israel. The group, aligned with Iran and calling itself part of the “Axis of Resistance,” is the only one among Iran backed groups still capable of striking Israel.The new campaign, launched under President Donald Trump, appears more aggressive than actions taken under President Joe Biden. It began after the Houthis warned they would resume targeting ships linked to Israel in response to the blockade of aid to Gaza.Between November 2023 and January 2024, the Houthis attacked over 100 commercial vessels using drones and missiles, sinking two ships and killing four sailors. Their campaign has severely disrupted Red Sea shipping , which normally sees about $1 trillion in goods pass through annually with 12 percent of global shipping traffic normally passesThe US military has released little information about the strikes, and the Houthis tightly control access to affected areas, making it difficult to verify the full impact. Many of the strikes are believed to have hit military and security targets.According to Houthi media, recent US airstrikes also hit Kamaran Island, Marib governorate, and the Attan area of Sanaa, under rebel control since 2014. A sanitation facility in Asir and a busy market in Shoub were among the locations struck.Since March, over 200 people have reportedly been killed in US airstrikes. The US claims the offensive aims to halt Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping lanes.The Houthis temporarily paused their attacks during a two-month ceasefire in Gaza but resumed them after Israel restarted its military operations. Known formally as Ansar Allah, the Houthis emerged in the 1990s and gained power in 2014 when they took control of Sanaa and forced President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to flee the country.","The attacks reportedly hit a market in the Furwah neighborhood of the Shuub district.

According to Superintendent Richard Sullivan, the gunfire appeared to target a specific individual, though no injuries were reported. The suspect fled the scene before officers arrived.Eyewitnesses described the terrifying moment the shots rang out beneath one of the city's busiest university hubs. ""Everyone's kind of convinced it's firecrackers,"" one commuter told CBS Boston. ""And the train stops. The conductor's like, 'Guys, hold tight real quick.' He comes through, he doesn't know what's happening.""Another eyewitness shared the chilling uncertainty of the moment, saying, ""I mean, it was kind of a horrifying experience. But I guess that is just more or less life now. Like, you gotta be, I guess, ready for that sort of stuff to happen anywhere at any time.""In the immediate aftermath, the university sent out an emergency message urging those on or near campus to take shelter indoors as police combed the area for the shooter. Authorities shut down part of the Red Line service and rerouted passengers via shuttle buses while they conducted their search.By late Sunday afternoon, Harvard lifted the shelter-in-place alert and removed the advisory from its website. Despite the clear danger posed by the gunman’s actions, no injuries were confirmed and police continued their investigation into the identity and motive of the suspect.The incident has raised concerns once again about public safety and gun violence in everyday settings.
