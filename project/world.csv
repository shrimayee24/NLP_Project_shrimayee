PUNE: A 25-year-old BPO worker, Shubhada Kodare, was hacked to death with a cleaver by a colleague in the parking lot of her office, while two dozen people remained mute spectators.Shubhada was attacked by 27-year-old Krishna Satyanarayan Kanojia on Tuesday, allegedly because she refused to return money borrowed from him on false pretext. She succumbed to injuries late Tuesday at a private hospital. Kanojia was arrested and investigation is on.A grainy minute-long video of the attack surfaced online Thursday, which showed the attacker calmly walking about with the cleaver before Shubhada slumped to the ground and a pool of blood formed around her. While 20-odd people witnessed the scene unfold on premises of the BPO where both the accused and the victim worked, none moved to stop the attacker. Some grabbed the assailant only after he tossed away the cleaver.Additional commissioner of police Manoj Patil said probe revealed that both Shubhada and Kanojia were working as executives in the accounts department of the BPO at Ramwadi in Yerawada. About a year ago, Shubhada, of Karad in Satara, told Kanojia that she needed money to support treatment of her father. He lent her money several times adding up to Rs 4 lakh.A few months ago, she informed Kanojia that her father would be operated upon. After a few days, Kanojia, as a good gesture, visited her father. He was shocked to learn that her father did not have any health issues.After this, Kanojia demanded his money back, but she picked arguments and lodged a non-cognisable offence against him three months ago, Patil said. He kept pursuing her to get his money back, but she avoided him and did not answer his calls.""Enraged, Kanojia came prepared and attacked her,"" he said.","Shubhada Kodare, 25, was hacked to death with a cleaver by a colleague in the parking lot of her office.

Hiding sister’s inter-caste marriage is cruelty: Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hiding-sisters-inter-caste-marriage-is-cruelty-court/articleshow/117100514.cms,"The wife left her marital home two days after learning that her sister-in-law had married into another community which she considered lower in the societal caste hierarchy.

AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court has served notice to a woman who obtained a divorce through a family court primarily citing cruelty because her husband's sister had married outside their caste and this information was hidden from her. The couple's arranged marriage took place in 2018, as stated by the husband's representative.The wife left her marital home two days after learning that her sister-in-law had married into another community which she considered lower in the societal caste hierarchy. In 2020, the woman filed for divorce in Bhavnagar family court, claiming cruelty. She said her husband had concealed information about his sister's inter-caste marriage .While he did mention having two sisters, he failed to disclose a third sister who had married outside their caste.She met this third sister only during the wedding. Additionally, she said her husband filed a police complaint alleging threats to his life from her family and mailed it to her workplace.The husband filed a suit requesting restoration of conjugal rights, seeking court intervention to compel his wife to return.On September 30, 2024 the Bhavnagar family court dismissed his petition while granting the wife's divorce request. The husband contested this decision through two separate appeals and requested HC to quash the divorce order. After a preliminary hearing, Justices Biren Vaishnav and DM Desai stated that perusal of the judgment and decree under challenge would indicate that one of the primary grounds on which the application of the wife was entertained, claiming that the appellant husband had committed cruelty, is that one of the sisters of the appellant was married to someone from another community.Following the notice issued to the woman, the high court has scheduled a joint hearing of both appeals on January 20.","The couple's arranged marriage took place in 2018, as stated by the husband's representative.

RAIPUR: A silo of a smelting plant collapsed in Chhattisgarh's Mungeli district on Thursday, killing one worker, injuring another and trapping at least four to five others. Rescuers fear the toll may rise.Actual numbers are hard to get as the concrete and metal debris was extremely hot, and rescuers hadn't been able to access the site properly till 8.30pm. ""The ash inside the silo is a searing 112 degrees Celsius. We are trying to empty it so that the structure can be removed to check what lies under it. Cranes and other heavy equipment have been deployed to speed up the operation,"" Bilaspur range IG Sanjeev Shukla told TOI.""According to the factory management, a supervisor and another labourer haven't been seen since the incident occurred. It's feared they are trapped under the debris,"" the IG added. The mishap took place at a private smelting plant near Rambod and Saragaon villages, some 60km from Mungeli district headquarters and 100km from Raipur. The plant is undergoing expansion, and it's not yet known if the silo was a recent addition.Mungeli SP Bhojram Patel, who was on the spot, told TOI: ""The silo was an iron structure used to store huge quantities of hot ash. It suddenly came crashing down, trapping at least 4-5 persons.""Two labourers were pulled out and admitted to a hospital in Bilaspur, 35km away. ""One of them died and the other is in a critical condition,"" IG Shukla said.""The debris is being removed to find out if more people are trapped, but its sheer weight, over 70 tonnes, and the hot ash are proving challenging. It will take some time to cool down. The rescue will likely continue through the night,"" the SP added.","A silo of a smelting plant collapsed in Chhattisgarh's Mungeli district on Thursday, killing one worker.

"Gauhati HC ruling on 'foreigners' puts 25,000 in Assam under deportation threat",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gauhati-hc-ruling-on-foreigners-puts-25000-in-assam-under-deportation-threat/articleshow/117097416.cms,"The court's decision stems from an appeal of one Begum Zan, who sought an extension for registering with FRRO.

GUWAHATI: Around 25,000 Bangladeshi immigrants in Assam may face deportation following a ruling by Gauhati high court Thursday. The case pertains to immigrants who arrived between 1966 and 1971 but failed to register with Foreigners Regional Registration Officer (FRRO) after being declared foreigners by tribunals.The court's decision stems from an appeal of one Begum Zan, who sought an extension for registering with FRRO. She was declared a foreigner by the Barpeta foreigners' tribunal on June 29, 2020, but she failed to meet the registration deadline. The court rejected her plea, citing the binding nature of a recent Supreme Court ruling.The case brings to the forefront a long-standing issue in Assam, where the 1955 Citizenship Act's Section 6A, introduced in 1985, specifically addresses the status of immigrants from Bangladesh. Section 6A(2) grants citizenship to those who entered Assam before Jan 1, 1966, while Section 6A(3) covers those who entered between Jan 1, 1966, and March 25, 1971. The latter group is required to register with FRRO within 30 days of being declared foreigners, with a possible extension to 60 days. Those who fail to do so face the risk of deportation, while those who register are granted rights similar to citizenship, excluding electoral participation for ten years. After this period, they become full citizens.About 5,000 people who missed the registration deadline, along with their family members, bring the total number facing deportation to Bangladesh to nearly 25,000. The high court judges said they could not grant an extension in Zan's case, emphasising they were ""bound by the decision of the Supreme Court"". The decision referred to a ruling made in Oct 2024 by a five-member constitution bench, which upheld the legality of Section 6A of Citizenship Act.The majority of judges in the SC bench held that immigrants in this group (1966 to 1971), who did not register within the prescribed timeframe, would lose eligibility for citizenship. Justice JB Pardiwala dissented, arguing that those immigrants should be allowed to register even after the deadline.Zan's counsel AS Tapadar argued that the minority opinion from Justice Pardiwala should prevail. ""Time should be allowed for the petitioner to register with FRRO,"" Tapadar urged.","Around 25,000 Bangladeshi immigrants in Assam may face deportation.

KOLKATA: A trial court is set to deliver the RG Kar Medical College and Hospital rape-murder verdict on January 18, more than five months after a 31-year-old junior doctor was violated and brutally killed in the state government-run institute, setting off a wave of protests in Kolkata, ripples of which were felt around the country. CBI , which is investigating the matter, demanded death for Sanjay Roy , the primary accused, in its closing arguments on Thursday at the Sealdah sessions court, citing multiple reports: biological samples, CCTV footage analysis, testimonies of 50 witnesses - which, it said, proved he was the sole perpetrator of the 'monstrous crime'. The Central agency's lawyers also said that the rape-murder was a 'rarest of rare' crime, fit for capital punishment.Roy has been implicated under 103(1), 64, and 66 of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), which deal with murder, rape and for causing death or leaving the victim in a persistent vegetative state. If convicted, Roy will either be sentenced to death or face a life behind bars.Defence lawyer Sourav Bandyopadhyay, chief of the Legal Aid Defence Council Service, South 24 Parganas, said in his final submission that his client was innocent, and that he was being framed by evidence planted against him.","A trial court is set to deliver the RG Kar Medical College and Hospital rape- murder verdict on January 18.

KOCHI: In a significant judgment, Kerala HC Thursday ruled that permission for organ donation cannot be denied unless there is cogent evidence establishing a commercial element. A donor's assertion that donation is made out of altruism should be accepted in absence of credible evidence to the contrary, HC said.Justice C S Dias gave the ruling on a plea by a 20-year-old renal failure patient and his voluntary donor, challenging decision of an authorisation committee denying permission for kidney transplant .Initially, the application was rejected by health officials citing absence of a certificate of altruism from the district police chief. Despite an HC directive to consider the application without insisting on the police certificate, both authorisation committee and principal secretary of health dept rejected it again. The committee denied the application once more despite producing the said certificate, prompting the petitioners to move HC again.While hearing the petition, the bench referenced a prior decision, wherein it was observed that voluntary donation of an organ represents self-deprivation of the highest order, and it is inhuman to presume that such a sacrifice is made solely for monetary considerations. HC directed the authorisation committee to grant permission for the transplant within a week.","Kerala HC ruled that permission for organ donation cannot be denied unless there is cogent evidence establishing a commercial element.

Nephew tipped off cops about man living a double life

VARANASI: From most wanted to most trusted, Nakdu Yadav pulled off the ultimate con, living as a lawbreaker while working for the law, blending into the very system that once pursued him.A gangster with a rap sheet as long as a dusty Azamgarh road, Nakdu pulled a Houdini act by rebranding himself as Nandlal Yadav. For 35 years, he worked as a home guard in UP, hiding in plain sight - right under police's nose.Now, at 57 and nearing retirement, Nakdu's double life has come to a dramatic end.He was involved in multiple crimes between 1984 and '89, and charged under the Gangsters Act. He disappeared from the radar for a few months before re-emerging, with a forged identity and fake documents, as a home guard.Nakdu Yadav ’s education — a school dropout after Class 4 — didn’t deter him. With a forged Class 8 certificate, he transformed into Nandlal, son of Lokai Yadav, and secured the job with a clean slate.It wasn’t until October 2024 that his well-guarded secret began to crumble. The first cracks in his elaborate facade appeared from a ‘betrayal’ within his own family. His nephew, also named Nandlal, tipped off police following an altercation with a neighbour, revealing that his uncle had been living a double life.This revelation led Azamgarh’s DIG Vaibhav Krishna to order a thorough investigation, and the truth began to unravel.Nakdu’s arrest in Oct and subsequent complaint from his relatives opened Pandora’s box, leading to his suspension and the initiation of proceedings for his dismissal from home guards.“The investigation would dig deep into how Nakdu managed to evade capture for so long and whether there was any institutional failure,” Azamgarh SP Hemraj Meena said Thursday.Nakdu’s crimes were far from minor. In 1984, he shot dead a man over a bitter rivalry. The following years saw him embroiled in robbery and other serious charges.Even more shocking, officers at Rani ki Sarai police station and intelligence officers vouched for his character, signing off on his forged documents. The officers are now under scrutiny, their alleged complicity or negligence under investigation.","Nakdu Yadav was a gangster with a rap sheet as long as a dusty Azamgarh road.

Kamala Harris’ death stare at Obama and Trump’s chat: Is she jealous or just fed up?

The unspoken rivalries: Harris, Obama, and Trump

What does Michelle Obama think?

The unexpected camaraderie between former President Barack Obama and President-elect Donald Trump at Jimmy Carter’s state funeral has taken social media by storm, raising eyebrows, sparking debates, and fueling speculation about Vice President Kamala Harris ' reaction to their exchange.At the ceremony, Obama and Trump were spotted seated next to each other, chatting and sharing light-hearted moments. This scene was a stark contrast to the political animosity that has marked much of their public interaction. As the two men seemed to bond, eyes were drawn to Kamala Harris, who was seated just in front of them. Some social media users were quick to point out her subtle, yet noticeable, reactions as she glanced back at the pair.""Kamala Harris gets pissy when she looks back and sees Obama pleasantly chatting with Trump at Carter’s funeral,"" one user commented on X (formerly Twitter). Another remarked, ""Kamala’s face when Obama speaks to Trump! If looks could kill!"" The reactions grew as people speculated that Harris, who had an intense primary battle against Trump in 2020, might have been feeling some kind of envy or frustration.One user even went so far as to say, ""Kamala takes a peep at Trump and Obama having a chat at Jimmy Carter’s Funeral and gives immediate sista girl sigh,"" while another added, ""Obama and Trump looking like besties meanwhile Kamala looks like the jealous ex."" Were these facial expressions a reflection of unspoken political tensions or just the natural reaction of someone caught in a complex moment?While the internet buzzed about Harris' body language, there was another curious absence at the funeral: Michelle Obama. Despite her husband being present, former First Lady Michelle Obama was notably missing from the gathering. CNN’s Jeff Zeleny reported that Michelle Obama had “scheduling conflicts” and was still in Hawaii. This left many wondering if her absence was purely logistical or if there was something more to it, given the complex dynamics at play between the Obamas and the Trumps.As for Barack Obama, he gave a heartfelt tribute to Carter, acknowledging his legacy of grace, dignity, justice, and service. In his tribute, Obama reflected on Carter’s words: “We can choose to alleviate suffering. We can choose to work together for peace.” These words resonate as the world watches the evolving relationships between America’s political figures.Kamala Harris, who has made history as the first female Vice President and the highest-ranking woman in U.S. political history, has always had a complicated relationship with both Barack Obama and Donald Trump. While Obama championed her run for Vice President and has spoken highly of her leadership, their relationship isn't without its complexities, especially after her rocky 2020 presidential campaign, which saw sharp exchanges with Joe Biden, now her political partner. Trump, on the other hand, remains a deeply polarizing figure, and Harris’ role in the Biden administration has naturally placed her in opposition to his influence.The funeral incident only adds fuel to the fire of speculation around the power dynamics between these key political players. Could there be underlying tensions that we haven’t seen publicly? Or was this merely a fleeting moment captured by cameras that has been overanalyzed by the public eye?As Michelle Obama remains out of the spotlight at the funeral, many are left wondering if her absence was more than just scheduling. Known for her powerful and charismatic presence, the former First Lady has maintained a relatively low profile since leaving the White House. Her absence during such a high-profile event only adds to the intrigue surrounding the moment.But with Barack Obama and Donald Trump seemingly enjoying each other's company, and Kamala Harris’ response garnering attention, it's clear that the dynamics between these political giants are far from simple. Is Kamala Harris truly jealous of their bond, or is it just a moment of frustration in the face of her own political journey?For now, the internet remains divided. The quiet reactions, body language, and what’s left unsaid continue to keep political observers on edge, eagerly awaiting the next chapter in the ever-complicated world of American politics.","As the two men seemed to bond, eyes were drawn to Kamala Harris, who was seated just in front of them.

He continued, claiming that such a merger would eliminate tariffs, lower taxes, and ensure Canada’s security against threats from Russia and China. ""Together, what a great nation it would be!!!""This is not the first time Trump has floated the idea of Canada becoming part of the US. During a meeting at his Mar-a-Lago resort with Trudeau, Trump suggested that if Canada's economy were to collapse under US tariffs, it could merge with the US with Trudeau as its ""governor."" Trudeau reportedly responded that such tariffs would harm Canada’s economy.Trump’s comments also revisited his previous suggestions about Canada’s political future, including a December post joking that hockey legend Wayne Gretzky could run for Prime Minister—or even serve as Canada's ""governor."" Trump has long criticized Canada's trade practices, particularly its trade deficit with the U.S. and the country’s handling of migrant issues.The resignation of Trudeau, who has faced months of slumping poll numbers and internal party division, marks the end of his tenure after nearly a decade in power. Trudeau announced he would step down once the Liberal Party selects a new leader, leaving him as a caretaker prime minister until then.While Trump’s suggestion may seem tongue-in-cheek, it reflects a more serious underlying criticism of Canada’s economic policies and the strain in US-Canada relations. Trump had previously threatened a 25% tariff on all Canadian and Mexican imports if they did not take stronger action to curb migration and prevent fentanyl from entering the US. His comments on Trudeau's resignation seem to underline his belief that Canada's economic and political troubles may leave it vulnerable to deeper integration with the US.","US President-elect Donald Trump responded to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's resignation.

BREAKING: President-Elect Trump And Melania Visit Capitol Rotunda Where Jimmy Carter Lies In State

A funeral steeped in fashion, tension, and political drama

Melania Trump has made her return to Washington DC, but it wasn’t just her presence at the funeral of former president Jimmy Carter that caught attention—her outfit became the talk of the town.The 54-year-old former First Lady , joined by her husband, President-elect Donald Trump , was seen attending the National Cathedral service Thursday morning. As the couple sat in the front row, all eyes weren’t just on the ceremonial proceedings, but on Melania’s striking outfit.The ex-beauty queen chose a long-sleeve Valentino black coat dress with an oversized white collar, paired with a dramatic print of a 19th-century neoclassical sculpture of lovers sharing an intimate kiss. While the dress itself was a statement, it quickly became the center of heated discussions on social media.Some took to X (formerly Twitter) to share their harsh opinions. “WTF is Melania wearing? Did the nun store have a sale?” one person posted, comparing her to a “nun.” Another mocked the ensemble, calling it a “pilgrim outfit,” referencing the dress’s exaggerated collar. The critiques only escalated, with one user adding, “Looks like our next four years of ‘What the f--- is Melania wearing?’ starts today.”But the fashion criticisms didn’t end with the former First Lady’s attire. Her reappearance also saw her catch the eye of former Vice President Mike Pence’s wife, Karen Pence, who appeared to avoid any interaction with either Donald or Melania. Mike Pence, however, shook hands with both, despite his recent vocal criticism of Trump in his memoir, So Help Me God.Not just Melania, but the entire event became a spectacle of political tension. As President-elect Trump and Barack Obama were seen chatting amicably, viewers couldn’t help but wonder what was being discussed behind the scenes. But it was Melania’s fashion choice and the stark dynamics between former political allies that kept the audience intrigued.In a moment of unusual tension, Kamala Harris—seated just in front of the Trumps—arrived and deliberately avoided making eye contact with Donald Trump. “Kamala arrived, Trump kept staring at her, she wouldn’t look at him,” one social media user noted.For Trump, the funeral was a chance to pay his respects to Carter, but his usual political posturing continued. Just days before the service, he had taken a swipe at the late president's controversial decision to relinquish control of the Panama Canal to Panama. “Jimmy Carter gave it to them for $1, and they were supposed to treat us well,” Trump had said in a news conference. ""It was the most expensive structure ever built in the history of our country.""While the day was meant to honor a former president, it became a moment filled with political undercurrents and fashion-focused commentary. Melania Trump, typically known for her sharp style, once again found herself at the center of a cultural conversation—this time not for a diplomatic or fashion-forward choice, but for a polarizing outfit that turned heads for all the wrong reasons.",Melania Trump's outfit at Jimmy Carter's funeral became the talk of the town.

Desperation in the flames

Royal refuge under threat

The air in Southern California crackled with tension as ferocious wildfires, fueled by hurricane-strength winds, ripped through neighborhoods once synonymous with serenity and luxury. Among those in peril: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle , whose $29 million Montecito mansion now teeters on the edge of disaster, reported the New York Post.Southern California Edison (SCE) issued grim warnings of potential "" Public Safety Power Shutoffs ,"" leaving the Duke and Duchess of Sussex anxiously awaiting news of their sprawling 18,000-square-foot haven, where they reside with their children, Prince Archie, 5, and Princess Lilibet, 3. The idyllic escape they built over four years ago is now engulfed in uncertainty.The chaos doesn't stop there. Vice President Kamala Harris, whose Los Angeles neighborhood fell under an evacuation order Wednesday night, narrowly avoided catastrophe. Her official residence, empty at the time, now stands as a silent witness to the inferno’s relentless march.The blaze closest to the Sussexes' home rages in Malibu, roughly 70 miles away — a seemingly safe distance, until winds exceeding 100 miles per hour began to hurl embers across highways and ignite new fronts. Nearly 70,000 Southern California Edison customers were without power Wednesday morning, with an additional 42,000 outages scheduled. Emergency responders were further hamstrung by bone-dry hydrants, turning an already impossible fight into a nightmare.The chaos on the ground is palpable. Tens of thousands have fled their homes, many abandoning vehicles as gridlocked traffic renders escape by car futile. Families, celebrities, and local residents alike have been forced to make the harrowing decision to leave everything behind, carrying only what they can hold as they flee on foot.As the threat inches closer to Montecito, Harry and Meghan may soon face evacuation orders . Their neighborhood, perched precariously in a ""high fire risk"" area, is no stranger to nature’s wrath. The couple's $14.65 million purchase in 2020 was met with admiration for its modern design and lavish amenities — but even such opulence offers little protection from the ferocity of nature.For now, Montecito holds its breath. Helicopters thunder overhead, dropping water on roaring flames, while families across the region grapple with a singular question: Will their home still stand when the smoke clears?With bone-dry conditions, chaotic evacuations, and the ever-present hum of uncertainty, the Sussexes — like so many others — face a terrifying reality: no title, fame, or fortune can shield them from the fires of California.","Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's $29 million Montecito mansion now teeters on the edge of disaster.

At least five people have lost their lives and over 1,000 structures have been reduced to ash as raging wildfires swept through the Los Angeles area, officials confirmed.The fires, fueled by powerful Santa Ana winds , have forced thousands to evacuate their homes and businesses, with many fleeing smoke-filled canyons and celebrity-filled neighborhoods. A state of emergency was declared by California governor Gavin Newsom as wildfires raged across Los Angeles.The towering blazes ignited on Tuesday and were driven by winds gusting up to 70 mph (112 kph) in certain areas, creating an inferno that firefighters struggled to contain. For a time, the winds rendered aerial firefighting efforts too dangerous. By Wednesday morning, however, firefighting aircraft resumed operations, dropping water and retardants over the flames.Governor Gavin Newsom reported that more than 1,400 firefighters have been deployed to combat the fires, with additional support coming from Oregon, which has dispatched 240 firefighters and 60 engines. The Los Angeles Fire Department issued an extraordinary call for all off-duty personnel to join the fight.Preliminary estimates by AccuWeather place the damage and economic losses from these fires between $52 billion and $57 billion. The destruction is concentrated in Pacific Palisades, where at least 1,000 structures have been decimated, making the Palisades Fire the most destructive in Los Angeles history. It surpasses the Sayre Fire of November 2008, which destroyed 604 structures in Sylmar.Social media has been flooded with heart-wrenching videos capturing the fire’s wrath. Harrowing footage shows flames consuming entire neighborhoods and forcing mass evacuations.Videos also document firefighting planes scooping water from the Pacific Ocean and releasing it over residential areas in a desperate effort to battle the infernos.The fire’s proximity to iconic landmarks, including the Hollywood Sign, has heightened public alarm, with some residents reporting flames visible from across Los Angeles.The devastation has prompted an outpouring of support, with neighboring states and local organizations stepping in to aid rescue operations.

A long road ahead

As apocalyptic wildfires tear through Southern California, the state finds itself engulfed in a deadly inferno. For a third relentless day, winds exceeding hurricane-force levels fan the flames of five monstrous blazes — the Palisades, Eaton, Hurst, Lidia, and Sunset fires — leaving devastation in their wake. More than 29,000 acres have already been scorched, and 2,93,000 residents are under evacuation orders, turning tranquil neighborhoods into smoldering wastelands.The death toll, now at five, is expected to rise, as the fires ravage homes, schools, and businesses. California Governor Gavin Newsom declared the situation a ""statewide catastrophe,"" estimating the economic toll at $52 billion, which could make this the costliest wildfire event in US history.“This is unlike anything we’ve ever seen. The ferocity of the winds, the dryness of the landscape, and the speed at which these fires are spreading — it’s overwhelming,” Newsom said while surveying the ruins of a school destroyed by the flames.The Palisades Fire alone has incinerated over 17,200 acres, leveling more than 1,000 structures. Entire neighborhoods, including parts of the celebrity-packed Pacific Palisades, now lie in ashes. Schools have not been spared either — the Los Angeles Unified School District confirmed that two elementary schools and a high school were destroyed, prompting officials to close all schools indefinitely and explore online learning.“The confluence of wind, fire, and smoke has created an unprecedented challenge,” district administrators said in a statement.Meanwhile, the Eaton Fire has claimed an additional 1,000 structures, marking it as one of the county’s most destructive blazes in history.Amid the chaos, water shortages have further hindered firefighting efforts. Residents in affected areas have been asked to boil water due to possible contamination, while reports of depleted water tanks have sparked outrage.“It’s shameful,” said one evacuee. “We’re paying sky-high taxes, and yet we don’t even have enough water to fight fires.”Hollywood’s elite have not been spared. Celebrities including Paris Hilton, Billy Crystal, and Anthony Hopkins lost their homes, while James Woods shared a heartbreaking image of his burning house on social media.“This tests your soul. Losing everything at once, I must say,” Woods wrote on X, blaming “liberal idiots like Gavin Newsom” for the state’s failure to manage the crisis.Actress Sarah Michelle Gellar slammed Los Angeles’ leadership on Instagram for failing to provide proper evacuation routes, saying, “City of LA, you want everyone to evacuate, yet you have complete gridlock and not one traffic cop on the roads helping.”Meanwhile, Sara Foster, daughter of music mogul David Foster, accused state leaders of prioritizing “fish over people,” referencing a controversial water policy.The wildfires have sparked a fierce political war, with Donald Trump launching scathing attacks on Newsom via Truth Social.“One of the best and most beautiful parts of the United States is burning to the ground. Gavin Newscum [sic] should resign. This is all his fault!” Trump wrote.The former president accused Newsom of favoring environmental policies over practical disaster management, saying, “He wanted to protect a worthless fish instead of providing water to fight fires. Now the ultimate price is being paid.”Newsom fired back, telling CNN, “This is not the time for politics. This is a time for action.”Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has also faced backlash, with critics labeling her “the most incompetent politician in America” after she botched a press conference, urging locals to visit “URL” for fire updates.Bass, who recently returned from a controversial trip to Ghana, has been slammed for cutting the fire department’s budget and failing to prepare the city for such a large-scale disaster.“This firestorm is the big one,” Bass admitted, but her vague and unprepared responses have drawn sharp criticism.“FIRE THIS DUMBASS NOW,” one user raged on X, while others accused her of “going all Joe Biden, not knowing what she’s saying.”As the fires rage on, looters have taken advantage of the chaos. Two arrests were made Wednesday, with Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna vowing to prosecute offenders.“It’s always sad when I have to say this,” Luna said. “But if you’re thinking of stealing from our community members already impacted by this disaster, you will be caught.”The situation remains dire, with over 10,300 homes at risk and firefighters battling dwindling resources.For now, California’s battle against nature’s wrath continues. As flames devour the land and political tempers flare, millions watch helplessly, wondering when — or if — the Golden State will ever recover.","California Governor Gavin Newsom declared the situation a ""statewide catastrophe,"" estimating the economic toll at $52 billion.

Mismanagement Leading to Devastating LA Wildfires, and if Trump Could Buy Greenland, w/ Fifth Column

Los Angeles is burning—literally and politically. As wildfires ravage the City of Angels, media personality Megyn Kelly unleashed a fiery tirade against LA Fire Chief Kristin Crowley and Mayor Karen Bass , accusing them of neglecting their fire-combating duties in favor of pushing diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.“In recent years, LA’s fire chief has made not filling the fire hydrants top priority, but diversity,” Kelly said on her show Wednesday. “Diversity is at least among the top priorities for the department.”Kelly referenced alarming reports from firefighters struggling to find working hydrants in the middle of the Pacific Palisades inferno. ""Who gives a s**t if the fire chief is gay? I’m sorry, but who gives a flying fig about who she likes to sleep with?” she raged. “Can you fight the f**king fires, madam? That’s the relevant question.”As the fires tore through the city, devastating 16,000 acres and over 1,000 structures in Pacific Palisades alone, Kelly didn’t hold back. “Can you fight fires? Can you make sure there’s water in the fire hydrants?” she demanded.Her scorn extended to Mayor Bass, who was in Ghana when the infernos erupted and returned Wednesday to dodge questions about her absence. ""This was foreseeable and what we are seeing: largely preventable,” Kelly said, highlighting the $17 million slashed from the LAFD budget in the last city plan.The situation on the ground is dire. Two other wildfires—the Eaton Fire and the Hurst Fire—are raging in Los Angeles County, with the Eaton Fire alone claiming five lives and burning over 10,000 acres. The Santa Ana winds , gusting up to 100 mph, have only fueled the destruction.“It is unbelievable what is happening in California right now. An American jewel of a city is in ashes,” Kelly said, lamenting the chaos. Her criticism turned political as she questioned whether California’s leadership could survive this disaster. “All over the world right now we are seeing people push back on these leftist politicians and the messes that they’ve created. Is this going to happen even in California after something as disastrous as this?”Crowley and Bass remain under fire for their handling of the disaster, with residents and critics alike demanding answers. As the flames continue to consume Los Angeles, Kelly’s fiery words are sparking debates just as intense as the wildfires themselves.","Megyn Kelly blasted LA Fire Chief Kristin Crowley and Mayor Karen Bass for putting diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives ahead of fire prevention.

Hostel room was illegally occupied by accused: SHO

PATNA: The Patna police recovered burned currency notes worth approximately Rs 2.75 lakh in Rs 100 and Rs 500 denominations, along with NEET and NEET-PG admit cards, from a hostel room at Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH) late Wednesday night.An MBBS OMR sheet of Aryabhatta Knowledge University and a liquor bottle were also found during the search of the ground-floor room of the hostel.PMCH principal Dr Vidyapati Choudhary filed an FIR at the Pirbahore police station on Thursday. Police said the occupant of the room, Dr Ajay Singh, a PG pass-out student, was absconding after the recovery of the burned notes and documents.The incident came to light a day after a fire broke out late Tuesday night in room 42B, occupied by Dr Singh, on the second floor of the Chanakya Hostel. Abdul Halim, SHO of Pirbahore police station, said, “Around 10pm on Wednesday, the police received information about burned notes and documents found in a ground-floor room of the hostel. The room was sealed. According to the hospital administration, the room was meant for the caretaker and staff but was illegally occupied by Dr Singh. It appears the documents and notes were burnt during fire and the accused later dumped them in the ground-floor room.”Earlier on Wednesday evening, another incident in- volving Dr Singh occurred. “At around 5.30pm, we recei- ved information that a doctor was assaulted by junior students and locked in a room. A police team visited the spot and found Dr Singh in room 625 on the sixth floor. He reported being beaten by juniors but refused to file a written complaint. He was let go after declining to press charges,” the SHO added.Hostel warden Dr Birendra confirmed the illegal occupation of rooms by Dr Singh. “The caretaker informed me about the fight in the hostel and the recovery of burned notes and documents on Wednesday. I asked them to report it to the police. Dr Singh, who completed his PG last year, hails from Samastipur,” he said.Dr Birendra added, “Singh had occupied 2-3 rooms, which I reported to the office. A notice to vacate was issued and pasted on his room, 42B. However, while we can issue notices, it is the administration’s responsibility to enforce evictions.”","Patna police recover Rs 2.75 lakh in burned notes and NEET admit cards from a PMCH hostel room.

A US federal appeals court on Thursday cleared the way for the release of part of special counsel Jack Smith's report on his investigation into President-elect Donald Trump 's alleged involvement in the 2020 election interference and the mishandling of classified records.The 11th circuit court of appeals rejected a request to block the release from Walt Nauta, a Trump associate, and Carlos de Oliveira, the former property manager at Mar-a-Lago. They face charges related to a separate investigation into Trump's handling of classified documents.The court upheld a judge's order delaying the release for three days to allow for appeals. This ruling allows Trump to ask the Supreme Court to block the report's release.The report concerns the alleged attempts by Trump and his allies to challenge the 2020 election results, as well as allegations regarding Trump's possession of classified documents at his Florida residence. Smith was appointed by attorney general Merrick Garland in 2022 to investigate the case. Both Trump and his aides, Nauta and de Oliveira, have pleaded not guilty to the charges against them. Nauta and de Oliveira pleaded not guilty to federal charges accusing them of conspiring to obstruct the FBI's investigation into classified documents discovered at Mar-a-Lago.Attorney general Merrick Garland previously expressed his intent to release the election interference portion of Smith's report if the court allowed it. A second volume of the report, focusing on the classified documents case, will not be released while cases against co-defendants are pending.Trump's spokesperson, Steven Cheung, responded by saying, “It is time for Joe Biden and Merrick Garland to do the right thing and put a final stop to the political weaponization of our Justice system.” He did not indicate whether Trump would appeal.Trump has often criticised Smith. In an October interview, Trump said he would ""fire him within two seconds"" if re-elected. Smith and his team reportedly plan to step down before Trump's January 20 inauguration.Separately, the Supreme Court cleared the way for Trump's sentencing in a New York hush money case on Friday.","A US federal appeals court on Thursday cleared the way for the release of part of special counsel Jack Smith's report on his investigation into President-elect Donald Trump.

I heard one fire captain say that it was like trying to stop the tornado. You can't do it. Also, any of the aircraft that usually dropped the fire retardant could not be deployed. So, it was really human beings fighting these fires, and they're powerless. It was pretty devastating,"" Shourie said.""I can't even take care of my friends. I would say 100 per cent of my friends in the neighbourhood have either lost or had damaged homes or had complete smoke, ash contamination,"" she added.Following his cancellation of visits to Italy and Vatican City, Outgoing President Joe Biden told reporters on Thursday, describing the situation in California as catastrophic, with numerous houses, schools, and businesses destroyed, communities obliterated, lives lost, and families permanently affected.""They're the worst fires to ever hit Los Angeles,"" he stated at the White House after consulting with senior officials.The current death toll stands at six, with thousands of buildings destroyed. Officials estimate over 360,000 people have been displaced.

US appeals court temporarily halts 9/11 mastermind’s plea deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-appeals-court-temporarily-halts-9/11-masterminds-plea-deal/articleshow/117102188.cms,"AP photo

The Biden administration succeeded Thursday in temporarily blocking a guilty plea by accused 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , stalling a plea deal that would spare him the risk of the death penalty for al-Qaida's Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.Administration lawyers had urged a federal appeals panel to block Mohammed's guilty plea from going forward as scheduled Friday at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba.Defence lawyers described the attempts to throw out the agreement as the latest in two decades of ""fitful"" and ""negligent"" mishandling of the case by the US military and successive administrations.The federal appeals panel agreed Thursday evening to a temporary stay. It stressed that the stay would hold only as long as it took to more fully consider arguments in the government's request, and should not be considered a final ruling.It stalls an attempt to wrap up more than two decades of military prosecution - beset by legal challenges - in one of the deadliest attacks in US history.Thursday's legal action marked a last-ditch government request to prevent Mohammed from entering a guilty plea Friday. Family members of some of the nearly 3,000 people killed in al-Qaida's Sept. 11, 2001, attacks already were gathered at the US naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to hear it.The fight has put the Biden administration at odds with the US military officials it had appointed to oversee justice in al-Qaida's attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, that killed nearly 3,000 people. It was the latest tumult and uncertainty in two decades of troubled prosecution tied to one of the deadliest attacks on American soil.Asked about the appeal Thursday after a meeting in Germany with allies about military support for Ukraine, Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters he had not changed his opposition to the deal and cited the court challenge in declining further comment.The deal, negotiated over two years and approved by military prosecutors and the Pentagon's senior official for Guantanamo in late July, would spare Mohammed and two co-defendants the risk of the death penalty. It also obligates them to answer any lingering questions that families of the victims have about the attacks.Defence attorneys say the plea agreements are already in effect and say Austin has no legal authority to throw them out after the fact.At Guantanamo, preparations have moved ahead for Friday's proceedings, and family members of some of the victims already have gathered. If the hearing goes forward, Mohammed would swear an oath in the military courtroom, and then defence attorney Gary Sowards would enter pleas on his behalf to 2,976 counts of murder, along with other charges.Pleas by co-defendants Walid bin Attash and Mustafa al Hawsawi would follow later this month. Attorneys say months of sentencing hearings to follow would give the government an opportunity to outline its case and allow families to speak of their loss.Legal and logistical challenges have bogged down the 9/11 case in the 17 years since charges were filed against Mohammed, who prosecutors say conceived the idea of using hijacked planes in the attacks. The case remains in pretrial hearings, with no trial date set.Years of defence and prosecution testimony have dragged on about how much the torture of Mohammed and other defendants in CIA custody renders their later statements unusable in court.With that in mind, military prosecutors notified families of the victims this summer that the senior Pentagon official overseeing Guantanamo had approved a plea deal. They called it ""the best path to finality and justice.""Austin unexpectedly announced on August 2 that he was scrapping the agreement. He argued that a decision on death penalties in an attack as grave as September 11 should only be made by the defence secretary.The Biden administration went to the District of Columbia federal appeals court this week after the Guantanamo judge and a military review panel rejected Austin's intervention.Mohammed's attorneys argued that Austin's ""extraordinary intervention in this case is solely a product of his lack of oversight over his own duly appointed delegate,"" meaning the senior Pentagon official overseeing Guantanamo.The Justice Department said the government would be irreparably harmed if the guilty pleas were accepted.It said the government would be denied a chance for a public trial and the opportunity to ""seek capital punishment against three men charged with a heinous act of mass murder that caused the death of thousands of people and shocked the nation and the world.""","Administration lawyers had urged a federal appeals panel to block Mohammed's guilty plea from going forward.

WASHINGTON: It is the world's most exclusive society and meetings are limited to infrequent state occasions, but the so-called American Presidents Club was in session Thursday to see off departed comrade Jimmy Carter.The five living men who have occupied the White House - Joe Biden and his predecessors Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump - came together at Washington's National Cathedral for their first encounter since the 2018 funeral of another ex-president, George HW Bush. The political establishment turned out in force for Thursday's ceremony, with former vice-presidents Mike Pence, Al Gore and Dan Quayle chatting amiably as the elite leaders group was seated nearby.It might have been an awkward affair, as Trump has denigrated most of the group in disputes of varying degrees of seriousness - and found himself sitting next to longtime sparring partner Obama. Trump launched his political career by pushing racist and false ""birther"" conspiracy theory that his Democratic predecessor - the only black president - was lying about being a natural-born American. But the pair appeared able to put differences on hold as they were seen exchanging cordial small talk, with Obama smiling and laughing.It was also the first time since the election that Trump had been in the same room as his opponent Kamala Harris - whom he repeatedly accused of being mentally ill - and his first time in four years in close proximity to his estranged vice-president Pence. Pence refused to endorse his former boss in the 2024 election after a mob that Trump sent marching on the Capitol to halt the certification of the 2020 polls stormed the building chanting, ""Hang Mike Pence!""Biden, who gave the eulogy, sat with first lady Jill Biden beside vice-president Harris and Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff. Clinton and his wife Hillary Clinton - whom Trump defeated in 2016 to claim his first term - took their places next to Bush and his wife Laura.Carter, who died on Dec 29, be buried in Georgia next to his wife, Rosalynn.","The five living men who have occupied the White House came together at Washington's National Cathedral for the funeral of Jimmy Carter.

US Supreme Court on Thursday rejected President-elect Donald Trump's urgent request to delay sentencing in his hush money case. In a brief, unsigned order, the court ruled 5-4 that the ""burden that sentencing will impose on the President-Elect's responsibilities is relatively insubstantial"" and confirmed that Trump would be permitted to attend the proceedings virtually.The court further acknowledged that the presiding judge has indicated plans for an ""unconditional discharge"" sentence, which excludes imprisonment, financial penalties, or supervision.Trump is due to receive his sentence in Manhattan at 9.30 am (1430 GMT) on Friday, following his May conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records regarding a payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels, according to news agency AFP.Trump, who takes office on January 20, submitted an urgent application to the Supreme Court on Wednesday requesting a delay in sentencing.The court, which includes three justices appointed by Trump, denied his emergency application to block sentencing in a closely split decision.Four conservative justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh supported Trump's postponement request. However, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett, both conservatives, joined the court's three liberal justices in rejecting the president-elect’s bid.Barrett, along with Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, were appointed to the Supreme Court by Trump.The 78-year-old president-elect's legal team attempted various strategies to prevent sentencing, contending it would constitute a ""grave injustice"" and negatively impact presidential operations and governmental functions. They also sought to extend presidential immunity to the president-elect status.Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg countered these claims on Thursday, emphasising that Trump was a private citizen when ""charged, tried, and convicted."" Bragg maintained that the Supreme Court lacks authority over state court criminal proceedings.The top court's order confirmed Trump's right to appeal through New York state courts. Judge Juan Merchan previously indicated his intention to grant an unconditional discharge and approved Trump's virtual attendance at Friday's Manhattan sentencing.This conviction marks Trump as the first former US president with a criminal record and the first convicted felon to serve as president.

US House of Representatives passed a bill on Thursday aimed at imposing sanctions on the International Criminal Court (ICC). This comes in response to the court's arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant, reported Al Jazeera.The legislation called the ""Illegitimate Court Counteraction Act,"" received overwhelming support, passing 243 to 140.The bill seeks to penalise anyone aiding the ICC in investigating, arresting, or prosecuting US citizens or citizens of allied nations that reject the court’s jurisdiction. Sanctions include freezing assets and denying visas to those involved.Representative Brian Mast, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, defended the legislation, describing the ICC as a “kangaroo court” unfairly targeting Israel, a key US ally, according to Al Jazeera.The ICC’s arrest warrants, issued in May 2023, accuse Netanyahu and Gallant of war crimes during the Gaza conflict, which has resulted in significant casualties. While Israel is not a member of the ICC, the court claims jurisdiction over crimes committed within Palestine, a member since 2015.Human rights groups criticised the bill, arguing it undermines global justice efforts and weakens the ICC’s independence.The legislation is expected to pass quickly through the Republican-controlled Senate, potentially allowing President-elect Donald Trump to sign it into law.In 2020, Trump imposed sanctions on ICC officials over similar investigations into US and Israeli activities, which President Joe Biden later reversed.The ICC, based in The Hague, continues to investigate war crimes worldwide, including allegations against Russian President Vladimir Putin over Ukraine.","US House of Representatives passed a bill on Thursday aimed at imposing sanctions on the International Criminal Court (ICC) This comes in response to the court's arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant.

In an unexpected moment of camaraderie, former President Donald Trump and President Barack Obama were seen sharing an unusually lengthy and lively conversation at the funeral of former President Jimmy Carter on January 9, 2025. The two, known for their political differences, seemed at ease as they laughed and chatted before the service at Washington National Cathedral, drawing attention from fellow attendees and cameras.The funeral marked an extraordinary occasion with all five living US presidents making a rare joint appearance. Sitting together for the first time since 2018, Donald Trump, Joe Biden, Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton shared a somber moment as they honored the late Jimmy Carter, who passed away on December 29, 2024, at the age of 100.While Biden, Bush, and Clinton were observed quietly reflecting, the attention turned to the friendly exchange between Trump and Obama. As the two men conversed, Trump was seen cracking jokes, his usual bravado softened in the presence of the somber event. Obama, often the subject of Trump’s criticism, appeared to engage warmly, even cracking a smile at times.Notably, Michelle Obama’s absence from the funeral caught the eye of many, as she was not seen in the crowd. Meanwhile, the Clintons—Hillary and Bill—made their entrance without acknowledging either Obama or Trump, their body language speaking volumes in contrast to the brief camaraderie between the two former presidents.Kamala Harris, who was present, turned her head to observe the interaction between Trump and Obama. She appeared to be paying attention to the unusual dynamic, but did not engage with either of them.The funeral, which took place at the Washington National Cathedral, was part of a National Day of Mourning declared by President Joe Biden to honor the legacy of Jimmy Carter . The former president, who served from 1977 to 1981, left behind a profound legacy in both US politics and humanitarian efforts. The funeral was attended by dignitaries, family members, and figures such as Hunter Biden, recently pardoned, who also made an appearance to pay his respects.As the ceremony unfolded, it was clear that despite years of political divides, the funeral of one of America’s most respected former leaders had temporarily united the nation’s top political figures in a rare moment of reflection and, perhaps, reconciliation.","Donald Trump and President Barack Obama were seen sharing an unusually lengthy and lively conversation at the funeral of former President Jimmy Carter on January 9, 2025.

Trudeau responds to Trump needling him about annexing Canada

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday responded to Donald Trump 's suggestion of annexing Canada and said that the United States President-elect's comments are a distraction from the potential impact of proposed tariffs on Canadian goods.Trump threatened 25% tariffs on all Canadian imports unless Canada increases border security. He also mentioned considering economic force to acquire Canada.In an interview to CNN, Trudeau responded to Trump's comments on 'Canada as 51st state of US' and said, ""Ya that is not going to happen. Canadians are incredibly proud of being Canadians. One of the ways we define ourselves most easily is, well, we're not American. There is such a depth of pride that that is not actually an issue.""""What I think is happening in this is President Trump, who is a very skillful negotiator, is getting people to be somewhat distracted by that conversation on tariffs,"" he added.Trudeau explained that American consumers would face higher prices on various Canadian products, including oil, gas, electricity, steel, aluminum, lumber, and concrete, if the tariffs are implemented.Trudeau reaffirmed Canada's opposition to joining the US and said Canada would retaliate with counter-tariffs if necessary. He cited a 2018 trade dispute where Canada placed tariffs on US products like Heinz ketchup, playing cards, bourbon, and Harley Davidson motorcycles.Did the re-election of Trump and this direct confrontation play any role at all in Trudeau resigning?""No, on the contrary, what we did in Trump's first Presidency was that we worked together in very challenging situations to come out with a strong win-win in US-Canada relations . We saw opportunities grow, wealth growWorking together is what we did something in the past and what I expect to do for the next two months while I remain in office,"" responded Trudeau.He explained such tariffs ""hurt American workers and added ""but we don't want to do that because it drives up prices for Canadians and it harms our closest trading partner.""","Donald Trump threatened 25% tariffs on all Canadian imports unless Canada increases border security.

Investigations into X underway

A former EU commissioner has accused Elon Musk of “lying like hell” over allegations that the European Union tried to prevent his online conversations with controversial political figures, including Alice Weidel , co-leader of Germany’s far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD).Thierry Breton, who stepped down as a European commissioner in September after spearheading regulations to rein in big tech, hit back at Musk’s claims in an interview with The Guardian. Breton rejected the assertion that the EU had interfered, labeling Musk’s statements as disingenuous.Musk, who owns X (formerly Twitter), alleged on Wednesday: ""First, the EU tried to stop me from having an online conversation with president @realDonaldTrump. Now they want to prevent people from hearing a conversation with Alice Weidel, who might be the next chancellor of Germany. These guys really hate democracy.”His comments referenced letters Breton had sent ahead of Musk’s high-profile interviews with Donald Trump in August and Alice Weidel on Thursday. Breton’s communications cited the Digital Services Act (DSA), which prohibits the amplification of harmful content, but he stressed they were reminders of legal obligations rather than censorship attempts. reported the Guardian.“Nobody tried to stop him,” Breton said. “We are twisting information [here]. He is lying like hell.”Breton maintained that the DSA protects free speech but enforces legal frameworks banning antisemitic, racist, and hateful content in both physical and digital spaces. “In Europe, freedom of speech is paramount... but it operates within a framework of laws,” he said, as quoted by the Guardian.Musk and Breton’s relationship has been marked by hostility. Recently, Musk dismissed Breton as “annoying” and invoked a crude line from the satirical film Tropic Thunder in response to his warnings.The confrontation is the latest in a series of public spats involving Musk, who has also taken aim at British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, drawing criticism across Europe.X is currently under investigation by the European Commission for potential violations of the DSA. While Musk’s platform has stated it is cooperating, insiders suggest adjudication on the matter could be published soon.Breton declined to comment on the investigation but emphasized that Europe’s digital regulations aim to balance freedom of expression with the prevention of harmful content. “With great power comes great responsibility,” he concluded.","Thierry Breton, who stepped down as a European commissioner in September after spearheading regulations to rein in big tech, hit back at Musk's claims.

As Donald Trump ramps up his rhetoric ahead of his inauguration , his suggestion to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the ""Gulf of America"" has sparked both support and outrage. The president-elect's plan, which he proposed during a Tuesday press conference, was met with immediate backlash from Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer .Schumer, never one to shy away from a fight, took to the Senate floor on Thursday to fire back at Trump’s proposal. “I’m fine with Trump wanting something more ‘patriotic,’” Schumer said, his voice tinged with sarcasm. “But only if he first agrees to work with us on an actual plan to lower costs for Americans.”The remark was a clear shot at the president-elect’s priorities, which Schumer and many Democrats argue are dangerously out of touch with the everyday concerns of the American people. “That is what the American people want us to focus on first, not on renaming bodies of water,” Schumer continued. “Our priorities are so much more closely aligned with the concerns of the American people than Donald Trump’s seem to be.”Trump’s comment, made amid a series of provocative geopolitical ideas including annexing Canada, acquiring Greenland, and retaking the Panama Canal, has generated controversy across the political spectrum. While his loyalists have voiced support for the bold, expansionist vision, critics, including Schumer and other top Democrats, argue that such ideas are distractions from more pressing issues.Schumer didn’t hold back, accusing Trump of trying to “distract America with crazy ideas,” arguing that renaming the Gulf of Mexico would do little to alleviate the financial burdens facing everyday Americans. “It’s not going to help people save money at the grocery store,” Schumer quipped.House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries echoed Schumer’s sentiments, calling out the president-elect’s fixation on geopolitical whims. “House Democrats believe that we are not sent to Washington to invade Greenland, rename the Gulf of Mexico, or seize the Panama Canal by force,” Jeffries said. Instead, he argued, Congress should be focused on “the issues that matter to the American people: Housing costs are too high, grocery costs are too high, insurance costs are too high, utility costs are too high.”","Donald Trump's proposal to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the ""Gulf of America"" has sparked both support and outrage.

Obama, Trump sit together, talk before Jimmy Carter funeral

Kamala Harris huffs after spotting Trump and Obama chatting good naturedly

Former President Barack Obama and President-elect Donald Trump were seen sharing smiles and laughter Thursday at the funeral of former President Jimmy Carter , but a professional lipreader has uncovered what might have been a much more serious conversation unfolding behind those grins.As the two giants of American politics sat side by side in the pews, the presence of cameras and the somber atmosphere seemed to mask what could have been a highly secretive and intense exchange. The two men, despite their frosty relationship over the years, were caught in an animated conversation that went far beyond pleasantries.According to forensic lipreader Jeremy Freeman, Trump, 78, subtly warned Obama, 63, that they would need to ""find a quiet place"" later to discuss something of “importance.”Freeman, who has served as a University College London-certified expert witness for over 16 years, as reported by the New York Post, translated Trump’s words as he leaned toward Obama, revealing, “I’ve pulled out of that. It’s the conditions. Can you imagine that?” Obama, chuckling, responded with a knowing laugh as Trump continued, “and after, I will,” before the TV cameras cut away.According to Freeman’s lipreading , the two appeared to be discussing international agreements . Could this have been a subtle reference to Trump’s well-known decisions to withdraw from Obama's landmark policies, such as the Iran nuclear deal or the Paris Climate Agreement ?As the conversation progressed, the two appeared to be plotting their next move. Trump said, “Call me at the foy after, yep,” seemingly referring to the National Cathedral’s foyer. Obama, nodding, responded with, “Can you just … it should be good.” Trump replied firmly, “I can’t talk, we have to find a quiet place sometime. This is a matter of importance, and we need to do this outside so that we can deal with it, certainly, today.”Given their tumultuous history—Trump has accused Obama of orchestrating the FBI’s alleged surveillance of his 2016 campaign, and Obama has mocked Trump repeatedly for his obsession with crowd sizes and even his business ventures—it’s no surprise that any conversation between them would be anything but ordinary.The intriguing whispers suggest that, despite their differences, the two men could be aligning on something important. Could it be related to Trump’s withdrawal from Obama’s international pacts? Or was this about something entirely new? The world may never know. But what we do know is that even in moments of quiet reflection, the stakes for Obama and Trump remain anything but peaceful.","The two men, despite their frosty relationship over the years, were caught in an animated conversation that went far beyond pleasantries. Trump, 78, subtly warned Obama, 63, that they would need to ""find a quiet place"" later to discuss something of ""importance""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117095210,imgsize-1210411,width-400,resizemode-4/117095210.jpg"
Reporter brutally grills Karen Bass over wildfire chaos — LA mayor's reaction goes viral,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-apologies-reporter-brutally-grills-karen-bass-over-wildfire-chaos-la-mayors-reaction-goes-viral/articleshow/117093359.cms,"Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass faced backlash for travelling to Ghana for a presidential inauguration while wildfires raged in her city. Confronted by a reporter upon her return, Bass refused to answer questions about her absence, budget cuts to the fire department, and whether she owed residents an apology.

A video capturing a tense moment between Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and Sky News journalist David Blevins has gone viral, offering a chilling glimpse into the mayor’s response—or lack thereof—during one of the city’s most devastating natural disasters.As wildfires raged across Los Angeles, claiming lives and homes, Mayor Bass returned from a controversial trip to Ghana just as her city was engulfed by flames. In a confrontation that has been described as nothing short of ""shocking,"" Bass was confronted by Blevins at the airport, who fired off a series of pointed questions about her absence during the crisis.“Do you owe citizens an apology for being absent while their homes were burning? And do you regret cutting the fire department budget by millions of dollars?” Blevins asked, holding a microphone up to the mayor, who remained eerily silent. Bass, who had already been criticized for flying out of the country despite urgent weather warnings, stared at the floor, refusing to engage.As Blevins continued his relentless questioning, the mayor remained stone-faced and unmoving, visibly avoiding any direct response. “Have you absolutely nothing to say to the citizens today?” Blevins pressed, his voice unwavering.But the most cutting moment came when Blevins brought up a comment made by tech mogul Elon Musk, who had labeled the mayor “utterly incompetent” in light of the disaster. “Elon Musk says that you’re utterly incompetent. Are you considering your position?” Blevins asked.Bass, unfazed, turned away from the microphone, offering nothing but silence as she shuffled toward an exit door.The footage, now widely shared across social media, has fueled widespread outrage. Many are calling it the most damning video of a politician during a disaster, with critics accusing Bass of being out of touch with the crisis unfolding in her city. ""The lady's not for talking,"" Blevins remarked after the encounter, succinctly capturing the essence of the mayor’s response.While Bass made no attempt to address the concerns raised by the journalist, the gravity of the situation is undeniable. Since the wildfires began on Tuesday, at least five people have been killed, over 1,000 buildings destroyed, and more than 150,000 residents have been ordered to evacuate. The fires, whipped into a frenzy by fierce Santa Ana winds, have ravaged some of LA's most vulnerable areas, including the wealthy Pacific Palisades neighborhood.Critics have not only slammed Bass for her failure to return to Los Angeles sooner, but they’ve also highlighted her controversial decision to cut $17.6 million from the city's fire department budget, despite the growing threat of wildfires. Many are now questioning her leadership, with some even calling for her resignation.In stark contrast, Bass’s silence has drawn attention to her handling of the crisis, especially when compared to other political figures like California Governor Gavin Newsom , who has been on the frontlines since the fires broke out. Newsom, who was also seen touring the devastated areas alongside Bass, has been vocal in his support for first responders and the thousands of residents affected by the fires.The video of Bass’s stone-cold demeanor in the face of such dire circumstances is raising alarms about her leadership, with many wondering if she is truly fit for office in times of crisis. As Los Angeles continues to grapple with the aftermath of the wildfires, the public’s faith in its mayor seems to be at an all-time low.","Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass returned from a controversial trip to Ghana just as her city was engulfed by flames.

Armed outlaws in Pakistan's Punjab province kidnapped three Hindus and issued an ultimatum, demanding the release of their accomplices from police custody.The incident took place in the Bhong area of Rahim Yar Khan district, around 400 kilometers southwest of Lahore, on Wednesday.The victims, identified as Shaman, Shameer, and Sajan, were near the Chowk Sawetra Basic Health Unit (BHU) in Bhong when five armed dacoits abducted them at gunpoint and took them to the Katcha riverine area, a region notorious for criminal activity.In a video released later by the outlaws’ ringleader Ashiq Korai, the gang threatened Ahmedpur Lama police station officer Rana Ramzan, warning that if Korai’s 10 family members were not freed, the kidnapped youths would be killed.The gang also threatened to attack the police. The video showed the abducted Hindus in chains, pleading for their release.The incident shows the ongoing lawlessness in the Katcha area, a riverine belt spanning parts of southern Punjab and Sindh provinces. Despite multiple operations, authorities have struggled to curb the power of these criminal gangs, who frequently engage in kidnappings for ransom and target minority Hindu communities to pressure authorities into compliance.Last year, the region witnessed a deadly attack on police, with 12 officers killed and seven injured when dacoits ambushed two police vehicles in the same district.","Armed outlaws in Pakistan's Punjab province kidnapped three Hindus and issued an ultimatum, demanding the release of their accomplices from police custody.

BALOCHISTAN: Two young men have reportedly been forcibly disappeared by Pakistani security forces in Balochistan's Dera Bugti district, according to a report by the Balochistan Post.The victims, identified as Ashref, the son of Bhora Khan Bugti, and Pato Khan, the son of Siraj Bugti, were allegedly detained by Frontier Corps (FC) personnel. As of now, their whereabouts remain unknown, the Balochistan Post reported.Enforced disappearances have been a persistent issue in Balochistan, with human rights groups accusing Pakistan's security forces and intelligence agencies of being complicit in the practice. Activists argue that such abductions, often without due process or legal justification, target civilians and exacerbate fear in the region.The case of Ashref and Pato Khan is part of a broader pattern of disappearances in the area. According to the Balochistan Post, in December alone, eight individuals were reported missing in Dera Bugti, underscoring the continued prevalence of this issue in the province.Families of the disappeared often face considerable difficulties in seeking justice or information about their loved ones. Despite growing international criticism, the practice remains widespread, fuelling tensions in the volatile region.Recently, Pakistan's security forces have reportedly abducted four individuals in the Kech district of Balochistan, with their families still unaware of their whereabouts, according to the Balochistan Post.The victims have been identified as Ramzan Baloch, Shagarullah, Sher Jan Ishaq, and Farooq Ishaq. Ramzan Baloch, an employee of the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA), was taken into custody on Monday at 7 pm (local time) in the town of Mand. The fate of the abducted individuals remains unclear, and their families are left in distress, unable to obtain any information on their detention or location.The ongoing enforced disappearances in Balochistan highlight a grave human rights crisis, with victims' families facing uncertainty and fear, while the international community calls for accountability and an end to such abuses.","Two young men have reportedly been forcibly disappeared by Pakistani security forces in Balochistan's Dera Bugti district.

They were outraged about frequent power disruptions in GB.Local officials said 700 trucks, including vehicles loaded with imports and exports, have been stuck at the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ) dry port due to the sit-in by various political parties, including the Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), members of civil society and trade associations. “Trucks transporting goods from China are stuck at the dry port, while Pakistani trucks meant to transport goods within the country are stranded at various locations within Hunza,” Imran Ali, president of GB’s chamber of commerce and industry, told media.He said traders were facing serious problems due to the situation. “The machinery to remove snow from the border has also been stuck on the way, the process of restoring the border has not even started,” Ali added.Local residents said many tourists going to the region to enjoy the snowfall at the Pakistan-China border were returning.
