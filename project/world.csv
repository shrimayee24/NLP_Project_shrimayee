'Juvenile terrorist': 11-year-old arrested for threatening Florida schools with bombs and shootings

An 11-year-old boy from Henrico County, Virginia, was arrested for making over 20 violent threats to schools in multiple states, including Florida. He targeted several schools and made bomb and shooting threats. The boy admitted to the crimes, and disturbing content was found in his possession. He now faces multiple felony and misdemeanor charges.

NEW DELHI: A school in south Delhi’s Kailash Colony received a bomb threat via email on Friday. However, after a meticulous search, it was found to be a hoax . A 14-year-old kid has been identified as the suspect.“The administration of Summer Fields School reported receiving an email message at 12.30 am at the school’s email address. The content of the email insinuated that an explosive device had been surreptitiously planted within the school premises, thereby posing an imminent threat to the safety and well-being of the students and staff,” a senior police officer said.“Tomorrow there will be a blast at the school,” the email read.The officer said that in the email, it was written that “the sender is a Pakistani General.” The mail also urged school authorities to take the email seriously.“A bomb disposal squad team, along with the local police, swiftly arrived at the school and meticulously scoured the entire premises for any traces of the alleged explosive device. Despite their comprehensive search for over two hours, no suspicious objects or explosive materials were uncovered, much to the relief of everyone involved,” the officer stated further. After an initial probe, the boy was identified as the suspect. He allegedly sent the mail because he did not want to go to school the next day, police sources said. So far, the boy has not been apprehended.This was not the first time such an incident happened in Delhi. On May 1, at least 200 schools received emails which warned them about a bomb on their premises, leading to widespread panic.Later, several hospitals, IGI Airport and Tihar Jail had received hoax emails about bombs at their premises. Next were colleges, as at least 15 of them in Delhi were targeted by bomb threats.","Summer Fields School in Delhi's Greater Kailash area received a bomb threat via email.

BAREILLY: An angry mob took matters into its own hands at a village in UP and set on fire the house of a 21-year-old man for allegedly eloping with a woman, 20, of another community from the same neighbourhood.When police arrived at the scene on Friday night, the mob vandalised their vehicle too.The cops somehow managed to escape and informed their superiors, who sent additional forces from nearby police stations to bring the situation under control.SSP (Bareilly), Anurag Arya, said on Saturday, ""The incident took place at Chandupura Shivnagar under Sirauli limits of Bareilly district. There was a complaint that a 20-year-old woman had eloped with her neighbour Mohd Saddam on July 29. Both were traced on Thursday night and the woman was handed over to her father on Friday. Saddam was detained for questioning. Later at night, a few anti-social elements vandalised some items at Saddam's house and set a charpoy on fire. An FIR was registered against the perpetrators -- 21 identified and 30 unknown -- under the BNS section of rioting, and another FIR was registered against Saddam for abduction on the complaint of the woman's father.""Arya added: ""SHO of Sirauli, Luv Sirohi, sub-inspector Satveer Singh and a constable were suspended for negligence. Over 100 police personnel are now deployed in the village to maintain law and order. Further investigations are on.""An official, privy to the case details, said, ""The village has around 10% minority population and the main occupation is farming. The Hindu woman and Saddam are school dropouts and fell in love over two years ago. On July 29, they fled together and the woman's father filed a missing complaint. He, however, gave in writing that he didn't want any action against Saddam. But, on Friday night, the situation turned violent. The mob broke the house door, vandalised items inside and set it on fire. Dial 112 team arrived and came under attack as well. Additional forces were thereafter called in.""Locals at Chandupura Shivnagar said that ""no one is in favour of violence"" and appreciated the police presence. Village head, Pravesh Kumar, told TOI: ""There was never any communal tension here and we always lived in peace. Situation turned ugly after the Muslim man eloped with the daughter of a farmer. Since people from the woman's community are more in number; they targeted Saddam's house."" The woman's mother said, ""Saddam and his aides often used to threaten my daughter. He took her away forcefully and villagers became angry and attacked their house. We just want them to stay away from our daughters.""","The incident took place at Chandupura Shivnagar under Sirauli limits of Bareilly district.

MEPPADI (WAYANAD) : Punchirimattom , a picturesque hamlet in the valley beneath the towering Mundakkai hills was the first to be hit by the huge landslide , suffering the worst impact.As the name suggests, ‘punchiri’ (smile) in its name refers to the striking scenic beauty of the area due to the tall hills blanketed with forests and cardamom plantations.But the smile has waned as survivors even dread at the thought of returning.Punchirimattom, which had nearly 60 houses, was flattened in a matter of seconds as the landslide obliterated everything in its path. Mundakkai, which is 2km downstream, at least has rubbles and wreckage of a few buildings.Kallingal Unnikrishnan is a lucky survivor, whose house was among the first at Punchirimattom to be flattened, now dreads even to step foot on his native land. Unnikrishnan, a daily wage earner, lost his wife who had gone to her sister’s house at Chooralmala.“I didn’t want to come here but did so today after my friends insisted. This was the land which we all loved so much and I had toiled for years to build our dream house. But after the trauma that left so much devastation , it is haunting to be back here. I was inside the house when the landslide struck at around 1.30am. It was like a helicopter flying close. Half of my house crumbled down and I ran up to the second floor and stood there witnessing the horror of debris flowravaging everything around, including my neighbour’s house,” said Unnikrishnan. When I called my wife’s relative, she said that my wife Shyja, her sister, sisterin-law and brother-in-law were missing, he added.Abdul Latheef Kurikkal, who was working in the Gulf, reached Puthirimattom on hearing of the landslide having swept away his house. But his family members managed to survive. “Our house stood just 50m away from the river and, it is just a flat ground. Same is the case with my daughter’s house and of my brothers. Luckily my family members managed to save their lives as they had moved to houses of relatives on Monday,” he said.Kurikkal said they were proud of their land, which was an idyllic haven with several tourist spots like Seethamma Kund and a small waterbody where tourists frequented. However, those areas have now become blank spaces.Over 100 connections at Punchirimattom have been lost and KSEB connections cannot be restored as the topography of the entire area has been transformed, said overseer Abdul Saleem Manjileri.","Punchirimattom, a picturesque hamlet in the valley beneath the towering Mundakkai hills, was the first to be hit by the huge landslide.

He said they should go to war against the anti-child ideology that exists in the country. He said millennial feminist writers have been talking about why having kids is not a good thing and encouraged people with children to talk about why they regret having children.

The FIR, filed against her under IPC Sec 305, was based on the victim's suicide note, where she named the teacher. The note said that sister Elizabeth had taken away ID cards of the victim and her classmates.The petitioner's counsel argued that the teacher had no prior interaction with the deceased, as she taught only Class IV students. On the day of the incident, she had merely admonished the student and taken her ID card 'as part of usual disciplinary procedures at the school'. The counsel emphasised that the petitioner had no intention of causing her harm and that her actions were ""misinterpreted by the deceased's overactive imagination and the influence of her peers"".The state counsel, however, argued that from the FIR, it is apparent that the victim was uncomfortable and fell ill when she returned home from school after which she wrote the note and died by suicide.The court said that subjecting a child to corporal punishment to reform him / her ""cannot be part of education"". It dismissed the petition, noting that material on record was sufficient to proceed with charges against the petitioner.","Chhattisgarh HC dismisses a teacher's plea to quash a chargesheet against her after a Class VI girl died by suicide.

Officials said a total of 22 coaching centres were surveyed, out of which three centres were found operating illegally from basements and were sealed.The move comes a week after the basement of a UPSC coaching centre in Delhi was flooded, claiming the lives of three aspirants.MCG commissioner Narhari Singh Banger has directed joint commissioners of all zones to initiate a campaign to crack down on coaching centres running from basements without authorisation , officials said.The centres sealed on Saturday were operating in Sector 14's Old DLF Colony, Krishna Colony, and Khandsa Road. MCG's enforcement teams are carrying out a survey of coaching centres across the city, including sectors 4, 7, 14, 42, 44 and 55, and Sushant Lok 1 and 2.The teams have directed all coaching centres to submit their documents for verification at the MCG office on Monday. The centres will have to submit documents such as MCG permit, building plan and fire NOC.If any centre is found flouting the norms, action will be taken against them, the commissioner said. ""We have initiated a targeted initiative to avert disasters similar to the one that occurred at the coaching centre in Delhi. It is crucial to adhere to safety regulations for basement structures and ensure that emergency exits remain unobstructed during any unforeseen incidents,"" Banger said.On the night of July 27, three students of Rau's IAS Study Circle in Delhi's Old Rajinder Nagar were trapped in the basement after water from a drain gushed into the room. Shreya Yadav, Tanya Soni and Nivin Dalwin - all in their 20s and preparing for the public services examination - drowned.There were allegations that the door to the basement had been upgraded to one with a biometric system and got jammed when the water gushed in.Seven persons, including the owner of the institute, have been arrested. Since then, dozens of institutes running out of crammed buildings have been sealed across Delhi-NCR for throwing caution to the wind.","The move comes a week after the basement of a UPSC coaching centre in Delhi was flooded, claiming the lives of three aspirants.

Occupy potholes: Assagao bus operators start protest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/occupy-potholes-assagao-bus-operators-start-protest/articleshow/112253245.cms,"Govt has been given an eight-day ultimatum to repair the roads

Panaji:

Irked by the dilapidated condition of roads in Assagao , private bus operators lodged their protest in a novel manner by sitting in protest inside the water-filled potholes .The bus drivers and conductors have given govt an eight-day ultimatum to restore the roads, failing which they will launch a fast unto death protest.The bus owners also used their buses to fill some of the potholes with stones and rubble.The operators said that the 4km stretch in Assagao has been riddled with potholes for more than eight months, with govt making no effort to repair and resurface the road.“We, bus conductors and drivers, are poor people. We have been suffering for eight months. We have no other option because we have run out of patience,” said a bus driver.He added that the roads have been dug up by the electricity department, the public works department and other govt agencies, but no restoration has yet been undertaken. They said that the potholed roads affect their business.“Suspension of our buses get damaged, tyres get punctured, gearboxes are getting damaged. This is a slow poison to destroy our livelihood. Each bus provides income for two individuals. This govt cannot give people jobs and now they are finishing our jobs too,” said the driver.They said that if govt cannot repair the roads, it should take over the buses and operate the buses.","Bus drivers and conductors have given govt an eight-day ultimatum to restore the roads.

Schumer predicts senate victory for Democrats with Harris as frontrunner,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/schumer-predicts-senate-victory-for-democrats-with-harris-as-frontrunner/articleshow/112252153.cms,"Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer expressed strong optimism that Democrats will maintain control of the Senate in the upcoming November election. Schumer's confidence is bolstered by the newfound enthusiasm with Vice President Kamala Harris leading the Democratic ticket, a shift that has invigorated the party's supporters and candidates.Schumer played a significant behind-the-scenes role in influencing President Joe Biden 's decision to exit the reelection race.This move has unexpectedly energized Democrat campaigns across various states, defying prior concerns about a challenging Senate map that features competitive races in regions favoring former President Donald Trump.""We are so enthusiastic about the prospects of winning the presidency, keeping the Senate, and winning the House,"" Schumer stated in an interview with The Associated Press.Schumer emphasized the stark contrasts between Democrats and Republicans , particularly following controversial remarks from Trump and his running mate JD Vance, who have made headlines for their criticisms of Harris and women without children.""The best thing Donald Trump did since he won the nomination was pick Vance - for Democrats,"" Schumer commented, referring to the Republican senator from Ohio.Schumer highlighted the rapid increase in excitement, donations, and volunteer support that has emerged since Harris was put forward as the party’s leading candidate. This surge has significantly altered the previously bleak outlook for Senate DemocratsRepublicans, however, remain unconvinced about the longevity of the Democrats' newfound optimism, expecting that the current momentum will wane and diminish the party’s chances of retaining Senate control . They are positioning Harris as a candidate out of touch with mainstream voters, branding her as a ""California liberal.""""If you like San Francisco politics, you're going to love Kamala Harris,"" said Senator Steve Daines, R-Mont., who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Harris' political career began as San Francisco's district attorney and progressed to California’s attorney general before she became a senator.Since Biden's withdrawal from the race, down-ballot political dynamics have started to shift, realigning in response to the new landscape mere months before the critical election. The Senate races , once perceived as favoring Republicans, are now in flux.The Senate map presents a challenging battlefield for Democrats, who hold a slim one-seat majority and face defending multiple seats in pro-Trump territories such as Montana and Ohio. Particularly concerning is the likely loss of the West Virginia seat currently held by retiring Senator Joe Manchin to popular Republican Governor Jim Justice.Republicans only need to gain one additional Democrat-held seat to regain Senate control, assuming they hold on to their current seats in states such as Texas, where Senator Ted Cruz is challenged by Democratic Representative Colin Allred, and Florida, where Senator Rick Scott is up against Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, a former congresswoman.Daines sees numerous opportunities for Republicans to gain in states where Democratic seats are considered vulnerable. He pointed to particularly competitive races in Montana and Ohio, predicting close contests for Senators Jon Tester and Sherrod Brown, respectively. In Maryland, Republicans have recruited former Governor Larry Hogan to challege Democrat Angela Alsobrooks, who aims to become one of the few Black women to serve in the Senate.""The Democrats have to pitch a perfect game. We have to win one of them,"" Daines noted. ""I like our odds.""Schumer remains confident that Senate Democrats can hold their ground by campaigning on Biden’s legislative achievements, such as investments in infrastructure and manufacturing. He additionally highlighted the Republican challengers’ connections to Trump and Vance as a potential advantage for the Democrats.With Harris at the top of the ticket, Schumer sees an opportunity for Democrats to harness the increased energy and enthusiasm among their base. ""People are knocking down the doors"" to volunteer for Senate races, he reported.Reflecting on the rapid developments, Schumer admitted he was somewhat taken aback by the swift surge in support for Harris after Biden's decision, though not entirely surprised given the circumstances.Schumer recounted a private visit with Biden at the president's beach home in mid-July, where he shared concerns raised by Democratic senators about Biden’s performance in a debate against Trump. Their conversation had a significant impact.""We had a very good meeting and hugged at the end,"" Schumer recounted. He expressed admiration for the collaborative efforts during Biden’s presidency.

Who are the far-right groups behind the UK riots?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/who-are-the-far-right-groups-behind-the-uk-riots/articleshow/112257148.cms,"Here is what we know about the unrest and some of those involved.

Where have riots taken place?

Which groups are behind the unrest?

What is the English Defence League?

Why is the disorder so hard to quash?

Violent unrest has erupted in several towns and cities in Britain in recent days, and further disorder broke out Saturday as far-right agitators gathered in demonstrations around the country.The violence has been driven by online disinformation and extremist right-wing groups intent on creating disorder after a deadly knife attack on a children’s event in northwestern England, experts said.A range of far-right factions and individuals, including neo-Nazis, violent soccer fans and anti-Muslim campaigners, have promoted and taken part in the unrest, which has also been stoked by online influencers.Prime Minister Keir Starmer has vowed to deploy additional police officers to crack down on the disorder. “This is not a protest that has got out of hand,” he said Thursday. “It is a group of individuals who are absolutely bent on violence.”The first riot took place Tuesday evening in Southport, a town in northwestern England, after a deadly stabbing attack the previous day at a children’s dance and yoga class. Three girls died of their injuries, and eight other children and two adults were wounded.The suspect, Axel Rudakubana, was born in Britain, but in the hours after the attack, disinformation about his identity — including the false claim that he was a migrant living in the country illegally — spread rapidly online. Far-right activists used messaging apps including Telegram and X to urge people to take to the streets.More than 200 people descended on Southport Tuesday night, many traveling by train from elsewhere in Britain, police said. Rioters attacked a mosque, wounded more than 50 police officers and set vehicles alight.On Wednesday night, another far-right demonstration brought clashes with the police in central London, leading to more than 100 arrests. Smaller pockets of disorder broke out in Hartlepool, in northeastern England; in the city of Manchester; and in Aldershot, a town southeast of London.On Friday night, Northumbria Police said its officers had been “subjected to serious violence” as far-right demonstrators set fires and attacked officers in Sunderland, a city in the northeast.On Saturday, activists clashed police in the northern cities of Liverpool, Hull and Nottingham, among other places.The chair of the National Police Chiefs’ Council, Gavin Stephens, told BBC Radio on Friday that extra officers would be on Britain’s streets and that police would use lessons learned from the 2011 London riots.“We will have surge capacity in our intelligence, in our briefing and in the resources that are out in local communities,” he said.Several far-right groups have been at the riots or promoted them on social media. David Miles, a prominent member of Patriotic Alternative, a fascist group, shared photographs of himself in Southport, according to Hope Not Hate, a Britain-based advocacy group that researches extremist organizations .Other far-right agitators spread information about the protest on social media, including British Movement, a neo-Nazi group. Images of the protests examined by Hope Not Hate showed some people with Nazi tattoos.After the disorder in Southport, police said supporters of the English Defence League had been involved. The riots have also attracted people linked to soccer violence, or hooliganism, which has long overlapped with nationalist movements in Britain.Officials noted that not everyone at the demonstrations had far-right views. David Hanson, a Cabinet minister, told LBC Radio on Friday: “Some might be caught up in the summer madness. Some might be people who’ve got genuine concerns.”But, he warned, “If you are organizing this now, we will be watching you.”Created in 2009, the English Defence League was a far-right street movement notorious for violent protests and an anti-Islam, anti-immigration stance.The group emerged in Luton, England, where community tensions had risen after a handful of Islamic extremists chanted abuse at British soldiers returning home from Iraq. Luton was already associated with Islamist extremism, because it was home to a small number of adherents to Al Muhajiroun, an extremist group implicated in the 2005 London bombings.Among the English Defence League founders was Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, who goes by the name Tommy Robinson. Born in Luton, he was at one time a member of the far-right British National Party. He also had connections to soccer violence and was convicted of leading soccer fans in a brawl in Luton in 2010.In the group’s early years, regional divisions carried out local demonstrations, including protests over planned mosques, and engaged in actions such as placing pig heads around Muslim sites.According to Matthew Feldman, a specialist on right-wing extremism, the group represented a new stage in far-right British politics, because unlike the National Front or the British National Party, it did not contest elections.“This is direct-action politics, disseminated and coordinated via the new media — ranging from Facebook to mobile phones, and digital film to YouTube,” Feldman wrote in a 2011 academic study of the English Defence League.In 2013, Yaxley-Lennon said he had broken ties with the league. And after leadership disputes and internal divisions, the group no longer formally exists. But experts say that many of its supporters remain active through other nationalist groups with similar aims and tactics.In the later 2010s, Yaxley-Lennon rose to prominence in international circles that shared his anti-Muslim stance, including in Europe and the United States. In the past week, he has used social media, including a previously banned X profile that was reinstated under Elon Musk, to promote falsehoods about the identity of the Southport attacker.Nowadays, experts say the English Defence League has evolved into a diffuse idea spread mainly online. Its Islamophobic and xenophobic stance has become an “ideal that people self-radicalize themselves into,” said Sunder Katwala, director of British Future, a nonprofit that researches public attitudes on immigration and identity.Many far-right groups in Britain have deliberately moved away from formal hierarchies and leadership structures, experts say.Joe Mulhall, Hope Not Hate’s director of research, called the movement “post organizational” in a 2018 analysis. Social media and other technologies, he wrote, offer “new ways for it to engage in activism outside the confines of traditional, organizational structures.”Violent street rallies, a core part of the English Defence League’s rise, often serve as a recruiting tool for extremist groups, according to Paul Jackson, a University of Northampton professor who specializes in the history of radicalism and extremism.“Social movements thrive on such demonstrations,” he wrote in a 2011 paper. “They are ‘performances’ that can reinforce the perceived senses of injustice and being ignored by mainstream voices to followers.”Police may struggle to respond to mobs that can be conjured within hours through private messaging apps. According to Feldman, “police are still oftentimes thinking in 20th-century terms — that something like this might take a few days to set up; that they might ask for a permit for a march.”The Southport riot, he said, “was very nearly a flash demo.”","Violent unrest has erupted in several towns and cities in Britain in recent days.

Trump’s federal election interference case resumes after long pause,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-federal-election-interference-case-resumes-after-long-pause/articleshow/112257131.cms,"After a nearly eight-month hiatus, former President Donald Trump 's federal election interference case is back in motion. On Saturday, Judge Tanya Chutkan scheduled a hearing for August 16 in Washington to discuss the next steps in the case, which had been stalled due to a Supreme Court ruling on Trump's immunity.The Supreme Court's landmark decision last month granted Trump broad immunity against criminal prosecution for actions taken during his presidency.However, the ruling left unresolved the matter of whether Trump’s alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 election results, detailed in the indictment, could proceed to trial.The upcoming hearing will address how to handle this complex fact-finding mission. Judge Chutkan will confer with Trump’s lawyers and special counsel Jack Smith’s team to determine which parts of the indictment can advance and which are protected under presidential immunity .While Saturday's scheduling of the hearing was procedural, it marks the first substantive action in the case since December. The Supreme Court's decision on immunity was issued on July 1, but the formal mandate was only executed on Friday, returning the case to the lower courts.Judge Chutkan's order instructs both defense and prosecution to submit proposals for pretrial proceedings by next Friday. The details of how the fact-finding will be conducted—whether through written briefs or a more detailed hearing—are yet to be determined.","Judge Tanya Chutkan scheduled a hearing for August 16 in Washington to discuss the next steps in the case.

Donald Trump sparks new feud with Georgia governor: 'Little Brian' slammed as 'disloyal'; Kemp fires back,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-sparks-new-feud-with-georgia-governor-little-brianslammed-as-disloyal-kemp-fires-back/articleshow/112256954.cms,"Donald Trump reignited his feud with Georgia’s Republican Governor Brian Kemp on Saturday as he campaigned in the crucial swing state, where he is working to reverse his narrow 2020 loss to President Joe Biden. Trump's criticism of Kemp was fueled by his ongoing grievances over the 2020 election results and the role of GOP officials who did not support his unfounded claims of election fraud.Before his rally , Trump attacked Kemp on his social media platform, Truth Social, accusing him of prioritizing ""Unity and the Republican Party"" over combating crime. Trump also criticized Kemp's wife, Marty, for planning to write in her husband's name rather than voting for the Republican nominee in the upcoming election.At the rally, Trump delivered a roughly 10-minute tirade against Kemp, calling him a “bad guy,” “disloyal,” and “very average.” He also referred to him derogatorily as “Little Brian, Little Brian Kemp.”In response, Kemp took to X (formerly Twitter) to urge Trump to “leave my family out of it” and criticized him for engaging in “petty personal insults” and focusing on past grievances rather than current issues. “Stop attacking fellow Republicans,” Kemp added.The clash comes as Georgia is poised for another tightly contested election, with Democrats energized by Biden’s endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris. To secure a win, Trump will need to garner support from Kemp’s political network and moderate voters, beyond his base.Trump’s rally in Atlanta, Georgia’s largest media market, attracted thousands of supporters. Among them was Draic Coakley, a 23-year-old trucking industry worker from Heflin, Alabama, who attended his third Trump rally. Coakley expressed his belief that Trump “gets us” and contrasted him with what he sees as the elitism of Biden and Harris.In the 2020 election, Biden won Georgia by 11,779 votes. Trump’s attempts to overturn the results included pressuring Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to “find” votes and presenting slates of “fake electors.” Trump was indicted in Georgia for his efforts, but the case is on hold pending court decisions.Kemp, who certified Biden’s electors and resisted Trump’s efforts to replace them, has managed to maintain his position of influence within the GOP. Despite Trump’s endorsement of Kemp's primary rival in 2022, Kemp won reelection decisively against Democrat Stacey Abrams and is expected to chair the Republican Governors Association for the 2026 cycle.Conservative commentator Erick Erickson criticized Trump for his focus on personal attacks rather than uniting the party. “Trump can’t help himself,” Erickson wrote on X. “If he loses, it’ll be because of this stuff, not a stolen election.”While both parties are concentrating on Georgia, recent Democratic efforts have shifted focus to the Midwest following Biden’s campaign exit. Trump’s allies have urged him to concentrate on key issues like the economy and immigration, areas where they believe he holds an advantage over Harris.Trump’s running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance, used the rally to attack Harris, describing her as a “San Francisco liberal” and claiming Trump had “exposed a massive coverup” during the debates that led to Biden’s withdrawal from the race.The Harris campaign preemptively criticized Trump’s rally, predicting he would continue to deny the 2020 election results and expressed disappointment over his decision to propose a debate with Harris on Fox News instead of attending a previously agreed-upon debate.Former Georgia Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan, who has repudiated Trump, commented after the rally, accusing Trump of prioritizing his own grievances over the needs of the country. “Millions of Americans are fed up with his grievance-filled campaign focused only on himself,” Duncan said.","Donald Trump reignited his feud with Georgia's Republican Governor Brian Kemp on Saturday as he campaigned in the crucial swing state.

Florida braces for Debby: Fourth named storm set to become hurricane,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/florida-braces-for-debby-fourth-named-storm-set-to-become-hurricane/articleshow/112256872.cms,"Tropical Storm Debby formed north of Cuba on Saturday, rapidly intensifying as it charted a path through the Gulf of Mexico toward Florida . The National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) has now predicted that Debby will likely strengthen into a hurricane before making landfall .With maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 kph), Debby was situated approximately 100 miles (160 kilometers) west-southwest of Key West, Florida, and was moving northwest at 14 mph (22 kph).The storm's reach already extends over a vast area, impacting southern Florida, the Florida Keys, and the Bahamas with wind and thunderstorms.Forecasters anticipate that Debby will bring heavy rain and coastal flooding to much of Florida’s Gulf Coast by Sunday night, with the potential to make landfall as a hurricane on Monday. The storm is expected to cross northern Florida and enter the Atlantic Ocean, where it may continue to affect the southeastern United States.This marks the fourth named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, following Tropical Storm Alberto, Hurricane Beryl, and Tropical Storm Chris—all of which formed in June.As Debby approaches, the NHC has issued a hurricane warning for parts of the Big Bend and the Florida Panhandle. Tropical storm warnings are also in effect for Florida’s West Coast, southern Florida Keys, and the Dry Tortugas, with a tropical storm watch extending farther west into the Panhandle.The NHC predicts 6 to 12 inches (150 to 300 mm) of rain for affected areas, with isolated totals reaching up to 18 inches (450 mm), raising concerns about flash and urban flooding. Rivers along Florida’s West Coast are also at risk of moderate flooding. Coastal areas, including Tampa Bay, could see storm surges of 2 to 4 feet (0.6 to 1.2 meters), with a surge of up to 7 feet (2.1 meters) expected in the Big Bend region.Local officials have initiated evacuation orders in vulnerable areas, particularly in Citrus and Levy counties, where coastal residents are urged to seek safer ground. Shelters have opened in multiple counties to accommodate evacuees.In preparation for Debby, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has declared a state of emergency across 61 counties, and the National Guard has activated 3,000 members to assist with response efforts. Georgia Governor Brian Kemp has also issued an emergency proclamation in anticipation of the storm's impact.As the storm looms, residents and officials are taking precautions. In Tampa, more than 30,000 sandbags have been distributed to help protect homes from potential flooding. Coastal businesses and marinas, like the Blue Pelican Marina in Hernando Beach, are securing equipment and tying down boats in preparation for the storm.Despite the warnings, some residents, like Betti Silverman of Crystal River, remain hesitant to evacuate, recalling past experiences with storms. However, authorities continue to emphasize the potential dangers, urging everyone in affected areas to stay vigilant and prepared.Meanwhile, in the Pacific Ocean, Hurricane Carlotta and Tropical Storm Daniel continue their courses, although neither is expected to make landfall. Carlotta is gradually losing strength, and Daniel is forecasted to dissipate into a remnant of thunderstorms.As Florida braces for the impact of Debby, memories of previous storms with the same name resurface, particularly the devastating 2012 tropical storm that caused significant damage and loss of life. Residents and officials are hoping for a less severe outcome this time, but remain prepared for the worst.","Tropical Storm Debby formed north of Cuba on Saturday, rapidly intensifying as it charted a path through the Gulf of Mexico toward Florida.

Eventually the United States and dozens of other countries recognized the then-speaker of parliament, Juan Guaido, as Venezuela's acting president.But Guaido failed to remove Maduro from office as many had hoped he would, and the once wildly popular young politician has largely faded from public life.""We are at the beginning of a new era, the era of the consolidation of the revolution, the era of well-being,"" 69-year-old professor Ali Garcia said at the rally.Maduro, 61, has slammed the international criticism, describing allegations of vote fraud as a ""trap"" orchestrated by Washington to justify ""a coup.""The opposition has launched a website with copies of 84 percent of ballots cast, showing an easy win for Gonzalez Urrutia. The government claims these are forged.Maduro has led the oil-rich, cash-poor country since 2013, presiding over a GDP drop of 80 percent that pushed more than seven million of once-wealthy Venezuela's 30 million citizens to emigrate.Experts blame economic mismanagement and US sanctions for the collapse.Maduro has maintained power thanks to loyalty from the military leadership, electoral bodies, courts and other state institutions, as well as the backing of Russia, China and Cuba.- Security -Maduro on Saturday also said ""military and police patrols"" would continue throughout the country to ""protect the people.""Rights groups reported 11 dead in protests Monday and Tuesday as angry Venezuelans took to the streets.Maduro said two officers were killed, and 2,000 people detained. He has said his administration was preparing two maximum security prisons to hold protest-related inmates.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke Friday with Machado and Gonzalez Urrutia, expressing ""his concern for their safety and well-being"" and congratulating Gonzalez Urrutia ""for receiving the most votes,"" the State Department said.Venezuela emigres in cities across the Americas also rallied Saturday against Maduro and his claims of victory.""We don't want violence, we just want him to leave, we only want peace,"" 43-year-old Maudie Lopez, a crafts worker, told AFP in Colombia's capital Bogota, where hundreds joined in song and prayer.""I want to return to my country.""Colombia is housing some three million of the seven million Venezuelans who have fled since Maduro came to power.","Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado emerges from hiding, declares ""We have never been so strong"" President Nicolas Maduro slams what he calls attempts to ""usurp the presidency"" Thousands of Maduro supporters respond to his call for ""the mother of all marches"" Brazil, Colombia and Mexico urge an ""impartial verification"" of the result.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112257739,imgsize-1201033,width-400,resizemode-4/112257739.jpg"

JD said his wife was sitting there and three children were sleeping upstairs when the lawyer said he had to ask an intrusive question.""I was like, 'Are you serious?' Do I have a secret family? Like, what do you mean? He said sometimes you know people have another spouse, other kids in a place like Alaska,"" Vance said.""Oh by the way, if I did I am not gonna admit it in front of my wife. It's one of those questions where if you got to that point in your life that you are such a dishonest person and have a secret family in Alaska, I think they would hide it. But no, I don't have a secret family in Alaska,"" Vance said laughing adding that they ask all these weird questions to prepare for the media firestorm.JD detailed how he got to know that he has been named as VP pick by Trump. Because of the ongoing vetting process, he knew he was one of the candidates Trump was shortlisting but the moment it was decided, he was on a plane to Milwaukee without Wi-Fi and on landing, he saw 350 messages.At the hotel room, when he finally got the opportunity to speak to Trump, Trump said, ""JD, you missed a very important phone call and now I'm gonna have to pick somebody else."" JD said his son at that time was talking continuously about Pikachu. ""I told him, son shut hell up for 30 seconds... I have the most important phone call of my life..."" Vance said adding that Trump overheard the conversation and asked him to put the phone of the speaker so that his son could hear the news. ""Trump read the statement and asked my son, 'What do you think about that?' and he said it's pretty cool...and then my whole life changed,"" JD said.JD is married to Indian-origin lawyer Usha Vance. They met at Yale Law school. The couple have three children.

Now look, we want to get people in. We got 59 hostages — I never paid anything.”""I’d like to congratulate Vladimir Putin.” Trump said.“They released some of the greatest killers anywhere in the world,” Trump continued.“Some of the most evil killers they got. And we got our people back, but boy, we made some horrible, horrible deals. And it’s nice to say we got them back, but does that set a bad precedent?”Moving from congratulating Putin, the former president said, “Harris has the most ultra-left-wing agenda of any presidential candidate ever in history.”“She is considered more left-wing then Crazy Bernie Sanders. She is worse than Bernie.”Taking the attack one step further and personal, Trump continued to attack the VP Kamala Harris with this 'low IQ' rant.“She happens to be really a low IQ individual,” Trump said in his attack. “She has a very low IQ. We don’t need a low IQ.”“President Xi of China said, ‘oh good, we have another one, a low-IQ individual,’” Trump said, taking a sideswipe at Biden. “They love dealing with low IQ people, and they got them here. I tell you, we got them all.”Mocking at Biden’s perceived mental decline, Trump added, “They did a coup, he just doesn’t know it.”Meanwhile, Donald Trump declared that he was dropping out of an ABC News debate scheduled for September 10 and announced that he would participate only if it was a Fox news debate six days earlier.The announcement drew flak from Harris, who hit out at Trump for what she saw as an attempt to avoid a fair confrontation.

The announcement drew a sharp reaction from Harris, who criticized Trump for what she saw as an attempt to avoid a fair confrontation.Trump announced his social media platform, Truth Social, saying that the debate would feature a ""full arena audience"" and take place in Pennsylvania, a key battleground state.Trump's proposal echoes the format of the first debate he had with President Joe Biden, who has since exited the reelection race. The second debate was originally planned for September 10 on ABC News, but Trump suggested moving it to Fox News, a network favored by his supporters. Harris, who officially secured the Democratic nomination on Friday, responded by reaffirming her commitment to the original debate date.The change, which Trump announced, raised objections from the Harris campaign and appeared to throw a potential showdown between the rivals into question.A campaign official for Harris on Saturday accused Trump of scheming up the Fox News debate to distract from reneging on his commitment to the ABC debate. Trump had agreed to that debate in May, before President Joe Biden dropped out of the race.“Donald Trump is running scared and trying to back out of the debate he already agreed to and running straight to Fox News to bail him out,” Michael Tyler, communications director for the Harris campaign, said. “He needs to stop playing games and show up to the debate he already committed to on Sept 10.”Tyler said that the Harris campaign was open to discussing further debates if Trump honored his commitment to the ABC debate.A spokesperson for ABC News would not say whether the network would go ahead with its debate and give time only to Harris, reported NYT.Harris took a direct jab at Trump, questioning his sudden change of plans. “It’s interesting how ‘any time, any place’ becomes ‘one specific time, one specific safe space,’” Harris remarked. She reaffirmed her commitment to the scheduled debate, adding, “I’ll be there on September 10th, like he agreed to. I hope to see him there.”According to Trump’s post on his social media site, the Fox News debate would take place on Sept 4 at a to-be-determined location in Pennsylvania. The network’s anchors Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum would moderate.Trump said on social media that the Fox News debate would have a live audience; the previous debate between him and Biden was hosted by CNN in an empty venue. Although both campaigns agreed to the format of the first debate, Trump had bemoaned the lack of a crowd.Besides, at a rally in Atlanta, Georgia, on Saturday night, Trump continued to take jabs at Harris, this time targeting her racial identity. He falsely suggested that Harris had downplayed her Black heritage, an accusation he made earlier to the National Association of Black Journalists. Harris, who is of Indian and Jamaican descent, identifies as both Black and Asian.During the rally, Trump mocked the pronunciation of Harris’ first name and called her a ""lunatic,"" further escalating the personal attacks that have characterized his campaign rhetoric.Trump also claimed that the ABC debate was ""terminated"" due to Biden’s withdrawal and his own ongoing litigation with the network. However, ABC had recently outlined qualification requirements for the debate without mentioning any specific candidates. These requirements, including polling support and state ballot access by September 3, reflect the tight race between Harris and Trump, who had maintained a lead over Biden after the first debate.ABC News and Fox News have both declined to comment on the status of the debate. Trump's proposal for the Fox debate came just after the Democratic National Committee launched an ad campaign accusing him of being ""afraid to debate"" and questioning his stance on abortion.David Plouffe, an adviser to former President Barack Obama who recently joined the Harris campaign, took to social media to criticize Trump’s move. “Now, he seems only comfortable in a cocoon, asking his happy place Fox to host a Trump rally and call it a debate. Maybe he can only handle debating someone his own age,"" Plouffe wrote, highlighting the age difference between Trump, 78, and Harris, 59.","Former President Donald Trump announced that he was dropping out of an ABC News debate scheduled for September 10.

Additionally, over 350,000 supporters participated in their first phone bank, rally, or other campaign activity, representing a 350% increase in event attendees, according to Kanninen.Her campaign announced on Friday that it raised $310 million in July, driven largely by small-dollar donations.

The nanny, identified as Najen Naylor , 47, was employed at the same private school attended by Emhoff's children.According to The Daily Mail, Emhoff allegedly had an affair with Naylor, who was also working as the family's nanny, while he was still married to his ex-wife Kerstin.A close friend of Naylor disclosed the affair and pregnancy to The Daily Mail but mentioned that Naylor did not keep the baby.

Former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser, who addressed reporters alongside the party's secretary-general Omar Ayub Khan outside Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail where the 71-year-old former cricketer-turned-politician is lodged since last August, said that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has decided to expand the opposition alliance in a meeting with Imran Khan on Thursday, Geo News reported.Qaiser announced that the former ruling party would gather all opposition parties to run a powerful anti-government movement. He said that the party's forthcoming power show in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Swabi was aimed at raising a ""strong voice"" for the release of the PTI founder and other detained leaders.""This country will only be governed in accordance with the law and the Constitution,"" Qaiser emphasised.During his address, Qaiser also rebuked the incumbent Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz-led coalition government over skyrocketing power bills.
