Watch: BJP's 'samosa' party amid Himachal CM Sukhu's snack mix-up row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/watch-bjps-samosa-party-amid-himachal-cm-sukhus-snack-mix-up-row/articleshow/115092776.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid the controversy around Himachal Pradesh chief minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu and snack mix-up, BJP leader Jairam Thakur hosted a samosa party with BJP workers at the Circuit House in Mandi.Earlier in the day, CM Sukhu clarified the investigation into the recent samosa-cake mix-up, which erupted after snacks meant for the CM were allegedly served to his security staff. The situation escalated when allegations surfaced that the CID had launched an investigation into the incident. However, both the chief minister and the authorities have denied these allegations.“There is no such thing... It (CID) got involved in the issue of misbehavior,” Himachal CM Sukhu told news agency ANI.The deputy general of CID, Sanjeev Ranjan Ojha also said that it was an internal matter of the CID and should not become a matter of poltics.""This is completely an internal matter of the CID. It should not be politicised. The CM does not eat samosas... We have not given notice to anyone. We have just said to find out what happened. The government has nothing to do with this... We will find out how this information was leaked,"" he said.The controversy snowballed after the CM's visit to the CID headquarters on October 21, where refreshments intended for him were wrongly served to his security detail. According to news agency PTI, the mix-up began when an Inspector General (IG) asked for refreshments, delegating the task to a sub-inspector (SI), who then passed it to an assistant sub-inspector (ASI) and a head constable. The officers collected the sealed snack boxes and informed the SI, who was the only one aware that they were meant for the chief minister. However, further confusion led to the snacks being taken to the mechanical transport (MT) section, where they were mistakenly served to the security staff.This incident did not go down well with the BJP as Jairam Thakur questioned why it was labeled an ""anti-government"" activity.Earlier in the day, Jairam Thakur said, ""Nowadays, the way the government takes decisions in Himachal Pradesh has become a topic of discussion in the whole country because decisions are taken without thinking. Now another topic that is being discussed is that the samosas did not reach where they should have reached, they got lost in the middle and the Chief Minister and the Himachal Pradesh government felt that this is a very serious matter and an investigation should be done on this"".","BJP leader Jairam Thakur hosted a samosa party with BJP workers at the Circuit House in Mandi.

GUWAHATI: A 31-year-old tribal mother of three was allegedly raped and burned to death in her village home in Manipur's Jiribam district late Thursday by armed intruders who terrorised the settlement with indiscriminate gunfire, looting and arson that left 17 dwellings gutted.An FIR based on a complaint filed by the victim's husband with Jiribam police mentions ""rape and murder based on racial and communal grounds"" after ""criminal trespass"". The assailants, suspected to be from the valley, hadn't been identified until late Friday.The man said his wife was ""brutally murdered"" after being sexually assaulted at ""our residence"" in Zairawn village, reviving the horrors of the first few weeks of the ethnic conflict last year, marked by mobs hounding, stripping and raping women at several places in Manipur.Police said they would send the woman's charred body to Silchar in neighbouring Assam for forensic tests. Jiribam SP informed the district magistrate that although the state capital had autopsy and forensic facilities, it was ""very much inconvenient to transport the body from Jirbam to Imphal by road via NH-37 due to the ongoing ethnic crisis"".""This barbaric act serves as yet another chilling reminder of the relentless ethnic-cleansing campaign,"" said Hmar Inpui, the apex organisation of the Hmar tribe.The Indigenous Tribes Advocacy Committee of Pherzawl and Jiribam requested central intervention to safeguard the Kuki-Zomi-Hmar people of the twin tribal-dominant districts.

Broader Implications for the Entertainment Industry

The term "" Diddy List "" refers to a purported compilation of celebrities and public figures allegedly associated with Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' controversial parties, particularly the so-called ""Freak Off"" events. While the authenticity and accuracy of this list are subjects of debate, several high-profile individuals have been mentioned in various reports and online discussions. Notable names include:Leonardo DiCaprio: The acclaimed actor has been linked to Diddy's gatherings, though no official allegations have been made against him.Jay-Z and Beyoncé: The power couple has been mentioned in connection with Diddy's events, but there is no concrete evidence of their involvement in any misconduct.Jennifer Lopez: As Diddy's ex-girlfriend, she has been associated with his parties; however, no allegations have been directed at her.Usher: The singer has been linked to Diddy's events, with some reports suggesting he witnessed inappropriate behavior, though he has not been accused of any wrongdoing.Paris Hilton: The socialite has been reported to attend Diddy's parties, but there are no allegations against her.Kim Kardashian: The reality TV star has been mentioned in connection with Diddy's gatherings, though no evidence suggests her involvement in any misconduct.Russell Brand: The comedian has been linked to Diddy's events, but there are no specific allegations against him.Mariah Carey: The singer has been associated with Diddy's parties, though no allegations have been made against her.Megan Fox: The actress has been mentioned in relation to Diddy's events, but there is no evidence of her involvement in any misconduct.Prince Harry: The British royal has been named in some reports, though there is no concrete evidence linking him to any inappropriate activities.Sean “Diddy” Combs, a major figure in the music industry, is currently at the centre of a series of serious legal battles, including allegations of misconduct and abuse. These developments, involving a mix of allegations, surveillance footage, and testimonies, are attracting significant media attention and sparking wider debates about accountability in the entertainment industry.In May 2024, CNN released a 2016 surveillance video showing Combs allegedly assaulting his former partner, Cassie Ventura, in a California hotel. The video depicts Combs grabbing Ventura by the neck, throwing her to the ground, and dragging her along a hotel corridor. This footage was revealed amid Ventura’s ongoing legal action against Combs, alleging years of abuse—a case reportedly settled shortly after it was filed.Adding to the controversy, Courtney Burgess, a former associate of Combs’ late ex-girlfriend Kim Porter, testified to a grand jury that he has flash drives containing at least eight tapes involving Combs and various celebrities, including alleged minors. Burgess claims these recordings were given to him by Porter before her death in 2018. Homeland Security has subpoenaed Burgess for any related materials as part of the federal investigation.Combs faces multiple charges, including racketeering and trafficking. He has pleaded not guilty and remains in custody without bail. Federal investigators are exploring allegations of Combs hosting “Freak Off” parties, reportedly involving non-consensual acts and male escorts, some of whom were minors. Witnesses have provided detailed accounts of these events, which are under close scrutiny by authorities.Combs’ legal team strongly denies all allegations, stating that any interactions were consensual. They have also accused prosecutors of leaking the 2016 assault video to damage Combs’ reputation ahead of his trial. Prosecutors, however, refute this claim, asserting that they were unaware of the video prior to its release by CNN.Following these developments, Combs filed a motion to expedite a gag order, attempting to curb public statements by potential witnesses. Combs' attorneys argue that such statements are undermining his right to a fair trial and affecting the grand jury’s proceedings. The legal team contends that restricting these extrajudicial comments is necessary to avoid prejudicing the court’s decisions.On October 31, Burgess appeared on NewsNation’s Banfield, alleging that Kim Porter had provided him with 11 flash drives containing videos featuring celebrities, some of whom were minors and allegedly intoxicated. Combs’ lawyers contend that Burgess’ claims, made across various platforms, are sensationalised and without merit, claiming they unfairly prejudice the case. Prosecutors have countered, arguing that the plaintiffs’ involvement in civil litigation places these statements outside criminal court jurisdiction.The allegations against Combs and the suggestion that other high-profile individuals may be involved have reignited discussions about power dynamics within the entertainment sector. Calls for increased transparency and accountability continue to grow, as the industry faces ongoing scrutiny regarding ethics and misconduct.","The term ""Diddy List"" refers to a purported compilation of celebrities and public figures allegedly associated with Diddy's controversial parties.

Barron Trump spent his childhood in the White House and the White House will again get to see a lot of 6'9'' Barron -- as this time he was his father's unofficial social media adviser. Barron is Trump's youngest son with Melania and is studying Business at New York University. Barron will not be a permanent resident of the White House as he will stay in New York for his college and Melania too is unlikely to shift her base to Washington from New York full time.All the Trumps are tall including Melania but Barron's height is shocking and he clearly dominates the room he's in. His father did not miss a chance to speak about his height every time he appeared on a podcast as he also mentioned how smart Barron is and how he knows a lot about the internet, cryptocurrency etc.Donald Trump is believed to be 6 feet 2 inches tall and Melania is 5 feet 9 inches.

Nato and Ukraine remain cautiously optimistic

European leaders' mixed response reveals underlying tensions

Middle East faces uncertainty

The China situation remains complex

Defying pollsters and election experts, Donald Trump is set to return to the White House as the 47th President of the United States of America. Trump emerged victorious against his rival and Democratic candidate Kamala Harris on Wednesday after surpassing the 270 electoral college votes required to win.The international community now watches anxiously to assess if Donald Trump's second stint as president would bring the same level of global instability that his allies anticipate.During his first term, Trump's approach strained relationships with many traditional US partners. His return to the White House carries significant implications across various domains, including worldwide commerce, environmental policies, and numerous international disputes and conflicts.Trump's agenda includes ramping up the tariff war with China, America's emerging economic and military competitor. Regarding the Middle East situation, he has made promises to resolve conflicts involving Israel, Hamas, and Hezbollah. Additionally, he has also committed to resolving the Russia-Ukraine conflict within his first few days in office, raising concerns among Ukraine's supporters about potential concessions favouring Russia.Nato Secretary-General Mark Rutte extended congratulations to Trump, saying, ""I look forward to working with him again to advance peace through strength through Nato"" amidst ""a growing number of challenges globally,"" including ""the increasing alignment of China, Russia, North Korea and Iran.""During his first term as the US president, Trump frequently criticised Nato, questioning other members' financial contributions. His recent statements suggested the USA might not protect Nato members failing to meet defence spending requirements. European officials worry about Trump's committment to Nato, despite his push for increased European military expenditure.Rutte maintained an optimistic stance, acknowledging Trump's previous success in encouraging member states to increase defence spending, noting Nato's enhanced position.European nations are currently assessing contingency plans should American defence support become uncertain.As Ukraine's primary military supporter against Russian aggression, the US relationship remains crucial. ""Do not try to predict Trump's actions. No one knows how he is going to act,"" a Ukrainian MP said.""He could ask Putin to freeze this war, and he says 'OK',"" a front-line soldier was quoted as saying by BBC. ""It's the worst scenario because in a couple of years, the Russians will advance again and might destroy us."" ""The second scenario is if Putin refuses,"" he said. ""There is a chance Trump will react radically. That is a more promising scenario.""Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy endorsed Trump's ""peace through strength"" approach.""This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace in Ukraine closer,"" Zelenskyy wrote on social media. ""I am hopeful that we will put it into action together. We look forward to an era of a strong United States of America under President Trump's decisive leadership.""Zelenskyy later said, ""I had spoken to Trump and congratulated him on ""his historic landslide victory—his tremendous campaign made this result possible. I praised his family and team for their great work. We agreed to maintain close dialogue and advance our cooperation.""Meanwhile, Moscow remained silent, with Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying that US-Russia relations were at their ""lowest point in history.""Leaders across Europe hastened to extend congratulations to Trump, even before official confirmation of his victory.The UK's Prime Minister Keir Starmer described it as a ""historic election victory"" and said that ""as the closest of allies, the U.K. and U.S. will continue to work together to protect our shared values of freedom and democracy."" Starmer's centre-left government has invested considerable effort in establishing connections with Trump and his associates, including a dinner meeting at Trump Tower in September.Emmanuel Macron of France offered measured congratulations with ""respect and ambition,"" whilst German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that ""surely many things will be different under a Donald Trump-led administration"" despite expressing desire for continued close relations.European officials stress upon the enduring nature of transatlantic relations beyond individual leadership, though concerns persist about Trump's protectionist economic policies, given his previous implementation of tariffs on European metals.During his first term as US President, Trump tried to establish diplomatic relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Currently, attention centres on how he will respond to the ongoing conflicts between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, as well as their primary supporter, Iran.Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Trump's victory as ""history's greatest comeback.""""Your historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America. This is a huge victory!"" Netanyahu posted on social media.Despite their previously strong alliance as conservative nationalists, Trump and Netanyahu's relationship deteriorated when Netanyahu acknowledged Biden's 2020 victory. Whilst Netanyahu's close advisers hope for Trump's support against Israel's adversaries, Trump's decisions remain unpredictable. Additionally, Netanyahu faces domestic challenges, including recent nationwide protests following his unexpected dismissal of defence minister Yoav Gallant on Tuesday.Hamas released a brief statement indicating that their stance towards the new US administration would depend on its approach to Palestinian rights and interests.In a congratulatory note to Trump, Chinese President Xi Jinping emphasised the need for both nations to navigate their differences and establish harmony in a new phase of relations.According to Chinese state media, Xi told Trump that historical evidence shows mutual benefits from cooperation, whilst confrontation proves detrimental to both parties.However, Chinese experts remained sceptical, pointing to potential increases in trade tariffs and growing tensions regarding Taiwan. As president, Trump imposed tariffs on over $300 billion of Chinese imports. This time around he has said the tariffs could be in excess of 60%.""It is not all dark, but there are more challenges than opportunities,"" Da Wei, director of the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University in Beijing was quoted as saying by news agency AP. ""We are clear about the challenges. As for opportunities, we are yet to see them clearly.""Ongoing territorial disputes in the South China Sea continue to strain US-China relations in Asia, likely requiring significant attention from the incoming American administration.Leaders across Asia, concerned about China's increasing influence and North Korea's nuclear capabilities, rushed to send congratulatory messages to Trump, seeking his engagement.","Donald Trump is set to return to the White House as the 47th President of the United States of America. The international community now watches anxiously to assess if Donald Trump's second stint as president would bring the same level of global instability that his allies anticipate. European officials worry about Trump's committment to Nato, despite his push for increased European military expenditure.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115052990,imgsize-1149534,width-400,resizemode-4/115052990.jpg"
Hindu temple there for 500 years: Trump’s prospective CIA chief Kash Patel’s pro-Ram Mandir take,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-cia-ram-mandir-kash-patel-hindu-modi/articleshow/115051231.cms,"Kash Patel’s Snap View

One of the more intriguing aspects of this presidential race has been the plethora of Indian-Americans on both sides of the aisle, demonstrating that ABCD now stands for America-Born Confirmed Desis. While the Republicans have representation from Nikki Haley, Vivek Ramaswamy , and Usha Vance, Kamala Harris stands out on the Democrat side. The Biden Administration has also appointed numerous Indian-origin members, with Kash Patel emerging as the latest ABCD entrant, and Trump’s prospective pick for CIA chief.The Indian-origin American is considered the 'ultimate Trump loyalist' and previously played a key role in aiding Republicans’ efforts to discredit the Russia election interference probe. The former Republican House staffer has held senior positions within defence and intelligence during Trump’s prior administration.Several Trump allies have advocated for Patel’s appointment as the next CIA director. However, this role requires Senate confirmation—a process made easier after Republicans secured a majority on Tuesday. Should Senate approval not be forthcoming, Patel may be appointed as a member of the National Security Council.What makes Kash Patel’s views more compelling is his perspective on issues that markedly diverge from those of the US establishment and media. During the Ram Temple consecration, the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) expressed concerns, telling VOA they were “troubled” by the construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya. The New York Times described it as “A Triumph Toward a Hindu-First India,” and CNN reported, “Ayodhya Ram Mandir : India PM Modi inaugurates Hindu temple on razed Babri mosque site.” Patel accused Washington newspapers of only covering the past 50 years of history.He remarked to a leading daily in February: “To bring things really up to date, the opening of Ram’s Temple, when PM Modi went there, all the Washington newspapers only covered the last 50 years of history. They forgot the 500 preceding years. Whether or not you are Hindu or Muslim, there was a Hindu temple there for one of the quintessential gods in the Hindu pantheon in 1500 that was toppled, and they have been trying to get it back for 500 years.”He added: “But the Washington establishment forgot that part of history to put on what I believe is a disinformation campaign that’s harmful to India and the PM’s position. They’re using that because I think they liken Trump and Modi as similar figures, and the establishment class in Washington doesn’t want that to be the case.”In fact, Patel’s proposed ascendancy has an interesting side story. For those unfamiliar with Hindu mythology, a pivotal part in the Ramayana involves a squirrel. When Lord Rama’s army was building the bridge to Sri Lanka, a small squirrel, eager to help, began carrying tiny stones and dust to contribute. Lord Rama, noticing the squirrel's dedication, blessed it by stroking its back, leaving three white stripes as a symbol. In a recent twist, New York authorities caused outrage among MAGA supporters by euthanizing a pet squirrel named Peanut, and during Kamala Harris’s concession speech, a squirrel darted across the stage—sparking jests about divine intervention. On Diwali, Donald Trump condemned violence against Hindus in Bangladesh, pledging to protect Hindu-Americans from what he labelled the “radical left’s” anti-religion agenda. He highlighted his commitment to a “great partnership” with India and PM Modi, delivering a Diwali message aimed at a minority traditionally resistant to the Republican Party but showing increased openness to conservative support.Trump’s remarks resonated with concerns among Hindus about the neglect of Hindu minorities in Bangladesh. He also referenced California's contentious Senate Bill 403, intended to outlaw caste discrimination, which many Hindu-Americans see as unfairly targeting their community. Governor Gavin Newsom ultimately vetoed the bill, stating that existing laws sufficiently address caste discrimination, with rumours that VP Kamala Harris played a role to keep Hindu support within the Democratic Party. Trump’s praise for Modi, calling him both a friend and a “total killer” when necessary, aligns with his outreach to Hindu-Americans, contrasting with figures like US Ambassador Eric Garcetti, who has criticised India’s handling of recent diplomatic tensions with Canada.PM Narendra Modi was also one the first leaders who spoke to Trump after he won and the US President-elect called PM Modi a 'magnificent man' who was loved by 'the whole world'. Patel asserts Trump sees America as a global leader, not isolationist, with a commitment to securing American interests first and working closely with allies like India.Trump and Modi share mutual respect, Patel says, fostering a strong partnership focused on tackling shared threats, including terrorism and China’s regional influence.Patel claims Trump’s approach to China was more effective than Biden’s. Trump treated China as a serious threat, employing diplomatic, economic, and military measures to counter it and protect US interests.Patel describes Trump’s unpredictability as a strategic advantage, keeping adversaries off balance and deterring threats from countries like Iran and North Korea.Drawing from his immigrant background, Patel supports Trump’s strict stance on immigration, emphasising border security while maintaining lawful immigration to balance security and economic needs.Patel stresses the importance of US-India tech partnerships, especially in AI and quantum computing, which he views as crucial for national security. He criticises Biden for overlooking this partnership.Patel argues there’s a “two-tier justice system” biased against Trump and conservative views, alleging political agendas have overridden public service.Patel notes Trump’s emphasis on equitable contributions within NATO, asserting that allies should contribute fairly, a stance Patel claims challenged norms but promoted balanced alliances.Patel claims some US liberals’ criticism of Modi’s policies aims to create division, while Trump respects Modi’s governance, prioritising the broader US-India alliance over internal politics.Patel describes Trump as approachable and detail-oriented, suggesting his focus on personal connections has helped retain a loyal advisory team.",Kash Patel is considered the 'ultimate Trump loyalist' and previously played a key role in aiding Republicans’ efforts to discredit the Russia election interference probe.

It was a bad night for everyone who voted for him too. You just don't realize it yet,"" Jimmy Kimmel, who Trump has frequently tangled with, began somberly in a sketch on ABC that showed him packing up to leave the country.“It was a terrible night for women, for children, for the hundreds of thousands of hard working immigrants who make this country great, for health care, for our climate, for science, for journalism, for justice, for free speech,” he continued gravely, adding, ""It was a really good night for Putin and for polio and for lovable billionaires like Elon Musk, and the bros up in Silicon Valley, and all the wriggling brain worms who sold what was left of their souls to bow down to Donald Trump.""Stephen Colbert, his peer on Comedy Central, was as gutted, starting his monologue with a profanity, saying, ""Well, f***. It happened again.

""No, no. No one tells the guy who cleans the bathroom, 'Wow, you must love it when someone has explosive diarrhea — there’s so much material for you to work with!'"" he joked.He called Trump ""a monstrous child surrounded by cowards and grifters"" and took a swipe at Trump voters, saying, ""in this democracy the majority have spoken and said that they don't care about democracy.""NBC's Jimmy Fallon jibed that America has ""got back together with its crazy ex"" a theme that was also expressed by the Daily Show's Desi Lydic who lamented that “instead of breaking the glass ceiling, last night America decided to get back with her dirtbag ex.”Lydic also expressed the female perspective of what liberals see as a fiasco, joking, “Yep, it’s official. America elected its first criminal president before electing its first female president. What a day for proud felonists.”“We’ve had two qualified, accomplished women nominated for president, and both times they lost to the worst man in the whole country,"" she added.“Trump returning to the White House is a huge historic comeback for someone who literally never went away,” Fallon joked, adding, ""Trump could be the first president to be under White House arrest.”And from Kimmel: “Donald Trump is like the emperor from ‘Star Wars.’ He’s old, he’s evil and he keeps coming back with no reasonable explanation whatsoever.”Late night comedians, and indeed the mainstream liberal-leaning US media, has been largely anti-Trump, irking the former president, who has tried to promote pro-MAGA comedians.“Nancy Pelosi was so enraged by Trump’s victory, her eyebrows moved to Canada,” joked Greg Gutfield, a new Trump favorite. “He (Trump) won the popular vote by over 5 million. That can’t be explained away. The Dems can’t give their usual excuses, with more ‘but, but, buts’ than a Kardashian family reunion.” he added.Trump has frequently voiced resentment about jokes aimed at him, and according to one account, wondering with aides whether satire can be punished. He has had a particularly contentious relationship with Jimmy Kimmel, calling him ""mediocre"" and a ""loser.""Kimmel in turn has taunted him possible prison time, in one instance reading out a message Trump sent him when he was hosting the Academy Awards, and joking, “Thank you, President Trump. Thank you for watching. I’m surprised you’re still up...Isn’t it past your jail time?”More recently, Kimmel joked about Trump's visit to a McDonald's, jibing, ""This is a win-win for Trump...Because working a deep-fryer will give him a new skill he could potentially put to use in the prison cafeteria.”On Wednesday, he was more circumspect, joking, “My only request to President-elect Trump is that he let me share a prison cell with Taylor Swift.”","Late night comedians are crying foul as Donald Trump had the last laugh in the 2024 US Presidential elections.

'Nostradamus' Allan Licthman blames democracy after failure to predict Trump win,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nostradamus-allan-licthman-blames-democracy-after-failure-to-predict-trump-win/articleshow/115058858.cms,"Lichtman’s Prediction Shock



The “Keys to the White House” Model: A Look Inside



Concerns Over Democracy



A System Under Strain: Evaluating the Keys



Reflections on a Missed Prediction and the Changing Political Landscape



The Fragility of Democracy in the 21st Century

American historian Allan Lichtman, often called the "" Nostradamus of US elections,"" found himself at a loss for words when his prediction of Kamala Harris ’ victory in the 2024 US Presidential Elections proved incorrect. Lichtman and his son Sam hosted a six-hour YouTube livestream, during which he was seen saying, “I don’t get it,” as Donald Trump moved closer to clinching victory.Visibly fatigued, stressed, and disappointed by the election outcome, Lichtman commented, “Good thing I have nothing to do tomorrow. And I’m not doing any interviews.” He added, “The democracy is gone.” In related coverage, the battle in Nevada, North Carolina, and Arizona remains “too close to call.”Reflecting on the state of democracy, Lichtman observed, “Once democracy is gone, it’s almost impossible to recover. The way to recover is by dictators losing wars.” On 6 November, Republican candidate and former president Donald Trump secured a historic victory, surpassing the required majority to defeat Kamala Harris. Trump celebrated the result as a “magnificent victory for the American people,” thanking his supporters.“This is the first moment of the night where I’ve lost hope a little bit,” Sam Lichtman admitted as news outlets announced that battleground Pennsylvania had gone to Trump.In a separate statement, Canada’s pro-Khalistani leader Jagmeet Singh shared his concerns following Trump’s win.Lichtman, expressing dismay, remarked that he hoped Trump would serve his term and that “we never have to deal with him again.” He further shared his disbelief, stating, “I just can’t wrap my mind around how that many people can just ignore all the stuff he did in 2020,” describing Trump as “too lazy to govern the country.”Concluding his livestream, Lichtman urged, “Democracy is precious, but like all precious things, it can be destroyed. And typically destroyed from within. Throughout the 21st century, democracy has been in decline around the world, and America has now fallen in step. But never give up hope. Never stop striving. Never stop trying, especially you young people.”For over four decades, Lichtman has used his ""Keys to the White House "" model with striking accuracy, having correctly predicted every presidential winner since 1984. The 77-year-old American University professor believed that Harris would emerge victorious in the 2024 election, convinced by the model's indicators that pointed towards a Democratic win. However, as the results confirmed Trump’s landslide victory, Lichtman found himself caught off-guard, live-streaming his disbelief alongside his son, Sam. The political soothsayer was left pondering what went awry, even joking, “Good thing I’ve nothing on tomorrow. No interviews for me.”Lichtman’s prediction model, the ""13 Keys to the White House,"" is based on a set of 13 true-or-false factors designed to assess whether conditions favour the incumbent party. If six or more of these keys turn “false,” the model suggests a loss for the incumbent. The keys range from economic performance and social stability to candidate charisma and major policy accomplishments. Lichtman believed that Kamala Harris had eight keys in her favour, with Trump falling short by several indicators. According to this analysis, Harris should have had a clear path to victory.In his forecast, Lichtman highlighted Harris’s advantages under keys like “No Primary Contest,” “Strong Long-term Economy,” and “No Foreign or Military Failures.” These indicators typically benefit the incumbent party when stable or positive. However, despite these favourable predictions, the electorate appeared to move in an unexpected direction, leading to Trump’s decisive win. This miss by the ""Keys"" model highlights potential limitations when applied to an increasingly unpredictable political landscape.As the election results unfolded, Lichtman’s initial disbelief soon gave way to deeper concerns for the future of democracy. At one point during the live broadcast, he lamented, “Oh, democracy’s gone,” capturing his fears of an era marked by fragility in democratic institutions. This sentiment went beyond his failed prediction and reflected a broader apprehension about the future of democratic governance, particularly given Trump’s polarising leadership style and its impact on political norms.Lichtman expressed that once democracy is eroded, its restoration is often an uphill struggle. He referenced historical precedents where authoritarian rule only ended through significant upheaval, such as wars or social revolutions. His son, Sam, attempted to lift his spirits, optimistically noting that they might not need to worry about Trump’s influence post-presidency. Lichtman, however, remained unconvinced, warning that “Democracy is precious, but like all precious things, it can be destroyed.” He emphasised that the erosion of democratic norms globally, particularly in the 21st century, has been an alarming trend.Since its inception, Lichtman’s model has been heralded as a robust alternative to traditional polling, which often misses nuanced voter sentiment. Developed after analysing patterns in presidential elections from 1860 to 1980, the ""Keys to the White House"" model was intended to cut through polling noise and highlight the broader conditions that typically sway elections. Its 13 true/false statements each support or oppose the incumbent's chances, with “true” answers favouring the incumbent party. Key factors include the presence of a strong economy, absence of major scandals, and whether the challenger lacks charisma.Here’s a quick overview of some of the critical keys that Lichtman relied on:Party Mandate – Incumbents often benefit if they hold a strong congressional majority after midterms.No Primary Contest – Indicates a unified front, favouring the incumbent.Strong Long-term Economy – If the economy shows sustained growth, it usually supports the incumbent.No Social Unrest – A stable social environment boosts the incumbent’s chances.No Scandal – Absence of scandals preserves public trust.Uncharismatic Challenger – This key favours the incumbent if the challenger lacks charisma.For 2024, Lichtman assessed that Harris held the advantage with eight keys, signalling a stable foundation for a Democratic win. However, the actual outcome suggests that the political and social undercurrents at play were more complex than the model could capture.With Trump’s victory now certain, Lichtman’s rare miscalculation may underscore how shifting political dynamics have impacted the reliability of traditional forecasting. Modern elections increasingly feature unexpected variables, including the growing influence of disinformation, polarisation, and the changing nature of voter loyalty. Lichtman’s model, while historically insightful, may face new challenges in accounting for the electorate’s evolving motivations.Furthermore, the 2024 election was notable for a heightened emotional atmosphere, with strong divisions across party lines. Trump’s polarising yet powerful rhetoric appealed to a substantial portion of the American electorate, particularly those disillusioned by the status quo. While Harris was backed by indicators that should have tipped the scales, voter sentiment appeared to lean towards a familiar figure promising change, albeit in a more controversial manner.For Lichtman, the 2024 result symbolises more than a missed prediction. His remarks about democracy’s precarious state reflect a larger worry: that American democracy, like many others worldwide, faces unprecedented strain. The increasing polarisation, erosion of institutional norms, and rise of populism have altered the landscape. Lichtman fears these factors could destabilise the democratic framework if they continue unchecked.The historian’s warnings echo broader anxieties about the potential consequences of leadership that disregards traditional democratic values. Lichtman stressed the need for vigilance and resilience, urging those who cherish democratic principles not to lose hope. He reminded his audience that while democracy can be fragile, it can also be resilient—if people remain committed to protecting it.In the face of uncertainty, Lichtman’s insights remind us that, while no model is infallible, the continued pursuit of truth, transparency, and democratic values is indispensable. As he said, “Never give up hope.” It is a sentiment that transcends his prediction, offering a hopeful call to those committed to sustaining democracy in an unpredictable world.","American historian Allan Lichtman, often called the "" Nostradamus of US elections,"" found himself at a loss for words when his prediction of Kamala Harris’ victory in the 2024 US Presidential Elections proved incorrect.

What is Project 2025

?

What Donald Trump said on Project 2025?

Project 2025 resurfaced as the talking point after Donald Trump claimed victory in an election which was thought closer than a coin toss. Project 2025 was a 900-page policy wish list from which Donald Trump distanced himself as it was at the center of a major controversy for its conservation vision. Right-wing think tank The Heritage Foundation drafted Project 2025 and it was unveiled in April 2023. The Kamala Harris campaign resisted Project 2025 while the Republicans disavowed it.""Suddenly Trump will know all the details of Project 2025,"" a social media user posted.""So can we tell them that Project 2025 is real now,"" another said.""Can you believe we tricked the Libs into believing Project 2025 wasn't real??? Lmaoooo,"" another wrote.""Remember when we told the liberals that 'Trump isn’t even connected to project 2025'? We lied. Prepare yourselves,"" one post read.A new initiative, ""Project 2025,"" presents a series of policy proposals from conservative groups, outlining potential changes for a future Republican presidential administration. The project suggests significant restructuring within the federal government. One major proposal aims to increase presidential authority over the federal bureaucracy and the Department of Justice. Additionally, ""Project 2025"" advocates for the removal of the abortion pill mifepristone from the market.Increased funding for a wall on the US-Mexico border is proposed in the document.

The oldest person to be elected US President at 78, Donald Trump will have only four years in the White House thanks to the 22nd Amendment of the US Constitution that a President can only hold the office twice. Unless of course he decides to become a dictator for more than just one day, a desire he has expressed, seemingly in jest. On a more serious note, Trump has said win or lose he will not run for office again, which means he will cede the Oval Office in 2028 when he will be 82.Typical of the American political system, analysts are already eyeing potential successors in 2028, with all eyes on incoming vice-president JD Vance, who is only 40, and will become the highest-ranking member of the millennial generation in the US government. The challenge for Vance to step into Trump formidable shoes will not only come from other aspirants in the party, but also from Trump's own proclivity to entrust his children, including his daughter Ivanka, 43, and sons Donald Trump Jr, 46, and Eric Trump, 40, with political responsibility. Vance’s Indian-American wife, Usha Chilukuri, will now be the official Second Lady of the United States.Beyond family and political succession though, the most influential member of the Trump II inner circle is expected to be Elon Musk, the Tesla/SpaceX honcho who threw his mouth and moolah behind the MAGA Supremo to counter the liberal leanings of the legacy media. Already assured of a key role in the TrumpII administration, Musk -- was embedded with the MAGA Supremo in Mar-a-Lago as the results rolled in on Tuesday night -- will be a lodestar in an incoming dispensation that has pledged to cull government departments and expenditure in the name of efficiency. Although Musk posted a meme showing him bringing a kitchen sink into the Oval Office as Trump’s victory became imminent, he cannot run for President because he is not a US born citizen. But beyond the man behind the Resolute Desk, he is expected to be the most influential figure in the Trump II dispensation.With the MAGA Supremo’s disdain for the Washington elite now well-established (resulting in at least 40 members of his cabinet and inner circle being fired or forced to resign), there will be plenty of new faces in Trump II White House, including those who unquestioningly stood by him or kissed his ring after being defeated by him. Among them Vivek Ramaswamy, 39, the Indian-American bio-science entrepreneur who challenged Trump for the GOP nomination but folded quickly to become a camp follower. Two other Indian-Americans, Kash Patel and Shalli Kumar, stood rock solid behind Trump through all his trials and tribulations, and they will be looking for the spoils of office too.Former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the UN during Trump I, will also be looking to make a comeback after a late endorsement of Trump after critical comments about his campaign. Trump has also promised to let Robert Kennedy Jr, a man who has pushed crank science for decades, ""go wild"" with the health portfolio. Given that dozens of senior personnel in Trump I White House either resigned or were fired, there will be many new faces in Trump II, with everyone expected to toe the line in what will almost certainly be an imperial Presidency, a system endorsed by the US Supreme Court staffed by Trump during his first term.That will include the military commanders and the head of the US Federal Reserve and the Justice Department, who Trump expects to be pliable and follow the dictates of the White House. Having asserted that the President can do no wrong once – or anything he does is right since he has the mandate of the people once he is elected – Trump II is expected to be wild ride without guardrails.","Donald Trump will have only four years in the White House thanks to the 22nd Amendment of the US Constitution.

Susie Wiles, a veteran Republican strategist based in Florida, has managed several significant political campaigns . She led Trump’s Florida campaigns in both 2016 and 2020, and played a pivotal role in Ron DeSantis’ successful 2018 gubernatorial race.

based in Florida, has managed several significant . She led Trump’s Florida campaigns in both 2016 and 2020, and played a pivotal role in Ron DeSantis’ successful 2018 gubernatorial race. Wiles is the daughter of Pat Summerall, the renowned football player and sportscaster. Summerall played in the NFL for ten years and went on to announce 16 Super Bowls before his passing in 2013.

She worked alongside co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita, with orchestrating the most disciplined and sophisticated campaign of Trump’s three presidential runs.

Her previous successes also include steering Rick Scott’s 2010 campaign for Florida governor and a brief leadership role in Jon Huntsman’s 2012 presidential bid.

During the 1970s, she served in New York Representative Jack Kemp's Washington office. Subsequently, she took positions in Ronald Reagan's campaign and worked as a scheduler in his White House.

Later, she relocated to Florida, where she provided counsel to two Jacksonville mayors and worked alongside Representative Tillie Fowler.

Her career progressed into Florida's competitive political landscape, where she earned recognition for helping businessman Rick Scott secure the governorship.

Wiles earned widespread recognition both within and beyond Trump's close circle for orchestrating his most organised and effective campaign to date.

As the frontrunner for the position, she maintained a low profile, declining to speak during Trump's victory celebration in the early hours of Wednesday.

She strategically avoided the formal campaign manager title, considering Trump's previous history of making frequent changes in that role.

President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday appointed Susie Wiles , one of the two key campaign managers behind his election victory, as White House chief of staff . Wiles will make history as the first woman to serve in this role.This appointment marks the first in a series of expected staffing announcements as Trump prepares for his return to the White House on January 20.The US Vice President-elect JD Vance confirmed her selection. ""The 45th and 47th President of the United States of America Donald J. Trump announced today that Susan Summerall Wiles, the winning Campaign Manager for President Trump's highly successful 2024 Campaign for President, will be named President Trump's White House Chief of Staff,"" Vance wrote in a post on X.During the campaign, Wiles demonstrated exceptional ability in managing Trump's behaviour, achieving this through earned respect and demonstrating the benefits of following her guidance rather than disregarding it.""Susie is tough, smart, innovative, and is universally admired and respected. Susie will continue to work tirelessly to Make America Great Again,"" Trump said in a statement.""It is a well deserved honor to have Susie as the first-ever female Chief of Staff in United States history. I have no doubt that she will make our country proud,” he added.Trump's staff recognised Wiles' unique ability to work with his temperament and decision-making style whilst maintaining his authentic approach.During campaign events, Trump frequently acknowledged Wiles' contributions, highlighting what others had described to him as his ""best-run campaign.""""She's incredible. Incredible,"" he said at a Milwaukee rally earlier this month.Trump's first administration saw four chiefs of staff, including one serving in an acting capacity for a year, reflecting significant staff turnover. Several senior advisers were cast out in his first term, either due to Trump's resistance to management or because of ideological conflicts within the divided West Wing.This appointment represents Trump's initial significant decision as president-elect, potentially setting the tone for his incoming administration as he assembles the team to oversee federal government operations. Despite limited federal government experience, Wiles maintains a strong working relationship with the president-elect.The chief of staff position is ""absolutely critical to an effective White House,"" according to Chris Whipple, author of the book ""The Gatekeepers"", which examines how this role influences presidencies.""At the end of the day the most important thing is telling the president what he doesn't want to hear,” Whipple said.""On the plus side, she's shown that she can manage Trump, that she works with him and can sometimes tell him hard truths, and that's really important. On the minus side, she really has no White House experience and hasn't really worked in Washington in 40 years. And that's a real disadvantage,” he added.","Susie Wiles, a veteran Republican strategist based in Florida, has managed several significant political campaigns.

Judge allows Elon Musk’s $1 million-a-day sweepstakes amid accusations of election interference,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-presidential-elections/judge-allows-elon-musks-1-million-a-day-sweepstakes-amid-accusations-of-election-interference/articleshow/114961506.cms,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk at a rally

A Pennsylvania court has ruled that a high-profile $1 million-a-day sweepstakes, hosted by Elon Musk's America PAC in key swing states, can continue through the presidential election. The decision by Judge Angelo Foglietta on Monday comes after Musk’s lawyers argued that recipients of the sweepstakes are not chosen at random but rather selected based on alignment with the PAC’s values. Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, however, had attempted to halt the programme, describing it as a ""scam"" that breaches state election laws.The sweepstakes, designed to register over a million voters in battleground states, offers substantial payouts to selected participants who sign a petition supporting the First and Second Amendments. Musk’s lawyer, Chris Gober, defended the programme, explaining that recipients were not randomly picked but pre-screened to ensure they represent the PAC’s ideals. Gober confirmed that two more recipients would be named before Election Day, one in Arizona and another in Michigan.In response, Krasner’s legal team argued that the initiative is a thinly veiled attempt to sway the election. Testifying in court, America PAC director Chris Young admitted that recipients undergo personality assessments to determine if they fit the PAC's messaging and sign nondisclosure agreements to keep details of their selection process confidential. In past social media posts, however, Musk indicated that anyone signing the petition had a “chance” to win the daily $1 million prize, which Krasner's team pointed out contradicts claims that winners were not randomly selected.The sweepstakes also caught the attention of the US Justice Department, which recently issued a warning to Musk’s PAC over potential violations of federal election laws, specifically those that prohibit financial incentives tied to voter registration. This caution, reportedly sent by the department’s Public Integrity Section, has prompted America PAC to revise its messaging. Under new guidelines, recipients are now referred to as “spokespersons” rather than “winners,” a change some experts suggest does little to alter the sweepstakes' structure.Legal experts are divided on the issue. Some argue the programme exists in a legal “grey area,” potentially sidestepping direct violation of voter laws, while others contend it skirts dangerously close to illegal compensation for voter participation. Matthew Sanderson, a Republican election law expert, stated that while the programme raises legal questions, it does not necessarily break the law.The sweepstakes has already seen four winners from states like Pennsylvania and Michigan, all of whom publicly endorsed Trump and constitutional rights in promotional videos. America PAC has pledged that all prize funds will be disbursed by the end of November, although it remains unclear whether the recipients have received their winnings. Meanwhile, concerns linger over the PAC's potential long-term use of voter data from over a million registrants, which Krasner suggests may exploit participants beyond the election season.Elon Musk, who did not attend the court hearing, has already poured more than $70 million into the PAC, backing Trump’s campaign and other Republican candidates ahead of the election. Krasner hinted he may pursue civil damages for Pennsylvania residents who signed up for the sweepstakes, suggesting that Musk's operation misuses electoral integrity and infringes on the state’s lottery laws.","A Pennsylvania court has ruled that a high-profile $1 million-a-day sweepstakes, hosted by Elon Musk's America PAC, can continue through the presidential election.

Climbing Florida's political ladder



A Pragmatic approach to Trump’s leadership style



Challenges ahead in West Wing



US President-elect Donald Trump in a historic move appointed Susie Wiles as the first woman to serve as White House chief of staff. A veteran political strategist and key figure in Trump’s 2024 campaign, Wiles is widely known for her strategic expertise and her ability to navigate the complexities of Trump's political style.The selection was confirmed by Vice President-elect JD Vance , who described her as “the winning Campaign Manager for President Trump’s highly successful 2024 Campaign for President.”Wiles has deep roots in Republican politics, particularly in Florida, where she managed multiple successful campaigns. Known for steering Trump’s Florida efforts in both 2016 and 2020, she also contributed to the 2018 gubernatorial campaign of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis . Her political career began in the 1970s in Washington, working in the office of New York Representative Jack Kemp, followed by roles in Ronald Reagan’s campaign and administration. She later transitioned to Florida politics, where she helped Rick Scott secure the governorship in 2010.Trump praised her as “tough, smart, innovative, and universally admired,” adding, “It is a well-deserved honor to have Susie as the first-ever female Chief of Staff in United States history. I have no doubt that she will make our country proud.”Wiles’ success with Trump lies in her ability to balance his temperament while maintaining a disciplined campaign structure. She worked alongside co-manager Chris LaCivita to lead a more organised campaign than Trump’s previous runs. Known for her low-profile approach, Wiles avoided the spotlight, even refraining from speaking at Trump’s victory event.Her role as chief of staff will involve coordinating the president-elect’s agenda, managing personnel, and acting as a close advisor. “At the end of the day the most important thing is telling the president what he doesn't want to hear,” said Chris Whipple, author of The Gatekeepers. Whipple acknowledged her skill but noted her limited Washington experience as a possible disadvantage.Daughter of NFL legend Pat Summerall, launched her political career in Washington before establishing herself as a formidable strategist in Florida's high-stakes political landscape. She played a pivotal role in Rick Scott's successful 2010 gubernatorial bid and briefly worked on Jon Huntsman's 2012 presidential campaign.However, her relationship with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis grew tense, ultimately leading to a split. This division escalated during the 2024 primaries, where she led Donald Trump’s campaign against DeSantis.Wiles’ influence within Trump’s team reportedly fueled the campaign’s strategy, often using insider knowledge from her past work with DeSantis. After DeSantis suspended his presidential bid, Wiles posted a succinct farewell on social media: “Bye, bye.”Throughout the campaign, Trump’s aides, emboldened by Wiles’ insights, seized opportunities to mock DeSantis, targeting everything from his mannerisms to his footwear.Wiles’ pragmatic approach earned her Trump’s respect, allowing her to guide him without lecturing or reprimanding. During a widely criticised speech in Pennsylvania, Wiles reportedly managed to communicate disapproval by standing nearby and staring in silence depicting her unique approach to managing Trump’s behaviour. Trump has publicly acknowledged her contributions, describing her leadership as “incredible” and calling her campaign management his “best-run campaign.”Wiles’ appointment signals a potential shift from Trump’s first term, where he experienced high turnover in the chief of staff role. Trump has remarked that he feels more prepared for his second term, having learned from past personnel decisions. While Wiles’ ability to balance discipline and Trump’s dynamic style has been effective, only time will tell if her role will bring more stability to the administration as she steps into one of the most demanding jobs in Washington.","US President-elect Donald Trump appoints Susie Wiles as White House chief of staff.

Qatar asks Hamas officials to leave country following pressure from US: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/qatar-asks-hamas-officials-to-leave-country-following-pressure-from-us-report/articleshow/115102026.cms,"Qatar has instructed Hamas leaders to leave the country following a US request to end Qatar’s support for the group, a source told Reuters.In a series of high-stakes communications, Washington has informed Qatar that Hamas's continued presence in Doha is no longer acceptable following the militant group’s rejection of recent ceasefire and hostage exchange proposals, prompting Qatar to deliver a similar message to Hamas leaders around ten days ago.A US official, highlighting the US stance, told Reuters, “After rejecting repeated proposals to release hostages, its leaders should no longer be welcome in the capitals of any American partner. We made that clear to Qatar following Hamas's rejection weeks ago.”Despite the US urging, three Hamas officials have denied that Qatar formally demanded they leave.Since 2012, Qatar has housed Hamas’ political leaders as part of an agreement to facilitate negotiations, particularly during periods of intense conflict between Hamas and Israel. In recent months, Qatar, alongside the US and Egypt, has spearheaded several rounds of negotiations to end the violence in Gaza—a goal that has proved elusive as Hamas rejected a recent ceasefire offer in mid-October.The Biden administration’s push for a resolution in Gaza has gained urgency as Israel’s retaliatory strikes have devastated Gaza, leaving an estimated 43,000 Palestinians dead and causing widespread destruction. Meanwhile, the recent election of Republican Donald Trump as the next US president has reportedly limited President Biden’s leverage in these final weeks of his administration.Previous rounds of talks saw plans fall apart as Israel introduced new stipulations, including a potential military presence in Gaza, which Hamas viewed as shifting “last-minute goalposts."" Last year, similar talks mediated in Doha led to a temporary seven-day truce in Gaza, allowing the release of hostages and the inflow of humanitarian aid, but hostilities quickly resumed.Qatar’s long-standing role as a mediator has increasingly come under fire from US lawmakers. Fourteen Republican senators recently penned a letter to the Department of State urging sanctions on Hamas officials residing in Qatar, calls for their extradition, and a demand for Qatar to “end its hospitality” towards Hamas.Qatar’s Prime Minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, has defended the country’s hosting of Hamas officials, stating that their presence facilitates essential diplomatic negotiations.","Qatar has housed Hamas' political leaders since 2012 to facilitate negotiations.

Who is Susie Wiles?



A Disciplined Campaign Leader



Roots in Party Establishment



Working with Trump’s Rivals



The 'Ice Maiden'



Reince Priebus (January 20, 2017 – July 31, 2017):

John F. Kelly (July 31, 2017 – January 2, 2019)

Mick Mulvaney (Acting, January 2, 2019 – March 31, 2020):

Mark Meadows (March 31, 2020 – January 20, 2021):

In a swift move following his win over Kamala Harris, President-elect Donald Trump has named Susie Wiles , his campaign chief, as White House Chief of Staff. Wiles, a seasoned Republican strategist and key figure in Trump’s campaign machinery, will now oversee daily White House operations , marking a new chapter in her long political career.Following his victory over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, Republican President-elect Donald Trump has appointed Susie Wiles, his campaign chief, as his White House Chief of Staff. This marks Trump’s first major appointment post-election. Here’s a closer look at key facts about Wiles, who will be overseeing daily operations at the White House.A seasoned Republican strategist, Wiles, alongside co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita, is credited with leading one of Trump’s most structured and disciplined campaigns. While it wasn’t always possible to keep Trump on-script, she managed to minimise leaks, crafted an effective strategy to appeal to Latino and Black voters, and ultimately helped secure a decisive win.Wiles began her political career on Ronald Reagan’s 1980 presidential campaign and has since worked with moderate Republicans. Her experience includes roles with figures like Jack Kemp, a free-trade advocate, and Tillie Fowler, known for moderate positions on issues like gun control. She also managed Jon Huntsman Jr.’s 2012 presidential campaign, supporting a candidate known for his moderate stance and criticism of Trump following the Capitol attack on January 6th.In later years, Wiles collaborated with several high-profile Republicans, including Trump ally Senator Rick Scott. She played a key role in Ron DeSantis’s successful 2018 campaign for Florida governor but was later dismissed by DeSantis after his election. When DeSantis entered the Republican primary against Trump, Wiles spearheaded an assertive strategy that highlighted DeSantis’s perceived weaknesses.Known for her restrained and enigmatic demeanour, Wiles rarely appears in televised interviews or public speaking events, contrasting with the more vocal Chris LaCivita. Trump even referred to her as the ""ice maiden"" during his victory speech, acknowledging her disciplined and sometimes ruthless approach to campaign management.Here’s a look at Trump’s former Chiefs of Staff and their perspectives on his leadership:Trump’s first Chief of Staff, Priebus maintained a low profile after his tenure, offering little public commentary on Trump’s style or approach to governing.: A former Marine Corps General, Kelly has been openly critical, describing Trump in stark terms and voicing concerns about how he might govern if given another term.Mulvaney has presented a balanced view, acknowledging both positives and negatives in Trump’s administration. While he has expressed concerns about certain decisions, he has been more reserved in his criticism than some other former officials.Meadows has remained a strong ally of Trump, consistently supporting his actions both during and after his presidency. Despite facing scrutiny over his involvement in January 6-related events, Meadows continues to align with Trump’s political direction.","Susie Wiles is a seasoned Republican strategist and key figure in Trump’s campaign machinery.

Vivian Jenna Wilson's fresh rant against estranged father Elon Musk.

As Elon Musk reacted to a news story of his estranged daughter Vivian Jenna Wilson deciding to leave the US seeing no future in the second Trump administration -- his father is a part of that -- Vivian unleashed a scathing attack on her father and called him a delusional, grubby, little control freak who hasn't matured for 38 years.Elon Musk wrote ""the woke mind virus killed my son"" to a user who claimed Vivian is not Elon Musk's daughter but son. Wilson saw the post and went on a rant on Threads.""If I'm correct, the reason why this particular post is the one that got to you is that you're mad that you finally don't have power over someone. You're upset because at the end of the day everyone around you knows you as a delusional and grubby little control freak who hasn't matured as a person for 38 years. However, last time I checked that's not my fucking problem,"" Wilson said.""So, you're still going with the sob-story about how ""woe is me, my child was infected by something-or-other and that's totally the only reason why they hate me.

Musk said Xavier was born gay and autistic, a claim which Wilson dismissed as a lie.Wilson came to the news after she said she, as a transgender, has no future in the US. It was ironic as Elon Musk played a crucial role in Donald Trump's win and was there at Trump family photo with his four-year-old son X.","Vivian Jenna Wilson, Elon Musk's estranged daughter, is leaving the US.

He described being approached by an IRGC official in September about organising Trump's assassination.When Shakeri mentioned the ""huge"" cost, the official responded: ""Money's not an issue."" By October 7, he received a seven-day deadline for the plan.
