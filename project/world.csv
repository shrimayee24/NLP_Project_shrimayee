A white Skoda Fabia car bearing registration number stopped next to their vehicle.There were five men - Nasir Hyder alias Nasir, Shafeeq Ahammed alias Shafiq, Shoyeb alias Shaikh Kalfan, Mohammed Hafeez alias Hafiz and Mohammed Ishq Soudh alias Soudh — in the car. They told Trisha to get out of her car.Trisha tried to run but was caught by the men and forcibly made to sit in the rear seat of their car. They even bundled Ranjith onto the rear seat. The car traversed various roads for an hour, during which Nasir started sexually harassing Trisha.At last, they stopped the car on the side of a railway track. Ranjith was taken out of the vehicle by others, while Nasir raped Trisha after threatening to kill her friend if she didn't cooperate. The ordeal went on for 15 minutes. Later, the gang released both of them.After learning about the sexual abuse of Trisha, her friends started searching for the miscreants' car in Pulakeshinagar. On July 12 of that year, they found the vehicle near a gym on MM Road.After waiting for hours, they managed to catch a man who came to take the car and took him to the police station.The same night, Trisha went to Pulakeshinagar police station to lodge a complaint of kidnap, sexual assault and molestation. The police officers dictated her complaint and made mention of only molestation.The matter reached then police commissioner Raghavendra Auradkar, who suspended Pulikeshinagar police inspector Mohammed Raffi.Later, police took a fresh statement from the girl and invoked appropriate sections of the law. The investigation was assigned to then ACP (Pulakeshinagar) Noorulla Shariff.He arrested all five assailants — Nasir, Shafiq, Shoyeb alias Shaikh Kalfan, Mohammed Hafeez alias Hafiz, and Mohammed Ishq Soudh alias Soudh.Ranjith told TOI, ""Trisha stood strong even though her parents panicked. She got a call asking her to withdraw the complaint and she changed her number. Even I got calls and was pressured to get her to withdraw the complaint. She did not relent."" Trisha is now working for a private firm.Public prosecutor Savitha D Ratan said the collection and matching of DNA samples played a crucial role in securing the convictions.The case was meandering till 2022 as only eight witnesses had deposed till then.

Student sets self afire amid Uttarakhand stir,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/student-sets-self-afire-amid-uttarakhand-stir/articleshow/114707730.cms,"Almora/Dehradun: A 23-year-old MSc student from Almora’s Soban Singh Jeena (SSJ) University set himself on fire on Monday as part of ongoing protests against the state govt’s decision to cancel student union elections in colleges and universities this year.Deepak Lohani , a candidate for the president’s post in the student union at the university, sustained 15% burns, primarily on his hands, stomach, and chest, said doctors.The incident occurred during a protest at Chaughanpata, where Rahul Dhami, the university’s current student union president poured petrol on himself. As police tried to de-escalate the situation, Lohani, also a member of the same students’s group, set himself on fire after dousing himself with petrol. Police quickly extinguished the flames and rushed Lohani to the district hospital, where he is currently receiving treatment.The issue of students’ elections has been simmering for almost a month ever since the deadline given by the state govt to universities for conducting the elections passed. The govt had issued an academic calendar on April 23, directing that student union elections be conducted by Sept 30. However, some of the university administrations failed to organise the elections within the specified time. The matter reached the Uttarakhand high court (HC) where a PIL was filed requesting the HC to intervene in getting the student union elections to be held. However, the PIL was dismissed on Oct 24 after the HC accepted the state govt’s contention that it is too late into the academic session to hold the elections.In Almora, student organisations had given the call for a protest rally in the Chaughanpata area where they intended to burn effigies of state education minister Dhan Singh Rawat. This came as Amit Bisht, an NSUI member, announced on Saturday that he would self-immolate if demands were not met by Monday. The protest quickly escalated, leading to Dhami and Lohani’s self-immolation attempts. They warned the govt “not to test their patience” and vowed to keep fighting saying they will “force the state to yield”.Dhan Singh Rawat said, “We have sought response from the universities. A double bench of the HC had passed the order to not go against the recommendations of the Lyngdoh Committee, which says that student union elections should be held between six to eight weeks after a new academic session starts. Now the students may approach Supreme Court to challenge the HC’s order because universities cannot go against it or the Lyngdoh Committee.”Meanwhile, students from other districts also converged in Dehradun on Monday and marched from Congress Bhawan in the state capital to the secretariat. Another group of students from colleges in Dehradun also held a “funeral march” for Rawat by taking out a procession from DAV college to the secretariat.Students said that the last polls were also held after a two-month delay, making the decision to cancel it this year an “undemocratic move”.“If the admissions were postponed and the last admission was conducted till Sept 25, then preparation should have been made to postpone the elections too,” said Pradeep Singh Tomar, national coordinator (Uttarakhand), NSUI. Earlier, on Oct 18, angry over the college’s failure to announce the date for student union elections, three students from Haldwani’s Moti Ram Babu Ram Government Post Graduate College had climbed on the roof of the principal’s office and threatened self-immolation after pouring diesel on themselves. Later, the students issued an apology for their act.Elsewhere in Dehradun, students have set up tents outside DAV College and Dayanand Brijendra Swarup College, where they have been camping since Friday. Several colleges in the district have also been forced to shut down due to the agitation.","Deepak Lohani, a candidate for the president’s post in the student union at the university, sustained 15% burns, primarily on his hands, stomach, and chest.

Biden's victory was officially certified early the following day.Congress has since passed the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act of 2022, which requires approval of one-fifth of the House and Senate to consider a challenge to a state's results - a much higher bar than existed before when any single lawmaker from each chamber could trigger a challenge.","It could take days for the election result to be known, especially if it is closed and mail-in ballots are a factor.

‘Modi can influence the end of war’: Zelenskyy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/modi-can-influence-the-end-of-war-zelenskyy/articleshow/114667946.cms,"Zelensky Questions BRICS Unity After Summit Boosts Vladimir Putin’s Image Amid Ongoing Conflict

“PM Modi can influence the end of the Ukraine war . This is the huge value of him in any conflict. This is the huge value of India,” said Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in an exclusive interview to the Times of India. When asked about the possibility of PM Modi holding negotiations between Ukraine and Russia , Zelenskyy gave his strongest signal yet, “Undoubtedly it can be in India and PM Modi can really do that… but I think we need to prepare ourselves … and only according to our format because the war is in our land… we have the platform which is the peace summit.”Ukrainian forces have been under pressure in recent months with Russia making advances in the Donbas region. Add to this the uncertainty posed by the upcoming presidential elections in US where a Trump victory might see Kyiv lose vital American support. Washington is Kyiv’s biggest source of military aid and any cut in this support will be a huge setback for Ukraine. Kyiv already faces restrictions in using American supplied long-range weapons to hit Russian military targets deep inside Russia. With winter coming and Russia continuing to hit Ukrainian energy infrastructure, Kyiv is looking at another bleak few months.“This is the third hard winter for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people… We are step-by-step strengthening our energy systems and aren’t just going to allow Russia to kill our people,” said Zelenskyy. Asked about his recently revealed Victory Plan and Nato membership for Ukraine, Zelenskyy emphasised that it was a bid to strengthen Ukraine as a bridge to peace negotiations to end the war. “The Victory Plan is not a bargaining chip or a topic of negotiations with Russia… We are not asking for quick Nato membership because that is not possible during the war … What we are asking for is invitation to Nato so that in the future nobody can change their opinion.”Zelenskyy was also critical about the recent Brics summit in Russia calling it a failure and citing the absence of some countries at the leaders’ level including those from Saudi Arabia and Brazil. “Putin wants to divide the world into so-called West-plus and Brics-plus… Even the (peace) proposals of Brazil and China were not acceptable to him… This was a slap for China and Brazil.”On Modi’s statement that he is ready to work to bring peace in Ukraine, Zelenskyy called for action, not mere words. “Modi is the PM of a really huge country… Such a country cannot just say we are interested in the end of the war… PM Modi can influence the end of the war… blocking of Russian economy, blocking of cheap energy resource, blocking of defence-industrial complex of Russia will lead to the decrease in capacity of Moscow to wage wars against us.”Specifically, Zelenskyy asked Modi for help to bring back Ukrainian children forcibly deported to Russia, “You can force Putin to bring back Ukrainian children… PM Modi can use his influence and tell Putin just give me 1,000 Ukrainian children who will be brought back to Ukraine. Let PM Modi bring back at least 1,000 Ukrainian children.”",Ukrainian forces have been under pressure in recent months with Russia making advances in the Donbas region.

We just told all the family secrets.”The vice president’s visit to the popular bar came on the first day of early in-person voting in Michigan, as over 1.4 million ballots had already been submitted.

""I want to have whatever she's having,"" Harris declared, raising her glass in a toast with Whitmer, who proudly shared the origins of the Oberon beer: “It's made right here in Kalamazoo, which many are calling Kamalazoo. Okay. Cheers.”Earlier that day, Harris had visited a doctor's office in nearby Portage, where she discussed the impacts of restrictive abortion laws with health care providers and students. “We are looking at a health care crisis in America that is affecting people of every background and gender,"" she noted, emphasising the urgent need for support in reproductive health care.The event with Harris and Obama was designed to energise the Democratic base as the party seeks to overcome challenges posed by a close race against Republican nominee Donald Trump. Despite a high-profile campaign featuring celebrities like Beyoncé and Bruce Springsteen, Harris faces the daunting task of converting star power into votes. Trump, during a rally, mocked her approach, stating, “Kamala is at a dance party with Beyoncé,” as he campaigned in Michigan.As the election season heats up, President Joe Biden, also active on the campaign trail, talked about Harris's dedication to labour rights, saying she once walked a picket line with the United Auto Workers.

They shared the original image of a McDonald's staff which they claimed had been manipulated to put Kamala Harris' face.Working at McDonald's emerged as a key flashpoint between the GOP and the Democrats as Donald Trump claimed Kamala Harris lied about working at McDonald's 41 years ago. To emulate her 'false claim', Donald Trump last Sunday worked a shift at a McDonald's outlet in Pennsylvania and said he worked 15 minutes more than Kamala Harris because Kamala Harris never worked at any McDonald's -- as there is no record of it.“We have checked with McDonald’s, and they say, definitively, that there is no record of Lyin’ Kamala Harris ever having worked there,” Trump wrote after his McDonald's shift. “In other words, she never worked there, and has lied about this ‘job’ for years.”Kamala Harris said she worked at a Bay Area McDonald's 41 years ago when she was in college in the summer of 1983. But the Trump campaign claimed that there has been no record of Kamala Harris working at McDonald's she claimed and hence she lied. But reports said it was a pre-digital era and no record found may not hint at 'never worked'.McDonald's said it is true that no records of Harris' employment exist but this is not an aberration and not a reason to think that she didn't work at a McDonald's. ""Though we are not a political brand, we’ve been proud to hear former President Trump’s love for McDonald’s and Vice President Harris’s fond memories working under the Arches. While we and our franchisees don’t have records for all positions dating back to the early ’80s, what makes ‘1 in 8’ so powerful is the shared experience so many Americans have had.""",Kamala Harris said she worked at a Bay Area McDonald's 41 years ago when she was in college in the summer of 1983.

TOI CORRESPONDENT FROM WASHINGTON:

It was meant to be funny. Instead, it could turn out to be a serious mistake. Throwaway lines by a comedian who labeled Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage,” at Trump rally , bookended by other speakers calling Kamala Harris a ""devil"" and suggesting she began her career as a prostitute, has exploded across US political spectrum with just about a week to go before Election Day on November 5.At a packed rally in Madison Square Gardens (MSG) in New York City which critics said had echoes of a Nazi rally in 1939, speaker after speaker excoriated Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party, minorities, and immigrants in disparaging and derogatory terms to an extent even moderate Republicans reeled back.Few were more toxic and coarse than Tony Hinchcliffe , a little-known comedian, whose ""humorous"" riff included the following lines: “I don’t know if you guys know this, but there’s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. I think it’s called Puerto Rico.” He then went on to say, “These Latinos, they love making babies, too.....There’s no pulling out. They don’t do that. They come inside, just like they did to our country.”Among speakers who preceded Trump's address to his MAGA faithful, his childhood friend David Rem referred to Kamala Harris as “the Antichrist” and “the devil,” and Businessman Grant Cardone told the crowd that Harris ”and her pimp handlers will destroy our country.” Other speakers called for metaphorically ""slaughtering"" political opponents, while Trump himself spoke of an ally ""decapitate"" a fake reporter on a tv show.The slurs caused outrage among many Latinos, minorities, and women even as a panicked Trump campaign said Hinchcliffe's joke “does not reflect the views of President Trump."" Prominent Latinos of Puerto Rican heritage, including superstar Bad Bunny , one of the biggest recording artists in the world, singer Ricky Martin, and actress Jennifer Lopez among others shared videos expressing supporting Kamala Harris even as MAGA Republicans running for office in areas with Latino voters quickly dissociated themselves from the smears.""This joke bombed for a reason. It's not funny and it's not true. Puerto Ricans are amazing people and amazing Americans!"" said Rick Scott, a Trump acolyte who is running to retain the senate seat in Florida, which has a large Latino and Puerto Rican population. ""This is not a joke. It’s completely classless & in poor taste. Puerto Rico is the crown jewel of the Caribbean & home to many of the most patriotic Americans I know,"" said Carlos Giminez, a Cuban-American lawmaker also running to retain his seat in Congress.The timing of the smear could not have been worse for MAGA candidates, coming just hours after Kamala Harris wrapped up a campaign to court Latinos in Pennsylvania by visiting a local Puerto Rican restaurant in Philadelphia. She talked about a new plan she announced on Sunday to bring economic opportunities to Puerto Rico, discussed her visit there after Hurricane Maria, and said that even as a senator she had “felt a need and an obligation” to “make sure Puerto Rico’s needs were met,” reminding them that as president,Trump had resisted sending aid to the island after back-to-back hurricanes, and had offered nothing but “paper towels and insults.”Puerto Rico, a Caribbean island, is unincorporated US territory, and although it is not technically an American state, Puerto Ricans are considered US citizens and can vote in US elections if they are registered in the mainland (but not on the island). Since 2017, there has been an exodus of Puerto Ricans from the island, and they constitute significant voting blocs in Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina -- all battleground states -- and Florida.","Comedian Tony Hinchcliffe called Puerto Rico a ""floating island of garbage"" at Trump rally.

Elon Musk Giveaway: Philadelphia Prosecutor Sues Musk's PAC Over $1M Voter Incentive Ahead of Election,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/philadelphia-prosecutor-sues-musks-pac-over-1m-voter-giveaway-ahead-of-election/articleshow/114703103.cms,"Elon Musk (Pic credit: AP)

The Philadelphia district attorney 's office filed a lawsuit on Monday to prevent a political action committee led by billionaire Elon Musk from giving $1 million to registered US voters in key battleground states before the November 5 election .The complaint, filed by the top prosecutor in the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas, alleged that the giveaway by Musk's America PAC , which supports Republican former President Donald Trump , constituted an ""illegal lottery"" that encouraged Pennsylvania residents to disclose personal information.Lawrence Krasner, the chief prosecutor in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania's largest city and a Democratic stronghold, claimed that the giveaways violated state consumer protection laws. ""If not enjoined, their lottery scheme will irreparably harm Philadelphians – and others in Pennsylvanians – and tarnish the public's right to a free and fair election,"" the complaint read.In response to a request for comment, an America PAC spokesperson provided a link to the group's latest post on X, published after news of the lawsuit broke. The post revealed a Michigan resident as the recipient of the $1 million prize and stated that additional awards would be distributed daily until the election.Pennsylvania is one of seven crucial battleground states that will determine the outcome of the presidential election between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris , a Democrat. The candidate who secures the state's 19 electoral votes out of the 270 needed to win will emerge victorious.According to a CNN report last week, the Justice Department has sent a letter to America PAC cautioning that the billionaire Tesla CEO's giveaways for registered voters who sign his free-speech and gun-rights petition may violate federal law.Legal experts consulted by Reuters last week had differing opinions on whether the giveaway violates federal laws that criminalise paying or offering to pay someone to register to vote.The Trump campaign heavily relies on outside groups for voter canvassing, which means that the super PAC established by Musk, the world's wealthiest individual, plays a significant role in what is anticipated to be an extremely close election.","Philadelphia district attorney's office filed a lawsuit on Monday to prevent a political action committee led by billionaire Elon Musk from giving $1 million to registered voters.

'Enemy understands strength'



WASHINGTON: North Korea has sent some 10,000 troops to train in Russia , Washington said Monday, tripling its estimate and prompting Nato as well as EU warnings of a dangerous expansion of the Ukraine war .Pyongyang -- with whom Moscow signed a mutual defense pact -- is already widely believed to be arming Russia for its invasion, but troops on the ground would mark a new escalation in the conflict.Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned North Korea could ""soon"" have as many as 12,000 soldiers on Russian soil, while US President Joe Biden slammed the deployment as ""very dangerous.""""We believe that the DPRK has sent around 10,000 soldiers in total to train in eastern Russia that will probably augment Russian forces near Ukraine over the next several weeks,"" Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told journalists, using an abbreviation for North Korea's official name.Washington had previously put the number of North Korean troops in Russia at more than 3,000.Nato chief Mark Rutte likewise called the troop deployment ""a dangerous expansion of Russia's war"" and ""a sign of Putin's growing desperation.""Rutte noted more than 600,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded since the conflict started in 2022, adding the Kremlin was unable to sustain the invasion without foreign support.Despite the cost, Russia has been making steady territorial gains in Ukraine.Moscow's army has advanced 478 square kilometers (184 square miles) into Ukrainian territory since the beginning of October, a record since the first weeks of the war, according to an AFP analysis of data from the Institute for the Study of War.Those gains followed 477 and 459 square-kilometer advances in August and September, respectively, and come amid amid major shifts on the front line, in particular in eastern Ukraine around Pokrovsk.Speaking in Brussels after a briefing with South Korean intelligence officials, Rutte said he could confirm that North Korean military units had been deployed in the field in Russia's western Kursk region.Ukrainian troops launched a ground offensive in Kursk in August and control several hundred square kilometers of Russian territory.""The deepening military cooperation between Russia and North Korea is a threat to both the Indo-Pacific and Euro-Atlantic security,"" Rutte told reporters in Brussels.Experts have said that in return for the troops, North Korea is likely aiming to acquire military technology, ranging from surveillance satellites to submarines, plus possible security guarantees from Moscow.EU chief Ursula von der Leyen also warned that North Korea sending troops ""for the first time"" represented ""a significant escalation of the war against Ukraine and threatens global peace.""She made the comments after a phone call with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, during which she assured the leader that ""the EU's response to this development will center on cooperation with the Republic of Korea and other like-minded partners.""The United States likewise told China -- an ally of both Moscow and Pyongyang -- it should be ""concerned about this destabilizing action by two of its neighbors, Russia and North Korea,"" State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters.Rutte, a former Dutch prime minister who took over the reins of Nato this month, called on Moscow and Pyongyang to ""cease these actions immediately.""At a press conference in Iceland on Monday, Zelenskyy had warned that there were already around 3,000 North Korean soldiers on Russian land -- with four times that expected imminently.""We think that they will have 12,000 soon,"" the Ukrainian leader added.""This is an escalation. Sanctions alone are not enough. We need weapons and a clear plan to prevent North Korea's expanded involvement in the war in Europe,"" Zelenskyy 's chief of staff Andriy Yermak said on social media Monday after Rutte's comments.""Today, Russia brings in North Korea; next, it could broaden their engagement, and then other autocratic regimes may see that they can get away with this and come to fight against Nato ,"" he warned.""The enemy understands strength.

He contrasted this with Kamala, who he claimed took days off during the campaign, alleging, ""she's taking a day off.

The US Supreme Court received a request from Republicans on Monday for an emergency order in Pennsylvania that could potentially lead to the exclusion of thousands of votes in the upcoming election in this crucial swing state .The court is being asked to intervene in a dispute regarding provisional ballots cast by Pennsylvania voters whose mail ballots are disqualified for not adhering to technical procedures outlined in state law, just over a week before the election.In a 4-3 decision, the state's high court ruled that elections officials are required to count provisional ballots cast by voters whose mail-in ballots were invalidated because they were received without the mandatory secrecy envelopes.On the same day, Virginia also sought the Supreme Court's intervention in a dispute concerning the purging of voter registrations . The high court had previously weighed in on pandemic-related changes to voting rules in several states, including Pennsylvania, four years ago.Republicans, in their filing to the high court, requested an order to either put the state court ruling on hold or, alternatively, to require the segregation of provisional ballots and exclude them from the official vote count while the legal battle continues.

Authorities on Monday were investigating incidents of early morning fires destroying hundreds of ballots in ballot drop boxes in Portland , Oregon, and Vancouver , Washington.According to the Portland police bureau, officers and firefighters responded to a fire in a ballot drop box around 3:30 am and determined that an incendiary device had been placed inside.Tim Scott, the Multnomah County elections director, said that a fire suppressant inside the drop box protected nearly all the ballots, with only three being damaged. His office planned to contact those voters to assist them in obtaining replacement ballots.Later, in Vancouver, located across the Columbia River, television crews captured footage of smoke pouring out of a ballot box at a transit centre.Vancouver is the largest city in Washington's 3rd Congressional District, which is expected to have one of the closest US House races in the country between first-term Democratic Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez and Republican challenger Joe Kent.Greg Kimsey, the Clark County auditor in Vancouver, told The Associated Press that the ballot drop box at the Fisher's Landing Transit Center also had a fire suppression system inside, but for some reason, it wasn't effective. Responders pulled a burning pile of ballots from inside the box, and Kimsey said hundreds were lost. ""Heartbreaking,"" Kimsey said. ""It's a direct attack on democracy.""Surveillance cameras covered the drop box and surrounding area, according to Kimsey. The last ballot pickup at the transit centre drop box was at 11 am Saturday, and anyone who dropped their ballot thereafter that was urged to contact the auditor's office to obtain a new one.Kimsey said the office will be increasing the frequency of ballot collections and changing collection times to the evening to prevent ballot boxes from remaining full overnight when similar crimes are considered more likely to occur.On October 8, an incendiary device was also found on or near a ballot drop box in downtown Vancouver. It did not damage the box or destroy any ballots, according to police. The FBI and other agencies had been investigating.Both Washington and Oregon are vote-by-mail states, where registered voters receive their ballots in the mail a few weeks before elections and then return them by mail or by placing them in ballot drop boxes.Last week in Phoenix, officials reported that approximately five ballots were destroyed and others damaged when a fire was set in a drop box at a US Postal Service station.","Firefighters responded to a fire in a ballot drop box in Portland, Oregon.

Pakistan begins another vaccination campaign after a worrying surge in polio cases,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-begins-another-vaccination-campaign-after-a-worrying-surge-in-polio-cases/articleshow/114682461.cms,"(AP photo)

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan began a nationwide vaccination campaign Monday to protect 45 million children from polio after a surge in new cases that has hampered years of efforts to stop the disease in one of the two countries where it has never been eradicated.Pakistan regularly launches such campaigns, but violence targeting the health workers and police assigned to escort them is common. Militants falsely claim the vaccination campaigns are a Western conspiracy to sterilize children.The campaign is the third this year and will continue until Sunday ""in response to the alarming increase in polio cases,"" said Ayesha Raza Farooq , the prime minister's adviser for the polio eradication program. ""We are re-energized in our efforts to combat polio,"" she said in a statement.During the door-to-door campaign, children younger than 5 will be vaccinated and given drops of Vitamin A supplements to enhance their immunity.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif recently met with front-line health workers, urging them to ensure no child was left unvaccinated by going door-to-door.Anwarul Haq, who is the coordinator of the National Emergency Operations Centre for Polio Eradication, also urged parents to fully cooperate with polio workers. ""Polio has no cure, but it can be prevented with this readily available vaccine,"" he said.Pakistan has recorded 41 cases across 71 districts so far this year, Farooq said. Most were reported from southwestern Balochistan and southern Sindh province, following by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and eastern Punjab province.The surge in cases in new locations is worrying authorities since previous cases were from the restive northwest bordering Afghanistan, where the Taliban government in September suddenly stopped a door-to-door vaccination campaign.Authorities in Pakistan say the Afghan Taliban's recent decision to stop door-to-door anti-polio campaign will have repercussions beyond the Afghan border, as people from both sides frequently travel to each other's country. The World Health Organization has confirmed 18 polio cases in Afghanistan this year.Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only two countries in the world where the spread of polio has never been stopped.
