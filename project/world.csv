NAGPUR: Quoting a Supreme Court ruling, Nagpur bench of Bombay high court has said the use of loudspeakers is not essential to practising a religion, and that amplified sound cannot infringe on the rights of unwilling listeners. Dismissing a plea by Masjid Gousiya in Maharashtra’s Gondia district, seeking a directive to restore use of loudspeakers at the mosque, the bench on Monday said the petitioner failed to produce any legal or religious document establishing a right to use loudspeakers for offering prayers.A division bench said: “The top court had observed that no religion prescribes prayers be performed by disturbing the peace of others through voice amplifiers or drum beating.” At a hearing on Oct 16, HC asked the petitioner to demonstrate whether installing loudspeakers was mandatory in religious practice.The petitioner could not produce supporting material and was “not entitled to seek relief”, it said. “The SC had also noted that while there is a right to speech, there exists a right to listen or decline to listen. Nobody can be compelled to listen, and nobody can claim he has a right to make his voice trespass the minds of others,” the bench observed.

Do we need a law that deals with marital rape? Watch what Delhi, Mumbai residents have to say

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Friday introduced a private member’s bill in the Lok Sabha to criminalise marital rape, calling it an urgent need to uphold women’s rights, emphasising India’s constitutional values.Speaking during the introduction of the bill, the veteran Congress leader told the parliament that the country must move from “No means no” to “Only yes means yes"".In his social media posts later, Tharoor said the marital rape bill seeks to amend the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita and remove the current exception that allows non-consensual sex within marriage.“Every woman deserves bodily autonomy and dignity within marriage. Marital rape is about violence, not marriage. The moment for action has arrived,” he said.The bill notes that Section 63 of the law currently excludes marital rape as a punishable offence, leaving married women without legal protection and perpetuating outdated patriarchal notions.""This failure to criminalise marital rape has left married women legally defenceless, distinguishing them from unmarried women and perpetuating the misconception that marriage voids the necessity of consent.This undermines women's fundamental rights to dignity, safety and bodily autonomy,"" the statement of objects and reasons of the bill said.""Allowing a husband to force sex upon his wife disregards her autonomy and perpetuates a culture of control and gender-based violence. Similarly, factors unrelated to a woman's autonomy, such as her caste, profession, clothing choices, personal beliefs or past sexual conduct, should never be used to presume her consent. Such assumptions not only perpetuate gender-based inequality but also violate her fundamental rights and dignity. They must be unequivocally rejected,"" the statement further said.Tharoor also introduced two other private members’ bills — one to amend the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020, and another to set up a permanent States and Union Territories Reorganisation Commission to guide future reorganisation of states and Union territories.A private member bills allow MPs from opposition parties to propose laws, though most are withdrawn after government review.",The bill seeks to amend the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita and remove the current exception that allows non-consensual sex within marriage.

'Israel-India Defense Ties Are Long-Standing And Strategic': Expert Danny Citrinowicz

NEW DELHI: Israel has urged India to formally designate Hamas and other groups acting against it as terrorist organisations, saying that New Delhi’s position carries significant weight across South Asia.Senior officials from Israel’s ministry of foreign affairs, speaking in Jerusalem, said they believe India understands the “networks and linkages” behind these organisations. They stressed that Israel had already proscribed Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and now expects “reciprocation” from India.“Our request from India is to work hard to sanction and designate these organisations as terrorist groups. Israel designated Lashkar-e-Taiba a couple of years ago, and we would like to see this reciprocated,” one official said, as quoted by ANI.Israel also underlined what it described as strong ties between Hamas and LeT, and warned that Iran’s IRGC, Hamas and Hezbollah have increasingly been relying on transnational criminal groups to conduct attacks.“You're not going to see an Iranian operative act directly in Europe. What you will see is a criminal group -- a drug lord, a human trafficker or another network -- connected to an Iranian handler who then carries out an attack, as we've seen in Scandinavia or in London,” the official said.The remarks came just days after a similar appeal from the Israeli Defence Forces. “It will be a good thing if India did. India and Israel have a common enemy. It will be good to have a clear statement on who we face,” Lt Col Nadav Shoshani, International Spokesperson for the IDF, said in Tel Aviv on December 1.Another official emphasised that even a declaratory move from India would have a “strong global impact”, given the influence India holds in the region. “Neighbouring countries such as Bangladesh, Pakistan and the Maldives ‘look up to India’, and New Delhi’s stance shapes regional responses,” the official said.“It's not only about freezing assets or banning operatives from entering India. It signals that India has clearly seen what Hamas is doing, and no operative should step on Indian soil,” he added.“We are putting pressure on India to designate Hamas... After having designated Lashkar-e-Taiba, we would like to see the same,” the official said, noting “clear attempts” by Hamas to rebuild its structures and stressing that dismantling them remains central to the next phase of the US-proposed ceasefire.Hamas, founded in 1987 as an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, is designated a terrorist organisation by the US, UK, Canada and several other countries.

HasanAbi challenges Asmongold’s rhetoric and debate avoidance





Hasan Piker, widely known as HasanAbi, has sharply criticized fellow Twitch streamer Asmongold after a recent viral rant in which Asmongold attacked Congresswoman Ilhan Omar and made sweeping comments about immigrants and Muslim communities. On his livestream, HasanAbi described the clip asaccusing Asmongold of pushing harmful stereotypes and misleading narratives about Somali and Muslim immigrants in the U.S. Hasan argued that Asmongold’s stance had little to do with actual policy debates and everything to do with prejudice against Omar’s identity, including her race, religion, and hijab.The controversy began when Asmongold labeled Ilhan Omar aimplied she should be deported despite being a U.S. citizen, and referenced isolated welfare fraud cases to generalize an entire population. He also dismissed Islamophobia as a made-up concept and referred to African countries aswhile claiming immigrants are prioritizing foreign issues over American concerns. HasanAbi responded by calling these claims not only racist but factually incorrect. He also mocked Asmongold’s own personal living setup, ahe refuses to repair, as ironic commentary on who is truly neglecting their own opportunities.During his stream, Hasan argued that Asmongold benefits from minimal pushback due to bot farms and coordinated efforts that drown out critical responses on platforms like Reddit and Twitter. According to Hasan, right-wing creators receive algorithmic and community shielding that prevents accountability, while left-leaning figures face harsher scrutiny and faster disciplinary action. He emphasized that Asmongold’s talking points rely on emotional outrage rather than facts, and extended a challenge for a debate, though he predicted Asmongold would refuse because his arguments would collapse under pressure.Hasan further noted that Ilhan Omar has championed progressive policies such as Medicare for All, free college, and supporting workers’ unions, topics he believes Asmongold deliberately ignores to instead attack her identity. The lack of policy criticism, Hasan said, exposes the real motivation behind the rant: bigotry packaged as political commentary.The exchange has fueled heated conversation across Twitch and social media, with supporters of both creators defending their viewpoints. Whether Asmongold responds directly remains uncertain, but Hasan’s comments make one thing clear: he believes unchecked hate speech online is dangerous and must be called out, especially when directed at public officials already facing threats and discrimination.Also Read: How valuable MrBeast’s Beast Industries has become and what it means for fans","Hasan Piker, widely known as HasanAbi, has sharply criticized fellow Twitch streamer Asmongold after a recent viral rant in which he attacked Congresswoman Ilhan Omar.

Gianni Infantino praises Donald Trump for peace work during World Cup week

President Donald Trump got a new FIFA Peace Prize on December 5, 2025, during the 2026 World Cup draw. Trump got the Prize because FIFA said he took “strong and special actions for peace” around the world. This was the main reason the award was given to him on December 5, 2025, at the 2026 World Cup draw event.The prize moment came right before the draw started, and it surprised many people. FIFA usually talks only about soccer, not world peace. But this time, the night felt very different, and it felt very focused on Trump. FIFA said the new prize is made for people who help bring peace and unity to people in many places.Donald Trump was the favorite to win it. He has been asking for a Nobel Peace Prize for a long time, and he is known to be close to FIFA President Gianni Infantino. Infantino has said many times that he thinks Trump should have already won the Nobel for helping with the Gaza ceasefire talks.At the event, Infantino gave Trump a gold medal, a certificate, and a gold trophy with Trump’s name on it. The trophy showed hands holding the world. Trump put the medal around his neck right away. Infantino said, “This is your peace prize,” and told Trump he was a leader who “cares about the people.”President Donald Trump thanked his family, including Melania Trump, for standing by him. He also thanked Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, the leaders of the other two World Cup host nations. Trump said the teamwork with Canada and Mexico has been “outstanding.”He also said, “This is truly one of the great honours of my life.”The moment drew loud reactions because FIFA has almost never given a prize like this before.One day before the award, on December 4, Gianni Infantino was in Washington for an event at the newly renamed Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace. There, Donald Trump watched leaders from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda sign a deal to help stop the fighting in eastern Congo. Infantino said soccer can help bring people together and that peace is something everyone should work for.FIFA explained that the Peace Prize is for people who take “exceptional and extraordinary actions for peace.” The award also came during a busy week for Trump’s team. U.S. officials were working on talks to help end the Ukraine war. At the same time, the administration faced questions about deadly strikes on suspected drug boats in the Caribbean, and Trump made stronger comments about immigration.This year’s Nobel Peace Prize went to Maria Corina Machado from Venezuela. After getting the prize, she said she was giving part of her honour to Donald Trump for “his decisive support of our cause.”Also Read: “79-Year Old Kid”: Joe Rogan Reveals Donald Trump Is An Odd Guy As New Talks Rise About His Private Behavior","President Donald Trump got a new FIFA Peace Prize on December 5, 2025, during the 2026 World Cup draw.

Pak President Zardari Approves Asim Munir As The First Chief Of Defence Forces Amid Power Tensions

Why Imran Khan still remains a threat to Asim Munir





PTI without Imran: Still a major force





PTI was barred from contesting the 2024 general elections.

Dozens of PTI leaders were detained.

PTI-backed independents still won more seats than any other group.

Popularity that has not faded





A 2023 Gallup Pakistan survey showed 61% of Pakistanis had a “good opinion” of him -- the highest rating among all national leaders as reported by Dawn.

Arab News quoted analysts saying Khan remains ""too politically relevant to sideline.""

Televised appearances that trigger unrest





Nationwide protests

Arson and clashes

Attacks on military installations, including the Corps Commander’s residence in Lahore

Nationwide mobile shutdowns and troop deployment

Why Pak army cannot 'eliminate' Imran Khan





Key factors keeping Khan politically alive:





Victimhood narrative: Solitary confinement and restricted access cast him as a political prisoner, a powerful image in Pakistan’s grievance-driven politics.

Mobilisation without presence: PTI’s digital machinery enables mass mobilisation even without Khan physically present.

Diaspora and social media influence: Global PTI networks amplify every statement, intensifying scrutiny on Pakistan’s military.

High-risk optics: Every court appearance or televised moment risks sparking unrest.

The state vs sentiment





The jail sentence - not the silence





Constitutional shift and expanding military power





Munir's foreign outreach and US engagement





Imran's strength: Mobilisation without access





Why the military needs more than power









Is Imran Khan still a threat to Asim Munir ? The question looms over Pakistan ’s power structure. Former Prime Minister and cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan, now over two years into imprisonment, remains a potent challenge to army chief Asim Munir — whose rapid ascent and consolidation of authority have made him Pakistan’s de facto ruler.With Munir now elevated as the Pakistan's first chief of defence forces, commanding the army, navy and air force, his institutional power is at its strongest — yet the confrontation with Khan, even from behind bars, continues to shadow that authority. The two have been locked in a prolonged, deeply personal confrontation.Despite being confined, Khan has transformed from a jailed political leader into a symbolic and political counterweight to Munir’s expanding military-political dominance.Far from fading, the rivalry between the two men has only sharpened. Munir commands the state; Khan commands sentiment. And as the events of the last two years show, sentiment can be far harder to control.Imran Khan's incarceration has fuelled a narrative of persecution and martyrdom among supporters. Long spells of isolation, restrictions on visits, and recurring allegations of mistreatment have strengthened this perception, with some analysts warning that these measures risk backfiring.Imtiaz Gul, executive director of the Center for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), told Al Jazeera: ""The primary objective of blocking access and keeping Khan in solitary confinement is apparently meant to break him into (agreeing to) a compromise and neutralise the groundswell of anti-government sentiment.”Increasingly, barring visits to Khan is viewed not merely as a security decision, but as a political strategy that may harm the governing PML-N and reinforce Khan’s narrative of institutional overreach.Even without its leader on the ballot, PTI remains one of Pakistan's strongest political forces.PTI claims widespread rigging, accusing the government and military of manipulating the results, allegations echoed by several independent observers. The establishment denies all wrongdoing, but the perception of electoral injustice has only strengthened PTI’s street momentum.For perspective, Imran Khan’s PTI had won 151 seats in the 2018 elections, defeating Nawaz Sharif’s PML-N (81 seats) and PPP (54). That victory was hailed by PTI as ""the end of an era,"" breaking the decades-long political monopoly of the PML-N, PPP and the military establishment.Despite his imprisonment, Khan remains Pakistan’s most popular political figure.This enduring popularity, even at a time of complete political inability, poses a direct challenge to Munir's authority.Even brief, controlled public appearances continue to spark major political reactions.During the May 2023 unrest, Imran Khan's court appearance -- after his dramatic arrest by paramilitary forces -- showed him flashing a victory sign. The televised images spread instantly and triggered:These scenes were unprecedented not only for their scale but because the anger erupted in Punjab, the heart of Pakistan's military recruitment and administrative base.More recently, when false rumours about Khan’s death spread, PTI supporters mobilised across Islamabad, Rawalpindi, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, again forcing an immediate government response.A leader who provokes unrest without speaking remains difficult to contain.An analysis in The Diplomat warns that the army ""cannot afford to eliminate"" a leader with deep political roots in Punjab.Such an act, the report cautions, could ""unleash one that the state may not survive.""Khan is ethnically Pashtun but politically anchored in Punjab, with support stretching across Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and the diaspora. His arrest in 2023 showed that anger against the military establishment now emerges in Punjab.Eliminating him would not neutralise his influence; it would likely create a ""martyr"" of unprecedented scale.Munir commands the state apparatus. Khan commands sentiment.And in Pakistan, sentiment has repeatedly proved more enduring than power.No prime minister has survived a confrontation with the military, but no army chief has faced a jailed leader with such widespread support and political resilience.Since August 2023, Khan has faced a series of corruption and security-related cases. In January 2025, he received a 14-year sentence in a land-graft case, a verdict his supporters claim was engineered to keep him out of politics.Khan’s public statements from jail fuel the perception of political persecution. He has directly accused Munir of ""moral bankruptcy,"" and called him ""mentally unstable man"" claiming Pakistan's constitution and rule of law have collapsed under him: ""I have been kept in complete solitary confinement, locked inside a cell with no contact with a single human being for four weeks… even the basic necessities guaranteed under the jail manual have been taken away from us. ""His family members have echoed concerns about his treatment. His sister, after visiting him, said he told her they were subjecting him to ""mental torture"" and held Asim Munir responsible.The recent 27th amendment -- widely called a ""constitutional coup"" -- has entrenched military dominance further. Munir's elevation as chief of defence forces gives him command over all three services.Mahmood Khan Achakzai, head of Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-e-Pakistan, warned: ""There is no constitution in Pakistan now. No judiciary. No social contract. They have made one man into a king above all.""Months ago, Munir's increasing visibility included multiple meetings with Donald Trump. Munir even nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, crediting him with easing India–Pakistan high military tensions, a move driven by a desire for US recognition. Trump later referred to him as his ""favourite field marshal.""It is often assumed that political power requires physical presence. Imran's continuing influence disproves that assumption.His followers still speak of him not as a convicted convict, but as a leader wronged. The slogans, the sense of injustice, the personal stories -- all add up to mobilisation potential. And that potential doesn’t require Khan’s freedom; it only requires people’s belief.Statements from his family amplify this -- for instance, the anguish voiced by his son over not knowing whether his father is safe in jail. Such public airing of fear and trauma becomes a magnet for sympathy and solidarity.""Not knowing whether your father is safe, injured or even alive is a form of psychological torture,"" he had said in written remarks.However, Imran Khan's sister was eventually allowed to meet the former prime minister. After the visit, she said, ""Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he told me they are subjecting him to mental torture, and that Asim Munir is responsible for all of this.""For the military leadership under Asim Munir, the calculus is not just about brute strength, it is about legitimacy. Pakistan’s power dynamics have long relied on a veneer of neutrality: the idea that the army guards the system while politics handles politics. Overplaying that role risks shattering the illusion.From Ayub Khan and Yahya Khan to Zia-ul-Haq and Pervez Musharraf , every era of military rule reinforced the pattern: the army positioned itself not merely as a defender of borders, but as the ultimate arbiter of Pakistan's politics and identity.Each takeover was justified through narratives of chaos, corruption, or national security, allowing the establishment to retain dominance even during civilian periods. Today, under Asim Munir, this pattern continues in a more sophisticated form: instead of overt coups, power is exercised through constitutional engineering, judicial pressure, and political sidelining, most visibly in the dismantling of Imran Khan’s political career. The military’s quest is not only to command the state but to remain indispensable to its very definition.As long as Imran Khan remains a contested figure, not just legally, but symbolically, the army's claim to neutrality becomes harder to maintain.International pressure, media scrutiny, and internal dissent all rise with every heavy-handed move.Hence, the challenge for Munir may be deeper than suppressing one man, it is about managing optics, institutional trust and political fallout.",Is Imran Khan still a threat to Asim Munir? The question looms over Pakistan ’s power structure. Khan has transformed from a jailed political leader into a symbolic and political counterweight to Munir’s expanding military-political dominance.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125789753,imgsize-1800195,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-62.jpg"
"Ghaziabad Jeweller Murder: Killed in 60 seconds, Ghaziabad jeweller stabbed to death during robbery; accused watched 25 YouTube ‘heist tutorials’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ghaziabad/ghaziabad-jeweller-75-stabbed-to-death-during-heist-attacker-had-rs-20l-debt/articleshow/125774855.cms,"GHAZIABAD: A 75-year-old jewellery shop owner in Modinagar was stabbed to death on Thursday morning during a robbery in Govindpuri. CCTV footage, retrieved by police, shows the victim seated at the counter when a man wearing a monkey cap enters, throws red chilli powder in his face, then climbs onto the counter and stabs him more than 10 times. The assailant was caught by local residents after a brief chase, about 30 metres from the shop, and later detained by police.The incident occurred shortly after 8.30 am, when the victim, Girdhari Lal, had opened his shop, Girdhari Lal & Sons Jewellery, on the ground floor of his residence. Locals said Lal, a long-time resident of Govindpuri colony, typically opened his store earlier than others in the area, a routine the assailant, Ankit Gupta, allegedly knew.A bike taxi rider living in the same area until his family relocated a month ago, Gupta was allegedly under financial stress after losing around Rs 20 lakh in shares and online gaming, police said. He knew that Lal owned three other jewellery shops and was well off. For a week, he recced Lal's Govindpuri shop and timed his attack to coincide with the early opening hours to take advantage of the lack of customers and other shopkeepers in the vicinity, police said.On Thursday, the accused entered the shop just after Lal began his day. He threw a fistful of red chilli powder into Lal's face. And even before Lal could react, Gupta climbed onto the shop's counter and slashed and stabbed him repeatedly with a knife, leaving him dead within seconds.Lal's son, Rupendra Soni, heard his father's screams and rushed into the shop, and tried to restrain the attacker. Soni hurled the assailant on a bench, but Soni pulled out what appeared to be a gun—a later investigation revealed it was a toy—and managed to give him a slip.As Soni chased him, local shopkeepers, responding to the commotion, captured the assailant roughly 25-30 metres from the shop. He was beaten by the crowd before being handed over to the police.The entire assault that lasted fewer than 60 seconds was captured in a CCTV camera installed in the shop. Police said they were analysing CCTV footage and gathering witness accounts to reconstruct the events in full.ACP Modinagar Amit Saxena said preliminary investigations indicated that Gupta targeted Lal's shop with the intention to steal jewellery. ""He had planned the robbery around a week in advance. After attacking Lal, he had planned to grab the jewellery on display in a bag that he was carrying. It seems he hadn't anticipated that Soni or anyone would arrive so quickly,"" the officer said, adding that a toy gun had been recovered from Gupta.DCP (Rural) Surendra Nath Tiwari said Gupta has been detained and is being questioned. While no FIR was lodged till the filing of the report, police said the process of registering one was on.Police said the accused had bought the knife online and received it only on Wednesday. In the five days leading up to the crime, Gupta allegedly watched more than 25 heist videos on YouTube to prepare for the robbery, cops added. He also claimed to own a YouTube channel, Desire Telefilms, that has 6,25,000 subscribers.The attack sparked outrage among local residents and shopkeepers, many of whom shut down shops in protest, accusing the police of failing to maintain law and order. Sudheer Singh, a local shopkeeper, said, ""The police chowki is just 200m away, yet patrolling is rare. A robbery attempt at Lal's shop happened two years ago, and the culprits were never caught. Even recent thefts in nearby shops are unresolved.""DCP Tiwari assured the community that additional police forces had been deployed and that security measures in the area would be reviewed. He confirmed that a dedicated team would remain stationed in the market to prevent future incidents and increase patrolling in the area.","A 75-year-old jewellery shop owner was stabbed to death on Thursday morning during a robbery in Govindpuri.

136 killed in flood



Police released distress calls







Heart-wrenching pleas poured into the Kerrville, Texas, police department’s Telecommunications Center as catastrophic floods swept across the Hill Country in the early hours of July 4.Newly released 911 recordings capture the disaster minute by minute — from the first uneasy warnings to the panic-stricken cries of people watching the water rise by inches, then feet, through homes and cabins along the Guadalupe River, AP news agency reported.What begins as a handful of calm, almost prophetic calls quickly erupts into chaos. In an instant, frantic voices overwhelmed the two county emergency dispatchers on duty: a firefighter clinging to a tree after seeing his wife swept away; a family smashing through their roof in a desperate bid to survive; a woman stranded at an all-girls camp as swirling waters closed in.More than 400 calls for help flooded Kerr County’s emergency lines that night, recordings released Friday show — , revealed the scale of the overnight floods that killed at least 136 people statewide and prompted chaotic rescue efforts.The recordings capture frantic pleas from residents trapped in cabins, trees and on rooftops as floodwaters from the Guadalupe River rose rapidly.Camp counsellors, residents, firefighters and emergency dispatchers feature in the calls.A camp counsellor at Camp La Junta reported, “There’s water filling up super fast, we can’t get out of our cabin. We can’t get out of our cabin, so how do we get to the boats?” All cabin occupants and other campers were subsequently rescued.The flooding claimed at least 136 lives during the holiday weekend, including 117 in Kerr County. Most victims were Texas residents; others came from Alabama, California and Florida, according to a county list. Among those who died were 25 campers and two teenage counsellors at Camp Mystic, a century-old girls’ summer camp.The floodings occurred overnight on the July Fourth holiday last summer. Recordings were made public on Friday. Where: Heavy rain caused the Guadalupe River to overtop its banks, inundating Kerr County in the Texas Hill Country. Calls came from sites including riverside cabins and summer camps such as Camp La Junta and Camp Mystic.Exceptional rainfall led the Guadalupe River to overflow without warning. Residents and officials have questioned whether sufficient alerts were issued before the floods struck. Two county officials told state legislators they were asleep during the initial hours and a third was out of town.First responders and volunteers rescued people using boats and emergency vehicles. Some survivors clung to trees and rooftops. Kerrville Police Chief Chris McCall warned that some audio is unsettling, as it includes calls from those who did not survive.In one call, firefighter Bradley Perry said calmly, “The tree I’m in is starting to lean and it’s going to fall. Is there a helicopter close?” He added, “I’ve probably got maybe five minutes left.”Perry did not survive; his wife Tina was later found alive, clinging to a tree. Other calls recorded trapped families moving to higher floors.A woman in a riverside cabin community reported, “We are flooding, and we have people in cabins we can’t get to. We are flooding almost all the way to the top.”Children’s voices are faintly heard in the background. As daylight approached, call volume rose. Dispatchers, overwhelmed but composed, advised callers to seek rooftops or higher ground.One caller from Camp Mystic said, “There is water everywhere, we cannot move. We are upstairs in a room and the water is rising,” and later asked, “How do we get to the roof if the water is so high? Can you already send someone here? With the boats?” The dispatcher replied, “I don’t know. I don’t know.”","The floodings occurred overnight on the July Fourth holiday last summer.

FACING ARDUOUS BUS JOURNEY

BENGALURU: Amid the ongoing chaos caused by IndiGo canceling numerous flights across India, Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) — both Terminals 1 and 2 — turned into scenes of frustration and exhaustion. Hundreds of stranded passengers chanted “Down Down, IndiGo” following multiple cancellations since December 2. The widespread operational disruptions left travellers confused, hungry, and, in many cases, without access to basic facilities.A young woman, having run out of sanitary napkins, found the airport pharmacy completely out of stock. Frustrated, she approached staff for help but received no assistance.Her father, angered by the lack of support, confronted the pharmacy and IndiGo officials, demanding answers. In a video, he was seen shouting, “Sister, my daughter needs a sanitary pad,” while protesting the unavailability of basic necessities for passengers.Priyansh Vijayvargiya, a distance MBA student from Indore, is growing increasingly anxious about his IndiGo flight scheduled for Saturday. The same flight was cancelled on Dec 3 and 4, and he is yet to receive any communication from the airline regarding the status of his journey.Priyansh contacted his college for guidance but was told that his exams on Dec 8 would proceed as planned, leaving him with no flexibility.With uncertainty mounting, he is now considering an arduous alternative: taking a bus to Hyderabad and then another long bus ride to Indore.Meanwhile, passengers complained of worsening conditions at both terminals. “I haven’t had food in seven hours. Every restaurant is out of food,” said Karan Bora, a passenger heading to Madhya Pradesh. “The crowds are so big that even water kiosks are empty.”Several others were seen strug gling with medical needs. “I’m diabetic. I need my medicines every four hours,” said Revathi Narayan, a 67-year-old traveller who was waiting since Thursday night, after her luggage was checked in and she could not retrieve it.","Hundreds of stranded passengers chanted ‘Down Down, IndiGo’ following multiple cancellations since December 2.

TENSE ENCOUNTER: Reporter CONFRONTS Trump On 'PEACEMAKER' Claim; 'Do You Really Deserve FIFA Award?'





The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear a landmark case challenging the constitutionality of US President Donald Trump ’s effort to end birthright citizenship.The dispute arises from an executive order the president signed on his first day back in office, which sought to strip children born in the United States to undocumented immigrants and certain temporary foreign residents of their automatic citizenship rights.""The Trump Administration looks forward to making its case on the issue of birthright citizenship on behalf of the American people,"" Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, stated, as cited by NBC News.A final ruling in the New Hampshire case, expected by the end of June, is likely to decide once and for all whether Trump’s proposal can proceed.The executive order, immediately blocked by the courts before it could take effect, challenged the long-standing principle that anyone born in the United States is automatically a citizen, a standard upheld since 1898.If implemented, it could put the citizenship of hundreds of thousands of children born each year at risk. Birthright citizenship, which grants nearly all children born on American soil citizenship regardless of their parents’ status, has long been regarded as a fundamental principle of the nation.This concept, uncommon among the world’s most developed countries, is rooted in the 14th Amendment, ratified after the Civil War, which states: ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.""Trump has repeatedly questioned the practice. After securing his second term in November 2024, Trump said that he intended to end it.""We're going to have to get it changed,"" he said in an interview with NBC News. ""We're going to end that because it's ridiculous.""Allies of Trump have argued that the 14th Amendment was originally intended to grant citizenship only to the children of formerly enslaved people and has been misapplied to the children of undocumented migrants. Once considered a fringe theory, Trump’s support has helped popularize it among conservative circles.In an effort to act on his promise, Trump signed an executive order stating that the policy would take effect in 30 days. However, legal challenges emerged almost immediately. Judges in Washington, Maryland, and Massachusetts quickly blocked the order nationwide, with one federal district judge in Seattle, John C. Coughenour, describing it as ""blatantly unconstitutional,” as cited by the New York Times.","The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear a landmark case challenging the constitutionality of US President Donald Trump ’s effort to end birthright citizenship.

An Arizona congressperson, Adelita Grijalva, said she was sprayed in the face by federal agents during a protest against an Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid outside Taco Giro in Tucson on Friday.In video footage of the incident, agents in tactical gear confronted protesters carrying anti-ICE signs. As Grijalva approached, an agent sprayed an orange chemical in the protesters’ direction.She can be heard coughing and urging the officers to “calm down” and “get out”. In another clip, a projectile landed at her feet as she stepped forward. Grijalva said she had joined a group of demonstrators outside the “small mom-and-pop” restaurant, which she visits weekly, after they had “stopped” a squadron of mostly masked ICE agents.. “The protesters were afraid that they were taking people without due process,” she said. “When I presented myself as a Member of Congress asking for more information, I was pushed aside and pepper sprayed,” she wrote.The Department of Homeland Security denied that the agents targeted her. “If her claims were true, this would be a medical marvel,” the DHS spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, said.“But they’re not true. She wasn’t pepper sprayed. She was in the vicinity of someone who was pepper sprayed as they were obstructing and assaulting law enforcement.”McLaughlin added that two officers were “seriously injured” and that “presenting one’s self as a ‘Member of Congress’ doesn’t give you the right to obstruct law enforcement”.An ICE spokesperson, Fernando Burgos, said special agents and officers from the agency’s Homeland Security Investigations were “executing 16 search warrants” across southern Arizona as part of a “years-long investigation into immigration and tax violations”.Multiple individuals were taken into custody during the operation. In video footage of the incident, agents in tactical gear confronted protesters carrying anti-ICE signs.Local officials praised the Tucson police department for helping to calm the situation.In a joint statement, Regina Romero, the Tucson mayor, and Lane Santa Cruz, the vice-mayor, both Democrats, said the enforcement operation had “rapidly escalated into violence against the public”.“Their disproportionate use of force, smoke grenades and pepper balls against the public, including our own Representative Adelita Grijalva, is not justified and cannot be tolerated,” they wrote, urging bystanders to share video and photographs for “potential investigation and follow-up”. Arizona Democrats rallied around Grijalva.Representative Greg Stanton called the incident “outrageous” while Representative Yassamin Ansari described it as “absolutely unacceptable”. Senator Ruben Gallego wrote: “Pepper-spraying a sitting member of Congress is disgraceful, unacceptable, and absolutely not what we voted for. Period.”At a town hall in Tucson later that day, Senator Mark Kelly referred to the event as “horrific”. Grijalva was elected to Congress in September in a special election to fill the seat left vacant by the death of her father, the late representative Raúl Grijalva.She was sworn in last month after the House reconvened from a recess during the federal govt shutdown. “If federal agents are brazen enough to fire pellets directly at a Member of Congress,” she wrote on Friday, “imagine how they behave when encountering defenseless members of our community.”","Adelita Grijalva said she was sprayed in the face by federal agents during a protest against an Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid outside Taco Giro in Tucson on Friday.

NATO Nation Cautions Europe | 'VERY FRIGHTENING'





Russian President Vladimir Putin's alleged secret daughter, Luiza Rozova, apologised for the Ukraine war when Ukrainian journalist Dmytro Sviatnenko confronted her on the streets of Paris.Sviatnenko’s brother, drone pilot Volodymyr, had been killed in a Russian airstrike in November, and the reporter demanded Rozova speak to her alleged father and urge him to end the conflict.“Three weeks ago, your father killed my brother,” Sviatnenko told Rozova. When asked if she supported Putin’s policies, she replied, “I did not give you permission to film me,” covering her mouth with a mask, New York Post reported.“I’m really sorry that this is happening. Unfortunately, I’m not responsible for this situation,” Rozova, 22 year old DJ, added.Sviatnenko pointed out that Kyiv was without power and under an air raid alert, and again asked how she felt about her father’s policies. Rozova responded, “What does that have to do with me?” He suggested she call her father and say, “Dad, stop shelling Kyiv.” Rozova said, “Well, of course,” but explained she could not arrange travel.When Sviatnenko offered to buy her a plane ticket to Ukraine so she could perform “better than any Patriot air defence system” and end the “mess” in his country, Rozova said, “Unfortunately, I can’t help you. I’m very sorry.”Who is Rozova?Rozova is alleged to be the love child of Putin and his former mistress, cleaner-turned-multimillionaire Svetlana Krivonogikh. Born in 2003, she was outed as Putin’s alleged secret daughter in 2020 by Russian media outlet Proekt, which cited her “phenomenal resemblance” to her alleged dad. The outlet reported that Putin was not listed on Rozova’s birth certificate but that her patronymic “Vladimirovna” meant “daughter of Vladimir. ”An art school graduate, Rozova had largely kept a low profile until she became more active on social media. In August, she appeared to condemn Putin in a post on Telegram without naming him, writing, “It’s liberating to be able to show my face to the world again” and “It reminds me of who I am and who destroyed my life,” according to Bild.","Russian President Vladimir Putin's alleged secret daughter, Luiza Rozova, apologised for the Ukraine war.

The United States is planning to expand the number of countries that were covered by its travel ban - and the new list may include over 30 countries.US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, on Thursday, during an interview on Fox News’ The Ingraham Angle, when asked whether President Donald Trump’s administration would increase the number to 32, she said “I won’t be specific on the number, but it’s over 30, and the president is continuing to evaluate countries. ""In June, Trump signed a proclamation banning citizens of 12 countries from entering the United States and restricting those from seven others, saying it was needed to protect against “foreign terrorists” and other security threats, Reuters reported.The bans applied to both immigrants and non-immigrants, such as tourists, students and business travellers.Noem did not specify which countries would be added to the list. “If they don’t have a stable government there, if they don’t have a country that can sustain itself and tell us who those individuals are and help us vet them, why should we allow people from that country to come here to the United States?” she said.Reuters previously reported that the Trump administration was considering banning citizens of 36 additional countries from entering the United States, according to an internal State Department cable.An expansion of the list would mark a further escalation of migration measures the administration had taken since the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, DC, last week.Investigators said the shooting was carried out by an Afghan national who entered the US in 2021 through a resettlement programme under which Trump administration officials have argued there was insufficient vetting. Days after the shooting, Trump vowed to “permanently pause” migration from all “Third World Countries,” although he did not identify any by name or define “third-world countries.”Prior to that, officials from the Department of Homeland Security said Trump had ordered a widespread review of asylum cases approved under the administration of his predecessor, Democratic President Joe Biden, and Green Cards issued to citizens of 19 countries. Since returning to office in January, Trump has aggressively prioritised immigration enforcement, sending federal agents to major US cities and turning away asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border.

US federal judge orders release of Epstein grand jury transcripts after Donald Trump signs Transparency Act,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-federal-judge-orders-release-of-epstein-grand-jury-transcripts-after-donald-trump-signs-transparency-act/articleshow/125798528.cms,"Epstein's Blackboard Of 'Plots,' 'Power,' And 'Deception' Exposed





US District Judge Rodney Smith on Friday ordered the release of grand jury transcripts from the Florida investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein . Judge Smith said in a brief order that the Epstein Files Transparency Act mandates their release.The Justice Department requested the unsealing after President Donald Trump signed a bill last month requiring the public release of all govt records regarding Epstein. Grand jury proceedings are generally kept secret, and a previous Justice Department request to unseal the transcripts from Epstein’s Florida case was rebuffed.Epstein pleaded guilty in Florida in 2008 to a state charge of soliciting a minor for prostitution. The wealthy financier was arrested again in New York in 2019 on charges of sex trafficking of minors. He died while in pre-trial detention, and his death was ruled to be a suicide.The Justice Department is also seeking the release of the grand jury transcripts from the New York case and that of Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for recruiting underage girls for Epstein.Trump, a once close friend of Epstein, fought for months to prevent the release of the Epstein files held by the Justice Department.However, on November 19 he caved to pressure from Congress, including from his Republican Party, and signed a law compelling release of the materials.The Epstein Files Transparency Act calls for the release within 30 days of ""all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials"" in the possession of the Justice Department, the FBI and US attorneys’ offices related to Epstein and Maxwell.The FBI and Justice Department triggered a political furor in July with the release of a memo stating that after an ""exhaustive review"" of the Epstein files no evidence had emerged that would warrant further investigation.","The Justice Department requested the unsealing after President Donald Trump signed a bill last month requiring the public release of all govt records regarding Epstein.

Vice President JD Vance on Friday dismissed a wave of online speculation about his marriage, saying his relationship with Second Lady Usha Vance is “as strong as it’s ever been.”He said the couple has taken the growing swirl of social media rumors in stride, opting to laugh off the speculation about their personal lives.This comes after a recent rash of tabloid-style headlines that surfaced when the second lady was photographed without her wedding ring.“I think that we kind of get a kick out of it,” Vance said in an interview with NBC News, when asked whether the recent controversy had frustrated him.“With anything in life, you take the good with the bad,” Vance said, adding that ""there are some sacrifices and there are some very good things that come along with it, too. But our marriage is as strong as it’s ever been, and I think Usha’s really taken to it, and it’s been kind of cool to see how she’s developed and evolved in this new role.”The couple’s marriage drew online scrutiny after Usha Vance was spotted without her wedding ring during a November 19 visit to Camp Lejeune, a military training facility in Jacksonville, North Carolina, where she accompanied First Lady Melania Trump.The attention intensified in October when former White House press secretary Jen Psaki sparked controversy by joking about “saving” Usha Vance from her marriage to the vice president, prompting a sharp response from the White House.Responding after the photos of her missing wedding ring went viral, a spokesperson for the second lady said in a statement that she is “a mother of three young children, who does a lot of dishes, gives lots of baths and forgets her ring sometimes.”Vance shared a more recent anecdote from a few days earlier, recounting how he and his wife were rushing to the White House before the second lady departed for another event with Melania Trump. As she got into the car, Usha Vance realized she had once again left her rings behind after taking a shower.“She was like, ‘Oh, if I don’t go back and get them, there’s going to be some ridiculous psycho who talks about it on social media,’” Vance was quoted as saying by NBC News. “And I was like, let them. It’s not even worth the trip to run back upstairs. So we actually have a little bit of fun with it. And we thought that whole viral social media cycle was kind of funny.”The vice president addressed the situation when asked whether such stories had been difficult for the couple, who tied the knot in 2014.“It’s funny,” he said. “I actually don’t think that it’s tough.”The couple has been in the spotlight since US President Donald Trump chose Vance as his running mate for the 2024 presidential election.They met at Yale Law School, married in 2014, and have three children. Usha Vance previously worked as a trial lawyer at the Munger, Tolles & Olson law firm but stepped away from her career shortly after her husband joined the ticket.","Vice President JD Vance said his marriage to Second Lady Usha Vance is as strong as it's ever been.

Pipe bomb suspect was a supporter of Donald Trump?

The FBI arrested Brian J. Cole Jr., 30, on Thursday and charged him with transportation of an explosive device via interstate commerce and attempted malicious destruction by means of an explosive device, according to an arrest warrant filed in his case. He is alleged to have placed two pipe bombs near the Democratic and Republican committee headquarters hours before the attack on the US Capitol on January 6-2021.According to the NPR news, Cole told investigators he believed conspiracy theories that the 2020 election was stolen from then-President Trump.The Department of Justice said Cole spoke to law enforcement for more than four hours on Thursday in a custodial interview. He expressed views supportive of Trump, according to the person familiar with the investigation, who was not authorised to speak publicly.Cole spoke to investigators after his arrest at his home in Woodbridge, Va., that he shares with his mother and other family members, about 30 miles from Washington, according to an FBI affidavit filed in court.New leaders at the FBI and the DOJ intensified their focus on the case this year amid intense pressure to solve the crime from Trump’s political base.The FBI released an image with a size chart showing the height of the alleged pipe bomber at 5 foot 7 inches.Attorney General Pam Bondi said the investigation continued and more charges may be added. ""Today's arrest happened because the Trump administration made this case a priority,"" she said at a press conference on Thursday. ""This cold case languished for four years, until Director [Kash] Patel and Deputy Director [Dan] Bongino came to the FBI.""""We are working every day to restore the public's trust. We are hoping today is a significant step toward that progress,"" Bondi said at the presser.Cole made his first court appearance on Friday. He wore a beige jumpsuit and glasses and answered questions from the judge. The next hearing will be a pretrial detention hearing on Dec. 15.Bondi said the FBI had no new tips or new witnesses but had relied on ""diligent"" police and prosecutorial work to identify the suspect. The FBI had previously set a Rs 4.15 crore (approx) reward for information leading to his capture.FBI Director Kash Patel said, ""We solved it,"" adding that the suspect will still have his day in court.FBI Director Kash Patel spoke with Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum last month.An FBI affidavit said Cole purchased components that could have been used to make the pipe bombs, including electrical wire, steel wool, battery connectors and parts to close the end of a pipe.Court papers also said a cell phone tied to Cole pinged cell towers near the RNC and DNC the night the bombs were placed. A license plate reader near the area captured his car, a Nissan Sentra, that evening.Jeanine Pirro, the US attorney for the District of Columbia, said, ""This case involved millions of pieces of data, and it is a huge win, because it was like finding a needle in a haystack.""The discovery of the bombs occurred at a critical moment on January 6-2021. The first device was found just before the initial breach of rioters at the Peace Circle, and the second was discovered as the Proud Boys helped flood the Capitol's west front and the fighting was intensifying.Capitol Police Inspector General Michael Bolton told Congress in 2021, ""If those pipe bombs were intended to be a diversion, plainly speaking, it worked.""Former USCP Chief Steven Sund wrote in his book, ""I believe the timing and placement of these devices were deliberate diversionary tactics, intended to divert significant resources away from securing the Capitol, which they succeeded in doing.""Before joining the FBI as deputy director, Bongino spread conspiracies about the bomber and said it must've been an ""inside job"" by the government.","FBI arrested Brian J.

FIFA Raises Trump Speculations After Announcing ‘YMCA’ Performance For 2026 World Cup Draw





US President Donald Trump on Friday stole the spotlight at the FIFA 2026 World Cup draw when he rose from his seat at the Kennedy Center and performed his signature “YMCA” dance. The moment came as organizers brought the Village People on stage to perform the hit number, a staple at Trump campaign rallies alongside “Nessun dorma. ”Trump attended the event alongside Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.The ceremony was co-hosted by actor-comedian Kevin Hart and supermodel Heidi Klum, and featured appearances by sports icons including Tom Brady, Shaquille O’Neal, Wayne Gretzky, Eli Manning and Aaron Judge.The US president also received the inaugural FIFA Peace Prize from the sport’s global governing body.""Mr President, this is your prize. This is your peace prize,"" said Gianni Infantino, the president of the international football association as presented the prize to Trump. ""There is also a beautiful medal for you that you can wear everywhere you want to go.""Trump then placed the gong around his neck, saying, “I’m going to wear it right now.”Football fans around the world tuned in to the World Cup draw to see how the match-ups would take shape, and organizers are hoping that same global interest will translate into strong attendance at the tournament.Trump said earlier this week that ticket sales were “good,” though questions remain about how the event will ultimately unfold. The matches begin in June and will culminate in the July 19 final at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.Concerns, however, have been raised. In a July 1 letter to FIFA, more than 80 civil rights and labor groups warned that the Trump administration’s immigration policies could affect the staging of the World Cup, as cited by USA Today.At the event, Trump, Sheinbaum, and Carney took part in the proceedings by drawing their countries into predetermined World Cup groups before the remaining slots in the 12 four-team groups were filled.North Macedonia and Curaçao, whose qualification prospects have improved with the expansion of the World Cup from 32 to 48 teams, were among the beneficiaries of the new format. The increase also pushed the number of groups from eight to 12.The expanded field made the draw more complex, with six of the 48 teams still undecided. Those remaining spots will be determined through playoffs in March, requiring the use of placeholders during the draw, as cited by AP.The expanded field also reduced the likelihood of several top-tier teams being placed in the same group.",US President Donald Trump stole the spotlight at the FIFA 2026 World Cup draw when he performed his signature ‘YMCA’ dance.

Vanity Fair and West Coast editor Olivia Nuzzi have ""mutually agreed"" to part their ways after her contract with the Condé Nast-owned magazine expires.The decision came after the controversy over allegations of Nuzzi's affair with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other past behavior.A joint statement Friday from Vanity Fair and West Coast editor Olivia Nuzzi said they “have mutually agreed, in the best interest of the magazine, to let her contract expire at the end of the year.” Nuzzi had joined the magazine in September as West Coast editor, AP news agency reported.The decision followed controversy over Nuzzi’s personal relationship with Robert F Kennedy Jr. while she was a Washington correspondent for New York magazine. The relationship emerged in the fall of 2024, when it was revealed that Kennedy, then a presidential candidate and now head of the Department of Health and Human Services, had been intimately involved with Nuzzi.New York magazine dismissed Nuzzi for failing to disclose the relationship. She later reflected on the affair and its consequences in her memoir American Canto, which refers to Kennedy as “The Politician” and ex-fiancé Ryan Lizza as “the man I did not marry.”Excerpts appeared in Vanity Fair but competed for attention with a series of Substack posts by Lizza containing embarrassing allegations.The feud between Nuzzi and Lizza gripped media insiders after he alleged that she had an affair with another profile subject and had given Kennedy political advice—both considered off limits for journalists. Lizza also published salacious, cringeworthy text messages from Kennedy to Nuzzi that he had intercepted.Following the revelation, the magazine placed Nuzzi on leave, and they later parted ways. But Nuzzi had recently returned to a newsroom after Vanity Fair's recently appointed global editorial director Mark Guiducci named her West Coast editor in September.In a Substack interview with Emily Sundberg, Nuzzi denounced her ex-fiancé’s posts as “fiction-slash-revenge porn.”Friday’s announcement came only days after the publication of American Canto, which critics disdained and readers largely ignored. The book ranked just 6,094 on Amazon.com’s bestseller list as of Friday afternoon.During the turbulent week, Nuzzi published a humorous Substack column titled “Signs Your Book Rollout Has Gone Awry,” including the entry “Monica Lewinsky reaches out to check on your mental health.”","Vanity Fair and West Coast editor Olivia Nuzzi have ""mutually agreed"" to part their ways after her contract with the Condé Nast-owned magazine expires.

I would actually argue that Donald Trump deserves a Nobel Prize for bringing India and Russia together the way he did,"" he said.He further added, ""How many of these agreements (MoUs) are actually gonna come to fruition?

Because Donald Trump isn't going to admit that he is the one at fault. If you're the 65 % of Americans who dislike Donald Trump, according to the recent polls, then what we are seeing now is the result of Donald Trump's gross incompetence.""",A former Pentagon official has come up with an unexpected way to credit US President Donald Trump for boosting India–Russia ties.

FBI director Kash Patel 's girlfriend reacted and laughed off a fresh gossip that her boyfriend wanted FBI security detail to drop her 'drunk friend' home, on one occasion and was refused.

The report said the security agents objected to diverting from their assignment but Patel insisted because Winkins had requested. The report also claimed that once Patel called the head of Wilkins' security details and yelled at him.The report came as Patel had been fighting a stiff resistance against him as the FBI chief coming from inside the MAGA base. It was also reported that Kash Patel would lose his post by December 15 but President Donald Trump dismissed the speculations and said he was doing a great job. Patel's personal relationship, his use of FBI assets for his personal travels, for his girlfriend's security -- everything has come under scrutiny. Recently, a report by former FBi agents claimed that Patel threw tantrums when he reached Utah soon after Charlie Kirk's assassination, as he did not have his FBI jacket. The report claimed he was not ready to get off the plane unless he had an FBI jacket with a perfect fit.Patel himself refuted the jacket story and claimed that he was handed over a jacket, and he was honored to wear it, calling the tantrums episode 100% fabricated.

President Donald Trump's National Security Strategy 2025 , in which he outlined what he wants from the world, has been released. India found four mentions in the 29-page document and one of them was in connection with Trump's claim that he negotiated peace between India and Pakistan -- among other countries.The second mention comes where Trump says US must work with allies and partners.

This will require not just further investment in our military—especially naval—capabilities, but also strong cooperation with every nation that stands to suffer, from India to Japan and beyond, if this problem is not addressed,"" the document said.Another major takeaway from the strategy document was its firm stand against migration. ""In countries throughout the world, mass migration has strained domestic resources, increased violence and other crime, weakened social cohesion, distorted labor markets, and undermined national security. The era of mass migration must end. Border security is the primary element of national security. We must protect our country from invasion, not just from unchecked migration but from cross-border threats such as terrorism, drugs, espionage, and human trafficking.

The Donald Trump administration took a host of measures in the aftermath of DC shooting in which the suspect was identified as an Afghan national who was given asylum in the US.

Trump announced that he would terminate the Temporary Protected Status for Somalia. This would make Somalis open to be arrested. The crackdown on Somalis stemmed from financial fraud allegations in Minnesota.

Trump announced an immigration ban on 'third-world countries' without specifying which countries will be affected.

on 'third-world countries' without specifying which countries will be affected. The administration put a hold on immigration requests from 19 countries of concern. These 19 countries are those that were put on a complete/partial travel ban list earlier.

India does not feature any of these lists and there is no ban on Indians in the US. But Indian remains the center of the immigration topic as India contributes the maximum to the H-1B visa program which is a specialty visa to hire skilled workers from foreign countries.





Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal emerged as a loud voice against Donald Trump's crackdown on Somali migrants in Minnesota, as she said 'being undocumented is not a crime'. While her statement invited intense criticism, Jayapal explained that overstaying a visa or being undocumented in the US is not a criminal offence, but a civil offence and hence undocumented migrants should be held in civil detention facilities, not in prisons.""We really have to look into the problem of Indians' low self-esteem,"" Right-wing writer Ann Coulter wrote on X taking a jibe at Jayapal who was born in India.In an interview with MS Now, Jayapal also said that immigrants from Somalia, India, Latin America, and Africa built America.

Oumair Aejaz, an Indian-origin former doctor from Michigan, was sentenced to 35-60 years in prison on charges of sexual misconduct after he secretly recorded women and children exploiting his position as a doctor. He started at his home as he filmed his wife, their young children and female relatives, the wife told the police in 2024 that started the investigation. Aejaz was charged on 31 counts of sexual misconduct and he pleaded no contest. As he was sentenced on December 2, the courtroom witnessed the pain of his victims as they came forward, calling out the evil, sadistic doctor.As the women recounted how they have been affected, the judge said Oumair Aejaz's actions were beyond words. “Incomprehensible that there’s a human being that could stoop to this level of conduct. You are not deserving of any title or any recognition. You have damaged so many lives, hurt so many people and all I can do is put you in prison,” the judge said before sentencing. “I wish I could do more, but I can’t.”Investigation against Awjaz began in August 2024 after his wife submitted evidence that she was being secretly recorded.Their two minor children and several female relatives had also been filmed. Investigators found that Aejaz recoded children and adults at Goldfish Swim School in Rochester Hills, Michigan, as well as children and adults in hospital rooms and bedrooms using a hidden camera.A search warrant recovered six computers, four cell phones and 15 hard drives. One hard drive reportedly contained over 13,000 videos Aejaz recorded over the last six years.Aejaz did not speak at his sentencing but four women spoke before the judge made her decision. “Stop looking at the ground, you coward. Look up and look me in the eyes. I address you because you had the audacity when you decided to wander in the swim school, turn on a camera, place it upward in a two foot space that was at the bottom of those changing rooms, and then sit there for God knows how long just recording the moms, parents, dads, aunts, uncles, grandmas with their kids as their kids were literally changing out of their wet swimsuits. Look at me when I speak to you,” a mother who was filmed by Aejaz said. “Or you can stare at the ground and twiddle your thumbs because you know that you are done.”","Oumair Aejaz, an Indian-origin former doctor from Michigan, was sentenced to 35-60 years in prison on charges of sexual misconduct.

The USCIS has announced an immediate hold on all asylum requests pending a comprehensive review. This has nothing to do with any country. This is applicable to all asylum applications. An individual can apply for asylum in the US when they can prove that they are facing persecution in their own country.

The administration has halted all immigration requests from 19 countries pending review.

The administration will also conduct a comprehensive re-review of approved benefit requests from these 19 countries.

The candidates may get called for a potential interview and, if necessary, a re-interview, to fully assess all national security and public safety threats along with any other related grounds of inadmissibility or ineligibility. The administration said it will now do a case-by-case review and assessment.





A massive delay in processing all forms of immigration applications is now inevitable as the Donald Trump administration ordered a re-review of all Green Cards issued during the Biden administration to the nationals of 19 countries of concern. All asylum cases approved under the Biden administration from these 19 countries will also be reviewed again.Ricky Murray, who was chief of staff of Refugee and International Operations at USCIS until November 29, told Newsweek that such orders are unprecedented and this will slow down the immigration work, leading to a backlog.""This is going to have a tremendous effect on the backlog. Having to pull resources together to review hundreds of thousands of cases is going to require thousands of man-hours. These man-hours are only going to be taken from processing of new filings,"" Murray said. ""There are finite resources. You can expect to see significant delays in the processing of any new forms in the area that USCIS steals the resources from to do this re-review. """"The memo is unique in that it is using a single event to call into question the validity of the benefits of thousands of immigrants, almost all who have nothing to do with this isolated event. Immigrants of 18 of the 19 countries have no ties to this event, and even a very limited number of Afghans have ever even had contact with the perpetrator of the heinous event spurring this release of this memo,"" Murray said.",USCIS has announced an immediate hold on all asylum requests pending a comprehensive review.

Pak President Zardari Approves Asim Munir As The First Chief Of Defence Forces Amid Power Tensions





Pakistan’s defence ministry on Friday officially notified the appointment of Field Marshal Asim Munir as the country’s first Chief of Defence Forces (CDF).The ""president, on the advice of the prime minister, is pleased to appoint Field Marshal Asim Munir (NI) M as the chief of army staff, concurrently the chief of defence forces for a tenure of five years,” the notification read, news agency PTI reported citing Dawn.This comes a day after President Asif Ali Zardari approved his appointment on the advice of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.According to the notification issued under Article 243 of Pakistan’s Constitution and the amended Pakistan Army Act, Munir will serve concurrently as Chief of Army Staff and Chief of Defence Forces for a tenure of five years. The notification marks the most significant restructuring of Pakistan’s military command since the 1970s.The appointment follows the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment last month, which created the new CDF post to establish a unified command structure and enable faster decision-making in critical situations.The amendment also abolished the office of the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), which had coordinated the tri-services since 1976. The CJCSC post formally ended on November 27 following the retirement of General Sahir Shamshad Mirza.With the restructuring, operational, administrative and strategic authority of the armed forces has been consolidated into a single office headed by the CDF. The revised Article 243 provides that the president, acting on the prime minister’s advice, will appoint the army chief, who will concurrently serve as the CDF.Munir was first appointed Army Chief in November 2022 for three years. His tenure was extended to five years in 2024 after amendments to the Pakistan Army Act.He was promoted to the rank of Field Marshal days after the four-day conflict with India in May, becoming only the second officer in Pakistan’s history to hold the rank after Field Marshal Ayub Khan.Alongside Munir’s notification, the defence ministry also confirmed a two-year extension for Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu. His extended tenure as Chief of the Air Staff will begin in March 2026 and continue till March 2028.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif congratulated Munir on his “historic” appointment, saying his leadership had been pivotal in guiding Pakistan’s armed forces. He also praised the air chief for his command during recent operations. defence minister Khawaja Asif and other senior leaders also extended their congratulations, according to Dawn.Information minister Attaullah Tarar said Pakistan’s defence had strengthened with the establishment of a unified command. Dismissing speculation over the delay in the notification, he said rumours circulating on social and electronic media had proven baseless.Earlier uncertainty had followed the abolition of the CJCSC post and the end of Munir’s original three-year term in late November, leading to political speculation over upcoming four-star appointments. Government officials maintained that the delay was procedural and linked to the prime minister’s travel schedule.Explaining the significance of the new post, army spokesman Lt General Ahmad Sharif Chaudhry said the CDF headquarters would improve coordination across modern, multi-domain warfare involving land, sea, air, cyber, space and intelligence operations. He added that many countries already operate under similar unified command structures.Under the amended military laws, the five-year tenure of the first COAS-plus-CDF is deemed to begin from the date of notification, effectively resetting Munir’s term. The law also allows future reappointments or extensions of up to five years, creating the legal framework for continuity in leadership.The next major step under the new structure will be the appointment of the Commander of the National Strategic Command (NSC), a four-star position responsible for strategic assets. The NSC commander will be appointed by the prime minister on the recommendation of the CDF.Meanwhile, law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said the defence ministry is finalising a new organogram for the CDF to clearly define command flows between the CDF, the service chiefs and the newly created strategic command.Politically, the 27th Constitutional Amendment has drawn mixed reactions. While the ruling coalition hailed it as a step towards efficiency and national security, opposition leaders warned that it concentrates excessive power in the military and could weaken democratic and provincial autonomy.",Pak President Zardari Approves Asim Munir As The First Chief Of Defence Forces.

Pak President Zardari Approves Asim Munir As The First Chief Of Defence Forces Amid Power Tensions





President Asif Ali Zardari on Thursday formally appointed Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir as Pakistan’s first Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) for a period of five years.The move follows the recent passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment on November 12, which created the post of CDF to unify command across the armed forces and streamline decision-making during critical situations.The newly created CDF replaces the abolished office of the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), which formally ended on November 27 following the retirement of General Sahir Shamshad Mirza.President Zardari approved the recommendation submitted by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for Munir’s appointment. A press release from the President’s office extended best wishes to Munir in his new role.The same release also announced a two-year extension in the service of Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmad Babar Sidhu, Chief of Air Staff, effective from the completion of his current tenure in March 2026.Law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said the reforms “bring constitutional oversight to defence appointments while maintaining military honour and tradition” and confirmed there were no legal or political obstacles to Munir’s appointment. He also stated that the Defence Ministry was preparing a new organogram for the CDF to reflect the changes.Field Marshal Munir, who was initially appointed as COAS in November 2022 for three years, had his tenure extended to five years in 2024.With this appointment, he assumes a historic dual role, serving simultaneously as Chief of Army Staff and the first Chief of Defence Forces, marking a significant shift in Pakistan’s military hierarchy and institutional structure.The 27th Constitutional Amendment elevates the army chief to the role of CDF with constitutional authority over all three branches of the military: army, navy and air force.It also introduces judicial reforms, including the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) to handle constitutional matters, allowing the Supreme Court to focus on civil and criminal cases.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the amendment as a demonstration of national unity, highlighting the role of law enforcement in recent counterterrorism efforts.While the ruling coalition including PPP, PML-N, and MQM-P, supported the amendment, opposition parties criticized it as unconstitutional, warning it could concentrate excessive power in the military.PTI chairman Gohar Ali Khan described it as the “Baku Amendments,” accusing the government of undermining democracy. PPP Senator Raza Rabbani warned the changes could damage provincial autonomy and roll back powers devolved under the 18th Amendment, according to Dawn.Following Munir’s appointment, the next key step will be appointing the commander of the National Strategic Command (NSC), a four-star position previously under the CJCSC. The NSC commander will be appointed by the prime minister on the recommendation of the CDF.","President Asif Ali Zardari formally appointed Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir as Pakistan’s first Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) for a period of five years.

'Munir Is A Mentally Unstable Man': Ex-Pakistan PM Imran Khan Blames Army Chief of Fueling Terrorism





Pakistan’s jailed former prime minister Imran Khan on Wednesday launched a sharp attack on the country’s army chief and de-facto ruler Asim Munir , calling him a ""mentally unstable man."" He also claimed that field marshal Munir’s policies were ""disastrous"" for Pakistan and accused him of intentionally ""igniting tensions"" with Afghanistan.The 73-year-old former cricketer-turned-politician shared these remarks on social media a day after his sister, Dr Uzma Khan, met him in Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail. The meeting took place after more than a month, following “special permission” from Shehbaz Sharif ’s government, amid widespread rumours on social media about Imran’s health and safety after he was placed in solitary confinement.In a post on X written in Urdu, Khan said, “Asim Munir’s policies are disastrous for Pakistan. Because of his policies, terrorism has spiralled out of control that grieves me deeply.”He further alleged, “Asim Munir has no concern for Pakistan’s national interests. He is doing all this merely to please Western powers. He deliberately ignited tensions with Afghanistan so that he could be seen internationally as a so-called 'mujahid'.”The PTI founder said he had always opposed “drone attacks and military operations against own people in the country which he said would only fuel more terrorism.”He claimed, “Munir first threatened Afghans, then expelled refugees from Pakistan and carried out drone strikes whose consequences we now face in the form of rising terrorism.”Calling Munir a “mentally unstable man,” Khan alleged that the army chief’s “moral bankruptcy has led to the complete collapse of the Constitution and rule of law in Pakistan.”He also accused Munir of being behind the cases against him and his wife, saying they had been “imprisoned in fabricated cases and subjected to the worst form of psychological torture.”Khan described his prison conditions, saying, “I have been kept in complete solitary confinement, locked inside a cell with no contact with a single human being for four weeks. I was kept entirely cut off from the outside world, and even the basic necessities guaranteed under the jail manual have been taken away from us.”He added that despite court orders, his meetings with political colleagues were stopped, and now even his access to lawyers and family had been cut off. “Pick up any human rights charter, psychological torture is considered 'torture' and is deemed even more severe than physical torture. My sister Noreen Niazi was dragged on the road simply for demanding her legitimate right to meet me,” he said.Khan praised Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi for showing courage during what he called an “environment of repression.” He wrote, “I ask him to continue to play on the front foot. There is no law or Constitution in this country. The law is enforced only against PTI as everyone else is exempt. Those threatening governor’s rule in KP should impose it today rather than tomorrow and then watch what happens to them. ”Speculation about Khan’s health had grown after an undeclared ban was imposed on meeting him. Uzma, after seeing her brother, said his health was “perfectly fine” but he was being subjected to “mental torture in solitary confinement.”“Praise be to Allah! His health is perfectly fine. However, he was very angry and said that they are subjecting him to mental torture,” she said.","Imran Khan says Asim Munir's policies are ""disastrous"" for Pakistan.

NEW DELHI: Imran Khan’s sister on Tuesday said the former Pakistan prime minister is “completely fine” and in good health, after she was finally allowed to meet him inside Adiala Jail following weeks of restricted access that had fuelled protests and rumours about his condition.Authorities at Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail permitted Imran’s sister Uzma Khanum to meet him on Tuesday, breaking a prolonged period during which family members and PTI leaders were repeatedly denied access. According to Pakistan news outlet Dawn, Uzma entered the prison as several PTI supporters gathered outside demanding transparency on Imran’s health.Following the meeting, PTI USA shared her remarks, quoting her as saying, “Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he said that they are subjecting him to mental torture, and that Asim Munir is responsible for all of this.”AccordingUzma said that Imran Khan was kept in his room throughout the day, allowed only limited time outside, and had no communication with anyone. The meeting lasted around 30 minutes, she told the publication.Read more: Can Imran Khan meet visitors in jail?

There has been absolutely no contact with Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Imran Khan , which has intensified speculation about his possible death. Demanding access to the PTI founder, party members have decided to stage a protest despite the restrictions imposed by the Pakistan government.Following the PTI workers' announcement of protests outside the Islamabad High Court and Adiala Jail, Section 144 was enforced in both cities. However, the order has not deterred Imran Khan’s supporters. They declared their protest plans even as restrictions have been in place since November 18 for two months.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Sunday declared that the party would stage a major protest outside the Islamabad High Court on Monday, followed by another demonstration outside Adiala Jail on Tuesday. Speaking at a press conference at the CM House, Afridi claimed that Imran Khan, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder, has been held in “complete isolation” since November 4, with no one granted access to him.He said that Khan’s sisters, senior party leaders, lawyers, and even doctors have all been barred from meeting him, effectively placing him in total solitary confinement—a situation he described as “extremely alarming.”PTI leaders have been demanding access to the party founder, Imran Khan. After KP CM Afridi ordered the party members to immediately move to Islamabad, the party has also asked the supporters to gather outside the Adiala Jail later.Talking to reporters, Afridi said that on Tuesday, all parliamentarians would first gather at the IHC to stage a strong protest before the court’s chief justice, noting that despite judicial orders, he himself was not allowed to meet Khan.“This is blatant contempt of court. We will hold a protest at the IHC,” Afridi asserted.He said the parliamentarians would then move to Adiala Jail to attempt to meet Khan and to express solidarity with his sisters.Following the announcement of protests, the Rawalpindi deputy commissioner's office issued the notice on Monday that Section 144 shall be imposed in the city from December 1 to December 3. According to the notice, the order has been enforced on the basis of “imminent threats” identified by the district intelligence committee (DIC), particularly in and around sensitive installations, major roads and other critical infrastructure. The committee’s assessment underpinned the local government’s decision to restrict public gatherings during this period.The Rawalpindi notification prohibits all kinds of gatherings of more than five people. As per the statement, ""All kinds of Assemblies, Gatherings, Sits-in, Rallies, Processions, Demonstrations, Jalsas, Dharnas, Protests and such like other activities, i.e gathering of 05 or more persons.""""Carrying of weapons, spikes, laden batons, gaulails, ball bearings, petrol bombs, improvised explosives or any other instrument that could potentially be used for violence,"" is also listed as one of the restrictions in the notice.Along with these, pillion riding and the use of loudspeakers or display of ""arms and hatred speeches"" are also prohibited.The Islamabad district magistrate’s office issued the order after what it described as “certain segments of society … planning to organise unlawful assemblies … within the jurisdiction of Islamabad Capital Territory,” according to a report in Dawn. The announcement in Rawalpindi came through a notification from the deputy commissioner’s office, which cited security concerns due to potential large gatherings.In Islamabad, the order did not define what would constitute an “unlawful assembly” but noted that authorities deemed it “necessary to control such types of illegal activities which present a threat to public peace, tranquillity and maintenance of law & order.”Pakistan’s former Prime Minister has remained completely out of sight for more than six weeks, with neither his party members nor his family able to establish any direct contact during this period. His prolonged absence from public view has intensified anxiety across the country, fuelling widespread speculation and deepening fears about his safety.The lack of verified updates or appearances has further heightened concerns, with many questioning whether the politician-turned-cricketer may have become the target of a possible assassination attempt or is otherwise being kept in undisclosed conditions.Khan’s sons fear authorities may be hiding “something irreversible” about his condition. His son, Kasim Khan, told Reuters that the family has had no direct or verifiable contact with the jailed former Prime Minister, despite a court order allowing weekly meetings.“Not knowing whether your father is safe, harmed, or even alive is psychological torture,” he said, noting that there has been no independently confirmed communication for months.“We have no reliable information about his condition,” he added. “Our deepest fear is that something irreversible is being kept from us.”Khan’s sister, Aleema Khan, filed a contempt of court petition in the IHC on November 28 against the Adiala Jail superintendent and other officials, alleging they prevented her from meeting her brother.Submitting the petition in the presence of Chief Minister Afridi, she cited the IHC’s March 24 order, which had restored a twice-weekly visitation schedule for the 73-year-old former prime minister.Pakistan government officials have rejected rumours that Imran Khan has died in custody or been quietly moved out of Adiala Jail, insisting he remains inside the Rawalpindi facility and is in stable condition.“There is no truth to claims of his transfer from Adiala Jail. He is in good health and receiving full medical care,” Geo News quoted Rawalpindi prison officials as saying.Imran Khan is currently being held in Adiala Jail, where a court first handed him a three-year prison term in August 2023 in the Al-Qadir Trust case. Since then, successive corruption convictions have pushed his total sentence to 14 years, the longest jail term imposed on him so far.","Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leaders have been demanding access to the party founder, Imran Khan. KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi claimed that Imran Khan has been held in “complete isolation” since November 4. Khan’s sisters, senior party leaders, lawyers, and even doctors have all been barred from meeting him.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125710838,imgsize-1508415,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

In a first, the Baloch Liberation Front (BLF) used a woman fidayeen operative to storm a heavily-guarded complex belonging to the Frontier Corps and housing a Chinese copper and gold mining project center located in Chagai, Balochistan. Six Pak personnel were reportedly killed in Sunday evening’s attack but there was no official word from the Pak authorities.The BLF also released the photo of the bomber, Zareena Rafiq aka Trang Mahoo, who detonated herself at the barrier to allow the rebel fighters to breach the main compound. The attack is significant because it is the first time the BLF has used a suicide bomber, a tactic exclusive to Majeed Brigade of the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) which has carried out a series of attacks including the Jaffar Express hijack in the region.The fact that the complex was linked to the Saindak and Reko Diq projects, managed by Chinese companies and a Canadian firm, indicates the change in rebels’ strategy to strike high-value assets with geopolitical significance, sources said. In a statement released on Telegram, the BLF spokesperson Gwahram Baloch said that the Fidayeen operation was carried out by its ‘selfsacrifice’ unit, Saddo Operational Battalion (SOB), named after Martyred Commander Waja Sado aka Sadath Marri.Meanwhile the BLA released a statement on the wave of coordinated attacks carried out at multiple locations between Nov 28-29, claiming 27 Pak army personnel were killed in 29 attacks.

Pakistan Rages At UN After Criticism Of Munir’s Immunity Amendment Amid Fears Of Deeper Militarism

Author and National Security Advisory Board (NSAB) member Tilak Devasher claimed that Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is “intentionally” staying out of the country to avoid being present when the notification would be issued for the appointment of the first-ever Chief of Defence Forces (CDF).Created through the 27th amendment to Pakistan’s constitution, the post is set to be assumed by Field Marshal Asim Munir, potentially making him the most powerful army chief in the country’s history.Speaking to ANI, Devasher highlighted that Sharif left for Bahrain and then London, leading to speculation that he's ""deliberately"" staying away to avoid issuing the notification.“Very smartly, the Pakistan PM went to Bahrain and then to London. He clearly does not want to issue the notification giving Asim Munir five years as army chief and as Chief of Defence Forces. He seems to believe that by staying away and avoiding signing the notification, he can escape the consequences,” said Devasher, author of four books on Pakistan.The comment comes after Sharif’s government failed to issue the required notification appointing Munir as the first-ever CDF by the November 29 deadline—the day his original three-year term as army chief ended.With the creation of the CDF post, the office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee has formally been abolished.Devasher added that Pakistan is currently navigating a “very messy” situation.“If it turns out that he (Asim Munir) is no longer the army chief, then Pakistan finds itself without an army chief, and even the nuclear command authority—meant to fall under the new Strategic Forces Command—is effectively leaderless. It’s an extremely strange situation,” he remarked.Legal experts remain divided over whether the notification is necessary. Under the amended Constitution, the Chief of Army Staff’s term is meant to run concurrently with the CDF, lasting five years.Some analysts, however, argue that the issue may already be addressed by the Pakistan Army Act’s 2024 amendment, which extended the tenure of service chiefs to five years, according to Dawn. The amendment includes a “deeming” clause stating it “shall always be deemed to have been part of the Pakistan Army Act,” implying that Munir’s current term could automatically extend from three to five years without any additional notification.Devasher, however, called this interpretation “controversial,” questioning the view that a notification may not be required.“Some people argue that the Army Act was amended in 2004, setting the army chief’s tenure at five years. Since he has already served three, he supposedly has another two years remaining. From this perspective, no new notification would be required. This is controversial, and it’s unclear how the judiciary or the government will view it. But the fact remains that it makes his position very tenuous,” Devasher said.He also pointed to what he described as political manoeuvring within the military. “There are reports that other generals are now jostling for the position of army chief or for the two newly created four-star posts,” he stated.Devasher added that Prime Minister Sharif’s absence is only deepening the uncertainty. “But this situation cannot continue,” he warned. “A nuclear-armed country cannot function without a Chief of the Army Staff or someone in charge of the nuclear command authority.”","Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is ""intentionally"" staying out of the country to avoid being present when the notification would be issued for the appointment of the first-ever Chief of Defence Forces.
