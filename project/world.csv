What is The Resistance Front (TRF)?



The United States on Thursday designated The Resistance Front (TRF), an offshoot of the banned Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) and a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT).The TRF -- the group responsible for the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam that killed 26 people.The US department of state, led by secretary Marco Rubio , said in a statement that TRF is a Lashkar-e-Taiba proxy and front, and that it had claimed responsibility for the Pahalgam attack.The statement said the group has also carried out multiple assaults on Indian security forces, including as recently as 2024.""Today, the Department of State is adding The Resistance Front (TRF) as a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) and Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT).

The department of state also reaffirmed the FTO status of Lashkar-e-Tayyiba.The Resistance Front was formed in 2019 as a proxy of Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and was banned by the central government in 2023.It has been actively involved in recruiting youth online, facilitating the infiltration of terrorists, and smuggling weapons and narcotics from Pakistan into Jammu and Kashmir.TRF had also claimed responsibility for several attacks targeting civilians, political leaders, and security forces in Jammu and Kashmir. Its founder and commander, Sheikh Sajjad Gul, has been designated a terrorist under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967.According to security agencies, TRF’s operations are backed by Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), which uses the group as part of its strategy to keep the Kashmir region unstable.The April 22 attack, carried out in the Baisaran Valley, a popular tourist destination often called ""mini Switzerland"" -- is being described as the worst terror strike on civilians in Kashmir since the 2019 Pulwama bombing.","The Resistance Front (TRF) is an offshoot of the banned Lashkar-e-Tayyiba.

Two other Pakistani terrorists were members of the squad.Satellite phone analysis has revealed that Sulaiman’s location on April 15 was in Tral forest, indicating he was in the vicinity of the attack site at Baisaran for almost a week before the incident. Sulaiman was also involved in the April 2023 attack on an Army truck in Poonch, in which five soldiers were killed. However, he laid low for the next two years, before carrying out the ISI-LeT mission.Sources did not reveal the identities of the two other Pakistani terrorists who selectively gunned down the 26 civilians — all men and 25 of them being Hindus.There are currently about 68 foreign terrorists and three local terrorists active in the Valley. Only one local terror recruitment has been reported so far this year.","The US Department of State on Friday designated The Resistance Front (TRF) as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO) and a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) The state department said the decision reflected the Trump administration’s ""commitment to protecting US national security, countering terrorism, and enforcing President Trump's call for justice following the Pahalgam attack""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122683606,imgsize-449979,width-400,resizemode-4/122683606.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The external affairs ministry on Thursday cautioned against ""double standards"" while pushing back against the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) chief's threat of possible secondary sanctions on India for maintaining trade ties with Russia.""We have seen reports on the subject and are closely following the developments. Let me reiterate that securing the energy needs of our people is understandably an overriding priority for us,"" the MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal, said during the weekly media briefing in Delhi.Further, warning against ""double standards"", Jaiswal said, ""In this endeavour, we are guided by what is available in the markets and also by prevailing global circumstances. We would particularly caution against any double standards on the matter.""The external affairs ministry's comments come after Nato chief Rutte, during a press conference in Washington alongside US Senators Thom Tillis and Jeanne Shaheen, urged India, China, and Brazil to reconsider their economic ties with Moscow or face ""100 per cent secondary sanctions"" if Russia does not commit to peace talks.Rutte echoed the position taken by American President Donald Trump, who earlier this week threatened severe tariffs on countries maintaining trade with Russia.""My encouragement to these three countries, particularly, is that if you live now in Beijing or in Delhi, or you are the President of Brazil, you might want to take a look at this because this might hit you very hard,"" Rutte had said.He further appealed to these nations to pressure Russia into talks. ""Please make the phone call to Vladimir Putin and tell him that he has to get serious about peace talks, because otherwise this will slam back on Brazil, on India and on China in a massive way,"" he warned.The statement follows Trump's announcement on supplying Ukraine with additional military aid, including air defence systems, missiles, and ammunition, largely funded by European allies. Trump also gave Russia a 50-day deadline to enter serious peace negotiations or face full secondary sanctions.","MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal warns against ""double standards"" Comes after Nato chief Mark Rutte urged India, China, and Brazil to reconsider their economic ties with Moscow or face ""100 per cent secondary sanctions"" if Russia does not commit to peace talks.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122639166,imgsize-877568,width-400,resizemode-4/122639166.jpg"

'Time For Revival...': Russia's Big Unity Call To Rivals India & China | 'RIC Troika Will...'

(With inputs from agencies)

BEIJING/NEW DELHI: China on Thursday expressed its support for Russia’s initiative to revive the dormant Russia-India-China (RIC) troika.Russian news portal Izvestia on Thursday quoted Russia’s deputy foreign minister Andrei Rudenko as saying that Moscow expects the resumption of the RIC format and is negotiating on this issue with Beijing and New Delhi.“This topic appears in our negotiations with both of them. We are interested in making this format work, because these three countries are important partners, besides being the founders of BRICS,” Rudenko said.“Therefore, the absence of this format, in my opinion, looks inappropriate. In this regard, we expect that the countries will agree to resume work within the framework of the RIC — of course, when relations between these states reach a level that allows them to work in a trilateral format,” he said.In India, the ministry of external affairs said RIC is a consultative format where the three countries discuss global issues and regional issues of interest to them. “As to when this particular RIC format meeting is going to be held, it is something that will be worked out among the three countries in a mutually convenient manner,” said the spokesperson.Asked for his reaction to Rudenko’s comments, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian on Thursday said, “China-Russia-India cooperation not only serves the respective interests of the three countries but also helps uphold peace, security, stability and progress in the region and the world.”China stands ready to maintain communication with Russia and India on advancing the trilateral cooperation, he said.The Russian and Chinese interests in the revival of RIC followed the recent visit of foreign minister S Jaishankar to China to take part in the SCO foreign ministers meeting, during which he held talks with his Chinese and Russian counterpaerts Wang Yi and Sergei Lavrov.Joint work in the RIC format was stalled, first because of the Covid pandemic and then by the India-China military standoff at eastern Ladakh in 2020.","Russia's deputy foreign minister Andrei Rudenko says Moscow expects the resumption of the RIC format.

BENGALURU: In a faux pas, Meta’s auto-translation tool “digitally” killed off Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah while translating a condolence message posted by CMO on social media Tuesday. Understandably furious at being referred to as “late” CM, Siddaramaiah told Meta to suspend its Kannada auto-translation feature until it learns not to distort facts.The condolence message was posted in Kannada on Facebook and Instagram, mourning the death of veteran actress B Sarojadevi. Meta’s English auto-translation, however, read: “Chief Minister Siddaramaiah passed away yesterday multilingual star, senior actress B. Took darshan of Sarojadevi’s earthly body and paid his last respects.”Reacting sharply to the goof-up, Siddaramaiah posted on X: “Faulty auto-translation of Kannada content on Meta platforms is distorting facts and misleading users. This is dangerous when it comes to official communication. My media adviser has formally written to Meta urging immediate correction. Social media platforms must act responsibly.I caution citizens to be aware that translations shown are often inaccurate. Such negligence by tech giants can harm public understanding and trust.”The CMO said it sent a mail to Meta, seeking urgent intervention. The CMO also urged Meta to hit pause button on Kannada auto-translation until it improved the feature further. It also asked the tech company to collaborate with Kannada language experts and professionals “to enhance contextual accuracy” of translations from Kannada to English”.“We have noted with concern that the auto-translation from Kannada to English is frequently inaccurate and, in some cases, grossly misleading,” wrote K V Prabhakar, the CM’s media adviser. Prabhakar cautioned that such bloopers could cause confusion, especially when they involve public communication, official statements or important messages from the CM or govt. “Many may not realise that what they are reading is an automated translation rather than the original message,” he said.","The condolence message was posted in Kannada on Facebook and Instagram, mourning the death of veteran actress B Sarojadevi.

CHENNAI: Take legal action against those preventing a person from entering a temple because of his or her caste, Madras high court has directed authorities, stressing that caste-based discrimination cannot be permitted in a country governed by the rule of law.Petitioner Venkatesan moved the court after idols installed by people belonging to scheduled caste (SC) at Ayyanar temple in Pudukudi village in Ariyalur’s Udayarpalayam taluk were vandalised by dominant caste members. He alleged that members of SC were being forced to have a darshan of the deity from behind a large iron gate.“If a temple is permitted to be visited by the public, it assumes the character of a public temple. In such an event, irrespective of the caste or community of the devotees, they must be permitted to offer their prayers to god,” justice N Anand Venkatesh ruled.Recording the submissions, Justice Venkatesh said, “There shall be a direction to district SP and RDO to ensure that all classes of Hindus are permitted to enter the temple and participate in the festival.”",Petitioner Venkatesan moved the court after idols installed by people belonging to scheduled caste (SC) at Ayyanar temple in Pudukudi village were vandalised.

'Blunder at gates'

Poor security arrangement due to cops-organisers nexus

Standard protocols bypassed: Karnataka govt

BENGALURU: The one-man judicial commission constituted by Karnataka’s govt to probe the June 4 stampede outside Bengaluru’s Chinnaswamy stadium that claimed 11 lives has held Royal Challengers Sports Pvt Ltd (RCSPL), which owns and runs RCB, event organisers DNA Entertainment, Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) officials and senior police officers responsible for the tragedy.The Justice D’Cunha Commission found that the organisers failed to obtain mandatory prior permissions — seven days before the event, as required under the Licensing and Controlling of Assemblies and Processions (Bengaluru City) Order, 2009.Meanwhile in the high court, the state govt argued that police officers handling the situation on the day of the stampede had acted like “servants of RCB management”.The Justice John Michael D’Cunha commission, which submitted its report recently, has recommended legal action against three from KSCA: Raghuram Bhat (president), A Shankar (former secretary), and ES Jairam (former treasurer); RCSPL vice-president Rajesh Menon; two from DNA: T Venkata Vardhan (MD) and Sunil Kumar (VP); three IPS officers: B Dayananda, Vikash Kumar Vikash, Shekhar T Tekkannavar; and two more from police department: C Balakrishna and AK Girish.The commission found that the organisers failed to obtain mandatory prior permissions — seven days before the event, as required under Licensing and Controlling of Assemblies and Processions (Bengaluru City) Order, 2009.Pointing out that police security arrangement was grossly inadequate and ineffective, the panel said senior cops were working on ‘bandobast’ under direct command of additional DGP and commissioner of police, “in nexus” with organisers, even before any formal security activation took place.“Out of 515 personnel deputed, only 79 were posted outside the gates to control the crowd. Even these officers were not visible at the venue during the crisis,” it noted.Control room staff failed to alert on-ground security teams stationed at the entry gates. Despite clear signs of overcrowding, the exit gates were not opened in time, which the commission termed “a serious act of negligence and a breakdown of emergency protocols”.The report also flagged improper and unscientific installation of barricades, combined with narrow and constricted entry gates, as a major contributing factor. Under-deployment of police at high-risk gates made the situation worse.It concluded that the organisers themselves triggered the stampede by failing to regulate entry and by making reckless announcements about stadium access.The situation, the commission said, was the result of “hasty decisions and lack of preparation, amounting to recklessness bordering on gross negligence”.The “who is responsible for the stadium stampede” debate took an interesting turn in Karnataka HC on Thursday with the state govt alleging that police officers handling the situation on the day of the tragedy had “acted like servants of RCB management”. However, a suspended IPS officer countered it saying that govt made him a scapegoat.Vikash Kumar Vikash had challenged govt’s decision to suspend him in Central Administrative Tribunal (Bengaluru branch), which recently quashed his suspension and ordered his reinstatement. Referring to CAT’s move, govt told HC that CAT had exceeded its authority by conducting an unnecessary fact-finding mission whilst handling his petition.Special advocate PS Rajagopal, representing govt, noted that police officers acted without proper requisition from RCB management as if they were servants of the entity. Regarding the tribunal’s decision to exonerate Vikash and advise the govt to extend the relief to four other officers, he said it had overstepped its jurisdictional boundaries.He highlighted the unprecedented events of June 3 and June 4, where RCB hastily invited people without proper procedures. He pointed out that police arrangements were made despite lacking necessary permissions, bypassing standard protocols for venue inspection and safety assessments.","The one-man judicial commission has held Royal Challengers Sports Pvt Ltd (RCSPL), which owns and runs RCB, event organisers DNA Entertainment, Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) officials and senior police officers responsible for the tragedy.

Gunmen kill murder convict in Patna hospital,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gunmen-kill-murder-convict-in-patna-hospital/articleshow/122693726.cms,"5 men gun down Chandan Mishra in ICU

No arrests yet, but some men detained for Patna shooting: SP

PATNA: Five men, each carrying a pistol, strolled into a room in a top private hospital here Thursday morning and shot dead a murder convict undergoing treatment on parole and fled without encountering any resistance, the impunity of the execution triggering fresh alarm in a city reeling from a string of killings this July. The last gunman didn’t bother to run; he swaggered off, CCTV footage showed.Chandan Mishra, 36, of was serving a life sentence at Beur central jail for the 2011 murder of a businessman. He was recovering from liver surgery at Paras HMRI Hospital on Bailey Road. His parole was to end July 18.Around 7.15am, CCTV footage captured five men with pistols approaching Room 209 on the hospital’s second floor and firing at close range.Their faces were clearly visible in the footage, now circulating widely on social media. Mishra died of multiple gunshot wounds.A case has been registered. Forensic and canine units were sent to the scene. The body has been sent for autopsy. “Some people have been detained for questioning, but no arrests have been made yet,” Patna SP (central) Diksha said.Mishra had over two dozen cases against him. His 2011 conviction was tied to the murder of businessman Rajendra Kesari.Police said he often declared his intentions openly and had told Kesari, “I will kill you tomorrow,” after he refused to pay extortion money. Kesari was gunned down the next day.Patna SSP Kartikeya K Sharma said preliminary evidence pointed to gang rivalry. “There was a gang called Chandan-Sheru. The manner of shooting suggests a targeted hit by a rival group, possibly over personal enmity or gang war,” he said.Mishra had teamed up with Omkarnath, alias Sheru Singh, to form the Chandan-Sheru gang, which dominated organised crime in western Bihar. Their rise prompted police crackdowns and Rs 50,000 bounties on both men. Power struggles over money and leadership eventually split the gang, with Sheru forming his own faction. Both had clashed when they were inmates at Bhagalpur jail.","Chandan Mishra, 36, of was serving a life sentence at Beur central jail for the 2011 murder of a businessman.

NEW DELHI: Brutality of offence cannot be the sole criterion to award death punishment and mitigating circumstances, including socio-economic background and psychological state of the convict, must also be considered, Supreme Court has said while commuting the death sentence of two convicts in two different cases. It condemned them to spend the rest of their lives in jail without the possibility of remission.Though trial courts and high courts in both cases had awarded death, a bench of Justices Vikram Nath, Sanjay Karol and Sandeep Mehta commuted the sentences and granted them life sentences with the condition that they have to die in jail.In one case, the convict from Ballari district in Karnataka had killed his wife, three children and sister-in-law in 2017 due to suspicion that he was not the biological father of the children and they were born out of infidelity. In the other case, a daily wage earner had raped and strangulated a 10-year-old girl in 2018 in Dehradun.The court held that in both cases, trial court and HC decided the punishment on the basis of barbaric and ruthless manner of committing the crime and mitigating circumstances were not considered. “Courts below have only commented on the brutality of crime in question, to hand down the death penalty to the appellant. No other circumstance came to be discussed by the courts in reaching the conclusion that the case forms part of the ‘rarest of rare’ category. Such an approach in our view cannot be sustained,” it said.","Brutality of offence cannot be sole criterion to award death punishment, Supreme Court says.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court rescued a young man, who impulsively eloped with a college girl and stayed together at Hyderabad for two months but for the next 13 years the man faced the rigour of police investigation and later, was concurrently convicted of kidnapping and rape by the trial court and the Telangana HC.A bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and Sandeep Mehta acquitted the man of all charges on finding that the couple were in a consensual relationship and had eloped on their own volition. The trial court had convicted and sentenced him to seven years rigorous imprisonment, which was reduced to two years by the HC.The man had eloped with his friend’s sister on Aug 4, 2012, and the couple stayed at Shadnagar, Hyderabad. The girl’s mother had on Aug 8 lodged a missing complaint with police. On Oct 12, the man met with an accident while riding his motorcycle and was admitted to hospital. On that day the girl returned to her parental home. On her statement, the police lodged an FIR for kidnapping and rape against the man.Analysing the evidence produced before the trial court, the bench said, “The girl’s deposition does not demonstrate that the man forcibly removed or enticed her from the guardianship of her parents with deceit or inducement.She admits having voluntarily accompanied the man on a motorbike on Aug 4, 2012. SC wondered as to why the girl’s mother waited for four days to lodge a missing complaint and said the girl living willingly and without protest with the man for two months generates doubts over the kidnapping theory of the police.The bench said when the man was hospitalised after the accident, she remained with him for two days. On rape charge, it said, “This charge has no legs to stand on, for she only makes a positive statement about the occurrence of sexual intercourse and does not even in the slightest imply the same to be against her will.”Acquitting him of all charges, Justices Karol and Mehta said, “We do not find any evidence which may suggest that the appellant kidnapped the victim from lawful guardianship or confined her, for approximately two months, against her volition in a house at Hyderabad or had sexual intercourse with the victim against her will or without her consent.”","A bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and Sandeep Mehta acquitted the man of all charges on finding that the couple were in a consensual relationship. The man had eloped with his friend’s sister on Aug 4, 2012, and the couple stayed at Shadnagar, Hyderabad.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122680388,imgsize-29228,width-400,resizemode-4/122680388.jpg"

The 'Late' Show: End of an era as CBS cancels Trump critique's Stephen Colbert's popular show,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/the-late-show-end-of-an-era-as-cbs-cancels-trump-critiques-stephen-colberts-popular-show-here-is-why/articleshow/122721244.cms,"Stephen Colbert (AP image)





CBS has announced that it will end 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert' in May 2026, marking the network’s exit from late-night television. The decision, which CBS says is based on financial concerns, comes despite the show being one of the highest-rated programs in the late-night slot.The cancellation has drawn significant attention, especially as it follows a recent legal settlement between CBS’s parent company, Paramount and President Donald Trump . That settlement, combined with Paramount’s upcoming merger with Skydance Media, has raised questions about Colbert’s future particularly given his outspoken criticism of Trump.In his return to the show earlier this week, Colbert condemned the Paramount's settlement with Trump, comparing it to a ""big fat bribe.""CBS however, have issued a statement emphasizing that the show’s cancellation is purely due to financial challenges and not related to the show’s content, performance or politics.Paramount, which owns CBS, laid off 3.5% of its workforce last month. A source close to the network confirmed that falling advertising revenue has made The Late Show unprofitable, as reported by CNN.Colbert shared the news with his audience during a taping on Thursday evening.“Next year will be our last season,” he said. “The network will be ending our show in May. It’s the end of The Late Show on CBS.”The audience was visibly shocked upon hearing the announcement, while some observers immediately raised concerns about Paramount’s motivation.US Senator Adam Schiff, who was a guest on Thursday’s show, wrote in a post on X, “If Paramount and CBS ended The Late Show for political reasons, the public deserves to know. And deserves better.”Colbert expressed gratitude toward CBS and the show’s audience, saying,“I’m so grateful to the Tiffany network for giving me this chair and this beautiful theater to call home. And of course, I’m grateful to you, the audience, who have joined us every night in here, out there, all around the world.”“The Late Show” has been a popular franchise of CBS for over three decades. Originally hosted by David Letterman , who launched the show in the 1990s, it became known for its “Top Ten” lists and quirky segments. Colbert took over in 2015 and brought a sharp edge political humour to the show, especially after Trump’s 2016 election.Colbert’s sharp critiques of Trump helped the show top the late-night ratings, giving CBS its strongest performance in the slot in two decades. He has remained a vocal critic during Trump’s second term, even as CBS faced legal pressure from the president.CBS previously ended 'The Late Late Show' with James Corden in 2023 due to financial concerns. Colbert helped produce a much less expensive replacement show, “After Midnight” which also concluded earlier this year. CBS said that the show ended because its host, Taylor Tomlinson, did not want to host another season.","CBS has announced that it will end 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert' in May 2026.

Epstein scandal: Trump orders release of ‘any and all’ case files; Pam Bondi vows ‘ready to move the court’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/epstein-scandal-trump-orders-release-of-any-and-all-case-files-pam-bondi-vows-ready-to-move-the-court/articleshow/122723946.cms,"



Amid mounting pressure from both Democrats and Republicans, US President Donald Trump has ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to release “any and all” grand jury testimony related to Jeffrey Epstein The new Epstein files could refer to more secret witness statements, evidence, and court proceedings from past criminal investigations into Epstein’s sex trafficking network, reigniting public attention on the long-running scandal involving powerful and wealthy figures.“Based on the ridiculous amount of publicity given to Jeffrey Epstein, I have asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval,” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform. “This SCAM, perpetuated by the Democrats, should end, right now!”Bondi, a close ally and legal adviser to Trump, confirmed her readiness to act. Reposting Trump’s Truth Social message on X, she wrote, “President Trump — we are ready to move the court tomorrow to unseal the grand jury transcripts.”This development comes as Trump strongly denies a Wall Street Journal report that claims his signature appears in a letter found in Epstein’s 2003 birthday album. The Journal says the leather-bound book, compiled by Ghislaine Maxwell for Epstein’s 50th birthday, contains messages from influential associates and includes a typed letter signed “Donald” inside the outline of a naked woman.Trump rejected the letter as a forgery and has threatened legal action against the Wall Street Journal, NewsCorp, and Rupert Murdoch.“This is not me. This is a fake thing. It’s a fake Wall Street Journal story,” Trump told the WSJ. “I never wrote a picture in my life. I don’t draw pictures of women. It’s not my language. It’s not my words.”Trump also said he warned the Journal not to publish the story, stating, “I’m gonna sue The Wall Street Journal just like I sued everyone else.” In another Truth Social post, he criticised editor Emma Tucker, writing, “The Editor of The Wall Street Journal, Emma Tucker, was told directly by Karoline Leavitt, and by President Trump, that the letter was a FAKE, but Emma Tucker didn’t want to hear that.”Leavitt, who is also White House press secretary, doubled down, saying, “The WSJ refused to show us the letter and conceded they don’t even have it in their possession when we asked them to verify the alleged document they’re basing their ENTIRE fake story on.”WSJ described the letter as a third-person note written in Trump’s voice and ending with the line: “A pal is a wonderful thing. Happy Birthday – and may every day be another wonderful secret.”US vice presient JD Vance slammed the article as false. “Forgive my language but this story is complete and utter bulls—,” he wrote on X. “The WSJ should be ashamed for publishing it.”Trump claims the allegations are part of a broader political plot. He accused the Democrats, Barack Obama, Joe Biden, and former FBI director James Comey of being behind a “Jeffrey Epstein hoax,” and suggested they should be investigated by the FBI.The article was published shortly after prosecutor Maurene Comey — daughter of James Comey and part of the Epstein-Maxwell investigations — was reportedly dismissed from her role.Trump has repeatedly denied any improper links to Epstein and claims he cut ties with the disgraced financier long before Epstein’s 2008 conviction. Epstein died by suicide in a Manhattan jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year sentence for her role in recruiting underage girls.","US President Donald Trump has ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to release “any and all’ grand jury testimony related to Jeffrey Epstein.

MAGA move: Trump admin axes LGBTQ youth suicide hotline; critics warn ‘kids will die’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/maga-move-trump-admin-axes-lgbtq-youth-suicide-hotline-critics-warn-kids-will-die/articleshow/122711335.cms,"(Photo: AP)





The Trump administration has stopped a special phone service that helped LGBTQ kids and young adults with mental health problems. This move has upset many people, including Democrats, doctors, and LGBTQ rights groups.This service was part of the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. It let callers under 25 talk to trained counsellors who understand LGBTQ issues. NBC News reported that the government shut it down.The service started in October 2022. It was known as the “Press 3” option. People could press 3 or text the word “PRIDE” to speak to someone who could really understand them. Since it began, nearly 1.5 million people have used it.The government agency SAMHSA said last month it would no longer keep this special line just for LGBTQ kids. They said they want to help all callers in the same way.Jaymes Black, the head of The Trevor Project, which helped run the service, said stopping it was “unfathomable.” He told NBC: “This administration has made a dangerous decision to play politics with real young people’s lives. Sadly, more children are going to die in America because of this cut.”People from both political parties were upset. Democrat Rep. Seth Moulton said on MSNBC: “Kids are going to die.This is actually the kind of thing Republicans should care about if they really care about American kids.”He also said: “As a veteran, I know how much it means to my fellow veterans to be able to push a button when they call 988 and get connected directly to a veterans crisis counsellor. Well, LGBTQ kids need that, too.”Republican Mike Lawler agreed. At a press event, he said, “Cutting a programme that is working, that is meeting a real and growing need, just does not make sense.”SAMHSA explained that the LGBTQ youth service had no more funding from Congress. They said if they kept it, they would have to remove help from other parts of the 988 hotline. The veterans’ option to press 1 is still available.California governor Gavin Newsom reacted quickly. He said California will now work with The Trevor Project to train 988 crisis workers to understand LGBTQ youth better. He said, “While the Trump administration continues its attacks on LGBTQ kids, California has a message to the community: we see you and we’re here for you.”If LGBTQ youth need help, they can still contact The Trevor Project.","Service was part of the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.

'No gringo is going to give orders': Brazil's Lula slams US president over 50% tariff; claims Trump is 'not the emperor of the world',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-gringo-is-going-to-give-orders-brazils-lula-slams-us-president-over-50-tariff-claims-trump-is-not-the-emperor-of-the-world/articleshow/122701384.cms,"



Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Thursday hit back at US President Donald Trump ’s move to impose a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports, saying Brazil would not bow to foreign pressure and warning of reciprocal action.Lula expressed his disapproval, saying, “No gringo is going to give orders to this president,” according to news agency Reuters. He made the remarks during an event with leftist student activists in the state of Goias, wearing a red shirt and defending Brazil’s sovereignty.His comments followed a letter from Trump posted on his social media platform, Truth Social, in which the US leader blamed the tariffs on Brazil’s treatment of right-wing ex-president Jair Bolsonaro and accused the country of unfair trade practices against American companies. The tariffs are due to take effect from August 1.Speaking to anchor Christiane Amanpour in an interview, Lula called Trump’s comments a break from diplomatic protocol and argued that the judicial process involving Bolsonaro had nothing to do with trade policy, CNN reported. “The judiciary branch of power in Brazil is independent. The president of the Republic has no influence whatsoever,” he said.Lula also said that Trump was elected as the leader of the United States and “not to be the emperor of the world,"" reports CNN.Bolsonaro is currently on trial in Brazil for allegedly attempting to stage a coup following Lula’s 2022 electoral win. He could face more than 40 years in prison if convicted.Lula even compared the situation to Trump’s own legal troubles, saying, “If Trump was Brazilian and if he did what happened at Capitol Hill, he’d also be on trial in Brazil. And possibly he would have violated the Constitution. According to justice, he would also be arrested if he had done that here in Brazil.”Initially, Lula said he believed Trump’s post was fake. “It was very unpleasant,” he told CNN. “I thought it was fake news.”The Brazilian government has vowed to respond with reciprocal tariffs if Trump follows through. “Brazil is to take care of Brazil and take care of the Brazilian people, and not to take care of the interests of the others,” Lula said. “Brazil will not accept anything imposed on it. We accept negotiation and not imposition.”The situation marks one of the first strong pushbacks to Trump’s recent wave of tariff threats. Over 20 other countries have received similar letters this month, but Brazil stands out due to its significant trade relationship with the US.Lula, who is in his third non-consecutive term as president, also reiterated his government’s intention to regulate and tax foreign tech companies. “We are going to regulate and tax US tech firms,” he said, blaming them for promoting violence and misinformation “under the argument of freedom of expression.”Brazil’s foreign relations minister Mauro Vieira said there had been no direct communication between Lula and Trump so far, but confirmed Lula was open to talks. “If the circumstances are given, they will speak,” Vieira said, as reported by CNN Brasil.Furthermore, Lula indicated a willingness to find common ground. “The best thing in the world is for us to sit around a table and talk,” he told CNN. “If President Trump is willing to take seriously the negotiations underway between Brazil and the US, then I’ll be open-minded to negotiate whatever may be necessary.”Meanwhile, tensions escalated further as the US announced an investigation into what it called “unfair” trade practices by Brazil. According to the United States Trade Representative (USTR), the probe will focus on issues including digital trade, electronic payments, tariffs, corruption, and intellectual property rights.Lula is expected to deliver a televised address to the nation later on Thursday, in which he is likely to elaborate on Brazil’s stance and outline possible next steps in the growing trade dispute.At home, the political tension seems to be working in Lula’s favour. His approval ratings have recently seen an uptick as many Brazilians support his firm stand in defending national interests.",Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva hit back at US President Donald Trump.

Conspiracy allegations







Donald Trump has threatened to sue The Wall Street Journal over its report on a letter allegedly bearing his signature in Jeffrey Epstein’s 2003 birthday album, calling the document “fake. ”The leather-bound album, created for Epstein’s 50th birthday, has resurfaced in public discussion after the Journal claimed it reviewed a copy that included the letter attributed to Trump. The album was reportedly organised by Ghislaine Maxwell and featured personal messages from several of Epstein’s prominent associates.The contents of the album are under renewed scrutiny amid recent US justice department investigations into Epstein and Maxwell, who were convicted for operating a decades-long sex trafficking ring that exploited underage girls through manipulation, abuse, and a network of powerful connections.In an interview with WSJ on Tuesday, Trump denied writing the letter or drawing the figure. “This is not me. This is a fake thing. It’s a fake Wall Street Journal story,” he said. “I never wrote a picture in my life. I don’t draw pictures of women. It’s not my language. It’s not my words.”He also warned the paper against publishing the article. “I’m gonna sue The Wall Street Journal just like I sued everyone else,” he reportedly said.On Thursday, Trump further expressed his frustration and posted on his Truth Social account, condemning WSJ. He attacked the editor directly, saying: “The Editor of The Wall Street Journal, Emma Tucker, was told directly by Karoline Leavitt, and by President Trump, that the letter was a FAKE, but Emma Tucker didn’t want to hear that. Instead, they are going with a false, malicious, and defamatory story anyway.”The MAGA chief seemed very sure of suing WSJ. ""President Trump will be suing The Wall Street Journal, NewsCorp, and Mr. Murdoch, shortly. The Press has to learn to be truthful, and not rely on sources that probably don’t even exist,"" he said.According to The Wall Street Journal, the page attributed to Trump features several lines of typewritten text framed by the outline of a naked woman, drawn in thick black marker.The Journal report says: “A pair of small arcs denotes the woman’s breasts, and the future president’s signature is a squiggly ‘Donald’ below her waist, mimicking pubic hair.”The note is allegedly styled as an imaginary third-person conversation between Trump and Epstein. It ends with the line: “A pal is a wonderful thing. Happy Birthday – and may every day be another wonderful secret.”The origins of the letter remain unclear, and it is not known how the version bearing Trump’s signature was produced, according to WSJ.The document was reportedly stored alongside birthday messages from other Epstein acquaintances.Following the publication of the article, US vice president JD Vance slammed the piece in a post on X, writing: “Forgive my language but this story is complete and utter bulls—.” He added, “The WSJ should be ashamed for publishing it. Where is this letter? Would you be shocked to learn they never showed it to us before publishing it? Does anyone honestly believe this sounds like Donald Trump?”In another Truth Social post, Trump asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to take action, writing: “Based on the ridiculous amount of publicity given to Jeffrey Epstein, I have asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to produce any pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval. This SCAM, perpetuated by the Democrats, should end, right now!”White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt further pressed on the matter. In a post on X, she condemned WSJ's actions: ""The WSJ refused to show us the letter and conceded they don’t even have it in their possession when we asked them to verify the alleged document they’re basing their ENTIRE fake story on.""""When has President Trump ever spoken like the conversation alleged in the fake WSJ story? That’s not at all how he speaks or writes, "" she said.Trump lashed out at businessman Rupert Murdoch as well.""The Wall Street Journal printed a FAKE letter, supposedly to Epstein. These are not my words, not the way I talk. Also, I don’t draw pictures. I told Rupert Murdoch it was a Scam, that he shouldn’t print this Fake Story. But he did, and now I’m going to sue his a** off, and that of his third rate newspaper. Thank you for your attention to this matter! DJT""Speaking to reporters, Trump suggested that parts of the Epstein files may have been fabricated by Democrats, including former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden and ex-FBI Director James Comey.“I can imagine what they put into files,” Trump said, later referring to the Epstein revelations as part of “the Jeffrey Epstein hoax” and calling for the FBI to investigate what he described as a criminal conspiracy against him.The Journal’s article was published shortly after the dismissal of Maurene Comey from the US Attorney’s Office in Manhattan. Comey, daughter of former FBI director James Comey, had previously helped lead the prosecutions of Epstein and Maxwell.Trump has long denied close ties to Epstein, stating that he cut off their friendship before Epstein’s 2008 conviction for soliciting a minor.

Trump’s Body Raising Red Flags? FIFA World Cup Photos Reveal POTUS’ ‘DISTURBING’ Condition





The White House Thursday announced that President Donald Trump has been diagnosed with a chronic but benign vein condition amid ongoing speculations over his bruised hand . The White House said the president sought a medical examination for swollen legs which came up with the new finding.""I know that many in the media have been speculating about bruising on the president's hand and also swelling in the president's legs. In the effort of transparency, the president wanted me to share a note from his physician ... all results were within normal limits,"" White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said.""Recent photos of the president have shown minor bruising on the back of his hand. This is consistent with minor soft tissue irritation from frequent hand-shaking and the use of aspirin,"" Leavitt said. Leavitt said Trump decided to share the note on his new health diagnosis with everyone. The president underwent a thorough evaluation after noticing swelling in his lower leg. The condition is benign and common among individuals over the age of 70. Leavitt announced that there is no evidence of deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease.Explaining the bruises on Trump's back of hand, Karoline explained that this is because of minor soft tissue irritation due to frequent hand shaking and the use of aspirin which Trump takes as part of standard cardiovascular prevention regimen.The clarification from the White House came as a close-up of Trump's hand became the center of online chatter as his hand looked evidently bruised. The theory of handshaking was floated earlier too but it was dismissed by many experts.Dr Neal H Patel, a doctor at Providence St Joseph Hospital, told the Daily Mail earlier this year that shaking hands is unlikely to have caused the damage. “I see a lot of patients who are businessmen, and I’ve never really seen them getting bruising from too much handshaking,” he said. “I guess it’s possible, but that would really not be on my list of ideas of what causes it.”",The White House said the president sought a medical examination for swollen legs which came up with the new finding.

MUMBAI: Maharashtra govt will take legal action and implement measures against some ‘Crypto-Christians’ who are allegedly exploiting their official Hindu and reserved caste status to secure educational, employment and electoral benefits, CM Devendra Fadnavis told the legislative council on Thursday.Responding to a calling attention motion by MLC Amit Gorkhe, Fadnavis said the issue was serious and warranted strict action.

Their true religion is often revealed only during funerals,” Gorkhe said in the Upper House.“This practice is particularly rampant in districts like Nandurbar, Sangli and Ahmednagar. Due to such deceit, the truly deserving and marginalised groups in Maharashtra are deprived of reservation benefits and govt facilities,” he said.Fadnavis cited an apex court judgment which states that SC reservations apply only to Hindus and religions closely aligned with Hinduism, like Sikhism and Buddhism, but not to other faiths.“If we find violation of this order, the person will face punishment, and their validity or caste certificate will be cancelled,” he said.He added that if someone had secured a govt job using this “modus”, departmental action would be taken along with the cancellation of their caste certificate. Similar action would apply to those contesting elections too.Fadnavis hinted the state is considering an anti-conversion bill. A committee has submitted its report, and a decision will soon be taken. However, he clarified the govt does not intend to ban voluntary religious conversions.","Devendra Fadnavis said the issue was serious and warranted strict action.

'Gu-NDA Raj': Cong, RJD Lambast Nitish Govt Over Bihar Law & Order After Patna Hospital Shooting





PATNA: The killing of convicted gangster Chandan Mishra inside Paras HMRI on Patna's Bailey Road has raised serious concerns over the facility's security and surveillance systems. Five unmasked assailants reached the second floor, opened fire on Mishra, who was out on parole for medical treatment and fled the premises within 30 seconds.Patna inspector general Jitendra Rana said the hospital's security arrangements, including visitor screening protocols, were under review. ""The mandatory frisking of all people entering the premises raises questions about the potential involvement of security staff with the attackers. The police will question the on-duty personnel to understand how the armed assailants gained access to the facility,"" he said.Bihar director general of police, Vinay Kumar, said around three dozen cases had been registered against Mishra, who was being treated at Paras HMRI. ""It is now a matter of investigation how the assailants got inside the hospital premises. It is a very well-known hospital. For security, the hospital management has also engaged a retired DSP-rank officer,"" he said.""Security guards are stationed there and even as a common person, if you go, there are several checkpoints and you cannot go beyond the main gate. So, it is a matter of investigation how the criminals managed to reach the room where he was admitted without any intervention. This will be thoroughly investigated. In the CCTV footage that has emerged, the criminals are visible and they have been identified. They will be arrested soon,"" the DGP added.Patna senior superintendent of police Kartikeya K Sharma told TOI that the attackers may have conducted a recce prior to the shooting.""One of the associates went to the hospital earlier for treatment and was aware of the frisking zones. The criminals were not checked at any security point, which is under investigation. It seems hospital security may have been involved. The medical officer who was on duty is being questioned,"" he said.""The accused avoided the lift usually used by attendants and instead accessed the building through a rear staircase. Before entering the lift, the attendant pass is checked, and there is proper security. But the accused involved in the crime used the staircase from behind, which is not widely known. This suggests they did a recce. They reached the room directly and carried out the crime,"" a member of the hospital staff said on condition of anonymity as he is not authorised to talk to media.On the question of whether security personnel were assigned to Mishra during his parole, Beur jail superintendent Neeraj Kumar Jha said a police escort was not typically deployed for regular parole. ""He was already convicted. There are two types of parole – one for three days with police security — emergency parole — and the other regular. His parole began on July 3 and he was due to return to jail on July 18,"" Jha said.",Convicted gangster Chandan Mishra was killed at Paras HMRI in Patna.

TALLINN: A snappy tune by a blogger that mockingly laments his poor internet connection in the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don has gotten over a half-million views on Instagram in two weeks.""How to say you're from Rostov without saying a word? Show one bar of cellphone service,"" Pavel Osipyan raps while walking around the city, smartphone in hand. ""We have internet until 12 o'clock, and recently there's been no connection at all. No need to be angry, just get used to it already.""The complaints by Osipyan - unable to pay electronically for groceries, or having to use paper maps while driving - aren't isolated to Rostov-on-Don, which borders Ukraine and, as home to Russia's Southern Military District, is targeted frequently by drones.In the last two months, cellphone internet shutdowns, which officials say are needed to foil Ukrainian drones, have hit dozens of Russian regions - from those near the fighting to parts of Siberia and even the Far East. Some Wi-Fi outages also have been reported.Russians contacted by The Associated Press talked about card payments not going through, taxi and ride-sharing apps not working properly, ATMs that sometimes fail.Experts point to the unprecedented nature of the measures and warn of far-reaching consequences in a country where the Kremlin already has significantly curtailed online freedom.Such shutdowns in the name of security legitimize them to the public and open the door for authorities abusing the restrictions, said Anastasiya Zhyrmont, policy manager for Eastern Europe and Central Asia at the Access Now digital rights group.A signal to regional authorities Experts say the trend began in May, when Russia celebrated the 80th anniversary of the defeat of the Nazi Germany in World War II and foreign dignitaries flocked to Moscow for a big military parade.The capital suffered severe disruptions of cellphone connectivity to the internet for days, and Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed those were deliberate restrictions due to regular Ukrainian drone attacks. Asked how long they'd last, he replied, ""This will be done as needed.""Russia has restricted smartphone connectivity before, with isolated instances during protests, as well as in regions bordering Ukraine.Shutdowns in the capital, however, sent a signal to authorities across the vast country that it's a useful tool, said lawyer Sarkis Darbinyan, founder of Russian internet freedom group Roskomsvoboda.Ukraine's ""Operation Spiderweb"" in early June, in which drones launched from containers on trucks attacked airfields deep inside Russia, made officials all the more eager to take action, Darbinyan said.""They got really scared that drones now may appear, like a jack-in-the-box, in any Russian regions,"" he told AP.By mid-July, deliberate shutdowns spread to most of the country, according to Na Svyazi - Russian for ""staying connected"" - an activist group tracking internet availability.On Tuesday, the group reported cellphone internet shutdowns in 73 of over 80 regions. In 41 of them, there were reports of broadband network outages as well, while restrictions on broadband internet occurred in six regions, while cellphone connections were fine.Some regional officials confirmed that cellphone internet was restricted for security reasons. Nizhny Novgorod Gov Gleb Nikitin said this month the measure will stay in place in the region east of Moscow for ""as long as the threat remains.""Asked Thursday whether such mass shutdowns were justified, Peskov said ""everything that has to do with ensuring the safety of citizens, everything is justified and everything is a priority.""Unpredictable disruptions Russians from affected regions say the outages can last for hours or days; patterns also are hard to discern, with service working in one part of a city but vanishing elsewhere.In Voronezh, near Ukraine and frequently targeted by drones, one resident said she felt like she was in ""a cave"" in early July with no cellphone internet or Wi-Fi in her home. The woman, who spoke to AP on condition of anonymity because of security concerns, said she was only able to get online at work the next day.Cellphone internet in the southwestern city of Samara ""goes out at the most unpredictable moments,"" said Natalia, who also spoke on condition that her last name be withheld for safety reasons. Her home Wi-Fi recently also has slowed to a near halt around 11 pm, staying that way for a few hours, she said.Connectivity has improved recently in the Siberian city of Omsk, said Viktor Shkurenko, who owns retail stores and other businesses there. But cellphone internet service was out in his office for an entire week. A few of his smaller stores that rely on cellphone networks suffered disruptions, but nothing critical, he said.""I don't feel any super strong discomfort,"" said Grigori Khromov of Nizhny Novgorod, Russia's fifth-largest city where regular and widespread shutdowns were reported. ""I have an office job and I work either at home or in the office and have either wire internet or Wi-Fi.""In rural areas, small towns and villages, where cellphone internet often is the only way to get online, the situation was harder to gauge.Pharmacies in such areas have struggled, Russian media reported and the Independent Pharmacies Association confirmed to AP. Viktoria Presnyakova, head of the association, said in a statement that prescriptions must be logged in special software, but that becomes impossible without an internet connection for weeks.A social media user in the Belgorod region bordering Ukraine complained on Gov Vyacheslav Gladkov's social media page that without cellphone internet and a working alarm system, village residents have to bang on a rail to warn neighbours of an attack. The authorities promised to look into improving connectivity in the area.Authorities elsewhere also announced steps to minimize disruptions by opening Wi-Fi spots. They also are reportedly planning to establish an agency to coordinate the shutdowns, according to Izvestia, a Kremlin-backed newspaper that cited unidentified government sources. Peskov said he was unaware of the plan.Russia's efforts at internet control Russian and Ukrainian drones use cellphone internet networks to operate, so shutdowns are one way authorities try to counter the attacks, said Kateryna Stepanenko, a Russia analyst at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War.But it's also part of the Kremlin's long-term effort to rein in the internet. Authorities have actively censored online content in the last decade, blocking thousands of websites of independent media, opposition groups and human rights organizations.After Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the government blocked major social media like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, as well as encrypted messenger platform Signal and a few other messaging apps.Access to YouTube - wildly popular in Russia - was disrupted last year in what experts called deliberate throttling by the authorities. The Kremlin blamed YouTube owner Google for not properly maintaining its hardware in Russia.State internet watchdogs routinely block virtual private network services that help circumvent the restrictions, and there are plans to introduce a national messenger app, expected to replace foreign ones.Along with the shutdowns, these are part of a larger campaign ""to establish control over the internet, which is something the Kremlin had failed to do 20 years prior on the same level that China did,"" said the ISW's Stepanenko.Access Now's Zhyrmont says it's ""very disturbing"" that Russians have gotten used to living with growing internet restrictions, including shutdowns.""This shouldn't be modern reality,"" she said.","In the last two months, cellphone internet shutdowns have hit dozens of Russian regions. Officials say the shutdowns are needed to foil Ukrainian drones. Experts point to the unprecedented nature of the measures and warn of far- reaching consequences.

Donald Trump's environmental rollback: Provides regulatory relief to coal-fired plants; reverses Biden era rules to 'national security',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/donald-trumps-environmental-rollback-provides-regulatory-relief-to-coal-fired-plants-reverses-biden-era-rules-to-national-security/articleshow/122714749.cms,"US President Donald Trump is planning to reverse environmental regulations introduced during the Biden administration, announcing two years of regulatory relief for coal-fired power plants, chemical manufacturers and other industrial polluters.The decision, framed as a national security measure, was revealed through a series of presidential proclamations issued late on Thursday.The exemptions apply to a broad range of facilities, including taconite iron ore processors critical to steel production, and chemical manufacturers involved in making semiconductors and sterilising medical devices. These industries will now be permitted to comply with older Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards that were in effect prior to the Biden-era rules, the White House confirmed.Trump criticised the regulations imposed under President Joe Biden as prohibitively expensive and, in some cases, impossible to meet. A White House fact sheet claimed the exemptions would allow “critical industries can continue to operate uninterrupted to support national security without incurring substantial costs.”During his previous term, Trump’s EPA had already granted waivers to numerous coal-fired plants, citing similar reasons.The agency also gave polluting industries a chance to apply for relief from rules aimed at limiting emissions of hazardous chemicals such as mercury, arsenic and benzene. To streamline the process, the EPA introduced a dedicated email system that companies could use to seek presidential exemptions under the Clean Air Act.Environmental groups have strongly condemned the move, branding the new EPA contact point a “polluters’ portal” that could enable widespread avoidance of environmental laws. Advocates warned of the dangers associated with exposure to toxic substances, especially mercury, which can lead to brain damage in children and birth defects in unborn babies.Industry associations representing hundreds of chemical and petrochemical firms quickly mobilised to request blanket exemptions from federal pollution controls. Under the Clean Air Act, the president has authority to grant such temporary exemptions if required technologies are not broadly available and the exemptions serve national security interests.Back in April, the EPA granted 70 coal-fired plants a two-year reprieve from federal mandates targeting toxic emissions. According to a list published on the agency’s website, 47 power providers operating at least 66 coal plants have already received exemptions from Biden-era regulations.In a broader push, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced in March an ambitious plan to repeal dozens of major environmental regulations covering air, water and climate protections. Zeldin hailed the move as the “most consequential day of deregulation in American history.”However, news agency AP warned of the potential consequences. as the targeted regulations could have prevented an estimated 30,000 deaths and saved $275 billion annually.“Today’s actions provide much needed regulatory relief for the power sector and help ... unleash American energy,"" Zeldin said.","US President Donald Trump is planning to reverse environmental regulations introduced during the Biden administration.

Trump Battling THIS Chronic Disease After Months of Online Speculation, Official Report Drops





President Donald Trump on Wednesday sidestepped a direct question about whether he would appoint a special counsel to investigate the Jeffrey Epstein case, saying, “I have nothing to do with it,” according to CNN.The following day, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reinforced Trump’s position, telling reporters that the president does not support appointing a special prosecutor in the matter, despite mounting pressure from some Republican leaders.“The president would not recommend a special prosecutor in the Epstein case. That’s how he feels,” Leavitt said during a White House press briefing on Thursday (local time). She added that she was “not sure” whether Trump had discussed the idea of a special counsel with Attorney General Pam Bondi.The power to appoint a special counsel lies with the attorney general and the department of justice, which generally functions independently of the White House to safeguard against political interference.However, Trump has often disregarded this practice. He has previously called for investigations into his political opponents.In March, during a speech at the department, he proclaimed himself as the “chief law enforcement officer in our country”, a title usually reserved for the attorney general.In contrast, Trump has taken a more cautious public approach regarding the Epstein investigation. He has stated that it is up to Attorney General Bondi to release any credible information related to the case. When asked on Thursday whether Trump would order the release of all Epstein-related files, Leavitt responded that the matter was “out of the president’s control.” She also said she was not aware of whether Trump had been briefed by Bondi on any unreleased details.“Not to my knowledge, and that’s a question for the attorney general,” Leavitt said.Last week, the department of justice released an unsigned memo stating there was no evidence that Epstein maintained a “client list” or that he was murdered. This announcement angered many of Trump’s supporters, particularly after Bondi had previously hinted that such a list existed. She later clarified that she had been referring to other documents related to the investigation.Despite the DOJ’s statement, public skepticism has grown, especially among Trump’s base, with increasing demands for transparency. On Wednesday, Trump dismissed ongoing concerns about the case, describing those focused on the Epstein files as “weaklings” who have fallen for a “hoax.”Some of Trump’s allies have publicly disagreed with the administration’s stance. Trump’s aide Laura Loomer told Politico that a special counsel should be appointed to independently investigate the handling of the Epstein files. She also criticized Bondi for lacking transparency and for not handling the issue effectively.Republican Lauren Boebert also called for a special counsel. In an interview with podcaster Benny Johnson she said, “I think moving forward, we need a special counsel. That has got to happen. There has to be a special investigation into this if we aren’t going to be provided information.”In an interview with John Solomon that aired Wednesday, Trump linked the Epstein case to other investigations that have targeted him. He said the FBI could examine all of them together.“I think they could look at all of it. It’s all the same scam. They could look at this Jeffrey Epstein hoax also, because that’s the same stuff,” Trump said.","White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Thursday that the president does not support appointing a special prosecutor in the Epstein case.

Austrian sportsman Felix Baumgartner, 56, also known as “fearless Felix” has lost his life in a paragliding accident in Italy, as per local media.Baumgartner reportedly was feeling unwell before takeoff and lost control of his aircraft on Thursday around 4.00 pm (local time) in Porto Sant'Elpidio, Marche. He reportedly crashed the craft into a hotel swimming pool, reports the New York Post.A woman was also injured in the incident after being hit by Baumgartner as he fell to the ground. She was transported to Murri Hospital, though initial reports indicate her injuries are not serious.Baumgartner departed from Fermo, but while flying along the coast, he lost control of the powered hang glider for reasons still under investigation. Following the crash, he lost consciousness and went into cardiac arrest, reports the Daily Mail.Emergency responders called for an air ambulance to transport him to the Torrette Hospital, in Ancona but he was pronounced dead at the scene.Around two hours before the deadly crash he posted a story on his Instagram that read “too much wind.”“Our community is deeply affected by the tragic disappearance of Felix Baumgartner, a figure of global prominence, a symbol of courage and passion for extreme flight,"" said the city's mayor Massimiliano Ciarpella, through a social media post.Baumgartner’s daring jump in 2012 from a capsule over 39 kilometres (24 miles) above Earth cemented his place in the record books as an extreme adventurer. Baumgartner achieved the fastest freefall on record, reaching a top speed of 1,357.6 kilometers (843.6 miles) per hour after jumping from the capsule, reports AFP.He set a world record in 1999 for the highest parachute jump from a building by leaping off the 1,483-foot-tall Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.He also became the first person to skydive across the English Channel in 2003.""I always had the desire to be in the air,"" Austrian media quoted him saying.

An Indian-origin physician, Sanjay Mehta, pleaded guilty to unlawfully prescribing opioids, including to two poeple who fatally overdosed. He admitted that he procured the opioids by fraud. The 57-year-old man from West Virginia's Shady Spring pleaded guilty to three counts of obtaining a controlled substance by fraud after he admitted to unlawfully prescribing opioids while working at HOPE Clinic, a pain management clinic, according to a news release from the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of West Virginia.Prosecutors said Mehta worked at multiple sites that the pain management clinic operated from November 2012 through May 2015 though he had “little to no experience in dealing with chronic pain patients and no training in prescribing Schedule II narcotics.”Mehta admitted to writing prescriptions for three different customers with no legitimate medical purpose, including prescriptions for oxycodone, methadone and Roxicodone. Prosecutors said two of the three patients died of opioid intoxication within days of receiving their prescriptions.Mehta is scheduled to be sentenced on October 31 and faces a maximum of four years in prison, up to three years of supervised release and a maximum $750,000 fine.He also agreed to surrender his Drug Enforcement Administration Certificate of Registration, not oppose the revocation of his registration to dispense controlled substances and not apply for re-registration.Mehta was initially indicted in 2018 along with others associated with HOPE Clinic and Patients, Physicians and Pharmacists Fighting Diversion, which managed HOPE Clinic’s daily operations. According to the indictment, from November 2010 to June 2015, Mehta and his associatesconspired to distribute oxycodone and other Schedule II controlled substances outside the usual course of professional practice.Mehta and six other physicians pleaded guilty to separate charges in lieu of the indictment. PPPFD owner-operator Mark T. Radcliffe, 68, of Shady Spring and co-defendant Michael T. Moran, 60, of Covington, Virginia, are scheduled for trial on Oct. 6, 2025.HOPE Clinic operated in Beckley, Beaver and Charleston, West Virginia, and Wytheville, Virginia.“It is readily evident that the Southern District of West Virginia has been severely impacted by the opioid crisis. The United States Attorney’s Office is committed to bringing to justice those whose criminal conduct contributes to this crisis and worsens its most tragic consequences,” said acting US attorney Lisa G.

Who is Maurene Comey?





The US justice department has fired Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor in Manhattan and the daughter of the former FBI director James Comey, on Wednesday. The reason for her firing was not immediately clear.Comey had worked on several high-profile cases, including the prosecution of financier Jeffrey Epstein as well as rapper Sean “Diddy” Combs.Reacting to the firing, Maurene Comey said there was no reason behind her dismissal. “Yesterday was unexpectedly my last day in the Office. I was summarily fired via memo from Main Justice that did not give a reason for my termination,” she wrote in an email to colleagues, reported the New York Post.This comes as the administration is embroiled in a controversy after closing the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein.Maurene Comey was a seasoned attorney in the Southern District of New York, widely regarded as one of the Justice Department's most prestigious prosecutorial offices.She famously worked on the prosecution of financier Jeffrey Epstein, who died in custody in 2019, as he was awaiting trial.Comey achieved significant success in several high-profile prosecutions, most notably securing the conviction of Ghislaine Maxwell on sex trafficking charges for assisting financier Jeffrey Epstein in the abuse of underage girls.In a declaration submitted in January, Comey argued that releasing documents on the Epstein case could harm the government’s position on a potential retrial of Maxwell. She said that making the materials public might expose witnesses “to possible embarrassment and harassment” potentially discouraging them from testifying, as per the New York Times.Most recently, Comey led the prosecution of Sean “Diddy” Combs. The trial against Combs ended in a split verdict and he was convicted on prostitution related charges but acquitted of more serious charges.In recent months, Comey came under repeated attacks from Trump’s right-wing base, including Laura Loomer, a far-right political activist, who urged attorney general Pam Bondi to fire her in May.","Maurene Comey, the daughter of former FBI director James Comey, was fired on Wednesday.

New video shows Travis Decker 3 days before he allegedly killed his daughters





Newly acquired video footage from the Wenatchee police department shows Travis Decker, 32, the fugitive father, accused of killing his three young daughters, just days before their disappearance.The footage captures Decker speaking with a police officer and another individual on May 27. Decker rear-ended another vehicle at a red light, and the second person in the video was the driver of that car, reported CBS News.In the nearly 20-minute-long video, Decker and the other person were seen speaking to each other and the officer. Towards the end of the video, Decker and the other driver shook hands before returning to their respective vehicles. The audio could not be intercepted from the clip.The driver whose car Decker had hit said that he was “nervous and fidgety” and kept on asking him to “not call the police,” as per KING 5. “I could tell he was not in his full senses,” the driver added.Travis Decker has been the subject of an intense manhunt since June 2 after officials found the bodies of three of his daughters, Paityn (9), Evelyn (8), and Olivia (5), at a campground near Leavenworth, Washington State.The girls were on a “planned visitation” with Decker on May 30. Decker’s vehicle was found abandoned near the girls’ bodies and officials announced that the bloody handprints on the truck’s tailgate matched the DNA profile of Decker's.As per court records, Decker’s ex-wife raised concerns over his mental health, highlighting that he became increasingly unstable and was often living out of his truck. She also mentioned that he had been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder but was not under any medication.Decker served in the US Army from 2013 to 2021, including a deployment to Afghanistan in 2014, and received training in navigation, survival, and wilderness skills. Police stated that he is currently wanted on three counts of first-degree murder and three counts of kidnapping.A probable cause affidavit revealed that Decker fled the scene of a different crash on May 4, although the other driver declined police follow-up since their vehicle was undamaged.","New video shows Travis Decker 3 days before he allegedly killed his daughters.

TOI correspondent from Washington:

Asim Munir for President? Pakistan Defence Minister Denies Amid Buzz Of Asif Ali Zardari Quitting





A political and diplomatic dogfight is underway over a prospective visit to Pakistan by US President Donald Trump en route to the Quad summit in India in September amid a gradual recalibration of ties in the region.Pakistani business leaders and influencers are working overtime to convince the White House of a Trump visit after pulling off a coup by arranging a luncheon meeting last month for the country's army chief Asim Munir with the US President.Munir charmed Trump by endorsing him for a Nobel Peace Prize, playing up to his craving for one, and the Pakistanis are now promising the US President more honors and trade access if he visits, despite having thrown itself at China's feet for survival.Although the White House has not confirmed Trump's Quad attendance given New Delhi is yet to nail the dates -- which also depends on the leaders of Japan and Australia -- Pakistan's excitable media broadcast that the US President would visit Pakistan on September 18, before retracting the report because Trump will be on a state visit to the UK from September 17-19.There are indications though that Trump may stopover in Pakistan whenever he heads out to the Quad summit.This could be as late as November given the MAGA supremo's obsession with trade deals over strategic alignments. He has just delivered a tariff shock to Japan and also riled up Australia, while India has proved to be a tough negotiator, frustrating his trade boffins attempts to strong-arm New Delhi into a quick deal.In fact, Trump's fetish for tariffs and his fixation on trade deals puts a question mark over the strategic salience of the Quad even as long-time allies and partners adjust to his mercurial approach.According to some diplomats, India itself may have to reassess its approach to Trump-era Washington after a rosy-eyed view of long-term strategic ties with the US. They acknowledge that Trump’s response during his second term to the Pakistani outreach – driven more by opportunism than any strategic vision – clearly caught India off guard. New Delhi resents the re-hyphenation that would be implicit in such a two-fer, but has no way of thwarting it.If Trump does visit Pakistan, it will be the first US Presidential trip to the country in nearly two decades after George W Bush layover in 2006. Bush stopped by in Islamabad for a few hours under a tight security blanket on his way back from a three-day visit to New Delhi, talking up counter-terrorism cooperation with Pakistan while rejecting its pleas for a nuclear deal similar to the one he forged with India.Presidents Obama and Biden both disdained even a stopover while Trump himself trashed Pakistan during his first term, accusing it of ""nothing but lies & deceit"" and providing ""safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan.""Pakistan is now promising to turn itself into a safe haven for US businesses promoted by Trump associates -- including transforming Islamabad into the ""crypto capital of South Asia"" and a ""global leader in the digital finance revolution,’ -- to land a Presidential visit.During his first term, Trump is famously said to have complained about landing in Iraq and Afghanistan with the lights on Air Force One turned off (as a security measure), despite the US having spent billions on the countries. If the Pakistan stopover comes through, he may well insist on landing in full sight – to soak up the fanfare and flattery.","Pakistani business leaders and influencers are working overtime to convince the White House of a Trump visit.

BLA spokesperson Jeeyand Baloch stated that civilians, including qawwali performers on board, were not intended targets, though Dawn reported three civilian deaths, including two qawwals.In another incident, the BLA claimed to have killed two soldiers and injured seven with a remote-controlled IED in Quetta’s Hazarganji area.The Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF) also announced two separate operations.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan said on Monday it was creating a national paramilitary force, prompting concern among opposition parties and human rights groups that it could be used as a tool of political repression.The move turns an existing paramilitary force deployed on Pakistan’s northwestern border with Afghanistan into a national security force that will be called the Federal Constabulary, state minister for the interior Talal Chaudhry told a press conference in the eastern city of Faisalabad. Its new duties will include internal security, riot control and counter-terrorism, according to a copy of the amended law reported by the local Dunya News TV.The announcement came after Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party of former jailed PM Imran Khan said it would stage nationwide protests starting on Aug 5, the second anniversary of his arrest. Several such protests since his Aug 2023 arrest have turned violent, in some cases paralysing the capital Islamabad for days.“This will be a new force. This will be a stronger force. We need this force for internal security,” Chaudhry said, adding that President Asif Ali Zardari had already approved amendments in the law introducing changes in the paramilitary force.The new force replaces the Frontier Constabulary (FC), whose cadres were previously recruited only from tribes in the northwestern province, Chaudhry said.Training of the new force will bring it into line with other national law enforcement agencies, he added. Khan’s party spokesperson Zulfikar Bukhari said the changes should be subject to parliamentary discussion.The new force “should not be used as a gimmick to silence political opponents, as has been previously witnessed when the government applied such laws against a large number of the PTI leadership and supporters,” he said. His concern was echoed by Haris Khalique, secretary of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, an independent body. “We are alarmed by the changes being made to the security and law enforcement structure of the country without any debate in parliament,” Khalique said.REUTERS","The move turns an existing paramilitary force deployed on Pakistan’s northwestern border with Afghanistan into a national security force.

A protest over a prolonged power outage in Karachi’s Punjab Colony spiraled into city-wide traffic chaos on Saturday, underscoring what many see as chronic governance failure and energy mismanagement in Pakistan, Dawn reported.Residents of an 80-flat, 10-storey building blocked a major road near Punjab Chowrangi after going more than 24 hours without electricity. Power had reportedly been out since 11 am Friday, and despite repeated complaints, K-Electric, Karachi’s sole power distributor, allegedly failed to respond.The resulting sit-in crippled traffic on Defence Road and nearby areas. Long queues of trucks and tankers vital to Karachi Port were stalled from Qayyumabad to the KPT Flyover. Major intersections like Boat Basin, Gizri, and Hino Chowrangi were brought to a standstill, leaving thousands of commuters stranded, according to Dawn.The outage reportedly followed K-Electric’s anti-theft operation in the adjacent P&T Colony. Protesters claimed legal connections were also cut off in the sweep, with no clear procedure followed. KE, however, described the protestors as ""miscreants"" attempting to restore illegal connections and said their teams were attacked during the operation, allegedly linked to a cable TV network.No evidence was provided implicating all affected residents in theft.While KE later claimed to have restored power to parts of the area, the larger issue remains unresolved. The incident highlights Pakistan’s ongoing struggle to provide reliable electricity, exacerbated by outdated infrastructure and lack of accountability in power distribution.As Dawn noted, the crisis is less about one blackout and more a reflection of systemic dysfunction, where citizens bear the brunt of institutional failure.","Residents of an 80-flat, 10-storey building blocked a major road near Punjab Chowrangi after going more than 24 hours without electricity.

PESHAWAR: An under-construction government primary school for girls in Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province was damaged in an IED blast by unknown militants, police said on Friday.No casualties were reported as the building was unoccupied at the time of the explosion.Militants had planted an explosive material inside the premises of the Azaan Javed Primary School in Baka Khel police jurisdiction of Bannu district.The device was detonated with a powerful blast, causing substantial structural damage to the building.An FIR has been registered and forensic teams have been deployed to collect evidence from the blast site, police said.Authorities have condemned the attack as an attempt to derail educational development in the region.According to a report by the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank, more than 1,100 girls' schools have been destroyed in the tribal areas between 2007 to 2017, with teachers and young students also targeted.Before an all-out military operation launched by Pakistan's security forces in 2014, the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) carried out hundreds of attacks on girls' schools in the tribal areas and settled districts of the northwestern province from its stronghold in Swat district.After the crackdown, TTP militants fled to Afghanistan and began to orchestrate cross border attacks from their new sanctuaries.The Taliban takeover of Kabul has emboldened the TTP, which is fighting to regain control of its strongholds in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Since the takeover of Afghanistan in 2021, the Taliban has banned girls from attending school beyond the sixth grade and banned women from universities.Pakistani Taliban, who are ideologically closer to Afghan Taliban, are trying to enforce a similar anti-education and theocratic agenda in Pakistan's tribal areas by force.The youngest Nobel Prize laureate, Malala Yousafzai, who is from Swat district, was shot in the face when she was 14 by TTP gunmen in 2012 as she wanted to pursue her education.","Militants planted an explosive material inside the premises of the Azaan Javed Primary School.

In a disturbing case, Pakistani actress and model Humaira Asghar Ali was found dead in her Karachi apartment, with forensic experts saying she likely died between eight to ten months ago.Her body was discovered last week by a police team executing a court order to vacate the flat.According to Geo News, which cited the initial post-mortem findings, the body was in an “advanced stage of decomposition.” Facial muscles had deteriorated, fingers and nails were reduced to bone, and large parts of the body had no muscle tissue left. The bones reportedly began to fall apart when touched.Humaira had acted in several television serials and two films. She lived alone in an apartment in the upscale Defence Housing Society.The report also said that her internal organs had turned into a “black-coloured mass” and brain matter was entirely decomposed due to autolysis. Cartilage in the joints was gone, though no bone fractures were found. While the head and spine remained intact, the spinal cord was missing. Brown-coloured insects were reportedly present, especially in the hair, but no maggots were found.Because of the severe state of decay, experts were unable to determine the exact cause of death at this stage. However, DNA profiling and toxicology tests are underway and are expected to offer further insight.Initially, police said that her family refused to take the body. “Her family members have flatly refused to own her or take the body for burial,” DIG South Zone Asad Reza said, adding they claimed to have severed all ties with her two years ago. He said the case posed unusual challenges, especially since her death had gone unnoticed for such a long time and no neighbours appeared to have raised any concerns.Geo News later confirmed that her family received the remains on Thursday and transported them to Lahore by ambulance.","Pakistani actress and model Humaira Asghar Ali was found dead in her Karachi apartment.
