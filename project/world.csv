An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 struck Pakistan in the early hours of Friday, according to the National Centre for Seismology (NCS). The agency said the quake occurred at a depth of 135 kilometres, with tremors recorded at 03:09:12 IST.In a post on X, the NCS said, “EQ of M: 5.2, On: 21/11/2025 03:09:12 IST, Lat: 36.12 N, Long: 71.51 E, Depth: 135 Km, Location: Pakistan.” Officials said more information is awaited.The NCS also shared details of another recent tremor. On Thursday, a magnitude 3.9 earthquake struck Pakistan at a shallow depth of 10 kilometres, making the region susceptible to aftershocks. The agency posted: “EQ of M: 3.9, On: 20/11/2025 17:19:20 IST, Lat: 35.02 N, Long: 71.63 E, Depth: 10 Km, Location: Pakistan.”Earlier on November 10, an earthquake of magnitude 3.6 was recorded at 02:42 AM at a depth of 90 kilometres. The NCS said on X, “EQ of M: 3.6, On: 10/11/2025 02:42:55 IST, Lat: 35.20 N, Long: 73.40 E, Depth: 90 Km, Location: Pakistan.”Seismologists note that shallow earthquakes are generally more dangerous because seismic waves have less distance to travel, resulting in stronger ground shaking and greater potential damage.Pakistan lies in one of the world’s most seismically active zones, where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates collide. The region frequently experiences moderate to strong earthquakes, often felt across borders in Afghanistan and northern India.Multiple provinces lie close to major fault lines. Balochistan sits near the active boundary between the Arabian and Eurasian plates. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan fall along the southern edge of the Eurasian plate, while Punjab and Sindh are positioned on the northwestern edge of the Indian plate, making large parts of the country vulnerable to frequent seismic activity.","The quake occurred at a depth of 135 kilometres, with tremors recorded at 03:09:12 IST.

5.7-magnitude earthquake in Bangladesh triggers tremors across Kolkata, northeast

KOLKATA: An earthquake of magnitude 5.7 struck near Dhaka capital of Bangladesh on Friday. The tremors were reported in Kolkata and several parts of Northeast India, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS).The quake struck 13 km south-southwest of Narsingdi in the Bangladesh at 10.08am, and at a depth of 10 km, it said. Several people in Kolkata and other districts were seen coming out on the streets as a precautionary measure.Residents in Kolkata reported brief tremors around 10:10 am, describing them as lasting only a few seconds. Within minutes, videos of the moment began circulating widely on social media.Similar mild tremors were also felt in Guwahati, Agartala and Shillong, according to early reports.There was no immediate report of any injury or damage.In October, Bangladesh experienced a magnitude 3.4 earthquake, according to the National Centre for Seismology (NCS).Shallow quakes like this produce stronger shaking as seismic waves travel a shorter distance to the surface. Globally, earthquakes occur roughly every 30 seconds, though most are too minor to be noticed.Bangladesh sits at the junction of three tectonic plates—the Indian, Eurasian, and Burma plates.The Indian plate moves northeast at about 6 cm per year, while the Eurasian plate shifts north at roughly 2 cm annually.The country is crisscrossed by several major fault lines, including the Bogura, Tripura, Dauki, and Assam faults, as well as the Shillong Plateau, placing it within 13 earthquake-prone zones.High-risk areas include Chattogram, the Chattogram Hill Tracts, and Jaintiapur in Sylhet.Dhaka, with a population density exceeding 30,000 people per square kilometre, is among the world’s densest cities and ranks as one of the 20 most earthquake-vulnerable cities globally, according to The Daily Star.","5.7-magnitude earthquake in Bangladesh triggers tremors across Kolkata, northeast India.

God forbid that anyone gets caught up in a narrative; if someone gets trapped in this labyrinth, it becomes very difficult to get out

NEW DELHI: Former Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar on Friday delivered his first public speech since stepping down from office. Addressing a gathering in Bhopal, he highlighted the importance of fulfilling one’s duties and responsibilities, even in the face of personal constraints citing his recent past as proof.Speaking at the launch of Hum Aur Yeh Vishwa, a book by RSS joint general secretary Manmohan Vaidya, Dhankhar remarked, “In today's time, people are drifting away from morality and spirituality. 'Main flight pakadne ki chinta se apne kartavya ko nahin chhod sakta'. My recent past is proof of it…”Dhankhar also warned against getting caught in a narrative, saying that once you’re stuck, it becomes very difficult to get out, adding that ""I am not giving my example.""“‘Bhagwan kare ki koi narrative ke chakkar mein na fas jaye, iss chakravyuh mein koi fass gaya toh nikalna bada mushkil hain ()’. I am not giving my example,” he said.Both his remarks were met with laughter by the audience.Dhankhar resigned abruptly on July 21, citing health reasons, and had remained out of public view except for a quiet appearance at the swearing-in of his successor CP Radhakrishnan on September 12.His absence from public life had fuelled questions from the Opposition, which repeatedly argued he deserved a formal farewell like his predecessors. Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge alleged that Dhankhar was “forced out” because, after years of “harassing” the Opposition, he “suddenly decided to move by the book”. He claimed the government was angered when Dhankhar admitted notices to remove Justice Shekhar Yadav and Justice Yashwant Varma, saying the prime minister gave him a choice to “withdraw his order or face action”. Kharge argued that Dhankhar chose to resign, recalling how he had suspended a record number of MPs and remarking, “this is their democracy”. Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut and Independent MP Kapil Sibal demanded clarity on Dhankhar’s whereabouts, with Sibal saying he had “never heard of a ‘laapataa vice president’”.Friday’s event was also notable for the absence of government representatives. No one from the Mohan Yadav administration or the state BJP arrived at the airport to receive him, prompting sharp criticism from former chief minister Digvijaya Singh.He accused the ruling party of disregarding protocol, saying the BJP values only those who are “useful” to it and describing its approach as “use and throw”. He added that he would not extend that criticism to the RSS, given Dhankhar had come at the Sangh’s invitation.Organisers said the former vice-president had been scheduled as the keynote speaker for some time, marking his first major engagement since leaving office. Dhankhar, who took charge in August 2022 and was due to serve until 2027, had an eventful tenure that included frequent clashes with the Opposition and an unprecedented impeachment motion that was later dismissed.","Former Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar delivers his first public speech since stepping down from office.

SRINAGAR: A judicial commission set up by the Union home ministry (MHA) to probe the Sept 24 violence in Leh warned Friday that anyone threatening eyewitnesses against deposing would be strictly dealt with.The commission, headed by retired Supreme Court judge BS Chauhan, had revealed last month that it was not getting good response and information on the violence that saw security forces in Leh allegedly open fire on protesters demanding statehood and Sixth Schedule status for the Union territory. Four people died and over 90 were injured.“There are several instances where people are being threatened and told not to depose. If anyone has been threatened, they should write to the commission. If someone is afraid to come forward, we will keep their identity confidential,” Rigzin Spalgon, joint secretary of the commission, said on Friday. He urged eyewitnesses to come forward and “speak freely” before the commission.Spalgon’s statements followed a notice on Thursday in which the commission warned of legal action against anyone “interfering, deterring, obstructing or hindering” witnesses.Evidence can be submitted till Nov 28, after which the commission will start hearings.The MHA had announced the commission after demands from Leh Apex Body (LAB) and Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA), Ladakh’s two major political organisations. Both had made the panel’s formation a precondition for resuming dialogue with the Centre. Climate activist and LAB member Sonam Wangchuk was among the over 70 people arrested over the violence, which was followed by a clampdown that included curfew-like restrictions and internet blocks.Other than Chauhan, the commission has retired district judge Mohan Singh Parihar as judicial secretary and IAS Tushar Anand as administrative secretary. The ministry later expanded the panel by including Spalgon, a Ladakhi, on demands from LAB.After the probe commission was announced, the Centre resumed talks with LAB and KDA on Oct 22 in New Delhi. The talks, earlier held with a committee headed by junior Union home minister Nityanand Rai, had been called off by the Ladakh groups following the violence.","The commission, headed by retired Supreme Court judge BS Chauhan, had revealed last month that it was not getting good response and information on the violence that saw security forces in Leh allegedly open fire on protesters.

Al-Falah engineer who chose path of terror; accused in multiple blasts between 2007 and 2011,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/before-the-docs-an-al-falah-engineer-chose-path-of-terror/articleshow/125469900.cms,"Before the docs, an Al-Falah engineer chose path of terror

ED Cracks Down On ‘White-Collar Terror Module’, Conducts 25 Raids Linked To Al-Falah University

NEW DELHI: On a chilly winter night in 2005, Mirza Shadab Baig, an engineering graduate, moved into a dingy room in southeast Delhi's Zakir Nagar.The next two years witnessed the formation of what was called the notorious ‘Azamgarh module' of Indian Mujahideen (IM) and the transformation of Baig into a notorious and radical jihadi.His ruthlessness can be gauged from the fact that during the Delhi serial blasts in 2008, he is said to have specifically targeted a children's park near India Gate.While bombs exploded at Karol Bagh, Connaught Place and Greater Kailash, the one planted by Baig at the park was detected in time and defused.Now presumed to be somewhere along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, Baig's name has cropped up with his alma mater, Al-Falah University, in the spotlight in connection with the Nov 10 explosion near Red Fort.Baig, an accused in multiple blasts in India between 2007 and 2011, got his bachelor's degree in engineering from the Faridabad university in 2007, investigators looking into last week's blast, said on Thursday.The son of a doctor from Azamgarh, Baig initially worked with HCL Infosystems in Noida. However, along with Asadullah Akhtar and Ariz Khan, his classmates from Jyoti Niketan school in Azamgarh, Baig eventually chose the path of terror after being radicalised.Once Baig moved to Zakir Nagar, he met Atif Ameen of Batla House infamy, who lived in nearby Shaheen Bagh. A police charge sheet details how this meeting changed the course of life of not only Baig, but also Akhtar and Khan. Ameen made them listen to speeches of Jaish-e-Muhammed founder Maulana Masood Azhar, showed them clips of the Palestine conflict and gave them magazines on related topics.Later, Ameen and Baig founded the Azamgarh/Sanjarpur modules of IM that carried out multiple blasts across the country. On Nov 23, 2007, the outfit planted IEDs on court premises in Varanasi, Faizabad and Lucknow. It sent an email to news channels five minutes prior to the blasts to claim responsibility — the first time IM owned up to a terror attack.Baig, like the Nov 10 bomber, Umar Un Nabi — a doctor who, too, was associated with Al-Falah — wanted to carry out blasts on a massive scale. ""Ab pattern change karna hoga,"" read a message on Akhtar, aka Hadi's mobile phone, which was retrieved by the special cell of Delhi Police.The sender was Baig, who wanted to engineer a 26/11-type attack or at least reach its scale in terms of casualties and destruction. Years later, Umar actually changed the pattern, carrying out the first suicide car bombing in the capital, which killed 15 people.Shortly after the Batla House encounter in Jamia Nagar in 2008 in which Ameen and another terrorist was killed, Baig fled the country and went to Pakistan.He and a few others like Dr Shehnawaj and Shafi Armar flirted with what was called Islamic State in Khorasan Province (ISKP) before forming Ansar-ud Tawhid, another outfit. Pakistan's ISI continues to be their primary recruiter.","Mirza Shadab Baig, an engineering graduate, moved into a dingy room in southeast Delhi's Zakir Nagar in 2005.

BHOPAL: A Class 11 student died by suicide in Rewa after allegedly facing sustained harassment from a schoolteacher, according to a handwritten note recovered from her room. Police on Thursday seized the girl’s mobile phone and the suicide note, which contains detailed accusations describing the teacher’s alleged conduct in the classroom.In the note, the girl wrote that the teacher would grab her hand under the guise of punishing her, clench his fist and challenge her to open it, or press a pen between her fingers with force. “Whenever the teacher beat me… he would grab my hand. He would hold my hand over the bench and say, ‘Look how cold my hand is.’ What is all this?” she wrote.The girl’s grandfather and father told police that she had no issues at home. They alleged that the pressure and humiliation she faced at school pushed her toward the extreme step.During questioning, the girl’s elder sister named a minor boy from her class with whom the deceased used to speak. However, police said preliminary probe shows no evidence linking the boy to the suicide, calling their interactions “normal friendship.”","A Class 11 student died by suicide in Rewa after allegedly facing sustained harassment from a schoolteacher.

"Jaipur school suicide: Student sought teacher's help 5 times in last 45 minutes, faced aggressive response, says CBSE report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/jaipur-school-suicide-student-sought-teachers-help-5-times-in-last-45-minutes-faced-aggressive-response-says-cbse-report/articleshow/125498920.cms,"(With agency inputs)

JAIPUR: A Class 4 student at a Jaipur school, who died by suicide weeks ago, had reportedly faced bullying in her classroom for over 18 months, including verbal abuse from classmates, while the school failed to maintain a safe and healthy environment, according to a CBSE enquiry report.Following the findings, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) issued a show-cause notice to Neerja Modi School in Jaipur. The notice comes after a CBSE-formed enquiry panel investigated the tragic death of the 9-year-old girl, who reportedly jumped off the school building earlier this month.ACP Mansarover Aditya Kakade said that an investigation in the case is underway. ""The case is being investigated. No arrest has been made so far,"" he said.The enquiry committee highlighted multiple lapses by the school, noting the persistent bullying the girl endured. It stated that her parents had initially reported the issue to teachers in July 2024. The panel further observed that the class teacher failed to respond to the child’s distress, despite the girl approaching the teacher five times in the last 45 minutes of her life.""As per the statements of the parents given to the committee, it is clear that the school did not take any preventive and proactive action on the repeated complaints of bullying and teasing by the classmates. The class teacher and the school management were very well aware of the harassment and the trauma being faced by the deceased child,"" the board noted in the show-cause.The board further said that the conversation and communications made by the parents to the class teacher and the school management went unheard, and accused the school of not taking any action or having any compliance and provisions for a grievance redressal mechanism in such circumstances.Citing the enquiry committee report, the board said, ""... it seems something unusual happened in class and she is looking extremely disturbed. A few hot discussions among students are also observed, and it may be related to the use of bad words and some derogatory comments, as per parents' observation and video footage"".The class teacher, in her written statement, admitted that the deceased student informed her about her classmate using ""bad words"" for her, but the other student denied the allegations. However, other children had complained to the teacher earlier about the constant usage of ""bad words"" in the classroom between students, the show-cause read.The board also noted that the school's committee and policy mechanism were entirely ""non-responsive"".According to the report, the parents of the deceased reported the bullying to the teachers and coordinators more than three times over the 1.5 years, yet the anti-bullying committee never contacted the parents or intervened.In September 2025, the father witnessed a boy bullying the girl during a PTM and complained to the class teacher, who allegedly advised that the child ""should adjust,"" the report says.""The school failed to maintain a healthy atmosphere and lacked specific measures to tackle bullying,"" the report states, adding that these were clear violations of CBSE guidelines, Supreme Court directives and NCPCR safety norms.The Class 4 girl tragically ended her life by jumping from the school’s fourth floor on November 1. Given the gravity of the incident, a two-member CBSE committee visited the school the following day and also met with the girl’s parents.The committee’s findings reveal a troubling pattern of harassment and neglect on that day. The girl arrived at school in a cheerful mood, but after 11 am, she became visibly upset following interactions with classmates involving a digital slate, on which some boys wrote or displayed content that embarrassed and distressed her.CCTV footage reviewed by the committee shows the girl repeatedly asking the boys to stop and erase the content. It also confirms that she approached the class teacher five times in the final 45 minutes of her life, seeking assistance, the report states.The report pulled up the teacher for failing to act on the child's distress, ""even when she approached her five times in the final 45 minutes of her life. The teacher's admitted negligence and reported aggressive response (""shouting"") directly contravenes the requirement for staff to ensure a safe, supportive environment and to act as protective caregivers,"" it said.Beyond the bullying complaints, the committee identified several safety and infrastructure lapses. These include inadequate CCTV monitoring, failure to flag the child's unsupervised movement across multiple floors and the absence of floor attendants at the time of the incident.The stairway from which the child fell had railings described as ""easily scalable and unprotected,"" and the building allegedly had more floors than permissible under school safety guidelines, the report noted.The report also pointed out violations of CBSE regulations, including the mandate to store CCTV footage for 15 days, non-compliance with child protection guidelines, and the school’s failure to offer psychological support despite clear signs of the child’s distress.","The Central Board of Secondary Education issued a show-cause notice to Neerja Modi School in Jaipur.

'Germany Robbed For Kyiv': AfD Leader's 'STOP FUNDS' Ultimatum To Merz After $100,000,000 Scandal

Russia relying on cost-effective agents

Germany ready to fight back





When do we call it a ""war""? How does ""war"" begin? Especially nowadays, in the digital age of cyberattacks?""If a German corvette ship is attacked and sunk by a Russian submarine, you would call that war,"" Sönke Marahrens, a colonel in the German Armed Forces and a military strategist, said at a recent meeting of German security forces. ""But what if metal shavings were thrown into the ship's gears and it is then no longer operational: Is that war?""Marahrens is an expert on hybrid threats. At the autumn conference of the German National Criminal Police Office (BKA), he discussed future challenges with German and international security experts in Wiesbaden.Marahrens' example of sabotage affecting the operational capability of a German warship is a real incident which occurred in January on the corvette Emden, shortly before its delivery to the German navy.Europe is experiencing a steady increase in hybrid attacks. Military personnel, police officers, politicians and scientists have warned that the situation is serious.""We are experiencing cyberattacks, the circumvention of sanctions and arson attacks on a scale we have never seen before,"" said Silke Willems of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, Germany's domestic intelligence agency.Identifying the perpetrators is extremely difficult. For the police and intelligence services, it's often not clear whether they're dealing with a Russian attack, a criminal act or just a case of dilapidated infrastructure breaking down Comparing it to similar incidents usually provides a clearer picture. Russia is deliberately operating in a gray area, investigators say, which complicates the response of the affected countries.According to security authorities, Russia is increasingly relying on cost-effective operations. ""This is now being carried out by so-called 'low-level agents,'"" Holger Münch, head of the National Criminal Police Office, told DW. These individuals, Münch explained, often don't even know who is hiring them, and they are willing to carry out attacks for a relatively small amount of money.The perpetrators are mostly young men who already have a criminal record, many of whom have immigrated to Germany from the former Soviet Union. They are often recruited, for example, via the Russian social media platform Telegram, Münch explained.The Criminal Police Office has significantly expanded its capabilities to combat cyberattacks, according to Münch. Even if the criminals were to rent hundreds or thousands of servers all over the world, the BKA could disable them, he said.Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt has vowed that Germany will intensify its response to the attacks. ""Anyone who attacks us in cyberspace should be aware: We want to and we will defend ourselves in the future! We can also disrupt and destroy,"" Dobrindt said.In the fight against hybrid threats, the German government decided this week that in addition to the Federal Police, the Bundeswehr, the German armed forces, will also be authorized to shoot down drones within Germany. The police, in turn, plan to establish additional drone units to defend against attacks.But it's not just Russian drones, incendiary devices and disinformation that are worrying politicians and security experts: More and more people in Germany are becoming increasingly distrustful of state institutions, a huge challenge.Fake news and lies about democratic institutions and elected officials — all fueled by complex, large-scale Russian disinformation campaigns — aim to destabilize Germany and other democratic countries through hybrid warfare, according to Germany's security authorities.To ensure Germany remains resilient against these attacks, military strategist and Colonel Sönke Marahrens said hybrid warfare must be accepted as a challenge for society as a whole.But it's not just Russian drones, incendiary devices and disinformation that are worrying politicians and security experts: More and more people in Germany are becoming increasingly distrustful of state institutions, a huge challenge.Fake news and lies about democratic institutions and elected officials — all fueled by complex, large-scale Russian disinformation campaigns — aim to destabilize Germany and other democratic countries through hybrid warfare, according to Germany's security authorities.To ensure Germany remains resilient against these attacks, military strategist and Colonel Sönke Marahrens said hybrid warfare must be accepted as a challenge for society as a whole.","Europe is experiencing a steady increase in hybrid attacks.

TikTok Star Megan Farina, Who Mocked Charlie Kirk’s Death ‘Doxxed by MAGA,’ Now Fleeing Home

Megan Farina faces new backlash as users compare her Charlie Kirk video and her Trump criticism





TikToker Megan Farina is getting a new wave of anger online. This started again after she posted a new video where she yelled at Donald Trump and his supporters. Months ago, Megan Farina went viral when she danced and smiled after Charlie Kirk was killed. Many people were shocked by that video. Now, when she is attacking Trump for calling a woman “Piggy” and for his strong Truth Social posts about six Democratic Congress members, people online are calling her “a hypocrite.”The fight grew when conservative creator Collin Rugg shared her new clip on X. Many users wrote that she cannot celebrate someone’s death and then get upset over Trump’s words. They said she is now angry at name-calling but was fine joking about a man’s death. This has made her the center of online debate again, mostly among Trump supporters and MAGA users.Megan Farina first went viral in September after she made a TikTok where she danced and joked after Charlie Kirk was shot and killed. That video brought heavy hate toward her and even toward her boyfriend, whose business got hit with bad online reviews.In her new video, Megan Farina says she is tired of MAGA users calling her evil, ugly, and a bad person. She says she is “done” with the comments and does not want any more abuse in her TikTok section.She also talks about Trump’s “Piggy” remark. Trump had called a Bloomberg reporter “Piggy,” and Megan Farina asked how people can still support him after that.She also reacted to Trump’s Truth Social posts where he said a video by six Democratic members of Congress was “seditious behavior” and wrote that it was “punishable by death.”Online, many people pointed out that Megan Farina herself celebrated someone’s death but is now upset about Donald Trump’s words. Users on X posted things like, “You don’t celebrate a death one day and cry about a name the next.” Others said she can dislike Trump, but celebrating a killing is still wrong.The White House later said Trump does not want those Congress members to be executed. The press secretary said the video may break laws but did not mean Donald Trump was calling for hangings.

Candace Owens questions the timeline involving Charlie Kirk and Tyler Robinson





Candace Owens opened her November 21 podcast by talking about the story of Charlie Kirk’s death. She told her viewers that the story people believe right now is, in her words, the “real conspiracy theory. ” She said the whole thing sounds like “totally crazy stuff” and warned her audience not to fall for it.Charlie Kirk was shot on September 10, 2025, while speaking at Utah Valley University in Orem. A single bullet hit him while he was onstage. Police later said the shot came from a roof near the quad. Two days later, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson was turned in by his father and became the main suspect. Officials said his clothes matched the same look seen in CCTV video taken after the attack. Candace Owens said many parts of this accepted timeline do not feel right to her, and she told viewers she wanted to break down the story.Candace Owens said the first strange detail is that Tyler Robinson “did not attend UVU” and had “never been on UVU campus.” She asked how someone who had never been there suddenly climbed onto a roof, moved around the roof like “Spider-Man,” and knew exactly where Charlie Kirk would be standing.She also questioned how he took one perfect shot with a 30-06 rifle.Candace Owens then spoke about Robinson’s alleged partner, Lance Twiggs, who she said was a transgender individual and Robinson’s “lover.” She returned to a CCTV picture she had talked about before. It showed Robinson walking into a Dairy Queen right after the shot.She said it looked like he ran inside to hide and then texted Twiggs “every minute” about what he had done. Owens said the official story also claims Robinson kept texting Twiggs even when he went home later.She said these texts sound too neat and too perfect. She asked why a person would text all night instead of speaking face-to-face. Candace Owens also asked why someone called a “boy genius” with a 4.3 GPA would write down every moment of a crime in messages. She said this part alone “is the conspiracy theory.”Candace Owens also wondered why there is almost no public record of Robinson. She said he only appears online, does not show his face in court, and once said he might even be “just an AI app.” She said she is tired of people calling her work a conspiracy and believes the accepted story has more holes than answers.Also Read: Candace Owens raises heat while claiming Erika Kirk is on autopilot and holds no verifiable lies after Charlie Kirk was killed","Candace Owens calls the Charlie Kirk story crazy and questions the role of Tyler Robinson and his lover Lance Twiggs.

Ben Bader found unresponsive after workout, says Jupiter Police Department spokesperson Shawn Reed





Ben Bader, a 25-year-old TikTok star known for his simple lifestyle tips and money advice, died from complications of cardiovascular disease, according to the Palm Beach County Medical Examiner, as reported by TMZ. Ben Bader passed away on October 23 after a gym session at a private club in Jupiter, Florida.Police said he was found on the floor by another person at the gym and was not breathing. First responders tried to save him, but he was later pronounced dead at the hospital. His death was ruled natural, and the medical examiner shared that genetic factors likely played a part. Police told the Daily Mail that an “active investigation” is still going on, and they have not ruled out foul play.The medical examiner's report said Ben had hardening and narrowing of the arteries, a serious heart problem he did not know about. He was believed to be healthy and only had some back and shoulder pain, which he was treating with physical therapy. The report also said codeine was found in his urine but not in his blood, and it did not play a role in his death.Ben Bader was working out at his community gym when he got off the treadmill.About eight minutes later, another gym member found him on the floor. Shawn Reed, spokesperson for the Jupiter Police Department, said Ben was found “unresponsive” at Admiral’s Cove, a private members' club. Reed said Ben was not breathing when people found him, and lifesaving steps were done right away.Ben Bader was taken to a hospital, but doctors could not save him. His girlfriend, Reem, said on TikTok that he passed “extremely suddenly.” She said she had talked to him on FaceTime just hours earlier and he looked happy and normal. The two were supposed to go on a dinner date that same night, and Reem said there were “no signs” that anything was wrong.Reem shared a long, emotional message, calling Ben the “kindest” and “most caring” person she had ever met. She said he was loved by everyone and always stayed positive. She told her followers to hold their loved ones close because “life is unforgiving sometimes.”Ben Bader had celebrated his 25th birthday only a month earlier on September 22.

Trump ‘Takes U-Turn’ After Zohran Mamdani ‘Openly Dares’ US President Inside Oval Office | Watch

Months of hostility during the NYC race

Insults set aside in a moment of political pragmatism

Commitment to cooperation going forward





In one of the most dramatic political reversals of the year, President Donald Trump struck an unexpectedly warm tone toward New York mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani during a meeting at the White House — just weeks after denouncing him as a “communist lunatic” and threatening to cut off federal funding if he won the election. The shift has surprised everyone who had expected a tense encounter, given the bitter exchanges of the campaign. Instead, Trump described Mamdani as a “rational person”, praised his vision for New York and signalled a willingness to work closely with him on affordability and public safety — a remarkable U-turn from the hostility he projected throughout the mayoral race.The highly anticipated meeting delivered none of the fireworks that had been predicted. Instead, Trump appeared eager to reassure the mayor-elect, repeatedly emphasising areas of agreement and mutual concern. He congratulated Mamdani on his election victory and told reporters:“I expect to be helping him, not hurting him.”The president even said he would feel “comfortable” living under a Mamdani administration — a statement that raised eyebrows considering his earlier threats to punish New York financially. Mamdani, who had previously branded Trump a “fascist” and a “despot”, focused instead on shared priorities and avoided engaging in past grievances.The scenes in the Oval Office marked a stark contrast to the ferocious tone of the New York mayoral campaign.During the race, Trump repeatedly attacked Mamdani, calling him a “communist lunatic” and warning that federal funding to the city would be withdrawn if he became mayor. Right-wing commentators amplified the criticism, painting Mamdani — a self-described democratic socialist — as a dangerous ideologue.Mamdani retaliated forcefully, accusing Trump of promoting a “fascist agenda” and using the presidency to intimidate New York voters. He argued that Trump’s rhetoric was an attempt to shift attention from the affordability crisis gripping the city.Mamdani later admitted that a sizeable number of Trump voters had approached him with concerns about costs, housing and public transit — issues that shaped the core of his platform.Trump, too, acknowledged these overlapping voter anxieties during the meeting. He said the pair found “unexpected alignment” on key subjects including cost of living, crime and economic pressure on working families. He even suggested Mamdani might “surprise some conservative people”, signalling a softer, more pragmatic view of the mayor-elect.Reporters did not shy away from raising past hostilities. When Mamdani was asked whether he stood by calling Trump a “fascist”, the president intervened, lightly tapping him on the arm and quipping: “You can just say yes — it’s easier.” Mamdani obliged with a brief “OK, yes,” prompting Trump to add:“I’ve been called much worse than a despot.”Trump softened his own prior remarks as well, insisting that Mamdani’s views were only “a little out there” and saying both men had changed in their approach. The exchange underscored both leaders’ desire to avoid reviving past disputes in front of cameras.Both Trump and Mamdani ultimately stressed their intention to work together on shared priorities. They highlighted affordability, housing, food costs, public safety and immigration enforcement as key areas for collaboration. Although ideological differences remain, the pair emphasised their mutual commitment to serving New Yorkers.Trump ended the meeting by expressing confidence in Mamdani’s leadership:“If he could be a spectacular success, I’d be very happy. I’ll be cheering for him.”","President Donald Trump struck an unexpectedly warm tone toward New York mayor- elect Zohran Mamdani during a meeting at the White House. The shift has surprised everyone who had expected a tense encounter, given the bitter exchanges of the campaign. Instead, Trump appeared eager to reassure theMayor- elect, repeatedly emphasising areas of agreement and mutual concern.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125497175,imgsize-101910,width-400,resizemode-4/from-communist-lunatic-to-rational-person39-donald-trump-takes-a-u-turn-on-zohran-mamdani.jpg"

‘THIS IS VIOLENCE’: Global Backlash As Brazil Opens Amazon To Oil Drilling On COP30 Eve





A fire broke out at the COP30 climate summit in Belem, Brazil, on Thursday, forcing thousands of delegates to evacuate and halting negotiations at a critical moment in the two-week conference.Ironically, the blaze appears to have been caused by electrical equipment, likely a microwave — showing that even a summit dedicated to climate action doesn’t always follow its own rules.The blaze began around 2.00 pm (1700 GMT) in an exhibition pavilion. Security footage later showed flames racing up an internal fabric shell lining the walls and ceiling, burning a hole through the roof as smoke filled the corridors and people ran for the exits shouting “fire!”Firefighters said the incident was brought under control within six minutes. Nineteen people were treated for smoke inhalation and two for anxiety, according to the Brazilian presidency of the event.Firefighters and ambulances arrived with sirens blaring as smoke rose from the tents and permanent buildings hosting diplomats, journalists, and activists. The affected area was sealed off with a large sheet, and delegates were escorted in one by one to retrieve belongings, including passports needed for evening flights.Plenary sessions will not resume until Friday.It was the third major incident since the summit began last week, following peaceful demonstrations by Indigenous protesters who first stormed the venue and later blockaded the entrance. COP30 hosts Brazil and United Nations Climate Change said in a joint statement that security responded “swiftly” and the blaze was controlled quickly.After a fire department inspection, Brazil declared the site reopened at 8.40 pm.The disruption hit at a delicate stage in the negotiations, with ministers struggling to break a deadlock over fossil fuels, climate finance, and trade measures. Delegates remain divided over Brazil’s proposed “roadmap” to transition away from fossil fuels, as well as concerns about weak emissions-reduction plans and funding for developing nations.Earlier in the day, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned negotiators that “the world is watching” and urged them to reach an “ambitious compromise.” He also welcomed calls for clarity on the disputed issue of weaning the world off fossil fuels.With less than 24 hours before the summit’s scheduled end, nearly 200 countries are still working to reach consensus. Brazil has described securing a final deal as vital to accelerating global climate action and turning years of promises into meaningful progress.","A fire broke out at the COP30 climate summit in Belem, Brazil, on Thursday, forcing thousands of delegates to evacuate.

NEW DELHI: A 5.5-magnitude earthquake struck central Bangladesh on Friday, killing at least six people and injuring several, AP reported citing officials. The quake, which shook buildings in Dhaka and sent residents fleeing outdoors, was felt across several parts of the country and in neighbouring regions of India including Kolkata.Also read: West Bengal: Strong tremors jolt Kolkata; no damage reported yet The US Geological Survey said the earthquake occurred at 10:38 am, with the epicentre located in the Ghorashal area of Narsingdi district, about 25 kilometres from Dhaka, at a depth of 10 kilometres. Dhaka-based DBC Television reported that six people died in the capital, including three who were killed when a roof and a wall collapsed, and three pedestrians who were struck by falling building railings.Authorities said the tremors caused significant panic in Dhaka, one of the world’s most densely populated cities with more than 30,000 people per square kilometre. Bangladesh’s central region is typically less seismically active than the north and southeast, where interactions between the India and Eurasia plates make earthquakes more common.A separate update from ANI said a 5.5-magnitude quake near Narsingdi was felt widely across Dhaka around 10:40 am and also in parts of India including West Bengal and areas of the northeast.The USGS recorded the event at 10:08 am IST. As per the ANI report, “There have been no reports of casualties or damage so far,” though later official updates confirmed fatalities in the capital.Last month, Bangladesh recorded a magnitude 3.4 earthquake, according to the National Centre for Seismology. Experts note that shallow earthquakes can produce stronger surface shaking because seismic waves travel a shorter distance.Citing USGS figures, The Daily Star reported that a magnitude 4.0 earthquake releases energy equivalent to about 6 tons of TNT, while a magnitude 5.0 quake corresponds to around 200 tons. The energy rises steeply with each magnitude, with a 7.0 quake equalling nearly 199,000 tons of TNT and a 9.0 quake releasing about 99 million tons, comparable to roughly 25,000 nuclear bombs.Bangladesh sits at the junction of the Indian, Eurasian and Burma plates, which move several centimetres each year. The country is intersected by major faults including the Bogura, Tripura, Shillong Plateau, Dauki and Assam faults, placing it within 13 recognised earthquake-prone zones. Regions such as Chattogram, the Chattogram Hill Tracts and Jaintiapur in Sylhet fall within the highest-risk category.Visuals from Dhaka on Friday showed emergency teams assessing damage as authorities monitored aftershocks and structural impacts across the capital.(With inputs from AP and ANI)","A 5.5-magnitude earthquake struck central Bangladesh on Friday, killing at least six people.

'Boycott politics never work': South Africa President reacts to Trump's no-show at G20; US fires sharp response,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/boycott-politics-never-work-south-africa-president-reacts-to-trumps-no-show-at-g20-us-fires-sharp-response/articleshow/125476117.cms,"‘WATCH YOUR TONE!’: Leavitt FUMES After Ramaphosa 'Laughs' At Trump’s Last-minute G20 ‘Scramble’





South African President Cyril Ramaphosa on Friday said the United States had shown signs of reconsidering its G20 boycott, calling it a “positive sign” and insisting that “boycott politics never work,” even as the White House dismissed his claim as “fake news” and accused him of “running his mouth. ”“In a way, we see this as a positive sign because, as I’ve often said, boycott politics never work. It’s always best to be inside the tent than being outside of the tent,” the President added.Ramaphosa said Pretoria had received a last-minute communication suggesting Washington might participate “in one shape or form or other” at the Johannesburg summit. “We have received notice from the United States, a notice which we are still in discussions with them over, about a change of mind, about participating in one shape or form or other in the summit,” he said. “This comes at the late hour before the summit begins. And so therefore, we do need to engage in those types of discussions to see how practical it is and what it finally really means.”The White House rejected any suggestion of a reversal. A senior official said only the acting ambassador, Marc D Dillard, would attend the ceremonial handover of the G20 presidency. “This is fake news. The chargé d'affaires in Pretoria will attend the handover ceremony as a formality, but the United States is not joining G20 discussions,” the official said.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reinforced Washington’s position. “The United States is not participating in official talks at the G20 in South Africa,” she said. She added: “I saw the South African president running his mouth a little bit against the United States and the president of the United States earlier today, and that language is not appreciated by the president or his team.” She noted that Dillard would only “receive that send off at the end of the event” and would not “participate in official talks. ”Ramaphosa reiterated that the United States “needs to be here,” saying: “The United States, being the biggest economy in the world, needs to be here. So it's pleasing to hear that there is a change of approach.”The US boycott follows allegations from Washington that South Africa discriminates against white people and Trump’s claims of violence against white Afrikaner farmers, assertions widely rejected in South Africa. Pretoria said Washington also pressured it not to issue a joint G20 declaration, arguing consensus would be impossible without the United States.Ramaphosa pushed back. “We will have a declaration. The talks are going extremely well. I’m confident we are moving towards a declaration, and they are now just dotting the i’s and crossing the t’s,” he said. “We will not be bullied. We will not agree to be bullied.”The US embassy had separately informed Pretoria that South Africa’s G20 agenda “run counter to the US policy views and we cannot support consensus on any documents negotiated under your presidency.”The summit, the first hosted by an African nation, focuses on debt relief for low-income countries, a just energy transition and securing critical minerals. While leaders including Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin and Javier Milei skipped the event, they sent delegations.Political tensions between the two countries have intensified during Trump’s second term, with high US tariffs on South African goods, Pretoria’s ambassador being expelled and Washington also boycotting the COP30 climate talks in Brazil.Despite the diplomatic friction, US business interests in South Africa remain strong, with more than 600 American companies operating in the country. “The US Chamber of Commerce will use our B20 leadership to foster international collaboration,” chamber head Suzanne Clark said.G20 ambassador Xolisa Mabhongo summed up the stand-off, saying: “The only country that is not in the room is the United States and, of course, it is their choice not to be in the room.”","South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said the United States had shown signs of reconsidering its G20 boycott.

Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene — once one of Donald Trump ’s most loyal and outspoken allies — is stepping down from Congress, bringing an abrupt end to a turbulent political partnership that has collapsed in public view.On Friday evening (US local time), she announced she will leave office on 5 January 2026, citing deep frustration with Republican leadership and the direction of Washington. Her decision comes days after a public clash with Trump over her support for releasing the Epstein files.In a four-page statement, the Georgia Republican said the legislative branch has been “sidelined” and accused her party’s leaders of refusing to move forward on conservative priorities such as border security and “America First” policies.“No matter which way the political pendulum swings, Republican or Democrat, nothing ever gets better for the common American man or woman,” Greene said. She added that when people understand that “the Political Industrial Complex of both parties is ripping this country apart” and that leaders like her cannot stop “Washington’s machine,” they will realise “they, common Americans, The People, possess the real power over Washington,” and she said she would stand with them “to rebuild it.""I look forward to a new path ahead,"" Greene added.As she prepares to leave the House of Representatives, US media reports, as cited by BBC, suggest she may pursue state office — either the Georgia governorship or a Senate seat.Last week, Greene said she had been contacted by private security firms “with warnings for my safety” after Trump withdrew his support for her. In a post on X, she said “a hot bed of threats against me are being fueled and egged on by the most powerful man in the world,” calling him “the man I supported and helped get elected.”Their relationship soured after she joined a small group of Republicans supporting the release of all government-held files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Trump was initially against the legislation but reversed his position when it became clear Greene and other Republicans would join Democrats to pass it.In recent months, she has criticised Trump and Republican leaders on several issues, saying they were not doing enough to lower costs for voters and questioning whether Trump was still putting “America First” due to his focus on foreign policy. She also faulted him for refusing to release the Epstein documents, noting that the president “could have ordered their release at any time.”Trump responded in multiple posts calling Greene a “traitor” and “wacky” and vowing to support a challenger for her seat. The measure requiring the Justice Department to release the Epstein files passed Congress on Tuesday, and Trump signed it into law on Wednesday.",Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene announced she will leave office on 5 January 2026.

US president Trump met New York City's mayor-elect, Zohran Mamdani at the Oval Office on Friday, and the mood was far warmer than anyone expected. They both spoke about shared goals for New York City instead of their usual fights.During the press interaction, a reporter asked Mamdani if he still believed Trump was a fascist. Mamdani had barely started to reply, "" I've spoken about"", when Trump cut in, lightly patted his arm and said, “That’s okay. You can just say yes. It’s easier than explaining. I don’t mind.”Another reporter pressed Trump on Republican leader Elise Stefanik’s claim that Mamdani was a “jihadist.” Trump immediately shut it down. “No, I don’t,” he said when asked if he thought he was standing next to one. “I met with a man who is a very rational person.”Trump had previously called Mamdani a “100% Communist lunatic” and a “nut job.” Mamdani had framed himself as “Donald Trump’s worst nightmare.” But on Friday, both avoided personal blows and focused on affordability in New York, housing, groceries, and rising utility costs- issues that shaped both their campaigns.Trump brushed aside old clashes, including Mamdani’s criticism of deportation raids. He joked he had been called “much worse than a despot.” He also stepped in to defend Mamdani when reporters questioned why he flew to Washington instead of taking transportation that used less fossil fuels, saying, “I’ll stick up for you.”Mamdani said he had requested the meeting to discuss making New York more affordable. Trump admitted he had earlier warned he might pull federal funds if they did not “get along,” but said he no longer expected that to happen.Mamdani’s incoming chief of staff later told NY1 the two leaders still disagreed on many things but found common ground on safety and reducing crime.Trump had played a major role in the mayoral race. He endorsed Andrew Cuomo, questioned Mamdani’s citizenship and even suggested he could have him arrested if he refused to work with immigration agents. Mamdani, born in Uganda and now a naturalised American citizen, defeated Cuomo by arguing he would “stand up to Donald Trump.”","US president Trump met New York City's mayor-elect, Zohran Mamdani at the Oval Office on Friday.

Why the meeting matters for New York City

National and symbolic significance





The meeting between New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and US President Donald Trump has drawn national attention because of the sharp ideological division between them and their long history of public hostility. Trump has previously called Mamdani a “communist lunatic” and threatened to withhold federal funding from New York if he won. Now, in their first face-to-face meeting, both leaders are signalling a willingness to talk, marking a pivotal moment of potential cooperation despite deep political antagonism.Mamdani, a democratic socialist, campaigned on policies focused on affordability and expanded public services, while Trump promotes a conservative national agenda that prioritises stricter immigration enforcement, reduced federal spending and business-focused growth. During the election, Trump supported Mamdani’s opponent and publicly criticised Mamdani’s proposals. Their upcoming meeting marks a change in tone after a period marked by sharp political exchanges from both sides.Despite their ideological gulf, Mamdani enters the meeting with a clearly practical agenda focusing on New York’s affordability crisis, housing and transit funding, public safety and federal support for social programmes.His willingness to engage with Trump reflects the realities of governance, where city and federal interests often intersect. At the same time, Trump has the opportunity to address voter concerns about the cost of living and safety, which could influence federal-city relations moving forward.For Mamdani, the meeting raises his national profile and signals that he is prepared to engage across political divides. For Trump, sitting down with a political rival who has criticised him publicly shows a strategic effort to address urban issues and broaden his reach. Together, this encounter illustrates that even strong political opponents may still engage on shared challenges in a deeply divided political climate.",The meeting between New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and US President Donald Trump has drawn national attention because of the sharp ideological division between them.

US President Donald Trump on Friday said he expects a “civil” and “fine” meeting with New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, despite their sharp political differences and earlier clashes on the campaign trail.Speaking on the Brian Kilmeade show on Fox News Radio, Trump said he gives Mamdani credit for running a “good race” and believes they share at least one goal. “Look, we’re looking for the same thing. We want to make New York strong,” Trump said. “And you know, there’s such a different philosophy. But I’ll let you know. I’ll let you know over the next year.”Mamdani is a democratic socialist who arrived in Washington for the Oval Office meeting. Trump said the encounter should be “quite civil”, adding, “You’ll find out.”The president was also asked about Mamdani’s election-night remark in which the 34-year-old said, “Turn the volume up,” while speaking to Trump through cameras. Trump said he found the line unclear. “He has to be careful when he says that to me,” Trump said. “I said, ‘What does that mean? Turn the volume up. Does that mean? Let’s go at it?’ I don’t think so.He was very nice in calling.”Trump noted the meeting is set for 3 pm and said he plans to allow reporters in. “I would think so. He’s a politician, so I don’t think he has a problem. The one thing I notice about politicians is the answer is always, ‘Yes’ – other than with Biden,” he said.Before the election, Trump repeatedly attacked Mamdani as a “communist” and warned he could withhold federal funds if he won. The POTUS even endorsed Mamdani's rival Andrew Cuomo in the NYC race saying he would rather have a ""bad Democrat"" than a ""communist"" in the city.","US President Donald Trump said he expects a 'civil' meeting with New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, despite their sharp political differences and earlier clashes on the campaign trail.

While Summers' spokesperson maintained that the trip occurred before Epstein's first arrest, revelations of additional flights on Epstein's plane and correspondence with the notorious pedophile have sparked a fierce backlash.





Ex-Harvard president Larry Summers is under fire after newly reported flight records revealed he and his wife travelled to Jeffrey Epstein’s private Caribbean island during their 2005 honeymoon, accompanied by the pedophile's right-hand woman, Ghislaine Maxwell.Summers is already in trouble due to his links to the convicted sex offender.Summers and his wife, Elisa F. New, flew from Massachusetts to Epstein’s island, Little Saint James, on December 21 2005, according to the Harvard Crimson. They travelled on Epstein’s jet, often referred to as the “Lolita Express” in media reports about his alleged trafficking network.A spokesperson for Summers confirmed the visit, telling the Harvard Crimson, “Mr. Summers and Ms. New spent their honeymoon in St. John and Jamaica in December 2005, which was long before Mr. Epstein was arrested for the first time. As part of that trip, they made a brief visit of less than a day to Mr. Epstein’s island.”The records also show that Summers took Epstein’s plane on three other occasions, with several trips occurring while he was serving as Harvard’s president between 2001 and 2006. Their December visit came only months after Palm Beach police had begun investigating Epstein for the rape of a 14-year-old girl.Summers also served as Treasury Secretary under President Bill Clinton. He resigned from the board of OpenAI on Wednesday as pressure mounted over his ties to Epstein. Within hours, he went on leave from both his teaching duties and his role as head of the Mossavar-Rahmani Center at Harvard Kennedy School.The row was further intensified when the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee released more than 20,000 pages of documents from Epstein’s estate. The material includes thousands of emails exchanged between Summers and Epstein from 2013 to 2019, with some messages discussing a woman Summers was interested in. The correspondence continued until the day before Epstein’s 2019 arrest.Epstein died in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial. His death was officially ruled a suicide, but conspiracy theorists and some political commentators have long claimed he was killed to prevent him from revealing information about powerful figures such as Trump and Musk. Maxwell was later convicted on sex-trafficking charges and is currently serving a 20-year sentence in a low-security prison.","Larry Summers and his wife, Elisa F.

Donald Trump’s worst nightmare









In a political moment few expected, two men who have spent the past year trading jabs from opposite ends of the ideological spectrum are about to sit across from each other for the first time. After months of insults, warnings and public sparring, President Donald Trump and New York City’s new mayor elect Zohran Mamdani will finally meet at the White House.Mamdani, a democratic socialist, shares little political ground with the Republican president, but he described the meeting as “an opportunity to make the case for New Yorkers,” saying he intends to raise issues of economic security and public safety. “I'll be ready for whatever happens,” Mamdani told CBS.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday, “President Trump is willing to meet with anyone and talk to anyone and to try to do what's right on behalf of the American people.”Mamdani used similar phrasing, noting that his team initiated the meeting “because I will work with anyone to make life more affordable for the more than 8.5 million people who call this city home.”Still, their public remarks about one another have often been far sharper. Let us look at some of the very public jabs the two have thrown at each other.In his victory speech after winning the New York City mayoral race, Zohran Mamdani explicitly taunted President Trump. Addressing Trump by name, Mamdani told supporters, “Donald Trump… I have four words for you: turn the volume up!”. He followed with a defiant warning: “To get to any of us you will have to go through all of us.” He followed with a defiant warning: “To get to any of us you will have to go through all of us.”Donald Trump has increasingly leaned into branding Zohran Mamdani with a label he knows will land loudly. The president has repeatedly referred to Mamdani, who openly identifies as a democratic socialist, as a communist, cycling through variations like “my little communist mayor” and “a communist lunatic.” In June, he amplified the rhetoric further, posting: ""Zohran Mamdani, a 100% Communist Lunatic, has just won the Dem Primary, and is on his way to becoming Mayor. We've had Radical Lefties before, but this is getting a little ridiculous.""Mamdani, meanwhile, has directed his own criticism toward the former administration. After New York Mayor Eric Adams floated the idea of revising school bathroom policies, Mamdani publicly condemned the move and its echoes of federal hostility toward trans students. He tweeted: ""Awful and dangerous to hear the Mayor echo the transphobic bigotry coming from the Trump administration."" He followed with an additional statement: ""It's completely at odds with the values of our city. ""Donald Trump has also pushed speculation about Zohran Mamdani’s legal status — despite the fact that Mamdani is a naturalized US citizen.

Mamdani's Powerful Message To Trump Before White House Sit-Down





New York mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani found himself on the receiving end of yet another attack from right-wing commentator Laura Loomer after he posted a casual selfie from his seat on a plane.The photo was shared on his X accoun which appeared harmless. But Loomer immediately pounced.Replying to him, she wrote: “Why not just take the train? Also, is that First class? Such a man of the people…”The jab played into a recurring line of criticism from MAGA activists who insist that the self-described socialist mayor-elect is a hypocrite for using air travel instead of what they view as more modest, working-class transport. Loomer and others have repeatedly argued that Mamdani’s policies, including free public buses, taxing the rich, and rent freezes — are out of touch with “real Americans,” and have warned that New York City is “doomed” under his leadership.Last week, Loomer wrote online that Mamdani should be “denaturalized,” adding: “Only in America can an Islamic immigrant from Africa openly support terrorism, maintain their citizenship and become Mayor of America’s most iconic city.” She even claimed people were taking Polymarket bets on “whether or not Zohran Mamdani will be deported.”In May, she went further, posting: “Get ready for another 9/11,” while calling him a “pro-HAMAS Muslim socialist.”Despite her history of cotroversey, Loomer was recently credentialed to cover the US Department of Defence — a move that was not welcomed by many journalists and watchdogs who see it as part of a broader effort to reshape press access under the GOP administration.Mamdani’s campaign is mostly centred on housing affordability, public transport access, taxing the rich and working-class issues.

Row erupts over Nikki Haley's son saying naturalised citizens should not hold office in US: 'Even our white nationalists are brown',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/row-erupts-over-nikki-haleys-son-saying-naturalised-citizens-should-not-hold-office-in-us-even-our-white-nationalists-are-brown/articleshow/125488582.cms,"'No Talent In U.S.': Trump BURNS MAGA Base For India Reset? What It Means For Indian Workers

Social media response:

America’s such a diverse and multicultural place that even our white nationalists are brown.

Even the racism has been outsourced to Indians.

The irony is wild, a name rooted in Sanskrit(Lotus)and a life rooted in classic American birthright rules. Nikki Haley parents weren’t even U.S. citizens when she was born, yet here we are getting lectures about who’s ‘American enough.’

Another nepo baby with nothing to offer except more ignorant rhetoric of ridiculousness. These politicians did not hug their children enough.

Someone should tell Nikki's son that many of the Founding Fathers were naturalized citizens.

Immature, naive and xenophobic. Good job Nikki!

He doesn’t realize the white supremicists are never going to accept him, does he?





Indian-origin Nikki Haley ’s son, Nalin Haley, stirred a row after suggesting that naturalised citizens should not be allowed to hold public office in the United States. His comments were made during a discussion about immigration and national identity with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson. Both Democrats and the MAGA base were torn on this remark as it undermines a lot of values that are laid out by the current modern Republican party.The debate began when the 24-year-old claimed that only those born in the United States should be eligible to run for public office, saying the country “needs leaders who were raised in the culture from birth.” Supporters argued that he was expressing a patriotic position, but critics countered that his view was unconstitutional and deeply out of step with the nation’s long history of welcoming immigrants into its political and civic life. Nalin also criticised the idea of dual citizenship, calling it “stupid” and arguing that a person is either American or not.Nikki Haley is herself the daughter of Indian immigrants and has not publicly endorsed or rejected her son’s remarks. Meanwhile, last week Nalin called for a ban on all H-1B visas, saying that immigrants are coming in and stealing jobs and opportunities from his friends in the States.The youngster’s remarks come at a time when H-1B visas remain a sensitive issue. Earlier this month, Donald Trump softened his stance on the programme, saying the US is in dire need of foreign skilled workers and lacks sufficient domestic talent. The shift sparked a wave of backlash from his once-loyal MAGA supporters, who now accuse Trump of betraying the “America First” agenda.","Indian-origin Nikki Haley ’s son, Nalin Haley, stirred a row after suggesting that naturalised citizens should not be allowed to hold public office in the United States.

People stand in huge lines to get stuffed into narrow seats with no leg room. The bathrooms are insanely tiny. Disembarking the plane is chaos. The food is barely food. But sure, the problem is wearing comfortable clothing and not dressing up





People are crammed into tiny seats, paying extra for basic comforts, and dealing with constant delays.. but the real crisis is sweatpants? Maybe fix the system before policing outfits

Maybe stop treating passengers like cattle and their mood might improve. And hey, you want me to dress up, buy the clothes, clean up the planes, give us more room. Your travel fantasy died in the '70s. Cry harder.

Why would I want to dress up when I have to take off my belt and shoes and jacket and have my body fondled to get through security at 6 am?

You shouldn't wear your pajamas. But the airlines went from caring about people's comfort and space to packing people in like sardines and trying to maximize profit by lower their standards.





US transportation secretary Sean Duffy drew flak after suggesting that air travel would improve if passengers simply “smartened up” and dressed better.Speaking on Fox Business, Duffy promoted a new campaign urging travellers to “bring civility back” to airports. He said passengers should “be nice, say please, say thank you,” and even suggested a return to the days when people “didn’t wear pajamas to the airport. "" He urged people to ""dress up a little bit.”Some viewers agreed with the general call for politeness, but critics called the comments tone-deaf. They argued that cramped cabins, weather issues, constant delays and rising ticket prices—not passengers’ outfits—are what make flying miserable. Others said it was hypocritical for a Trump Cabinet member to lecture the public on civility while the president routinely uses hostile language online on his Tirth Social account.Duffy said his message was simply meant to encourage patience during the busy holiday travel season, but passengers weren’t buying it. Users on X quickly piled on, trolling, memeing and mocking the transportation secretary for blaming travellers instead of fixing the real problems.","US Secretary of State Sean Duffy said air travel would improve if passengers simply “smartened up” and dressed better.

Why this meeting matters





New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani is set to meet President Donald Trump at the White House on Friday — an unexpected moment for two figures who have spent months taking jibes at each other. Mamdani’s team requested the meeting, and Trump agreed, saying he was willing to “work something out. ”The meeting is expected to be more than a polite handshake. Both sides see it as a chance to push their priorities on issues that will shape New York’s next four years. But it also comes with political baggage: Trump backed Mamdani’s rival Andrew Cuomo before the mayoral election, saying he would rather have a “bad Democrat” than a “communist” running the city.One of Mamdani’s top goals is to confront the cost-of-living crisis that many New Yorkers say has become unbearable. NYC is the wealthiest city in all of USA and housing costs, food prices, childcare and basic services are very expensive in general and Mamdani campaigned on the promise of making the city livable again. He has said repeatedly that the White House must work with the city, not against it, if affordability is to improve.“I will work with anyone to make life more affordable for the more than 8.5 million people who call this city home,” he said ahead of the meeting.At the same time, he warned he would not hesitate to call out federal policies he believes harm New Yorkers: “If an agenda hurts New Yorkers, I will be the first to say so.”Despite their ideological clash, Mamdani knows Trump controls major federal resources. The mayor-elect is expected to push for continued or increased support in areas such as housing assistance, transit funding, and social safety programmes. His platform includes bold proposals like a rent freeze, expanded social services and public grocery stores — ideas that would rely heavily on federal cooperation.This creates an unusual dynamic: Mamdani is appealing to a president who has previously threatened to withhold funds from New York and has criticised soicalist and progressive leaders. That tension raises the stakes for both men, not just in the usual left-versus-right sense but also in the up-versus-down fight over power and leverage.Public safety is expected to feature prominently in the discussion. For the Indian-origin Mamdani, safety is tied to the broader social fabric — investment in mental health care, reforming crisis response systems, and making policing more transparent and community-driven. Trump’s approach has focused more on enforcement and stricter penalties, so the two may clash but could also find areas of mutual interest, such as federal support for mental health programmes or anti-gun trafficking initiatives.Immigration will be another flashpoint. Mamdani has always been critical of POTUS's border policies and enforcement methods but says he will defend the rights of immigrant New Yorkers while still engaging in dialogue. He has tried to frame the meeting as an opportunity to advocate rather than simply confront.Mamdani is may be entering the White House with a built-in disadvantage. Trump holds major leverage through control of federal funds and national platforms. He has previously taken aim at Mamdani personally, calling him a “communist” and suggesting the city would face consequences under his leadership. That history could influence how direct Mamdani chooses to be.Still, the meeting gives Mamdani a rare national spotlight. It presents a chance to demonstrate he can challenge Trump without shutting down cooperation entirely. His progressive base back at home expects him to stand firm, which means he must balance principle with pragmatism.For Mamdani, the meeting is about proving he can govern beyond ideology and fight for struggling New Yorkers. For Trump, it signals he is willing to sit down with a fierce critic while still keeping his leverage. The conservative MAGA audience — including figures like Laura Loomer, Ted Cruz, Eric Trump and Tucker Carlson — has consistently attacked Mamdani before and after his win in New York, which makes this a closely watched meeting for the conservative base as well.On the Democratic side, Mamdani has positioned himself as a potential bridge between different factions of the party — from the hard-left activists to the more traditional liberal Democrats. Senior figures such as Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are also closely watching his rise, seeing him as a possible middle catalyst who can speak to both poles of the Democratic coalition.","New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani is set to meet President Donald Trump at the White House on Friday.

Explained: Why Donald Trump called Democrats’ video to troops 'seditious behaviour punishable by death',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/explained-why-donald-trump-called-democrats-video-to-troops-seditious-behaviour-punishable-by-death/articleshow/125487341.cms,"What triggered the clash

Why the reaction is so intense

Why this matters

What the Democratic video actually said

What happens next

The larger picture





American politics has seen angry words, wild speeches and theatrical showdowns, but a sitting president accusing lawmakers of behaviour “punishable by death” has jolted Washington in a way few statements do. A video released by six Democratic lawmakers urging US service members to reject unlawful orders has triggered President Donald Trump’s most explosive and punitive response since taking office.Six Democratic lawmakers with military or intelligence backgrounds released a video reminding troops that they are legally allowed to disobey illegal or unconstitutional commands. Senator Mark Kelly, a former Navy captain and astronaut, says the law is clear that service members can refuse unlawful orders. The group argues that threats to the Constitution can come from inside the country and that the oath of service requires loyalty to the Constitution above everything else.The messaging was blunt, direct and framed as a constitutional safeguard.President Trump reacted with fury. He called the lawmakers “traitors”, described the video as “seditious behaviour at the highest level” and repeatedly suggested that such offences are “punishable by death”.He demanded their arrest, said an “example must be set” and amplified posts calling for the lawmakers to be hanged.For Trump and his allies, the video was interpreted as an attempt to undermine civilian control of the military by encouraging troops to question the legitimacy of presidential authority. The White House argued that telling 1.3 million service members to assess the legality of orders amounts to destabilising the chain of command.Republicans in Congress supported this reading, calling the Democrats’ video irresponsible and dangerous. They framed the president’s comments not as calls for execution but as a forceful description of potential legal consequences.Democrats, in turn, accused the president of issuing threats against elected officials. They argued that Trump’s rhetoric could endanger their safety at a moment when political tensions in the US are already high.The United States military operates on strict hierarchy, civilian oversight and legal clarity. Any messaging that appears to challenge that hierarchy draws immediate scrutiny. But any suggestion that a president is invoking death penalties against political opponents raises even more fundamental alarms.The debate is unfolding in a country acutely sensitive to political violence. Recent years have seen attempted assassinations, arson attacks on political leaders’ homes and the killing of lawmakers. Trump himself has survived two assassination attempts. As a result, language about treason, sedition and punishment carries a far sharper edge than normal partisan rhetoric.The lawmakers did not tell troops to defy the president. They told them to refuse unlawful commands if they ever arise. This is rooted in longstanding military law and the principle that soldiers cannot be compelled to carry out illegal orders. The video frames this as a way of protecting the Constitution against internal threats.They emphasised that no amount of intimidation or political pressure will deter them from upholding their constitutional duty. Their tone was resolute, but within legal boundaries.The matter is being reviewed at the federal level. Congressional leaders are coordinating with security agencies to ensure the targeted lawmakers and their families are protected. The White House is trying to steady the political fallout without backing away from the president’s core argument that the Democrats crossed a legal line.It remains extremely unlikely that any sedition charges will arise. The threshold for such a charge is high and the lawmakers’ video falls well within political speech protected by law. But the clash has sharpened questions about how far political rhetoric can go when national security and civilian control of the military are involved.At its core, the confrontation is about two competing ideas of loyalty. The Democratic message appeals to loyalty to the Constitution. The president’s response appeals to loyalty to the chain of command. Both ideas are foundational to American democracy. The clash between them is now playing out in the open.This episode also exposes the fragility of the moment. When routine constitutional reminders provoke talk of treason and death, it signals a political environment primed for escalation. In a country already anxious about violence and extremism, the tone of its leaders is not just rhetoric. It shapes public expectations and determines how combustible the months ahead may become.","Six Democratic lawmakers with military or intelligence backgrounds released a video reminding troops that they are legally allowed to disobey illegal or unconstitutional commands.

At least 15 workers were killed and seven others injured on Friday after a boiler exploded at a glue-making factory in Faisalabad, eastern Pakistan, authorities said. Police reported that the factory manager had been arrested, while the owner fled the scene shortly after the blast.The explosion occurred at the industrial unit in Punjab province, severely damaging the building and triggering a fire that spread panic across the neighbourhood. Local administrator Raja Jahangir said the cause of the blast was being investigated and confirmed that nearby homes had also been affected.Police official Mohammad Aslam said an investigation was underway to determine what led to the boiler failure. Pakistan Punjab chief minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif expressed condolences to the families of the victims and directed officials to provide the best possible medical care to the injured.Industrial accidents remain common in Pakistan, where poor safety standards often contribute to fatal incidents. In 2024, a similar boiler explosion at a Faisalabad textile mill left a dozen workers injured.

A judiciary under reconstruction



Munir’s expanding power base



(With inputs from agencies)





Pakistan’s judiciary is in a moment of crisis as senior judges resign amid a contentious constitutional amendment reshapes the balance of power in favour of the military. Behind the crisis is the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment, a sweeping package pushed through parliament within days. Lawyers, judges and opposition parties argue that it has weakened the courts and elevated the military’s top commander to a position with no modern parallel.Since then, Pakistan’s judiciary has been hit by a series of high-profile resignations. On Saturday, Lahore High Court judge Shams Mehmood Mirza stepped down, and his family said his decision was directly linked to the 27th Amendment. His departure followed those of Supreme Court justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah, who issued sharply worded letters condemning the amendment as a direct attack on judicial independence.The creation of a new Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) lies at the heart of judicial restructuring. The FCC now holds exclusive jurisdiction over constitutional matters, stripping the Supreme Court of its original powers. Pending petitions have already been shifted to the new court. President Zardari swore in Justice Aminuddin Khan as its first chief justice; six other judges were appointed, including serving Supreme Court and high court judges, though one judge reportedly refused to join.The FCC’s establishment has sparked intense concern. Critics say the president’s new power to transfer judges risks becoming a tool to sideline dissenting voices. Opposition groups argue this will fundamentally weaken judicial independence and concentrate constitutional authority in the executive and military leadership.Government ministers, however, hailed the package as “historic” and a step toward greater efficiency and national unity. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the amendment proved that “solidarity” prevailed during a time of national strain.With judges resigning, courts being reconfigured, and the military gaining unprecedented constitutional control, Pakistan faces a moment of reckoning.The amendment passed with overwhelming numbers in both houses has dramatically restructured Pakistan’s defence architecture, elevating army chief Asim Munir to Chief of Defence Forces with command over all three military branches. His five-year tenure now resets from the date of notification, enabling him to remain in office until 2030.The Senate has since rushed through four related bills, including amendments to the Army, Air Force and Navy Acts, along with changes to Supreme Court practice rules. These laws remove the earlier equality among service chiefs and replace references to the Joint Chiefs of Staff system with a new “National Strategic Command”, further centralising military authority under Munir.Dawn reported that appointments, extensions, and tenures under these reforms “shall not be called into question before any court on any ground whatsoever”.Experts quoted in multiple reports warn that the shift risks internal military tensions and further erodes civilian oversight. Lawyer Osama Malik described the reforms as something “usually granted in absolute monarchies”, arguing they grant lifetime protections not only to Munir but also to President Zardari.Opposition lawmakers responded with uproar, shredding copies of the bill and walking out. PTI leaders labelled the move “deeply undemocratic” and “the final nail in the coffin of an independent judiciary”. Critics say these changes could reshape the political landscape, particularly for nearly 200 cases involving former prime minister Imran Khan.","Pakistan's judiciary is in a moment of crisis as senior judges resign amid a contentious constitutional amendment.
