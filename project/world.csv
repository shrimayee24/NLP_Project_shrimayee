Desperate to escape, some attendees broke through barricades, and children suffered minor injuries in the chaos.Ambulances were trapped in the crowd for over 30 minutes, delaying the transport of the affected people to Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH) and Omandurar Government Hospital. Although around 50 ambulances were deployed, with 20 stationed along the beach road, navigating through the dense crowd proved challenging.Among the deceased was D John, 56, from Korukkupet, who attended the event with his wife, Elisamma, and brother-in-law, Shamkumar.

Cops arrested Mostakin Sardar, 19, of the village, on charges of murdering the Class 4 student. The girl had been missing since Friday when she left home for tuition.Justice Ghosh questioned the police's contention that it could not add sections of Pocso Act before postmortem report was ready, saying inquest findings were enough for it.He directed the cops to add Pocso sections and produce the accused before a Pocso court, not regular courts. The cops had moved HC for an urgent hearing to remove legal roadblocks to the postmortem.Acceding to demands of the victim's kin, police had moved a lower court, seeking presence of a magistrate during postmortem, but the plea was turned down. The parents also wanted the postmortem in a central facility. The state told the HC that it had no problem.He then ordered the postmortem at AIIMS Kalyani and asked police to hand over the body by 11.45am Monday.The judge said if AIIMS had the infrastructure, it could conduct the postmortem within its premises; otherwise, it could do so at the nearby state-run JNM Hospital Kalyani. If the procedure is carried out at the latter hospital, only AIIMs doctors would perform it, the judge directed.

Complaints against Velingkar continued to be filed at police stations in Goa.Protesters demanded Velingkar be externed from Goa until after the decennial exposition of St Francis Xavier, which will be held from Nov to Jan next year.

NEW DELHI: Protesting junior doctors in Kolkata began fast unto death on Saturday as they said that their demands were not fulfilled by the Mamata Bengree-led West Bengal government .The doctors had called off their ""total cease work"" on Friday with a 24-hour ultimatum to the state government to fulfill their demands.""Like we said yesterday, we have called off our 'total cease work' (at state-run medical colleges and hospitals), but we are launching a hunger strike from today (as West Bengal government has failed to fulfill our demands),"" an agitating junior doctor told news agency PTI at a press conference in Kolkata.""The state government has failed the deadline and hence we are starting the fast unto death till our demands are fulfilled. To maintain transparency, we have installed CCTV cameras at the dais where our colleagues will be holding the fast,"" another junior doctor said.""We will join duty as promised but will not eat anything,"" he told PTI.The doctors' protest was triggered by the rape and murder of a trainee woman doctor at Kolkata's RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on August 9.The doctors had reverted to total cease-work on October 1, citing an attack on their colleagues at the College of Medicine and Sagore Dutta Medical College but withdrew it on Friday after a 24-hour ultimatum to the Mamata government.The junior doctors have set a 10-point charter of demands revolving around the security at hospitals, threat culture and patient care services. They have also demanded the removal of the health secretary, an investigation into corruption in West Bengal Medical Council and West Bengal Health Recruitment Board, as well as student council elections in all medical colleges.The Bengal Junior Doctors' Front has raised several demands, including the installation of CCTV cameras on hospital premises, round-the-clock security for healthcare workers, and stricter protocols to prevent incidents of violence against medical professionals.The doctors have also highlighted the culture of fear and intimidation within state-run hospitals, alleging that the administration has not provided a safe working environment.Later, they said unless they saw demonstrable intent on the part of the government to address these issues with clear action on the ground, they would be compelled to carry on with the protest.","The doctors' protest was triggered by the rape and murder of a trainee woman doctor at Kolkata's RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on August 9.

Meghan's 'vanished' ring worries Prince William back home: 'It has set off alarm bells',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/meghans-vanished-ring-worries-prince-william-back-home-it-has-set-off-alarm-bells-diana-legacy-prince-harry/articleshow/113931159.cms,"Prince William is reportedly concerned about the whereabouts of valuable pieces from his late mother Princess Diana ’s jewelry collection, that were once in Meghan Markle ’s possession, The Mirror reported.Among these jewels is Meghan’s engagement ring , a piece steeped in personal history and sentiment, which appears to have ""vanished"" in recent months.In 2017, Prince Harry proposed to Meghan Markle with a custom-made engagement ring that held deep symbolic meaning.The ring featured two diamonds from Princess Diana's personal collection, carefully set next to a larger stone sourced from Botswana, a country significant to the couple’s relationship. The ring was seen as a tribute to his late mother and a way of keeping her legacy close to him and Meghan.However, less than two years after the engagement, the ring underwent a subtle but notable transformation. It was reportedly updated with a slimmer band, a modification that Meghan, 42, first showcased in 2019 during the Trooping the Colour event. The revamped engagement ring was displayed alongside a new ring, and together they became iconic symbols of the Duchess of Sussex .But this year, Meghan has been seen without her engagement ring at multiple public events. In May, she attended a gala without the sentimental piece on her finger, which sparked questions and rumors. Initially, it was reported that the ring was simply ""being fixed,"" yet as time has passed, its absence has only deepened the mystery.A source close to the royal family said that Meghan’s missing ring has raised eyebrows, particularly back in the UK, where Prince William, is known to be deeply protective of his mother’s legacy. The insider expressed confusion over why Meghan would not be “proudly” wearing the ring at significant public events. The source hinted that this development might have caused concern for William, as it touches on the sensitive subject of preserving Princess Diana’s memory. “It's safe to say it has set off alarm bells at the Palace,” a source told The MirrorAccording to Sky news, Diana’s personal jewelry collection which is estimated to be worth around $20 million comprises heirlooms passed down through generations, as well as pieces gifted by foreign royals, her former husband Prince Charles, and her last boyfriend, Dodi Fayed. After Diana’s tragic death in 1997, the collection was split between her two sons, William and Harry, who have since shared parts of it with their wives.","Prince William is reportedly concerned about the whereabouts of valuable pieces from his late mother Princess Diana's jewelry collection.

Like Epstein list, a list of names, all celebrities, with links to P Diddy and his Freak off sessions, are doing the rounds on social media. The alleged list contains names of Leonardo Dicaprio , Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Ashton Kutcher, Paris Hilton, Howard Stern, Russell Brand, Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez, Russell Simmons, Usher, Meghan Fox. The list goes viral as Usher, Pink deleted their X posts and theories that Justin Bieber might have been a victim of Diddy float around.Nobody has been implicated in the Sean Combs case so far.P Diddy is facing serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering where he forced women to have sex with male prostitutes that continued for days as the entire action was caught on camera. Huge stocks of baby oil, drugs were found at Diddy's sex den while Diddy did not plead guilty to the charges.Usher who once stayed with Diddy said his X account got hacked and that's why all his past posts disappeared. This happened as his old statement in which said he witnessed wild things when he stayed with Diddy resurfaced.Apart from Usher and Pink, Megan Fox deleted all her posts on Instagram and X triggering speculations over how she was linked to Diddy.An old snipped of Khloe Kardashian claiming that she attended one of Diddy's naked parties emerged.

The officer claimed there were 15 years of wild parties, suggesting that while not everyone who attended was complicit in trafficking, they witnessed inappropriate behavior. He emphasized that many people knew what went on, especially as things became more explicit late at night.Also read on the Diddy case:","No Hollywood A-lister has been implicated in the Sean Diddy trafficking case but several 'Diddy lists' are viral.

The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) organised an exhibition displaying items seized from the group on the first anniversary of the October 7 attacks by Hamas. The exhibit featured vehicles and equipment used by the thousands of Hamas-led militants who invaded southern Israel, according to an IDF statement.The display includes pickup trucks, motorcycles, tractors, uniforms, and intelligence materials seized during the operation.According to the IDF, approximately 70,000 pieces of enemy equipment have been confiscated since the start of the war, including around 1,250 anti-tank missiles, RPGs, and 4,500 explosive devices.In a post shared on X, the IDF commemorated the somber milestone, saying, “Marking one year since the deadly October 7 Massacre, the IDF has established an exhibition displaying the items seized from Hamas terrorists who invaded Israel on October 7, as well as during the combat in Gaza, to showcase them to the world.”The attacks on October 7, 2023, saw hundreds of Hamas militants infiltrate Israeli borders, resulting in over 1,200 deaths and more than 250 hostages taken.As of now, approximately 100 hostages remain in captivity. In response, Israel launched a major counteroffensive in Gaza, aiming to dismantle Hamas' military infrastructure.However, the rising civilian death toll in Gaza, especially among women and children, has sparked global humanitarian concerns about the conflict’s escalation.The Gaza health ministry reports that more than 35,000 Palestinians have been killed since the war began. The conflict has also expanded regionally, with Yemen’s Houthi rebels targeting Israel and other nations in the Red Sea, while Israel continues strikes against Hezbollah in Lebanon to counter further threats.As violence escalates, calls for a ceasefire and a hostages deal have intensified, with international leaders urging for a two-state solution as a path to lasting peace in the region.","The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) organised an exhibition displaying items seized from the group on the first anniversary of the October 7 attacks by Hamas.

Anniversary of the deadly Hamas

The October 7, 2023, deadly Hamas -led attack which prompted Israel’s devastating counteroffensive in the Gaza Strip, has intensified over the past year, spreading to new fronts. It has resulted in the displacement of 2.3 million Gazans, according to Gaza’s health ministry.According to Reuters, among the displaced is Rana Salah, a Gazan mother who cradles her one-month-old daughter Milana in a sweltering tent at a camp in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza.She expresses the deep guilt she feels for bringing her child into a world ravaged by war and suffering.""If it were up to me, I wouldn't have gotten pregnant or given birth during the war because life is completely different; we've never lived this life before,"" she told Reuters.Reflecting on her past experiences, Rana recalls, ""I gave birth twice before, and life was better and easier for me and the child. Now, I feel like I've wronged both myself and the child because we deserve to live better than this.""Milana was born via a cesarean section in a hospital tent, as complications arose during Salah's pregnancy. The ongoing conflict has prevented the family from returning to their home, forcing them to relocate from one tent to another.According to Unicef data, Milana is among the approximately 20,000 infants born in Gaza over the past year. ""Instead of returning to our house, we keep moving from one tent to another... where diseases are widespread and the water is contaminated,"" Rana said.The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported a significant decrease in postnatal services in Gaza, limiting access to necessary care for women who have complications and have less access to the care they need, as do their babies.According to Rick Brennan, the WHO's Eastern Mediterranean Regional emergency director, newborns face the threat of malnutrition, especially if their mothers are unable to breastfeed due to the lack of access to breast milk substitutes.He mentioned that constant movement and displacement can be highly disruptive for a newborn, increasing their risk of infection.Manar Abu Jarad, who is currently staying in a school shelter run by the UN Palestinian refugee agency ( UNRWA ), gave birth to her youngest daughter Sahar on September 4th via cesarean section, her husband was killed in the war.Upon learning that she would require a cesarean for the birth, Abu Jarad was concerned about how she would manage to care for her other children while recovering from the surgery. ""I already have three girls. I started shouting... How can I carry (water) buckets? How can I bathe my daughters? How can I help them and my husband is not with me, he was martyred,"" Abu told Reuters.""I've reached the point where I cannot carry the responsibility for this girl ... Thank God I found some help here,"" she said. She has borrowed what she could from family and is forced to use just one diaper a day for the baby, adding that, ""I don't have the money to provide diapers or milk for her.""Abu yearns for the war to end and hopes to return home, even if it means living in a tent beside what was once her house. ""The important thing is to go home. Enough of all the exhaustion we are experiencing here, enough carrying buckets, enough of the dirt in the bathrooms. It's really, really hard and really tiring for us. Diseases are everywhere,"" she added.As the anniversary of the deadly Hamas-led assault on southern Israel approaches, the nation braces for a tense week marked by both mourning and continued fighting.With the security situation unstable, shifting restrictions on public gatherings in Israel have cast uncertainty over memorials planned for the victims of the assault, deepening the anguish as the region remains in turmoil.The current war, a particularly deadly episode in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict , was triggered on October 7, 2023, when Hamas militants attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.In response, Israeli air and artillery strikes have reduced much of the Palestinian enclave to rubble, and the Gaza health ministry reports that more than 41,500 Palestinians have lost their lives in the Israeli assault.","The October 7, 2023, deadly Hamas -led attack which prompted Israel’s devastating counteroffensive in the Gaza Strip, has intensified over the past year.

Kamala Harris Kicks off media blitz with ‘Call Her Daddy’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-harris-kicks-off-media-blitz-with-call-her-daddy/articleshow/113998128.cms,"Harris said the US won’t stop pressure on Israel and “Arab leaders” for a ceasefire deal.

Vice President Kamala Harris is making a push to reach key voters ahead of the November 5 election with a media blitz of television and podcast appearances, including on Call Her Daddy and The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.Plans include a visit to New York on Tuesday for appearances on ABC’s The View, The Howard Stern Show and Colbert’s show on CBS, a senior campaign official said.On the Call Her Daddy episode, released Sunday, Harris underscored her support for abortion rights and pledged to “continue to fight for student debt relief.” Her appearance on the podcast reflects the importance of connecting with younger audiences who will be key to the election outcome, according to her campaign.Call Her Daddy and The View have large female audiences, a voter bloc that favors Harris over former President Donald Trump in polls ahead of the presidential election.Harris was viewed very or somewhat favorably by 51% of female likely voters in the latest Bloomberg/Morning Consult swing-state poll, while 44% held those views about Trump.Harris’s media campaign follows needling by Republicans, including presidential nominee Trump and running mate JD Vance, that the vice president has shied away from interviews.In a preview from an interview with CBS’s 60 Minutes airing Monday, Harris said the US won’t stop pressure on Israel and “Arab leaders” for a cease-fire deal that also frees hostages taken by Hamas in the group’s October 7, 2023, attack on Israel.CBS has said that Trump’s campaign backed out of a 60 Minutes sitdown after both candidates initially agreed to interviews with the network.Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz kicked off a media push on Sunday with a Fox News interview that included questions about his history of misspeaking and flubbed statements on the campaign trail that Republicans have capitalized on.Walz redirected criticism about his comments backing access to in vitro fertilization — his wife said she received intrauterine insemination, not IVF — to Trump.“I don’t think people care whether I used IUI or IVF when we talk about this,” Walz said on Fox News Sunday. “What they understand is Donald Trump would resist those things.”During last week’s vice presidential debate with Vance, Walz said he “misspoke” when saying he was in Hong Kong during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in Beijing — and added he’s “a knucklehead at times.”“I will own up when I misspeak,” Walz, who’s in his second term as governor of Minnesota, said Sunday. “I will own up when I make a mistake.”On Monday, Walz is scheduled to appear on ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel Live. A senior campaign official said he’ll also appear on a major US podcast, but didn’t specify which.Harris and Walz will visit critical Sun Belt states later in the week. Harris is participating in a Univision town hall on October 10 in Nevada, an attempt to court the Latino voting bloc that the campaign has struggled to grasp as firmly as previous Democratic candidates.Both will visit swing state Arizona, where early voting begins October 9.","Vice President Kamala Harris is making a push to reach key voters ahead of the November 5 election with a media blitz of television and podcast appearances.

faces false claims of fund misappropriation

Weather control conspiracy: Targeting republicans?

Dam and body disposal hoaxes spread fear

Efforts to debunk the misinformation

Political misinformation clouding recovery efforts

(With inputs from agencies)

As Florida braces for the arrival of Hurricane Milton , the aftermath of Hurricane Helene is being further complicated by a torrent of conspiracy theories and misinformation . These baseless claims have worsened the challenges for recovery teams trying to provide aid to devastated communities, making an already dire situation even more complex.Hurricane Helene, which struck on September 26, left over 225 people dead across multiple states, from Florida to North Carolina.Yet, as federal and local relief efforts ramp up, misinformation has emerged online, further muddying the recovery process. Among the most persistent conspiracy theories is a claim that FEMA misappropriated disaster relief funds to support undocumented immigrants.This claim, pushed most prominently by former President Donald Trump , has been widely debunked. Trump has asserted, without evidence, that ""Biden and Harris had used federal emergency funds on people that should not be in our country."" Deanne Criswell, head of FEMA, firmly denied this, saying, ""This kind of rhetoric is not helpful to people."" Independent fact-checkers and FEMA officials explained that disaster recovery funds are separate from programs aimed at aiding migrants.Another troubling theory making waves suggests that the US government can control the weather, and that Hurricane Helene was deliberately steered toward Republican-voting areas to influence the upcoming presidential election. This baseless idea, amplified by far-right figures like Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene, has gained traction on social media platforms, particularly on X (formerly Twitter).“Yes, they can control the weather,” Greene posted, further fueling the false narrative. The claim, which echoes similar theories from past natural disasters, suggests that Democrats, led by President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, used Helene as a political weapon to harm Republican voters.Other conspiracy theories have spread panic in the hardest-hit areas. In North Carolina, one false claim suggested a dam was about to burst, leading to unnecessary evacuations. Another rumor, widely circulated online, alleged that FEMA was planning to bulldoze bodies under the rubble in some towns. These stories, despite being false, have added to the chaos and distrust in the recovery process.Criswell warned that such baseless claims create fear and prevent residents from seeking much-needed aid. ""It has a tremendous impact on the comfort level of our own employees to be able to go out there,"" she said, noting that the disinformation has even led to threats against FEMA workers.Authorities have taken steps to debunk the most dangerous falsehoods. FEMA has launched a rumor control page to counteract the conspiracy theories and provide accurate information to the public. Local leaders from both parties have also stepped in to calm tensions. Glenn Jacobs, Republican mayor of Knox County, Tennessee, urged citizens to ""put aside the hate for a bit and pitch in to help.""Yet, despite efforts to curb the spread of misinformation, conspiracy theories continue to flourish, especially on platforms like X, which has become a hub for right-wing disinformation since being acquired by Elon Musk. Some of the most viral posts, including those claiming federal authorities are withholding aid from Republican areas, have garnered millions of views.As federal and state officials work tirelessly to restore devastated communities, the political atmosphere surrounding Hurricane Helene continues to escalate. President Biden has emphasized that his administration ""will continue working hand-in-hand with local and state leaders – regardless of political party."" However, the spread of false information has led to a growing distrust in government efforts, particularly in Republican-leaning areas.With Hurricane Milton now expected to make landfall later this week, officials worry that the disinformation surrounding Helene could further erode trust in disaster relief efforts, making it harder to protect vulnerable communities from future storms.","Hurricane Helene left over 225 people dead across multiple states, from Florida to North Carolina.

'Not 1950s anymore': Kamala Harris responds to 'doesn’t have children keeping her humble' remark,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/not-1950s-anymore-kamala-harris-responds-to-doesnt-have-children-keeping-her-humble-remark/articleshow/113997230.cms,"60

US vice president Kamala Harris has responded to Arkansas governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders ’s recent criticism, which suggested Harris lacks humility because she doesn’t have biological children. Speaking during an appearance on the Call Her Daddy podcast, Harris challenged the outdated notion, celebrating her “modern family” and highlighting the evolving definition of family in today’s society.With her remarks, Harris pushed back against traditional views, reminding listeners that family comes in many forms and that women shouldn’t be defined by whether or not they have children.The controversy began when Sanders, during a town hall moderated for Republican candidate Donald Trump in Michigan, implied that Harris wasn’t grounded because she didn’t have children of her own. ""My kids keep me humble,"" Sanders remarked. ""Harris doesn’t have anything keeping her humble.""Harris, speaking on the popular podcast hosted by Alex Cooper, addressed the “outdated view”. “I don’t think she understands that there are a whole lot of women out here who, one, are not aspiring to be humble,” Harris said. “Two, a whole lot of women out here who have a lot of love in their life, family in their life, and children in their life.”Harris, who is married to Doug Emhoff, shared insights into her own life, highlighting her “modern family” that includes Emhoff’s children from his first marriage, Cole and Ella, whom she affectionately calls her own. “We have our family by blood, and then we have our family by love, and I have both. I consider it a real blessing. Cole and Ella call me ‘Momala.’ We have a very modern family, and I’m also friends with my husband’s ex-wife,” Harris saidHarris’s comments come as part of a broader conversation about family and the changing roles of women. The vice president took the opportunity to underscore that today’s families no longer fit into rigid molds of the past. ""This is not the 1950s anymore. Families come in all kinds of shapes and forms, and they’re family nonetheless,"" she added, drawing a clear line between traditional and contemporary notions of family.Harris also touched upon derogatory remarks made by Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, who had previously expressed disdain for what he called “childless cat ladies” running the country. Harris dismissed these comments as ""mean-spirited"" but took the opportunity to steer the conversation in a positive direction. She emphasized the importance of women uplifting one another, saying, “I think it’s really important for women to lift each other up.”Her appearance on the podcast comes as Harris ramps up media outreach in the final month of her campaign against Donald Trump. The vice president’s campaign has been criticized for limited media appearances, but in the coming days, Harris is set to feature on a variety of high-profile programs, including CBS'Minutes, ABC's The View, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, and The Howard Stern Show.While on the Call Her Daddy podcast, Harris and Cooper also delved into topics such as reproductive rights and Harris’s career as a prosecutor focusing on violence against women. Cooper, known for centering conversations around women’s empowerment, noted how crucial it was to discuss issues impacting women directly with the vice president, whose campaign has increasingly focused on reproductive rights and gender equality.","Kamala Harris responded to Sarah Huckabee Sanders' criticism that she lacks humility because she doesn't have children.

Bush and Al Gore—has confidently predicted that Kamala Harris will emerge victorious in 2024.Lichtman holds a Ph.D. from Harvard University, focusing on modern American history and quantitative methods. He is a distinguished professor at the American University in Washington, DC, and has authored 13 books alongside numerous academic articles.Since joining the race in late July, Harris has consistently led national polling averages against former President Donald Trump . Following a highly publicised debate in Pennsylvania on September 10, which attracted over 67 million viewers, Harris’s lead increased from 2.5 percentage points on the day of the debate to 3.3 points a week later. This gain was accompanied by a slight decline in Trump’s polling average, which fell by half a percentage point.While national polls can provide insights into candidate popularity, they may not be definitive indicators of election outcomes due to the US electoral college system. With 538 electoral votes up for grabs—requiring 270 for victory—most states tend to vote predictably along party lines, leaving only a handful of battleground states to ultimately decide the election.","Political analyst Allan Lichtman has asserted that the upcoming polls for the 2024 Presidential election will remain unaffected by the so-called "" October surprise.""Lichtman, who has forecasted the outcomes of nearly every US presidential election over the past fifty years, has confidently predicted that Kamala Harris will emerge victorious in 2024.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113998322,imgsize-58684,width-400,resizemode-4/113998322.jpg"

"Guns, transgender rights on docket for US Supreme Court fall term",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/guns-transgender-rights-on-docket-for-us-supreme-court-fall-term/articleshow/113997111.cms,"US Supreme Court (AP photo)

WASHINTON: The US Supreme Court returns from its summer recess on Monday with regulation of "" ghost guns "" -- firearms made from kits -- and medical care for transgender youth on a docket that risks being gate-crashed in the event of a contested presidential election.David Cole, the legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ), which frequently brings cases before the highest court, said he expects ""a much quieter term than we've had in the last couple of years.""""But you know, that could change if the presidential election is close and disputed,"" Cole added in a reference to potential lawsuits stemming from the November 5 White House contest between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris.In a landmark decision last term in a case filed by Trump, who is charged with conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election, the conservative-dominated court ruled 6-3 that a former president has broad immunity from criminal prosecution.The justices also dismissed a Colorado court ruling that would have barred Trump from the November ballot because of his role in the January 6, 2021 assault on the US Capitol by his supporters.One of the first cases the justices will hear -- on Tuesday -- involves ghost guns: firearms sold online or in stores as ""buy build shoot"" kits that can be easily assembled at home.The court will hear a challenge from gun manufacturersand owners to a rule from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) that requires ghost guns, like other firearms, to have serial numbers and for their purchasers to undergo background checks.According to ATF figures, some 20,000 ghost guns were recovered at crime scenes in the United States in 2021, a tenfold increase from 2016.Another high-profile case, described by Chase Strangio, an ACLU attorney, as one of the ""most significant LGBTQ cases"" to ever reach the Supreme Court, involves the deeply divisive issue of gender-affirming care for transgender youth.The Justice Department is challenging a Tennessee ban on treatments for transgender minors such as puberty blockers or hormone therapy. Tennessee is one of two dozen Republican-led states enforcing such restrictions.In April, the court allowed a similar ban -- in Idaho -- to take effect while legal challenges proceed. Under the Idaho law, medical professionals who provide treatments to minors can face up to 10 years in prison.Ethics, low approval, reformThe Supreme Court will also hear a challenge to a law in Texas that requires pornographic websites to verify the age of visitors in order to limit minors' access to online sexual content.The law mandating the sites to require state-issued identification from users has been challenged by a trade association representing the adult entertainment industry on the grounds it violates the free speech rights guaranteed by the First Amendment to the US Constitution.The Supreme Court has also agreed to decide whether a $10 billion lawsuit filed by Mexico, accusing American gunmakers of fueling drug trafficking and violence, can go ahead.Smith & Wesson and gun distributor Interstate Arms are seeking a dismissal of the Mexican government's suit, which has been winding its way through US courts since 2021.The politically charged rulings, ethics scandals and the decision two years ago striking down the nationwide right to abortion have contributed to near record-low approval ratings for the Supreme Court, particularly among Democrats.Fifty-two percent of the Americans surveyed in a Gallup poll in July said they disapprove of the way the court is handling its job, while 43 percent said they approve. Sixty-six percent of Republicans said they approve, but only 15 percent of Democrats.The Supreme Court adopted an ethics code last year following reports of luxury vacations received by conservative justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito -- both of whom have denied any impropriety -- but it was criticized for lacking an enforcement mechanism.Thomas and Alito also both rebuffed calls to recuse themselves from cases related to the 2020 election -- Thomas because his wife supported Trump's efforts to overturn the results and Alito because flags linked to Trump's false election claims were flown outside his home.Three of the nine justices on the top court -- Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett -- were nominated by Trump, giving conservatives a 6-3 majority on the bench.Democratic President Joe Biden proposed reforms of the nation's highest court in July -- including limiting a justice's current lifetime appointment to an 18-year term -- but there is little to no chance of passage in a deeply divided Congress.","US Supreme Court returns from its summer recess on Monday.

Coming just after the devastating Hurricane Helene , which caused significant damage across the southeastern U.S., Milton is expected to hit the already hard-hit Tampa Bay area. Officials urged residents in vulnerable areas to leave, with over 500,000 people facing mandatory evacuation orders in Pinellas County, which includes St.Petersburg.Milton strengthened from a tropical storm into a Category 1 hurricane on Sunday and is projected to make landfall on Wednesday. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis warned that the storm’s impacts could be even worse than Helene's, particularly due to lingering debris from the earlier hurricane. ""What's going to happen to that debris? It's going to increase the damage dramatically,"" he said. Schools in Pinellas County have been closed through Wednesday, and six hospitals, along with nursing homes, have been evacuated as a precaution.The storm, currently packing winds of 85 mph, is expected to become a Category 3 or 4 hurricane by the time it reaches the coast. Governor DeSantis expanded the state of emergency to 51 counties and urged residents to prepare for power outages and potential food and water shortages. ""You have time to prepare,"" he said, encouraging residents along Florida's west coast to heed evacuation orders.Hurricane Helene, which hit just days before, has already caused widespread destruction, particularly in the northern regions. The death toll from Helene has risen to at least 230 people, making it the deadliest storm to hit the U.S. mainland since Hurricane Katrina. Federal assistance is in place for the ongoing recovery, and President Biden has approved over $137 million in aid. Meanwhile, emergency services continue to work around the clock to clear debris and prepare for Milton's arrival.","Milton strengthened from a tropical storm into a Category 1 hurricane on Sunday and is projected to make landfall on Wednesday.

Republican National Committee co-chair Lara Trump has termed the recent filing of a 165-page brief by federal prosecutors in her father-in-law Donald Trump ’s election fraud case a ""ridiculous ploy,"" suggesting it aims to influence voters just weeks ahead of the election. During an appearance on CNN ’s Talk show 'State of the Union', she expressed concern over the timing of the brief, which seeks to convince US District Judge Tanya Chutkan that Trump's alleged actions following the 2020 election were personal, rather than official, and thus justifiable for indictment, as reported by Newsweek .The brief was partly unsealed on Wednesday, detailing accusations against Trump, who faces four felony counts in connection with efforts to overturn President Joe Biden ’s election victory, culminating in the January 6 , 2021, Capitol riot. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges, asserting that the prosecution is politically motivated.Lara Trump echoed that the former president will ""of course"" accept the election's results ""if he feels that this is a free, fair and transparent election.""One revelation from the filing was a conversation between Trump and an unnamed White House aide during the Capitol riot. The aide informed Trump that then-vice president Mike Pence had to be evacuated due to potential danger, to which Trump reportedly responded, ""So what?"" Lara Trump was questioned by host Dana Bash about this alleged reaction and condemned the overall narrative surrounding January 6 as exaggerated and politically charged.""The January 6 situation has been amplified to a level that I don't think is almost believable to so many people right now,"" she said, adding that the timing of the allegations suggests Democrats lack confidence in vice president Kamala Harris as a candidate.Legal experts have described the evidence presented against Trump as ""pretty damning,"" with additional allegations revealing a Trump campaign staffer allegedly encouraging unrest during the vote count in Detroit. Furthermore, Trump is accused of telling family members aboard Marine One that ""it doesn't matter if you won or lost the election. You still have to fight like hell,"" a statement reportedly overheard by a White House staff member willing to testify.Trump has dismissed the allegations as a ""hit job"" and continued to maintain that the 2020 election was stolen, insisting he would only accept the results of the 2024 election if it is ""free, fair, and transparent.""

Joe Biden: FEMA administrator hits back at Trump’s 'ridiculous' claims on Biden's Hurricane Helene response,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fema-administrator-hits-back-at-trumps-ridiculous-claims-on-bidens-hurricane-helene-response/articleshow/113993436.cms,"<p>Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) administrator Deanne Criswel <span class=""redactor-invisible-space"">(Photo: Reuters) </span><br></p>

As the federal response to Hurricane Helene becomes a focal point in the final stretch of the presidential campaign, US President Joe Biden ’s administration is pushing back against former President Donald Trump ’s unfounded claims about the storm recovery efforts, as per USA Today.Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) administrator Deanne Criswell , appearing on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday, assured that FEMA has all the necessary resources to respond to Helene, which has severely impacted parts of Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and other states.With North Carolina and Georgia being key swing states , the political implications of the recovery efforts have been increased.Criswell dismissed Trump’s claims that disaster relief funds were being redirected to support undocumented immigrants, and that aid was being withheld from Republican regions. She called these accusations as ""frankly ridiculous and just plain false.""“This kind of rhetoric is not helpful to people,” Criswell said. “It’s really a shame that we’re putting politics ahead of helping people.”Trump, who has consistently criticised the response, made a series of remarks during recent public appearances. At a rally in Michigan last week, he claimed, “Kamala spent all her FEMA money, billions of dollars, on housing for illegal immigrants,” alleging that this left FEMA with no resources for storm recovery. Trump went on to say, “They stole the FEMA money, just like they stole it from a bank, so they could give it to their illegal immigrants.”FEMA’s Shelter and Services Programme allocates $650 million for humanitarian support to noncitizens after their detention, but this is separate from disaster relief funding. “No money is being diverted from disaster response needs. None,” clarified a White House statement.Department of Homeland Security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas claimed that FEMA has adequate funds for immediate needs but may struggle if additional storms occur. “We are meeting the immediate needs with the money that we have,” Mayorkas said, adding that further funds would be required for a full recovery.Congress recently approved $20 billion for disaster relief, but Biden has indicated that additional funding will be needed to address future storms.Meanwhile, Trump stepped up his criticism during a rally in Pennsylvania, focusing on the $750 payment FEMA offers to disaster victims to cover essential items. “Remember, $750 to people whose homes have been washed away, and yet we send tens of millions of dollars to foreign countries,” Trump said.The Biden administration defended this initial payment, explaining that it is meant to cover urgent needs like food, water, and medication, with additional assistance potentially available after further assessment.","Hurricane Helene has severely impacted parts of Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and other states.

One of the most notable moments during Donald Trump's return to Butler was an address by Scott Presler , a young man with long hair who may not be widely recognised by mainstream political audiences, but holds significant influence within the MAGA movement , particularly among younger supporters.Presler, known for his pivotal role in registering voters across Pennsylvania and the broader United States, took the stage after being introduced by Lara Trump.His message to voters was energising, as he finally received recognition for his years of hard work in registering Republicans.He emphasised the importance of Pennsylvania, suggesting the state held the power to change the world, and urged residents to check their voter status to ensure they were active voters. Presler reached out to various groups, appealing to union workers by asserting that they wanted their votes to keep jobs in America. He also addressed the Amish community, promising to protect their raw milk, farming, religious freedom, and school choice, as well as ensuring they could afford large families.For hunters, he noted that many were not registered to vote, encouraging them to support the Second Amendment and to register. Presler expressed his deep love for the country and called on Pennsylvanians to use their ballots to support Trump in the upcoming election, reminding them that President Trump had taken a bullet for the nation and now needed their backing.Scott Presler, a conservative activist, gained prominence for his involvement in Republican politics and movements. Born in Florida or Virginia in the late 1980s, he is the son of a U.S. Navy captain and holds a degree in criminal justice from George Mason University.Presler has been involved in conservative politics since around 2015, initially working as a regional field director for the Republican Party of Virginia and supporting Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. He co-founded Gays for Trump and became known for his use of social media to promote Trump and conservative ideas. In 2017, he volunteered with and later worked for the anti-Muslim group ACT for America , organising events such as the controversial March Against Sharia.Presler has been linked to far-right movements, including the Stop the Steal protests, which falsely claimed electoral fraud in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. He participated in demonstrations in Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Washington, D.C., promoting these claims, though he did not enter the Capitol during the January 6th attack. In recent years, Presler has shifted his focus towards voter registration , organising neighbourhood clean-ups and running a nonprofit called Early Vote Action , which seeks to mobilise early Republican voting.Openly gay, Presler has voiced his support for several conservative Republican policies, such as Florida's Don't Say Gay law and stances on gun ownership. He has also been a critic of Islamic extremism, particularly after the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando.","Scott Presler, a conservative activist, gained prominence for his involvement in Republican politics and movements.
