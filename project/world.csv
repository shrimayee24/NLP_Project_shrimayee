Flash floods wreak havoc in Kullu

Rivers swell, roads blocked

NEW DELHI: At least two people have died and around 20 are feared swept away after a series of cloudbursts, flash floods, and heavy rain battered parts of Himachal Pradesh on Wednesday, triggering widespread destruction across Kangra and Kullu districts.Rescue teams recovered two bodies from the Manuni Khad stream in Kangra district, where floodwaters inundated a labour colony near the Indira Priyadarshini Hydroelectric Project site, news agency PTI reported. Officials said 15–20 labourers, who had taken shelter at the site after work was suspended due to rain, are feared missing after a sudden surge in the Khaniyara Manuni Khad swept through their settlement.Teams from the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), local administration, revenue department, and gram panchayats have launched a massive search and rescue operation. Some workers linked to the project have been reported safe.BJP MLA from Dharamshala, Sudhir Sharma, confirmed on social media that about 20 workers were swept away in the Kangra incident. Rescue operations remain ongoing in difficult weather conditions.Meanwhile, cloudbursts in Kullu district caused severe flash floods, washing away homes, a bridge, shops, and parts of roads. Three people went missing in Rehla Bihal while trying to salvage belongings from their homes, officials said.Flash floods were also reported in Manali and Banjar. In Banjar's Hornagad area, a bridge was destroyed and water entered a government school compound, damaging fields and a cowshed.“I urge residents to stay away from rivers and drains. The damage in Sainj, Tirthan, and Gadsa is extensive,” said Banjar MLA Surinder Shauri, adding that the administration had been asked to act swiftly.The Manali-Chandigarh highway was partially eroded near Manali after the swollen Beas River cut into its edge, though traffic continues to move. Videos from affected areas show submerged vehicles and gushing floodwaters causing destruction.The Beas and Sutlej rivers are flowing above normal levels, while roads in Lahaul-Spiti have been blocked due to landslides, debris, and overflowing drains. The route from Kaza to Samdoh remains impassable, local police said.According to the MeT office, Palampur recorded the highest rainfall at 145.5 mm since Tuesday evening.

"In UP village, forgotten Indian roots of Ayatollah Khomeini",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-up-village-forgotten-indian-roots-of-ayatollah-khomeini/articleshow/122010671.cms,"KINTOOR (BARABANKI): In Kintoor, a tranquil village of 13,000 nestled along the Ghaghara, 70 kilometres from Lucknow, only five Shia families remain. Among them, the Kazmis claim a distant kinship with Syed Ahmad Musavi Hindi, grandfather of Ayatollah Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini, the fiery cleric who ignited Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution and became its first Supreme Leader.Born in Kintoor in the early 19th century, Ahmad’s journey from this unassuming village wove a legacy that reshaped West Asia’s history. He left India, escaping colonial rule in 1830, migrating to Najaf, and then finally settling in Khomeyn in 1834. Hence the family name.A portrait of Ruhollah Khomeini still hanging in his drawing room, septuagenarian Syed Nihal Kazmi says, “My great-great-great-grandfather Mufti Mohammad Quli Musavi and Syed Ahmad Musavi were cousins. Ahmad’s story began here in Kintoor, but he became Iran’s forever.” The village, once a vibrant hub of Shia scholarship in the kingdom of Oudh, is concerned with the war in West Asia.BBC journalist and author Baqer Moin, in his book Khomeini: Life of the Ayatollah, writes that Syed Ahmad Musavi Hindi left Kintoor around 1830, drawn to Najaf, Iraq, for pilgrimage. There, he befriended Yusef Khan Kamarchi, a landowner from Farahan, near Khomeyn, Iran.Persuaded by Yusef, Ahmad settled in Iran in 1839, purchasing a sprawling house and garden in Khomeyn that remained in the family for over a century.Ahmad went to become a Twelver Shia cleric. From his third wife, Sakineh Ahmad, who was his friend Yusef’s sister, Ahmad had three daughters and a son, Syed Mostafa, father of Ruhollah Khomeini. Ahmad died in 1869 and was buried in Karbala.The Musavi family’s roots trace back to Nishapur (or Neyshabur), Iran, over 2,500 kilometres from Kintoor. “In the early 18th century (1700), they migrated to India, settling in Kintoor,” Moin notes. The family, Musavi Syeds, claimed descent from the Prophet through his daughter and the seventh Shia Imam, Musa al-Kazim, a lineage rooted in Nishapur.Syed Adil Kazmi, Nihal’s youngest son and an LLB graduate, says, “Our ancestors’ journey from Nishapur to Kintoor, and Ahmad’s return to Iran, tied two worlds together.”Today, Iran’s defiance under Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei echoes Khomeini’s unyielding spirit. “Long before Khamenei or the 1979 revolution led by Khomeini, it was Ahmad, born in our Kintoor, whose choice to settle in Iran changed West Asia’s discourse,” Adil says.From Ahmad’s departure to Khomeini’s revolution, Kintoor’s quiet lanes hold stories of faith, migration, and a family that bridged continents, leaving an indelible mark on history.Kintoor’s legacy also includes Justice Syed Karamat Husain, a Musavi Syed who rose to the position of a judge at the Allahabad high court and founded the Karamat Husain Muslim Girls’ PG College in Lucknow, championing education for women.","The Kazmis claim a distant kinship with Syed Ahmad Musavi Hindi, grandfather of Ayatollah Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini.

210 minutes of arguments & SC's 'conditional' stay that led to it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/210-minutes-of-arguments-scs-conditional-stay-that-led-to-it/articleshow/122081789.cms,"NEW DELHI: Arguments extending over 210 minutes before a Supreme Court vacation bench on June 23, 1975, challenging an 11-day-old verdict of Allahabad HC annulling then PM Indira Gandhi 's election from Rae Bareli, and Justice V R Krishna Iyer's June 24 'conditional stay' to keep her afloat as PM, led to imposition of Emergency on June 25.One of the greatest lawyers of India, Nani Palkhivala, and a team of 10 advocates had appeared for Indira before the high court, which on June 12 found her guilty of corrupt electoral practices, set aside her election, and disqualified her from holding elective office for six years. However, HC stayed operation of the order for 20 days to enable her to appeal in SC.Presenting Indira's appeal before judge Justice Iyer on June 23, Palkhivala was allowed to argue for 90 minutes, the same as Raj Narain's counsel Shanti Bhushan to counter it, and then another 30 minutes to Palkhivala for rejoinder.On June 24, Justice Iyer gave a long interim order and said Indira was entitled to participate in Lok Sabha proceedings as PM, but would not have the right to vote or draw remuneration as an MP till her petition was decided by the apex court. It said her powers as PM would remain unaffected.Much later, Justice Iyer revealed it was Palkhivala's brilliance which persuaded him to grant stay. In Justice Iyer's own words, ""Nani presented the case lucidly and luminously, pressing every point that deserved to be made but not haranguing or cringing...His courtesy to the court was winsome, his diction delectable, his precision perfect.""A day later, at 11pm, Indira went to Rashtrapati Bhavan to inform President Fakruddin Ali Ahmed that her govt had decided to impose a state of internal Emergency at once. After arguing the case, Palkhivala had left for Bombay.After imposition of Emergency, many renowned lawyers requested Palkhivala to withdraw from representing Indira. Palkhivala agreed and rang up TOI to publish a long statement about returning the brief - Indira's case file. Risking the draconian censorship powers vested with the police, TOI agreed to publish a short news item stating Palkhivala had returned the PM's brief.On June 27, 1975, Palkhivala wrote to Indira: ""While I adhere to my views regarding the legal merits of the PM's appeal against HC's judgment on the election petition against her (filed by Raj Narain), the measures taken by the govt this morning are such that, consistent with my lifelong convictions and the values I cherish, I have requested the law minister (H R Gokhale) to convey to the PM my decision to withdraw as counsel from the appeal. Unfortunately, pre-censorship did not permit even this perfectly innocuous statement to be printed.""A year later, Indira's personal envoy Mohd Yunus took a dig at Palkhivala by comparing his action with that of a doctor who abandons a patient and questioned his professional ethics. Palkhivala was not the one to be perturbed by such insinuations.","Nani Palkhivala and a team of 10 advocates had appeared for Indira before the high court.

Pakistan Major who 'nabbed' Abhinandan killed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-major-who-nabbed-abhinandan-killed/articleshow/122081687.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a big setback for the ISI and Pakistan army, a Major rank officer and over a dozen other security personnel were killed in separate ambush attacks by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters in Waziristan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Tuesday. The slain Major, Moiz Abbas, from the 6 CDO battalion (SSG), had claimed he had captured IAF pilot Abhinandan Varthaman in 2019.Abbas was honorarily promoted to the rank of Major for his act. While Pakistan army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir attended his funeral prayers on Wednesday, President Asif Zardari and PM Shehbaz Sharif offered condolences and praised him for fighting against the operatives of ‘Fitna-Al-Khwarij’, a term used by Pakistan for referring to TTP fighters.On Feb 27, 2019, Varthaman, then a Wing Commander, had downed an enemy jet (F-16) during an aerial combat with Pakistan in the aftermath of the Balakot airstrikes a day before. His own jet was subsequently hit, prompting an ejection and landing on enemy soil. He was held captive for three days and released by Pakistan on March 1. He was later conferred with the Vir Chakra, India's thirdhighest war-time gallantry medal, and promoted to the rank of Group Captain.Abbas (37) was an SSG commando from Chakwal. He was seen in an interview to the Pakistani media describing Varthaman’s capture and rescue from angry civilians.Confirming Abbas’s death, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement that Abbas led his troops from the front. “He fought gallantly and paid the ultimate sacrifice along with another brave son of the soil, Lance Naik Jibran Ullah, during the intense fire exchange,” it said. The ISPR also claimed that 11 TTP fighters were killed and called them “India-sponsored terrorists”, their usual ploy to avoid naming Afghanistan or Taliban.Sources said the TTP fighters targeted Pakistan army personnel in two separate ambushes in Kurram and Sararogha in south Waziristan. While eight Pakistani soldiers were killed and 10 injured in Kurram, at least six soldiers were killed in South Waziristan. TTP operatives also destroyed army vehicles and seized weapons before leaving.In a statement issued on its Telegram account, TTP said videos of both attacks would be released soon. ISPR, however, said, “During the operation, our troops effectively engaged the Khwarij location and 11 Indian-sponsored Khwarij were killed and seven got injured by the security forces.”","A Major rank officer and over a dozen other security personnel were killed in separate ambush attacks by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters in Waziristan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

"'Khula' a right, but only courts can issue it: Telangana high court",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/khula-a-right-but-only-courts-can-issue-it-telangana-high-court/articleshow/122081533.cms,"HYDERABAD: In a significant ruling, Telangana high court has clarified that 'khula' - a form of divorce initiated by Muslim women under Islamic law - is a legitimate right, but must be legally processed only through courts, and not by religious bodies. This ensures legal clarity and enforceability of the divorce, the HC said.A division bench comprising justices Moushumi Bhattacharya and B R Madhusudhan Rao on Tuesday upheld a family court's Feb 2024 ruling in a case where a homemaker had obtained 'khula' from her husband, a businessman. The HC ruled that while 'khula' was indeed a recognised form of divorce under Muslim personal law, religious bodies such as a mufti or sharia council could not issue binding divorce certificates. Only courts, or a qazi officially appointed under the law, had the legal power to declare the end of a marriage, it said.The HC ruling comes close on the heels of a Supreme Court judgment in April this year, which reaffirmed that while a Muslim woman had the right to seek 'khula', it was ultimately the courts, specifically family courts, that had the authority to grant or validate the divorce. The apex court also clarified that while a wife could initiate the process of 'khula', the husband could challenge it in court.In the present case, the husband had challenged the 'khulanama' (divorce certificate) obtained by his wife, arguing that it was granted by a religious body, Sada-e-Haq Sharai Council, which he claimed had no legal authority. The family court, however, upheld divorce, noting proper legal procedures had been followed. The husband filed an appeal against the verdict, but the HC dismissed it.","'khula' is a form of divorce initiated by Muslim women under Islamic law.

There should be no place for such double standards.

As he stepped out of his three-room house into the courtyard, he asked his daughter, Savita, a Class IX student, to bring out the cattle for grazing. Moments later, her shrieks sent a chill down his spine.Savita had found a seven-foot-long tiger inside their room - which had only one door - and screamed: ""Baba, baag...

Trump’s Iran gambit: Why Xi Jinping stayed quiet-what it means for Taiwan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-iran-gambit-why-xi-jinping-stayed-quiet-what-it-means-for-taiwan/articleshow/122072709.cms,"AFP photo.

China's STERN Message To Trump As Iran-Israel Ceasefire Ends 12-day War | 'Military Cannot...'

Why it matters

The cautious Chinese response underscores Beijing’s strategic limitations, contradicting Xi’s carefully cultivated narrative that China can counterbalance US power globally.

China has steadily positioned itself as a responsible alternative to US leadership, especially under Trump's turbulent America First policies. But this crisis lays bare the stark gap between China's rhetoric of global responsibility and its actual influence in geopolitical flashpoints.

At stake for Beijing is the credibility of its claims of promoting a multipolar world, raising questions among countries in the Global South and the Middle East about China’s reliability as a genuine global power beyond economic partnerships.

Zoom in

Between the lines

China’s passivity in this crisis aligns with Xi Jinping’s innate caution in foreign policy. Xi’s strategic focus remains primarily domestic-on economic recovery, social stability, and avoiding confrontations that could disrupt the fragile US-China relationship, recently stabilized through trade negotiations.

China’s military presence abroad remains intentionally minimal. Its only overseas military base is a modest naval outpost in Djibouti, positioned alongside other foreign military installations, hardly signaling ambition for aggressive power projection.

As per Vaswani, Jennifer Parker, a defense expert at the ANU National Security College, captured this strategic calculation succinctly: “China’s relationships with other nations are forged out of convenience. Beijing won't intervene significantly unless compelled to protect its own interests.”

Moreover, Xi's caution also reflects deeper strategic thinking among Chinese policymakers who view US involvement in the Middle East as a distraction that ultimately benefits China’s long-term objectives. This aligns with historical Chinese views of the region as a geopolitical quagmire capable of draining America’s strategic resources, potentially hastening the decline of US global hegemony.

William Figueroa, a China-Iran expert at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, bluntly told the washington Post: ""China has little ability to affect the situation directly... it has no ability to militarily influence that conflict.""

What they are saying

Chinese officials sharply criticized Trump’s actions yet stopped short of decisive action or influence:

China’s UN ambassador Fu Cong emphasized, “Iran was hurt but the United States’ credibility was also damaged-both as a country and as a participant in any international negotiations.”

A Global Times editorial condemned the attack, stating that Washington was “adding fuel to the fire of war and pushing the Iran-Israel conflict to a more uncontrollable situation.”

However, Beijing faced skepticism even from Iran-friendly corners. Gedaliah Afterman, a China expert at Israel’s Reichman University, noted that despite close Sino-Iranian ties, “it’s not clear whether or not [China] could convince Iran,” especially given China's lack of meaningful leverage over military affairs or diplomatic outcomes.

For countries in the Global South and the Gulf, China’s championing of a multipolar world may now ring hollow. Governments are looking for reliable crisis partners, not just trade and development. Beijing’s hands-off approach is raising doubts about how much weight it’s really willing to carry. Karishma Vaswani in Bloomberg

The big picture

What’s next

Looking forward, Beijing will likely continue its cautious approach in the Middle East. Its primary focus will remain on protecting economic interests, particularly securing oil supplies and safeguarding trade routes, without provoking further confrontation with the US.

There is a possibility, however, that China might gradually seek to strengthen its diplomatic role in less contentious regional issues-continuing infrastructure investments and quiet diplomacy through the Belt and Road Initiative, rather than direct confrontation or military involvement.

Yet the lingering question remains whether China will ever translate economic clout into genuine geopolitical power or if Beijing will consistently prefer caution, leaving the global stage largely dominated by more assertive powers like the United States.

In this Iran crisis, China’s restrained response revealed more clearly than ever the true extent-and the significant limitations-of its global ambitions.

‘Listen Trump, You Can’t…’: Iran Unleashes Storm Of Defiance, Issues New Dare In Message To US





On June 22, 2025, when US President Donald Trump authorized a series of unprecedented airstrikes against Iranian nuclear sites, it marked America's most significant military escalation in the Middle East since the invasion of Iraq. While international condemnation was swift and predictable from nations like Russia, Turkey, and Pakistan, the most notable voice was the one largely missing from the chorus: China.As per an Opinion by Karishma Vaswani in Bloomberg, Trump’s decision to bomb Iran’s nuclear sites dramatically exposed the boundaries of China’s influence, leaving Beijing relegated to the diplomatic sidelines.Despite robust rhetorical condemnation-branding the strikes as a “serious violation” of international law-Chinese leader Xi Jinping has notably refrained from any meaningful diplomatic or military response. Instead, Trump swiftly transitioned from striking Iranian facilities to mediating a tenuous ceasefire between Israel and Iran, reinforcing Washington’s longstanding dominance in global crises.China, meanwhile, stuck to a cautious script, advocating restraint without putting its geopolitical weight behind concrete diplomatic initiatives.Beijing’s interests in Iran are substantial but complicated, rooted primarily in energy and economic investments.China imports approximately 90% of Iran’s oil exports, accounting for nearly 14% of China's total crude imports. Yet despite such dependency, China's direct investments in Iran have been relatively modest compared to its stakes in Saudi Arabia or the UAE, reflecting cautious Chinese corporations wary of crossing US sanctions.The 25-year, $400 billion strategic partnership agreement inked in 2021 between Beijing and Tehran promised massive infrastructure and energy projects. Yet actual implementation has lagged due to fears of provoking Washington's ire. Bill Figueroa, a China-Iran expert at the University of Groningen, underlines this point clearly: ""Chinese state-owned companies have largely stayed away, mostly out of fear of running afoul of US sanctions. ""Trump’s military strikes have thus sharpened these contradictions. With the US flexing its military might, Beijing's primary response has been passive: evacuating thousands of Chinese citizens from Iran and urging stability to safeguard its oil supplies through the strategically vital Strait of Hormuz.China’s limited influence in the Iran crisis has deeper global implications. Despite diplomatic breakthroughs in the Middle East, such as the Saudi-Iranian normalization deal brokered by Beijing in 2023, China remains fundamentally constrained in leveraging its economic power into geopolitical clout during major crises.Trump’s proactive yet aggressive approach in Iran contrasts sharply with China’s cautious diplomacy, reinforcing global perceptions of US military dominance and diplomatic reach. This diminishes China’s ability to effectively position itself as a credible alternative to US global leadership.Furthermore, Trump’s assertiveness could reshape calculations in Beijing, particularly regarding potential US responses in other hotspots closer to China, such as Taiwan. Gedaliah Afterman noted: “Trump’s willingness to intervene with force in Iran might make Beijing think the US is more likely to respond militarily to a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan.”Conversely, other analysts suggest US military entanglement in the Middle East could reduce strategic pressure on China elsewhere, including on economic fronts. Mohammed Alsudairi, a China-Middle East expert at the Australian National University, said: “US political and strategic bandwidth is limited. The US could be dragged into a quagmire, indirectly benefiting China.”","China’s passivity in this crisis aligns with Xi Jinping's innate caution in foreign policy. Xi's strategic focus remains primarily domestic-on economic recovery, social stability, and avoiding confrontations that could disrupt the fragile US-China relationship.

A Pakistan military officer who had claimed to have captured Indian Air Force pilot Abhinandan Varthaman was killed in a clash with Taliban militants in the Sararogha area of South Waziristan, near the Afghan border.According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Major Syed Moiz Abbas Shah was killed along with Lance Naik Jibran Ullah during an operation against Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters.ISPR added that the Pakistan Army killed 11 TTP militants and wounded seven others in the same operation.Major Moiz’s funeral prayers were held at Chaklala Garrison in Rawalpindi, with Pakistan Army Chief General Asim Munir in attendance.“Major Syed Moiz Abbas fought bravely in the face of resistance and ultimately laid down his life in the line of duty, upholding the highest traditions of bravery, sacrifice, and patriotism,” the ISPR statement quoted Munir as saying.His body was flown to his hometown of Chakwal in Punjab, where he was laid to rest with full military honours.A resurfaced clip of his old interview with Geo TV, now circulating on social media, shows Moiz — then a captain — detailing the events surrounding the capture of Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman.Varthaman had shot down a Pakistani F-16 fighter in February 2019 before his MiG-21 was hit and he was captured. He was held in Pakistan for three days before being released.The TTP, also known as the Pakistan Taliban, was formed in 2007 as an umbrella group of several militant outfits. Its primary aim is to impose a strict interpretation of Islamic law across Pakistan.Believed to have close ties with al-Qaeda, the TTP has been blamed for numerous deadly attacks in Pakistan, including the 2009 assault on army headquarters, attacks on military bases, and the 2008 bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad.Pakistan has described the TTP as “Fitna al-Khawarij,” referencing a historical Islamic sect known for violent rebellion.",Major Syed Moiz Abbas Shah was killed along with Lance Naik Jibran Ullah during an operation against Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters.

BANGKOK: Thailand is further tightening control of cannabis by banning sales of the plant to those without prescriptions.Thailand became the first country in Asia to decriminalise cannabis in 2022, in a move that boosted Thailand's tourism and farming, and spawned thousands of shops. But the country has faced public backlash over allegations that under-regulation has made the drug available to children and caused addiction.Health Minister Somsak Thepsutin signed an order Monday that bans shops from selling cannabis to customers without a prescription. It also seeks to reclassify cannabis buds as a controlled herb.Phanurat Lukboon, secretary general of the office of the Narcotics control board, said on Wednesday that his agency is ready to study and implement the change in regulations.The order will take effect when it is published in the Royal Gazette, although it was unclear when that would happen.The ruling Pheu Thai Party previously promised to criminalise the drug again, but faced strong resistance from its former partner in the coalition government, the Bhumjaithai Party, which supported the decriminalisation.Bhumjaithai quit the coalition last week over a leaked phone call between Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra and former Cambodian leader Hun Sen.Somsak told reporters Tuesday that he would like to relist cannabis as a narcotic in the future. The move came after officials last month revealed that cannabis smuggling cases involving tourists had soared in recent months.Phanurat said that a study done by his agency last year found the number of people addicted to cannabis had spiked significantly after it was decriminalised.Government spokesperson Jirayu Houngsab said in a statement Tuesday that the government ordered the health ministry to tighten control on sales of cannabis because ""many shops opened to sell cannabis both for recreational and medical purposes, allowing easy access for children and general people, which contradicts the government's purpose to crack down on drugs"".A group of cannabis advocates said Wednesday that the change in regulations was politically motivated. The group said they will rally at the health ministry next month to oppose the change and the attempt to make it a criminal offense again to consume or sell cannabis.",Thailand became the first country in Asia to decriminalise cannabis in 2022.

US President Donald Trump paused for an emotional moment with a Ukrainian reporter, who asked whether they would supply Patriot missiles in the war against Moscow, after she revealed that her husband is currently serving on the front lines.At the closing press conference of the NATO Summit in The Hague, BBC Ukraine correspondent Myroslava Petsa questioned the president about potential US sales of anti-air missile systems to Ukraine, noting Russia's intense military campaign against her country.Before addressing her question, Trump asked Petsa: “Are you living, yourself, now in Ukraine?”“My husband is there,” she said. “And me with the kids, I’m in Warsaw [Poland], actually. Because he wanted me to.""Is your husband a soldier?” Trump asked, to which Petsa answered: “He is.”“He’s there now?” the president asked again, with Petsa responding affirmatively. Trump responded, “Wow, that’s rough stuff, right? That’s tough.”Turning to her original question, the president acknowledged that Ukraine was eager to acquire Patriot systems and said,we’re going to see if we can make some available.He noted the US had recently provided the systems to Israel and called them “100% effective. Hard to believe how effective. And they do want that more than any other thing, as you probably know.”“That’s a very good question,"" Trump told Petsa and added that he wished a lot of luck.

SEOUL: North Korea next week will open a signature tourist site on its east coast that it called a prelude to a new era in its tourism industry, though there is no word on when the country will fully reopen its borders to foreign visitors.The Wonsan-Kalma coastal tourist zone has hotels and other accommodations for nearly 20,000 guests who can swim in the sea, play sports and other recreation activities and eat at restaurants and cafeterias on site, state media said.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un toured the site and cut the inaugural tape at a lavish ceremony Tuesday, the official Korean Central News Agency reported Thursday. He said its construction would be recorded as ""one of the greatest successes this year"" and called the site ""the proud first step"" toward realizing the government's policy of developing tourism, according to KCNA.The Wonsan-Kalma zone will begin service for domestic tourists next Tuesday, KCNA said. But it didn't say when it will start receiving foreign tourists.Kim has been pushing to make the country a tourism hub as part of efforts to revive the ailing economy, and the Wonsan-Kalma zone is one of his most talked-about tourism projects. KCNA reported North Korea will confirm plans to build large tourist sites in other parts of the country, too.But North Korea hasn't fully lifted the travel curbs, including a ban on foreign tourists, that were imposed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.Starting from February 2024, North Korea has been accepting Russian tourists amid the booming military and other partnerships between the two countries, but Chinese group tours, which made up more than 90 percent of visitors before the pandemic, remain stalled.In February this year, a small group of international tourists visited the country for the first time in five years, but tourist agencies said in March that their tours to North Korea were paused.","The Wonsan-Kalma coastal tourist zone has hotels and other accommodations for nearly 20,000 guests who can swim in the sea.

Richard Gerald Jordan, the longest-serving prisoner on Mississippi’s death row, nearly 49 years after he kidnapped and killed Edwina Marter in a failed ransom plot was executed by lethal injection on Wednesday.Jordan,a 79-year-old Vietnam veteran, received the injection at 6 pm in the Mississippi State Penitentiary, Parchman. Prison officials pronounced him dead at 6.16 pm.Before the drugs were administered, Jordan apologised to the victim’s family, thanked prison staff for “a humane way of doing this,” and addressed his wife, lawyer and spiritual adviser, saying, “I will see you on the other side, all of you.” His wife Marsha Jordan and lawyer Krissy Nobile wiped away tears as they witnessed the procedure.Family members of Edwina Marter did not attend. Instead, spokesman Keith Degruy read a statement on their behalf, saying the execution could not restore what was lost: “Nothing can ever change what Jordan took from us 49 years ago.”Court records show that in January 1976 Jordan telephoned Gulf National Bank in Gulfport, obtained loan officer Charles Marter’s home address from a directory, and kidnapped Marter’s wife Edwina.He shot her in a forest before calling her husband to demand US$25,000, falsely claiming she was alive.Jordan’s execution followed decades of legal challenges spanning four trials and numerous appeals. He was one of several inmates who had sued Mississippi over its three-drug execution protocol, calling it inhumane. On Monday, the US Supreme Court rejected his final appeal without comment.Defence lawyers argued Jordan suffered severe post-traumatic stress disorder from three consecutive Vietnam tours, but Governor Tate Reeves denied a clemency request that cited his wartime trauma.The execution was Mississippi’s third in the past decade and the first since December 2022. It came a day after another prisoner was put to death in Florida, contributing to what observers say could be the highest annual US execution count since 2015.","Richard Gerald Jordan, 79, was executed by lethal injection on Wednesday.

Daddy’s Home





The White House on Thursday joined the buzz around US President Donald Trump ’s latest ""Daddy"" nickname as the White House shared a one-minute video showing Trump’s arrival and interactions with Nato secretary general Mark Rutte and other leaders at the summit, set to the trackby Usher. The video appears to playfully embrace the nickname, which emerged from an exchange between Trump and Rutte.US President Donald Trump, already the most powerful man in the world, received a new nickname on Wednesday from Nato secretary general Mark Rutte -- ""Daddy.""The moment came as the two leaders were chatting ahead of the Nato summit. Trump brought up his usual comparison of Iran and Israel to fighting schoolchildren.""They've had a big fight, like two kids in a schoolyard,"" Trump said. ""You know, they fight like hell. You can't stop them. Let them fight for about two, three minutes, then it's easier to stop.""To that, Rutte responded: ""And then Daddy has to sometimes use strong language.""Rutte was referring to Trump’s angry reaction earlier in the day at the White House, where the president was visibly upset about the possibility of the Iran-Israel ceasefire falling apart.""The two countries have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the fuck they're doing, do you understand that?"" Trump told reporters.Trump laughed at Rutte’s ""Daddy"" remark and acknowledged the use of his unexpected expletive. ""Everyone said 'Well, you have to use a certain word',"" he said.When asked later about the nickname, Trump said he didn’t mind it. ""He did it very affectionately,"" Trump said. ""Daddy, you're my daddy.""The exchange also drew laughter from US secretary of state Marco Rubio, who was present when Trump responded to Rutte’s comment.Trump, known for fiery remarks but not frequent public swearing, surprised many with the language he used.Rutte, meanwhile, made extra efforts to keep Trump engaged during what could have been a tense Nato summit. From shortening the schedule to hosting Trump at the king’s royal palace, Rutte has earned another title of his own, the ""Trump Whisperer.""","US President Donald Trump received a new nickname on Wednesday from Nato secretary general Mark Rutte -- ""Daddy"" The White House shared a one-minute video showing Trump’s arrival and interactions with Rutte and other leaders at the summit, set to the trackby Usher.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122081798,imgsize-1419563,width-400,resizemode-4/122081798.jpg"

Now, his meticulous documentation of the damage using a drone helps to rebuild it.""When I first came back, I was shocked by the extent of the destruction,"" said Mohammed, 34.Walking through his devastated village of Tal Mardikh, in Syria's northwestern Idlib province, he said he could not recognise ""anything, I couldn't even find my parents' home"".Nearly half of Tal Mardikh's 1,500 homes have been destroyed and the rest damaged, mainly due to bombardment by the former Syrian army.Mohammed, who in 2019 fled the bombardment to near the Turkish border, first returned days after an Islamist led offensive toppled longtime ruler Bashar al Assad in December.The architect, now based in Idlib city, had documented details of Tal Mardikh's houses and streets before fleeing, and afterwards used his drone to document the destruction.When he returned, he spent two weeks carefully surveying the area, going from home to home and creating an interactive map showing the detailed conditions of each house.""We entered homes in fear, not knowing what was inside, as the regime controlled the area for five years,"" he said.Under the blazing sun, Mohammed watched as workers restored a house in Tal Mardikh, which adjoins the archaeological site of Ebla, the seat of one of ancient Syria's earliest kingdoms.His documentation of the village helped gain support from Shafak, a Turkey-based non-governmental organisation which agreed to fund the reconstruction and rehabilitation of 434 out of 800 damaged homes in Tal Mardikh.The work is expected to be completed in August, and includes the restoration of two wells and sanitation networks, at a cost of more than one million dollars.- 'Full of hope' -Syrians have begun returning home after Assad's ouster and following nearly 14 years of civil war that killed over half a million people and displaced millions of others internally and abroad.According to the United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR, more than 600,000 Syrians had returned home from abroad, while around 1.5 million internally displaced people have gone back to their regions of origin.The agency estimates that up to 1.5 million Syrians from abroad and two million internally displaced people could return by the end of this year.Around 13.5 million currently remain displaced internally or abroad, according to UNHCR figures for May.In Tal Mardikh, Alaa Gharib, 45, is among only a few dozen residents who have come back.""I lived in tents for seven years, and when liberation came, I returned to my village,"" said Gharib, whose home is among those set for restoration.He is using a blanket as a makeshift door for his house which had ""no doors, no windows, nothing"".After Western sanctions were lifted, Syria's new authorities are hoping for international support for post-war reconstruction, which the UN estimates could cost more than $400 billion.Efforts have so far been limited to individuals or charities, with the government yet to launch a reconstruction campaign.Architect Mohammed said his dream was ""for the village to be rebuilt, for people and life to return"".He expressed hope to ""see the Syria we dream of... the Syria full of hope, built by its youth"".","Nearly half of Tal Mardikh's 1,500 homes have been destroyed and the rest damaged.

A US federal judge on Wednesday ordered the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia , the Salvadoran national who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador by the Donald Trump administration in March, in a case which made global headlines.However, Abrego Garcia, who was brought back earlier this month to face federal criminal charges in two counts of alleged human smuggling, will spend at least a few more days in jail, while attorneys spar over whether prosecutors have the power to prevent him from being deported again.Ordering a conditional release of the 29-year-old, federal judge Barbara Holmes admitted that once released, he would land in the custody of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) - an argument his legal team repeatedly made during the hearing.""I have no reservations about my ability to direct the local US attorney’s office. (However) I don’t think I have any authority over ICE,"" news agency AP quoted Holmes as saying.The judge, who previously ruled that Abrego Garcia has a right to be freed, did not say when she would file the release order, but it will not happen before Friday afternoon.Meanwhile, federal prosecutors tried to stay Holmes’ release ruling, but it was denied by another federal judge, who wrote that the government was asking the court to “save it from itself” in a situation which was “completely of its own making.”The human trafficking charges against Abrego Garcia stem from a 2022 traffic stop for speeding in Tennessee.

Operation Midnight Hammer: US state secy Marco Rubio denies limited damage reports; says Iran now 'much further away from nukes',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/operation-midnight-hammer-us-state-secy-marco-rubio-denies-limited-damage-reports-says-iran-now-much-further-away-from-nukes/articleshow/122077507.cms,"US secretary of state Marco Rubio (AP)





US secretary of state Marco Rubio said on Wednesday that Iran is “much further away from a nuclear weapon.”In an interview with news portal Politico on the sidelines of the Nato summit in The Hague, Rubio offered a more nuanced assessment of US airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities earlier this week, in contrast with his boss President Trump’s assertions at the same summit, that Iran’s Fardo, Natanz and Isfahan sites have been “completely obliterated. ”“The bottom line is, they are much further away from a nuclear weapon today than they were before the president took this bold action,” Rubio said. “That’s the most important thing to understand, significant, very significant, substantial damage was done to a variety of different components, and we’re just learning more about it.”The interview comes in the backdrop of a leaked initial assessment by the Pentagon's defense intelligence agency, first reported by CNN earlier this week, which suggested US strikes may have left key parts of Iran's nuclear facilities intact, setting the program back only by months.The US intelligence community is expected to release further assessments in the coming days and weeks, though differing analyses are common among the various spy agencies.Rubio rejected the media reports as “false,” saying they failed to present the complete picture.“I hate commenting on these stories, because often the first story is wrong and the person putting it out there has an agenda,” he said. “That story is a false story, and it’s one that really shouldn’t be rereported because it doesn’t accurately reflect what’s happening.”While Trump has hinted at regime change in Iran on social media, Rubio clarified that it is not the objective of the US government.“The world is filled with regimes I don’t like and the president doesn’t like, and a lot of us wish didn’t exist. The United States’ job is not to go around and set up governments for every country,” he said.“Our national security issue with Iran is with a clerical regime that wants nuclear weapons so they can threaten us, threaten Israel today, threaten us tomorrow. And the president’s made clear that’s not going to happen.”Rubio went on to add that Trump views regime change as a likely outcome if Iran’s leadership stays on its current path.Rubio noted that although Trump considers a range of views and advice, “once the president makes a decision, his instincts are uncanny, and we have to appreciate that.”“I find it curious when people argue as if somehow this is some coalition government and we all get a vote. There’s only one vote here,” Rubio said.He added: “When he says, ‘this is the direction I want to go,’ our job is not to spend all day trying to change his mind.”","US secretary of state Marco Rubio said on Wednesday that Iran is “much further away from a nuclear weapon.” Rubio offered a more nuanced assessment of US airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities earlier this week, in contrast with his boss President Trump”s assertions at the same summit.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122077526,imgsize-700364,width-400,resizemode-4/122077526.jpg"

Top US intelligence officials on Wednesday issued a strong rebuttal to leaked media reports suggesting limited damage from recent US airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear sites, asserting that the targeted facilities were in fact severely hit and would take years to rebuild.Director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard accused what she described as the “propaganda media” of selectively leaking classified assessments in a bid to discredit President Donald Trump’s handling of the strikes. In a post from her official X account, Gabbard said new intelligence confirms the “complete destruction” of Iran’s nuclear facilities at Natanz, Fordow, and Isfahan during American airstrikes earlier this week.“If the Iranians chose to rebuild, they would have to rebuild all three facilities entirely,” she wrote, adding that such a reconstruction process “would likely take years.”Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii who now serves in Trump’s cabinet, also criticised the credibility of recent news reports that downplayed the extent of the damage. She claimed that these stories were based on illegally leaked classified assessments written with “low confidence” and selectively leaked to mislead the public.Echoing her remarks, CIA director John Ratcliffe also issued a statement on X confirming that the agency had “credible intelligence”, including from trusted sources, showing that the Iranian nuclear programme had sustained serious setbacks.“Iran's nuclear facilities have been severely damaged by the recent, targeted strikes,” Ratcliffe said, noting that the CIA continues to monitor the situation and will update officials and the public as more information becomes available.Both officials directly challenged initial leaks reported by some US media outlets that suggested the strikes had left core components of the Iranian nuclear facilities intact and had set it back only by a matter of months. Ratcliffe dismissed those reports as based on illegally obtained intelligence that does not reflect the CIA’s current assessment.The statements from Gabbard and Ratcliffe mark the most assertive public response from the intelligence community since the strikes were carried out.",Director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard accused what she described as the ‘propaganda media’ of selectively leaking classified assessments.

Iran-Israel New War Erupts At UN; Tehran ‘EXPOSES’ U.S. For BOMBING Nukes | ‘Master Of Lies’





US President Donald Trump on Wednesday claimed that Israel may have sent agents to inspect Iran’s Fordo nuclear site following recent American airstrikes. He said the site suffered “total obliteration” and warned that further action would follow if Tehran were to resume uranium enrichment.While speaking to reporters at the Nato summit in The Hague, Trump said, “You know they have guys that go in there after the hit, and they said it was total obliteration.”He said that Israel is currently assessing the damage inflicted on the sites.“Israel is doing a report on it now, I understand, and I was told that they said it was total obliteration. I believe it was total obliteration, and I believe they didn’t have a chance to get anything out because we acted fast,” he added.Israeli officials, while responding to remarks made by Trump, told Kan public broadcaster, that they were not aware of any Israeli operation at Fordo nuclear site after the US strikes.Earlier in the week a leaked Pentagon intelligence report first reported by CNN, suggested that US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities might have left core components largely intact, and that Iran’s nuclear program has essentially only been set back only by months.Adding that a significant portion of Iran’s enriched uranium stockpile may have been moved out of the facilities before the bombings took place.The White House has dismissed the report's conclusions and criticized the leak.When asked by the reporters if the US would strike Iran again if Tehran were to rebuild its uranium enrichment facilities, Trump said, “Sure. But I’m not going to have to worry about that. It’s gone for years.”In response to a question about the extent of the setback to Iran’s nuclear program, Trump said, “I think it’s basically decades, because I don’t think they’ll ever do it again. I think they’ve had it. I mean, they just went through hell. They’ve had it.”“The last thing they want to do is enrich anything right now,” Trump said. “They want to recover,” he added.“They’re not going to have a bomb and they’re not going to enrich,” he stressed.Trump went on to compare the American strikes on the three Iranian nuclear sites with the nuclear bombing of Japan towards the end of world war two, “That hit ended the war. That hit ended the war. I don’t want to use an example of Hiroshima, I don’t want to use an example of Nagasaki, but that was essentially the same thing that ended that war. This ended that, this ended that war. If we didn’t take that out, they would have been fighting right now. ”“I think we’ll end up having somewhat of a relationship with Iran,” he added.",US President Donald Trump claimed that Israel may have sent agents to inspect Iran’s Fordo nuclear site following recent American airstrikes.

Is Maryland’s deportation pause order, judicial overreach?

Why sue judges instead of appealing orders?

Fight for democracy versus docket management.





The Trump administration introduced a constitutional curveball by suing the entire bench of the US District Court for the District of Maryland, 15 sitting judges, in their own courthouse over the court’s ruling in which automatically pauses any deportation from Maryland for two business days when a detainee files a fresh habeas petition.The Trump administration filed the lawsuit in Baltimore, which argued that Maryland’s standing order defied both US Supreme Court precedent on injunctive relief and the clear intent of Congress. The Justice Department labels the order an “egregious example of judicial overreach,” portraying it as yet another entry in a growing list of courtroom interventions that have hamstrung the administration’s ability to carry out its immigration agenda.The order was signed by Chief US District Judge George Russell after a prolonged legal battle over the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia—a Salvadoran national with an American wife and child—who was removed to El Salvador despite a 2019 immigration court ruling shielding him from return due to the threat of gang violence.To contest a trial court's decision, a party would need to do so within the same case or request that an appellate court overturn the ruling.""It is a shocking move by the Justice Department that is simply unprecedented,"" said Marin Levy, a professor at Duke University School of Law. ""And it seems like part of a strategic attempt to attack the courts rather than any sort of good faith litigation.""US Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that President Trump was elected to implement his policy agenda, and that continued judicial interference not only disrupts that mandate but also poses a serious threat to the integrity of the democratic process.""Every unlawful order entered by the district courts robs the Executive Branch of its most scarce resource: time to put its policies into effect,"" the Justice Department stated in the lawsuit. ""In the process, such orders diminish the votes of the citizens who elected the head of the Executive Branch.""For the judiciary, it is a stress test of institutional independence. Do judges, like other litigants, have to defend themselves in court for interpreting the law?Read: Court to rule on release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, man mistakenly deported to El Salvador; may face possible ICE custody","The Trump administration sued the entire bench of the US District Court for the District of Maryland, 15 sitting judges, in their own courthouse.

Education department vs California





After their feud over deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles amid violent street protests against immigration raids, the Donald Trump administration and California are feuding again - this time over the state's violation of Title IX, a federal law.Responding to the federal education department's allegation against the state of violating Title IX, the office of governor Gavin Newsom posted a GIF of education secretary Linda McMahon from her professional wrestling days.McMahon is the wife of former World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) owner Vince McMahon and made several appearances for the company, mostly as an authority figure.

However, the organizers awarded gold and silver medals to both Hernandez and other competitors who would have won medals had she not participated. It was the first time such a rule change was made.In one of the earliest decisions of his second term, which began in January, President Donald Trump had signed an executive order to keep ""men out of women's sports.""","California governor's office posted a GIF of education secretary Linda McMahon from her professional wrestling days.

'War's over; talks next'





Iran said its nuclear installations were ""badly damaged"" by US airstrikes, the first such comments by Tehran as debate grows over how much the bombardment managed to dent the Islamic Republic's atomic programme.""Our nuclear installations have been badly damaged, that's for sure,"" foreign ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei told Al Jazeera TV in an interview on Wednesday.Baghaei did not give further details and said authorities were still assessing the situation on the ground. He added that the US attacks were a ""detrimental blow"" to international law and the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to which Iran is a signatory.The comments are the first time an Iranian official has addressed the scope of damage caused by the June 22 strikes which involved US attacks on three nuclear facilities in Iran.The comments came hours after US President Trump disputed a US intelligence report that said the attacks had limited impact on Iran's nuclear programme below ground.An assessment from the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency said the bombing likely didn't cripple the core components stored underground including centrifuges, according to people familiar with its contents.Commenting on the intelligence leak, Trump said the report was ""very inconclusive"" but that he still believed the sites were demolished. ""The intelligence says we don't know,"" he told reporters at a Nato summit in the Hague. ""It could have been very severe. That's what the intelligence says. So I guess that's correct, but I think we can take that we don't know. It was very severe. It was obliteration.""Trump said the US would hold a meeting with Iran next week but cast doubt on the need for a diplomatic agreement, citing the damage that the US bombing had done to its key nuclear sites. He said the conflict was effectively ""over"" after the US mission - though he also warned: ""Can it start again? I guess someday it can. It could maybe start soon.""","Iran says its nuclear installations were ""badly damaged"" by US airstrikes.

United States President Donald Trump on Wednesday hinted that they might ease the Iran oil sanctions to help rebuild the country, while maintaining its maximum pressure campaign on Iran, including oil sale restrictions.""They're going to need money to put that country back into shape. We want to see that happen,"" Trump stated during a Nato Summit news conference when questioned about the possible relaxation of Iranian oil sanctions, Reuters reported.Following Israel and Iran's agreement to a ceasefire, Trump suggested that China could proceed with Iranian oil purchases. However, the White House subsequently clarified that this statement did not suggest any modification to existing US sanctions.The Trump administration previously implemented multiple sanctions affecting China's independent ""teapot"" refineries and port terminal operators due to their Iranian oil purchases.In conversation with CNBC, Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff explained that Trump's statement regarding china's oil purchases from Iran was intended to demonstrate willingness for cooperation with China, rather than causing economic harm. China, as Iran's primary crude oil customer, has consistently opposed Trump's sanctions on the oil trade.""We're interested in working together with you in unison, and hopefully that becomes a signal to the Iranians,"" Witkoff said.","US President Donald Trump hinted that they might ease the Iran oil sanctions to help rebuild the country.

Anthony Bernal, the top aide to Jill Biden , abruptly withdrew from his scheduled interview with the House Oversight Committee which is probing the alleged cognitive decline former first lady's spouse, ex-US President Joe Biden.Bernal's refusal to appear - his interview was scheduled for Thursday - was condemned by Oversight chairman James Comer of President Donald Trump's Republican Party. Earlier this month, Trump ordered an investigation into Biden's ""cognitive decline,"" which allegedly occurred while the latter was still in office.Now that the White House has waived executive privilege, it’s abundantly clear that Anthony Bernal – Jill Biden’s so-called ‘work husband’ – never intended to be transparent about Joe Biden’s cognitive decline and the ensuing cover-up,. With no privilege left to hide behind, Mr. Bernal is now running scared, desperate to bury the truth. The American people deserve answers and accountability, and the Oversight Committee will not tolerate this obstruction,"" Comer said in an Oversight Committee statement, adding that he will issue a subpoena (summons) to compel Bernal to appear before the panel.The statement also noted that following the White House's decision, Bernal's legal team informed the committee would not appear for the interview, having previously confirmed he would.He is among nine former Joe Biden staffers whose executive privilege was revoked by the White House - this means that they will have to answer the Oversight panel's questions about their private conversations with Biden, unless they or the Democrat himself try to challenge the decision in court.However, people close to Bernal said he has only requested that his testimony be rescheduled.""Calling this a 'refusal' is misleading, when there was simply a request to reschedule the interview,"" they told US website Axios.","Anthony Bernal, the top aide to Jill Biden, abruptly withdrew from his scheduled interview with the House Oversight Committee.
