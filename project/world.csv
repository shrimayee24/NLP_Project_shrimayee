Yes No

NEW DELHI: An image of Jesus Christ inside a 'Vatican City-themed' Durga Puja pandal in Ranchi was replaced on Friday with that of Lord Krishna.The development came following objections raised by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP). The VHP alleged that the marquee, organised by R R Sporting Club at Ratu Road, was made to ""hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus"" and encourage conversion. The organisers had rejected these charges earlier on Thursday.The club’s patron Vicky Yadav said the decision was taken by the puja committee members and not due to protests by any section, reports news agency PTI. “It was not due to the protest by a certain section but by our committee members to show all religions on the same platform,” he said. He said that European-style statues placed outside the pandal were retained.Yadav claimed that the design aimed to promote peace and brotherhood. ""India stands for religious harmony. If that doesn’t exist, then why not just declare this a Hindu nation?"" he asked, showing videos of Prime Minister Narendra Modi visiting churches abroad during official trips.He said the idea was inspired by India’s multi-faith culture and that the club promotes Sanatan Dharma..""We have been organising Durga Puja for the last 50 years, and every year we make pandals based on certain themes. This year, we decided to replicate the Durga Puja pandal made by Sreebhumi Sporting Club in Kolkata in 2022 on the theme of Vatican City,"" Yadav said.VHP national spokesperson Vinod Bansal had expressed concern on Thursday on X, saying, ""This has been done with an objective to hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus and aimed at encouraging religious conversion. If the organising committee of this Durga Puja pandal is so interested in secularism, I would ask them to display a photograph of a Hindu God or Goddess at any event organised by the Church or at Madrasas in Ranchi.

Charlie Kirk’s death and wider reactions in the U.S.

“beat the hell out of radical left lunatics.”

Stephen A. Smith strongly criticized United States President Donald Trump for his response to the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk . Smith, who spoke on his Straight Shooter with Stephen A. show on September 27, 2025, said Trump was wrong to quickly blame “the Left” after the incident. Kirk, who was the founder of Turning Point USA, was shot on September 10, 2025, while speaking at a public debate on the campus of Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. Smith said Trump’s words were “irresponsible” and only made the country more divided.On his SiriusXM radio show, Stephen A. Smith spoke with anger about Donald Trump’s reaction.Smith accused Trump of making things worse at a time when people were grieving. “You’ve contributed as the president of the United States to alarming excessiveness. From a behavioral standpoint, it permeates throughout this country, and you don’t seem to care,” Smith said on his show.Donald Trump, who called Charlie Kirk a close ally, had told supporters that “radical left lunatics” were responsible for the murder. He said this during a speech just one day after the attack. Trump also promised that Kirk would be honored with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.Smith argued that such comments from a national leader spread fear and deepened political fights instead of calming the situation. He said Trump should have chosen words that united people instead of pointing fingers so quickly.Charlie Kirk, only 31 years old, was shot and killed on September 10, 2025, at Utah Valley University.

NEW DELHI: Taking a veiled dig at actor-politician Vijay, deputy chief minister Udhayanidhi Stalin said he does not limit his campaigning or party work to Saturdays. Without naming TVK workers, he also remarked that they lacked any understanding of the party’s ideology.Udhayanidhi, DMK youth wing secretary, expressed confidence that the Congress party, a key ally, would continue to remain part of the alliance, without directly naming it.The DMK leader targeted AIADMK chief Edappadi K Palaniswami and said that all that the Leader of Opposition now remembers is BJP top leader Amit Shah and that he has forgotten even AIADMK founder leader MG Ramachandran.Udhayanidhi said he is usually on an official tour 4-5 days a week and tours on Sundays as well. ""I do not come out only on every Saturday,"" he said to thunderous applause at a DMK party functionaries meeting here on Friday.Further, the deputy CM said he does not look at the day of the week to do his work and covers all the districts.Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) chief Vijay, who began his state-wide tour for the 2026 Assembly elections on September 13, has so far campaigned only on Saturdays.In the coming days, he is expected to include select Sundays in his schedule as well.Vijay explained that the Saturday-only arrangement was intended to avoid disturbing people during working days and to reach them over the weekend when they could spare some time.In the workers meeting, Udhayanidhi urged cadres to put aside ""little bitterness"" among them and be together and function as ""Kalaignar Ani (late DMK patriarch M Karunanidhi's team).""For the next 6 months, office-bearers should meet people daily and the campaign should be speeded up. ""Thinnai pracharam"" (Door-to-door campaign) must be taken up and the DMK regime's achievements must be explained to the public.Targeting the TVK and without naming it directly, the Deputy CM said: ""Some parties have been newly floated and members of such outfits have no idea about ideology; there is no idea about what the ideology is.""DMK office-bearers should, hence, campaign on the party's ideology and the sacrifices made by the party for the sake of securing state's rights and the Tamil language.""You must reach out to the youths on our ideology, will you do it? In particular, you must talk to students; both men and women as they appear to have no idea about ideology. DMK is not a party that was founded merely for the sake of fighting elections. It is a party that was founded to fight for the rights of the people,"" he said.Chief minister MK Stalin has a very long stint in public life, stretching to about 60 years and it was marked by a string of struggles and there is no other leader who could be compared to him.Mocking at Palaniswami, Udhayanidhi claimed that the AIADMK chief has forgotten the founder-leader of his own party and that he has ""forgotten the face"" of party founder M G Ramachandran.The DMK leader alleged mockingly: ""Palaniswami has not only forgotten his party, but he has also forgotten his party's founder leader. The only face visible to him now is Union Minister Amit Shah's face. Even if he looks at MGR's face in an image, Palaniswami will only be reminded of Amit Shah. That is the level of training the BJP has given to him.""When the AIADMK was defeated in the 2021 Assembly election, it blamed the BJP for its defeat and eventually walked out of the alliance.Later, following a revival of ties in April this year, Palaniswami claimed that the AIADMK itself was protected by the BJP.Alluding to signals from key ally Congress that it will be demanding more seats in the 2026 Assembly election and against the background of actor-politician Vijay offering a share in power to any party that joins forces with the TVK, the Deputy CM, without naming Congress directly said, ""there is no need to bother, the hand will always be with us,""Further, Udhayanidhi asserted that issues in this connection would be resolved by ""Thalaivar (party chief Stalin).""","Deputy chief minister Udhayanidhi Stalin said he does not limit his campaigning or party work to Saturdays.

Israeli military transfers data as Microsoft cuts access





Microsoft has cut off cloud computing and AI services to an Israeli military intelligence unit after an investigation revealed the technology was being used for mass surveillance of Palestinian civilians. The tech giant made the decision following a Guardian investigation that exposed how Israel's Unit 8200 stored millions of intercepted Palestinian phone calls on Microsoft's Azure platform.Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and vice chair, announced the termination in an internal memo to employees, stating the company found ""evidence that supports elements of The Guardian's reporting."" The blocked services include cloud storage and AI technologies that Unit 8200 had used to collect and analyze up to ""a million calls an hour"" from Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.An Israeli security official downplayed the impact, telling CNN there is ""no damage to the operational capabilities of the IDF."" Neither the Israel Defense Forces nor the Ministry of Defense responded to requests for comment about the service termination.The No Azure for Apartheid group, which includes of Microsoft employees, had been pressured Microsoft for over a year through protests and demonstrations, called the decision a significant win.""Today's news is a significant and unprecedented win for the campaign and our organizing,"" said Hossam Nasr, an organizer with the group, noting Microsoft became ""the first US tech company to stop the sale of some technologies to the Israeli military since the start of the genocide in Gaza. ""However, the activist group said the action doesn't go far enough, as Microsoft only disabled services to a single unit while ""the vast majority of Microsoft's contract with the Israeli military remains intact."" The group vowed to continue organizing until all their demands are met.The company said it applies its anti-surveillance principles globally and has maintained this stance for over two decades, with Smith noting that customer privacy commitments prevented Microsoft from accessing the surveillance data directly during its investigation.Intelligence sources told the Guardian that Unit 8200 quickly moved the massive data trove out of Microsoft's Dutch servers within days of the original investigation's publication in August. The unit reportedly plans to transfer the surveillance data to Amazon Web Services, though Amazon has not responded to requests for comment.Smith emphasized that Microsoft ""does not provide technology to facilitate mass surveillance of civilians"" and noted the decision doesn't affect the company's broader relationship with Israel, including cybersecurity work. However, the termination raises questions about Israel's policy of storing sensitive military intelligence on foreign-owned cloud platforms.",Microsoft has cut off cloud computing and AI services to an Israeli military intelligence unit.

US military officials are drawing up plans to strike drug traffickers inside Venezuela, with potential operations possibly beginning in the coming weeks, four sources familiar with the matter told NBC News.The sources, including two US officials involved in planning and two others briefed on the discussions, said US President Donald Trump has not yet approved the strikes.The proposals under discussion reportedly focus on drone strikes against suspected drug traffickers, their leadership networks, and drug-processing labs, according to NBC News. Such strikes would mark a sharp escalation in Washington’s military campaign against alleged drug smuggling routes linked to Venezuela.In recent weeks, the US military struck at least three boats believed to be carrying narcotics from Venezuela. Trump later said on Truth Social that the vessels posed a threat to Americans. While US officials have not confirmed that drugs were present on all the boats, Dominican authorities and US embassy officials said narcotics were recovered after one incident.According to officials familiar with the deliberations, the escalation partly reflects frustration in Washington that Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has not, in the Trump administration’s view, acted decisively to stem narcotics flows out of his country.Some US officials also expressed disappointment that the strikes have not weakened Maduro’s hold on power. “The White House has faced more pushback on the boat strikes than it anticipated,” one official told NBC News, adding that it is weighing next steps carefully.A senior administration official underscored that Trump remains determined: “The president is prepared to use every element of American power to stop drugs from flooding into our country and to bring those responsible to justice.”","US military officials are drawing up plans to strike drug traffickers inside Venezuela.

Poll Do you think more security measures should be implemented at public venues like restaurants? Yes, definitely No, it's not necessary





Three people were killed and eight others injured after a shooter opened fire from a passing boat at a popular waterfront restaurant in Southport, North Carolina, on Saturday night, authorities said.According to the New York Post, the incident took place around 9:30 pm (local time) at the American Fish Company, located in the Southport Yacht Basin along the Intracoastal Waterway.Officials said the unidentified vessel pulled up to the dockside restaurant and fired into a crowd of diners before fleeing the scene, prompting an “active shooter” alert for the area, as per Daily Mail.“One person of interest is being questioned in relation to the deadly incident,” city officials were quoted as saying by Star News, though no arrests have been confirmed as of Saturday night.The boat was described as a “white center console” vessel.Southport town authorities issued urgent warnings for residents to stay indoors and report any suspicious activity. A city Facebook post said, “There are reports of an active shooter in the Southport Yacht Basin. There is an unknown number of injuries. Avoid the area and remain in your homes. Please report any suspicious activity immediately to 911”, reported CBS 17.American Fish Company, which often features live music, had the band Bacon Grease scheduled to perform from 7 to 10 pm on Saturday.The restaurant bills itself as one of Southport’s “favorite hangouts”.Authorities, including the Brunswick County Sheriff’s Office and the Southport Police Department, are coordinating the response, along with multiple other law enforcement agencies across the county.“Please keep all those affected, as well as our first responders, in your thoughts and prayers,” the sheriff’s office said in a statement, as cited by CBS 17.Southport, located along the Cape Fear River near Fort Fisher, is about 10 miles southwest of Wilmington.The investigation is ongoing as law enforcement works to determine the circumstances of the shooting and locate any additional suspects.","Three people were killed and eight others injured after a shooter opened fire at a popular waterfront restaurant in Southport, North Carolina, on Saturday night.

Arizona floods: At least four dead in torrential rains; rescue efforts underway,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/arizona-floods-at-least-four-dead-in-torrential-rains-rescue-efforts-underway/articleshow/124189941.cms,"Arizona floods: At least four dead in torrential rains; rescue efforts under way





At least four people died in central Arizona after heavy rainfall caused flash flooding, officials said Saturday, with the hardest-hit areas including the historic mining town of Globe, about 88 miles east of Phoenix.Residents were forced to climb onto rooftops as floodwaters swept through downtown streets, overturning vehicles and scattering about 1,000 propane tanks from a local distributorship, as per news agency AP According to NBC News, Carl Melford, Gila County emergency manager, confirmed three deaths in Globe.“We now have a massive search and rescue underway,” he was quoted as saying by AP, noting that authorities were investigating reports of possibly missing residents.In Scottsdale, the fourth victim was identified as 38-year-old Ander Polanco, whose vehicle had been submerged in approximately eight feet of fast-moving water on Friday evening; his body was found Saturday after the waters receded, reported NBC News.The flooding in Globe, a city of around 7,250 residents, occurred after roughly 2.5 inches (6.4 centimetres) of rain fell within 24 hours.Another storm moved in on Saturday, temporarily halting search efforts due to high-flowing creeks.Streets in the nearby mining town of Miami were also flooded, though no injuries were reported there, according to Melford.Mayor Al Gameros said the damage to downtown Globe was extensive, with buildings compromised and hazardous materials, including propane tanks, strewn across the area.“Our primary, again, is search and rescue,” he said. Officials cautioned residents to avoid floodwaters, as volunteer interference could hinder rescue dogs from locating victims.Social media videos showed vehicles being swept away, some smashed against poles, with muddy water carrying debris through the city.Mike Stapleton, Globe’s vice mayor, described reports of trapped residents, including a pregnant woman who had to swim out of a flooded restaurant, and called the devastation “just unbelievable”.Council member Freddy Rios said, “This is something that we could never even imagine, and here we are living it”.Rescue operations included teams from neighbouring counties and the state.Authorities also evacuated about 20 tourists stranded on the Havasupai Indian Reservation, including at scenic Havasu Falls.The National Weather Service reported between 1 and 2 inches of rainfall across metropolitan Phoenix on Friday, including 1.6 inches at the city airport, the highest single-day total in seven years.Hail larger than an inch was observed in some areas, and some self-driving vehicles at Phoenix airport were stuck in floodwaters.Globe city council members declared a state of emergency and urged residents to stay away from downtown until it was deemed safe.Authorities were checking vehicles among debris and assessing structural damage to ensure bridges over local creeks remained stable, as per the New York Times.With further storms expected, officials warned of continued flash flooding risks across Globe, Miami, and neighbouring communities, emphasising the importance of remaining in safe locations until conditions improved.","Floodwaters swept through downtown streets, overturning vehicles and scattering about 1,000 propane tanks from a local distributorship.

"'Snapback' over nuclear programme: UN hits Iran with sanctions; economy, tensions likely to worsen",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/snapback-over-nuclear-programme-un-hits-iran-with-sanctions-economy-tensions-likely-to-worsen/articleshow/124189898.cms,"File photo (Picture credit: AP)





The United Nations has reimposed wide-ranging sanctions on Iran over its nuclear programme, further tightening the squeeze on the Islamic Republic as it grapples with soaring food prices, currency collapse and fears of renewed conflict with Israel and the United States.According to news agency Associated Press (AP), the sanctions—revived through a “snapback” mechanism from the 2015 nuclear accord—took effect early Sunday.They will freeze Iranian assets abroad, block arms deals, and penalise Tehran’s ballistic missile development.France, Germany and the United Kingdom triggered the snapback after accusing Iran of restricting monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency and failing to account for its growing stockpile of highly enriched uranium.Iran has long maintained its programme is peaceful, though the West and the IAEA believe it had organised weapons work until 2003. As per AP, Iran still holds uranium enriched up to 60% purity, close to weapons-grade levels, enough to produce several bombs should it decide to pursue weaponisation.The economic toll is already severe. The rial hit record lows, pushing up prices of staples like rice and meat.Inflation officially stands at 34.5%, with food costs up more than 50%.“Every day I see new higher prices for cheese, milk and butter. I cannot omit them like fruits and meat because my kids are too young to be deprived,” said Tehran resident Sima Taghavi, as cited by AP.Another, identified only as Sina, described conditions as worse than during the 1980s Iran-Iraq war, “For my generation, it’s always either too late or too early—our dreams are slipping away.”The measures mark the first time in a decade that UN sanctions have returned. US secretary of state Marco Rubio urged Iran to “accept direct talks, held in good faith,” while Britain, France and Germany said they remain open to diplomacy.Germany’s foreign minister Johann Wadephul told the UN General Assembly that “Iran must never acquire a nuclear weapon,” stressing sanctions were triggered due to Tehran’s non-compliance.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian rejected US proposals to surrender enriched uranium for limited reprieve, calling them unacceptable. Tehran recalled its envoys from Britain, France and Germany in protest.Russia, however, said it would not enforce the sanctions, with foreign minister Sergey Lavrov describing them as “blackmail and pressure.”Meanwhile, fears of escalation loom. As per AP, missile sites destroyed during the 12-day war in June appear to be rebuilt, raising risks of renewed clashes.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the UN that sanctions should not be delayed and signalled Israel could take further military action.As per AFP, Iranians are rushing to buy gold as the rial plunged to 1.12 million to the dollar on the black market. One engineer, Dariush, was quoted by AFP as saying, “The impact of the renewed sanctions is already evident: the exchange rate is increasing, and this is leading to higher prices. Our standard of living is much lower than two or three years ago.”Human rights groups also warn of intensifying repression. Executions in 2025 have already surpassed 1,000, the highest since 1988, amid unrest over economic hardships and political demands.With sanctions back in force and diplomacy uncertain, the Iranian people face what one psychologist described to Hamshahri newspaper as a society “exhausted and unmotivated”—caught between international isolation, internal crackdowns, and fears of another war.","The United Nations has reimposed wide-ranging sanctions on Iran over its nuclear programme.

US President Donald Trump on Saturday launched a fresh attack on the FBI, claiming that hundreds of undercover agents were secretly present during the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot — contradicting public statements made by the bureau’s former director Christopher Wray.Trump, citing a report from The Blaze, alleged that the FBI had deployed 274 plainclothes agents into the crowds in Washington, DC, that day, though it remains unclear if all were inside the Capitol crowd.”“It was just revealed that the FBI had secretly placed, against all Rules, Regulations, Protocols, and Standards, 274 FBI Agents into the Crowd just prior to, and during, the January 6th Hoax,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.He further accused Wray of misleading lawmakers. “This is different from what Director Christopher Wray stated, over and over again! I want to know who each and every one of these so-called ‘Agents’ are, and what they were up to on that now ‘Historic’ Day,” Trump said.He added, “Christopher Wray, the then Director of the FBI, has some major explaining to do. That’s two in a row, Comey and Wray, who got caught LYING”.The justice department’s inspector general report last year stated it found “no evidence” of undercover FBI employees in the protest crowds or at the Capitol.However, the same report confirmed that 26 confidential informants were present, including four who entered the Capitol without authorisation, as per the New York Post.Democrats pushed back swiftly. House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries said on MSNBC that Trump was “lying to the American people about the events of January 6,” accusing him of inciting the violence and now attempting to deflect blame, reported CNN.The renewed focus comes as Trump’s allies in Congress have formed a subcommittee to investigate federal involvement in the riot.Rep Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga), who chairs the panel, said earlier this month, “With that many paid informants being in the crowd, we want to know how many were in the crowd, how many were in the building, but I also want to know, were they paid to inform or instigate?”, as per the New York Post.The controversy coincided with the indictment of former FBI director James Comey on charges of making false statements to Congress.Trump, who previously pardoned January 6 rioters, has portrayed the prosecutions as part of a campaign against “Great American Patriots” and vowed to expose what he described as “dirty cops and crooked politicians.”","Donald Trump accuses FBI of lying over agents’ role in January 6 riot.

When was Celeste's body put inside D4vd's car?

Was Celeste's body already there?

Did Celeste die around August 27? Or, was her body put inside later?







Shocking details about D4vd's Tesla, where teen Celeste Rivas Hernandez's body was found, have been revealed, complicating the timeline of the case. LA Times reported that the Tesla had been parked on Bluebird Avenue so long that some residents complained about it in late August, leading to the car being ticketed.This complicates the most crucial question of the investigation: when did Celeste die? According to the new timeline, a parking enforcement officer narked the Tesla, noting the position of its tires on August 27.On September 3, the officer issued a citation to the Tesla for violating the 72-hour parking ordinance.On September 5, the Tesla was impounded and towed to teh Hollywood tow yard.On September 8, Celeste Rivas, the teen missing for the past year, was found dead inside the Tesla trunk, her body rotting and attracting flies.Chances are that her body was already there when the Tesla was ticketed. Private investigator Steve Fischer who is posting his findings of this highly sensational case on X shared a photo of the Tesla when it was cited for impounding. Showing the layer of dust on the vehicle, Fischer argued that Celeste's body had already been inside the car, and the car had not been touched for days.""This partially zoomed-in photo shows how much dirt was caked on the car and windshield.That kind of buildup takes time to accumulate. I believe this car was parked for a long time with her inside,"" Fischer posted.D4vd is out of the public view with all his shows canceled as he's being investigated for his girlfriend's death. There is no official confirmation on the nature of their relationship, but D4vd's friends confirmed that they thought Celeste was his girlfriend as they were staying together in a rented apartment in Hollywood Hills. Celeste was a minor and a missing person when she died, though D4vd's friends claimed they all thought Celeste was 19 years old. However, it can hardly serve as an excuse for D4vd, as they were aware that Celeste ran away from her home and that the missing complaint registered her as a teen.","Celeste Rivas Hernandez, 19, was found dead inside D4vd's Tesla on September 8.

NEW YORK: Despite being among one of the world's worst performers when it comes to democracy, and registering a high number of human rights violation cases, Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif defended the country's 'hybrid model' of governance where the army and civilian leadership work hand in glove in running the country.He made the remarks in an interview to British-American journalist Mehdi Hasan while defending Pakistan. Asif called the US democracy a ""deep state"" and tried to brush away the charges of military might in Pak governance.When asked by Hasan, ""It's a strange system you have in Pakistan. I think you've called it a hybrid model - where the military and civilian leaders effectively share power. But the military leaders are really the ones in charge, are they not? In most countries, the head of the army answers to the defence minister. In your country you, the defence minister, answer to the head of the army, don't you? Asim Munir is a more powerful person than you are. "" Khawaja Asif rejected the statements. and said: ""No, it's not like that... I'm a political appointee.""When confronted with the example of how in the US, Pete Hegseth, the secretary of war, has the power to fire American generals, but the same cannot be said for Pakistan, Asif sourly retorted, saying, ""They (US) have a different model over here.It's called deep state.""On Hasan further saying, ""In your country (Pakistan) the deep state's in charge. That's what the accusation is"", Asif put the blame on past leadership, stating, ""You can say that because of our military rulers - it is more visible...""On being further probed as to where the power lies in Pakistan, the defence minister explained it as ""hybrid"".Earlier this year, Asif had told Arab News about the 'hybrid regime' that currently runs the country, Dawn reported. The term, Dawn said, is used to describe the informal power-sharing arrangement, whereby the military holds a significant influence on the civilian leadership. ani","Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif defended the country's 'hybrid model' of governance.

Kamala Harris’ Book Tour Erupts as Pro-Palestine Protesters Confront Her Over Israel-Hamas War





US Vice President JD Vance delivered a scathing assessment of former Vice President Kamala Harris ’ 2024 presidential campaign, saying listening to her left him feeling “dumber in the process” and calling her political messaging devoid of substance.Speaking with Laura Ingraham on Fox News’ The Ingraham Angle on Friday, Vance responded to Harris’ new memoir, 107 Days, in which she recounts her brief presidential run following Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the 2024 race.Harris reportedly blamed the limited campaign window for her loss, a claim that drew sharp criticism from Vance.“My reaction is if you look at the polling, both the public and the private polling, the problem is not that Kamala’s campaign was too short, it’s that it was too long,” Vance said.“That when people actually listened to what she had to say, her polling went down and down and down. I think that if we had had a 150-day campaign, we probably would have had three additional Republican senators, and Donald Trump would have won by an even bigger landslide. Because the more people know about Kamala Harris, the more they realize there’s no substance there”, he added.Vance contrasted Harris with past Democratic figures, noting that former US presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton could articulate clear viewpoints.“Agree or disagree with Barack Obama or Bill Clinton, they actually had substance. They could actually articulate a viewpoint. I listened to Kamala Harris for 90 seconds, and I actually feel like I’ve gotten dumber in the process, and I have no idea what she actually believes,” he said.The vice president continued, warning that Harris’ challenges would persist unless she learned to clearly develop and communicate a viewpoint. “That’s the problem with Kamala Harris, and it’s gonna continue to be her problem unless she actually learns how to develop a viewpoint, articulate it for the American people. Just say what you actually believe. Don’t do this word salad, talking around in circles. It doesn’t work, and it’s why she didn’t win,” Vance said.Harris’ media tour following the release of 107 Days has reignited debate over her campaign strategy and public speaking style. Critics have noted her tendency to provide vague or convoluted answers during interviews, including a controversial 60 Minutes segment on the Israel-Hamas conflict that required clarification after editing issues, as per the Daily Caller.During the 2024 election, Trump won 312 electoral votes to Harris’ 226 and narrowly missed a majority of the popular vote. Post-election analyses revealed that Harris underperformed in several swing states and counties that previously favoured Biden, highlighting the campaign’s challenges in connecting with voters.",US Vice President JD Vance delivered a scathing assessment of former Vice President Kamala Harris’ 2024 presidential campaign.

Epstein files releasing soon? Democrat Adelita Grijalva victory secures key vote to force disclosure push,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/epstein-files-releasing-soon-democrat-adelita-grijalva-victory-secures-key-vote-to-force-disclosure-push/articleshow/124177582.cms,"Epstein Bombshell: Elon Musk & Prince Andrew’s Connection Revealed | Details





Adelita Grijalva’s win Tuesday in a special House election in southern Arizona has handed Democrats another seat in Congress and delivered the pivotal 218th signature for a discharge petition to force the Justice Department to release still-secret files related to the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein The development all but guarantees a floor vote on bipartisan legislation requiring the DOJ to post every record it holds on Epstein and his former associate Ghislaine Maxwell. The measure, co-sponsored by Rep. Thomas Massie and Rep Ro Khanna , bypasses House leadership after Speaker Mike Johnson resisted calls to schedule the bill.According to The Hill, Massie has accused GOP leaders of shielding Trump’s wealthy allies. “I do believe that Trump is not implicated,” Massie said. “I believe that Trump is trying to protect rich and powerful people who are his friends, and that is why this material is not getting released.”Grijalva, who succeeds her late father, longtime Rep Raúl Grijalva, pledged to sign the petition upon being sworn in, potentially setting up a vote as early as late October. Only a handful of discharge petitions have succeeded in recent decades, making this a rare and contentious maneuver.The milestone is also politically fraught for former president Donald Trump. As The Hill reported, Trump initially vowed to release the Epstein files but recently reversed himself, calling the controversy a “hoax” and urging his supporters to move on. On Truth Social last month, Trump posted: “Let these weaklings continue forward and do the Democrats work, don’t even think about talking of our incredible and unprecedented success, because I don’t want their support anymore!”The petition has already drawn signatures from every Democrat and three Republicans — Reps. Nancy Mace, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and Lauren Boebert. With Grijalva’s addition, the 218 threshold is reached, though GOP leaders could still attempt procedural tactics to block the measure.House Oversight Chair James Comer has argued a separate investigation under his panel is sufficient, pointing to subpoenaed files and witness interviews, including former Attorney General William Barr and ex-prosecutor Alexander Acosta. “We continue to believe the Committee’s investigative process is the most appropriate avenue,” Comer wrote last week, according to The Hill.But supporters of the discharge petition remain unconvinced, warning the DOJ is filtering evidence. “The DOJ’s curating all of that, and they’re releasing what they want to release,” Massie told The Hill. “People are going to go through [the documents] and say, ‘Hey, wait. There’s nothing new here.’ And then that will only incite people to be more upset that there’s no transparency.”According to analysis from MSNBC, attention is now shifting to the Senate, where vulnerable Republicans such as Susan Collins (Maine), John Cornyn (Texas), and Jon Husted (Ohio) may face pressure if the House vote passes. “Will they spend all their political capital to keep the Epstein files secret?” the network’s report asked, warning that the issue could become a political liability heading into 2026 races.The Epstein legislation, if passed in the House, would still need Senate approval and Donald Trump’s signature to become law. Yet advocates believe that forcing a floor vote could mark a turning point in the long campaign for disclosure.","Adelita Grijalva’s win Tuesday in a special House election in southern Arizona has handed Democrats another seat in Congress.

The executions, carried out within 18 minutes of each other, bring the total number of US executions this year to 33, the highest since 2014.In Alabama, Geoffrey West, 50, was pronounced dead at 6:22 p.m. US Central Time for the 1997 murder of Margaret Berry, 33, a mother of two, during a gas station robbery in Attalla. In his final statement, provided to USA TODAY by his attorneys, West apologized and reflected on faith, saying, ""I am at peace because I know where I am going and look forward to seeing Mrs. Berry when I get there... I urge everyone, especially young people, to find God. ""Berry's son, Will Berry, who was 11 when his mother was killed, had sought a reprieve, expressing a wish to meet West before his execution.

Who is Ian Roberts? Iowa’s largest school district superintendent arrested by ICE for living and working in US illegally,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-ian-roberts-iowas-largest-school-district-superintendent-arrested-by-ice-for-living-and-working-in-us-illegally/articleshow/124176796.cms,"‘Obey Immigration Laws Or…’: Trump’s Stark Warning After ‘Humiliating’ ICE Raid On U.S. Ally





Ian Roberts, the superintendent of Des Moines Public Schools and leader of Iowa’s largest school district, was arrested Friday by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement after fleeing into the woods during a traffic stop, shocking educators and the local community. Roberts, originally from Guyana, was in the United States illegally and had no work authorization, ICE said.He was subject to a final removal order issued in 2024.ICE said Roberts was stopped while driving his school-issued vehicle. After abandoning the car near a wooded area, he was located and taken into custody with help from Iowa State Patrol officers. Officials have not disclosed where Roberts is being held or whether he has legal representation.Phil Roeder, spokesperson for the district, said he had been scheduled to meet Roberts at a school event but received a text from him saying he could not attend. Roeder later witnessed the detention via a video call. “The district has seen nothing that would suggest that he's not a citizen,” he said.ICE reported that Roberts was carrying a loaded handgun, $3,000 in cash, and a fixed-blade hunting knife at the time of his arrest.Sam Olson, ICE regional official, said, “How this illegal alien was hired without work authorization, a final order of removal, and a prior weapons charge is beyond comprehension and should alarm the parents of that school district.”Roberts, 54, began as Des Moines superintendent in July 2023, overseeing a district with more than 30,000 students and nearly 5,000 staff. He earned a $270,000 annual base salary and holds a professional administrator license issued by the state board of educational examiners in 2023. District leaders described him as a dynamic and engaged educator.Jackie Norris, school board president, called Roberts “an integral part of our school community” who has “shown up in ways big and small.” Union leaders in Iowa said they were shocked by the arrest and praised Roberts as “a tremendous advocate for students, families, staff, and the community.”Roberts was born to immigrant parents from Guyana and grew up in Brooklyn, New York. He graduated from Coppin State University in 1998 and competed for Guyana in the 2000 Olympics. ICE said he entered the U.S. on a student visa in 1999.Court records show Roberts pleaded guilty in Pennsylvania in January 2022 to unlawfully possessing a loaded firearm in a vehicle while hunting. He was fined $100 plus court costs and said at the time he left his hunting rifle visible in his car to avoid alarming officers.This arrest follows another aggressive ICE action in Iowa on Thursday, when agents in plain clothes detained a man at a grocery store in Iowa City, prompting concerns over the agency’s approach in the state.","Ian Roberts, the superintendent of Des Moines Public Schools, was arrested Friday.

Candace's earlier theory of Israel, Bill Ackman







Candace Owens has now come up with a new conspiracy theory claiming that she now has sources confirming that Tyler Robinson was framed and he was not the person who shot and killed Charlie Kirk. Candace said everything the Feds said about the case so far and about how Tyler Robinson was caught is a lie, including that Tyler Robinson is suicidal.“I want to break this news immediately because it feels important and I think if I don’t break it immediately, something bad might happen,"" Candace said teasing a big reveal on Monday giving a weekend cliffhanger for her viewers.“Tyler Robinson is not suicidal. The entire narrative that was placed in the media about him having been suicidal is completely fictional, as are many other aspects of what we have been told… His father having “turned him in after a confession” is also complete fiction. To the contrary, Tyler Robinson maintains his innocence and has never even been to the UVU campus,” she said.“Which is why they have produced nothing other than a blurry image which Tyler’s family knows is not him,” she continued. “…The federal government is lying about absolutely everything except for the fact that it is her gun…”Candace earlier claimed that Kirk was pressured to visit Israel by hedge fund manager Bill Ackman.Candace said Ackman threatened Kirk during a high-stakes ""intervention"" in the Hamptons, weeks before the murder.Ackman called Candace out for defaming him. “For the record, at no time have I ever threatened Charlie Kirk, Turning Point or anyone associated with him,” Ackman said. “I have never blackmailed anyone, let alone Charlie Kirk. I have never offered Charlie or Turning Point any money in an attempt to influence Charlie's opinion on anything.

Poll Should Pakistan strengthen its ties with China over the United States? Yes, definitely No, we should align more with the US

China 'not worried' about Pak's flirtations with US



Awkward contradictions on Imran Khan







Pakistan's defence minister, Khawaja Asif , has once again defended his country's ""hybrid model"" of governance, insisting that the military and civilian leadership work ""by consensus"" in managing state affairs.Speaking to British-American journalist Mehdi Hasan, Asif dismissed suggestions that the army dominates Pakistan's politics, while controversially describing US democracy as a ""deep state.""When asked whether Pakistan's generals hold more power than elected ministers, Asif retorted, ""No, it's not like that. I'm a political appointee, I’m a political worker."" Pressed further with comparisons to the United States, where civilian leaders have the authority to dismiss top generals, he claimed, ""They (the US) have a different model over here. It's called deep state.""Hasan pointed out that in Pakistan, critics accuse the military of being the real decision-maker. Asif acknowledged the perception, blaming ""past military rulers"" for the image, but insisted the system was based on consensus. Asked directly who prevails if he and Army chief Asim Munir disagree, Asif said: ""It's not equal. We can agree to disagree. It is by consensus, whatever is taking place.""Earlier this year, Asif had described the hybrid arrangement as a ""practical necessity,"" saying that while not an ideal form of democracy, it was helping Pakistan manage its economic and governance crises. Local daily Dawn has reported that Asif often praises the military-civilian partnership, despite critics branding it undemocratic.Turning to geopolitics, Asif insisted Pakistan's tilt toward Washington under US President Donald Trump, with new mineral and crypto trade deals, would not jeopardise Islamabad's ties with Beijing. ""We are not worried about that, because it's a time-tested relationship with China since the late 50s. China is not worried about our flirtations or whatever you call it,"" he remarked.Highlighting defence ties, he said: ""In the past, even today and in the future also, China has been a very reliable ally. Our Air Force, submarines, planes — almost a major portion of our arms are from China, and our defence cooperation is increasing. It is much more robust than before, with China, the main reason is unreliability of other sources like the United States.""He underscored geography as another factor: ""They (China) are reliable and they are our neighbours. We share borders and we share the geography.""The interview also turned uncomfortable when Asif was confronted about his shifting claims on jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan's social media activity. At one point, he alleged Khan was operating his account from Adiala Jail. When reminded that he had earlier accused India of controlling Khan's account, Asif appeared flustered.""You just made two different allegations. Is it Imran in his prison cell or is it India?"" Hasan asked. Asif responded, ""Either he is operating from the cell or he should at least identify who is operating the jail cell.""Pressed further on evidence, Asif cited ""intelligence sources"" but refused to provide details, insisting: ""The evidence I cannot publicly disclose… but it is there.""","Pakistan's defence minister defends country's ""hybrid model"" of governance.

Washington viewed New Delhi as a good friend and partner and believed their relationship would define the 21st century.” The official added that planning continues for a summit of the Quad grouping of India, Australia, Japan and the United States, expected either later this year or early next year.Sharif also met Trump on Tuesday on the sidelines of the UNGA in a meeting hosted alongside Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, attended by leaders from Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Egypt, the UAE, and Jordan. According to Pakistan’s foreign office, “Informal exchange followed the dialogue between President Trump and leaders of eight Islamic-Arab countries, including Pakistan.” The meeting focused on exploring diplomatic, political, and humanitarian options for de-escalating the conflict in Gaza.Washington said it shared peace proposals with leaders from those countries during the meeting. Pakistan has backed Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for his claimed efforts in easing India-Pakistan tensions, although Islamabad has criticised Israel’s operations in Gaza.Donald Trump addressed the UNGA for the first time since returning to the Oval Office, claiming he had ended seven wars in seven months, including the conflict between India and Pakistan.",US President Donald Trump is expected to meet Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif at the White House on Thursday.

At least 12 people, including women and children, were injured in a bombing attack on the Quetta-bound Jaffar Express in Pakistan’s Balochistan province — the latest in a string of attacks on the train since March.Officials said the blast struck the passenger train as it passed through the Spizend area of Mastung district, causing six carriages to derail and one to overturn on Tuesday. Around 270 people were on board. Security forces rushed to the site and evacuated the injured to a nearby hospital, PTI reported.It was the second explosion in the area within 10 hours. Earlier that morning, an IED went off near the main track linking Balochistan to the rest of the country just as the Peshawar-bound Jaffar Express was preparing to leave Quetta station. That train was cleared to continue because the rails were undamaged.The Jaffar Express, which runs between Quetta and Peshawar, has repeatedly been targeted by separatist groups. On August 10, an IED derailed six coaches of the Peshawar-bound train, injuring four passengers. On August 7, a bomb near Sibi station exploded moments after the train passed; and on August 4 gunmen opened fire on its pilot engine near Kolpur, an attack later claimed by the Baloch Liberation Army.Earlier incidents this year include a remotely controlled blast in June that derailed four carriages in Jacobabad and a March hijacking in Bolan that killed 21 passengers and four security personnel before security forces killed 33 suspected militants in a follow-up operation.Rail officials said repairs to the damaged section of track would begin Wednesday under security clearance, with services temporarily suspended.","The Jaffar Express, which runs between Quetta and Peshawar, has repeatedly been targeted by separatist groups.

Taliban bans books by Women in Afghanistan's universities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/taliban-bans-books-by-women-in-afghanistans-universities/articleshow/124059652.cms,"Image used for representative purposes





The Taliban government is purging books written by women from Afghanistan's male-only university system and outlawing gender studies courses, the latest blows in a campaign against women's rights since the group returned to power four years ago.More than 600 books, many of them written by women, were included in a 50-page list of banned works. The directive was announced in a letter to universities by the Taliban's deputy higher education minister, dated to late August, and published by the Independent Persian on Thursday. The letter said the titles were in conflict with principles of Shariah, or Islamic law.A member of the committee reviewing the books later clarified the Taliban's position to BBC Afghan that ""all books authored by women are not allowed to be taught.""The ban is ""a criminal act,"" said Rahela Sidiqi, the director of The Rahela Trust, a Britain-based group that works in Afghanistan to help women and girls access education. ""It not only affects females. It also affects males. It affects society, because those books were part of the curriculums of those universities.""Alongside the book ban, the Taliban has instructed universities to drop 18 courses spanning topics from human rights and democracy to women's studies, and said more than 200 others were under review.""We know in the spring, there was a committee put together by the Ministry of Higher Education to do exactly this,"" said Lauryn Oates, the executive director of Right to Learn Afghanistan, a group based in Canada that supports human rights and education for girls and women in Afghanistan. ""This will give people the false idea that women don't write books, or that women's ideas are not worth consulting.""The list of texts and subjects being stripped, Oates said, shows that ""they really don't like political science or international relations."" But she said it was also inconsistent, adding that much of it appeared to be coming from ""individual members' personal suspicion of the subjects.""In 2022, Afghanistan's higher education commission released a report after a review of school curriculum. Among the ""deficiencies"" outlined were the promotion of foreign cultural norms, ""moral deficiencies"" and the advancement of ""un-Islamic customs and practices, such as music, television, democracy, etc.""Because the Taliban has banned women and girls from secondary and higher education, the latest wave of censorship primarily affects the curricula of male students. But Sidiqi said the step is reflective of a pattern of ""restricting women from every part of life,"" adding that the removal of women's writing reflects an attempt to ""destroy the history of their life.""The move is part of a wider overhaul of higher education, which the Taliban has pursued since returning to power as it seeks to reshape Afghan society to conform to its hard-line ideology. It has fired scores of university professors who it claims break from state values, stifled dissent on university campuses and restructured curricula to augment the amount of religious education students are required to take.Earlier this week, internet shutdowns hit several provinces of Afghanistan to curb ""misuse,"" which had the effect of curtailing the ability to attend online classes and exchange information.","More than 600 books, many of them written by women, are included in a 50-page list of banned works.

Taliban’s Fresh Threat To US President After Trump Warns Afghanistan Again

Consequences for the economy



'Dark days' ahead



End of online education for girls?







Concerns are growing in Afghanistan over tightening Taliban restrictions on fiber-optic internet access.The war-torn nation's northern Balkh province confirmed a fiber-optic internet shutdown on Tuesday after Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada imposed a complete ban on the technology.There are reports of severe disruption in other parts of the country, including the northern provinces of Kunduz, Badakhshan, Baghlan and Takhar.The Taliban leadership has not provided an official explanation, however a spokesperson for the governor of Balkh stated that the decision was taken to ""prevent immorality."" But many experts suspect the Islamic fundamentalist group wants to block critical content and preempt any protests.Data from London-based internet monitor NetBlocks show that internet usage in the affected provinces has dropped dramatically.""The disruption of the internet marks the beginning of widespread repression across Afghanistan,"" security expert Bismillah Taban told DW. ""The Taliban could expand their crackdown and evade international oversight. This is a very serious concern.""So far, mobile internet has not been affected. Traders and business owners are warning of severe consequences if this access is also restricted.In addition, prepaid cards are very expensive, and mobile internet is comparatively slow. Fiber-optic internet is primarily used by companies, banks, and government agencies.""Currently, 80% of business is conducted online. We are already facing major challenges. Don't widen the gap between the people and the government any further,"" urged Khan Jan Alokozai, vice president of the Afghan Chamber of Commerce, on X.Sayed Ahmad Shah Sadaat, who served as Afghanistan's education minister from 2016 to 2018, also warned of the potential consequences.""The fiber-optic network, which people rely on for online education, commerce, and the banking system, will negatively impact all areas of life. The Taliban have no alternative internet system. If the network is cut off, Afghanistan faces a dark time ahead,"" she told DW.""Government agencies and institutions such as passport and registration offices, customs offices, banks, and media houses are particularly affected, as they rely on fiber-optic connections. Their failure puts additional pressure on central administrative structures.""International media organisations are also sounding the alarm.""Banning broadband internet is an unprecedented escalation of censorship that will undermine journalists' work and the public's right to information,"" said Beh Lih Yi, regional director of the committee to protect journalists.""The Taliban should end their cycle of repression and unconditionally restore internet access, which is an essential tool for news gathering.""For girls and women, the decision could have especially serious consequences. After being banned from attending schools and universities, many turned to online education as their only means of continuing their studies.""My students had Wi-Fi, but now it no longer works,"" said Afghan filmmaker Sahraa Karimi, who teaches her students from abroad. ""I read in the news that the Taliban have shut down the internet in many cities. I'm heartbroken, how am I supposed to teach the girls now?""Activists inside Afghanistan are also voicing their concerns.""Shutting down the internet is the final step toward backwardness, ignorance, and destruction,"" one woman said in a video message to DW.Another called it ""a direct attack on the dignity, freedom, and future of a nation.""""When the Taliban cut off the internet, it's not just a technical issue,"" warned Pashtana Durrani, founder of the online school network LEARN Afghanistan. ""It's an attack on the country's future.""For many students, she said, the internet is their last link to teachers and lessons. Girls in particular, excluded from schools and universities, lose their only opportunity to continue learning.""Every blackout,"" Durrani added, ""sets Afghan youth further back, weakens the intellectual foundation of the country, and deepens the despair of the younger generation.""","Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada imposed a complete ban on the technology. Reports of severe disruption in other parts of the country, including the northern provinces of Kunduz, Badakhshan, Baghlan and Takhar. Traders and business owners warn of severe consequences if this access is also restricted.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124049189,imgsize-606436,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"
