SRINAGAR: J&K CM Omar Abdullah ruled out taking to the streets for restoration of statehood, saying Tuesday that young lives cannot be risked in a climate of trigger-ready forces. “In Ladakh, they opened fire within an hour. In Kashmir, they would not wait 10 minutes,” Omar said, vowing to press demand politically and peacefully. “We will get our rights while abiding by law and the Constitution, but I won’t allow people to be pushed into the flames and destroyed.”Omar reminded how Leh initially celebrated the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019 but later reversed course. “People of Kargil never accepted that decision. We didn’t accept it either. But see how the situation changed in Leh. Leh celebrated at the time. Now they are saying they realised that Article 370 protected them for 70 years.”Omar Abdullah’s remarks came against the backdrop of Ladakh unrest, where security forces fired on demonstrators on Sept 24, killing four and wounding more than 80.He also pushed back against suggestions that Kashmiris could shift to BJP if governance falters.Turning to his govt formation last year, Omar revealed he resisted pressure to include BJP in office.","J&K CM Omar Abdullah ruled out taking to the streets for restoration of statehood. “We will get our rights while abiding by law and the Constitution, but I won’t allow people to be pushed into the flames and destroyed,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124245181,imgsize-842852,width-400,resizemode-4/omar-abdullah-4.jpg"

26/11 attack: Chidambaram says foreign pressure blocked retaliation; BJP hits out,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/26/11-fallout-chidambaram-says-foreign-pressure-blocked-retaliation-bjp-hits-out/articleshow/124244271.cms,"BJP MP Ravi Shankar Prasad

NEW DELHI: BJP on Tuesday launched a major onslaught on Congress over former Union minister P Chidambaram ’s statement that foreign pressure restrained the Manmohan Singh govt from retaliating against Pakistan after the 26/11 terror attack on Mumbai, saying the country has “paid a heavy price” for sins committed by Congress.BJP’s Ravi Shankar Prasad said Chidambaram’s comments have raised a big question as to “how weak the govt headed by Singh was”. “P Chidamabram, home minister in the Manmohan Singh govt, has now admitted that after the 26/11 attacks, he favoured retaliatory action against Pakistan, but the external affairs department... did not agree, and Singh remained silent,” he said, seeking answers from Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi as to what compulsions prevented them from acting on the home minister’s suggestions. “It took around 16–17 years for Chidambaram to acknowledge that they failed to give a decisive response to Pakistan for the 26/11 attacks. Why was this wisdom kept hidden for so long? It took years to arrive at this realisation; it’s shameful. The foreign ministry and other ministries overruled the matter, and Singh just watched as the country suffered. Hundreds were killed; the attacks were clearly linked to Pakistan-based terrorists.”Contrasting Congress’s response with the surgical strikes, air strikes and Operation Sindoor conducted by India under PM Modi, Prasad asked, “Who was running the country then? Where was Sonia Gandhi?”In a TV interview, Chidambaram said India had considered military retaliation after the 26/11 attacks but chose not to do so, apparently under pressure from other countries. “The whole world was descending upon Delhi to tell us don’t start a war... For example, Condoleezza Rice, who was then (US) secretary of state, flew in two or three days after I took over to meet me and the PM and to say, please don't react. I said this is a decision which the govt will take. ”“Without disclosing any official secret, it did cross my mind that we should do some act of retribution.” he added. Chidambaram said the PM had discussed this even when the attack was going on ... and “the conclusion was largely influenced by the MEA and IFS (Indian Foreign Service) that the Indian govt should not physically react to the situation”.BJP MP Sudhanshu Trivedi said that instead of taking action against Pakistan after 26/11 attack, UPA govt just seven months later agreed to address Pakistan’s unsubstantiated accusation about India stoking trouble in Balochistan.","Former Union minister P Chidambaram said foreign pressure restrained the Manmohan Singh govt from retaliating against Pakistan after the 26/11 terror attack on Mumbai.

Was in Mumbai During 26/11, Worked with ISI and Lashkar e Taiba: Tahawwur Rana's Shocking Confession

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party launched a sharp attack on former Union home minister P Chidambaram over his recent remarks on the UPA government's decision not to retaliate militarily against Pakistan following the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks, accusing the Congress of “mishandling” the situation under foreign pressure.Reacting to Chidambaram’s statements made during an interview, union minister Pralhad Joshi posted on X, “After 17 years, Chidambaram, former home minister, admits what the nation knew - 26/11 was mishandled due to pressure from foreign powers. Too little, too late.”In the interview, Chidambaram said that the idea of retaliation “did cross [his] mind”, but the government eventually decided against military action. He said this decision was influenced largely by the ministry of external affairs and senior diplomats.“The whole world descended upon Delhi to tell us 'don't start a war'. Condoleezza Rice, who was then US secretary of state, flew in two or three days after I took over… to say, 'please don't react',” he said.Also read: PM Modi's 'Operation Sindoor' post: Congress takes '3rd umpire' jibe, says battlefield comparison not app

Chidambaram, who took over as home minister just days after the attack, also acknowledged that he discussed possible retributive steps with the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and other key figures.“The Prime Minister had discussed this even when the attack was going on... And the conclusion was, largely influenced by the ministry of external affairs and the IFS, that we should not physically react to the situation,” he recalled.The remarks have sparked a political row, with BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla questioning whether then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh or UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi had overruled Chidambaram’s personal view in favour of retaliation.Posting on X, he wrote, “Why was UPA taking orders from [Condoleezza Rice]? Why did Sonia Gandhi prevail over the Home Minister?” he asked.Poonawalla further accused the Congress of giving Pakistan a “clean chit” not only on the 26/11 attacks but also in the 2007 Samjhauta Express bombing case. He alleged that the UPA government advanced a “Hindu terror” narrative and granted Pakistan ‘most favoured nation’ (MFN) status despite repeated cross-border terror incidents.He added, “Congress gave clean chit to Pak on 26/11 and Samjhauta & induced Hindu Terror angles. Today too they doubt Surgical Strike, Balakote and Operation Sindoor.”On November 26, 2008, ten heavily armed Pakistani terrorists carried out coordinated attacks across Mumbai, killing over 166 people and injuring hundreds. One attacker, Ajmal Kasab, was captured alive and later executed in 2012.","Former Union home minister P Chidambaram said the idea of retaliation “did cross [his] mind”, but the government eventually decided against military action.

NEW DELHI: Incidents of extremist, insurgent and terrorist violence have recorded a sharp fall from 446 in 2022 to 163 in 2023. The decline spans across categories, with left-wing extremism, jihadi terrorism and North-East insurgency showing significant reductions.The steepest fall has been in jihadi terrorist activities, which dropped from 126 in 2022 to just 15 in 2023. Violence linked to North-East insurgents also came down to 10 cases, from 26 in 2022, according to the NCRB 2023 report.While the civilian casualties have decreased, the number of police and army personnel killed has risen. The report also noted a steep increase in arms and ammunition looted by the extremists.The report said that incidents of insurgency int he North-East reduced by over 61% compared to 2022, and Left-wing extremist violence dipped by over 44%. Jihadi terrorist activities saw the sharpest decline — over 87% — followed by “other terrorist” incidents, down by more than 77%. Registered cases too reflected this pattern, with a fall of more than 58%.The total casualties — civilians and security personnel — fell from 118 in 2022 to 103 in 2023.However, within this figure, deaths among police, state and army personnel rose by 50%. With fewer operations, extremist fatalities also dropped by more than 54%, from 131 to 60.Number of surrenders has also fallen, from 417 in 2022 to 318 in 2023, marking a 23% decline, according to the report. Of these, 316 were left-wing extremists. Among North-East insurgency-related crimes in 2023, 85% were categorised under “unlawful activities”.A major concern flagged in the NCRB report is the spike in looted weapons. In 2023, extremists seized 706 arms and 19,946 rounds of ammunition from police and central armed police forces. This is dramatically higher than 2022, when only 36 arms and 99 rounds were reported stolen.","Incidents of extremist, insurgent and terrorist violence have recorded a sharp fall from 446 in 2022 to 163 in 2023.

"How can we see him getting burned? This MP village recites ‘Ravan Chalisa’ on Dussehra, youth sport Jai Lankesh tattoos",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/this-mp-village-bears-ravans-name-chants-his-chalisa/articleshow/124244213.cms,"VIDHISHA: Every day, in a village 80km from Bhopal, the lines ‘Jai Lankesh gyan gun sagar, Asur raj sab lok ujagar’ reverberate across homes and fields. Unlike rest of the country, people here recite ‘ Ravan Chalisa’, perform aartis of Ravan as god, not demon.On Thursday, when effigies of Ravan will be burnt to celebrate Dussehra , this village, called Rawan, will host a grand feast and puja of Ravan, whom its people consider ‘gram devta’.While elders recite ‘Ravan Chalisa’, composed by locals and displayed on a temple wall which has a 12-foot reclining statue of Ravan, the young move around on tractors and motorcycles with ‘Jai Lankesh’ stickers on the vehicles and tattoos on their arms.The village is home to 372 families, mostly Kanyakubj Brahmins.Located in Nateran tehsil of MP’s Vidisha, the statue is believed to be 500 years old. Lore has it that a demon called Budeka lived on a nearby hill and was instructed by Ravan to build his statue. The temple’s intricate carvings are seen as a reflection of Ravan’s wisdom and divinity.“In any social or religious event, Ravan Baba is worshipped first. Every day, puja is performed at the temple, attended by elders and young ones.This tradition has been followed for centuries,” said 78-year-old Laxmi Narayan Tiwari, a local and a senior advocate.Residents and village youth have formed Lankeshwar Welfare Society to carry out development and beautification work at the temple.The rituals surrounding Ravan here are unique.Temple priest Arvind Tiwari cited long-held beliefs that inviting “Ravan Baba” to any occasion brought good fortune -- this is done by placing a cotton ball dipped in oil on the idol’s navel.Villagers said they had no idea when the village was called ‘Rawan’ but made it clear that they never wanted it changed as the name signified pride.Devotion to Ravan goes far beyond rituals. A village youth, Ankit Dhakad, has tattooed a picture of Ravan and his name on his hand. “All my friends have tattoos of Lankesh on their bodies. We feel pride in this because Ravan is our god,” he said.In the pond, there is a stone sword and nearly 7ft of the blade is visible when the water recedes in summer. Villagers claim it is “Chandrahas” -- believed to be Ravan’s sword. For generations, people have tried to dig deeper to discover its full length, but no one has succeeded. The sword remains submerged, worshipped as a symbol of Ravan’s power.As the village sees Ravan as a scholar and protector, it opposes the practice of burning his effigy.“I attend Durga Utsav but do not watch the burning of Ravan’s effigy. It brings a lot of pain to me. He is our god whom we have been worshipping for generations; how can we see him getting burned?” said Manish Tiwari (51), a farmer.","Villagers in Vidisha, Madhya Pradesh, worship Ravan as a god, not a demon.

Buildings, roads shaken in Bogo quake

'I was in shock and in panic'

'It could be worse than we think': Cebu Governor





At least 69 people died after a massive 6.9 magnitude earthquake hit the central Philippines province late Tuesday, damaging several houses and buildings, AFP reported citing rescuers.The intense shaking led to power outages, forcing residents to evacuate their homes into darkness, officials said.The earthquake's epicentre, caused by movement along a local fault at a depth of five kilometres, was located approximately 19 kilometres northeast of Bogo, a coastal city with a population of about 90,000 in Cebu province.At least 14 residents died in Bogo, disaster-mitigation officer Rex Ygot told The Associated Press by telephone.The death toll in Bogo is expected to rise as workers attempt to transport a backhoe to expedite search and rescue operations in a cluster of shanties in a mountain village affected by a landslide and boulders, he added.Glenn Ursal, another disaster-mitigation officer, told The Associated Press, “It’s hard to move in the area because there are hazards,” adding that some survivors were taken to a hospital.In Medellin town near Bogo, at least twelve residents, mostly from small families, died when they were struck by falling ceilings and walls of their houses, some while sleeping, Gemma Villamor, head of the town's disaster-mitigation office, told The Associated Press.In San Remigio town, also near Bogo, five people, including three coast guard personnel, a firefighter and a child, were killed separately by collapsing walls while attempting to flee to safety from a disrupted basketball game, the town’s vice mayor, Alfie Reynes, told the DZMM radio network.Reynes appealed for food and water, stating that San Remigio's water system was damaged by the earthquake.Besides houses in Bogo, the quake damaged a fire station and concrete and asphalt roads, firefighter Rey Cañete said.“We were in our barracks to retire for the day when the ground started to shake and we rushed out but stumbled to the ground because of the intense shaking,” Cañete told The Associated Press, adding that he and three other firemen sustained cuts and bruises. A concrete wall in their fire station collapsed, he said.He and fellow firefighters provided first aid to at least three residents who were injured by falling debris and collapsed walls. Hundreds of terrified residents gathered in the darkness in a grassy field near the fire station and refused to return home hours after the earthquake struck in Bogo.Several business establishments sustained visible damage, and the asphalt and concrete roads had deep cracks, Cañete added. An old Catholic church in Daanbantayan town near Bogo was also damaged.The belfry of a church in Bantayan town square collapsed, leading to the collapse of a commercial building and a school in Bantayan, Cebu, the provincial government reported.Additionally, a fast food restaurant in Bogo sustained heavy damage. Martham Pacilan, 25, told AFP he was at the Bantayan town square near the church when its belfry collapsed.""I heard a loud booming noise from the direction of the church then I saw rocks falling from the structure. Luckily no one got hurt,"" he said. ""I was in shock and in panic at the same time but my body couldn't move, I was just there waiting for the shake to stop.""Agnes Merza, a 65-year-old carer based in Bantayan, reported that her kitchen tiles had cracked.""It felt as though we would all fall down. It's the first time I have experienced it. The neighbours all ran out of their homes. My two teenage assistants hid under a table because that's what they were taught in the boy scouts,"" Merza added.Cebu Governor Pamela Baricuatro said that the extent of the damage and injuries in Bogo and surrounding towns in the northern section of the province would not be known until daytime. “It could be worse than we think,” he said in a video message posted on Facebook.The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology briefly issued a tsunami warning and advised people to stay away from the coastlines in Cebu and the nearby provinces of Leyte and Biliran due to possible waves of up to one metre. Teresito Bacolcol, director of the institute, said the tsunami warning was later lifted as no unusual waves were detected.Cebu and other provinces were still recovering from a storm that struck the central region on Friday, leaving at least 27 people dead, mostly due to drownings and falling trees. The storm knocked out power in entire cities and towns and forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of people.","At least 69 people have died after a massive 6.9 magnitude earthquake hit the central Philippines province late Tuesday.

Shutdown in almost seven years



Poll Should the Senate pass the House measure to extend federal funding? Yes, it's important No, they should negotiate further

Which side will blink first? No clarity yet







US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said that United States government is on the brink of a shutdown in almost seven years and blamed Democrats for the stalled talks with Republicans on a funding deal.""We'll probably have a shutdown,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office just hours before a midnight deadline for a deal. ""Nothing is inevitable, but I would say it's probably likely.""The US government will witness a shutdown in almost seven years, triggered by a partisan standoff over health care and spending. Democrats and Republicans in Congress are unable to find agreement; meanwhile, thousands of federal workers are at risk of being laid off.If the Senate does not pass a House measure, the government will shut down at 12.01 am on Wednesday. The House measure will help extend federal funding for seven weeks.However, Senate Democrats vowed to stand against it, saying that they would not vote for it unless Republicans include an extension of expiring health care benefits.Trump and his colleagues have maintained that they will not negotiate. They added that it is a stripped-down, “clean” bill that should be noncontroversial.""It's only the president who can do this. We know he runs the show here,"" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said.""Republicans have until midnight tonight to get serious with us,"" Schumer said.Meanwhile, Trump mocked Democrats by posting a video. ""They lost the election in a landslide, and they don't change,' Trump said Tuesday morning.The US government witnessed the last shutdown during Trump's first term from December 2018 to January 2019. It was triggered after he demanded that Congress give him money for his US-Mexico border wall.It was the longest shutdown ever, as he retreated after 35 days.","The US government will witness a shutdown in almost seven years, triggered by a partisan standoff over health care and spending.

Federal agents at a Manhattan immigration court clashed with journalists on Tuesday, injuring one and raising renewed concerns over the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement.Visual journalist L Vural Elibol of the Turkish news agency Anadolu was shoved to the floor outside an elevator at 26 Federal Plaza, striking his head.He was attended to by a bystander and a nurse before being taken away on a stretcher in a neck brace and transported to a hospital for evaluation, as per news agency AP.The other journalists involved—Dean Moses of amNewYork and freelance photographer Olga Fedorova—were not seriously hurt.The confrontation unfolded as federal agents, responding to an immigrant from Peru allegedly in the US without legal standing, were followed by journalists into an elevator on the 12th floor, reported The New York Times.Moses said agents “grabbed me by my arms, and started pulling me out of the elevator. I tried to hold on, but I got shoved out”.Video footage showed Fedorova falling backwards toward Elibol during the chaos, capturing the rapid escalation.The incident comes days after another federal agent was caught on video pushing a woman into a wall while her husband was being detained, triggering an investigation by Homeland Security.Both events took place in a public area frequented by immigrants, journalists, and activists documenting court proceedings.Homeland security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin defended the agents’ actions, citing safety concerns after prior threats and incidents, including a sniper attack on an ICE field office in Dallas last week.She said agents had repeatedly instructed journalists to move back, and described the crowd as “agitators” obstructing operations, as per AP.“Rioters and sanctuary politicians who encourage individuals to interfere with arrests are actively creating hostile environments that put officers, detainees and the public in harm’s way”, McLaughlin said.“Officers repeatedly told the crowd of agitators and journalists to get back, move, and get out of the elevator”, she added.Elected officials criticised the use of force. New York Gov Kathy Hochul called it “abuse of law-abiding immigrants and the reporters telling their stories”.Public Advocate Jumaane Williams and City Comptroller Brad Lander condemned the incident, urging the NYPD to intervene to prevent further violence.State Assemblyman and NYC mayoral candidate, Zohran Mamdani, said, “We cannot accept or normalise what has now become routine violence at 26 Federal Plaza”.Fedorova noted that journalists have routinely worked in the hallway without incident and that the agents did not announce their actions or restrictions before making arrests. “If they tell us to get out, to not cross a certain line, we follow their orders. In this case, it was not clear to anyone that this was a detention at all,” she said.","L Vural Elibol of the Turkish news agency Anadolu was shoved to the floor outside an elevator at 26 Federal Plaza.

Police Lathicharge Protesters After Violence Breaks Out In Bareilly During ‘I Love Muhammad’ March

What triggered Bareilly violence?





NEW DELHI: Congress MP Imran Masood was placed under house arrest in Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh, on Wednesday.He was preparing to lead a party delegation to violence-hit Bareilly, where tensions remain high over the ‘I Love Muhammad’ poster row.Masood was set to head a Congress delegation to meet the Bareilly DIG and assess the situation on the ground following Friday’s violence.However, citing security concerns and the prevailing law and order situation, local authorities prevented him from leaving Saharanpur and placed him under house arrest.The Congress delegation's visit comes in the wake of violent protests in Bareilly, which erupted after Friday prayers. More than 1,000 people gathered near Islamia Ground, waving religious banners and raising slogans, following a call by cleric Maulana Tauqeer Raza Khan. The protest was triggered by an FIR registered in Kanpur over a Barawafat poster bearing the message ""I Love Muhammad"".According to police, the protest turned violent when sections of the crowd began pelting stones, vandalising vehicles, and even firing in the air.The police responded with a lathi charge and tear gas, leading to a stampede-like situation. At least 10 police personnel were injured.In response, authorities detained around 50 individuals, including Maulana Tauqeer Raza Khan. FIRs have been registered at multiple police stations, and police teams are combing through video footage and phone records to identify additional suspects.Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath condemned the violence and ordered strict action. “Every miscreant should be identified and arrested,” he said, adding that video footage and social media posts should be used to track those involved. He also warned against rumour-mongering and attempts to incite caste or communal tensions, especially ahead of Dussehra.Religious leaders across communities have called for calm. Maulana Shahabuddin Razvi Bareilvi, president of the All India Muslim Jamaat, appealed to people not to take the law into their own hands. “The Prophet’s message is one of peace — let us honour that by maintaining harmony,” he said.Meanwhile, security remains tight in Bareilly and other sensitive parts of the state. Flag marches were conducted, and police presence has been ramped up at religious sites and public spaces. The administration is also monitoring posts on social media and has announced fresh curbs on public gatherings under Section 144.The party has yet to issue a formal response to Masood’s house arrest.","Congress MP Imran Masood placed under house arrest in Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh.

Pakistan’s top leadership may send troops to Gaza as part of a Muslim nations’ peacekeeping force under a comprehensive peace deal announced by US President Donald Trump.The decision was announced by Pakistan’s foreign minister Ishaq Dar on Tuesday.At a press conference in Islamabad, Dar was asked directly about Pakistan’s role in the initiative, which aims to end the bloodshed in Gaza. “The force [here] is a peacekeeping force. On the ground, there will be Palestinian law-enforcement agencies... there will be [separate] forces supporting them. Indonesia has offered 20,000 troops for that. I am sure Pakistan's leadership will also be making a decision on this,” he said.Dar explained that the idea was to set up an independent Palestinian government of technocrats overseen by an international body. He said Pakistan had asked for the arrangements to be documented at the UN Security Council.He shared that a preparatory meeting of leaders from eight Muslim countries with US President Trump was held in New York last week on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. “The objectives were to try for a ceasefire in Gaza, make arrangements for sending humanitarian aid, stop the forced displacement of Palestinians and make arrangements for the return of the displaced Gazans,” he said.Dar added that the plan also included Gaza’s reconstruction and halting Israel’s efforts to annex the West Bank. According to him, Trump proposed that his team work with the foreign ministers of the Muslim nations to create a “workable solution.”The foreign minister said Saudi Arabia had reached out to Pakistan with a draft joint statement on the plan, which was later revised after his input. He noted that the Palestinian Authority welcomed the statement.On Monday, Donald Trump unveiled a 20-point peace plan aimed at ending the Gaza war by demanding Hamas’s disarmament, the immediate release of all hostages within 72 hours, and a phased withdrawal of Israeli forces. Under the proposal, Hamas would be excluded from any future governance; militants willing to abandon arms would receive amnesty, while those wishing to leave Gaza would be allowed safe passage. The plan also involves a temporary technocratic Palestinian committee ruling Gaza under oversight by an international “Board of Peace” led by Trump and including Tony Blair, until the Palestinian Authority is reformed.The initiative calls for humanitarian aid to flow into Gaza without interference from either Israel or Hamas, managed by UN agencies and the Red Crescent, with reconstruction under a “New Gaza” framework. Trump gave Hamas three to four days to accept the plan or face what he called “a very sad end.”",Pakistan's top leadership may send troops to Gaza as part of a Muslim nations' peacekeeping force.

Direct hit! Houthi Missiles Hit Dutch Cargo Ship In Gulf Of Aden, Two Injured, Crew Rescued





Yemen’s Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for a missile strike on the Dutch-flagged cargo ship Minervagracht in the Gulf of Aden, marking one of their most serious assaults on shipping outside the Red Sea since November 2023.The attack occurred on Monday and involved a cruise missile, according to Houthi military spokesperson Brig Gen Yahya Saree, who said the strike targeted the vessel over alleged violations of “the entry ban to the ports of occupied Palestine” by the ship’s owners, Amsterdam-based Spliethoff, reported news agency AP.The rebels stated the operation was “in response to the crimes of genocide and starvation perpetrated by the Zionist enemy against our people in the Gaza Strip, and to affirm the continued ban on Israeli maritime traffic in the Red and Arabian Seas”, according to the Times of Israel.The strike injured two crew members and forced the evacuation of all 19 sailors, hailing from the Philippines, Russia, Sri Lanka, and Ukraine, after the ship caught fire and was left adrift, according to the European naval force operating in the region, Operation Aspides.The US Navy-overseen Joint Maritime Information Centre initially reported that the Minervagracht had no ties to Israel, though a follow-up note said the centre was “reviewing vessel affiliations for possible links to Israel”.The attack highlights the Houthis’ widening campaign against shipping, which has already targeted over 100 vessels and Israel in response to the ongoing war in Gaza.While some of their strikes have hit targets with tenuous or no direct links to Israel, the campaign has disrupted maritime traffic in the Red Sea—a corridor for roughly $1 trillion in goods annually prior to the war—and has killed at least eight mariners and sunk four ships over the past two years.Monday’s assault indicates the group’s expanding operational reach in the Gulf of Aden, far from their usual Red Sea strikes, and comes amid heightened tensions in the Middle East following renewed Israeli ground operations in Gaza and UN sanctions on Iran.","Yemen’s Houthi rebels claim responsibility for a missile strike on the Dutch- flagged cargo ship Minervagracht in the Gulf of Aden.

US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that even after ending seven global conflicts, if he still hadn't received the Nobel Prize, it would be an insult to the country.Addressing the dozens of top generals and admirals in Quantico, Va, Trump said that despite solving global conflicts, the Nobel Prize will be given to some guy that didn’t do a damn thing but not him.“Nobody’s ever done that. Will you get the Nobel Prize? Absolutely not.” “They’ll give it to some guy that didn’t do a damn thing. They’ll give it to the guy who wrote a book about the mind of Donald Trump and what it took to solve the wars,” he continued.“The Nobel Prize will go to a writer.” The president added, “No, but let’s see what happens, but it will be a big insult to our country. I will tell you that. I don’t want it. I want the country to get it. And it should get it because there’s never been anything like it.”The president expressed optimism that the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza would conclude with his 20-point peace plan, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu indicated support for on Monday. Success would mark the resolution of eight conflicts. “If this works out, we’ll have eight, eight in eight months. That’s pretty good,” Trump said.The president has been raking up global support in his push for a Nobel Peace Prize, but ending the war in Gaza and the war in Ukraine are major diplomatic tests for him.

FBI Probes Dark Motive Behind Michigan Church Massacre, Leavitt Hints at Anti-Mormon Hate





Investigators in Michigan are intensively examining the life and actions of a man who killed four people and injured eight others in a church attack over the weekend, as officials work to determine his motive behind the attack and know what drove him to commit the violence.Authorities continue to classify the incident as an ""act of targeted violence,"" with the motive remaining unclear, according to Reuben Coleman, acting special agent in charge of the FBI’s Detroit field office, according to the New York Times.The suspect, identified as 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford of Burton, Michigan, was killed in a gunfight with police shortly after the rampage. Sanford, a Marine Corps veteran who served from 2004 to 2008 and achieved the rank of sergeant, had attended high school locally.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was quoted as saying by Fox News that the FBI is exploring whether Sanford harboured religious animosity.“All they know right now is this was an individual who hated people of the Mormon faith, and they are trying to understand more about this, how premeditated it was, how much planning went into it, whether he left a note”, she said.Authorities are also examining Sanford’s property, mobile phone records and speaking with his family, who have cooperated with investigators.The attack occurred Sunday morning at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints meetinghouse in Grand Blanc Township, a community of about 8,000 near Flint.Sanford drove a pickup truck into the building, brandishing two American flags, opened fire on worshippers, and set the church ablaze. Two victims were killed by gunfire, and two more were found later in the charred remains of the building.Eight others, ranging in age from 6 to 78, were hospitalised for gunshot wounds or smoke inhalation, as per Reuters.Grand Blanc Police Chief William Renye confirmed that all worshippers had been accounted for and said authorities are still investigating how the fire began, noting Sanford had likely used an accelerant such as petrol, reported BBC.Officials have interviewed more than 100 people connected to the incident as part of the probe.A separate account from a local Burton City Council candidate, Kris Johns, said Sanford had described members of the church as ""the antichrist"" during a conversation a week before the attack.Google Maps images show a Trump campaign sign at Sanford’s residence, though officials have not linked this to his actions.The Michigan shooting marks the 324th mass shooting in the US in 2025, according to the Gun Violence Archive. It comes a month after a shooting at a Catholic church in Minneapolis and coincidentally involved another 40-year-old Iraq War Marine veteran in a separate North Carolina shooting.Officials, including Governor Gretchen Whitmer, are urging the public to avoid speculation. “While it might feel natural to want to know why this attack happened, speculating is unhelpful and it can be downright dangerous,” she said, as cited by BBC.The FBI has deployed crisis response teams, bomb technicians, and more than 100 agents to assist in the ongoing investigation.Church representatives emphasised the sanctity of places of worship and called for healing. “We pray for peace and healing for all involved,” said Doug Andersen, a spokesman for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.","Thomas Jacob Sanford, 40, killed in gunfight with police after shooting at Michigan church.

New York Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani on Sunday responded to Mayor Eric Adams’ shock decision to drop out of the race just over a month before Election Day, calling it a reflection of Adams’ ties to wealthy donors and national political figures rather than a shift in the city’s priorities.“It is very much the same race,” Mamdani told reporters. “It’s a race between us and the failed politics that we’ve seen, whether it’s Andrew Cuomo or Eric Adams… We’re going to show that they can’t dictate the outcome of this race”, he said, as per ABC 7 New York.Mamdani, who decisively defeated Cuomo in the Democratic primary, emphasised that his campaign remains focused on New Yorkers and the affordability crisis.“New Yorkers deserve leadership that is thinking about how to benefit the people of the city… too often politicians, be it Andrew Cuomo or Eric Adams, the meetings that they have or the phone calls with someone like Donald Trump , they’re only speaking about themselves”, he said, as quoted by democracynow.org.Criticising Adams’ record, Mamdani highlighted rising costs under the mayoralty. “This is a mayor who raised the rent by 12% on more than 2 million New Yorkers… and time and time again, exacerbated a cost-of-living crisis,” he claimed.Mamdani also addressed US President Donald Trump’s involvement and efforts to influence the race.“Donald Trump has spoken time and again about how he wants to narrow this race… yet we’re seeing the moment where he is shaping this race. But we’re going to show him that New Yorkers are tired of his politics and they’re tired of being priced out of the city”, he said, according to The Hill.He issued a pointed message to Cuomo, who has likely benefited from Adams’ exit. “To Andrew Cuomo. You got your wish. You wanted Trump and your billionaire friends to help you clear the field. But don’t forget, you wanted me as your opponent in the primary too, and we beat you by 13 points”.Despite Adams’ withdrawal, Mamdani insisted his campaign strategy remains unchanged. “We will have the same focus as we’ve always had, on working-class New Yorkers, their struggle to afford this city… and making sure the politics of the past do not dictate our future”.In polls, Mamdani currently leads the field with 45% support, ahead of Cuomo at 25%, Sliwa at 9%, and Adams at 8%.",New York Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani on Sunday responded to Mayor Eric Adams' shock decision to drop out of the race.

WH withdraws EJ Antoni nomination: Heritage economist pulled from BLS leadership; Trump to announce new nominee soon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/white-house-withdraws-ej-antoni-nomination-heritage-economist-pulled-from-bls-leadership-replacement-expected/articleshow/124247874.cms,"File photo: EJ Antoni with Donald Trump





The White House has withdrawn the nomination of EJ Antoni, a conservative economist at the Heritage Foundation, to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), a post that has been vacant since President Donald Trump fired the previous commissioner over a jobs report he deemed unfavorable.The Senate received paperwork formally withdrawing Antoni’s nomination on Tuesday, as per the news agency AP.A White House official praised Antoni as a “talented economist” but did not provide a reason for the withdrawal, only noting that President Trump plans to nominate a replacement soon.Antoni’s nomination had been controversial from the start, as he had no government experience and had been a vocal critic of the BLS, echoing Trump’s accusations that the agency’s data was biased.Economists across the political spectrum questioned Antoni’s suitability, citing his history of misreading recessions, import prices, and other indicators, as well as his partisan commentary.Kyle Pomerleau of the American Enterprise Institute called him “not one of the competent conservative economists” for the role, as cited by AP.Labor economist Aaron Sojourner welcomed the withdrawal, saying Antoni was “underqualified” and expressing hope that the next nominee would be a “champion for the agency and its mission”, as quoted by the New York Times.Additional scrutiny arose over Antoni’s personal history. Reports indicated he was present at the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack and that Nazi-era imagery appeared in his televised interviews.Financial disclosures show Antoni earned over $495,000 annually at the Heritage Foundation, plus additional income for speeches and consulting.Kevin Roberts, president of the Heritage Foundation, defended Antoni, calling him “one of the sharpest economic minds in the country” and stating he would remain as the organization’s chief economist rather than joining the government.The next BLS commissioner will take over at a challenging moment. The agency’s deputy commissioner, William Wiatrowski, currently serves in an acting capacity and will soon be the only employee on duty if a government shutdown occurs, as all other staff would be furloughed when federal funding lapses on Wednesday at 12:01 am.Independent advocacy group Friends of BLS, co-chaired by former bureau leaders Erica Groshen and Bill Beach, urged that the new nominee demonstrate “a commitment to gold standard statistics, strong management skills, excellent economics training and a record of public support for the integrity of BLS products and standards”, as per news agency AFP.Antoni’s withdrawal comes amid heightened scrutiny of Trump’s handling of economic data. He had fired Erika McEntarfer, the previous commissioner, shortly after the July jobs report showed slower-than-expected hiring, which Trump claimed was politically manipulated—a move economists warned could undermine trust in federal data.","The White House has withdrawn the nomination of EJ Antoni, a conservative economist at the Heritage Foundation, to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Shutdown showdown: Federal agencies send emails blaming Democrats; cite 'unrelated policy demands',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/shutdown-showdown-federal-agencies-send-emails-blaming-democrats-cite-unrelated-policy-demands/articleshow/124245772.cms,"File photo (Picture credit: AP)





Federal agencies under US President Donald Trump have sent emails to employees blaming congressional Democrats for a potential government shutdown, raising concerns among ethics experts about the partisan nature of the communications.Emails, sent Tuesday by at least four agencies, including the departments of interior, homeland security, and health and human services, stated that Trump “opposes a government shutdown and strongly supports enactment of H.R. 5371,” the continuing resolution intended to fund the government through November 22.They added, “Unfortunately, Democrats are blocking a clean continuing resolution in the US Senate due to unrelated policy demands”, as per The Hill.HHS spokesman Andrew Nixon said the message was necessary, calling Democrats’ stance “holding the government hostage” and warning it would impact care to millions of Americans.The department of housing and urban development also posted a banner on its website accusing “The Radical Left” of planning to “shut down the government and inflict massive pain on the American people” unless their $1.5 trillion policy demands were met.Ethics experts described the communications as highly unusual but not explicitly illegal.Donald Sherman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington was quoted by The Hill as saying that the emails were “highly inappropriate, highly irregular, but not illegal,” noting they skirt laws like the Hatch Act and the Anti-Lobbying Act by avoiding explicit electioneering or urging calls to Congress.Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer criticised the messaging, arguing that Republicans are responsible for the shutdown, saying, “Their bill has not one iota of Democratic input. That is never how we’ve done this before. It’s up to the Republicans whether they want a shutdown or not”.The shutdown vote escalated after Senate Democrats rejected a Republican funding bill 55-45, falling short of the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster.Schumer said Republicans are trying to “bully” Democrats over healthcare and other priorities.Federal agencies have also been told to prepare for operational disruptions.The Office of Management and Budget warned departments to consider permanent staff reductions in areas “not consistent with the President’s priorities”, a more aggressive step than typical shutdown furloughs, as per news agency AP.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates about 750,000 federal employees could be furloughed daily if the shutdown begins after the September 30 deadline.House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries and other Democrats have argued that the government funding bill should include healthcare protections, including extending Affordable Care Act subsidies and reversing recent Medicaid cuts, amid warnings that millions of Americans could face higher premiums if the GOP refuses to negotiate.Trump’s approach has included pointed partisan messaging alongside stalled negotiations. Hours after a White House meeting with congressional leaders, he posted an AI-altered video mocking Schumer and Jeffries, which Schumer called “trolling like a 10-year-old” and Jeffries condemned as “racist and fake”.The standoff marks a critical moment, with both sides digging in, federal workers facing uncertainty, and the first shutdown in nearly seven years looming over Washington.","Federal agencies under US President Donald Trump have sent emails to employees blaming congressional Democrats for a potential government shutdown.Ethics experts described the communications as highly unusual but not explicitly illegal.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on Tuesday accused President Donald Trump of being ""racist"" over a deepfake video posted to the social media platform, which depicted him wearing a sombrero.The fabricated video was posted on Trump’s Truth Social account on Monday night and featured Jeffries sporting an exaggerated handlebar moustache with mariachi music playing in the background.The video, released hours after Trump met with congressional leaders about the looming government shutdown, appeared aimed at mocking Democrats’ stance on federal benefits for migrants — a claim Democrats deny.Speaking on the steps of the Capitol, where numerous Democrats rallied for Republicans to negotiate a bipartisan spending bill, Jeffries stated, “Mr. President, the next time you have something to say about me, don’t cop out through a racist and fake AI video.”He added, “When I’m back in the Oval Office, say it to my face. Say it to my face.”Trump, known for attacking minorities and exacerbating racial tensions to energise his MAGA base, has a longstanding record that Jeffries, the first Black lawmaker to lead either party, has consistently opposed.Uploaded hours after Trump met with congressional leaders regarding the shutdown, the video parodied a press conference held by Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York outside the White House following that meeting. The fake audio portrayed Schumer attacking his own party as being deeply unpopular “because of all of our woke, trans bulls—.” It further asserted, “Not even Black people want to vote for us anymore. ”","The fabricated video was posted on Trump’s Truth Social account on Monday night.

Government shutdown: From banks to courts- What stays open and what closes if Senate fails to pass funding bills,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/shutdown-showdown-from-banks-to-courts-what-stays-open-and-what-closes-if-government-funding-lapses/articleshow/124245308.cms,"'Democrat Policies Killing People': Ted Cruz Torches Cory Booker, Padilla At Stormy Senate Hearing

Why and when government would shutdown



What stays open



The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the nation's largest food aid programme, and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, known as WIC, would continue operations during a shutdown as funds allow, according to a shutdown planning document published by the US Department of Agriculture.

The US Postal Service would be unaffected because it does not depend on Congress for funding, USPS said in a statement. Post offices will be open.

The IRS would be fully staffed for five days, according to agency shutdown plans published Monday. The strategy does not say what the IRS, which lost about a quarter of its staff this year and now employs about 75,000 people, would do if the shutdown lasts longer than five business days.

More than 13,000 air traffic controllers would continue working, but without pay until the shutdown ends, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Most TSA employees would continue working, according to an agency statement

Last week, the federal judiciary warned that the courts could run out of money to fully sustain operations as soon as Friday if Congress fails to pass a spending bill. That is a shift. The courts sustained operations for five weeks when the govt shut down during Trump's first term.

The Social Security Administration would keep issuing retirement and disability benefits, but would furlough 12% of its staff and pause marketing campaigns, according to the agency’s shutdown plan. Payments would likewise continue under the Medicare and Medicaid healthcare programmes.

Banks

Federal law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, DEA and prison staff, will remain operational during a govt shutdown, officials confirmed. The Secret Service and Coast Guard will also continue their duties.

In the military, all active-duty personnel will stay on the job. However, nearly half of the Department of War's 741,477 civilian employees could face furloughs.

Services that may close during a govt shutdown



National parks, although the NPS had not officially released a shutdown contingency plan by Tuesday afternoon, Sept. 30.

Visitor centres and tours of federal govt buildings, including the US Capitol, White House and FBI Building, could be halted.

Smithsonian museums may close in the event of an extended shutdown.





The US is staring down a partial government shutdown as the clock ticks toward Tuesday’s midnight deadline, with President Donald Trump and Congress still deadlocked over a spending bill.If no deal is struck, hundreds of thousands of federal employees deemed nonessential will be furloughed — and this time, Trump is warning he may go even further, threatening permanent layoffs. What cuts could follow remain unclear.The chamber rejected a Democratic proposal and then shot down a Republican House-passed stopgap measure that would have funded the government through November 21. With both parties trading blame and refusing to back down, Washington remains with no clear path out of a shutdown.As of Tuesday afternoon, at least 21 of the 23 largest federal agencies posted details about which employees they would furlough.Congress writes detailed spending legislation for most U.S. govt agencies each year but rarely completes it before the fiscal year starts on October 1. Lawmakers typically pass stopgap spending bills to avoid disruption for several weeks or months while they finalize their work. The current stopgap bill is set to expire on September 30. Republicans and Democrats appear unlikely to reach an agreement on an extension that President Trump would sign into law before midnight on Tuesday. This situation could result in wide swaths of the govt lacking funds to continue their operations.Here is a guide to what would stay open and what would close in a govt shutdown, according to plans released so far:","US is staring down a partial government shutdown as the clock ticks toward Tuesday’s midnight deadline.

Trump administration vs Harvard





US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said that his administration had struck a deal with Harvard University after what he described as months of negotiations.“I guess we reached a deal with Harvard today, so we’ll see how that, all you have to do is paper it right, Linda,” Trump said, addressing education secretary Linda McMahon during an unrelated executive orders signing ceremony in the Oval Office.Outlining the agreement, Trump said Harvard would pay about $500 million and begin operating trade schools focused on emerging skills. “They’ll be paying about $500 million and they’ll be operating trade schools. They’re going to be teaching people how to do, AI, and lots of other things,” he added.However, the exact terms of the deal remain unclear. Neither the White House nor Harvard University immediately released further details of the arrangement or clarified what the trade school programs would entail.Earlier this month, a federal judge ruled in Harvard’s favour, restoring over $2 billion in federal research funding that had been frozen by the White House, delivering a significant victory for the university. Harvard became the first university to directly challenge the Trump administration in court.The standoff between the Trump administration and Harvard University has escalated since May, when the Health and Human Services (HHS) department froze or cut off significant research funding.In late August, a federal judge ordered $2.7 billion in grants reinstated, ruling that the government had overstepped its authority.The administration’s move to refer Harvard to the debarment process could bypass that court order by blocking the university from accessing new federal funds entirely. Such a step would also disrupt ongoing research in science, medicine, and defence.HHS had sent its investigation to the Department of Justice in July, opening the door for potential legal action. Harvard has denied the allegations, with officials claiming that the government is using accusations of antisemitism as a pretext to tighten federal control over the university’s internal affairs.",US President Donald Trump said his administration had struck a deal with Harvard University after what he described as months of negotiations.

Des Moines Public Schools Superintendent Ian Roberts has resigned after being arrested by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) over alleged immigration violations. The development comes as the US Department of Justice (DOJ) has also opened an investigation into the school district’s hiring practices.Roberts’s attorneys announced his resignation on Tuesday, calling the matter a “very complex case.” The 49-year-old, a citizen of Guyana who came to the United States in 1999, was taken into custody last week. According to ICE, Roberts had allegedly violated a removal order issued by a judge in May 2024.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) further disclosed that Roberts had a previous weapons charge from 2020. At the time of his arrest, he allegedly tried to evade authorities and was found with a loaded handgun, a knife and $3,000 in cash in his car.Initially, the Des Moines school district suspended Roberts with pay but converted it to without pay on Monday after the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners revoked his superintendent license. The district has maintained that background checks suggested Roberts was a US citizen.In his resignation letter, Roberts wrote, “Out of concern for his 30,000 students, Dr. Roberts does not want to distract the Board, educators, and staff from focusing on educating DMPS’s students.” His lawyers indicated they would seek to reopen his immigration case but declined to share further details.Meanwhile, the DOJ confirmed that it has launched a civil rights investigation into Des Moines Public Schools. Officials pointed to concerns about race-based hiring practices and specific quotas for teachers of color mentioned on the district’s website.","Des Moines Public Schools Superintendent Ian Roberts has resigned after being arrested by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The family of Christian Black, a 25-year-old man from Zanesville who died after suffering injuries while in police custody, announced Tuesday that they have reached a $7 million settlement with Montgomery County.Black had been jailed after crashing an allegedly stolen car and attempting to flee. Black’s death in March this year was ruled a homicide by the county coroner.While the settlement resolves the civil lawsuit, the family is pressing officials to ensure steps are taken to prevent similar deaths in the future. In addition to the settlement with Montgomery County, Black’s family has filed a separate lawsuit against NaphCare, the jail’s healthcare provider, alleging medical negligence and wrongful death, among other claims, according to CNN.Michael Wright, the family’s lawyer, said Montgomery County has accepted responsibility and indicated plans to expand inpatient mental health facilities. However, Wright stressed that the family seeks further accountability. “We want to see more, such as jail officers charged and convicted in their son’s death,” he told reporters at a news conference.Black’s mother, Misty Black, said the settlement does not mark the end of her pursuit of justice.“This check doesn’t stop the criminal side,” she said. “It’s not going to make me go away. I’m here. Justice for Christian Black. I won’t stop until justice is served.”Video footage released by the family and their attorneys showed Black inside a cell, yelling and repeatedly hitting his fist and head against a glass door. The Montgomery County coroner ruled his death a homicide, likely caused by positional asphyxia, which occurs when the chest cannot expand properly, depriving the body of oxygen.No jail personnel have been criminally charged in connection with Black’s death.","Christian Black, 25, died after suffering injuries while in police custody.

On Cam: 'Surprised' Lavrov Sows ‘TRUST ISSUES’ Doubt As Trump Mulls Tomahawk Missiles For Kyiv





A federal judge on Tuesday ruled that the Trump administration’s efforts to deport noncitizens who protested the war in Gaza violated the US Constitution.US district judge William Young in Boston sided with several university associations, calling the policy an ideological deportation that infringes on First Amendment rights.“This case perhaps the most important ever to fall within the jurisdiction of this district court squarely presents the issue whether non-citizens lawfully present here in United States actually have the same free speech rights as the rest of us. The Court answers this Constitutional question unequivocally ‘yes, they do,’” Young, a nominee of Republican President Ronald Reagan, wrote.The ruling followed a trial in which lawyers for the associations presented witnesses who testified that the Trump administration had coordinated efforts to target students and scholars critical of Israel or sympathetic to Palestinians.“Not since the McCarthy era have immigrants been the target of such intense repression for lawful political speech,” Ramya Krishnan, senior staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute, told the court. “The policy creates a cloud of fear over university communities, and it is at war with the First Amendment.”Lawyers representing the Trump administration argued there was no ideological deportation policy.“There is no policy to revoke visas on the basis of protected speech,” Victoria Santora told the court. “The evidence presented at this trial will show that plaintiffs are challenging nothing more than government enforcement of immigration laws, reported AP.John Armstrong, senior official at the Bureau of Consular Affairs, testified that visa revocations were based on longstanding immigration law. He acknowledged his involvement in revoking visas of several high-profile activists, including Rumeysa Ozturk and Mahmoud Khalil, and was shown memos endorsing their removal. Armstrong insisted that revocations were not based on protected speech and denied accusations of targeting individuals for their ideology.","US district judge William Young in Boston sided with several university associations, calling the policy an ideological deportation that infringes on First Amendment rights. “Not since the McCarthy era have immigrants been the target of such intense repression for lawful political speech,” Ramya Krishnan, senior staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124243179,imgsize-859660,width-400,resizemode-4/us-judge-slams-trump-on-deportations-cites-1st-amendment.jpg"

Why is Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst significant?







A lockdown at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst (JBMDL) in Burlington County, New Jersey, was lifted around noon on Tuesday after a hoax shooter threat.A lockdown was imposed just before 11 am ET, which lasted approximately one hour following a report of an active shooter at the major US military installation. However, authorities later determined there was no active shooter threat.Base officials an hour later confirmed in a Facebook post stating, “ALL CLEAR. All personnel are to resume normal operations.” The lockdown had been ordered just before 11 am, with an earlier advisory urging personnel outdoors to take cover.“Our priority is the safety and security of everyone on the installation,” Col. Michael Stefanovic, JBMDL commander, said in a statement. “We worked closely with local law enforcement and emergency responders to ensure the situation was investigated and resolved as quickly as possible.”Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, located in central New Jersey, is a key tri-service US military installation, formed in 2009 through the merger of McGuire Air Force Base, Fort Dix, and Naval Air Engineering Station Lakehurst. Spanning over 42,000 acres across Burlington and Ocean counties, the base supports air mobility, training, and engineering operations critical to national defense.The installation is home to more than 40 units and mission partners, including the Air Force’s 305th Air Mobility Wing, Army Reserve and Guard units, and Navy test and evaluation programs. Its strategic location allows for rapid global deployment of personnel and equipment, while also serving as a central training hub for service members."," lockdown at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst lifted after hoax shooter threat. lockdown was imposed just before 11 am ET, which lasted approximately one hour.

Amid Trump-Sharif Meeting, Political Expert Explains Why US is Eyeing Pakistan As Military Launchpad





: In an effort to worm its way back into Washington’s good books, Pakistan ’s hybrid military-civilian leadership flashed glimpses of its purported rare earths bearing mineral wealth during a meeting with US President Donald Trump last week, going by a photo released by the White House.Among a dozen photos featured in the White House picture gallery relating to the Shahbaz Sharif- Asim Munir meeting with Trump is one where the duo is showing Trump an open 18x18 inch wooden box with colorful stones presumably bearing some mineral deposits. Two of the larger rocks appear to be bastanzite and monazite clumps that typically bear rare earths elements (REE) such as cerium, lanthanum, and neodymium. Some of the smaller candy-colored pebbles look like gemstones.Pakistan has long spoken of its vast untapped oil, gas, and mineral ores, some bearing rare earths, mostly in the troubled Balochistan region wracked with insurgency, and also in Khyber-Pakhtoonwa. While none of the mineral deposits are commercially proven or quantified, Pakistan’s leadership showcased the baubles to the US President to highlight collaboration and exploration bids it has signed with a private US firm earlier this month.The charm offensive also included PM Sharif wearing a lapel pin the had both the US and Pakistani flags, a gesture some Pakistani trolls on social media termed as “embarrassing.”While there is no direct government-to-government agreement to explore or exploit the mineral wealth, Pakistan's Frontier Works Organization (FWO)—a military-linked engineering and mining entity—signed an MoU on September 8 with the Missouri-based US Strategic Metals (USSM), a private US firm specializing in critical minerals.The agreement, with an initial funding of $ 500 million from USSM, envisages three phases: Phase 1 (Immediate, 2025–2026) involving export of readily available minerals (e.g., antimony and copper concentrates) to US markets, generating quick revenue. Phase 2 (Medium-term, 2026–2028) involving construction of processing plants and refineries in Pakistan, with technology transfer for REE separation and purification. Phase 3 (Long-term, 2028+), involving large-scale exploration and exploitation, including drilling in high-potential REE belts; and developing 5–10 mining projects.Islamabad's rare earths gambit with the US — which could cause Pakistan's patron China to burst a blood vessel since it has a stranglehold on rare earths supply to the US — comes on the heels of the its crypto caper, where it used a British-Pakistani entrepreneur to position itself as crypto capital where American businesses with ties to the Trump family could make a fortune.","Pakistan has long spoken of its vast untapped oil, gas, and mineral ores, some bearing rare earths.

NEW YORK: Despite being among one of the world's worst performers when it comes to democracy, and registering a high number of human rights violation cases, Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif defended the country's 'hybrid model' of governance where the army and civilian leadership work hand in glove in running the country.He made the remarks in an interview to British-American journalist Mehdi Hasan while defending Pakistan. Asif called the US democracy a ""deep state"" and tried to brush away the charges of military might in Pak governance.When asked by Hasan, ""It's a strange system you have in Pakistan. I think you've called it a hybrid model - where the military and civilian leaders effectively share power. But the military leaders are really the ones in charge, are they not? In most countries, the head of the army answers to the defence minister. In your country you, the defence minister, answer to the head of the army, don't you? Asim Munir is a more powerful person than you are. "" Khawaja Asif rejected the statements. and said: ""No, it's not like that... I'm a political appointee.""When confronted with the example of how in the US, Pete Hegseth, the secretary of war, has the power to fire American generals, but the same cannot be said for Pakistan, Asif sourly retorted, saying, ""They (US) have a different model over here.It's called deep state.""On Hasan further saying, ""In your country (Pakistan) the deep state's in charge. That's what the accusation is"", Asif put the blame on past leadership, stating, ""You can say that because of our military rulers - it is more visible...""On being further probed as to where the power lies in Pakistan, the defence minister explained it as ""hybrid"".Earlier this year, Asif had told Arab News about the 'hybrid regime' that currently runs the country, Dawn reported. The term, Dawn said, is used to describe the informal power-sharing arrangement, whereby the military holds a significant influence on the civilian leadership. ani","Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif defended the country's 'hybrid model' of governance.

Seventeen militants linked to the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) on Saturday were killed in a joint operation by Pakistan’s Frontier Corps (FC) and police in the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, officials told news agency AP.According to District Police Officer (DPO) Karak Shahbaz Elahi, the intelligence-led operation took place in the Karak district on Friday following credible reports about the presence of militants affiliated with the TTP and the Mullah Nazir group.As security forces approached, the militants opened fire, prompting retaliation in which all 17 were killed. A substantial cache of arms and ammunition was recovered from the scene. Three security personnel sustained injuries in the firefight.The slain militants were reportedly wanted for multiple crimes, including attacks on security forces, kidnapping for ransom, and other terrorist activities. A curfew was later imposed in Darsha Khel and surrounding villages to facilitate a wider combing operation, as several militants were believed to have fled the area.Separately, at least 23 civilians, including women and children, were reportedly killed in an airstrike in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Monday.","Seventeen militants linked to the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) were killed in a joint operation by Pakistan’s Frontier Corps (FC) and police in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Awkward contradictions on Imran Khan







Pakistan's defence minister, Khawaja Asif , has once again defended his country's ""hybrid model"" of governance, insisting that the military and civilian leadership work ""by consensus"" in managing state affairs.Speaking to British-American journalist Mehdi Hasan, Asif dismissed suggestions that the army dominates Pakistan's politics, while controversially describing US democracy as a ""deep state.""When asked whether Pakistan's generals hold more power than elected ministers, Asif retorted, ""No, it's not like that. I'm a political appointee, I’m a political worker."" Pressed further with comparisons to the United States, where civilian leaders have the authority to dismiss top generals, he claimed, ""They (the US) have a different model over here. It's called deep state.""Hasan pointed out that in Pakistan, critics accuse the military of being the real decision-maker. Asif acknowledged the perception, blaming ""past military rulers"" for the image, but insisted the system was based on consensus. Asked directly who prevails if he and Army chief Asim Munir disagree, Asif said: ""It's not equal. We can agree to disagree. It is by consensus, whatever is taking place.""Earlier this year, Asif had described the hybrid arrangement as a ""practical necessity,"" saying that while not an ideal form of democracy, it was helping Pakistan manage its economic and governance crises. Local daily Dawn has reported that Asif often praises the military-civilian partnership, despite critics branding it undemocratic.Turning to geopolitics, Asif insisted Pakistan's tilt toward Washington under US President Donald Trump, with new mineral and crypto trade deals, would not jeopardise Islamabad's ties with Beijing. ""We are not worried about that, because it's a time-tested relationship with China since the late 50s. China is not worried about our flirtations or whatever you call it,"" he remarked.Highlighting defence ties, he said: ""In the past, even today and in the future also, China has been a very reliable ally. Our Air Force, submarines, planes — almost a major portion of our arms are from China, and our defence cooperation is increasing. It is much more robust than before, with China, the main reason is unreliability of other sources like the United States.""He underscored geography as another factor: ""They (China) are reliable and they are our neighbours. We share borders and we share the geography.""The interview also turned uncomfortable when Asif was confronted about his shifting claims on jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan's social media activity. At one point, he alleged Khan was operating his account from Adiala Jail. When reminded that he had earlier accused India of controlling Khan's account, Asif appeared flustered.""You just made two different allegations. Is it Imran in his prison cell or is it India?"" Hasan asked. Asif responded, ""Either he is operating from the cell or he should at least identify who is operating the jail cell.""Pressed further on evidence, Asif cited ""intelligence sources"" but refused to provide details, insisting: ""The evidence I cannot publicly disclose… but it is there.""","Pakistan's defence minister defends country's ""hybrid model"" of governance.

Indonesia: 65 students trapped as school building collapses; 1 dead,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/indonesia-65-students-trapped-as-school-building-collapses-1-dead/articleshow/124224122.cms,"Poll Do you believe building regulations should be stricter to prevent similar incidents? Yes No





At least one student was killed, dozens were injured, and 65 were feared buried in the debris after Al Khoziny Islamic boarding school building collapsed in Indonesia.Rescue workers, police, and soldiers, who had been digging through the night, pulled out eight weak and injured students more than eight hours after the collapse in Sidoarjo, East Java. Additional bodies were spotted, suggesting the death toll could rise, AP reported.Families of the students gathered at hospitals and near the collapsed building, anxiously awaiting news of their children. Relatives wailed as they watched rescuers pull a dusty, injured student from the buried prayer hall.A notice board at the command post established in the boarding school complex listed 65 students as missing as of Tuesday morning. They were mostly boys in Class 7 to Class 11, aged between twelve and seventeen.“Oh my God... my son is still buried, oh my God please help!” a mother cried hysterically upon seeing her child's name on the board, followed by the cries of other parents facing similar losses.“Please, sir, please find my child immediately,” pleaded a father, holding the hand of one of the rescue team members. Heavy slabs of concrete, rubble, and unstable parts of the building hampered search and rescue efforts, said Nanang Sigit, a search and rescue officer leading the operation.Heavy equipment was available but not being used due to concerns it could cause further collapse. “We have been running oxygen and water to those still trapped under the debris and keeping them alive while we work hard to get them out,” Sigit said.He added that rescuers had seen several bodies under the rubble but were focused on saving those still alive. Several hundred rescuers participated in the effort, equipped with breathing apparatus, extrication tools, medical evacuation equipment, and other support devices.The students had been performing afternoon prayers in a building undergoing an unauthorised expansion when it suddenly collapsed on top of them, provincial police spokesperson Jules Abraham Abast said. Residents, teachers, and administrators assisted injured students, many with head injuries and broken bones.Female students were praying in another part of the building and managed to escape, survivors said. One male student, a thirteen-year-old boy, was killed, and ninety-nine other students were injured and taken to hospitals, some in critical condition, officials said. Authorities were investigating the cause of the collapse. Abast said the old prayer hall was two stories, but two additional floors were being added without a permit.“The old building's foundation was apparently unable to support two floors of concrete and collapsed during the pouring process,” Abast said.","Rescue workers, police, and soldiers pulled out eight weak and injured students more than eight hours after the collapse in Sidoarjo, East Java.
