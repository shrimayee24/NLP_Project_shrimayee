Portfolio reshuffle may happen before Aashada

NEW DELHI/BENGALURU: The much-anticipated meeting on Tuesday between the Congress high command, CM Siddaramaiah and DCM DK Shivakumar to discuss alleged lapses that led to the stampede outside cricket stadium resulted in putting up a united front with the party leadership backing its govt. However, the main takeaway from the meeting was that a fresh caste enumeration would be taken up in the state.The meeting, attended by AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge, leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi, AICC general secretaries Randeep Singh Surjewala and KC Venugopal, saw the high command accepting the action taken by the govt in the aftermath of the tragedy.""The CM and PCC chief briefed the leadership about the incident and the action taken post incident. Certainly, we are concerned about every human life. Anyway, the govt has constituted a judicial inquiry to look into the entire incident.

""We do believe there may be a portfolio reshuffle with controversy-ridden ministers being asked to change their departments,"" said a legislator.The top among the portfolios that are likely to see a change, if any, would be the home department and excise department, both of whose ministers have been in the news for the wrong reasons.","The meeting was attended by AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge, leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi.

However, students and parents/guardians have raised serious concerns over errors in the question paper and delays in redressal of grievances, urging National Testing Agency (NTA) to respond quickly.The results are expected later this month. NEET-UG remains the gateway for over 20 lakh students aspiring to get into MBBS, BDS, and other UG medical courses.In Sikar and Gujarat, candidates received faulty booklets with jumbled page numbers. For example, students who received Paper Code 47 in Sikar found that pages of the question paper were not in order. In Gujarat, particularly in Jamnagar, candidates using Gujarati-medium Paper Code 48 faced the same issue.Due to incorrect sequence of pages in question paper - like question 7 being followed by question 15 - some candidates said they darkened the circle for the wrong question. Others said valuable time was lost trying to figure out the correct corresponding circles on the answer sheet.Following the exam, guardians submitted formal complaints to Gujarat govt and NTA, attaching scanned copies of the faulty booklets as proof. ""Students even raised the issue during the test but were told to solve the faulty paper,"" a parent wrote. A state official confirmed the receipt of such complaints.NTA has declined to comment on the Sikar case, stating the matter is sub judice.Examinees and coaching experts also flagged certain questions as being beyond the medical syllabus. One example doing the rounds is question 38 of Code 47, which involved solving a calculus-based derivative - a topic more suited to engineering entrance tests like JEE (M).An NTA official said: ""All questions were from the prescribed syllabus. The answer keys have been published and objections invited from candidates. These will be reviewed by a committee of subject experts"". However, this does not resolve the concern about misprinted or non-sequential pages, which is a layout issue rather than a content-related one.","In Sikar and Gujarat, candidates received faulty booklets with jumbled page numbers.

BENGALURU: City police arrested a 37-year-old man on charges of kissing two women in Pulakeshinagar in east Bengaluru on the night of June 6.The accused is S Madan, a resident of Banasawadi. Police produced him before a local court Tuesday afternoon, and the court handed him over to 14-day judicial custody. Madan lives with his parents and a younger sister.

""We were walking inside the park while my child was playing. Suddenly, a stranger appeared and blocked my way. His stares told me all was not well, and I sneaked behind a tree.

‘He mourned Raja like a brother’: Mother sobs as police say Sonam Raghuvanshi's lover Raj Kushwaha son planned honeymoon murder; here's what he said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/he-mourned-raja-like-a-brother-mother-sobs-as-police-say-sonam-raghuvanshis-lover-raj-kushwaha-son-planned-honeymoon-murder-heres-what-he-said/articleshow/121765425.cms,"



INDORE: ""No, not our boy..."" The family of Raj Kushwaha - the 21-year-old arrested for conspiring with Sonam Raghuvanshi and murdering her husband Raja on their honeymoon in Meghalaya - is struggling to believe he is capable of such a heinous crime.""He can never do something like this,"" insists his mother Chunni Bai, 52, wiping her damp eyes with her pallu for the umpteenth time. ""Why, he cried for an hour after coming back from Raja's funeral, and said he'd have died if he had seen Raja's body,"" she told TOI on Tuesday.Police, however, say he planned Raja's murder with cold-blooded ruthlessness. And that he inserted himself into the grief of the two families when the couple was missing and at Raja's funeral where he was seen holding up Sonam's father.Raj worked in billing in Sonam's family business. Police say she and Raj had a relationship, which is why the two plotted to have Raja murdered by three of Raj's close friends. The Raj family can't believe any of this. For the last two days, they have stayed huddled inside their rented 200 sq ft room that is locked from outside. Every time a vehicle pulls up in front or a police siren is heard, Raj's 15-year-old sister faints, Chunni Bai says.Raj's sister Suhani, 18, told TOI: ""After the funeral, Raj was very tense about Sonam, worrying when she would be found. We were all anxious. Our younger sister even fasted praying for her well-being.""Little did they know that soon after Sonam was found, Raj would be in handcuffs, accused of a crime that has shocked the nation.On Sunday, following the funeral, Raj left and never returned. When the family called him, he said he was at (co-accused) Vishal's house. And this his phone was switched off. Police would arrest him at Vishal's home.The family insists they barely knew Sonam. ""We only met her once during a Garba when Raj took us. Many of his colleagues were present, including Sonam,"" said Suhani.Raj's family lives on the first floor of a modest two-storey house. The building, though old, is cared for, with a narrow staircase that creaks underfoot. The room is barely 10 ft by 20 ft, and it serves as the entire world for Raj, his mother, and his two sisters. A small slab in one corner is their kitchen, and a simple bed - Raj's bed - takes up most of the space. His sisters and mother sleep on the floor.Life had once been better for the family, when Raj's father Ramnazar owned a small fruit and vegetable shop. They had dreams of buying their own house, but then he had a brain tumour and died. His illness drained their resources, and they were forced to move into this small room, paying a monthly rent of Rs 3,500.Raj quit school in class 10 and found work in the local cloth market. ""People know him as a kind boy,"" his mother says. ""Once, he gave away his slippers to a barefoot vegetable vendor. Now, none of the neighbours talk to us. If someone stood by us, it'd be easier to bear this pain,"" said Suhani.The fact that his family doesn't believe he is capable of such violence only proves how cunning he is, say police. The circumstances, the evidence, Somam's calls to Raj from Meghalaya soon after his murder point at only one thing - that Raj has blood on his hands, investigators say.","Raj Kushwaha, 21, is accused of conspiring with Sonam Raghuvanshi and murdering her husband Raja on their honeymoon in Meghalaya.

The deployment followed days of protests sparked by aggressive federal immigration raids in the city.“Generations of Army heroes did not shed their blood on distant shores only to watch our country be destroyed by invasion and third-world lawlessness,” Trump told the gathered troops. “What you’re witnessing in California is a full-blown assault on peace, on public order and on national sovereignty, carried out by rioters bearing foreign flags,"" he added.He insisted the military presence was needed to protect federal property and staff amid what he described as escalating unrest. “My administration will liberate Los Angeles,” he said, framing the protests as a threat to national unity.Street demonstrations in Los Angeles began last Friday after federal agents were seen detaining immigrants in unmarked vans.Local officials have said that most protests have remained peaceful, limited to parts of downtown, though some clashes with sheriff's deputies have occurred.California’s Democratic-led government has responded sharply, filing a lawsuit to block Trump’s deployment order. State leaders have described the president’s actions as an abuse of power and a political provocation.Earlier in the day, Trump reiterated his hardline stance from the Oval Office, warning that any demonstrations during Saturday’s parade in Washington would be met with “very big force.” He did not distinguish between peaceful and violent demonstrators. However, both the FBI and the Metropolitan Police Department have stated there are no credible threats to the upcoming event.The Fort Bragg event also featured defence secretary Pete Hegseth and included military demonstrations such as a special forces assault and a long-range missile launch.","US President Donald Trump delivered a fiery speech at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, marking the 250th anniversary of the US Army.

"Thane accident: Trains move at slower speed on Mumbra stretch after mishap claim commuters, CR cites different reason",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thane/thane-accident-trains-move-at-slower-speed-on-mumbra-stretch-after-mishap-claim-commuters-cr-cites-different-reason/articleshow/121767751.cms,"



THANE: Local and mail express trains crossing the Diva end stretch of Mumbra platforms 3 and 4 were moving at a comparatively slower speed than before since Tuesday morning, commuters pointed out.Interestingly, this is a day after railway activists and regular commuters blamed the trains on the fast tracks cruising at high speeds at the sharp curvature at the northern end of Mumbra platforms 3 and 4 for possibly being the cause of the freak Monday mishap where four passengers died and ten others suffered injuries. An initial probe by the railway police had revealed the bags dangling out of the coaches of passengers travelling on the footboard may have brushed against each other, causing the mishap.Mumbra commuter activist Rafique Sheikh said trains were moving at a slower speed at the spot compared to the previous day. The Central Railways, however, claimed a speed restriction was imposed, but it was not due to the Monday incident. “There was some engineering work going on at a spot 1.5 km away from the spot,” said CR Chief PRO Swapnil Nila.Meanwhile, activists said they alerted the administration about three spots between Diva and Kalwa as potential danger spots.Diva-based activist Ananda Patil said he wrote to the railways three months back, highlighting how trains leaned dangerously to one side while crossing the stretches. “There are three spots between Diva and Kalwa which pose threats, but to date, there is no corrective action except for a statement by the administration declaring the spot to be as per the standards,” said Patil.Nila also dismissed the possibility and defended that the curvature was as per the norms. Meanwhile, the local staff from Mumbra station who attended to the mishap victims were likely to be called in for questioning. The railway police, guided by the Assistant Commissioner of Police, Railways, CSMT, also inspected the spot where the victims were found following the mishap to look for clues. “We are likely to access the CCTV footage of the spot along with the train pilot and manager of the CSMT and Karjat locals,” informed a police official requesting anonymity.","Locals and mail express trains crossing Diva end stretch of Mumbra platforms 3 and 4 were moving at a comparatively slower speed than before since Tuesday morning.

Maharashtra Pollution Control Board caught napping; revenue officials file FIR against 28 RMC plants!,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thane/maharashtra-pollution-control-board-caught-napping-revenue-officials-file-fir-against-28-rmc-plants/articleshow/121767478.cms,"Vasai revenue officials have filed an FIR against 28 RMC plant owners for environmental pollution and operating without permissions, highlighting the MPCB's slow response. The plants are accused of polluting water sources used by locals, prompting action after numerous complaints. This move raises questions about the MPCB's oversight and enforcement capabilities in the region.





VASAI: The Vasai revenue officials have filed an FIR against 28 ready mix cement (RMC) plant owners for polluting the environment, deteriorating the water quality and operating without any permissions at the Naigaon police station last week. It was the revenue officials who filed a complaint while the implementing and supervising body, the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) was found napping.The activists were upset that it was the revenue official who took the pain while it was the basic job of the MPCB. Apart from polluting the environment the RMC trucks are often seen driving on the wrong side, day and night, on the Mumbai Ahmedabad national highway (NH48) without any fear from the Mira Bhayandar Vasai Virar (MBVV) cops or the Highway police.The FIR filed on May 7 has been filed under the BNS sections 223 (disobedience to orders issued by public servants), 270 (public nuisance) and 279 (offences concerning the quality of public water sources). The FIR also mentions that these 28 RMC plants and Dambur Plants (Asphalt plants or Asphalt mixing plants) are the source of pollution for Air and Water.The FIR clearly mentions that the effluent generated by these RMC plants have been openly discharged in the water bodies further deteriorating the potable quality of streams and ponds, used on a daily basis by the locals and the villagers.Sushil Morale, Talathi (revenue official) said that on April 22 2025, we conducted survey of RMC and Dambur plants in two villages - Sasunavghar & Maljipada, in Vasai Taluka, after orders from our Tehsildar Avinash Koshti, as he had received several complaints about illegally operated RMC plants and pollution arising from them.He also said that these 28 units didnt produce any documents showcasing permissions from various government agencies who issue permissions to operate these units. We also gave them two weeks, but since they didnt turn-up with legal documents, we proceeded with the FIR. Now they will have to produce those documents to the cops post which their legality would be exposed.Deepak Rao, an activist in Vasai, who has filed PIL's regarding safeguarding the reclaimed waterbodies and escalating issues like illegal construction on forest land, said that, this was the job of the MPCB and not the revenue officials. What checks does the MPCB have in place while other government agency filed FIR against RMC's for polluting the environment, he questioned.We have acted on 20 RMC plants in MBMC and VVCMC jurisdiction in the last eight months and this is an ongoing activity, said Kiran Hasabnis, Regional Officer, MPCB, Thane. Filing FIR against 28 polluting units in one single day and taking action against 20 RMC units in eight months only speaks about the lackadaisical approach of the MPCB, added Deepak.In the first week of May, two natives from Uttar Pradesh had died after falling into a well, 30-feet deep, at a RMC unit located at Naigaon. The Naigaon cops had registered an accidental death report (ADR) in that case and have said that the investigation is still on.",Vasai revenue officials have filed an FIR against 28 ready mix cement (RMC) plant owners for polluting the environment.

Houston Rockets reportedly shut down New York Knicks’ approach for Ime Udoka







The New York Knicks' search for a new head coach has already hit roadblocks as multiple teams have shut down their efforts to interview top-tier candidates. After surprisingly parting ways with Tom Thibodeau following their Eastern Conference Finals loss to the Indiana Pacers, the Knicks began exploring replacements. But their list of desired names has been met with firm resistance, especially from the Houston Rockets, who reportedly rejected their formal request to speak with head coach Ime Udoka.As the New York Knicks move swiftly through their search for a new leader on the sidelines, they set their sights on Ime Udoka. But the Houston Rockets wasted no time in denying them access. According to SNY's Ian Begley, ""Knicks formally reached out to Rockets for permission to talk to head coach Ime Udoka and Rockets denied permission, per people familiar with Rockets’ stance.""Begley also confirmed a similar response from the Minnesota Timberwolves when New York tried to connect with their head coach. “@MikeFrancesa said Knicks reached out to Minnesota and were denied permission to talk to Chris Finch,” Begley added. The Athletic’s Kelly Iko previously noted that the Rockets had no interest in entertaining any Udoka-to-NY scenario.This isn’t the only coaching candidate the Knicks have eyed.Dallas Mavericks head coach Jason Kidd is also on their radar. While there’s been no formal request made yet, ESPN's Brian Windhorst said, ""There is mutual intrigue on both sides."" Kidd, who ended his playing career in New York and previously coached the Brooklyn Nets, could be an ideal fit.However, insiders believe Dallas will push back if an official request comes in. “Dallas... can simply refuse to grant the Knicks permission to speak with Kidd once formally asked,” wrote Marc Stein in his newsletter. James Edwards III echoed the sentiment in The Athletic, saying, “When that time comes, per multiple league sources, the expectation is that the Mavericks will deny that request.”Also Read: “Y’all gotta stop”: Kyrie Irving demands fans to stop humiliating Karl-Anthony Towns So far, the Knicks' top targets have either been unreachable or untouchable. With Houston and Minnesota standing firm, and Dallas unlikely to cooperate, the Knicks’ coaching search may be entering difficult territory.

Argentine Supreme Court upholds 6-year prison sentence for ex-President Fernandez,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/argentine-supreme-court-upholds-6-year-prison-sentence-for-ex-president-fernandez/articleshow/121767469.cms,"AP image





Argentina's highest court upheld a six-year prison sentence for former President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner in a ruling Tuesday that permanently banned her from public office over the corruption conviction that found she had directed state contracts to a friend while she was the first lady and president.The explosive Supreme Court ruling left Fernandez, Argentina's charismatic yet deeply divisive ex-leader, subject to arrest and sent her supporters pouring into the streets of Buenos Aires, Argentina's capital, and blocking major highways in protest.The court asked Argentina's security ministry to set up a detention centre to hold 72-year-old Fernandez. Her defense lawyer Carlos Beraldi told C5N, a television station in Buenos Aires, that he had requested Fernandez be allowed to serve her sentence in house arrest given her age.The ruling bars Fernandez from running in this fall's Buenos Aires legislative elections just days after she launched her campaign.Fernandez, who dominated Argentine politics for two decades and forged the country's main left-wing populist movement known as Kirchnerism, after her and her husband, former President Nestor Kirchner, rejects the charges as politically motivated.During Fernandez's eight years in office (2007-2015), Argentina expanded cash payments to the poor and pioneered major social assistance programs.But her governments funded the unbridled state spending by printing money, bringing Argentina notoriety for massive budget deficits and sky-high inflation.Critics blamed Argentina's years of economic volatility on Fernandez's policies, and outrage over successive economic crises and the country's bloated bureaucracy helped vault radical libertarian President Javier Milei to the presidency in late 2023.The ruling dealt a severe blow to Milei's opposition during a crucial midterm election year. He celebrated the ruling, writing on social media: ""Justice. Period.""Fernandez was embroiled in multiple corruption scandals during her tenure. She was convicted in 2022 in this corruption case, which centred on 51 public contracts for public works awarded to companies linked to Lazaro Baez, a convicted construction magnate and friend of the presidential couple, at prices 20% above the standard rate ally in a scheme that cost the state tens of millions of dollars.The high court rejected Fernandez's request for the court to review her prison sentence in March. In a resolution obtained by The Associated Press, the court said that the prison sentence ""does nothing more than to protect our republican and democratic system.""The Kirchner governments carried out ""an extraordinary fraudulent maneuver"" that harmed the interests of the government and resulted in the embezzlement of roughly $70 million at the current exchange rate, the resolution said.Supporters of Fernandez and her political movement blocked main roads into Buenos Aires and stormed the offices of Argentina's two main cable networks that are widely considered critical of the ex-leader, Channel 13 and Todos Noticias, smashing televisions, vandalising cars and shattering windows. There were no injuries reported.Fernandez rejected the decision, calling the court justices ""puppets"" of those wielding economic power in the country.""They're three puppets answering to those ruling far above them,"" she told supporters in a rousing speech outside her party's headquarters. ""It's not the opposition. It's the concentrated economic power of Argentina's government.""Gregorio Dalbon, one of Fernandez's lawyers, vowed ""to take this case to all international human rights organisations.""Fernandez has questioned the impartiality of the judges. She claims her defense didn't have access to much of the evidence and that it was gathered without regard to legal deadlines.Fernandez faces a series of other upcoming trials on corruption charges.","Argentina's highest court upheld a six-year prison sentence for former President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner.

VASAI: The Gupta family from Vasai has been relentlessly pursuing justice following the death of their 27-year-old son, Rupesh Gupta, who died on March 18, 2024, after being admitted to Breath Care Hospital with severe coughing. The family alleges medical negligence and is seeking the cancellation of the hospital’s registration.An FIR was registered in January 2025 at the Manikpur Police Station (Vasai West) against Dr Dharmendra Dubey of the Breath Care hospital under sections of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, following a report by the Palghar District Surgeon. The report confirmed lapses in medical care during Rupesh’s treatment. According to the Guptas, Rupesh was not treated by qualified specialists but by individuals with BAMS (Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery) backgrounds. The family claimed that Rupesh was not even given oxygen, and despite Dr Dubey never visiting the ICU, his consultation fee was charged.Rupesh’s father, Lalman Gupta, stated that this is not the first time Dr Dubey has faced legal action. ""There is already another FIR against him from a few years ago.With two serious cases on record, how is he still allowed to practice?"" he questioned. Adding to the family's frustration is the lack of clarity over who is responsible for acting against the hospital.While Dr Bhakti Chaudhary, Medical Health Officer (MHO, VVCMC) claims that only the District Surgeon of Palghar can initiate cancellation proceedings, the District Health Officer’s letter dated July 5, 2024, puts all responsibilities on the VVCMC, as its their jurisdiction. Moreover, the Gupta's have claimed that Dr Chaudhary herself is a charge-sheeted witness in a 2022 case (FIR: 0152/2022) involving the same hospital and Dr Dubey, raising questions about her impartiality and inaction.DrChaudhary stated that the hospital registration cannot be canceled until the ongoing court case is concluded. ""The FIR has been registered based on the civil surgeon's report.Action such as closure or deregistration will be taken only after the court verdict or a directive from the civil surgeon, as per the Bombay Nursing Homes Registration Act,"" she said. As the case continues to drag on in court, the Gupta family remains determined to seek justice and ensure that no other family suffers a similar fate due to alleged medical negligence and administrative apathy.Dr Dharmendra Dubey politely denied speaking on this issue.","Rupesh Gupta, 27, died on March 18, 2024, after being admitted to Breath Care Hospital with severe coughing.

The calm before the murder





NEW DELHI: As the sun dipped behind the misty hills of Meghalaya on May 23, Uma Raghuvanshi made a phone call she would dread for the rest of her life.Her newly-wed son Raja and his wife Sonam were on honeymoon in Shillong and Uma was simply concerned about their wellbeing.It was, a sacred fasting day and the devout mother-in-law had hoped Sonam might eat something while hiking. What she got instead was a gentle refusal — and a faintly breathless voice on the other end of the line.Sonam said softly.She mentioned they were trekking to a waterfall and sounded winded — as though she were climbing. When Uma asked to speak to Raja, Sonam said he was walking ahead and had left his phone in her bag.""That was the last time we ever tried to talk to her,"" Uma said, her voice shaking.""I could never have imagined that the daughter-in-law, speaking so gently, was actually scouting for a spot to kill my son — perhaps even moments away from doing it.""Cops are now trying to demystify the timing of that phone call — a conversation that may hold the key to understanding when and how, Raja Raghuvanshi was murdered.The couple had just visited the iconic double-decker bridge in Nongrait village and were hiking uphill when the call was placed. Sonam, calm and composed, told Uma she would not break her religious fast.Police are now trying to ascertain whether Raja was already dead during that call — or, more chillingly, being led to his death even as Sonam spoke sweetly to his mother.""That one call haunts us,"" said a senior officer. ""We now know from interrogations that the murder happened shortly after that phone conversation.""ACP Poonamchand Yadav of the crime branch confirmed that the timeline shared by the accused places the killing soon after that call.Investigators believe Sonam was carrying the only mobile phone with her. When Uma asked to speak to Raja, Sonam said, “Raja is walking ahead his phone is in the bag, I’ll get him to call you later.” She was panting, and Uma eventually disconnected the call.Police are now examining call duration, location data, and even the tone of her voice, in what they have described as a “cold-blooded calm before the kill.”","Uma Raghuvanshi was on her honeymoon with her son Raja in Meghalaya.

NEW DELHI: Residents of Pimpri’s Premlok Park area gathered in large numbers to worship a gulmohar tree that appeared to be emitting water, believing it to be a miracle. The crowd offered garlands, turmeric, and flowers, and some even tried to sip the “holy water” flowing out of the tree. However, the phenomenon was soon attributed to a burst underground water pipeline.A video of the incident, which occurred on the main road outside Sahara Society between 7 pm and 11 pm on June 6, has since gone viral and sparked conversations around the importance of education and the line between belief and superstition.Officials from the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) arrived on-site and conducted an inspection to determine the source of the water.“It’s not a miracle. An old water pipeline runs beneath the tree. Due to a leak, water found an outlet through the hollow trunk” said Pravin Dhumal, PCMC deputy engineer, as reported by Punekar News.Municipal staff promptly shut off the water supply and began repairs, ensuring that the tree was left undisturbed to avoid any environmental damage.The incident has drawn sharp criticism, with many highlighting the lack of awareness and scientific understanding that led to the tree being mistaken for a source of miraculous water.","Residents of Pimpri’s Premlok Park area gathered in large numbers to worship a gulmohar tree that appeared to be emitting water.

At least 36 people were killed and more than 200 wounded on Tuesday after gunmen opened fire on Palestinians while they were trying to access food aid in Gaza, bringing the total number of 163 civilians who lost their lives, according to the health ministry.A similar incident was reported in the southern city of Rafah, where at least eight people were killed while seeking aid. Meanwhile, in northern Gaza, two men and a child were killed, and around 130 others were injured local hospitals told, the Associated Press.Meanwhile, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the same day that there is “meaningful progress” in negotiations for a possible ceasefire and the release of some of the 55 remaining hostages in Gaza.Witnesses claimed Israeli drones and tanks opened fire around 2 am, as large crowds gathered hours before the scheduled start of aid distribution.Although the Israeli and US-backed Gaza humanitarian foundation insists that no violence has occurred directly at the distribution points, it paused operations last week to discuss safety concerns with the Israeli military. It has warned civilians to stay on designated routes.The Israeli military has admitted to firing warning shots in past incidents, claiming people approached their forces suspiciously.One resident, Abed Haniyah, said the shooting was ""indiscriminate"" and described the daily effort to get food as an act of ""humiliation.""Three medics from Gaza's health ministry were also killed Tuesday in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza City while responding to an earlier strike on a home. The Israeli military did not comment on that attack but said it had targeted Hamas infrastructure in the area.The United Nations has rejected the new Israeli-US aid system, saying it breaks humanitarian rules by limiting access and giving Israel control over who receives food. The UN says its own aid delivery system, now sidelined, is more effective and shows no sign of aid being taken by Hamas.The war began on October 7, 2023, when Hamas launched an attack on southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. Israel's response has killed nearly 55,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's health ministry, which says women and children are the majority of those killed. Israel claims over 20,000 of the dead were militants but has not released evidence.","At least 36 people were killed and more than 200 wounded on Tuesday after gunmen opened fire on Palestinians while they were trying to access food aid in Gaza.

‘Bloody Foreign Invasion Of LA…’: Trump’s CHILLING Order To US Army As Los Angeles Burns | UNCUT





California Governor Gavin Newsom appeared visibly emotional on Tuesday as he addressed the state for the first time since violent protests erupted in Los Angeles, with social media users speculating he was about to cry.The riots by thousands of people followed federal immigration raids and the deployment of the National Guard.With his voice shaking at times, Newsom pleaded with Californians to resist what he described as US President Donald Trump ’s efforts to erode democracy.“What Donald Trump wants most is your fealty, your silence, to be complicit in this moment,” he said. “We all need to stand up and be held to a higher level of accountability.”The governor condemned the federal response to protests as illegal and inflammatory. “These are the men and women trained for foreign combat, not domestic law enforcement,” he said, referring to the National Guard and Marines stationed in Los Angeles. “Democracy is under assault before our eyes.”In the lead-up to the speech, Newsom had already labelled Trump’s actions an “assault on democracy” and said the militarisation of the city was unlawful.During his remarks, he doubled down on those claims, accusing the president of triggering chaos through sweeping deportation actions.“On Saturday morning, when federal agents jumped out of an unmarked van near a Home Depot parking lot, they began grabbing people. A deliberate targeting of a heavily Latino suburb,” Newsom said. “A U.S. citizen, nine months pregnant, was arrested. A four-year-old girl. Taken. Families separated.”He explained that the initial protests were within the bounds of normal public response. But when federal forces intervened, the situation quickly escalated. “What then ensued was a use of tear gas, flashbang grenades, rubber bullets. Federal agents detaining people and undermining their due process rights.”Newsom acknowledged that some of the protests turned violent, citing vandalism and attacks on police officers. Over 220 arrests have been made so far, and more are expected. However, he argued that the president decided to involve military forces that “fanned the flames,"" of protests.He also said that Trump was trying to dictate academic content and undermining the judicial system. “What more evidence do we need than January 6th?” he asked.Newsom confirmed that his office sought an emergency court order to halt the deployment of federal forces in Los Angeles. However, a US federal judge denied his plea to block the National Guard from coming to the state.",California Governor Gavin Newsom appeared visibly emotional as he addressed the state for the first time since violent protests erupted in Los Angeles.

'Same playbook': Vivek Ramaswamy likens Gavin Newsom to George Wallace; says his presidential dreams 'will end in dustbins of history',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/same-playbook-vivek-ramaswamy-likens-gavin-newsom-to-george-wallace-says-his-presidential-dreams-will-end-in-dustbins-of-history/articleshow/121765961.cms,"



Republican firebrand Vivek Ramaswamy sharpened his criticism of California Governor Gavin Newsom on Tuesday, drawing a provocative comparison between the Democrat and former Alabama Governor George Wallace — the segregationist who defied federal desegregation orders during the civil rights era.""There's another Democrat governor from US history that Gavin Newsom is starting to resemble — George Wallace,"" Ramaswamy wrote on X, drawing a controversial line between Wallace’s defiance of desegregation orders in the 1960s and Newsom’s current opposition to President Trump’s deployment of federal forces to assist in immigration raids.Wallace, a symbol of segregation-era defiance, famously resisted federal orders to desegregate Alabama schools, prompting former President John F Kennedy in 1963 and later President Lyndon B Johnson in 1965 to federalize the Alabama National Guard.Former US President Johnson overrode Wallace’s refusal to protect civil rights demonstrators during the Selma to Montgomery march, calling in troops to ensure their safety — a decision that became a defining moment in American history.Now, more than half a century later, the echoes of that federal-state clash are surfacing again.""I actually like Gavin Newsom as a person, but he won’t like this,"" Ramaswamy said. ""George Wallace fought against federal desegregation; Gavin Newsom now fights against federal deportations.Wallace wanted segregated cities; Newsom wants sanctuary cities. Wallace blocked school doors; Newsom blocks ICE vans.""His remarks come amid a deepening standoff between the White House and Sacramento, after President Trump sent thousands of National Guard troops and 700 US Marines to downtown Los Angeles to secure federal buildings and assist ICE in immigration raids. Newsom, who was not consulted in the decision, condemned the move as ""illegal and immoral"" and has taken the administration to court.""Donald Trump is putting fuel on this fire. Commandeering a state's National Guard without consulting the Governor of that state is illegal and immoral,"" Newsom wrote on X earlier this week.For Ramaswamy, the symbolism is deliberate, and sharp. He accuses Newsom of grandstanding for political gain, arguing that the California governor is “rallying radicals” and obstructing federal authority as part of a larger strategy to appeal to progressive voters ahead of a potential 2028 presidential run.“It’s the same playbook all over again: dodge the feds, rally the radicals, and do it in front of the cameras to pander to their base,” Ramaswamy said. “And mark my words: Gavin Newsom’s presidential ambitions will end the same way George Wallace’s did — in the dustbins of history.”",Vivek Ramaswamy drew a provocative comparison between California Governor Gavin Newsom and former Alabama Governor George Wallace.

‘Don't Space Even A Single…’: Trump’s CHILLING Order To US Army As Los Angeles Burns | UNCUT





A federal judge on Tuesday rejected an urgent legal attempt by California governor Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta to block US President Donald Trump ’s deployment of National Guard troops and US Marines in Los Angeles.US District Judge Charles Breyer denied the emergency motion and granted the Trump administration additional time to respond. A hearing has been scheduled for Thursday.The ruling came just hours after the state filed a temporary restraining order against what Newsom described as the “unlawful militarisation” of the city, following large-scale protests triggered by aggressive immigration raids.The legal challenge was part of a wider lawsuit targeting Trump, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, and the department of defense, which accuses the federal government of commandeering state forces for immigration enforcement.Newsom warned that sending in troops would make the situation worse and put people’s safety at risk.“The federal government is now turning the military against American citizens,” the governor said in a statement, according to KTLA television station. “Sending trained warfighters onto the streets is unprecedented and threatens the very core of our democracy. Donald Trump is behaving like a tyrant, not a president, he added.""Tensions in Los Angeles have escalated since Friday when Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) began workplace raids across the city. Protests broke out over the weekend, with demonstrators blocking freeways and setting cars on fire.On Monday, Trump ordered the federalisation of 2,000 California National Guard troops and dispatched 700 Marines to the region, citing a need to maintain order. ICE later confirmed the Guard was helping with officer protection and transportation.Photos released on Tuesday showed National Guard troops accompanying immigration officers during arrests.Meanwhile, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass imposed an overnight curfew in a one-square-mile downtown area, citing the looting of 23 businesses. “We reached a tipping point,” she said during a press conference. The curfew will remain in effect from 8 pm Tuesday to 6 am Wednesday.Trump has described protesters as “animals” and “a foreign enemy”. Speaking at Fort Bragg, he said Los Angeles would have been “completely obliterated” without the Guard deployment.California’s Democratic lawmakers in Congress slammed the move as a “manufactured crisis”.The Pentagon said the cost of deploying the troops stands at $134 million. Protesters continue to rally across the country in solidarity, with demonstrations reported in cities including San Francisco, Chicago, and New York.","Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta filed a temporary restraining order against what Newsom described as the ‘unlawful militarisation’ of the city.

Trump To Deport Elon Musk? Watch Shocking Announcement During Police Huddle With Pam Bondi





After days of sharp exchanges and rising tensions between US President Donald Trump and world's richest man, Elon Musk , signs of de-escalation are beginning to emerge. On Monday, Trump appeared to strike a conciliatory tone when asked whether he would speak with Musk soon.At a White House press conference, a reporter asked: ""Do you plan to speak to Elon Musk on the phone any time soon?""Trump replied: ""Umm... I haven’t really thought about it actually. I would imagine he wants to speak to me. If I were him, I would want to speak to me. Maybe he’s already called. You’d have to ask him. Ask him if he’s already called. But I’d have no problems with it.""He also added ""We had a good relationship and I just wish him well, very well actually.""The remarks follow a high-profile fallout between the two powerful figures. Musk, once a key informal adviser to the Trump administration, publicly broke ranks last week over the president’s sweeping domestic legislation, branded the Big, Beautiful Bill, which Musk harshly criticised.Musk not only accused Trump of lying but also claimed, without evidence, that the president’s name appeared in documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein He suggested the administration was withholding those records.The clash intensified when Musk floated the idea of launching a new political movement called ""the American Party"", prompting Trump to warn that he would act if Musk funded Democratic candidates.However, within a day, tensions began to cool. Musk deleted several inflammatory posts, including the one tying Trump to Epstein. He also reposted a statement from Trump about the Los Angeles immigration protests, adding American flag emojis, a gesture seen by many as an olive branch.Despite their public dispute, Trump made it clear he is not closing the door on future dialogue. His remark that he wouldn’t be surprised if Musk had already reached out signals a possible reopening of communication between the two former allies.","Donald Trump appeared to strike a conciliatory tone when asked whether he would speak with Elon Musk soon.
