INDORE: New CCTV footage that surfaced on Saturday in Raja Raghuvanshi murder case shows prime accused Raj Kushwaha holding a white shroud and a floral garland while standing outside the victim's residence on the day of his funeral.The footage, captured on June 4 when Raja's body was brought to his Indore home, shows Raj not only participating in the rituals but also consoling Sonam Raghuwanshi's father, Devi Singh. Raj is seen placing his hand on Devi Singh's shoulder and remaining close to him throughout the mourning.While pictures of Raj consoling Sonam's father had gone viral on social media earlier, this footage has raised suspicion as it shows him making repeated phone calls during the funeral. Investigators suspect he may have been relaying real-time updates from the house, possibly to Sonam.Officials are now trying to determine whom Raj was communicating with during the funeral and whether the calls were connected to a larger conspiracy behind Raja's murder. ""He was so confident and had the audacity to place a shroud on the coffin of my brother whose murder he conspired. He kept talking to someone on phone during the mourning.We realised this later when we checked the CCTVs. Probably he was talking to Sonam,"" said Vipin Raghuwanshi, Raja's brother.Both Sonam and Raj Kushwaha were produced in court on Saturday and have been sent to judicial custody for 13 days. Three other co-accused are already in jail.A Shillong police team, which is stationed in Indore since Tuesday, continues to question individuals linked to the case. They have interviewed Sonam's parents, Raja's family members, Sonam's co-workers at her brother Govind's factory, and the drivers who took her to Uttar Pradesh.","CCTV footage shows prime accused Raj Kushwaha holding a white shroud and a floral garland while standing outside the victim's residence on the day of his funeral.

‘Congratulations world, it’s time for peace’: Trump

Embassies issue warnings as airspace closures disrupt flights

Airlines react to crisis with advisories and diversions

White House monitoring crisis from Situation Room

Iran late Monday launched a barrage of missiles targeting the US-operated Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, triggering loud explosions across Doha and Lusail. The strike came just hours after Qatar closed its airspace as a precaution, and was later confirmed by Iranian state television as a direct response to recent US attacks on Iran’s nuclear facilities.Iranian media hailed the strike as “a mighty and successful response by the armed forces of Iran to America’s aggression,” accompanied by martial music during the broadcast. Israeli sources, quoted by Axios, claimed the missiles specifically aimed at US positions within the Al Udeid base -- the largest American military facility in the Middle East.Residents in Doha reported hearing a series of deafening explosions, with AFP noting that the night sky lit up with visible projectiles. While there was no immediate confirmation from US or Qatari authorities regarding the extent of damage or potential casualties, embassies, including India's, swiftly issued advisories urging citizens to stay indoors.US President Donald Trump downplayed the scale of the Iranian retaliation, describing it as “a very weak response, which we expected, and have very effectively countered.” In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote, “There have been 14 missiles fired — 13 were knocked down, and 1 was ‘set free,’ because it was headed in a nonthreatening direction.”“I am pleased to report that NO Americans were harmed, and hardly any damage was done. Most importantly, they’ve gotten it all out of their ‘system,’ and there will, hopefully, be no further HATE,” Trump added, signalling hopes for a de-escalation.Trump also extended thanks to Iranian authorities for what he described as an “early notice,” which allowed the US to preemptively take defensive measures. “Perhaps Iran can now proceed to Peace and Harmony in the Region, and I will enthusiastically encourage Israel to do the same,” he said.In another post, Trump thanked the Emir of Qatar and emphasised that there were no Qatari casualties either. “I’d like to thank the Highly Respected Emir of Qatar for all that he has done in seeking Peace for the Region. In addition to no Americans being killed or wounded, very importantly, there have also been no Qataris killed or wounded,” Trump said.He ended his remarks with a dramatic flourish: “CONGRATULATIONS WORLD, IT’S TIME FOR PEACE!”“In view of the ongoing situation, Indian community in Qatar is urged to be cautious and remain indoors. Please remain calm and follow local news, instructions, and guidance provided by Qatari authorities,” read an official statement from the Indian embassy in Doha. “The Embassy will also keep updating through our social media channels.”Two US officials later confirmed to Reuters that there were no American casualties from the attack. The officials said Iran had used both short- and medium-range missiles in the strike, with most intercepted before causing significant damage.The missile count, according to Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, mirrored the number of bombs dropped by the US during its recent air strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. The council stressed that the selected base was “far from residential areas” and posed no threat to Qatar, described as “our friendly and brotherly neighbour.”Qatar’s foreign ministry meanwhile said the situation was “under control,” although the underlying tensions continue to reverberate across the region. Bahrain, which hosts the US Navy’s Fifth Fleet, temporarily halted air traffic, adding to the widespread disruption.Amid the uncertainty, airlines adjusted operations in and around Qatar. IndiGo issued a travel advisory, noting, “In view of the evolving situation in the Middle East, some of our flights may experience delays or diversions. These adjustments are being made to ensure operations remain within safe and compliant airspace.”Air India Express confirmed two Qatar-bound flights had been diverted. “As a result of the ongoing situation in the Middle East and the suspension of Qatar airspace, Air India Express has diverted our Doha-bound flight from Kochi to Muscat and returned our flight bound from Kannur,” a spokesperson said.“We are monitoring the situation closely and will take all necessary precautions for the safety and security of our guests and crew… We regret the inconvenience due to circumstances beyond our control,” the airline added.The White House confirmed that US President Donald Trump was in the Situation Room with Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman General John Caine. Reuters reported that the senior leadership team was actively monitoring developments as the crisis unfolded.The Iranian attack followed a surprise joint US-Israeli strike on three Iranian nuclear facilities over the weekend -- a move that Tehran had warned would trigger “unpredictable consequences.” Al Udeid Air Base is a critical hub for US military operations in the region, housing the Combined Air Operations Center and the 379th Air Expeditionary Wing — the largest such unit in the world.In a message posted on X just before the attack, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian declared, “We neither initiated the war nor seeking it. But we will not leave invasion to the great Iran without answer.”","US President Donald Trump downplays scale of Iranian retaliation, describing it as “a very weak response, which we expected, and have very effectively countered” US officials later confirmed there were no American casualties from the attack.

'Prime asset for India on global stage': Tharoor praises PM Modi again; BJP uses his remark to target Rahul,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/prime-asset-for-india-on-global-stage-tharoor-praises-pm-modi-again-bjp-uses-his-remark-to-target-rahul/articleshow/122031228.cms,"Shashi Tharoor with PM Modi.

Tharoor has 'exposed' Rahul

NEW DELHI: Shashi Tharoor , whose frosty ties with the Congress leadership is now an open secret, has yet again taken a diametrically opposite stand from his party and praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the global diplomatic outreach following "" Operation Sindoor "".In an article published in The Hindu, Tharoor said: ""Prime Minister Narendra Modi's energy, dynamism and willingness to engage remains a prime asset for India on the global stage but deserves greater backing.""""The diplomatic outreach following 'Operation Sindoor' was a moment of national resolve and effective communication. It affirmed that India, when united, can project its voice with clarity and conviction on international platforms,"" the Congress leader wrote in the article.Tharoor had led one of the seven multi-party delegations to convey India's stand following the Pahalgam terror attack and the military operation.Only last week, Tharoor had admitted to ""differences of opinion with some in party leadership"". Ironically, Shashi Tharoor's latest round of praise for PM Modi comes on a day the Congress made a notable electoral victory in Kerala wresting the Nilambur assembly seat from the LDF after nine years.Tharoor had stayed away from party's campaign in Nilambur bypoll. While the Congress MP had said that he was not invited, the Congress maintained that his name was in the list of star campaigners for the bypoll.The Congress had dubbed the Nilambur bypolls as the semi-finals ahead of the assembly elections in the state next year. The win will give the party a boost as it goes all out to wrest power from the LDF after 10 years.Tharoor's praise for the Prime Minister comes at a time when the Congress has been consistently attacking the Modi government over its foreign policy, alleging that Indian diplomacy is being ""shattered"" and the country stands ""isolated"" globally.Following the Pahalgam attack, Tharoor has made several comments on the India-Pakistan conflict and the diplomatic outreach that are at variance with the stand taken by the Congress party. Led by Rahul Gandhi, the Congress has been questioning the government over US President Donald Trump's claims of mediating a ceasefire between the two countries.The BJP was quick once again to use Tharoor's remarks to target the Congress as it has done several times in the past few months. The party took a swipe at the Congress over Tharoor's article and said the Thiruvananthapuram MP has ""exposed"" Rahul Gandhi. BJP's national spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari said on X, ""Shashi Tharoor admits that PM Modi's dynamism and global outreach are a strategic advantage for India.""The Prime Minister's Office did its bit to return favourt to the Congress MP and shared Tharoor's article on X and said, ""Lok Sabha MP and former Union Minister Dr. Shashi Tharoor writes- Lessons from Operation Sindoor's global outreach.""","Shashi Tharoor has taken a diametrically opposite stand from his party.

‘Ironic for Pakistan to talk about human rights’

NEW DELHI: India on Monday strongly rejected “unwarranted and factually incorrect references” made about the country during the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Council of foreign ministers’ meeting.“These statements, driven by Pakistan, which has turned terrorism into statecraft, reflect the continued misuse of the OIC platform for narrow political ends,” the ministry of external affairs (MEA) said in a detailed statement.The MEA criticised the OIC for its continued failure to acknowledge the “real and documented threat of terrorism emanating from Pakistan,” citing the recent terror attack in Pahalgam as a recent example.“This reflects a wilful disregard for facts and the global consensus on the fight against terrorism,” the ministry added.India firmly reiterated that the OIC has “no locus standi to comment on India's internal affairs, including Jammu & Kashmir,” which the ministry described as “an integral and sovereign part of India, a fact enshrined in the Indian Constitution and irreversibly settled.”Calling the OIC’s silence and actions troubling, the MEA warned the organisation of the “perils of allowing Pakistan’s propaganda to hijack and politicise its agenda,” and said that continuing on this path would “undermine the OIC’s credibility and relevance.”Responding to comments made by Pakistan at the OIC meeting, India said they were nothing more than a desperate attempt to distract from Islamabad’s “appalling record of state-sponsored terrorism, minority persecution, sectarian violence, and governance failure.”India also rejected Pakistan’s allegation of “unprovoked and unjustified military aggression” and defended its counter-terror operation post-Pahalgam.“Operation Sindoor was a precise and legitimate act of self-defence against terrorist camps operating from Pakistani territory,” the MEA said, adding that Pakistan’s retaliatory efforts were reckless, endangered civilians, and resulted in multiple civilian casualties.In its closing remarks, the ministry said it was “ironic” for Pakistan, a country with an “abysmal human rights record” and a “history of sheltering, breeding and empowering terrorists”, to lecture others on counter-terrorism and human rights.","India strongly rejected “unwarranted and factually incorrect references’ made about the country during the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Council of foreign ministers’ meeting. “These statements, driven by Pakistan, which has turned terrorism into statecraft, reflect the continued misuse of the OIC platform for narrow political ends,” the ministry of external affairs said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122029099,imgsize-964077,width-400,resizemode-4/122029099.jpg"
"In UP village, forgotten Indian roots of Ayatollah Khomeini",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-up-village-forgotten-indian-roots-of-ayatollah-khomeini/articleshow/122010671.cms,"KINTOOR (BARABANKI): In Kintoor, a tranquil village of 13,000 nestled along the Ghaghara, 70 kilometres from Lucknow, only five Shia families remain. Among them, the Kazmis claim a distant kinship with Syed Ahmad Musavi Hindi, grandfather of Ayatollah Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini, the fiery cleric who ignited Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution and became its first Supreme Leader.Born in Kintoor in the early 19th century, Ahmad’s journey from this unassuming village wove a legacy that reshaped West Asia’s history. He left India, escaping colonial rule in 1830, migrating to Najaf, and then finally settling in Khomeyn in 1834. Hence the family name.A portrait of Ruhollah Khomeini still hanging in his drawing room, septuagenarian Syed Nihal Kazmi says, “My great-great-great-grandfather Mufti Mohammad Quli Musavi and Syed Ahmad Musavi were cousins. Ahmad’s story began here in Kintoor, but he became Iran’s forever.” The village, once a vibrant hub of Shia scholarship in the kingdom of Oudh, is concerned with the war in West Asia.BBC journalist and author Baqer Moin, in his book Khomeini: Life of the Ayatollah, writes that Syed Ahmad Musavi Hindi left Kintoor around 1830, drawn to Najaf, Iraq, for pilgrimage. There, he befriended Yusef Khan Kamarchi, a landowner from Farahan, near Khomeyn, Iran.Persuaded by Yusef, Ahmad settled in Iran in 1839, purchasing a sprawling house and garden in Khomeyn that remained in the family for over a century.Ahmad went to become a Twelver Shia cleric. From his third wife, Sakineh Ahmad, who was his friend Yusef’s sister, Ahmad had three daughters and a son, Syed Mostafa, father of Ruhollah Khomeini. Ahmad died in 1869 and was buried in Karbala.The Musavi family’s roots trace back to Nishapur (or Neyshabur), Iran, over 2,500 kilometres from Kintoor. “In the early 18th century (1700), they migrated to India, settling in Kintoor,” Moin notes. The family, Musavi Syeds, claimed descent from the Prophet through his daughter and the seventh Shia Imam, Musa al-Kazim, a lineage rooted in Nishapur.Syed Adil Kazmi, Nihal’s youngest son and an LLB graduate, says, “Our ancestors’ journey from Nishapur to Kintoor, and Ahmad’s return to Iran, tied two worlds together.”Today, Iran’s defiance under Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei echoes Khomeini’s unyielding spirit. “Long before Khamenei or the 1979 revolution led by Khomeini, it was Ahmad, born in our Kintoor, whose choice to settle in Iran changed West Asia’s discourse,” Adil says.From Ahmad’s departure to Khomeini’s revolution, Kintoor’s quiet lanes hold stories of faith, migration, and a family that bridged continents, leaving an indelible mark on history.Kintoor’s legacy also includes Justice Syed Karamat Husain, a Musavi Syed who rose to the position of a judge at the Allahabad high court and founded the Karamat Husain Muslim Girls’ PG College in Lucknow, championing education for women.","The Kazmis claim a distant kinship with Syed Ahmad Musavi Hindi, grandfather of Ayatollah Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini.

SRINAGAR: J&K National Conference president Dr Farooq Abdullah announced on Monday the formation of a new human rights body, calling it a temporary alternative to the defunct State Human Rights Commission (SHRC).“Until statehood is restored and a formal SHRC is reestablished, this body will operate in its place,” Dr Abdullah told TOI.The newly formed body will be headed by party legislator and retired high court judge Hasnain Masoodi. Two additional members, including a woman, will also be appointed to the human rights panel.“We felt the need to set up this body because of the growing number of human rights issues in Jammu and Kashmir ,” Dr Abdullah said. “In the absence of an official commission, this wing will take cognisance of rights violations and ensure that concerns are raised and addressed,” he said.In October 2019, after the nullification of Article 370, J&K SHRC was shut down, leaving hundreds of cases unresolved. The SHRC, established in 1997, had handled around 8,529 cases before it was shut down. It was the only quasi-judicial body created under the now repealed J&K Protection of Human Rights Act and was supposed to investigate human rights violations cases, particularly after insurgency erupted in Kashmir in 1990.At the time of its closure in 2019, hundreds of cases related to alleged rights violations remained pending.“Our human rights body will look into grievances and complaints of rights violations. People will have a forum to come forward. There are serious issues, like the Public Safety Act, shifting of prisoners, and more. At the very least this body will give people a platform to articulate their concerns, and help follow up cases of human rights violations,” Hasnain Massoodi said.","The newly formed body will be headed by party legislator and retired high court judge Hasnain Masoodi.

'This is our Berlin wall moment'



Reza Pahlavi pushes for regime change; US unsure







Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran's last shah, urged Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to step down now if he wants to get a fair trial, something that Reza said Khamenei never gave to any Iranian. Reza Pahlavi announced that he was ready to take the regime over and he was setting up a new secure platform for dissidents and internal opponents of the regime to coordinate their efforts to overthrow the disctatorrshio and put the country on the path of a ""free and democratic"" future.“We are a proud, ancient and resilient people,” Pahlavi told a press conference in Paris on Monday. “To my compatriots: This is our moment. I am with you. Let us build this new Iran together.”“I am here today to submit myself to my compatriots to lead them down this road of peace.”Pahlavi said he has spoken with people across Iran and realized that this is Iran's Berlin Wall moment. ""But like all moments of great change, it comes fraught with danger. We stand at a crossroads. One road leads to bloodshed and chaos. The other—to a peaceful and democratic transition,"" he said.The destruction of the Natanz, Isfahan and Fordow has diminished the regime's domestic nuclear enrichment, he said. ""But it does not diminish the regime’s intent to acquire and use nuclear weapons. The regime, enraged and emboldened, will be seeking revenge and can acquire nuclear weapons from other rogue regimes like North Korea,"" he said.Reza Pahlavi offered his plan for transition and national renewal based on three core principles: Iran;s territorial integrity, individual liberties and equality of all citizens, and separation of religion and state.""We have already launched the Iran Prosperity Project (IPP) , a comprehensive plan for the economic reconstruction and social stabilization of our country in three phases. The Emergency Phase of the first 4-6 months, the Establishment Phase of 18-24 months, and the Normalization Phase which is long term,"" he said.While the exiled crown prince pushed for a regime change in Iran, the US is not certain of what it wants. Vice President JD Vance categorically said the US is not in a war with Iran and is not attempting regime change in Iran.But President Donald Trump contradicted that claim and said if the current regime in Iran is unable to 'Make Iran Great Again', then why there would not be a regime change.""It's not politically correct to use the term, 'Regime Change', but if the current Iranian Regime is unable to Make Iran Great Again, why wouldn't there be a Regime Change?

Iran’s underground nuclear enrichment site at Fordo was struck again on Monday, Iranian state television reported, a day after the United States bombed the facility using heavy bunker-buster bombs in a major escalation of the ongoing conflict.The Israeli military confirmed on Monday that it launched air raids to “obstruct access routes” to the Fordo facility, stating that the strike was intended to cut off movement around the enrichment site.“Israeli forces struck in order to obstruct access routes to the Fordo enrichment site,” the military said. US President Donald Trump had earlier said the Fordo site had been “totally obliterated” in Sunday’s US strike.In Vienna, Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said Sunday’s attack likely caused heavy destruction at the sensitive facility. “Given the explosive payload utilized and the extreme vibration-sensitive nature of centrifuges, very significant damage is expected to have occurred,” Grossi noted. He added that the IAEA has yet to fully assess the underground impact.The US described its Sunday strike on Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan as a one-time operation to damage Iran’s nuclear infrastructure.However, President Trump warned that more strikes could follow if Iran retaliates. Iran condemned the attack as a violation of its sovereignty and likened it to an invasion.On Monday, Iran responded by launching missiles and drones toward Israel, targeting cities such as Haifa and Tel Aviv. Explosions were also heard in Jerusalem. Iranian state television said the barrage was part of a new wave under “Operation True Promise 3.” Israel activated its defence systems and advised residents in northern and central areas to take shelter.Iranian General Abdolrahim Mousavi, chief of the joint staff, warned that the US airstrikes had given Iranian forces a “free hand” to act against American interests and forces in the region. Tens of thousands of US troops are stationed across the Middle East, many within range of Iran’s short-range missiles.Amid rising tensions, global calls for restraint have grown. European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas urged a return to diplomacy and warned that Iran’s potential closure of the Strait of Hormuz, a key oil shipping route, would be “extremely dangerous.” The EU said Iran must be ready to return to direct talks with the US to help resolve the crisis.The conflict comes against the backdrop of the collapse of the 2015 nuclear agreement. After the US withdrew from the deal during Trump’s first term, Iran began enriching uranium up to 60% purity and restricted access to international inspectors. On Monday, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi held talks in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a key Iranian ally.","Israel confirms Monday strike, says aim was to block access to Fordo enrichment site.

In a significant escalation of regional tensions, Iran launched several missiles targeting US base in Qatar on Monday night, specifically striking the Al Udeid Air Base, the largest American military installation in the Middle East. The attack came in direct retaliation for the recent US airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities, according to Axios, which cited an Israeli official.Shortly after Qatar shut its airspace as a precaution, loud explosions were heard across Doha and Lusail, and projectiles were seen streaking through the night sky, according to eyewitnesses and AFP journalists.Iran’s state television broadcast footage of the strike, accompanied by martial music, with a caption declaring it “a mighty and successful response by the armed forces of Iran to America’s aggression,” Reuters reported. Iran's military later confirmed that the missile strike on Al Udeid was “devastating and powerful.”Iran’s top security body issued a statement saying that its armed forces used the same number of bombs that the US had deployed during its attack on Iranian nuclear sites. The statement added that the base targeted was far from urban and residential areas in Qatar and emphasized that the operation posed no threat to its ""friendly and brotherly"" neighbour Qatar.The missile campaign, dubbed ""Annunciation of Victory"" by Iran’s Tasnim news agency, was part of a broader response that also included attacks on US bases in Iraq, according to a security official cited by the AP.Meanwhile, Bahrain, home to the US Navy’s Fifth Fleet, issued a public alert urging citizens to remain calm and proceed to the nearest safe location. The US Embassy in Doha, along with other Western embassies, advised residents to shelter in place until further notice.Qatar’s foreign ministry acknowledged the attack and said the country “reserves the right to respond directly and in accordance with international law.” However, it reassured the public that the security situation remains stable and stated that Doha is working closely with regional and international partners to de-escalate tensions.The Al Udeid Air Base, located southwest of Doha, houses thousands of American troops and serves as a critical operational hub for US military activities across the Middle East.In a related development, the Israeli military announced that approximately 15 fighter jets, under the guidance of the IDF Intelligence Directorate, carried out a series of strikes on missile and UAV storage sites in western Iran. Targets included underground military infrastructure and arms depots linked to the Iranian Armed Forces, according to a statement posted on the IDF's official Telegram channel.As of now, there has been no official response from the US Department of Defense or CENTCOM regarding the Iranian missile strike, including details on damage or casualties.","Iran launched several missiles targeting US base in Qatar on Monday night, specifically striking the Al Udeid Air Base.

Qatar confirmed that no injuries or human casualties occurred after Iran launched a missile attack on the Al-Udeid Air Base, which hosts US and allied forces southwest of Doha on Monday.According to Qatar’s official statement, the base had been evacuated earlier as part of established precautionary measures in response to rising regional tensions. The statement assured that “all necessary steps were taken to ensure the safety of Qatari Armed Forces, friendly troops, and other personnel stationed at the base.”“We confirm that no injuries or human casualties resulted from the attack,” the government said.Qatar added that its air defense systems successfully intercepted the missiles launched by Iran, describing the response as effective and timely.The missile strike, claimed by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, targeted Al-Udeid Air Base, the largest US facility in the Middle East and the forward headquarters of US Central Command (CENTCOM), home to approximately 10,000 troops.Qatar strongly condemned the attack, calling it a “flagrant violation of its sovereignty, airspace, international law, and the UN Charter.”The government warned that it reserves the right to respond proportionally and in accordance with international law.“We consider this a brazen aggression and affirm Qatar's right to respond directly in line with the nature and scale of the attack,” the statement read.Qatar also stressed that such acts of escalation risk pulling the region into wider conflict, warning of “catastrophic consequences for international peace and security.”Calling for restraint, Doha urged all parties to immediately cease military actions and return to serious diplomatic dialogue. It reiterated its longstanding position against regional escalation and said it had earlier warned of the dangers posed by increasing Israeli military actions.“We reaffirm that dialogue is the only way to overcome the current crises and ensure the security of the region and the peace of its people,” the statement concluded.","Iran launched a missile attack on the Al-Udeid Air Base southwest of Doha on Monday.

Poll Should legal protections for men facing harassment be strengthened? Yes, definitely No, existing laws are sufficient





ROHTAK: A man died by suicide after allegedly being harassed by his wife, Divya, and her alleged lover, Deepak, a police inspector said. The victim has been identified as Magan alias Ajay.A video that Magan received just before ending his life has now surfaced, showing Divya dancing while her boyfriend records the footage. During the video, the two can be seen engaging in obscene behaviour.According to Magan's family, Divya herself sent this video to her husband. The emotional trauma that followed reportedly led Magan to hang himself last week.Before dying, Magan recorded a video where he alleged that his wife Divya and her police officer boyfriend were mentally harassing him. He claimed Divya pressured him to murder his own father and sell ancestral land so that Deepak could get a promotion in his police job. In the video, Magan appealed to the police to take strict action against both of them.Magan’s body was found hanging from a tree on the night of June 18 in Dobh village here. His family found the body after they began searching for him upon seeing the suicide video he posted on social media earlier that morning.In the video, Magan clearly held his wife Divya and her lover Deepak responsible for his suicide. He stated, “Divya has an affair with Deepak, a policeman posted in Sambhajinagar (formerly Aurangabad), Maharashtra. Both of them have mentally tortured me.”He further revealed that both Divya and Deepak pressurised him to kill his father and sell ancestral property. “They want to buy a flat in Mumbai using that money. But I can't kill my father, so I am ending my life,” Magan said.Magan also claimed that Deepak needed Rs 5 lakh for a job promotion. “After selling wheat, I gave Rs 1.5 lakh to Divya. On June 9, 2025, I mortgaged my gold bracelet and gave her another Rs 2 lakh. The transaction records are in a file kept at home. Even after paying Rs 3.5 lakh, they were demanding another Rs 1.5 lakh from me,” he said.Magan said he discovered 1.5 years into the marriage that Divya was already married and had a son from that marriage. She did not legally divorce before marrying him. “When I consulted a lawyer, he advised me to file a case since Hindu law doesn't allow remarriage without divorce. But I never took action and instead paid her to settle with her first husband.”In his last video, Magan addressed his rakhi sister, Savita Arya from Panipat, who works for women's rights. He said, “Even if a woman is wrong, she gets sympathy by shedding a few tears. But even a right man ends up losing his life. Please do something for men too.”He also appealed to Rohtak MP Deepender Hooda and Meham MLA Balram Dangi. “After my death, my son should stay with my parents. They are losing their only son. I urge the MP and MLA to visit my home and assure my parents that no one will take my son away from them.”Magan’s family said the couple met through social media in 2019 and later registered their marriage. Initially, the family did not approve, but after Divya gave birth to a son, they accepted her.Magan’s family stated that Divya had a job but never disclosed what it was. She often stayed away from home for days, using work as an excuse. They suspect it was during these trips that she met Deepak in Maharashtra.She left home on March 20, 2025, saying she was going for work but never returned. She remained in contact over the phone for a while and was later found to be living with Deepak in Maharashtra, from where she allegedly continued to harass Magan.ASI Sanjay from Bahu Akbarpur Police Station stated that efforts are being made to trace Divya. A team visited her parental home in Narnaund, Hisar, but family members claimed to have had no contact with her for years.Police are examining Magan’s call records and bank transactions. Once evidence is consolidated, a team will be dispatched to Maharashtra to locate and apprehend Divya.","Magan’s body was found hanging from a tree on the night of June 18 in Dobh village here.

Actor Srikanth arrested after police seize cocaine from his city residence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/actor-srikanth-arrested-after-police-seize-cocaine-from-his-city-residence/articleshow/122033286.cms,"Actor Srikanth





CHENNAI: Tamil film actor Srikanth, 46, who has acted in 54 movies including 11 in Telugu and five in Malayalam was on Monday arrested by the Chennai police in connection with a cocaine smuggling racket. The arrest followed the detention of T Prasad, an AIADMK IT wing functionary who is suspected to have supplied the drug to the actor. Srikanth was taken into custody after police recovered cocaine from his residence and confirmed drug use through medical tests. Police said they were probing the involvement of another Kollywood actor, whose identity cannot be revealed at this stage.It all began on June 17 when the Anti-Narcotics Intelligence Unit (ANIU) of the city police arrested Pradeep Kumar alias Prado, 38, of Salem and John, 38, a Ghana national in Nungambakkam for possession of 11g cocaine. Based on information provided by Pradeep, police learned that the drug was sourced from T Prasad and sold to Srikanth at a pub in Nungambakkam in May.Police subsequently raided Srikanth’s residence in the Nungambakkam Lake area and recovered small quantities of cocaine kept for ‘personal use’.Srikanth was detained for questioning and later arrested after his blood samples tested positive for narcotics. He was taken to Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital for an examination and produced before the II metropolitan magistrate court in Egmore.Police said Prasad was earlier arrested following a drunken brawl at the same pub. Further investigations into his activities led to the unearthing of multiple criminal links, including drug trafficking, a job scam and attempts to influence police officials. At least six cases have been registered against him so far. He was detained under the Goondas Act as well. Sources said two police personnel — sub-inspector Mani Durai and constable Senthilkumar — were also arrested on charges of assisting Pradeep Kumar in a fake job racket. Senthilkumar, who served as the personal security officer to CPM MP Su Venkatesan, was picked up from Madurai and brought to Chennai on Thursday. Another SI from the Coimbatore Anti-Terror unit has also been detained based on digital evidence.The job scam surfaced during investigations into the pub brawl involving Prasad, AIADMK functionary Ajay Vandaiyar and history-sheeter Nagendra Sethupathi. So far, at least three complaints have been registered in Nungambakkam and Mylapore police stations.","Srikanth, 46, who has acted in 54 movies including 11 in Telugu and five in Malayalam was on Monday arrested by the Chennai police in connection with a cocaine smuggling racket.

US border patrol is increasingly seen far from the border as Trump ramps up deportation arrests,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-border-patrol-is-increasingly-seen-far-from-the-border-as-trump-ramps-up-deportation-arrests/articleshow/122037990.cms,"AP image

Here are things to know about the trend:





McALLEN: Immigration arrests seen on video are showing an emerging trend: More border patrol agents are doing their jobs far from the borders with Mexico or Canada.A border patrol agent was seen hitting a Southern California landscaper on the head and neck as he was pinned to the ground during an arrest Saturday. The department of homeland security said the man swung his weed trimmer at agents. The man's son, Alejandro Barranco, a Marine veteran, said his father was scared but did not attack anyone.With border arrests at the lowest levels in about 60 years, the roughly 20,000 border patrol agents are showing up elsewhere.Why is the border patrol working away from the border? President Donald Trump's House-approved ""big, beautiful bill"" proposes $8 billion to increase US immigration and customs enforcement staff by 10,000 people. Until then, the agency primarily responsible for interior enforcement is relying on other federal agencies as it struggles to meet a daily arrest target of at least 3,000 set by Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff and chief architect of immigration policy.ICE, with only about 6,000 deportation officers, has found a ready partner in the Border Patrol, which is also part of the US department of homeland security.It comes at a time when border arrests plunged to an average of 282 a day in May after peaking at more than 8,000 a day in December 2023.Agents in the border patrol's Yuma, Arizona, sector assisted ICE officers last week in Philadelphia, Justin De La Torre, the sector chief, said in a social media post. His sector averaged only four arrests a day on the Arizona border last month after peaking at more than 1,100 a day in May 2023.Greg Bovino, chief of the border patrol's El Centro, California, sector, appeared alongside US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem at a news conference this month in Los Angeles during which US Sen Alex Padilla was forcefully removed, pushed to the ground and handcuffed.""We're here and not going away,"" Bovino said, introducing himself to reporters as his agency's top representative during ICE-led operations in Los Angeles.Few see any reason to doubt the border patrol will remain.""So long as the border remains relatively quiet, we will continue to see the Border Patrol deployed to act almost as if they are ICE agents,"" said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American immigration council, an advocacy group.What is the 100-mile border zone? Agents are granted by federal law the ability to stop and question people within 100 miles (161 kilometers) of the border, including the coasts. They have heightened authority to board and search buses, trains and vessels without a warrant within the zone.That encompasses vast swaths of the country that include about two-thirds of the US population, according to the American civil liberties union. Los Angeles is well within 100 miles of the Pacific Ocean.Beyond that zone, agents are still authorised to work within the United States.""The border patrol can still operate fully in the interior. It's just that they have less authority to stop and question people,"" said Reichlin-Melnick.What can the border patrol do beyond the 100 miles? Past the 100-mile enforcement zone, border patrol agents, like officers working for ICE or the US customs and border protection office of field operations, are classified as immigration officers who are authorised to carry out arrests and detain people on suspicion of violating immigration law. There are some limits.""They could only search somebody's car on probable cause that the person has violated the law,"" Reichlin-Melnick said. ""And so people have somewhat heightened rights against search and seizure outside of the 100-mile zone than they do inside of the 100-mile zone. But each individual case will vary depending on the specific circumstances.""","More border patrol agents are doing their jobs far from the borders with Mexico or Canada.

JAKARTA: Indonesian authorities said Monday they arrested 285 people suspected of drug trafficking, including 29 women and seven foreigners, and seized over half a ton of narcotics during a two-month crackdown.Indonesia is a major hub for drug trafficking in Southeast Asia despite having strict drug laws, with convicted smugglers sometimes executed by firing squad.The head of the National Narcotic Agency, Marthinus Hukom, said the crackdown, launched between April and June across 20 provinces, also uncovered money laundering schemes by two drug syndicates and confiscated assets worth more than 26 billion rupiah (about $1.5 million).Thirty-six of the suspects, including 21 women, were paraded in front of reporters, along with confiscated drugs, in their orange prison uniforms and hands handcuffed.Hukom said the women arrested were mostly married without jobs outside the home.""I call on Indonesian women to be more vigilant in establishing friendships both in the real world and in cyberspace,"" he said during a joint press conference with officials from the security affairs ministry and the customs office who took part in the operation.One of the agency's deputies, Budi Wibowo, said authorities seized 683,885 grams (0.68 ton) of crystal meth, marijuana, ecstasy, THC, hashish and amphetamines, adding this helped stop them falling into the hands of ""more than 1.3 million people.""Wibowo also said that drug syndicates have used various methods to distribute narcotics to users via land and sea transportation or mail services.The seven foreign nationals were an American, two Kazakhs, two Malaysians, an Indian and an Australian, Wibowo said.The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime says Indonesia is a major drug-smuggling hub in part because international drug syndicates target its young population.In a separate operation, authorities in the province of Riau Island, exposed in May two cases of drug smuggling in its waters and seized 2.7 tons of crystal methamphetamine and 1.2 tons of ketamine, Hukom said Monday.In 2023, authorities uncovered more than 52,000 of drug cases and confiscated 6.2 tons of crystal meth, 1.1 tons of marijuana and other types of synthetic narcotics, said Mochammad Hasan of the ministry of security affairs during the press conference.Hasan said the number increased in 2024 with more than 56,000 cases and confiscated 7.5 tons of crystal meth and 3.3 tons of marijuana, with a combine value worth 7.5 trillion rupiah ($454.6 million). Authorities have arrested a total of 27,357 drug suspects by November 2024, he said.Early this month, three British nationals accused of smuggling nearly a kilogram (over 2 pounds) of cocaine into Indonesia were charged in a court on the tourist island of Bali. They face the death penalty under the country's strict drug laws.About 530 people, including 96 foreigners, are on death row in Indonesia, mostly for drug-related crimes, the Ministry of Immigration and Corrections' data showed. Indonesia's last executions, of an Indonesian and three foreigners, were carried out in July 2016.","Indonesia is a major hub for drug trafficking in Southeast Asia despite having strict drug laws.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Monday called the 1985 Air India Flight 182 Kanishka bombing the ""deadliest attack"" in Canada's history.In a message posted on X, he said the Canadian government ""unequivocally stands against terrorism.""Carney said, ""40 years ago, Canada faced the deadliest terrorist attack in its history. Today, we mourn the 268 Canadian victims of the Air India bombing and all who have been killed in acts of terrorism -- a sombre reminder of our commitment to fight violent extremism and keep Canadians safe.""On June 23, 1985, Air India Flight 182 was blown up mid-air near Cork, Ireland, killing all 329 people on board. The bombing was carried out by Babbar Khalsa, a Canada-based Khalistani terrorist group. Most of the victims were Canadian citizens of Indian origin.In his official statement marking the National Day of Remembrance for Victims of Terrorism, Carney said, ""As we mark the National Day of Remembrance for Victims of Terrorism, we remember the victims of the Air India bombing and all others who have lost their lives to terrorism.

WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump's first appearance at since returning to the White House was supposed to centre on how the US secured a historic military spending pledge from others in the defensive alliance - effectively bending it to its will.But in the spotlight instead now is Trump's decision to strike three nuclear enrichment facilities in Iran that the administration says eroded Tehran's nuclear ambitions as well as the president's sudden announcement that Israel and Iran had reached a ""complete and total ceasefire."" The sharp U-turn in hostilities just hours before he was set to depart for the summit is sure to dominate the discussions in The Hague, Netherlands.The impact of the strikes had already begun to shape the summit, with Secretary-General Mark Rutte dancing around the issue even as hundreds of people showed up in The Hague on Sunday to denounce the conflict in a protest that was supposed to be focused on defence spending.Still, other countries have become accustomed to the unpredictable when it comes to Trump, who has made no secret of his disdain for the alliance, which was created as a bulwark against threats from the former Soviet Union.Trump's debut on the stage at the 2017 summit was perhaps most remembered by his shove of Dusko Markovic, the prime minister of Montenegro, as the US president jostled toward the front of the pack of world leaders during a headquarters tour.And he began the 2018 summit by questioning the value of the decades-old military alliance and accusing its members of not contributing enough money for their defence - themes he has echoed since. In Brussels, Trump floated a 4 percent target of defense spending as a percentage of a country's gross domestic product, a figure that seemed unthinkable at the time.Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, will also attend the summit this week. She said if Trump does anything to sow division within the alliance, it would benefit Xi Jinping of China, which countries have accused of enabling Russia as it invades Ukraine.""That does not help America, does not help our national security,"" Shaheen said in an interview. ""What it does is hand a victory to our adversaries, and for an administration that claims to be so concerned about the threat from (China), to behave in that way is hard to understand.""Trump heavily telegraphed his attitude toward global alliances during his presidential campaigns.As a candidate in 2016, Trump suggested that he as president would not necessarily heed the alliance's mutual defense guarantees outlined in Article 5 of the treaty. And during a campaign rally in 2024, Trump recounted a conversation with another leader during which Trump said he would ""encourage"" Russia ""to do whatever the hell they want"" to members who weren't meeting the alliance's military spending targets.In The Hague, Trump will want to tout - and take credit for - the pledge to hike military spending, which requires other countries to invest in their defense at an unprecedented scale.The president went as far as to argue that the US should not have to abide by the 5 percent spending pledge he wants imposed on the other countries.That 5 percent is effectively divided into two parts. The first, 3.5 percent, is meant to be made up of traditional military spending such as tanks, warplanes and air defence. What can comprise the remaining 1.5 percent is a bit fuzzier, but it can include things like roads and bridges that troops could use to travel. According to , the US was spending about 3.4 percent of its gross domestic product on defence as of 2024.Most countries - with Spain as the key holdout - are preparing to endorse the pledge, motivated not just by Russian President Vladimir Putin 's invasion of Ukraine to bolster their own defences but also perhaps appease the United States and its tempestuous leader.""He hasn't said this in a while, but there are still a lot of worries in Europe that maybe the United States will pull out of , maybe the United States won't honour Article 5,"" said Matthew Kroenig, vice president and senior director of the Atlantic Council's Scowcroft Centre for Strategy and Security and a former Pentagon official. ""I think there is a real fear among Europeans that we need to deliver for Trump in order to keep the United States engaged in . ""Kroenig added: ""Like it or not, I do think Trump's tougher style does get more results.""European allies have taken note of potential signs of a broader US retreat. France and other countries have been concerned that the Trump administration is considering reducing troop levels in Europe and shift them over to the Indo-Pacific, which Cabinet officials have signaled is a higher priority.Still, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and US Ambassador to Matt Whitaker have underscored the US' commitment and have said the Trump administration is only seeking a stronger alliance.""There's sort of - in some ways - not a coherent view coming from this administration, the Trump administration, about how it sees ,"" said Max Bergmann, the director of the Europe, Russia and Eurasia program at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. ""And right now, Europeans can kind of see what they want from the United States.""The White House has not said which world leaders Trump will meet with at the World Forum in The Hague. It's unclear whether Trump's path will cross with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's; the two leaders were scheduled to meet at the Group of 7 summit in Kananaskis, Alberta, earlier this month before Trump abruptly cut his trip short and returned to Washington.Rutte has stressed before that Trump's tariff war has no impact on since the alliance doesn't deal with trade. But it will be hard to ignore the issue as the US and the European Union continue to negotiate a trade deal after the US president threatened 50 percent import taxes on all European goods.Trump has set a July 9 deadline for the US and the 27-country EU to strike a trade deal. But in recent days, he's said the EU had not offered a fair deal as he reiterated his threat to force Europe to ""just pay whatever we say they have to pay.""",President Donald Trump's first appearance at since returning to the White House was supposed to centre on how the US secured a historic military spending pledge from others.

Iran late Monday launched a retaliatory strike against US forces stationed at Qatar’s Al Udeid Airbase, America’s largest military installation in the Middle East, responding to a recent US attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.Loud explosions were reported across Doha and Lusail, with missiles seen streaking across the night sky. In the immediate aftermath, Qatar shut down its airspace as a precaution.A video from a Doha shopping mall showed scenes of panic, with people, including women and children, rushing to safety amid the chaos.Iran's Supreme National Security Council stated that its military used the same number of bombs as the US did in its strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Tehran claimed it deliberately targeted areas away from Qatar's urban centers, stressing that the operation posed no threat to its ""friendly and brotherly"" neighbour.The missile barrage, dubbed ""Annunciation of Victory"" by Iran’s Tasnim news agency, was part of a wider retaliation that also included strikes on US bases in Iraq, according to a security source cited by the Associated Press.The latest escalation followed Israeli strikes under Operation Rising Lion, which targeted Iran’s key nuclear facilities in Natanz. The US later joined the offensive, hitting three major sites: Natanz, Fordow, and Isfahan.However, US President Donald Trump later announced a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran.","Iran launches missile barrage against US forces stationed at Qatar’s Al Udeid Airbase.

A powerful earthquake measuring 6.2 magnitude has jolted parts of southern Philippines on Tuesday.The shallow quake struck about 374 kilometres (232 miles) east of the island of Davao. There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage.In a post on X, the National Center for Seismology posted the details of earthquake on X. It said, ""EQ of M: 6.2, On: 24/06/2025 07:28:06 IST, Lat: 7.90 N, Long: 130.09 E, Depth: 10 Km, Location: East of Philippine Islands.""T he Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, which reported the earthquake also cleared that no tsunami alert had been issued.Philippines is located on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"", an arc of intense seismic activity that stretches from Japan through Southeast Asia and across the Pacific basin. The quakes are a near-daily occurrence in the country.The earthquakes of low intensity are too weak to be felt by humans, however strong and destructive quakes are difficult to predict and where they might strike.The last major quake was recorded in July 2022. It was a magnitude 7 tremor that triggered landslides and ground fissures in the northern province of Abra, killing at least 11 people and injuring 609 others.","The shallow quake struck about 374 kilometres (232 miles) east of the island of Davao.

In a fresh development in the Iran-Israel conflict, Iran on late Monday fired a barrage of missiles at the US-operated Al Udeid air base in Qatar. The attack was Tehran's retaliation to American strikes on it's three key nuclear facilities on Sunday.Residents in Doha and nearby Lusail reported hearing thunderous explosions as the night sky was pierced by projectile trails and interception flashes.Video captured the moment air defenses were deployed to intercept missiles in the skies above Doha. The footage showed the missiles illuminating the night as the air defense systems neutralised the threat.US President Donald Trump downplayed the Iranian attack, calling it a ‘weak response’.“Iran has officially responded to our Obliteration of their Nuclear Facilities with a very weak response, which we expected, and have very effectively countered,” he said. “There have been 14 missiles fired — 13 were knocked down, and 1 was ‘set free,’ because it was headed in a nonthreatening direction.”Amid the rising tension, Trump also made a surprise announcement declaring a 'complete and total ceasefire' between Israel and Iran.He gave out the details on the phased de-escalation over the next 24 hours.Calling the recent conflict the “12-day War,” Trump posted on Truth Social, ""CONGRATULATIONS TO EVERYONE!

In a dramatic turn during the twelfth day of the Iran-Israel conflict, US President Donald Trump announced that a complete ceasefire had been agreed upon between the two warring nations. However, within minutes, Iran firmly denied any such deal and stated that there is no agreement as of now.Meanwhile, Israeli emergency service Magen David Adom (MDA) confirmed that three people were killed in an Iranian missile strike on southern Israel, marking the first reported deaths in Israel since Trump’s ceasefire announcement.Donald Trump took to Truth Social to declare an end to the conflict, stating that Israel and Iran had both agreed to a ceasefire. He described the 12-day war as one that could have “destroyed the entire Middle East” but was instead coming to a peaceful close.“There will be a Complete and Total CEASEFIRE (in approximately 6 hours from now, when Israel and Iran have wound down and completed their in progress, final missions!), for 12 hours, at which point the War will be considered, ENDED!”“God bless Israel, God bless Iran, God bless the Middle East, God bless the United States of America, and GOD BLESS THE WORLD!”Just after Trump’s post, Iran’s foreign minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi released a statement saying that no ceasefire had been agreed to.He maintained that Iran had been defending itself and set conditions for halting operations.“As Iran has repeatedly made clear: Israel launched war on Iran, not the other way around.”“As of now, there is NO ‘agreement’ on any ceasefire or cessation of military operations. However, provided that the Israeli regime stops its illegal aggression against the Iranian people no later than 4 am Tehran time, we have no intention to continue our response afterwards.”“The final decision on the cessation of our military operations will be made later.”A second post by Araghchi followed shortly, confirming that Iran’s military actions had stopped as of 4am, while praising the Iranian Armed Forces.“The military operations of our powerful Armed Forces to punish Israel for its aggression continued until the very last minute, at 4am.”“Together with all Iranians, I thank our brave Armed Forces who remain ready to defend our dear country until their last drop of blood, and who responded to any attack by the enemy until the very last minute.”Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei shared a strong message online, saying that Iran will not back down and showed that the country remains strong and determined.“Those who know the Iranian people and their history know that the Iranian nation isn’t a nation that surrenders.”Hours before the ceasefire talk, Iran launched missiles at the US-operated Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. Loud explosions were heard across Doha and Lusail. Iran said this was in retaliation for US bombing of its nuclear facilities. Qatar condemned the strike and claimed nearly all missiles were intercepted.Iranian media called it “a mighty and successful response by the armed forces of Iran to America’s aggression.”These strikes came in response to the US' Operation Midnight Hammer, which targeted Iran's three major nuclear sites: Fordow, Isfahan, and Natanz. The US used B-2 bombers and 30,000-pound bunker-buster ammunition to carry out the operation.Also read: Iran launches missiles at US base in Qatar; explosions rock Doha, Indian embassy urges caution - top developments Trump downplayed Iran’s missile strike on the base in Qatar, saying most of the missiles were intercepted and that no Americans were hurt.

Regarding the attack today at the American Base in Qatar, I am pleased to report that, in addition to no Americans being killed or wounded, very importantly, there have also been no Qataris killed or wounded.”In another post, Trump criticised Russian former President Dmitry Medvedev for allegedly mentioning nuclear warheads being sent to Iran. Trump expressed alarm over the use of the word “nuclear.”“Did I hear Former President Medvedev, from Russia, casually throwing around the ‘N word’ (Nuclear!), and saying that he and other Countries would supply Nuclear Warheads to Iran? Did he really say that or, is it just a figment of my imagination?

WASHINGTON: A federal judge on Monday blocked another effort by the Trump administration to keep international students from attending Harvard University, saying officials' ""misplaced efforts to control a reputable academic institution"" threatened freedom of speech.The order from US District Judge Allison Burroughs in Boston preserves the ability of foreign students to travel to the US for study at Harvard while the case is decided.President Donald Trump has sought to cut off Harvard's enrollment of foreign students as part of a pressure campaign seeking changes to governance and policies at the Ivy League school. Administration officials also have cut more than $2.6 billion in research grants, ended federal contracts and threatened to revoke the tax-exempt status for the school Trump has derided as a hotbed of liberalism.Harvard sued the department of homeland security in May after the agency withdrew the school's certification to host foreign students and issue paperwork for their visas. The action would have forced Harvard's roughly 7,000 foreign students to transfer or risk being in the US illegally.The university called it illegal retaliation for rejecting the White House's demands to overhaul Harvard policies around campus protests, admissions, hiring and other issues.Burroughs temporarily had halted the action hours after Harvard sued and then granted an initial injunction Friday.The latest injunction came Monday in response to another move from Trump, who cited a different legal justification when he issued a June 4 proclamation blocking foreign students from entering the US to attend Harvard.In her order, Burroughs said the case is about freedom of speech and freedom of thought.""Here, the government's misplaced efforts to control a reputable academic institution and squelch diverse viewpoints seemingly because they are, in some instances, opposed to this administration's own views, threaten these rights,"" she wrote.Trump has been warring with Harvard for months after it rejected a series of government demands meant to address conservative complaints that the school has become too liberal and tolerated anti-Jewish harassment.On Friday, he said in a post on Truth Social that the administration has been working with Harvard to address ""their large-scale improprieties"" and that a deal with Harvard could be announced within the next week. ""They have acted extremely appropriately during these negotiations, and appear to be committed to doing what is right,"" Trump's post said.Foreign students, who account for a quarter of Harvard's enrollment, were brought into the battle in April when Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem demanded Harvard turn over a trove of records related to any dangerous or illegal activity by foreign students. Harvard says it complied, but Noem said the response fell short and on May 22 revoked Harvard's certification in the student and exchange visitor program.The sanction immediately put Harvard at a disadvantage as it competed for the world's top students, the school said in its lawsuit. ""Without its international students, Harvard is not Harvard,"" the suit said.Harvard President Alan Garber previously said the university has made changes to combat antisemitism. But Harvard, he said, will not stray from its ""core, legally-protected principles,"" even after receiving federal ultimatums.",A federal judge on Monday blocked another effort by the Trump administration to keep international students from attending Harvard University.

China tightens fentanyl controls in goodwill gesture to US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/china-tightens-fentanyl-controls-in-goodwill-gesture-to-us/articleshow/122037588.cms,"



China moved to tighten controls over two chemicals that can be used to make fentanyl, in an apparent olive branch to the US that may help maintain their fragile trade truce.Authorities added two previously unclassified precursors to a list of Class Two chemicals, according to a joint statement by six govt departments on Monday.The label will subject the substances, 4-piperidone and 1-boc-4-piperidone, to tougher supervision starting July 20. One of the chemicals, 4-piperidone, is regulated in the US as a precursor to fentanyl. The other substance, 1-boc-4-piperidone, can be used to make a precursor for the narcotic.The announcement followed a meeting between China's minister of public security Wang Xiaohong and US Ambassador David Perdue in Beijing last week. Wang said China was ready to collaborate on law enforcement areas such as counter-narcotics, which has been a source of friction between the world's largest economies.Beijing's gesture comes after recent trade talks led to a suspension of drastic tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese goods. But 20% levies tied to fentanyl have remained, making products from China less competitive and contributing to a drop in exports to the US. Cracking down on precursors is one of the few obvious avenues China has that may reduce those charges.","Authorities added two previously unclassified precursors to a list of Class Two chemicals.

Harvard Defiant Despite Trump Visa Ban, Vows To Protect Global Students | 'Illegal Retaliation'

Implications for international students





A federal judge on Monday issued a second preliminary injunction against the Trump administration’s ongoing efforts to prevent international students from attending Harvard University.US district judge Allison Burroughs in Boston ruled in favour of Harvard, allowing foreign students to continue traveling to the US for their studies while the case moves forward. This follows an earlier injunction issued last Friday, also in response to federal action against the university.“This case is about core constitutional rights that must be safeguarded: freedom of thought, freedom of expression, and freedom of speech, each of which is a pillar of a functioning democracy and an essential hedge against authoritarianism,” she said in a statement.US President Donald Trump has been pressuring Harvard to change its policies, criticising the institution as overly liberal. His administration has cut more than $2.6 billion in research funding, ended federal contracts, and threatened to revoke Harvard’s tax-exempt status.In a Truth Social post last week, Trump said the administration was negotiating with Harvard and hinted at a possible agreement, saying that the university had acted “appropriately” during the talks.However, Harvard president Alan Garber has said the school will not compromise its “core, legally-protected principles,” despite pressure from Washington.Despite the federal court's ruling in favor of Harvard, many international students continue to face difficulties entering the US. Students have reported issues at airports and consulates, where federal officers have followed outdated or inconsistent guidance, resulting in denied visas or entry refusals, even after the injunction was issued.Harvard, which has around 7,000 international students, said the federal actions had already caused “profound fear, concern, and confusion.” Many students have considered transferring due to the uncertainty surrounding their visa status.Maureen Martin, director of Harvard’s immigration services, confirmed that numerous students were left in limbo. The university argued that losing its international student body would harm its academic mission and global standing. “Without its international students, Harvard is not Harvard,” the lawsuit stated.In response, Harvard is developing contingency plans to ensure affected students can continue their education, regardless of ongoing legal or policy changes.For students making major life decisions, such as booking flights, signing leases, or leaving jobs in their home countries, the lack of clarity has been especially disruptive.The dispute began in May when the department of homeland security withdrew Harvard’s certification to host foreign students, which would have forced them to leave or remain in the US without legal status. Harvard sued, claiming the move was retaliation for rejecting federal demands to alter its policies on admissions, campus protests, and hiring.Monday’s injunction also blocks a separate proclamation issued by Trump on June 4, which attempted to use a different legal basis to bar international students. Judge Burroughs had first paused that action with a temporary restraining order before issuing this new ruling.","US district judge Allison Burroughs in Boston ruled in favour of Harvard, allowing foreign students to continue traveling to the US for their studies.

Israel-Iran conflict: Satellite images suggest US avoided hitting nuclear reactors at key facility,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/israel-iran-conflict-satellite-images-suggest-us-avoided-hitting-nuclear-reactors-at-key-facility/articleshow/122035895.cms,"



For all of the destruction the US Air Force visited on Iran's nuclear programme, satellite images show that military planners were careful not to hit reactors at a key research facility.Notably absent from the latest International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) damage report are three research reactors operating at the Isfahan Nuclear Technology and Research Center. One of the so-called miniature neutron source reactors, made by China in 1991, runs on 900 grams (2 pounds) of bomb-grade uranium.American officials said at the weekend that an assessment of the final damage from Trump's decision to join Israel in attacking Iran will take some time. But as more images emerge, the Isfahan sites appear to have been intentionally left untouched, according to four senior officials in Vienna. They asked not to be identified in exchange for discussing sensitive information.The IAEA's board of governors convened an emergency session on Monday in the Austrian capital to discuss the ongoing strikes against Iran's nuclear programme. Hitting an operational nuclear reactor, even if low powered like the ones at Isfahan, could set a grave precedent, the officials said.Agency inspectors demanded that Iran inform them about the current location of its highly enriched uranium stockpile. Iran warned the attacks have gravely damaged international diplomatic efforts to halt the spread of atomic weapons.","Satellite images show that military planners were careful not to hit reactors at a key research facility.

In a tense and unprecedented moment during a live broadcast, veteran CNN anchor Anderson Cooper , along with correspondents Clarissa Ward and Jeremy Diamond, were compelled to urgently evacuate their Tel Aviv hotel studio amid a missile alert triggered by an Iranian attackThey were discussing the escalating Israel‑Iran crisis around 3 a.m. local time when air‑raid sirens began sounding, accompanied by smartphone alerts warning of an impending missile strike. Ward informed viewers: “I should just say that we’re now hearing an alert.” Cooper explained, “These are the alerts… It’s a 10‑minute warning of incoming missiles or something incoming from Iran.”With less than ten minutes before impact, the team swiftly began moving guests and equipment into the hotel’s bomb shelter. Cooper, visibly rattled, reassured viewers of their intention to continue broadcasting, “even if we can, on the way down.” A brief technical glitch ensued as they descended, but the live feed resumed with distance shots and sirens blaring in the background.“It is a luxury to have a 10‑minute warning,” Cooper remarked once in the shelter, highlighting Israel’s early warning system.This incident unfolded amid an intense military exchange between Iran and Israel. The alert followed reportedly more than 40 missiles launched from Iran in retaliation to recent US strikes on Iranian nuclear installations, with at least 23 people injured and extensive infrastructural damage reported in several Israeli citiesAnderson Cooper was mocked by President Donald Trump Monday as he called him Allison Cooper when he called out fake news for not emphasizing how successful Operation Midnight Hammer was.""The sites that we hit in Iran were totally destroyed, and everyone knows it.

Former Pakistan foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari issued a blunt warning Monday to India over its unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), saying Pakistan would not hesitate to respond if its water rights were violated. Speaking during the budget session of National Assembly, the Pakistan Peoples Party chairman said, “India has two options: share water fairly, or we will take it from all six rivers. ” He described India’s move to suspend the 1960 treaty after the terrorist attack in Pahalgam as both illegal and provocative.Bilawal argued there is no clause allowing unilateral withdrawal. “India’s claim that the treaty is in abeyance has no legal basis. According to the UN Charter, cutting off water is a form of aggression,” he said. He warned that if India pursued this course, it could lead to open conflict.“We do not want war, but if water is used as a weapon... Pakistan will be forced to act — and we are in a position to defeat India just as we have before,” he said.Bilawal urged India to resume dialogue, particularly on counterterrorism coordination. “Without engagement, violence will increase in both countries,” he warned, adding Pakistan’s own fight against terrorism had been undermined by Indian attempts to “politicise the issue”.",Bilawal Bhutto Zardari warns India over its unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan on Monday extended its airspace ban on Indian aircraft for another month, citing ongoing tensions between the two countries following the Pahalgam terrorist attack and subsequent military operations.The ban, originally imposed on April 23, was first extended on May 23 after India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7. The Indian military action targeted and reportedly dismantled several terror camps in Pakistan-administered territory, triggering four days of intense cross-border clashes that concluded with a ceasefire on May 10.A fresh Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) issued by the Pakistan Airports Authority now extends the restriction from June 23 to July 23. The notice states, “Pakistan airspace not available for Indian registered aircraft and aircraft operated/owned or leased by Indian airlines/operators including military flights.”The situation remains tense despite the end of direct hostilities. Diplomatic channels have yet to yield any breakthroughs in repairing the fractured bilateral relationship. Indian and Pakistani officials have not resumed formal dialogue since the flare-up.The initial ban followed the Pahalgam terrorist attack, which killed at least 26 people, further deepening mistrust and heightening military alertness on both sides.","The ban, originally imposed on April 23, was first extended on May 23 after India launched Operation Sindoor.

Pakistan Condemns U.S. Strikes On Iran A Day After Nobel Peace Prize Endorsement For Donald Trump





The Pakistani government and its powerful military establishment are facing a wave of public backlash after formally recommending US President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, a move that drew widespread condemnation following the US airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities.Pakistan’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar sent a letter to the Nobel Committee in Norway, crediting Trump’s “decisive diplomatic intervention” during the recent India-Pakistan standoff. But the recommendation triggered a storm on social media after Trump ordered attacks on Iran’s Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan nuclear sites, an operation he called a “historic moment” and one that escalated regional tensions.On X (formerly Twitter), users accused the Pakistani government of appeasing its “master.” One user mocked, “Pakistanis, beware! After the attack on Iran, PM Shehbaz might not only award Trump the Nobel Peace Prize, but also Tamgha-e-Jurat, Tamgha-e-Shujaat, Tamgha-e-Basalat, Tamgha-e-Imtiaz, and perhaps even the Nishan-e-Haider!”Veteran journalist Ameer Abbas recalled that PML-N leader Khawaja Saad Rafique had once likened Trump to Genghis Khan and Hitler.“Now, the same government nominates him for the Nobel Peace Prize. Who is orchestrating such shameful and cowardly decisions?” he asked.Raheeq Abbasi, political analyst and columnist, noted the irony, “Trump, who vetoed the Gaza ceasefire 8 times and is protested across the West for war crimes, is being nominated for a Nobel by the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Is there no sense of honour left?”The backlash cut across ideological lines. Some users accused the military establishment of calling the shots. “The uncrowned kings are ready to sell out the nation whenever they please,” wrote Major (R) Asim.Another user, Jarjees Ahmad, called out the “supreme level of hypocrisy”, “We’re nominating someone involved in the massacre of Palestinians while claiming to stand with Iran.”Aamir Khan added, “What greater betrayal could there be to Muslims, our country, and the people of Pakistan?”The Pakistani government has yet to respond officially to the criticism.","Pakistan's deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar sent a letter to the Nobel Committee in Norway, crediting Trump’s “decisive diplomatic intervention” during the recent India-Pakistan standoff.

Poll Do you agree with Pakistan's decision to nominate Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize? Yes No





ISLAMABAD: In a move likely to stir diplomatic discussion across the region, the Shehbaz Sharif-led Pakistan govt announced on Saturday that it will formally recommend US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize, citing his diplomatic intervention during the recent India-Pakistan military crisis, reports Omer Farooq Khan.In an official statement shared on X, the Pakistan govt credited Trump's ""decisive intervention"" and ""pivotal leadership"" with helping de-escalate a rapidly intensifying standoff between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.Islamabad said it responded with a calibrated military action - Operation Bunyanum Marsoos - described as a ""measured"" and ""precise"" strike intended to restore deterrence without targeting civilian areas.Pakistan's govt claimed Trump engaged both Islamabad and New Delhi through high-level diplomacy at a moment of heightened regional volatility, securing a ceasefire that averted a wider conflagration. ""President Trump demonstrated strategic foresight and statesmanship, preventing a broader conflict that could have had catastrophic consequences for the region,"" the statement read.The govt also praised Trump for his ""sincere"" willingness to assist in resolving the Kashmir dispute - an issue Pakistan maintains is central to lasting peace in South Asia.India, however, has consistently rejected third-party involvement in Kashmir, reiterating that the issue must be resolved bilaterally under the Simla Agreement.The Pakistani statement expressed hope that Trump's ""legacy of pragmatic diplomacy"" would continue to play a role in addressing global flashpoints, including the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and rising tensions involving Iran.Trump, who is yet to respond publicly, has previously highlighted his role in managing past India-Pakistan tensions, including in 2019 following the Pulwama-Balakot incident. His earlier offer to mediate on Kashmir was firmly rebuffed by New Delhi.The Nobel Peace Prize nomination process permits formal recommendations from heads of state, national lawmakers, and certain academic and diplomatic figures. The Norwegian Nobel Committee does not comment on individual nominations.If successful, Trump would join a select group of American leaders - US Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Jimmy Carter, and Barack Obama - who have received the Nobel Peace Prize.","Pakistan to nominate US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize.
