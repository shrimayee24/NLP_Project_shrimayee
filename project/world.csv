JAISALMER: Peace was what I wanted to pray for when I was looking to join my family Thursday at Chundhi GaneshTemple, 12km from Jaisalmer. Not long after that, though, I was caught in a crossfire - of blasts, gunfire and chaos. Anything but peace.That was how the evening unfolded for me in this Rajasthan border city, engulfed in terror of Pakistani drone attacks near the high-security Pokhran area.My family was already at the temple, having gone there around 7pm. I set out to join them later and had just reached Hanuman Chowk, some distance from my home, around 9pm when I was halted by a hail of deafening blasts overhead, followed by the unmistakable rat-a-tat of gunfire. I pulled over and looked skyward, my heart pounding as multiple explosions shattered the air. Our anti-drone defence systems sprang into action, their rapid fire piercing the darkness as they attempted to neutralise the threats.My thoughts turned to my family. Matters got worse as I learned my son Harshad was on a bus to Jaipur, now caught in the middle of the crisis.Word about the drones spread like wildfire. So did panic. Youths took positions at major intersections, forcing vehicles to turn off lights and threatening those who didn't comply with sticks. Their actions, though aggressive, were driven by the need to protect the city from Pakistani projectiles. The next few hours were frenetic. My family left for home but faced renewed drone attacks around 10pm. This forced them to take shelter at Amarsagar Jain Temple.Heavy rain added to their ordeal. When they tried to return again, they were stopped by police at Moomal Chowk, on the outskirts. This was a frustrating, but necessary, security drill. They later made their way to a restaurant where they waited till 1am (Friday) till it was safe to cover the rest of the way home.In the meantime, I had my son get off the bus at Khetolai, 80km from Jaisalmer, and organised overnight accommodation for him in a village. It wasn't until 2am that my family made it home in Jaisalmer.As a journalist, I am battle-hardened, having covered many challenging situations. But Thursday offered a reality check. My own family was in peril. The Pakistani fusillade has left me deeply shaken. This night will remain etched in memory.","My family was already at the temple, having gone there around 7pm.

The growing controversy behind Jordon Hudson’s banishment







Family fears growing fallout from Hudson controversy



In a shocking development, Jordon Hudson , the 24-year-old girlfriend of NFL coaching legend Bill Belichick , has been banned from the University of North Carolina ’s football facility. This unexpected move, reportedly made by UNC’s top officials last week, marks a significant shift in how the university views Hudson’s involvement with the program. Sources indicate that Hudson is no longer allowed in the football building or on the field, raising serious questions about her influence and the consequences of her controversial public appearances.The decision to expel Hudson from the UNC facility comes amid rising controversy following her involvement in a widely publicized CBS book-tour interview. Sports media expert Pablo Torre suggests that this move could signal the end of Hudson's public involvement with the university and the football team. Once a minor curiosity, Hudson’s presence has now become a major source of debate and concern. It remains unclear whether UNC is distancing itself from Hudson to protect Belichick’s image or to avoid further scandal, Hudson’s visibility in the football world is quickly diminishing.Despite the ban, Hudson has not backed down. In a move that many see as defiance, she retweeted a message that casts doubt on the reports of her expulsion. The tweet suggests a larger conspiracy to discredit both Hudson and Belichick, adding more fuel to the fire of the growing drama. Whether Hudson believes she’s been unfairly targeted or simply rejects the idea that her removal was necessary remains unclear, but the controversy surrounding her continues to swirl.Reports indicate that Belichick’s family is deeply concerned about the impact this controversy could have on his decades-long legacy. The idea that Hudson’s actions could damage both Belichick and the University of North Carolina’s football program has sparked intense worry within his circle. As the drama intensifies, it’s becoming evident that this situation could have serious repercussions for both Belichick’s career and UNC’s reputation.Also Read: Giants skip Shedeur Sanders in NFL Draft after tense meeting in move that raises eyebrows The situation is on the verge of either dying down or escalating into a larger scandal. With the stakes so high, it’s hard to imagine that this issue will remain quiet for long. If things worsen, the fallout could leave a lasting impact on both UNC’s football program and Bill Belichick’s storied career in the NFL. Given Belichick’s status as a legendary NFL coach and UNC’s standing in college football, any further developments could draw national headlines, trigger institutional consequences, and potentially reshape public perception for years to come.","Jordon Hudson, the 24-year-old girlfriend of NFL coaching legend Bill Belichick, has been banned from the University of North Carolina ’s football facility.

CHANDIGARH: A widespread blackout was enforced across several districts of Punjab, Chandigarh, and Haryana’s Panchkula Ambala and Sirsa districts on Thursday night as tensions flared between India and Pakistan following Operation Sindoor and the threat of air strikes.Authorities ordered residents to switch off lights and stay indoors, accompanied by sirens and announcements from the police.Amritsar, Ferozepur, Tarn Taran, Gurdaspur, Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Hoshiarpur, Mohali, and Faridkot districts were subject to blackout orders. In Pathankot, the blackout began at 8.30 pm, coinciding with reports of air raid warnings. Gurdaspur’s blackout started at 9 pm and was extended until further notice.Key facilities like hospitals and the central jail were exempt but were instructed to keep windows closed.Mock drills were conducted in Kapurthala and Phagwara as a precautionary measure. Hospitals in border areas were directed to ensure continuous power supply, maintain sufficient water and fuel reserves, and have backup generators ready.Around 10.30 pm, explosions were reported in Bathinda following sightings of fireballs in the sky.Three to four explosions were heard in quick succession. The administration enforced an immediate blackout and urged residents to remain indoors. Bathinda’s SSP Amneet Kondal, confirmed one explosion near the National Fertilizers Limited (NFL) and stated that the armed forces were investigating.In the same period, an attempted attack near Uchi Bassi village, near Mukerian, was neutralised.

The district administration attributed the blasts to possible sonic booms, but residents were left shaken The local administration offered only a brief statement that “Amritsar is safe”, while assuring residents that precautionary measures were in place. Deputy commissioner Sakshi Sawhney said, “We are observing precaution, there is no need to panic. ”The city experienced two blackouts. Police commissioner Gurpreet Bhullar clarified that the blackouts were a temporary measure prompted by the loud noises.By Thursday morning, reports surfaced of missile debris scattered across four villages of Makhanwindi, Jethuwal, Pandher, and Dudhala.

SAN FRANCISCO: The Republican administration must halt much of its dramatic downsizing of the federal workforce, a California judge ordered Friday.Judge Susan Illston in San Francisco issued the emergency order in a lawsuit filed by labor unions and cities last week, one of multiple legal challenges to Republican President Donald Trump's efforts to shrink the size of a federal government he calls bloated and expensive.""The Court holds the President likely must request Congressional cooperation to order the changes he seeks, and thus issues a temporary restraining order to pause large-scale reductions in force in the meantime,"" Illston wrote in her order.The temporary restraining order directs numerous federal agencies to halt acting on the president's workforce executive order signed in February and a subsequent memo issued by the department of government Efficiency and the Office of personnel management.The order, which expires in 14 days, does not require departments to rehire people. Plaintiffs asked that the effective date of any agency action be postponed and that departments stop implementing or enforcing the executive order, including taking any further action.They limited their request to departments where dismantlement is already underway or poised to be underway, including at the the US Department of health and human services, which announced in March it will lay off 10,000 workers and centralize divisions.Illston, who was nominated to the bench by former President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, said at a hearing Friday the president has authority to seek changes in the executive branch departments and agencies created by Congress.""But he must do so in lawful ways,"" she said. ""He must do so with the cooperation of Congress, the Constitution is structured that way.""Trump has repeatedly said voters gave him a mandate to remake the federal government, and he tapped billionaire Elon Musk to lead the charge through DOGE.Tens of thousands of federal workers have been fired, left their jobs via deferred resignation programs or have been placed on leave as a result of Trump's government-shrinking efforts. There is no official figure for the job cuts, but at least 75,000 federal employees took deferred resignation, and thousands of probationary workers have already been let go.Lawyers for the government argued Friday that the executive order and memo calling for large-scale personnel reductions and reorganization plans provided only general principles that agencies should follow in exercising their own decision-making process.""It expressly invites comments and proposals for legislative engagement as part of policies that those agencies wish to implement,"" Eric Hamilton, a deputy assistant attorney general, said of the memo. ""It is setting out guidance.""But Danielle Leonard, an attorney for plaintiffs, said it was clear that the president, DOGE and OPM were making decisions outside of their authority and not inviting dialogue from agencies.""They are not waiting for these planning documents"" to go through long processes, she said. ""They're not asking for approval, and they're not waiting for it.""The temporary restraining order applies to departments including the departments of Agriculture, Energy, Labor, Interior, State, Treasury and Veteran Affairs.It also applies to the national science foundation, small business association, social security administration and Environmental Protection Agency.Some of the labor unions and nonprofit groups are also plaintiffs in another lawsuit before a San Francisco judge challenging the mass firings of probationary workers. In that case, Judge William Alsup ordered the government in March to reinstate those workers, but the U.S. Supreme Court later blocked his order.Plaintiffs include the cities of San Francisco, Chicago and Baltimore; labor group American Federation of Government Employees; and nonprofit groups alliance for retired Americans, center for taxpayer rights and coalition to protect america's national parks.","Judge Susan Illston in San Francisco issued the emergency order in a lawsuit filed by labor unions and cities.

President Trump said the US would impose sanctions on Russia if it did not accept an extended cease-fire in its war with Ukraine, writing on social media after a phone call late Thursday with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy.The remark was another swivel by the administration closer to Ukraine's positions in cease-fire talks, after two months of concessions to Russia, including broadening diplomatic relations and voting against a UN resolution condemning Moscow for the war.During talks in March, Trump govt had proposed a 30-day truce to allow for peace negotiations. Ukraine accepted the idea but Russia has pushed instead for negotiating terms for a settlement before accepting a cease-fire.After a meeting with Zelenskyy last month, Trump threatened Russia with sanctions if it drew out of the negotiations. But his latest post was his clearest statement yet that he was linking additional US sanctions to its acceptance of a 30-day truce for talks. ""If the ceasefire is not respected, the US and its partners will impose further sanctions."" The US, Trump wrote, ""calls for, ideally, a 30-day unconditional ceasefire."".Zelenskyy's office said the two leaders congratulated one another on the anniversary of end of WWII in Europe.Zelenskyy quickly welcomed Trump's endorsement of a ceasefire. ""Ukraine is ready for a full ceasefire starting right now, from this very moment"". Ukraine had rejected a Russian offer of a three-day truce around Victory Day holiday and parade in Moscow Friday, which was attended by two dozen world leaders, including China's Xi Jinping. He said the proposal allowed too little time to negotiate an agreement and it was offered only to put guests of the Moscow parade at ease.In the days before the parade, Russia and Ukraine launched volleys of drones toward the countries' capitals, disrupting flights near Moscow and killing two people and starting fires in Kyiv. The attacks halted after the start of Russia's proposed truce but fighting along the front line carried on. In a move sure to enrage Ukraine, Russia unveiled a bust of Stalin, adorned with red carnations, as part of Victory Day celebrations in occupied Ukraine city of Mariupol. Stalin is a reviled figure in Ukraine for 1930s famine that killed millions.","President Trump said the US would impose sanctions on Russia if it did not accept an extended cease-fire in its war with Ukraine.

MONTGOMERY : An Iranian mechanical engineering student at University of Alabama has decided to self-deport after six weeks in a Louisiana detention centre despite govt dropping a charge behind his initial arrest, his lawyer and fiancee said. Alireza Doroudi was detained by immigration officials in March and has been held at a facility in Louisiana, over 300 miles from where he lived with his fiancee in Alabama. At the time, the state department said Doroudi posed ""significant national security concerns."" Doroudi's lawyer, David Rozas, said govt hasn't offered evidence to support the claim. Doroudi's visa was revoked in June 2023. Officials did not give a reason and ignored numerous inquiries, his fiancee, Sama Ebrahimi Bajgani , said.The university told Doroudi he was legally allowed to stay but would not be allowed to re-enter if he left. This spring, govt filed two charges against Doroudi to justify deporting him, saying his visa was revoked and he was not ""in status"" as a student, Rozas said.On Thursday, a govt attorney withdrew the first of those and said the visa revocation was ""prudential"", meaning it would not go into effect until after he leaves the country. A state department spokesperson declined to comment on the case, including Rozas' characterisation of the initial arrest as an error.The judge in the case gave both sides until the end of May to refile motions and denied Doroudi's plea to redetermine eligibility for bond. Doroudi decided to give up rather than continue to fight deportation.""He told me if they let him go out, there was a good chance he would have fought his case for the sake of other students and for the sake of himself,"" Bajgani said. She echoed Rozas' confusion about why Doroudi was targeted, saying he had no criminal record, entered the US legally and was not politically outspoken like others who have been targeted.","Alireza Doroudi was detained by immigration officials in March.

Robert Francis Prevost, the Chicago-born cardinal selected on Thursday as the new pope, is descended from Creole people of colour from New Orleans.The pope's maternal grandparents, both of whom are described as Black or mulatto in various historical records, lived in the city's Seventh Ward, an area that is traditionally Catholic and a melting pot of people with African, Caribbean and European roots.The grandparents, Joseph Martinez and Louise Baquie, eventually moved to Chicago in the early 20th century and had a daughter: Mildred Martinez, the pope's mother.The discovery means that Leo XIV, as the pope will be known, is not only breaking ground as the first US-born pontiff. He also comes from a family that reflects the many threads that make up the complicated and rich fabric of the American story.The pope's background was unearthed on Thursday by a New Orleans genealogist, Jari C Honora, and confirmed to NYT by the pope's older brother, John Prevost, 71, who lives in the Chicago suburbs.""This discovery is just an additional reminder of how interwoven we are as Americans,"" Honora said in a text message late Thursday. ""I hope that it will highlight the long history of Black Catholics, both free and enslaved, in this country, which includes the Holy Father's family.""It's unclear whether the new pope has ever addressed his Creole ancestry in public, and his brother said that the family did not identify as Black. The announcement of his election in Rome focused on his early life in Chicago and decades of service in Peru.","Robert Francis Prevost, the Chicago-born cardinal selected on Thursday as the new pope, is descended from Creole people of colour from New Orleans.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday called a meeting of National Command Authority after India targeted at least four Pakistan air bases in response to Pakistan’s recent cross-border drone and missile attacks that targeted multiple Indian military and civilian locations.National Command Authority is Pakistan’s highest security decision-making body, comprising senior civilian and military leaders. It oversees key national security matters, including the country’s nuclear weapons policy and strategic planning.This comes after India destroyed key Pakistani posts and terrorist launch pads near Jammu, which were being used to launch tube-launched drones, news agency ANI reported citing sources.Earlier in the morning, multiple explosions were reported across several locations in Pakistan, indicating possible Indian punitive action in response to recent cross-border escalations.According to Pakistani claims, three of its air bases were targeted: Nur Khan Air Base in Rawalpindi, Murid Air Base in Chakwal, and Rafiqui Air Base in Jhang district of eastern Punjab province.The Indian retaliatory strikes come after a series of provocations from Pakistan, including a major drone offensive on strike, when 26 locations—from Jammu and Kashmir to Gujarat—were targeted using armed drones.Defence sources confirmed that Indian forces successfully thwarted these attacks, which were aimed at key infrastructure such as airports and air bases, for a second consecutive night.On Thursday night, Indian defence systems also intercepted and neutralized drones and missiles launched in an attempt to strike military installations in 15 northern and western Indian cities.The latest actions are part of a broader Indian military response under Operation Sindoor, which began on Wednesday.As part of that operation, Indian armed forces carried out precise missile strikes on nine terror targets in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) and Pakistan. The operation was launched in retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, which claimed the lives of 26 innocent civilians.","Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called a meeting of National Command Authority after India targeted at least four Pakistan air bases.

Donald Trump signs executive order allowing illegal immigrants to book 'free flights out of US',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-signs-executive-order-allowing-illegal-immigrants-to-book-free-flights-out-of-us/articleshow/121047054.cms,"(File photo)





Donald Trump has signed a new executive order launching what he called the “first ever self-deportation programme,” allowing undocumented immigrants to leave the United States at no cost, with flights booked via a new government-backed app.In a video posted on Truth Social, the president said: “Today I signed an executive order to launch the first ever self-deportation program for illegal aliens. We are making it as easy as possible for illegal aliens to leave America. Any illegal alien can simply show up at an airport and receive a free flight out of our country.”The announcement is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to push mass deportations through voluntary departures. The CBP Home app , allows migrants to “book a free flight to any foreign country,” Trump said, adding: “As long as it's not here, you can go anywhere you want.”In addition to free travel, Trump said the government would offer a financial bonus to encourage people to leave. “We're also adding a very important exit bonus for illegals to further incentivise their self-deportation. This deportation bonus will save American taxpayers billions and billions of dollars,” he claimed.Those who refuse to leave voluntarily were warned of strict penalties. “Illegal aliens who stay in America face punishments, including significant jail time, enormous financial penalties, confiscation of all property, garnishment of all wages, imprisonment and incarceration, and sudden deportation in a place and manner solely of our discretion,” Trump said.“Book your free flight right now. We want you out of America. ”This follows a recent announcement by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which is offering $1,000 payments to those who leave voluntarily and register through the CBP Home app. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem described the programme as a “safe and cost-effective way” to reduce illegal immigration without lengthy court processes.The administration says flights have already been booked for migrants returning to countries like Honduras. Officials argue that the policy will save money compared to traditional deportation methods, which cost over $17,000 per case.Critics, however, question whether migrants are truly benefiting from the scheme. Immigration advocates warn that those in legal proceedings may unknowingly abandon their cases and face long-term bans if they leave the country.Still, Trump insisted that “eventually, when the illegals are gone, it will save us trillions of dollars.”","Donald Trump has signed a new executive order launching what he called the ‘first ever self-deportation programme,’ allowing undocumented immigrants to leave the United States at no cost.

Watch: ICE agents drag mother away from baby during violent arrest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-ice-agents-drag-mother-away-from-baby-during-violent-arrest/articleshow/121047191.cms,"



A new video from Worcester, Massachusetts, has captured the violent arrest of a teenage girl by immigration officers, showing her face being slammed into the ground during a neighbourhood raid that has sparked public outrage and renewed scrutiny of ICE operations.The footage, filmed by witnesses and shared online, shows chaos erupting as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents attempted to detain a Brazilian woman who was with her newborn and teenage daughter. The dramatic events unfolded on Eureka Street late Thursday morning, as a crowd of about 25 residents formed a human barrier around the family in an attempt to block the arrest.Chants of “Don’t take the mother!” and “They don’t have a warrant!” rang out, with community members demanding to see official documentation from the agents.According to several onlookers, the ICE officers claimed they didn’t need to present a warrant, fuelling further unrest. By the time local police arrived, the mother had already been placed in an ICE vehicle. As tensions escalated, the woman’s 16-year-old daughter still holding her baby sibling stood in front of the vehicle in a desperate effort to stop it from leaving. She eventually handed the infant to a bystander before kicking the SUV.Police allege the girl attempted to jump in front of the vehicle. Moments later, officers tackled her to the ground. NBC Boston footage shows her being restrained with her face slammed into the pavement as she screamed. She was arrested on multiple charges including child endangerment and resisting arrest. The infant was unharmed.Another woman, Ashley Spring a candidate for the local school committee was also arrested after allegedly pushing officers and throwing an unknown liquid at them. She faces assault and disorderly conduct charges.City officials have since denounced the operation. City Manager Eric Batista described the incident as “harrowing,” while Mayor Joseph Petty called it “devastating” and said ICE had not informed city officials in advance.“The fear of ICE tearing a family apart is the worst nightmare of so many in our city,” Petty said.Worcester police maintain they were attempting to de-escalate the situation, but local leaders and immigrant rights advocates are demanding an investigation into both ICE and police conduct.","Video shows violent arrest of teenage girl by immigration officers.

The video was played during his killer’s sentencing in court, in a recreation of Pelkey’s own voice. In it, ‘Pelkey’ expressed forgiveness to the shooter





The letters came streaming in: from battalion brothers who had served alongside Christopher Pelkey in Iraq and Afghanistan, fellow missionaries and even a prom date. A niece and nephew addressed the court.Still, the voice that mattered the most to Pelkey's older sister, Stacey Wales, would most likely never be heard when it was time for an Arizona judge to sentence the man who killed her brother during a 2021 road rage episode - the victim's.Wales, 47, had a thought. What if her brother could speak for himself. And what would he tell Gabriel Horcasitas, 54, convicted of manslaughter? The answer came on May 1, when a likeness of her brother appeared on an 80-inch screen, the same one that had previously displayed autopsy photos of Pelkey and footage of his being fatally shot at an intersection in Arizona.It was created with AI.""It is a shame we encountered each other that day in those circumstances,"" the AI avatar said. ""In another life, we probably could have been friends. I believe in forgiveness and in God, who forgives. I always have and I still do."" While AI's use has spread through society, its use during the sentencing of Horcacitas, who got the maximum 10 and a half years in prison, appeared to be uncharted. Critics said the introduction of AI in legal proceedings could open the door to manipulation and deception.One thing was certain: The nearly four-minute video made a favourable impression on the judge. ""I loved that AI,"" judge Todd Lang said.""Thank you for that. And as angry as you are, and justifiably angry as the family is, I heard the forgiveness. And I know Horcasitas appreciated it, but so did I."" The video opened with a disclaimer. ""Hello, just to be clear, for everyone seeing this, I am a version of Chris Pelkey recreated through AI that uses my picture and voice profile... I was able to be digitally regenerated to share with you today.""Wales had been preparing her victim's impact statement for two years, but it was missing a critical element. ""I kept hearing what Chris would say."" She enlisted the help of her husband and their business partner, who had used AI to help corporate clients with presentations. They took Pelkey's voice from a video they had found of him speaking after completing treatment for PTSD at a facility for veterans. For his face and torso, they used a poster of Pelkey from a funeral service, digitally trimming his thick beard, removing his glasses and editing out a logo from his cap. Wales said she had written the script read by the AI likeness of her brother. ""I know AI can be used nefariously... But this was just another tool used to tell Chris's story."" A spokeswoman for county attorney said the office was not aware of AI being used. A defence lawyer said it would've been difficult to block the video from being shown. ""... However, this may be a situation where they just took it too far.""","Video created by AI to mimic likeness of Christopher Pelkey.

House homeland security Chairman Mark Green is pressing Tennessee authorities to hand over unredacted video and reports tied to a 2022 traffic stop involving Kilmar Abrego Garcia, reported the New York Post Garcia is a Salvadoran national wrongly deported to El Salvador in March under the Trump administration.Green’s request follows growing questions over the federal handling of Abrego Garcia’s case, which has become a flashpoint in debates over immigration and due process.Edited police bodycam footage, cited by Fox News, shows Abrego Garcia being pulled over by the Tennessee Highway Patrol while transporting eight other individuals in a van.A trooper is heard suggesting that Abrego Garcia was “hauling these people for money,” sparking suspicions of human trafficking. However, the 29-year-old was let go with a citation for driving with an expired license.A source cited by Fox said that redacted portions of the footage included troopers discussing whether to call immigration authorities. Though a call was made, federal agents reportedly did not respond at the scene.Abrego Garcia told officers he was driving to Temple Hills, Maryland, for construction work. It later emerged the vehicle’s owner, Jose Ramon Hernandez-Reyes, had been convicted in 2020 for migrant smuggling and allegedly employed Garcia multiple times to transport undocumented migrants. Hernandez-Reyes, currently in federal custody, told ABC News that he ran a smuggling “taxi service” and had hired Abrego Garcia frequently since 2015.Despite no charges from the stop, the Trump administration used the incident to portray Abrego Garcia as an MS-13 member However, his attorneys, including Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, deny any gang affiliation and highlight the lack of charges or criminal record. “There is no evidence of a crime in this footage,” Sandoval-Moshenberg was quoted as saying by CNN, insisting that Garcia’s deportation violated his right to due process.In 2019, a US immigration judge had ruled Garcia should not be deported to El Salvador, citing gang threats to his life. Nonetheless, he was mistakenly expelled in March and initially held in the CECOT megaprison.The Supreme Court has since upheld a lower court’s order for his return. Yet, Trump has refused to bring him back, citing alleged gang links.Green's letter also demands the names of FBI officials who declined to detain Garcia, saying the case reflects “reckless, open-borders policies” under the Biden-Harris administration.","House GOP chairman demands unredacted files in Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s case.

Mayor Eric Adams expressed interest in raising campaign donations from Turkish businessmen during a 2022 dinner, newly unsealed court documents in his dismissed corruption case have revealed.According to filings cited by the New York Post, Adams “welcomed the offer of foreign contributions” and directed a promoter to coordinate with one of his staffers to secure the funds for his 2025 re-election bid The revelations are part of a trove of 1,785 pages of court documents made public after a legal push by multiple media outlets. The documents detail the FBI’s wide-ranging investigation into Adams and offer insight into the evidence federal prosecutors were gathering before the case was abruptly dismissed in April.As per New York Post, the newly unsealed records show Adams attended the January 2022 dinner with two staffers, where the idea of a visit to Turkey to meet potential donors was discussed.The filing notes Adams encouraged further coordination to arrange the contributions, though the documents do not confirm whether the trip ever took place or any donations were received.The same set of filings also contains allegations that Adams misled federal investigators about the location of his personal cellphone, which was seized during a raid on Gracie Mansion in September 2024.The FBI recovered multiple devices from his residence, including two iPads, a second iPhone, and an Iridium satellite phone on his nightstand.In a sworn affidavit, an FBI agent accused the mayor of “evidence of consciousness of guilt,” alleging he intentionally hid his phone and made false statements because he feared the device could reveal evidence of other crimes. Adams reportedly told his lawyer he had forgotten the phone’s passcode and provided an incorrect one.The original five-count indictment against Adams, unsealed last September, accused him of accepting over $100,000 in undisclosed gifts and luxury travel in exchange for political favours. Prosecutors also alleged he pressured the FDNY to approve permits for the Turkish consulate building in Manhattan despite safety concerns.Adams was accused of using straw donor schemes to tap into millions in matching campaign funds, reported CBS News.Though Adams has denied all wrongdoing, the case led to significant fallout. Four deputy mayors and several federal prosecutors resigned following the controversial dismissal request, which Judge Dale Ho criticised as a political bargain, citing alleged concessions over immigration policy.Ho ultimately ruled the case would not return to court, describing the DOJ’s motion to dismiss as “smacking of a bargain” and saying it wasn’t fair to let the matter hang over the mayor during an election year.Despite the scandal, Adams met with US President Trump at the White House Friday to discuss what he called “key priorities” for New York City, even as questions around his conduct continue to linger.",New York Mayor Eric Adams was accused of accepting gifts and travel in exchange for political favours.
