Red Fort blast 'heinous terror incident': Centre,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/red-fort-blast-heinous-terror-incident-centre/articleshow/125288755.cms,"How Kashmir’s Jaish Posters Led To Delhi’s Red Fort Blast And Exposed A Nationwide Terror Network

NEW DELHI: The Union cabinet on Wednesday described Monday's car blast near Red Fort an act of ""terror"" in a description that signalled acknowledgement of the terrorists' plan to cause large-scale mayhem by striking multiple targets.""The country has witnessed a heinous terror incident, perpetrated by anti-national forces, through a car explosion near Red Fort on the evening of Nov 10, 2025. The explosion resulted in multiple fatalities, and caused injuries to several others,"" said the resolution adopted by the Union cabinet, which met soon after PM Narendra Modi's return from Thimphu and his visit to LNJP hospital to meet the victims of the blast carried out by a module comprising radicalised doctors and clerics.Though the case regarding the blast has been registered under the main anti-terror law, Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, and has been handed over to the National Investigation Agency , which is tasked with investigating terror incidents, the govt had until now not formally declared the blast a terror attack as such. The designation of ""terror incident"" is significant because of the anti-terror doctrine worked out by the Modi govt in the wake of the Pahalgam attack.As per the new policy, a terror attack, as the PM had spelt out in his address to the nation, is proposed to be treated and dealt with as an act of aggression against the country.Sources refrained from saying whether the blast on Monday fulfils the criterion and said a determination would be based on what the investigation across states might throw up. The cabinet, however, signalled its intent to use all options available to it against terror strikes. ""The cabinet reaffirms the govt's steadfast resolve to safeguard the lives and well-being of all Indians, consistent with its enduring commitment to national security and the safety of every citizen,"" it said.""The cabinet unequivocally condemns this dastardly and cowardly act that has led to the loss of innocent lives,"" it further said.The formal designation comes in the wake of mounting evidence that the ""Faridabad module"", increasingly being referred to as the ""white coat"" cell of terrorist organisation Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) because of the shocking alleged involvement of doctors, had multiple targets in different parts on their radar. The huge stockpile of explosives - enough to blow up a large shopping mall - and a cache of assault rifles recovered from the alleged terrorists are seen as underlining the intent to carry out ""spectacular strikes"" in solidarity with JeM which lost its senior leaders during Operation Sindoor. The blast was preceded by arrests of a doctor and a few others in Gujarat who were plotting to carry out a bio-terror attack by using ricin, one of the most dangerous substances known.Officials also believe that the explosive device in the car was meant for some other target and that it got accidentally triggered near the Red Fort.The cabinet, which observed two-minute silence, also praised ""the timely and coordinated response of the authorities, security agencies and citizens who acted with courage and compassion in the face of adversity. Their dedication and sense of duty are deeply commendable"".""The cabinet directs that the investigation into the incident be pursued with the utmost urgency and professionalism so that the perpetrators, their collaborators and their sponsors are identified and brought to justice without delay. The situation continues to be closely monitored at the highest levels of govt,"" said the resolution.","The Union cabinet on Wednesday described Monday's car blast near Red Fort as an act of ""terror"" The designation is significant because of the anti-terror doctrine worked out by the Modi govt in the wake of the Pahalgam attack.

NEW DELHI: Umar Un Nabi, confirmed by a DNA test as the bomber in Old Delhi, and his module had planned to carry out a ""spectacular terror attack "" with multiple vehicle-borne IEDs followed by firing with assault rifles. They had procured three vehicles - an i20, a red Ford Ecosport and a Brezza - for their mission, sources in the security establishment said on Wednesday.While the i20 exploded, cops issued a BOLO (be on the lookout) notice for the other two cars, an indication that more explosives may have been hidden by the module. The Ecosport, which has a Delhi registration number ending in 0458, was located Wednesday in Faridabad. A search is on for the Brezza. The cars were allegedly procured by Umar.The probe so far has revealed that besides Delhi, they were planning to target Ayodhya too. An attempt was to be made on Nov 25 during the hoisting of a saffron flag atop the Ram temple, said a source in a security agency. The suspects have revealed they were planning to use, and had collected, a mixture of ammonium nitrate and RDX, but it's unclear if that was the explosive in the car.The plot was hatched in Turkiye way back in 2022. As reported by TOI on Wednesday, Umar was acting on instructions from his Turkiye-based handler, identified by his codename Ukasa.A day after a car blast killed a dozen people near Red Fort, home minister Amit Shah chaired a set of meetings with the security brass and instructed agencies to hunt down every culprit behind the act.""Everyone involved in this act will face the full wrath of our agencies,"" Shah posted on X after the meetings.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the home minister from Bhutan and was briefed by the latter on all aspects of the blast, including the investigation updates. President Droupadi Murmu, who is in Angola, also spoke to Shah over the phone to enquire about the blast.The home minister on Tuesday decided to hand over the investigation into the incident to the National Investigation Agency (NIA). This points to a terror angle, though sources said it may have more to do with the Jaish terror module member linked to the blast.With Dr Umar, who had escaped the recent crackdown on the Faridabad module, suspected to be the car bomber, Shah has asked the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) to match the DNA sample collected from the body found in the i20 car used for the blast with those of Dr Umar's family members.Sources in the J&K security establishment told TOI that DNA samples collected from Dr Umar's family members had been despatched to Delhi. Shah has asked FSL officials to complete the exercise at the earliest. The NIA was instructed to submit a report at the earliest, detailing the preliminary findings.Tuesday's review meetings by Shah were attended by home secretary Govind Mohan, director of Intelligence Bureau Tapan Deka, Delhi Police commissioner Satish Golcha and NIA DG Sadanand Vasant Date.DGP of Jammu and Kashmir Nalin Prabhat joined the meeting virtually.During the meetings, top officials gave detailed presentations on the situation in the aftermath of the blast, the sources said.","Umar Un Nabi, confirmed by a DNA test as the bomber in Old Delhi, and his module had planned to carry out a ""spectacular terror attack "" with multiple vehicle- borne IEDs.

Network and recovery operations

Massive crackdown and heightened security



A thwarted network of radical professionals

NEW DELHI: The high-intensity explosion near Delhi’s Red Fort that killed at least 12 people and injured several others has led to the unearthing of a trans-state “white-collar terror module” involving doctors, clerics, and radicalised professionals. According to officials, the accused were linked to banned terror outfits Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind (AGuH).Joint operations by the Jammu & Kashmir Police, Haryana Police, Uttar Pradesh Police, and central agencies resulted in the arrest of at least seven suspects — including doctors from Al-Falah University in Faridabad and other parts of India — and the recovery of more than 2,900 kilograms of explosives and firearms across multiple states.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has now taken over the probe.Dr Muzammil Ganaie, 35, from Koil in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir, worked at Al-Falah University in Faridabad as a doctor and taught MBBS students. Police identified him as one of the key figures in the terror module.Following his arrest, officials recovered 358 kg of suspected ammonium nitrate, a Krinkov assault rifle, three magazines, 91 live rounds, a pistol with cartridges, timers, batteries, remote controls, and other bomb-making material from his rented accommodation in Dhauj, Faridabad.Police told agencies that Muzammil conducted multiple reconnaissance visits of the Red Fort area in January, mapping crowd movements and security positions. “These visits were part of a detailed reconnaissance ahead of a planned attack on January 26,” a senior police officer told PTI.According to the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) team, around 40 samples collected from the Red Fort blast site indicated that one explosive sample was likely ammonium nitrate.Dr Adeel Ahmad Rather, from Kulgam in Kashmir, was arrested from Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh. He was also employed at Al-Falah University, working closely with Dr Muzammil and Dr Umar Un Nabi.Police sources told PTI that an AK-47 rifle was recovered from his locker at GMC Srinagar, where he had earlier worked as a senior resident. He is accused of being part of the Faridabad module that stockpiled explosives and weapons.Adeel’s arrest came after Muzammil’s interrogation, which revealed their collaboration in transporting and concealing explosives across multiple sites.Dr Umar Un Nabi, from Pulwama, was also associated with Al-Falah University and was reportedly driving the i20 car that exploded near the Red Fort, killing over 10 people.Sources told PTI that Dr Umar had been under surveillance but changed locations frequently. “He maintained close ties with Dr Muzammil and Dr Adeel, coordinating logistics and storage of explosives,” an official said.Authorities confirmed that Umar was present in the vehicle during the blast. His alleged role as the executioner of the attack places him among the most critical suspects in the ongoing probe.Dr Shaheen Sayeed, a doctor from Lucknow, is alleged to be an active associate and close confidant of Dr Muzammil. She was brought by air to Srinagar for custodial interrogation after an assault rifle was recovered from her car in Faridabad.Police said she panicked following Muzammil’s arrest and discarded the weapon in a dustbin. Dr Shaheen reportedly maintained communication between members in Faridabad and contacts in Kashmir.Investigators believe she played a role in logistical coordination for the group’s operations and possibly helped procure chemical materials.Dr Ahmed Mohiyuddin Saiyed, a Hyderabad-based doctor with an MBBS degree from China, was arrested by Gujarat ATS on November 8.He had been running a shawarma business in Rajendranagar, where he was allegedly radicalised through Telegram and social media. Authorities claim he was in contact with a handler named Abu Khadija linked to Islamic State-Khorasan Province (ISKP).Police seized two Glock pistols, a Beretta, live ammunition, and 4 kg of castor-bean mash (used to extract ricin poison). Officials said he conducted reconnaissance of security-sensitive sites in Delhi, Lucknow, and Ahmedabad, with weapons possibly delivered via drones from Pakistan.Two of his aides, Azad Suleman Sheikh (20) and Mohammad Suhail Khan (23), were also arrested.Irfan Ahmad, a cleric and Imam from Shopian, is accused of radicalising several members of the module, including young doctors. Police said he was responsible for motivating recruits and connecting them with militant networks in Kashmir.He was arrested during follow-up raids in Shopian after Dr Muzammil’s confession pointed to his involvement.Maulvi Ishtiaq, a native of Mewat, Haryana, served as Imam at Al-Falah Mosque in Faridabad’s Dhera Colony. Police recovered over 2,500 kilograms of explosives from his residence within the Al-Falah University complex.Officials said he had been staying on campus under the guise of a religious teacher and was detained by Jammu and Kashmir Police before being brought to Srinagar for questioning.He is suspected of providing logistical support, including safe houses and connections to financial channels.Police on Tuesday took another Pulwama doctor, Sajad Malik, into custody for questioning, bringing the number of Kashmir-born doctors linked to the Delhi blast case to four.It remained unclear whether Malik's detention was aimed at gathering information about his friend Umar Un Nabi or if he was also being held as a suspect in the broader terrorism conspiracy.According to the police and intelligence agencies, the seven-member module used encrypted channels for communication, coordination, and movement of explosives.In Faridabad, questioning of over 52 individuals, including faculty and students of Al-Falah University, led to the recovery of the explosive materials and firearms.Subsequent raids in Shopian, Ganderbal, and Anantnag uncovered additional weapons, including an AK-56 rifle, pistols, and large quantities of IED components.Officials confirmed that Dr Muzammil and Dr Umar Un Nabi had plotted an attack during Republic Day celebrations, but the plan was delayed due to heightened security.After the Red Fort blast, the Delhi Police and paramilitary forces tightened security across the national capital. All entry and exit points were sealed, and vehicles were thoroughly checked.Senior officers supervised searches at interstate borders — including Ghazipur, Singhu, Tikri, and Badarpur — while sniffer dogs, anti-sabotage squads, and metal detectors were deployed at crowded locations.A senior police officer said, “We are taking no chances. The focus is on maintaining public confidence and ensuring that the city remains secure.”Officials described the module as a “white-collar terror network” that exploited academic institutions for recruitment and logistics.“The arrests have prevented a major conspiracy aimed at causing large-scale damage in the country,” an intelligence official said, adding that several Pakistani phone numbers were found on seized devices linked to the doctors.Investigations continue across Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh, with more arrests expected in the coming days.(With inputs from PTI, Naseer Ganai and Nikhil Sharma)","The high-intensity explosion near Delhi’s Red Fort has led to the unearthing of a trans-state ‘white-collar terror module’ involving doctors, clerics, and radicalised professionals.

CJI on '79 rape ruling: 'Moment of institutional embarrassment'

'No Remorse, God Provoked Me': Lawyer Rakesh Kishore Defends His Shoe Attack On CJI BR Gavai

NEW DELHI: Admitting that Supreme Court failed its citizens, and it is the vigilance of civil society and courage of ordinary people which have kept the judiciary accountable over the years, the CJI termed SC's 1979 verdict as a ""moment of institutional embarrassment"" which acquitted two policemen accused of raping a young tribal girl inside a police station by taking her ""consent"" as voluntary because there were no visible marks of physical resistance.Delivering the 30th Justice Sunanda Bhandare Memorial Lecture, CJI B R Gavai said the apex court's verdict in Tukaram v. State of Maharashtra, also known as the Mathura case, was an institutional failure, and court's verdict reflected a deeply regressive and patriarchal understanding of consent, effectively denying the social context of power, coercion, and vulnerability in which sexual violence often occurs.""In my view, this decision remains one of the most troubling moments in India's constitutional and judicial history, and I call it a 'moment of institutional embarrassment', where the legal system failed to protect the dignity of the very person it was meant to safeguard. Yet, this judgment also became a turning point. The public outrage and the nationwide protests that followed, led by women's groups, students, and legal activists, ignited the modern Indian women's rights movement.It compelled the nation to confront the inadequacies of its criminal law and catalysed the amendments in criminal law, which redefined the concept of consent and strengthened legal protections against custodial rape,"" CJI Gavai said.The CJI was speaking on the evolution of law in building a gender equal and inclusive India. He said many pathbreaking laws were passed to bring gender justice, and courts also pitched in to ensure equality through judicial pronouncements, barring few exceptions like the 1979 verdict. He said it resulted in dismantling of the structural inequalities embedded in family and custom, bringing women from the margins of dependency to the centre of constitutional citizenship.""Over the past 75 years, India has charted an extraordinary journey in advancing the rights of women and shaping the vision of an inclusive society. From the early struggles for recognition and equality, to the present era of intersectional and participatory justice, the courts have often stood as guardians of equality and human dignity. This evolution has not been without its challenges. There have been moments when judicial interpretations failed to capture the lived realities of women or fell short of the transformative spirit of the Constitution. .. However, the vigilance of civil society, the persistence of women's movements, and the courage of ordinary citizens have together kept the judiciary accountable to the constitutional promise of equality,"" he said.""Therefore, it is important to acknowledge that progress in gender justice has never been the achievement of courts alone. The collective voice of citizens has ensured that regressive precedents were questioned, debated, and ultimately corrected through reform, reinterpretation, or legislative intervention. The dialogue between the courts and the people thus remains one of the most vital sources of India's democratic strength, reminding us that the march toward gender equality is not a destination reached, but a commitment constantly renewed,"" CJI Gavai said.","CJI BR Gavai says Supreme Court failed its citizens, and it is the vigilance of civil society and courage of ordinary people which have kept the judiciary accountable.

Slow Traffic, Then Sudden Fireball: CCTV Captures The Delhi Red Fort Blast That Killed At Least 10

How Kashmir’s Jaish Posters Led To Delhi’s Red Fort Blast And Exposed A Nationwide Terror Network

Chidambaram’s earlier warning during Operation Sindoor debate

NEW DELHI: Former home minister and senior Congress leader P Chidambaram on Wednesday slammed the Centre over its “discreet silence” on what he described as the growing threat of homegrown terrorism.His statement comes two days after the Delhi bomb blast near Lal Quila Metro station that killed 12 people and injured several others.In a post on X addressing the recent Delhi blast and the arrests of educated professionals allegedly involved in the plot, Chidambaram reiterated his long-held concern over the rise of “homegrown terrorism” in India.Chidambaram wrote: “I have maintained before and after the Pahalgam terror attack that there are two kinds of terrorists — foreign-trained infiltrated terrorists and home-grown terrorists. I said so in Parliament during the debate on Operation Sindoor . I was mocked and trolled for the reference to home-grown terrorists. However, I must say that the government observed a discreet silence because the government knows that there are home-grown terrorists too. The point of this tweet is we should ask ourselves what are the circumstances that turn Indian citizens — even educated persons — into terrorists.”His remarks come amid revelations that several suspects have been arrested in the Delhi blast case. This includes doctors Muzammil Ganaie, Adeel Ahmad Rather, Shaheen Shahid and Umar Un Nabi who were allegedly part of a Faridabad-based terror module linked to Jaish-e-Mohammed .Chidambaram’s latest remarks mirror his warning in Parliament during the Operation Sindoor debate. The counter-terror operation was launched after the Pahalgam attack that killed 26 civilians.During the debate, Chidambaram had questioned the government’s handling of the Pahalgam terror attack and the subsequent operation.Raising concerns over the lack of transparency, he asked, “Where are the terrorist attackers? Why have you not apprehended them, or even identified them? A news item had emerged about the arrest of a few people who gave the attackers shelter. What happened to them?”He further questioned the government’s reluctance to disclose details of the probe.“The Government is unwilling to disclose what the NIA has done all these weeks. Have they identified the terrorists, where they came from? For all we know, they could be homegrown terrorists. Why do you assume that they came from Pakistan? There’s no evidence of that,” Chidambaram said.His statement had sparked a sharp backlash from the BJP benches, with Home Minister Amit Shah accusing the Congress leader of “trying to give a clean chit to Pakistan.”Union home minister went on to detail the evidence gathered by investigating agencies.“NIA had already arrested those who gave them shelter. Those who fed them were detained. When the terrorists’ dead bodies reached Srinagar, they were identified as the three people who carried out the terror attack in Pahalgam. The rifles seized from them matched the FSL reports,” Shah said.Following the backlash, Chidambaram defended himself, accusing critics of distorting his remarks. He wrote on X, “Trolls are of different kinds and use different tools to spread misinformation.”","Chidambaram’s latest remarks mirror his warning in Parliament during the Operation Sindoor debate.

‘Only Agencies Know the Truth’: Brother of Delhi Blast Accused Breaks Silence

NEW DELHI: Two days after the deadly car blast near Delhi’s Red Fort, new revelations from the family of arrested doctor Shaheen Sayeed have added a personal dimension to the ongoing terror investigation.Speaking to PTI in Lucknow, Mohammad Shoaib, Shaheen’s elder brother, has said the family is in “complete disbelief” over her alleged link to terrorist activities. He added that they were still struggling to come to terms with the accusations.He confirmed that the police and Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) officials had searched their home but behaved respectfully.“They searched the house and asked questions normally, the same way you are asking me now,” Shoaib said.“Neither my father nor I were treated harshly. There was no pressure or force used to make us say anything. They only asked about when my sister stopped visiting us.”Shoaib revealed that the family had not been in contact with Shaheen for the past four years. However, their parents occasionally called to check on her well-being.“We have had no contact. It’s been four years since we last spoke. Parents will naturally call their children to ask how they are doing.I am her elder brother, of course, I would also worry about her. Isn’t that normal?” he said.When asked if he had ever visited her residence near IIM Road in Lucknow, Shoaib replied: “No, I have never gone there. I only knew that she has a house somewhere along the IIM Road. I don’t even know the exact location.”He said there was never any reason to suspect her of wrongdoing.“Even when she was studying medicine, there was never any sign of her being involved in anything suspicious. I still don’t believe these allegations. As I have said before, I simply cannot believe it,” he said.Shaheen’s former husband, Dr Zafar Hayat, who lives in Kanpur, also expressed shock over her alleged role in the case. He said he learned about her arrest only a day earlier.Hayat and Shaheen married in November 2003 and got divorced in 2012. Both were doctors, and he recalled her as “a loving mother and caring person.”“Our divorce took place towards the end of 2012. I am not sure what was on her mind that led to it. There was never any dispute or quarrel between us. She was a loving and caring person,” he said.“I never had any inkling that she could be involved in such activities. She was deeply attached to her family and children, loved them immensely and took care of their studies,” Hayat added.Recalling their marriage, he said: “I had never seen her in a burqa. She only wore it during the wedding rituals. I have no idea about her alleged involvement in any terror activities now being reported. Our divorce happened long ago, in 2012, and if she got involved in something later, I know nothing about it.”He also remembered a conversation they once had about settling abroad.Dr Hayat recalled that Shaheen had once suggested settling in Australia or Europe for better pay and quality of life; however, he told her that they already had good jobs and a comfortable life in India, surrounded by family and friends.Hayat said he was unaware that Shaheen had returned to India and maintained that she showed no signs of any extremist beliefs during their years together.According to investigators, Dr Shaheen Sayeed, associated with Al-Falah University in Faridabad, was among those arrested following Monday’s explosion near the Red Fort.Police suspect she was linked to Dr Muzammil Ganaie, another faculty member at the same university, alleged to be part of a “white-collar terror module” with ties to Jaish-e-Mohammed and Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind.Authorities said the module spread across Kashmir, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh was exposed after the recovery of 2,900 kg of explosives and the arrest of eight people, including three doctors from Al-Falah University.Investigators claim that Shaheen headed Jaish-e-Mohammed’s women’s recruitment wing, Jamaat-ul-Mominat in India.Her father, Syed Ahmad Ansari also expressed shock at the allegations.“I last spoke to Shaheen about a month ago. I have never heard her mention Dr Muzammil or anyone involved in such activities,” he said.Her father added that she had completed her medical studies in Prayagraj.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) is probing the Red Fort blast which police said was caused by a high-intensity explosive device planted in a car.Investigations by police teams across Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh are continuing into the wider multi-state module.The explosion occurred around 7 pm on Monday at the Subhash Marg traffic signal, near the Red Fort Metro Station. The high-intensity blast ripped through a slow-moving Hyundai i20 car, killing at least 12 people and injuring several others.","Mohammad Shoaib, Shaheen Sayeed's elder brother, says family is in 'complete disbelief' Says family had not been in contact with her for past four years.

This must be protected at all costs and those trying to shatter the dreams of our youth must be strictly dealt with,” the LG said.Later, while inaugurating the International Film Festival in Srinagar, Sinha exhorted the film-makers to come up with films that narrate the ordeal of terror victims, expose the ringleaders of terror ecosystem and showcase the transformation after August 2019.He said people must expose the enemies of peace by providing information about them to the police and security agencies, so that the entire terror ecosystem hiding behind cover of the society is neutralised and a befitting reply given to evil intentions of the neighbouring country.“Society must come together to guard this peace, progress, joy and renewed hope,” said the LG seeking the cooperation of all sections of the public.","Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha said ‘our neighbouring country’ and some terrorist elements based in the J&K were trying to disrupt the Union territory’s progress. “We must be alert against such ecosystem and work together to foil their efforts,” he advised while addressing the valedictory function of Islamic University of Science and Technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125285284,imgsize-26426,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

Doctor’s Car Leads To Chilling Terror Trail, Face Of Suspect Revealed

NEW DELHI: Nisar Ul Hassan, a doctor who was sacked by J&K LG Manoj Sinha in Nov 2023 from Srinagar's SHMS hospital over terror links, was hired by Al-Falah School of Medical Science and Research Centre, Faridabad, soon after and has emerged as a key suspect in the case relating to the JeM module behind Monday's Delhi car blast.TOI had on Wednesday exclusively reported that Hassan's role as the man behind radicalising and indoctrinating medical professionals including suspected car, bomber Umar Nabi, who worked with him in the general medicine department of Al-Falah, was under the scanner.Investigators suspect that given Hassan's long history of ""consistently providing moral and background support to the secessionists and terrorists within Kashmir and continuously fuelling and furthering, under the patronage of Pakistani proxies, separatist ideology within medical professionals of J&K"", he could well have been the mastermind and prime motivator of the doctors working for the Jaish module comprising the arrested Dr Muzammil, Dr Adeel, Dr Shaheen and Dr Parvez, besides the supposedly deceased Dr Umar. ""The Hassan link... is a validation of dismissals that J&K LG Manoj Sinha has been ordering under Article 311(2)c to dismantle the terror ecosystem. But it now seems some of these elements managed a free run outside J&K,"" said an officer.A source wondered how Hassan was immediately taken in by the Al-Falah University despite the public order by LG dismissing him for terror links. ""Were no pre-hiring background checks run on him? Or was the university aware of his controversial past but still hired him?"" asked an officer.Even Dr Shaheen was sacked by a Kanpur medical college for absence from duty, before being hired by Al-Falah. It is also intriguing how well-qualified Kashmiri doctors with MD degrees ended up working for the relatively unknown University at a nondescript location in Faridabad.As per the intelligence dossier prepared by J&K CID that had laid ground for Hassan's dismissal in 2023, he was a self-styled president of Doctors Association of Kashmir (DAK) for last eight years without having participated in DAK elections and used the forum to issue controversial media statements backing separatists and terrorists and exhorting Kashmiri youths, including medical professionals, to ""fight for the noble cause of freedom of Kashmir"". The dossier described Hassan as ""a potential time-bomb, which can be re-installed by Pakistan and its terrorist-secessionist network at any given point of time to cause widespread violence and disturbance against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of India"".Hassan, as per J&K CID, ""clearly propagated a highly vicious ideology that so long Kashmir is part of India, nothing good can happen in Kashmir"". After four terrorists were killed by security forces when they attacked CRPF camp at Shopian in 2013, he ""had brazenly provoked people to come in support of 'terrorists' by labelling them as 'mujahids' fighting for the freedom of Kashmir from India."" An official said he was an associate of Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru and after the latter was hanged in 2013, he issued a press statement exhorting youth to start a new struggle until the Kashmir issue was resolved.Hassan had rejected the 2014 polls in Kashmir.He also said Kashmiri doctors will provide free of cost treatment to all victims of ""oppression"". In 2015, when he was suspended from SHMS hospital, separatists like Syed Ali Shah Geelani and Yasin Malik had come in his support.","Nisar Ul Hassan was sacked by J&K LG Manoj Sinha in Nov 2023 from Srinagar's SHMS hospital over terror links.

SRINAGAR: J&K police intensified their sweeping operation to dismantle terrorist support networks and the banned Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI), searching over 200 locations in south Kashmir’s Kulgam district and questioning more than 500 people, including a doctor, as the crackdown entered its fifth day Tuesday.The campaign across Kashmir valley has gathered pace after the unearthing of a “white-collar” terrorist network involving Kashmir-born doctors in Haryana’s Faridabad and UP, suspected to be linked to the November 10 car blast in New Delhi. In total, police have summoned over 1,500 people for questioning in recent days.Among those questioned was Dr Malik Tajamul-ul-Islam of Kulgam. His father said Malik, an MBBS graduate from Govt Medical College in Srinagar and preparing for his MD entrance exams, was called to a Srinagar police station.“They took his phone and asked about our cold storage facility in Kulgam and its finances,” the father told reporters. “He was released later, and I received him outside the station. He was only questioned about the cold storage.”A senior officer said the latest phase in Kulgam began early Wednesday, targeting JeI-linked members and their associates as part of efforts to “dismantle the terrorist ecosystem at the grassroots”.Searches covered homes of “over ground workers” and people whose relatives had migrated to Pakistan or PoK and allegedly joined outfits there.“About 500 people were interrogated. Many were bound down and shifted to Anantnag jail under preventive laws,” the officer said.Parallel searches in north Kashmir’s Sopore and south Kashmir’s Awantipora focused on JeI-linked people. Police reported seizing digital devices and “incriminating material” during these operations, while “several JeI members were questioned and detained under law”.In a related move, authorities ordered the attachment of the Srinagar home of lawyer Mian Abdul Qayoom, former president of J&K High Court Bar Association, in a 2009 case concerning an event marking Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s death anniversary. Police said Qayoom and others, including Asiya Andrabi and Shabir Ahmad Najar, made anti-India speeches and raised separatist slogans at the seminar in a Srinagar hotel.Police said witness statements established that the seminar’s participants had “provoked the audience, made inflammatory remarks, and advocated the secession of J&K”.Qayoom is currently jailed in the 2020 murder conspiracy case of lawyer Babar Qadri. He allegedly used his two-storey house and adjoining land at Bulbul Bagh in Barzulla to “conceal incriminating material and aid unlawful activities”, police said.A search of the property, conducted on a magistrate’s warrant, allegedly led to the confiscation of banned literature, a Hizbul Mujahideen letterhead with seal impression, a press note, a letter addressed by Hizbul chief Syed Salahuddin to then US President Bill Clinton, and another Hizbul seal in Urdu.","J&K police intensify their sweeping operation to dismantle terrorist support networks and the banned Jamaat-e-Islami.

He urged Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann and DGP Gaurav Yadav to take action against those responsible.“At 4 pm, while driving with my wife on the Zirakpur flyover, two Punjab Police jeeps escorting a VIP towards Ambala came up behind us with sirens blaring. I slowed down to let the first vehicle pass. The VIP car may have taken three extra seconds to cross because of heavy traffic,” Hooda wrote on X.“Angered, the rear escort jeep, while overtaking from the left, deliberately swerved right, hit the front of my car, and sped away,” he added. The retired officer said the impact damaged his car and that the police drivers showed “no concern” for his or his wife’s safety amid the busy traffic.“The arrogance and impunity of someone who is supposed to be a guardian of law soils the uniform and reputation of the organisation,” Hooda remarked.Responding on X, the Punjab Police DGP’s office regretted the “distress and concern caused.” It added that such behaviour, if proven, would be “completely unacceptable and contrary to the values of professionalism and public service that Punjab Police stands for.”“I have personally discussed the matter with Special DGP Traffic AS Rai, and directions have been issued to identify the vehicles and personnel involved. Please be assured that the matter is being taken seriously and appropriate action will be initiated,” the DGP stated.Hooda later noted that his car did not have a dashcam, adding that “my word, if honourable, would have to do.”A decorated officer, Lt Gen (retired) Hooda was commissioned into the Indian Army in December 1976 and retired in November 2016, two months after overseeing the surgical strikes in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir following the Uri terror attacks.","Lt Gen (retired) BS Hooda alleges his car was hit by two Punjab Police vehicles.

Trump ‘knew about the girls’ at Epstein’s house: Democrats make bombshell claim after email leak; White House hits back,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-knew-about-the-girls-at-epsteins-house-democrats-make-bombshell-claim-after-email-leak/articleshow/125277347.cms,"Email to Ghislaine Maxwell



Email to Michael Wolff in 2019



Email discussing Trump’s media exposure



White House responds







Democrats have released a set of emails that they say raise new questions about the relationship between US President Donald Trump and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.In the messages, Epstein claimed Trump had “spent hours at my house” with one of his victims and “knew about the girls,” many of whom were later found to be underage, reports The New York Times.Trump has repeatedly denied any knowledge of or involvement in pedophile Epstein’s crimes. He has said that while the two were once friendly, they parted ways long before Epstein’s 2019 death in federal custody, which was ruled a suicide.According to Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, the emails were chosen from thousands of pages of material turned over by Epstein’s estate. They said the content of the messages raised “glaring questions” about what the White House may still be withholding.“These latest emails and correspondence raise glaring questions about what else the White House is hiding and the nature of the relationship between Epstein and the president,” said Representative Robert Garcia of California, the panel’s top Democrat.In one of the emails from April 2011, Epstein told his right-hand woman, Ghislaine Maxwell, “I want you to realise that that dog that hasn’t barked is Trump.” He added that one of his victims “spent hours at my house with him, he has never once been mentioned.”Maxwell replied, “I have been thinking about that."" She is now serving a 20-year sentence for aiding Epstein’s crimes.Another message, dated January 2019, was addressed to author Michael Wolff. Epstein wrote, “Of course he knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine to stop.” According to Democrats, this email was sent months before Epstein’s arrest that year.A third email, sent in December 2015, showed Epstein discussing with Wolff how to manage media attention during Trump’s rise in the Republican primaries. Wolff warned that CNN planned to ask Trump about his relationship with Epstein, to which Epstein replied, “If we were able to craft an answer for him, what do you think it should be?” Wolff responded, “I think you should let him hang himself. If he says he hasn’t been on the plane or to the house, then that gives you a valuable PR and political currency. ”The White House accused Democrats of spreading a ""fake narrative"" after they released emails in which Jeffrey Epstein allegedly suggested that Donald Trump was aware of his sexual abuse. In a statement, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said, ""The Democrats selectively leaked emails to the liberal media to create a fake narrative to smear President Trump.""Trump has dismissed any ties to Epstein as a “hoax,” calling Epstein a “creep” and insisting he had no involvement in his sex-trafficking operation.Epstein and Trump were both part of Palm Beach’s social circles in the 1990s and early 2000s. Trump has previously said he banned Epstein from his Mar-a-Lago resort after hearing allegations that Epstein had hired away one of the club’s staff, later identified by some reports as Virginia Giuffre. Giuffre was one of the most well-known victims of Epstein, who committed suicide earlier this year.The release of the emails comes as House Democrats push for full disclosure of all Epstein-related documents, which US Attorney General Pam Bondi had pledged to release before Trump’s second term. Lawmakers say the Trump administration had earlier promised to make the files public but later went back on its word.","Jeffrey Epstein claimed Trump had'spent hours at my house' with one of his victims and 'knew about the girls' Trump has repeatedly denied any knowledge of or involvement in pedophile Epstein's crimes.

IDF’s Rare Action Against Israeli Settlers After Major Arson Attack In West Bank





US President Donald Trump has sent a letter to his Israeli counterpart Isaac Herzog, urging him to consider granting a pardon to Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, who is currently on trial in three separate corruption cases, the Presidency of Israel said on Wednesday. In a statement, Herzog’s office said: “This morning, President Isaac Herzog received the attached letter from US President Donald Trump, calling on him to consider granting a pardon to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.” It added that “anyone seeking a Presidential pardon must submit a formal request in accordance with the established procedures.”Netanyahu has been indicted in 2019 on corruption, bribery and breach-of-trust charges, including allegations of accepting gifts worth nearly 700,000 shekels (about US $211,000) from businessmen. He denies the charges and has pleaded not guilty.Trump’s letter contends that the case against Netanyahu is “a political, unjustified prosecution” reflecting his long-standing alliance with Trump and opposition to Iran.While the Israeli presidency is largely ceremonial, Herzog does hold the constitutional authority to grant pardons under exceptional circumstances.

The House of Representatives passed a bill Wednesday to end the nation’s longest government shutdown, sending the measure to President Donald Trump for his signature after a historic 43-day funding lapse.The lapse had left federal workers without multiple paychecks, travellers stranded at airports, and people queuing at food banks to get a meal for their families.Lawmakers returned to the nation’s capital this week after nearly eight weeks away, with Republicans using their slight majority to carry the bill by a vote of 222-209. The Senate had already passed the measure, AP reported.Thunderous applause could be heard in the House of Representatives as the bill to end the shutdown passed.At the end, Six Democrats crossed the aisle to back the Republican-led measure.

Instead, cameras will be allowed into the Oval Office for the on-camera signing, according to the White House.The change in schedule follows a White House press briefing earlier in the day, during which press secretary Karoline Leavitt hinted that reporters might see the President later in the evening when he signs the bill.The signing would mark the official end of the longest government shutdown in US history.","Six Democrats crossed the aisle to back the Republican-led measure.

The post for which Elijah has been sued.

Sued for a repost? MAGA disowns Kash Patel, stands with Elijah









Right-wing podcaster Candace Owens has now called for FBI director Kash Patel's resignation after his girlfriend Alexis Wilkins sued Elijah Schaffer for $5 million. Schaffer, a MAGA podcaster, reposted a thread on the viral conspiracy theory that Wilkins is a Mossad agent and she honeytrapped Kash Patel. Schaffer did not add anything on his part to the viral thread but posted a photo of Patel with his girlfriend.Schaffer became the third MAGA operative to have been sued by Kash Patel's girlfriend -- the other two being Kyle Seraphin, a former FBI agent, and Sam Paker , an influencer. Wilkins repeatedly dismissed these conspiracy theories about her and asserted that she has no connection with Israel, never been there, and she has been dating Kash Patel before Patel became the FBI director.As the conspiracy theory is being churned by MAGA insiders, it is clear that Patel has been isolated inside MAGA. And now, Candace has openly called for Patel's resignation. ""Kash Patel has to step down. This is excruciatingly embarrassing. He’s a teenager in love representing the Federal government,"" Candace said.Responding to the lawsuit in a post on X, Schaffer called it ""the legal equivalent of your romantic partner getting mad at you for cheating on her in her dream"".""Totally delusional and paranoid legal behavior - still can’t believe Kash is trusted w/ the FBI & sanctioned this stupidity,"" Schaffer wrote. Schaffer also appealed to Elon Musk for help reminding Musk that he once said he would pay for the legal fees of anyone sued for their free speech posts on X.Elijah Schaffer is where MAGA drew the line and pushed back on Alexis Wilkins' lawsuits. MAGA activists ranted that the FBI director has no real job but to fund his girlfriend's lawsuits against people who share some posts on social media.But Patel made it clear before that he would not allow any attack on his family. In a long post that he recently made, he also hinted that the attacks were coming from supposed allies. “The disgustingly baseless attacks against Alexis — a true patriot and the woman I’m proud to call my partner in life — are beyond pathetic. She is a rock-solid conservative and a country music sensation who has done more for this nation than most will in ten lifetimes. I’m so blessed she’s in my life. Attacking her isn’t just wrong — it’s cowardly and jeopardizes our safety.

The light of our nations will outshine the darkness of our enemies,"" he said in a follow-up post.On Tuesday, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar also expressed sympathies. On X, Saar wrote, ""I extend my & Israel's deepest condolences to the People of India and especially to the families of the innocent victims killed in the blast at the heart of Delhi.""He also wished ""speedy recovery to the wounded.""

MAGA supporters were not happy and erupted online over the president’s comments.

“Maybe POTUS doesn't know we have engineers and techies who are on that unemployment line, or far under employed because the companies who hire H1Bs don't advertise to Americans. Ignorance is not becoming in a president,” one wrote.

“When a president loses faith in his own people, he forfeits the nation’s soul. To distrust your citizens while flooding the country with 600,000 students from a rival power isn’t leadership—it’s betrayal. A nation without trust cannot stand.”

“Horrific, insulting answer to the hundreds of thousands of displaced workers in tech and beyond. Meanwhile new grads sit in the unemployment line so someone from mostly 1 other country can take their place.”

“I don't know who you are lady, but you just absolutely permanently destroyed what remained of the positive image that I, and many others, had of Trump. Thanks for revealing who he really is.”

“Thanks for doing your job. It's too bad POTUS turned his back on the American people and sold us out to foreigners and big corporations.”





US President Donald Trump’s latest comments on H-1B visas stirred a row within his MAGA base, after he appeared to soften his tough stance on immigration by suggesting the US should welcome more foreign workers to the land of bald eagles.In a Fox News interview with Laura Ingraham on Tuesday, Trump said that the US is in dire need of skilled immigrant workers in key industries.“I agree, but you also have to bring this talent,” he said when asked whether H‑1B visa reform remains a top priority. He added that while he supports raising wages for American workers, the US cannot rely solely on long-term unemployed Americans for highly technical roles in manufacturing or defence.When the interviewer said there was plenty of talent in the US and no need to flood industries with thousands of foreign workers, Trump denied it without hesitation.“No, you don't. There are certain skills you don't have, and people have to learn them. You can't take people off the unemployment line and say, 'I'm going to put you into a factory where we're going to make missiles,’” Trump said.The GOP leader also argued that industries requiring specialised expertise cannot be filled by untrained or long-term unemployed workers. “You can't just say a country is coming in, going to invest $10 billion to build a plant, and take people off the unemployment line who haven't worked in five years, and they're going to start making missiles. It doesn't work that way,” he said.Trump’s remarks come after his administration implemented a $100,000 fee for new H‑1B visa applications in September.","Donald Trump appeared to soften his tough stance on immigration by suggesting the US should welcome more foreign workers to the land of bald eagles.

'You Don’t Have Talent in US': Donald Trump’s Shocking Shift on H-1B Visa Policy Debate

Why Nalin's 'America first' stance stands out



Where this might lead







At 24, Nalin Haley is the son of Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and US ambassador to the United Nations.The Indian-American elite was raised in the public eye and educated at Villanova University. Recently, Nalin has stirred a row due to his outspoken views on immigration and foreign-worker visas.In an interview with Fox News, Nalin made clear that there is no need for foreign worker visas: “At the end of the day, my loyalty is to America and that’s part of assimilation.” He went on to say, “We need to get rid of the foreign worker visas. We need to ban H‑1B visas. And we need to punish companies that are not putting American workers first and are putting foreigners first. It is a massive problem.”He also explained the personal reason behind the position: “My main friend group graduated with great degrees from great schools. It’s been a year and a half since graduation. Not one of them has a job.”Given his mother’s Indian-American heritage, Nalin’s stance has sparked considerable debate. While some MAGA activists have celebrated his anti-immigration position, others have pointed out his own roots as a form of hypocrisy.Nalin said: “I mean, they shouldn’t be because I’ve seen how it’s affected my friends and those around me. At the end of the day, my loyalty is to America.”Nalin’s argument focuses on assimilation and national identity. He takes a firm stance against those who think they can stay as they were, saying they need to fully embrace American culture.Nalin criticised previous approaches to immigration and said people need to ""assimilate"": “What we saw with Obama is that we had a lot of immigrants coming here, and the thought was, ‘Oh, you don’t need to change. You don’t need to have your loyalty to America. You could be who you are’. No, you need to assimilate. And you need to act like an American and support American values and support American workers and American people. ”Nalin is not currently in elected office; however, his views align with a strand of American political discourse that favours tightening legal immigration, prioritising American workers over H‑1B visa holders, and reassessing corporate reliance on foreign-worker visas. His remarks could influence younger conservative voices and reflect generational frustrations in the job market.","Nalin Haley is the son of Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and US ambassador to the United Nations.

MAGA activist and Trump ally Laura Loomer launched an attack on New York mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani , saying the socialist should be “denaturalised.”In a post on X, the right-winger wrote, “People are now taking Polymarket bets on whether or not Zohran Mamdani will be deported. He should certainly be denaturalized. Only in America can an Islamic immigrant from Africa openly support terrorism, maintain their citizenship and become Mayor of America’s most iconic city. ”Her comments stirred a row online, with many accusing her of Islamophobia and xenophobia.This is not the first time Loomer has targeted Mamdani, the 33-year-old who defeated Andrew Cuomo in the NYC mayoral race earlier this month. In May, Loomer posted on X, “Get ready for another 9/11,” referring to him as a “pro-HAMAS Muslim socialist.”Earlier this month, Laura Loomer was officially credentialed to cover the US Department of Defense. Her inclusion comes as part of a broader overhaul of the Pentagon press corps that has raised concern over press freedom and transparency under the GOP administration.Loomer is a vocal Trump supporter known for spreading conspiracy theories and targeting Muslim and immigrant politicians. She will now have formal access to Pentagon briefings and events. The decision to grant her credentials has raised eyebrows among journalists and policy observers, many of whom view it as part of a larger effort to reshape media access under an increasingly politicised environment.Mamdani built his campaign around housing affordability, free public buses, taxing the rich and rent freezes — issues that have resonated with younger voters and working-class communities across the city.","Right-winger Laura Loomer said Zohran Mamdani should be 'denaturalized' Loomers comments stirred a row online, with many accusing her of Islamophobia and xenophobia.

Tears & heartbreak as families receive bodies of blast victims





NEW DELHI: Confirming that Monday’s blast near Red Fort was a terror attack, Delhi Police has registered an FIR under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.Initial intelligence inputs suggest that the blast was carried out by a Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) module seeking to avenge the extensive damage inflicted on the outfit’s Bahawalpur headquarters duringAs reported earlier, Dr Umar Un Nabi, a member of the so-called “doctor module” who had escaped during raids by J&K Police, has been identified as the man present in the car who executed the “lone wolf fidayeen attack.”As reported by TOI on Tuesday, Umar Un Nabi, a member of the ""doctor module"" who had escaped during raids by J&K Police, has been confirmed as the man present in the car who carried out the 'lone wolf fidayeen attack'.The initial investigation indicates that the handlers were based in Turkiye and Nangarhar in Afghanistan. They were in touch with Umar and other members of the module.Sleuths suspect that Umar panicked after the arrest of his associate and the main accused in the Faridabad module, Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie, and hit the road with the car rigged with high-end explosives to escape arrest.Dr Umar Un Nabi, who has emerged as the prime suspect behind Monday's suspected fidayeen car blast near Red Fort, was the most radicalised member of the Faridabad module, which included the arrested Dr Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie, Dr Adeel Majeed Rather, Dr Sajad Malik and Dr Shaheen Shahid, sources connected with the investigation said on Tuesday.Shaheen, during her interrogation in Srinagar on Monday night, conceded that Umar would passionately speak of ""unleashing multiple terror attacks in the country"" every time they met after work at the Al-Falah Medical College.Sources told TOI he, along with Muzammil and Adeel, had been amassing fertiliser-based explosives like ammonium nitrate for almost two years, purportedly for use in pan-India terror attacks on behalf of terror outfit Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM).Muzammil, Adeel and Shaheen were earlier arrested by J&K police in coordinated action with UP police and Haryana police. Umar, who was teaching at Al-Falah Medical College in Faridabad, however, managed to slip away and is believed to have gone underground, only to resurface as a suspected fidayeen car bomber. He is suspected to have packed an i20 car with commercially available explosives like ammonium nitrate and detonators and triggered an IED blast in a crowded spot near Red Fort.Questioning of the arrested doctors in J&K points to a wider Jaish network. Shaheen revealed that her brother, Parvez Sayeed, was also radicalised and part of the same chat group as Muzammil and Adeel. A J&K police team on Tuesday visited Lucknow and picked up Parvez but could not make any significant recoveries.""It is possible that he got rid of the explosives, anticipating arrest,"" said an officer. A Gurugram-based ammonium nitrate supplier has also been identified and may soon face raids and arrest.Source said the raids in Faridabad and the Delhi blast have exposed a network of clerics engaged in indoctrination, including a Shopian-based maulvi, Irfan Ahmed Waghey, who was directly in touch with Pakistan-based Jaish handler Umar bin Khattab, alias Harjulla.Another cleric, Mewat-based Hafiz Mohd Ishtiyak, was providing logistics to the terrorists. These clerics were using social media platforms to radicalise highly qualified professionals like doctors for carrying out pan-India terror attacks on behalf of JeM. ""Medicine being a noble profession offered the doctors a perfect cover for their conspiratorial agenda,"" an officer noted.This is not the first time that a Kashmiri doctor has been found engaged in terror activities. In Nov 2023, J&K LG Manoj Sinha had dismissed Dr Nisar Ul Hassan, assistant professor (medicine) at SMHS Hospital, Srinagar, over terror links. Hassan was a self-styled president of the Doctors' Association of Kashmir (DAK), which was supposedly used by him as a cover to orient medical professionals in J&K towards secessionism, under the patronage of Pakistani proxies.""It is a matter of investigation if Hassan had any role in radicalising the Kashmiri doctors arrested in Faridabad or involved in the Delhi blast,"" said an officer.","Dr Umar Un Nabi has emerged as the prime suspect behind Monday's suspected fidayeen car blast near Red Fort.

Terrifying CCTV Captures Delhi’s Red Fort Blast; Vehicles Erupt in Fireball

Vehicles and the blast: Umar drove the i20 that blew up near the Red Fort on Nov 10. The EcoSport was traced to Faridabad; police have issued BOLOs for the Brezza amid fears more explosives or devices may be hidden. Sources say Umar was the principal procurer of the three cars.





International direction: The plot has an overseas thread. Probe teams say the plan was hatched in Turkiye in 2022. Umar travelled to Ankara in March that year for two weeks and operated under instructions from a Turkey‑based handler codenamed “Ukasa”, according to agency sources. The module’s encrypted conversations began on Telegram and migrated to Signal and Session apps.





Explosives trail: Investigators found the module had been collecting explosive material since 2022 — intelligence referred to an initial accumulation of over 350 kg of explosive components. After the seizure that followed Dr Muzammil’s arrest, searches in Faridabad uncovered a much larger stash — nearly 2,900 kg of ammonium nitrate and other explosive substances stored across two rented rooms, police say.





University link: Both Umar and Dr Muzammil (Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie) were on the faculty of Al‑Falah University in Faridabad. Muzammil, who taught MBBS students, is accused of arranging multiple reconnaissance visits to Red Fort earlier this year and of using rented rooms near campus to receive and stash material. Their presence in the university — which houses a growing medical college — has widened the probe to colleagues, staff who helped with logistics, and anyone who may have assisted in securing vehicles or premises.





Targets and timeline: Beyond Delhi, investigators say the group planned to strike Ayodhya — an attempt was allegedly plotted for Nov 25, coinciding with a ceremonial hoisting at the Ram temple. Documents and interrogation accounts indicate the module intended phased actions, with some plans extending towards Republic Day 2026.





How the operation unravelled: J&K police action and subsequent forensic leads led to the Faridabad seizures and Muzammil’s arrest. Sources say the bust prompted Umar to go on the run; he remained mobile for more than 16 hours before detonating the i20. CCTV, toll‑plaza footage and vehicle tracings have become important pieces of the timeline as agencies attempt to map accomplices and pick up any remaining sleeper cells.





What investigators have recovered from the university‑linked searches

Notebooks and diaries from campus lodgings with coded entries, repeated use of the word “operation”, and dates around Nov 8–12 .





. Lists with 25–30 names — many traced to Jammu & Kashmir, Faridabad and neighbouring areas — suggesting a wider support network.





Evidence of a Signal group formed by Umar with 2–4 members for coordination.





Agency response and next steps





NEW DELHI: Umar Un Nabi — confirmed by a DNA test as the man who detonated an IED near Old Delhi’s Red Fort on Nov 10 — and a small “white‑coat” module that included three fellow doctors had plotted a multi‑vehicle, multi‑strike attack, investigators say.The module procured three cars — a Hyundai i20 (which exploded), a red Ford EcoSport (DL‑10 CK‑0458), and a Maruti Suzuki Brezza — and intended to use vehicle‑borne IEDs followed by firing with assault rifles in a “spectacular” coordinated strike.Also read: Delhi car blast probe: Next terror attack may have been planned on Babri Masjid demolition anniversary Security sources and probe officers described a tightly knit operation that was hatched overseas, rehearsed locally, and fuelled by clandestine communications, cash transfers and large caches of explosives.Large consignments of ammonium nitrate and components typically used to make powerful IEDs, moved in multiple batches to rented rooms in Dhauj and Fatehpur Taga.The National Investigation Agency, J&K Police and Haryana Police are jointly probing the module’s origin, financing and logistics.Officers say they are tracing supply chains for explosives, vehicle purchases, handlers abroad, and any university staff who may have assisted — knowingly or unwittingly.Intelligence agencies are also combing travel and communication records to map the Turkey link and identify other operatives.An officer involved in the probe said: “They intended a spectacular attack — vehicle IEDs followed by firing. The overseas direction, reconnaissance and the scale of material recovered make this one of the most serious modules we have seen in recent years.”","Umar Un Nabi was confirmed by a DNA test as the man who detonated an IED near Old Delhi’s Red Fort on Nov 10.

Delhi terror plot: Diaries reveal 2-year conspiracy; Al-Falah doctors planned multiple blasts between Nov 8–12,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/faridabad/delhi-car-blast-doctors-diaries-reveal-2-years-of-planning-multiple-attacks-names-numbers-with-dates-from-nov-812/articleshow/125288071.cms,"How Kashmir’s Jaish Posters Led To Delhi’s Red Fort Blast And Exposed A Nationwide Terror Network





FARIDABAD: Notebooks and diaries recovered during searches over Tuesday and Wednesday from campus lodgings of two Al-Falah University doctors involved in the Delhi terror plot indicate they were planning multiple strikes for over two years, sources involved in the probe told TOI.Evidence allegedly recovered from room 13 (where Muzammil Ganaie lived) and Umar Un Nabi’s room (No. 4) points towards an elaborate terror plot.According to investigators, the notebooks and diaries were filled with coded references, names and numbers with dates from Nov 8-12, suggesting the doctors were planning multiple attacks. The word ‘operation’ was scribbled repeatedly on the diaries.Umar, who was driving the i20 that blew up near Red Fort metro station on Nov 10, and Muzammil, who had rented the two rooms in Faridabad from where nearly 3,000kg of ammonium nitrate and other explosive substances were found last week, had both joined Al-Falah in close succession during the pandemic – Umar in 2021 and Muzammil six months after that, the sources said.The diaries were also found to contain names of 2530 people, most of whom are either from Jammu & Kashmir, Muzammil and Umar’s home state, or Faridabad and nearby areas, giving investigators an idea of the contours of this white coat terror module.Several university staff, among them a compounder at Al-Falah Hospital, have been detained for questioning, sources said.“The Delhi blast happened on Nov 10. Even if it was not meant to happen that day, the coded messages in the diaries suggest they were planning something big between Nov 8 and 12,” a source said.The investigation has widened to include anyone who may have assisted the suspects. “Those who provided batteries, helped arrange vehicles, secured rented accommodations, and university staff are all under scrutiny. Regular searches are being carried out to check if there are more locations where explosives could be stored,” an investigator said.Police have recovered CCTV footage from toll booths and other locations, identifying several people who were seen with Umar in the days leading up to the blast. On Wednesday, police also recovered a red Ford EcoSport with the registration number DL10CK-0458 from Khandawli village of Faridabad. The vehicle, which is believed to belong to Umar, was scanned by the bomb squad to ensure it did not contain any explosives. “We will have to check if the car was also used in the Delhi blast plot,” said Yashpal, a spokesperson for Faridabad police.Sources said the timeline of events suggested a carefully coordinated operation.After Muzammil’s arrest on Oct 30, Umar left the university the same day and never returned. He had been on leave from Oct 21 to 25. “We are yet to determine where he stayed during these 10 days after he left the university. Identifying those who helped him during this period is crucial.National Investigation Agency, J&K and Haryana police, and others are working together to track down every operative and sleeper cell linked to this terror module,” an officer said.Background checks have revealed that Muzammil had previously posted on social media in support of Afzal Guru, who was executed for his role in the 2001 Parliament attack.The discovery of 2,900kg of explosives and arms and ammunition after Muzammil’s arrest has led to criticism of intelligence agencies and Haryana Police for failing to detect the stockpiling of such dangerous materials. Investigators believe that Muzammil and Umar transported the weapons and ammonium nitrate to Faridabad in the 30 to 40 days preceding the blast, possibly bringing them from Jammu & Kashmir, which raises concerns about potential cross-border links.“Even after Muzammil’s arrest on Oct 30, it’s unfortunate that the agencies failed to prevent the Delhi blast, which occurred 10 days later,” a source said. Faridabad police have set up an additional 180 checkpoints across the city in the aftermath of the blast.","Evidence allegedly recovered from room 13 (where Muzammil Ganaie lived) and Umar Un Nabi’s room (No. 4) points towards an elaborate terror plot.

Russian Troops On Two-Wheelers Storm Pokrovsk As Ukrainian Defences Collapse; Drones Hit Kharkiv

Zelenskyy orders ministerial shake-up





Inside “Operation Midas”

Mindich’s alleged role

European Union reacts

Impact on war effort and western trust





Ukraine is grappling with one of its most damaging corruption scandals since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion, as investigators uncover an alleged $100 million kickback scheme involving top officials and the state-owned nuclear power company Energoatom.The revelations come as renewed Russian strikes cripple Ukraine’s energy grid, causing rolling blackouts ahead of winter.As per news agency AP, anti-corruption watchdogs accused senior figures in government and business of embezzling funds through inflated contracts and bribes. The findings, based on a 15-month investigation involving over 1,000 hours of wiretaps, led to the arrest of five people and charges against several others.In response to growing outrage, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for the dismissal of justice minister Herman Halushchenko and energy minister Svitlana Grynchuk.Prime Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko later confirmed both had submitted their resignations.Zelenskyy also announced sanctions against businessman Timur Mindich, a close associate and co-owner of his Kvartal 95 media company.“This is a matter of trust,” Zelenskyy said in a video statement on Telegram, pledging full cooperation with the investigation.According to Politico, Zelenskyy also stressed the need for “the inevitability of punishment” in corruption cases, saying that “any effective action against corruption is very necessary.”According to Ukraine’s National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU), the operation, code-named ‘Midas’, exposed a network of businessmen and government officials who manipulated Energoatom contracts to extract kickbacks worth 10–15% of their value.The money was allegedly laundered through a Kyiv office. NABU tapes also revealed coded conversations where officials discussed blackmail and pressure tactics against contractors.Among those implicated are former deputy prime minister Oleksiy Chernyshov, identified under the codename “Che Guevara,” and former Energoatom security head Dmytro Basov.NABU alleges Chernyshov received about $1.2 million and €100,000 through the scheme, while Basov denies any wrongdoing.As per AP, the recordings suggest part of the money was directed to high-ranking officials.NABU has also accused eight individuals of bribery, abuse of office, and possession of disproportionate assets.Mindich, a long-time Zelenskyy associate, is believed to have used his influence across multiple industries, including Ukraine’s booming drone production sector.As per Politico, he fled to Israel before being charged, allegedly after being tipped off about the investigation. NABU is now probing how he learned of the charges in advance.Mindich’s companies, including drone manufacturer Fire Point, have been accused of winning government contracts without open competition.The company denies any links to Mindich or involvement in corruption.EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas was quoted as saying by news agency Reuters that the latest revelations were “extremely unfortunate,” adding, “There is no room for corruption, especially now … it is literally the people’s money that should go to the front lines.”She urged Kyiv to act “very fast and take it very seriously.”Earlier this year, the European Union had frozen $1.7 billion in aid after Zelenskyy approved a bill weakening the independence of anti-corruption agencies such as NABU and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office.The legislation sparked protests and warnings from EU officials that Ukraine must align with the bloc’s governance standards before aid is released.The scandal strikes a heavy blow to Ukraine’s credibility as its forces retreat under intensified Russian attacks.Lawmakers and analysts warn that corruption at such a level could erode Western trust and jeopardise aid. “It looks really bad in the eyes of our European and American partners,” said Oleksandr Merezhko, a lawmaker from Zelenskyy’s party, as cited by AP.Political analyst Oleh Saakian said the scheme involved “millions, tens of millions of dollars,” warning that while not the largest in Ukraine’s history, its timing during wartime makes it particularly damaging.Despite the crisis, anti-corruption bodies have been praised for their independence. “No one is above the law,” Merezhko said, adding that the investigation shows Ukraine’s watchdogs remain effective despite political pressure.As Zelenskyy battles both Russian aggression and domestic scandals, Western allies will be watching closely to see whether Kyiv delivers on its promises of transparency and accountability.","Ukraine is grappling with one of its most damaging corruption scandals since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion.

"In overworked Japan, new PM faces backlash for starting a meeting at 3 am",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/in-overworked-japan-new-pm-faces-backlash-for-starting-a-meeting-at-3am/articleshow/125289008.cms,"File photo: Japanese PM Sanae Takaichi (Picture credit: AP)





Japan’s new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, is known as an inveterate workhorse. She often skips social gatherings and has openly rejected the idea of work-life balance.But even by Takaichi’s standards, it was surprising when she emerged from her Tokyo residence shortly after 3 am on a recent day to convene a meeting with aides ahead of an appearance before parliament.Takaichi has drawn criticism for holding the meeting, which took place on Friday and has become known in the Japanese news media as the “3 am study session.” The issue is sensitive in Japan, where there have been high-profile cases in recent years of karoshi, or “death from overwork.”Some argue that the meeting, which involved several aides and lasted about three hours, would feed into unhealthy extremes. Others said that Takaichi was placing unnecessary burdens on her staff.Yoshihiko Noda, a former prime minister who leads the main opposition party, called Takaichi’s decision to hold the meeting “crazy.” When he was Japan’s leader from 2011 to 2012, he would start work around 6 am or 7 am.“It’s fine for her to work, but she should not be getting other people involved,” he said in an interview.Takaichi, who took office last month as Japan’s prime minister — the first woman to serve in that role — has sought to clarify the circumstances of the meeting.She has said that her fax machine at home was jammed (faxes are still a mainstay of communication in Japan).She decided to go to the prime minister’s residence — she has not yet moved in — so that she could review briefing materials there ahead of a 9am budget meeting at the Diet, Japan’s Parliament.Takaichi, speaking to Parliament on Friday, acknowledged that her early-morning preparation had “caused inconvenience” to her staff. But she said it was necessary to meet so early to rewrite drafts of answers for lawmakers.Takaichi’s supporters have defended her.Some in her party, the Liberal Democratic Party, have blamed opposition lawmakers for submitting questions too late. “Even a workaholic like PM Takaichi wouldn’t want to be at work at 3 am,” Midori Matsushima, an LDP lawmaker, said.Limits on overtime, an idea that Takaichi recently endorsed. The current limit of 45 hours of overtime per month was put in place in 2019 after the death of Matsuri Takahashi, a Dentsu employee, the advertising giant, who died by suicide in 2016 after clocking over 100 hours of overtime per month.Takaichi has supported allowing people to work more overtime, saying it is an important source of income. But she has also said that it should not come at the expense of the well-being of workers.“I do not approve of overtime that leads to death from overwork,” Takaichi said at another appearance in Parliament this month. “I am concerned that a reduction in overtime pay will lead to people damaging their health by taking on unfamiliar side jobs in order to earn a living.”She promised during her campaign to scrap her work-life balance upon taking office, saying she would “work and work and work and work.”","Sanae Takaichi is known as an inveterate workhorse.

"California revokes 17,000 commercial driver's licenses for immigrants",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/california-revokes-17000-commercial-drivers-licenses-for-immigrants/articleshow/125288173.cms,"ICE Puts Illegal Indian Trucker On Notice After California Crash | ‘High On Drugs, Didn’t Brake’





California plans to revoke 17,000 commercial driver's licenses given to immigrants after the Trump administration raised concerns about people in the country illegally improperly receiving licenses to drive a semitruck or a bus. But Gov. Gavin Newsom said that isn't the reason.The licenses were revoked because state officials discovered their expiration dates went past when the drivers were legally allowed to be in the United States, based on DMV documents, the California's State Transportation Agency said.Both the Democratic governor's office and the Republican Trump administration's Transportation Department agreed that these licenses violated the existing standard that were in place before Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy recently tightened the rules following a nationwide commercial driver's license audit launched after a driver in the country illegally made a U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people.Fatal truck crashes in Texas and Alabama earlier this year also highlight questions about these licenses. A fiery California crash involving an illegal immigrant truck driver last month that killed three more people only added to the concerns.Duffy said Wednesday that California's action to revoke these licenses is an admission that the state had acted improperly even though the state had previously defended its licensing standards.California launched its review of commercial driver's licenses the state had issued after Duffy raised concerns.Duffy previously imposed new restrictions on which immigrants can qualify for one of these commercial driver's licenses. He said earlier this fall that California and five other states had improperly issued commercial driver's licenses to noncitizens, but California is the only state Duffy has taken action against because it was the first one where an audit was completed. The reviews in the other states have been delayed by the government shutdown, but the Transportation Department is urging all of them to tighten up their standards.Duffy revoked $40 million in federal funding because he said California isn't enforcing English language requirements for truckers, and he reiterated Wednesday that he will take another $160 million from the state over these improperly issued licenses if they don't invalidate every illegal license and address all the concerns. But revoking these licenses is part of the state's effort to comply.""After weeks of claiming they did nothing wrong, Gavin Newsom and California have been caught red-handed. Now that we've exposed their lies, 17,000 illegally issued trucking licenses are being revoked,"" Duffy said. ""This is just the tip of iceberg. My team will continue to force California to prove they have removed every illegal immigrant from behind the wheel of semitrucks and school buses.""Newsom's office said that every one of the drivers whose licenses are being revoked had valid work authorizations from the federal government.""Once again, the Sean 'Road Rules' Duffy fails to share the truth - spreading easily disproven falsehoods in a sad and desperate attempt to please his dear leader,"" Newsom's spokesman Brandon Richards said.The new rules for commercial driver's licenses that Duffy announced in September make getting commercial driver's licenses extremely hard for immigrants because only three specific classes of visa holders will be eligible. States will also have to verify an applicant's immigration status in a federal database. These licenses will be valid for up to one year unless the applicant's visa expires sooner than that.Under the new rules, only 10,000 of the 200,000 noncitizens who have commercial licenses would qualify for them, which would only be available to drivers who have an H-2a, H-2b or E-2 visa. H-2a is for temporary agricultural workers while H-2B is for temporary nonagricultural workers, and E-2 is for people who make substantial investments in a U.S. business. But the rules won't be enforced retroactively, so those 190,000 drivers will be allowed to keep their commercial licenses at least until they come up for renewal.Those new requirements were not in place at the time these 17,000 licenses were issued. But these drivers were given notices that their licenses will expire in 60 days.Duffy said in September that investigators found that one quarter of the 145 licenses they reviewed in California shouldn't have been issued. He cited four California licenses that remained valid after the driver's work permit expired - sometimes years after.Newsom's office said the state followed guidance it received from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security about issuing these licenses to noncitizens.",The licenses were revoked because state officials discovered their expiration dates went past when the drivers were legally allowed to be in the United States. The Trump administration raised concerns about people in the country illegally improperly receiving licenses to drive a semitruck or a bus. But Gov. Gavin Newsom said that isn't the reason.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125288186,imgsize-1033929,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-image.jpg"

At least 37 people were killed and 24 injured in southern Peru on Wednesday when a double-decker bus plunged into a ravine after colliding with a pickup truck, officials said.The accident in Arequipa is one of the worst in recent years in the South American nation, where road fatalities are frequent.It occurred at dawn along a stretch of the Panamericana Sur highway that connects Peru with Chile.""We have a figure of 37 fatalities...in addition to 24 injured,"" Walther Oporto, the regional health manager of Arequipa, told AFP.The death toll could rise as some people were seriously injured in the crash, he said by telephone.The double-decker bus, operated by the Llamosas company, had departed on Tuesday night from Chala, a town in Caraveli province, and was headed for Arequipa, Peru's second-largest city.It was carrying more than 60 passengers, including children and elderly people.The vehicle fell into a ravine approximately 200 meters (650 feet) deep after colliding head-on with the pickup on a bend, according to local media reports citing firefighters.The bus rolled down the ravine and ended up on a riverbank.- 'Grief to many' -Fire department spokesman Jack Paez said the rocky terrain was hampering rescue efforts involving about 30 police officers and firefighters.""This accident...has brought grief to many families,"" he told TV Peru.A priest arrived at the scene and prayed over the bodies lined up on the riverbank, according to images from the prosecutor's office.""I ask for justice, that the full weight of the law be applied to the driver of the truck"" thought to have caused the accident, a grieving relative who lost his father and brother told local media.President Jose Jeri, in a message on X, extended condolences to those affected.The truck's driver, who survived, was detained after testing possible for alcohol, police chief Olger Benavides told reporters.The bus driver was killed, the Llamosas transport company said.Deadly traffic accidents are a common occurrence in Peru due to speeding, drunk driving, poor road conditions, lack of signage and weak enforcement by authorities.The country's mountainous topography can also make driving conditions perilous.In February 2018, near the site of Wednesday's accident, 44 people were killed after a bus plunged into the river below.Last year, 3,173 deaths were recorded on Peru's roads.",At least 37 people were killed and 24 injured in southern Peru on Wednesday.

Just months after its opening, a portion of a highway bridge in China’s Sichuan province collapsed on Tuesday, giving in to a combination of a landslide and apparent structural weakness.The Hongqi bridge in Maerkang, is a 758-metre-long span on a national highway designed to improve travel between Sichuan, China’s central regions, and Tibet, Reuters reported.Footage from the scene shows debris slamming onto the bridge, with part of the span breaking away and falling into the river below. A large plume of dust rose from the collapse site as rubble scattered across the surrounding valley.The bridge was only completed earlier this year, a milestone that the contractor, Sichuan Road & Bridge Group, shared in a video posted on social media.Local authorities confirmed that the incident occurred when landslides struck a mountainside overlooking the structure.However, there were no casualties as the bridge was already closed to traffic before the collapse.Police had shut the structure on Monday afternoon after engineers spotted cracks on slopes and nearby roads, and detected shifts in the mountain terrain above the bridge. Officials in Maerkang said that the closure decision was taken as soon as the cracks and ground movement were detected, and that worsening instability on Tuesday directly led to the collapse, New York Post reported.According to the local government, conditions deteriorated rapidly the following day.On Tuesday afternoon, the weakening mountainside gave way, triggering landslides that destroyed the approach bridge and roadbed.The destroyed bridge section was part of a key highway link intended to ease travel between Sichuan, China’s interior, and the Tibetan Plateau.","A portion of a highway bridge in China's Sichuan province collapsed on Tuesday, giving in to a combination of a landslide and apparent structural weakness.

Nikki Haley Warns Donald Trump of ‘Strategic Disaster’ as 50% US Tariff on India Nears Deadline





Amid the ongoing Christian-Hinduism controversy, Nalin Haley , the son of former US ambassador to UN Nikki Haley, has spoken about his unique journey in finding his faith in a multi-faith family. In an interview with UnHerd, the 24-year-old Indian-origin MAGA voice said he was confused over religion in his childhood. His maternal grandparents who were almost his surrogate parents, followed Sikhism while his parents were Protestant Christians.Haley said he immersed himself in books on world religions to find out what he should follow when other kids of his age were reading about cars and dinosaurs. Eventually, he concluded that Christianity is the true faith but the conclusion was preceded by a spiritual experience that he did not detail in the interview.“I needed to research my own faith better in terms of the history, the early beliefs, the Church Fathers,” he said. “When I did that, I felt as though anyone who does that kind of research will walk away a Catholic.”The interview comes as Hindu Indian-origin politicians in the US are facing unprecedented attacks over their religion. Vice President JD Vance recently said he would like to see his wife Usha Vance converted to Christianity.Though JD clarified that Usha Vance has no intention of converting, the episode showed how MAGA is Christian nationalists at core and unapologetic about it.Haley said he chose his political path too in a similar fashion. I was not just going to have the same political views as my parents,” he said adding that he supported Nikki Haley in the 2024 Republican primary only to be a ""good son"". “I didn’t and was never going to be an advocate for a view that I did not have,"" he said. Like he thinks the US should stop legal immigration as well, though he himself belongs to an immigrant family.","Nalin Haley, the son of former US ambassador to UN Nikki Haley, has spoken about his unique journey in finding his faith in a multi-faith family.

What Trump said?





The US is all set to vote on the fate of the Jeffrey Epstein case files next week, Speaker Mike Johnson announced to reporters on Wednesday.“We’re going to put that on the floor for a full vote when we get back next week,” Johnson said. “In the meantime I’ll remind everybody the [House] Oversight Committee has been working around the clock” on its own investigation, the Speaker said, as per CNN.Johnson was required to put the bill from Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna and GOP Rep. Thomas Massie on the floor once their discharge petition reached 218 signatures.Rep. Adelita Grijalva, D-Ariz., provided the 218th signature needed to approve the so-called discharge petition shortly after she was sworn in as a House member, following a seven-week delay, as per Politico.The Trump administration had faced criticism for reneging on promises to release investigative files related to Epstein, a convicted sex offender who killed himself in 2019 after his arrest on child sex-trafficking charges. Epstein had been a friend of President Donald Trump for years before they had a falling out in the early 2000s. Even if the effort passed in the House, it was unlikely to become law. The bill would have to pass in the Republican-controlled Senate, and Trump could veto it even if it survived a vote in that chamber.The New York Times reported Wednesday that Rep. Lauren Boebert, a Colorado Republican, was summoned to the White House to meet with top Justice Department and FBI officials as Trump tried to head off the House vote, The New York Times reported. Boebert is just one of four GOP House members who signed the discharge petition on the Epstein files. files.Earlier on Wednesday House Democrats released more than 20,000 documents obtained from Epstein’s estate under a subpoena. The documents include emails and text messages in which Epstein talked about Trump.“I know how dirty Donald is,” Epstein wrote in a 2018 email thread for Kathryn Ruemmler, who served as former President Barack Obama’s White House counsel, after she sent Epstein an article about Trump’s ex-personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen’s pleading guilty to campaign finance violations and agreeing to cooperate in a federal investigation of the president.In a separate April 2019 email released by Democrats, Epstein told author Michael Wolff that Trump “knew about the girls.” It is unclear what the phrase “knew about the girls” meant. In another newly released email that Epstein wrote to his now-convicted accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell in April 2011, Epstein wrote, “I want you to realize that the dog that hasn’t barked is trump.” Epstein added in that same email that a person whom the Democrats identified as a victim of his, whose name was redacted in the email, “spent hours at my house with” Trump. “He has never once been mentioned,” Epstein added in that message.It is not clear what Epstein was referring to in the email that said “the dog that hasn’t barked.” CNBC has not independently verified the documents released by the Democrats.White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Democrats “selectively leaked emails” to “create a fake narrative to smear President Trump.”She was responding to the presence of an email in which Jeffrey Epstein said Trump “spent hours at my house” with one of his victims.Leavitt said that Trump “kicked out” Epstein from his Florida club for being a “pedophile” as well as a “creep”. She added, “What President Trump has always said is that he was from Palm Beach, and so was Jeffrey Epstein. Jeffrey Epstein was a member at Mar-a-Lago until President Trump kicked him out because Jeffrey Epstein was a pedophile and he was a creep.”Trump has denied having known about Epstein’s sexual abuse of underage girls and young women when they were socialising with each other. The President has never been charged with wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.Trump blasted the Democrats in a Truth Social post that accused them of using the Epstein documents to distract Americans from the cost of the US govt shutdown.“The Democrats are trying to bring up the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax again because they’ll do anything at all to deflect on how badly they’ve done on the Shutdown, and so many other subjects,” Trump wrote.“Only a very bad, or stupid, Republican would fall into that trap,” he wrote. “The Democrats cost our Country $1.5 Trillion Dollars with their recent antics of viciously closing our Country, while at the same time putting many at risk — and they should pay a fair price,” Trump said.“There should be no deflections to Epstein or anything else, and any Republicans involved should be focused only on opening up our Country, and fixing the massive damage caused by the Democrats!”","The US is set to vote on the fate of the Jeffrey Epstein case files next week.

US Shutdown: Deadlock soon to end as Senate set to vote — but when will SNAP benefits resume?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-shutdown-deadlock-soon-to-end-as-senate-set-to-vote-but-when-will-snap-benefits-resume/articleshow/125287630.cms,"Shutdown Chaos: Angry McGovern Throws Paper, Then Hammers GOP During Tense House Panel Hearing

When will SNAP benefits resume?









The US House of Representatives, which was on break since mid-September, is set to cast votes and end the record-breaking government shutdown. With this, millions of Americans who rely on federal food aid are also about to get the benefits, but the question is, when?Roughly one in eight Americans depends on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which saw new disbursements frozen for two weeks amid Washington’s political gridlock. Now, as federal agencies race to restart services, food banks report persistent demand and widespread confusion — a stark reminder of how easily safety-net programs can be disrupted when Congress stalls.According to the administration, millions of low-income Americans will receive their full food aid benefits within 24 hours of President Donald Trump signing Congress’s shutdown-ending deal into law.Once the government is open, most states will get the funds to distribute benefits “within 24 hours,” USDA spokesperson Alec Varsamis said in a statement Wednesday, Politico reported.The House is expected to pass the funding package and send it to Trump’s desk Wednesday night. The deal would restore the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the nation’s largest anti-hunger initiative, to its original spending levels.The resumed SNAP payments would be a relief for the nearly 42 million people who have experienced major disruptions to their typical monthly benefits during the record-breaking shutdown, as the Trump administration has battled states, nonprofits and cities in court over how much money to release.The programme lapsed for the first time on November 1, leaving food banks and state officials scrambling to meet rising hunger needs just ahead of the holiday season.USDA started delivering up to 65 percent of partial benefits last week after a federal judge ordered the department to tap a contingency fund to keep SNAP afloat. But the Trump administration appealed a separate order to pay for full November benefits to the Supreme Court, which has yet to weigh in and likely will not if lawmakers end the shutdown this week.Even after the govt is open, however, some states could see delays in returning SNAP benefit issuances to normal levels, given that they have paused their typical processes for readying the funds due to the shutdown, anti-hunger groups argue.","The US House of Representatives is set to pass a bill to end the government shutdown.

In an unusual moment, Trump presented Sharaa with a bottle of Trump perfume.“This is men’s fragrance, here,” Trump said to a laughing Sharaa. He sprayed the scent on the Syrian president and added, “It’s the best fragrance.” He then joked, “The other [perfume] is for your wife.
