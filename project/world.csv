Hindu-Muslim unity & amity were last wish of Kakori martyrs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hindu-muslim-unity-amity-were-last-wish-of-kakori-martyrs/articleshow/112436664.cms,"HRA embraced Marxist Socialism



Movement fortified



Compelled Congress to reinvent



The Kakori Train Action not only shook the foundation of the British Raj but also brought into limelight the camaraderie between a staunch Hindu and a dutiful Muslim. That pious bond between Pandit Ram Prasad Bismil and Ashfaqullah Khan trumped the British govt’s favourite tool of ‘divide and rule’.“The message given by Kakori Action was much bigger than the action it spoke for.It sent ripples of Hindu-Muslim unity among people and the powers that be,” says Prof Sushil Pandey, a faculty member at the department of history, Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University (BBAU).A few days before his hanging, Bismil poured his heart out in a letter, urging the people of the country to commit themselves to Hindu-Muslim unity if they had an iota of respect for the sacrifice being made by him and others. Citing Ashfaqullah as a case in point, Bismil also trashed the notion that “Muslims aren’t trustworthy” and asked Hindus and Muslims to work together for the nation’s freedom.“Sarkar ne Ashfaqullah ko Ram Prasad ka dahina haath karaar diya. Ashfaqullah kattar musalman hokar pakke Arya Samaji Ram Prasad ke krantikari dal ke sambandh mein yadi dahina haath bante, tab kya naye Bharatvarsh ki swatantrata ke naam par Hindu Musalman apne niji chhote chhote fayedon ka khayal na kar ke aapas mein ek nahi ho sakte? (Govt has called Ashfaqullah the right hand of Ram Prasad Bismil. If a staunch Muslim Ashfaqullah can work as the right hand of Arya Samaj follower Ram Prasad Bismil, why can’t Hindus and Muslims shun their vested interests and unite for the cause of freedom),” Bismil wrote.“Main toh apna karya kar chuka. Maine Musalmanon mein se ek navyuvak nikalkar Bharatvasiyon ko dikhla diya – jo sab parikshaon mein poorna utteerna hua. Ab kisi ko yeh kehne ka sahas na hona chahiye ki Musalman par vishwas na karna chahiye (I have done my bit. I emerged as a youth from among the Muslims who showed to people of India that he cleared all the tests with flying colours. No one will now have the courage to say that one cannot trust Muslims),” he added.Shaheed-e-Azam Bhagat Singh had also penned an essay titled ‘The Last Message of the Martyr of the Nation Shri Ram Prasad Bismil’, published in Kirti in Jan 1928, under the pseudonym ‘Vidrohi’.Citing one of the letters by Bismil, he wrote: “Now my only request to the countrymen is that if they feel sorry at our death, then, with whatever means, they must establish Hindu-Muslim unity; that was our last wish and only this can be our memorial. Whatever I am saying, same is the opinion of Ashfaqullah Khan Warsi. At the time of making the appeal, I talked to him in Lucknow.”Experts are also of the view that the bond between Bismil and Ashfaq became a template and ready reference to counter the divide and rule policy of the British.“Since the revolutionaries were young, their bravery resonated well with the youth whose energy eventually drove the freedom movement in subsequent years,” he said, adding that the years in 1920s and 1930s, had established the revolutionary might of the youth.The main takeaway from the World War I (1914-18) and Russian Revolution (1917-23) was that youth drove revolutions and that labour class and peasants were crucial stakeholders. The opinion had many takers in India as well.Historians are of the view that the simmering sentiment fueled the success of Mahatma Gandhi’s Non-Cooperation Movement. The energy lost its direction with the campaign’s abrupt end after Chauri Chaura violence, but it ignited many Muslims who were lent a face by Ashfaqullah Khan.References establish that the British made serious efforts to convince both Bismil and Ashfaqullah to become approvers. While Bismil was told that he would be saved from death penalty and sent to a foreign land with an allowance, Ashfaqullah was told that Hindustan Republican Alliance (HRA) was a Hindu outfit and that as a Muslim he had no place in it.In his autobiography, Bismil has detailed how British secret services officers played divisive tactics during their visits.The Hindustan Republican Association started as an organization that aimed to establish a federated republic of the United States of India by an organized and armed revolution. After Kakori Train Action, HRA reorganized its tenets and embraced Marxist socialism – a nationalist thought popular in those days. And so, HRA rechristened as Hindustan Socialist Republican Association ( HSRA ).Under Chandrashekhar Azad ’s leadership, all young revolutionaries, Bejoy Kumar Sinha, Shiv Varma, Jaidev Kapur, Bhagat Singh, Bhagwati Charan Vohra, and Sukhdev met at Feroz Shah Kotla ground in Delhi on Sep 8-9, 1928, and reorganized HRA into HSRA. The idea of socialism was introduced and included as a main objective by Bhagat Singh so that India doesn’t just attain political freedom but also economic self-reliance.HSRA became aligned with the movements of farmers and workers. In his book, ‘Modern India’, historian Sumit Sarkar wrote: “Bhagat Singh’s transition to Marxism must be placed in the context of what was in some ways the most striking feature of 1928-29 – a massive labour upsurge (particularly in the railways, cotton textiles and jute).”Marxist influence on HSRA also created a ripple effect and provided an impetus to young socialist leadership in the Congress which dominated Congress in coming years, including post-Independence till mid ’70s.In his autobiography, Ram Prasad Bismil has mentioned that in Kakori Action, three bags of money (bonds) were collected. The money was used to settle all loans of HRA. An amount of Rs 1,000 was invested for procurement of more weapons and the remaining was invested to relocate the heads of different HRA centres from UP to safer places in other states.In the meeting of HSRA, Azad was appointed the ‘Commander of the military division’ whose aim was to free India from the British through an organized armed struggle. However, the leadership also decided to move away from ‘individual heroic actions’ and focus on mass politics and collective action.In Dec 1928, Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev avenged the death of Lala Lajpat Rai in police lathi charge by killing JP Saunders, assistant superintendent of police, Lahore.Likewise, on April 8, 1929, Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt threw bombs in the legislative assembly while discussion was on in the Assembly on the Anti-Labour Trades Disputes Bill and a bill to bar British communists and other supporters of Indian independence from coming to India.Citing references from various sources, Prof Pandey said that the Kakori Action compelled the Congress to take a fresh look at their efforts for India’s independence.Stating that Bismil was a member of the Congress and had even attended meetings related to the Lucknow Pact, besides being part of a voluntary reception committee given to Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Prof Pandey said: “From the days of its Kolkata Convention (1906), the Congress party had been pushing the idea of ‘swaraj’ (self-rule) but the party had not defined what it actually meant by it. The Kakori case became a turning point which compelled it to reinvent its ideology and leadership.”In its Lahore Convention (1929), for the first time, Congress pitched for ‘poorna swaraj’ and ‘internal and external sovereignty’. The party also appointed young Jawaharlal Nehru as its president to resonate with the youth,” he said.In the subsequent years, the Congress also formed the All-India Kisan Congress in solidarity with farmers who were also suffering at the hands of the British.Bismil also urged members from different political parties to shun differences and unite under the banner of the Congress to exert pressure on the British. He also wrote a letter to Congress leaders to invite representatives from different walks of life and religions in the party’s Madras Conference.",Ram Prasad Bismil and Ashfaqullah Khan were close friends. The bond between the two was used to counter the British divide and rule policy. The Kakori Train Action also brought into limelight the camaraderie between a staunch Hindu and a dutiful Muslim.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112436694,imgsize-205296,width-400,resizemode-4/112436694.jpg"

KOLKATA: A volunteer who works alongside Kolkata Police personnel was arrested Saturday for the rape and murder of a second-year postgraduate trainee doctor at the city’s RG Kar Hospital the previous day.Sanjay Roy was held barely six hours after a seven-member special investigation team (SIT) was set up. The 35-yearold was produced in a local court, where no lawyer agreed to represent him.The court sent Roy to 14 days’ police custody after the public prosecutor likened the assault on the 31-yearold doctor to the 2012 Nirbhaya case.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee said “if needed, the accused will be hanged”.Roy is a civic volunteer. Such volunteers help cops in non-law enforcement roles and, while they are paid by the state, they are not officially part of the force.Recruited in 2019, Roy had on multiple occasions been posted at RG Kar Hospital’s police outpost and, therefore, had easy access to every department. What gave him away was a torn earphone found in the seminar room on the third floor of the emergency building where the doctor’s body was found early Friday.CCTV footage showed Roy entering the emergency building at 4am with a Bluetooth device plugged into his ears. When he exited the building 40 minutes later, the earphone was missing. The device later paired with his cellphone, cops said.The postmortem report late Friday confirmed sexual assault on the doctor. The report said there were multiple signs of injuries and struggle on the body -bloodstains on the face, eyes and face, scratch marks and wounds in the private parts. A collar bone was broken.“We arrested the accused due to his strong complicity in the case based on items collected from the spot and CCTV footage,” Kolkata police com- missioner Vineet Goyal said.Investigations revealed the doctor was asleep when Roy attacked her.She and her two juniors ordered food post-midnight and at least five doctors had dinner together in the seminar room while watching Neeraj Chopra win silver in the Olympics. Post-dinner, the others left while she decided to study and rest for a while.According to sources, she was spotted sleeping in the seminar room at least till 3am.Roy, sources said, first entered the RG Kar Hospital premises around 11pm. He was intoxicated.He left the hospital complex soon and reportedly drank some more. Around 4am, he was seen entering the emergency building. CCTV footage showed five others had accessed the area but only Roy could not explain his presence.He later confessed to the crime and admitted throttling the doctor after she put up a struggle.Waves of protests engulfed RG Kar all through Saturday even as junior doctors, house staff and interns in other city hospitals stayed away from work demanding better security and exemplary punishment for the accused.In her first reaction to the crime, the CM called it “despicable” and said the young doctor’s death felt “like a personal loss”.“I have directed it to be taken to a fast-track court. If needed, the accused will be hanged. Though I am not pro-capital punishment, he should be given the strictest punishment,” Mamata told a news channel. She made it clear she had no objections if the doctor’s family demanded a probe by a central agency.","Sanjay Roy was held barely six hours after a seven-member special investigation team (SIT) was set up.

MUMBAI: A sessions court acquitted a couple who had spent seven years in jail on charges of murdering the woman’s husband in 2017. The court pointed out that the probe was flawed and marked by negligence on the part of the investigating officer, which ultimately led to the couple being given the benefit of the doubt and acquitted.The body of Sachin Chari was found on their building terrace in 2017.It was alleged that accused Chetan Waghela and Sonali Chari killed him as he was a hurdle to his wife’s freedom. But the judge said prosecution had not produced evidence to show they were romantically involved. CDR of the two were not collected to show their connection.The couple’s then 12-year-old child’s allegations about her mother’s affair proved insufficient as evidence.The court noted it wasn’t established if the child knew Waghela. The child in her statement, had taken names of other men, one of them whose photo was the display picture of her mother’s phone and another who she claimed she was going to marry. The judge questioned why none of these men were investigated.“The IO has not collected CDR of mobile phones of accused 1 (Sonali) and 2 (Waghela) to show their interconnection. Thereby, there is no evidence to prove criminal conspiracy allegedly hatched between accused and the motive to commit the offence,” additional sessions judge Aditee Uday Kadam said.While a witness had claimed that the accused had confessed to him about the murder on a call when he was on the run, neither his cell nor the memory card on which it was recorded were seized by cops. The judge said that the IO hadn’t taken pains in probing the case by following due procedure of law.“He failed to collect relevant evidence available in the form of CDR and mobile or electronic evidence. He failed to follow procedure to collect electronic evidence or memory card. He has not recorded the statement of material witnesses though they were available with him since inception,” the judge observed.",The body of Sachin Chari was found on their building terrace in 2017.

NEW DELHI: Taking a swipe at the Congress , Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar on Saturday cautioned the nation against the efforts of ""anti-national forces"" trying to infuse a narrative that India is bound to face a fate similar to the recent events in its neighborhood, including Bangladesh .Dhankhar expressed deep concern over how certain individuals, despite being former Members of Parliament and having served in the Foreign Service, are quick to draw parallels between India and its neighboring countries.He emphasized that such statements are highly unpatriotic and aimed at misleading the public.""Be on watch out!! Efforts by some to infuse a narrative that what happened in our neighbourhood is bound to happen in our Bharat, is deeply concerning. How can a citizen of this country having been a Member of Parliament, and the other who has seen enough of Foreign Service takes no time in saying that what happened in the neighbourhood will happen in India!,"" the VP said on X.Speaking at the platinum jubilee celebrations of the Rajasthan High Court in Jodhpur, Dhankhar also lambasted those who are exploiting India's constitutional institutions to hide or legitimize their actions.He accused these forces of using these platforms to set afloat narratives intended to derail the nation and its democracy.On August 6, Congress leader Salman Khurshid had said that though ""everything may look normal on the surface"", what is happening in Bangladesh could happen in India.Dhankhar also lauded the judiciary's steadfast commitment to the rule of law, while also reflecting on the Emergency period imposed in June 1975 by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.While describing the era of Emergency as ""the draconian darkest period"" since Independence, Dhankhar expressed concern that during this time, even the highest levels of the judiciary, typically a ""formidable citadel of basic rights,"" yielded to the ""brazen dictatorial regime"".""The highest court ruled that no one could move any court for enforcement of rights as long as the emergency lasted,"" the Vice President remarked, pointing out the severe implications of this ruling on the liberties of countless citizens.""Liberty was held to ransom by an individual, and thousands across the country were arrested without any fault except that they believed in Bharat Maa and nationalism at heart,"" he added.Jagdeep Dhankhar praised the courage of nine High Courts during this dark chapter, particularly the High Court of Rajasthan.","Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar takes a swipe at the Congress.

The nation, Centre, state, everyone, is with them. While we cannot replace the lives that have been lost, we should all try to ensure the future and dreams of those who survived are not shattered.In a meeting at the district collectorate here to review the situation and work out a plan for the rehabilitation of victims, Modi asserted that Centre would spare no effort in assisting with relief and rehabilitation activities. As soon as the state govt submits details about the building of houses, schools, roads, infrastructure and securing the future of survivors, especially children who lost their parents, “there will be full cooperation from our end,” he said. “Centre will stand with Kerala govt. I do not believe any work will be stopped due to lack of funds,” the PM added.Modi said even though his “heart was heavy” on hearing about the disaster, he came to Wayanad now as he did not want to hinder the rescue and relief activities earlier. He said he saw everything in detail and that it was easier to make decisions “when you have first-hand information”.Modi said he could understand the condition of the survivors here as he had seen a similar disaster in 1979 in Gujarat’s Morbi, when an earthen dam was destroyed in rains, flooding the city with 10-12 feet of water. Over 2,500 people had lost their lives.After the meeting, CMO issued a statement saying Vijayan asked the PM for financial support for rehabilitation and help to combat climate change. The CM also handed over a note of the extent of the damage to Modi, and pointed out that according to the preliminary assessment, the damage was to the tune of thousands of crores of rupees.

Judiciary coup?



Students besieged premises



Chief justice Obaidul Hassan of the Bangladesh Supreme Court resigned from his position on Saturday, following protests by students who demanded the resignation of the chief justice and judges of the Appellate Division by 1 pm, as reported by media outlets.""I feel it is necessary to share a special news with you. Our chief justice has resigned a few minutes back.His resignation letter has already reached the law ministry. We will send it to the president without delay for taking necessary measures,"" Asif Nazrul, law, justice and parliamentary affairs adviser to the interim government, said in a facebook post.Obaidul Hassan, the chief justice of the Supreme Court, was instructed to resign by demonstrators who assembled near the court building in Dhaka, the nation's capital. Hassan, who was selected to lead the Supreme Court last year, is perceived as a Hasina loyalist.The protests in Bangladesh were initially sparked after the high court reinstated a job quota system that allocated a substantial portion of government jobs to certain groups, including 30% for descendants of veterans from the 1971 liberation war.This decision was viewed as favoring supporters of the ruling Awami League party, which has been in power since 2009. The reinstatement of these quotas, which had been abolished in 2018 due to widespread protests, ignited anger among students and job seekers who felt that merit-based opportunities were being denied to them.On July 4, chief justice Obaidul Hasan had made remarks during the hearing of the Appellate Division on the high court verdict on quota saying, “Why have so many movements begun on streets? Will you change the verdicts of the high court and the Supreme by exerting pressure through the movement?”Initially, chief justice Hassan called for a full court meeting with all justices from both divisions of the Supreme Court. However, the protesting students perceived this as a judiciary coup and announced their intention to besiege the High Court premises. In response to the student protest, Chief Justice Hassan postponed the meeting and later announced his decision to step down.The chief justice announced his decision after protesters from the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement gathered at the court premises. Hasnat Abdullah, a coordinator of the movement, issued an ultimatum calling for the resignation of the chief justice and the justices of the Appellate Division, threatening to besiege their residences if their demands were not met, as reported by The Daily Star.Asif Nazrul, serving as the law advisor to the interim government, addressed journalists at the Secretariat. ""We hope the chief justice will understand when a demand for resignation comes from the mass movement and how to honour that demand,"" Prothomolo quoted Nazrul as saying.As hundreds of protesting students gathered at the Supreme Court premises, Bangladesh Army personnel were deployed to maintain order.The army personnel were stationed in the main building, annexe building, and other areas around the Supreme Court. They urged the protesters to maintain peace and refrain from damaging government property.Following the resignation of prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who fled to India on Monday amid political turmoil in Bangladesh, 84-year-old Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus was sworn in as the head of an interim government on Thursday.His government is expected to announce fresh elections after restoring law and order, following the deadly anti-government demonstrations against the Hasina government that had led to widespread violence, which is now subsiding.","Chief justice Obaidul Hassan of the Bangladesh Supreme Court resigned from his position on Saturday.

Members of minority communities in Bangladesh faced at least 205 incidents of attacks in 52 districts since the fall of the Sheikh Hasina-led government on August 5, according to two Hindu organisations -- Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council and the Bangladesh Puja Udjapan Parishad -- in the country.Thousands of Bangladeshi Hindus have been trying to flee to neighbouring India to escape the violence.Reaching out to students who are at the forefront of the protests, Yunus, a Nobel laureate, cautioned them not to let their efforts be sabotaged by those seeking to undermine their progress, the Dhaka Tribune newspaper reported.""There are many standing by to make your efforts futile. Don't fail this time,"" he said while addressing the students at the Begum Rokeya University in Rangpur city.Yunus unequivocally condemned the attacks on minority communities in the country, calling the acts ""heinous"".He urged the students to protect all Hindu, Christian, and Buddhist families from harm.""Are they not the people of this country? You have been able to save the country; can't you save some families?...You must say - no one can harm them. They are my brothers; we fought together, and we will stay together,"" he asserted, underscoring the need for national unity.Stressing the importance of youth leadership, Yunus said, ""This Bangladesh, is now in your hands. You have the power to take it wherever you want. This isn't a matter of research - it's a power within you.""He also urged the people of Bangladesh to emulate the way student activist Abu Sayed stood valiantly during the anti-government demonstrations that led to the toppling of the Sheikh Hasina government.Sayed, 25, of Rangpur's Begum Rokeya University, was among the first protesters to be killed in police firing on July 16 during the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement.Yunus, who was sworn in on Thursday as the head of the interim government, met with Sayed's family members in Rangpur's Pirganj upazila, The Daily Star newspaper reported.""We have to stand the way Abu Sayed stood...Abu Sayeed's mother is everyone's mother. We have to protect her, protect her sisters, protect her brothers. Everyone has to do it together,"" he told reporters after meeting Sayed's family.Yunus said that the responsibility of building a new Bangladesh is for every Bangladeshi.""We will remember him (Abu Sayed) through this. Therefore, we should ensure that we do the work (needed),"" he said.""Abu Sayed is no longer a member of just one family. He is the child of all families in Bangladesh. The children who will grow up and attend school and college will know about Abu Sayed and will say to themselves, 'I too will fight for justice.' Abu Sayed is now in every home,"" Yunus said.Meanwhile, thousands of Hindu agitators, including students, blocked the Shahbagh intersection for the second consecutive day on Saturday, protesting attacks on their homes, shops, and temples in various parts of the country, The Daily Star newspaper reported.They shouted slogans such as ""Save the Hindus,"" ""Why are my temples and homes being looted? We want answers,"" ""Hindu persecution in independent Bangladesh, it will not continue,"" ""Religion is for individuals, the state is for everyone,"" and ""Ensure the safety of Hindus"".A number of Hindu temples, households and businesses were vandalised, women assaulted and at least two Hindu leaders affiliated with the Awami League party headed by Hasina were killed in the violence in Bangladesh after she fled the country, according to community leaders in Dhaka.The protesters warned that if immediate measures are not taken to stop the persecution of Hindus, they will go for continuous protest programmes.They also demanded the formation of a ministry for minorities, the establishment of a minority protection commission, the enactment and implementation of strict laws to prevent all forms of attacks on minorities, and the allocation of 10 per cent of parliamentary seats for minorities.In another major development, Bangladesh's Chief Justice Obaidul Hassan and five other top judges on Saturday tendered their resignations, five days after the fall of the Hasina regime amid massive street protests and students marching towards the apex court demanding a revamp of the judiciary.The 65-year-old top judge revealed his decision around 1 pm after protesters of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement gathered at the apex court premises. The students had issued an ultimatum to him and the judges of the Appellate Division to resign by 1 pm""I feel it is necessary to share a special news with you. Our chief justice resigned a few minutes back. His resignation letter has already reached the law ministry,"" law adviser, equivalent to the minister of the newly-installed interim government, Prof Asif Nazrul said in a Facebook video message.Appellate Division Justice Md Ashfaqul Islam has been appointed as the acting chief justice following Hassan's resignation, Supreme Court's Public Relations Officer Md Shafiqul Islam told the media.Several other top officials, including Dhaka University Vice-Chancellor Professor Dr Maksud Kamal and Bangla Academy Director General Professor Dr Md Harun-Ur-Rashid Askari, resigned from their posts in the wake of new protests by students and other demonstrators.","Bangladesh's interim leader Muhammad Yunus condemns attacks on the minority communities.

Its decisions are final and binding,"" according to Reuters.The high court is widely believed to be loyal to the government of Nicolas Maduro , who has claimed a narrow victory in the election. However, opposition leaders maintain that their candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, won by a significant margin and have presented what they claim to be official tallies from voting sites as proof.Maduro himself called upon the high court on August 1 to ""validate"" his victory, which has been questioned both domestically and internationally. The court heard from all candidates this week, except for Gonzalez Urrutia, who has expressed fear of arrest. He has not made any public appearances in over a week, while key opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, a former presidential candidate who was barred from running this time, has stated that she is living in hiding.In a video posted on social media, Gonzalez Urrutia called on Maduro to end ""violence and persecution,"" referring to post-election protests that, according to rights groups, resulted in 24 deaths.Maduro has reported that 2,200 people have been arrested, and two members of security forces have been killed, reported Reuters.Gonzalez Urrutia appealed, ""I ask you on behalf of all Venezuelans to put an end to the violence and persecution and to immediately release all compatriots arbitrarily detained,"" adding, ""Demanding respect for our constitution is not a crime, demonstrating peacefully to uphold the will of millions of Venezuelans is not a crime.""The National Electoral Council (CNE) ratified Maduro's victory on August 2, stating that he had won 52 percent of the vote. However, the CNE refused to release exact tallies from election sites, claiming that the data had been hacked. In contrast, the opposition published printed tallies, the legitimacy of which has been denied by Maduro, that they say show Gonzalez Urrutia receiving 67 percent of the vote.The opposition and many observers believe that the alleged hacking of the results is a government fabrication to avoid publishing election documents. Maduro rejected these accusations on Friday, claiming that there had been ""brutal"" hacking, with ""30 million attacks per minute on the electronic systems of the CNE and of Venezuela.""Opposition lawyer Perkins Rocha argued that by turning to the high court, Maduro was effectively acknowledging that ""no one believes"" the CNE, adding that ""Maduro knows he can count on a (court) that kneels before him.""During his time in office, Maduro has presided over a national collapse, including an 80 percent drop in the GDP of the once-wealthy oil-rich country, due to domestic economic mismanagement and international sanctions.

The playful yet critical comparisons highlight the turbulent state of Trump’s campaign, which has faced increasing challenges since Kamala Harris replaced President Joe Biden as the Democratic presidential candidate.Trump’s campaign, which was previously seen as a strong contender for the White House, has been under pressure following Biden’s withdrawal from the race on July 21. Harris, who has gained momentum since Biden’s departure, announced Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her vice-presidential running mate, further strengthening her bid.Released on Dion’s album Let’s Talk About Love and the Titanic soundtrack, “My Heart Will Go On” became a global phenomenon, selling 18 million copies and earning Dion an Oscar, a Golden Globe, and several Grammys. Despite recent health issues that led her to cancel tour dates for 2023 and 2024 due to an autoimmune disorder, Dion made headlines last month by performing from the Eiffel Tower at the Paris Olympics opening.The controversy over the song underscores the ongoing challenges and scrutiny facing both Trump and Harris as the 2024 presidential race heats up.","Dion’s management team and Sony Music Entertainment Canada issued a statement on X, clarifying that the use of the song and video was “in no way’ authorized. “Celine Dion does not endorse this or any similar use… And really, THAT song?” the statement continued.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112437220,imgsize-1971830,width-400,resizemode-4/112437220.jpg"

"US elections: New poll shows Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-elections-new-poll-shows-kamala-harris-leading-donald-trump-in-michigan-pennsylvania-and-wisconsin/articleshow/112436790.cms,"Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris has gained a significant edge over Republican rival Donald Trump in three critical battleground states , according to a recent New York Times/Siena College poll released on Saturday. The survey indicates that Harris commands 50 percent support among voters in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, compared to Trump's 46 percent in each state.This boost for Harris comes on the heels of her campaign launch, following President Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the 2024 race last month due to concerns about his age and ability to serve another term.Since officially entering the race, Harris has secured strong backing from key Democratic voter segments, including young people and people of color, as well as significant support from donors and top party lawmakers.Harris's recent selection of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her vice-presidential running mate has further energized the Democratic ticket. However, Harris's stance on the Gaza conflict has sparked controversy. During a rally in Detroit this week, she faced protests demanding an end to the war. In response, Harris told demonstrators, ""You know what, if you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I’m speaking,” which drew criticism from Palestinian rights advocates.At a subsequent rally in Arizona, Harris adopted a more conciliatory tone amid protests over Gaza. “The president and I are working around the clock every day to get that ceasefire deal done and bring the hostages home. I respect your voices, but we are here to now talk about the race in 2024,” she stated.Advocates have urged Harris to distance herself from Biden’s strong support for Israel and end arms shipments to the ally amid ongoing conflict.On the Republican side, Trump has continued to criticize Harris and Walz. In a lengthy press conference on Thursday, Trump dismissed them as weak candidates and claimed they were already falling in the polls. He expressed regret over not facing Biden in the election, suggesting Biden was unjustly removed from the Democratic ticket. Trump’s campaign has labeled the Harris-Walz ticket as ""every American’s nightmare,"" with Trump personally attacking Harris's intelligence and background. “She’s not doing any news conferences,” Trump said. “She doesn’t know how to do a news conference. She’s not smart enough to do a news conference.”As the 2024 election approaches, the dynamics in these key battleground states will likely play a crucial role in shaping the outcome.","Harris commands 50 percent support among voters in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, compared to Trump's 46 percent in each state.

US election: Improving her odds of winning? Kamala Harris aims to solidify Nevada as key Democratic stronghold,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-election-improving-her-odds-of-winning-kamala-harris-aims-to-solidify-nevada-as-key-democratic-stronghold/articleshow/112436799.cms,"Vice President Kamala Harris is working to secure Nevada as a critical battleground state for the upcoming November election. On Saturday, Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, wrapped up a tour through key swing states with a focus on energizing voters in Nevada following President Joe Biden’s exit from the race and Harris's ascension to the top of the Democratic ticket.During the visit, Harris sought to bolster support among Latino voters , a key demographic in the state.Nevada was narrowly won by Biden in 2020 by 2.4 percentage points over Donald Trump, reported AP. This year, Trump is aiming to gain ground with promises to make workers' tips tax-free, a move targeting the state’s significant hotel, restaurant, and entertainment industries.The Culinary Workers Union , representing 60,000 workers in the hospitality sector, endorsed Harris on Friday. The union's endorsement is significant given that 54% of its members are Latino, 55% are women, and 60% are immigrants. “The path to victory runs through Nevada,” the union declared, vowing to support Harris and Walz in November.Additionally, the Adelante PAC , the political arm of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), endorsed Harris, marking a first for the 95-year-old organization. CEO Juan Proaño expressed concern about Trump’s potential return and its impact on the Latino community, emphasizing the necessity of supporting Harris.The visit also resonated with younger voters. Imer Cespedes-Alvarado, a political science major at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, noted the excitement and energy among students for Harris and Walz. “There’s an incredible energy here among the college students and community members,” he said.Harris is aiming to differentiate herself from Trump by focusing on issues like access to abortion and immigration reforms. She has criticized Trump’s handling of border security and his role in blocking a bipartisan deal on immigration, which Democrats argue was intended to boost his political standing.Trump has labeled Harris as the “worst border czar in history,” and his campaign has proposed mass deportations if he returns to the White House. However, AP VoteCast from 2020 revealed that nearly 70% of Nevada voters supported offering legal status to immigrants living in the US illegally.Support for Harris is visible across various voter groups. Krista Hall and Thaddeus Hager, attendees of the Las Vegas rally, expressed high enthusiasm for the campaign, comparing the excitement to that of Obama’s 2008 campaign. Meanwhile, in rural Douglas County, Gail Scott noted the increasing enthusiasm among younger voters, which could be pivotal in November.On the Republican side, Brian Shaw from northern Nevada noted that Harris’s candidacy could challenge Trump more than Biden’s did. He found Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance to be likable but not yet fully tested in the campaign.The Democratic ticket has been active in other critical states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona, and previously planned visits to North Carolina and Georgia, which were postponed due to Tropical Storm Debby. Nevada’s role in the electoral landscape remains crucial as Harris and Walz continue their push for voter support in key states.","Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, wrapped up a tour through key swing states on Saturday.

'I don't want to die': Fourth-grader’s chilling 911 call from Uvalde school during mass shooting,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/i-dont-want-to-die-fourth-graders-chilling-911-call-from-uvalde-school-during-mass-shooting-in-us/articleshow/112436717.cms,"Khloie Torres, a fourth-grade student at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, made a series of heart-wrenching 911 calls from inside her classroom during the shooting on May 24, 2022.“Please, I don’t want to die. My teacher is dead. Oh, my God”, Khloie could be heard saying on the call.When asked by the dispatcher if there were many people in the room with her, Khloie responded, ""No, it's just me and a couple of friends.A lot of people are,"" she says, pausing briefly, ""gone.""The release of the 911 calls, along with body camera footage and surveillance videos, came after a legal battle between Uvalde city officials and news organizations.The massacre , which claimed the lives of 19 students and two teachers at Robb elementary school, is considered one of the worst school shootings in US history. The delayed response from law enforcement , with nearly 400 officers waiting over 70 minutes before confronting the gunman, has been widely criticized as a massive failure.Families of the victims, such as Brett Cross, whose 10-year-old nephew Uziyah Garcia was killed, and Jesse Rizo, whose 9-year-old niece Jacklyn Cazares lost her life, expressed anger and frustration at the delayed release of information and the lack of accountability and transparency from authorities. They believed that a quicker response from law enforcement could have saved lives.The police response involved a significant number of officers from various agencies, including the US Border Patrol, state police, and school and city police. Despite the presence of officers in the hallway, they struggled to establish a command post and coordinate their actions, as evidenced by the radio traffic focused on setting up a perimeter and controlling traffic. It wasn't until 12:50 pm that a tactical team entered one of the classrooms and fatally shot the gunman, Salvador Ramos.Investigations by the US justice department and other agencies have revealed numerous problems in law enforcement's response, including a lack of urgency in establishing a command center, inadequate training, communication issues, and questionable prioritization of officers' lives over those of the children and teachers.Two responding officers, former Uvalde school Police Chief Pete Arredondo and former school officer Adrian Gonzales, now face criminal charges of child abandonment and endangerment, to which they have pleaded not guilty.The tragedy led to families seeking accountability through lawsuits against law enforcement, social media, online gaming companies, and the gun manufacturer responsible for the rifle used by the gunman.","Khloie Torres, a fourth-grade student at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, made a series of heart-wrenching 911 calls from inside her classroom during the shooting on May 24, 2022. “Please, I don’t want to die.

Often called ""tidal waves,"" tsunamis are among the most powerful natural disasters in recorded human history. In contrast to ordinary ocean waves, tsunamis are caused by abrupt, large-scale events in or close to a body of water, such landslides, undersea earthquakes, or volcanic eruptions. These disturbances produce waves that move across oceans with enormous force and speed, becoming taller as they get closer to shallow coastal regions.The sheer force of tsunamis has the potential to completely destroy infrastructure, wreak havoc on coastal populations, and result in a high death toll. Because of their unparalleled devastation, several tsunamis have left enduring impressions on history over the ages. Here are the top 10 deadliest tsunamis ever recorded in human history.The Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami of March 11, 2011, hit Japan with a magnitude of 9.0. This tsunami caused catastrophic damage to Japan's northeastern coast and led to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. The tsunami caused extensive economic damage and nuclear fallout.On December 26, 2004, one of the deadliest tsunamis in recorded history struck the Indian Ocean. Triggered by a massive undersea earthquake with a magnitude of 9.1-9.3, it affected countries such as Indonesia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, India, and several others. The tsunami resulted in entire communities being washed away.On December 26, 2003, a tsunami struck the coast of Iran following a magnitude 6.6 earthquake near Bam. The tsunami, combined with the earthquake's impact, led to the destruction of Bam and surrounding areas.The Valdivia earthquake, also known as the Great Chilean Earthquake, occurred on May 22, 1960, with a magnitude of 9.5, the strongest ever recorded. The tsunami affected Chile and spread across the Pacific Ocean, causing deaths in places as far away as Hawaii and Japan.On November 4, 1952, an earthquake with a magnitude of 9.0 struck the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia. The resulting tsunami affected the Pacific Ocean, reaching as far as Hawaii and causing significant damage in the region.On December 28, 1908, an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 struck the Strait of Messina between Sicily and mainland Italy. The resulting tsunami caused massive destruction in Messina and Reggio Calabria, killing an estimated 123,000 people. This event remains one of the deadliest tsunamis in European history.A magnitude 8.5 earthquake struck off the coast of Japan’s Sanriku region on June 15, 1896, triggering a massive tsunami. The waves hit the Japanese coast with enormous force, causing widespread destruction and killing many people. This event is often remembered for its sheer scale and impact on the local population.On August 13, 1868, a powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 8.5 struck off the coast of Peru. The resulting tsunami devastated coastal towns in Peru and Chile, particularly Arica (now in Chile). The waves were reported to have reached as far away as Hawaii.Following the earthquake of March 5, 1783, in Southern Italy, a tsunami struck the coast of Calabria. The earthquake, with a magnitude of around 7.9, triggered a tsunami that resulted in significant destruction and loss of life, with estimates of up to 50,000 deaths in the affected regions.Following the Lisbon earthquake on November 1, 1755, a devastating tsunami hit Portugal and its colonies. With an estimated magnitude of 8.5-9.0, the tsunami ravaged Lisbon and other Portuguese coastal cities, resulting in approximately 10,000-100,000 deaths","Tsunamis are among the most powerful natural disasters in recorded human history.

The couple's joint appearance, their first since the explosive Oprah Winfrey interview, has been branded a ""car crash"" amid allegations of behind-the-scenes tension and anger, as reported by The Mirror.During a recent appearance on GB News, Royal author Angela Levin shared her take on Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's latest interview, claiming that the Duchess of Sussex was ""screaming"" and ""very annoyed"" after the cameras stopped rolling, the Mirror reported.During the CBS Sunday Morning interview, the couple intended to discuss online harm and their philanthropic endeavors. However, the conversation took an unexpected turn when Meghan was questioned about her previously disclosed suicidal thoughts, which she reportedly did not expect. Royal author Angela Levin claims that Markle was visibly upset by the line of questioning, revealing a tense atmosphere that persisted off-camera.""After the interview was over, she was apparently screaming at the producers, very, very annoyed at what they had asked her,"" Levin said on Dan Wootton's show. ""You mustn't do that with Meghan because she's in control. But you could see she couldn't contain her anger, her fury,” she added.Observers and body language experts noted a palpable sense of discomfort between the couple during the interview. Harry appeared either bored or distracted, and Meghan’s icy stares seemed to convey dissatisfaction whenever he spoke. Broadcaster Dan Wootton remarked, “It certainly wasn’t a good 43rd birthday for the Duchess of Sussex, was it?”Levin further emphasized the strain in their dynamic, saying, ""Just the same as in and out of the interview, she couldn't stand Harry speaking. She would look at him with such harsh eyes and such a terrible expression on her face because she didn't want him to talk, I imagine. He is really lost at the moment... I think that he's in a very, very bad way.""The interview, which was meant to mark a fresh start in their public engagement, has instead raised questions about the couple’s relationship dynamics and their handling of media scrutiny. Branding it a “car crash,” Wootton commented on the failed attempt at damage control, noting the couple's awkward chemistry despite their united front.","Royal author Angela Levin claims that Meghan Markle was ""screaming"" and ""very annoyed"" after the CBS Sunday Morning interview.

This 90-minute showdown, expected to be held in Philadelphia, marks a pivotal moment in an unpredictable presidential campaign that has already seen significant twists and turns.The debate will be moderated by ABC anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis. Although the exact format and ground rules are still being finalized, it is likely that the event will proceed without a live audience, according to sources familiar with the plans.Notably, Trump had proposed three debates with major networks - September 4 with Fox News, September 10 with NBC, and September 25 with ABC. However, Harris has agreed to participate only in the September 10 debate with NBC. Harris has not yet provided reasons for declining the other proposed dates.This announcement follows Trump's initial agreement to debate President Joe Biden on the same date, an arrangement made months ago. However, after Biden's unexpected withdrawal from the race, Trump questioned the validity of that commitment with Harris, leading to uncertainty over whether the debate would take place.Recent events, including Biden's exit and an assassination attempt on Trump, have drawn renewed attention to the presidential race, which had initially been shaping up as a repeat of the 2020 election. The upcoming ABC debate is expected to serve as a critical moment in the campaign's final stretch leading up to the election.Trump has also indicated his willingness to engage in additional debates with Harris, proposing events hosted by NBC News and Fox News. However, the Harris campaign has not yet agreed to these additional debates. NBC News is reportedly in discussions with both campaigns about a potential debate on September 25, but Harris has not committed to participating.

Protests erupted outside both the White House and the UK Parliament this week, as demonstrators gathered to condemn the reported violence against minority Hindus and other groups in Bangladesh.

Broader context and historical parallels

Former President Donald Trump’s campaign accused Iran of orchestrating a hack and leak operation on Saturday, following the release of a 270-page dossier detailing the vulnerabilities of Ohio Senator JD Vance. The document, along with another concerning Florida Senator Marco Rubio, was sent to Politico from an AOL.com email address, the American digital newspaper said.The campaign has confirmed that some of its internal communications were hacked, marking a significant security breach ahead of the 2024 presidential election.Hours after Politico disclosed receiving the materials, the Trump campaign responded by alleging a cyber attack and pointing fingers at Iran. “The Iranians know that President Trump will stop their reign of terror just like he did in his first four years in the White House. Any media or news outlet reprinting documents or internal communications are doing the bidding of America’s enemies and doing exactly what they want,” Trump spokesman Steven Cheung told NBC News.Politico reported that the AOL email, using the alias “Robert,” began sending internal Trump campaign communications on July 22.Among the leaked documents was a 271-page report titled “POTENTIAL VULNERABILITIES,” detailing perceived weaknesses of JD Vance.The anonymous source claimed to possess a variety of documents from Trump’s legal and campaign discussions. When questioned about the source of the documents, “Robert” advised Politico not to inquire further, citing legal and personal risks.The scope of the breach remains unclear, but it is a significant security lapse for Trump’s campaign.This incident adds to the list of cybersecurity challenges faced by Trump.It brings to mind the 2016 hacking of top Democratic Party officials ahead of the presidential election, which led to the release of damaging emails and was later attributed to Russian interference. That breach and the subsequent investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, while not resulting in criminal charges against Trump, revealed a campaign willing to exploit such materials.In 2020, Trump's X account was compromised after a hacker guessed his password, ‘maga2020!’. More recently, the Department of Justice charged a Pakistani man, Asif Merchant, with ties to Iran, in connection with an alleged assassination plot targeting Trump.Iranian officials have yet to comment on the allegations, and the US intelligence community has not publicly confirmed the identity of the hackers responsible for the breach.The Biden administration has not yet commented on the alleged hack.As the 2024 election approaches, this hacking incident adds to the growing concerns over cybersecurity and foreign interference in the US democratic process.","The Trump campaign has accused Iran of orchestrating a hack and leak operation.

Trump said he was not sure whether Kamala Harris was Indian or Black because before 'turning' Black, Kamala Harris emphasized on his Indian roots.The New York Times has detailed the inside stories of the ""worst three weeks of Donald Trump's 2024 campaign"" -- how it unraveled, how Donald saw it etc.There was a dinner at Bridgehampton, home of Howard Lutnick, the Cantor Fitzgerald chief executive attended by 130 people including Bill Ackman. The NYT report citing insiders said Donald Trump himself brought up his remark of Kamala Harris Black or Indian and said: 'I think I was right"".Then he was asked about his plan to take the narrative back from Democrats. ""I am who I am,"" Trump said.People around Donald Trump told the NYT that Trump grew comfortable campaigning against Biden. And the change from Biden to a woman 20 years younger than him has been disorienting for Trump.The report said Trump has been in a foul mood the fast few weeks. He has ranted about Ms. Harris. He has called her “nasty,” on “Fox & Friends,” and a “bitch,” repeatedly, in private, according to two people who heard the remark on different occasions, NYT reported. Trump campaign spokesperson denied and said Trump never used that language.Trump also shot off angry text messages to one of his wealthiest donors, Miriam Adelson, the widow of casino magnet Sheldon Adelson. ""Mr. Trump dismissed out of hand donors’ suggestions that he replace Mr. Vance on the ticket. But Mr. Trump privately asked his advisers whether they had known about Mr. Vance’s comments about childless women before Mr. Trump chose him,"" the report said.He also said the 'weird' slogan by the Democrats against Republicans were not about him. ""They're saying that about JD"".","Donald Trump is adamant on his comment doubting Kamala Harris' ethnicity between Black and Indian.

I mean, the guy was an environmental lawyer and he cleaned up the East River. He’s a legitimate guy.”Rogan has a huge audience, with more than 14.5 million listeners just on Spotify, which this year gave him a deal worth a reported $250m.At Rogan's 'endorsement' for Kennedy Jr, Trump was not happy and posted: ""It will be interesting to see how loudly Joe Rogan gets BOOED the next time he enters the UFC Ring??? MAGA2024"" Rogan is a UFC commentator and often enters the ring for post-fight interviews.Joe Rogan then said he was not actually endorsing RFK jr . What he meant was that he liked him as a person.""For the record, this isn’t an endorsement. This is me saying that I like RFKjr as a person, and I really appreciate the way he discusses things with civility and intelligence. I think we could use more of that in this world. I also think Trump raising his fist and saying “fight!” after getting shot is one of the most American fucking things of all time. I’m not the guy to get political information from. If you want that from a comic, go to@ComicDaveSmith. He actually knows what he’s talking about,"" Joe Rogan said.","Rogan said Kennedy was the only candidate that made sense to him.

Dogs days of election: NYT says Trump called Kamala a b****,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/dogs-days-of-election-nyt-says-trump-called-kamala-a-bitch/articleshow/112431343.cms,"WASHINGTON : A report that Republican candidate Donald Trump called Kamala Harris a ""bitch"" is scorching the political turf in a US campaign that is turning more toxic and uglier by the day.Although Trump has called Kamala Harris ""dumb"" ""incompetent"" and ""low IQ"" in public, including during a campaign speech in Montana on Friday, characterising her as a ""bitch,"" which the New York Times reported he did in a private meeting, takes things to a new low level.The paper cited two people it did not name as having heard the remark on different occasions, while quoting Trump campaign communications director Steven Cheung as countering, “That is not language President Trump has used to describe Kamala, and it’s not how the campaign would characterize her.""Trump has publicly disparaged several women, including political rivals and female reporters, calling them ""nasty"" and ""stupid"" when challenged with tough questions. In an Access Hollywood tape, he also talked of the ease with which he could grab women by their genitals because he was famous.While some US leaders have been known to use salty language in private ( Most notoriously, Richard Nixon called Indira Gandhi a bitch and a witch), Trump constant denigration of Harris has taken on a ferocious turn as he falls behind on the polls. At his Montana rally, he repeated his call that ""she should get the hell out of here,"" echoes of his exhortation to foreign-born US female lawmakers that they should go back to where they came from.Kamala Harris was born in Oakland, California to immigrant parents when they were students in Berkeley, and some Trump surrogates have argued that she is not eligible to run for the White House because she is an ""anchor baby"" -- born to parents when they were not US citizens. Constitutional experts say their status does not matter as long as she was born in the US.New polls indicate Trump's racist and sexist attacks are starting to backfire outside his hardcore MAGA base which laps up his racism and sexism and believes he is god's gift to America. In fact, a NYT/Siena College poll released Friday put Harris ahead of Trump 65-56 when asked who is more intelligent.But at his Montana rally, Trump continued to disparage her to the extent of mocking her name, wondering how she got an anglophone last name like Harris, and acknowledging he willfully mispronounces her first name.""America cannot survive for four more years of this bumbling communist lunatic,"" he told his MAGA supporters.","Trump has publicly disparaged several women, including political rivals and female reporters.

'I couldn't care less': Did Trump explain why he calls Harris 'Kamabla'?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/i-couldnt-care-less-did-trump-explain-why-he-calls-harris-kamabla/articleshow/112431330.cms,"Former president Donald Trump has been referring to Kamala Harris as 'Kamabla' -- a term which has no explained meaning. There are speculations that it is a willful distortion of Kamala's name to incorporate Black in it, or that Trump has been suggesting that 'Kamala Harris is blah'. But there has been no explanation given until Trump addressed his habit of 'bad name calling'.At the rally, Trump said he has frequently mispronounced Kamala Harris' name but he couldn't care less how it should be pronounced.Trump said the media is so dishonest that whichever way he pronounces the name they call it wrong and they say it has been done on purpose. He then admitted that he has in the past done a lot of bad name-calling where he purposefully mispronounced a person's name. ""They say, ""Sir, you made a mistake'. I said, 'No, I didn't,"" Trump said.As Trump was addressing the rally -- the first after Kamala Harris officially became the Democrat's presidential candidate and then chose Tim Walz as her running partner -- he asked the audience to choose between 'crooked Joe' and 'sleepy Joe' -- the nicknames he has for Joe Biden.""Both are correct but 'crooked Joe' always wins. If he didn't do the debate, he'd be still running. They would be saying how great he is, he is a brilliant man, wonderful guy, at the top of his game. But he was not at the top of his game 25 years back. But she is worse than him. Democrats didn't have the courage to do what's politically incorrect...If you can't address a press conference, you can't become the president,"" Trump said.Then Trump said everybody started copying his style of coming to the media outside the helicopter. He said he used to like it because if he didn't like a question, he used to say he could not hear because of the helicopter. ""They do mini versions.
