NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court will hear a plea filed by Ladakh-based climate activist Sonam Wangchuk ’s wife against his detention on October 6, ANI reported.The habeas corpus plea, filed by social entrepreneur Geetanjali Angmo, will be taken up by a bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and NV Anjaria.Wangchuk, a former educationist, was detained by police on September 26, two days after violent protests erupted in Ladakh’s capital Leh over demands for statehood and inclusion under the 6th Schedule of the Constitution of India. He was transferred to a jail in faraway Jodhpur, Rajasthan, and booked under the stringent National Security Act (NSA).Authorities allege that Wangchuk “incited” the violence. At the time, he had been leading a hunger strike—which he later called off—advocating for statehood for Ladakh, a Union territory created in August 2019, and its inclusion in the 6th Schedule. On that day, a faction of mostly young protesters broke away from the peaceful agitation and engaged in clashes with security forces.Four protesters were killed in clashes with the police and CRPF, while several others—including security personnel—sustained injuries.","The Supreme Court will hear a plea filed by Ladakh-based climate activist Sonam Wangchuk ’s wife against his detention on October 6.

SP MP: Police trapping innocents in false cases, seizing their properties

BAREILLY: A Samajwadi Party (SP) delegation led by leader of opposition in UP assembly Mata Prasad Pandey was on Saturday stopped at multiple locations across the state while on its way to Bareilly to meet families affected by the communal clashes that broke out following the recent 'I love Muhammad' row in the town.Earlier in the day, Bareilly Development Authority demolished a marriage hall linked to Dr Nafees Ahmed, an aide of Ittehad-e-Millat Council chief Tauqeer Raza, who has been arrested for alleged involvement in the violence that broke out following Friday prayers on Sept 26. A house where Raza was reportedly sheltered during the unrest was also sealed.Bareilly SSP Anurag Arya said 83 people had been arrested so far in connection with the incident.The SP delegation — which included Barq, Kairana MP Iqra Hasan and Muzaffarnagar MP Harendra Singh — was part of a fact-finding team that had planned to meet victims’ families and speak with local officials. Barq questioned the rationale for stopping them. “When the police and administration claim everything is normal, why are we being stopped? We have been getting complaints that police are trapping innocents in false cases and seizing their properties.We want it to be stopped.”Hasan alleged that the MPs were treated like criminals instead of elected representatives. “We were pushed and shoved. This undeclared emergency has led to the collapse of law and order in the state. Today or tomorrow, we will reach Bareilly, and UP govt’s wrongdoing will be exposed,” she said. “Today, law is being run by issuing diktats.”In a video posted by SP on X, Pandey said an SHO told him to remain at home, and that the district magistrate warned his visit could disturb peace. “We do not disturb the atmosphere; the administration is not allowing us to go there to cover up its own shortcomings,” he said.SSP Anurag Arya said, “We are currently reviewing CCTV footage to identify others involved in the incident. Ten FIRs have been registered, and a SIT will conduct the probe.” Meanwhile, the demolition action by Bareilly Development Authority drew criticism from legal experts. Senior Allahabad high court lawyer SFA Naqvi told TOI that the bulldozer action violated a Supreme Court ruling from November 2024, which held that demolishing the homes of accused persons without due process infringes upon the fundamental right to shelter under Article 21 of the Constitution.Bareilly Development Authority officials said the demolition of the Raza Marriage Hall and the sealing of four shops linked to Dr Nafees Ahmed were carried out due to “building norm violations.” Joint secretary Deepak Kumar said that“legal action is also being taken against the Raza marriage hall.”","A Samajwadi Party (SP) delegation led by leader of opposition in UP assembly Mata Prasad Pandey was stopped at multiple locations across the state.

Ladakh Statehood Violence: BJP Blames Congress While Sonam Wangchuk Says Gen-Z Led The Protests

SRINAGAR: The Ladakh government said on Saturday that the Centre “stands committed to holding a dialogue and addressing the aspirations of the people of Ladakh, especially of the younger generation, and would be keen to start the dialogue process soon”.Talks between a high-powered Union home ministry committee and Ladakhi groups, including Leh Apex Body (LAB) and Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA), were scheduled for October 6. But after the Sept 24 incident in which security forces allegedly fired at protesters seeking Sixth Schedule status and statehood for Ladakh, killing four and injuring dozens, both groups called off the talks and demanded an inquiry by a retired Supreme Court judge.“The people of Ladakh are known in the country for their peace-loving nature, their fierce patriotism, and for their overall contribution to nation-building and in securing its frontiers,” Pawan Kotwal, chief secretary, UT of Ladakh, who is also adviser to the Ladakh L-G, said at a press conference in Leh. He added that the government has always expressed its desire for an open and constructive dialogue and has never avoided any meetings.Kotwal said that the land, resources, jobs, and livelihood of Ladakhis would remain protected.“Govt would continue to work with the people of Ladakh to protect the ecosystem as well as its cultural identity. As regards to the increase in Lok Sabha seats, the same was discussed during the high-powered committee (HPC) and it was observed that it would be taken up at the time of delimitation,” Kotwal added.“Our policies are not just guided by population. Even with a small population, Ladakh would remain govt’s priority,” he said.“Regarding the issue of solar park industrialisation, and environment degradation, it is reiterated that we are moving on a firm path of developing a carbon-neutral Ladakh,” Kotwal added.“Nothing will happen without consultation and the consent of the local community. There has been no mining activity in Ladakh at all. There is no commercial exploitation of resources at all. Politically motivated organisations should not mislead the people,” Kotwal said.“There is no absolutely no sign of demographic change or cultural homogenisation. By using the words ‘demographic flooding’ and ‘cultural genocides’, the organisations are misleading the people and creating a smoke screen,” he added.He said that regarding land all powers continue to rest with the respective Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDCs), and the government has already commenced making land laws more people-friendly. “No power of LAHDCs has been taken away.”","Talks between a high-powered Union home ministry committee and Ladakhi groups were scheduled for October 6.

Govt using police to silence victims, oppn: Bhim Army chief

MEERUT/BAREILLY: Internet services, including mobile data, broadband and SMS services, were suspended across Bareilly on Thursday afternoon amid fears of unrest on Friday when people will gather to offer juma namaz. According to a govt notification, internet services will remain suspended in Bareilly from 3 pm on Oct 2 to 3 pm on Oct 4.Security has been tightened across four districts in Bareilly division, with heavy deployment of forces on streets and drones in air. Some sensitive areas in the city looked like fortresses, and many roads and lanes in localities remained deserted.City magistrate Alankar Agnihotri said, “Internet will remain suspended for 48 hours, considering the sensitivity of the situation.” The precaution follows last week’s clashes during a procession after Friday prayers over ‘I Love Muhammad’ row. Police resorted to lathi charge to control the situation. So far, over 80 people, including local cleric and Ittehad-e-Millat Council president Tauqeer Raza Khan, his close associates Dr Nafees Khan and Nadeem Khan, have been arrested.On Thursday, Ala Hazrat Association urged the people to offer Friday namaz peacefully and return home promptly.From the Sunni Markaz at Dargah Ala Hazrat, Jamaat Raza-e-Mustafa national vice-president Salman Hasan Khan appealed to imams and the public to maintain peace, avoid rumours and cooperate with authorities. He also requested special prayers during Friday sermons for harmony.In Muslim-majority areas fears of impending action by the administration prevailed. Teams from Bareilly Development Authority are surveying properties to identify violations. Structures without approved maps or violating building regulations will face notices, sealing and demolition.The authority’s vice-chairman Manikandan A said, “Action is being taken at every level against those accused of rioting and their supporters. Every illegal brick will be accounted for. This drive will serve as a lesson to accused and a warning to others who break the law”.In Saharanpur, Chandrashekhar Azad was put under house arrest as he was planning to meet families of those affected in last week’s violence. Azad accused govt of “using police to silence victims and opposition voices” and demanded an impartial probe into the violence.“Following a letter from Bareilly district magistrate, police force from Fatehpur and Dehat police stations were deployed outside Azad’s house in Chhutmalpur area of Saharanpur. His presence in Bareilly might lead to law-and-order issues in that city,” Saharanpur SSP Ashish Tiwari told TOI.On Wednesday, two Congress leaders — Saharanpur MP Imran Masood and former MP from Amroha Kunwar Danish Ali —were put under house arrest to stop them from visiting Bareilly.","Internet services, including mobile data, broadband and SMS services, were suspended across Bareilly on Thursday afternoon.

He is scheduled to be shifted to the ward tomorrow.According to the doctors at the hospital, Kharge had a viral fever preceding his admission last week, and his heart rate was low when admitted.“While his angiogram came normal and there were no blockages in his blood vessels, there were anomalies in his heart’s electrical activity and thus advised a pacemaker,” said doctors to TOI.Taking to social media to dispel any misinformation, Kharge’s son and Karnataka minister Priyank Kharge said: “Sri Kharge was advised a pacemaker to be implanted and is admitted to the hospital for the planned procedure.

'Pakistan Could Not Kill Him But...': Father On Kargil War Veteran Killed In Ladakh Clashes

Poll Do you think Ladakh should have more local governance powers? Yes, more autonomy is needed No, current administration is sufficient

LEH: At Martyrs’ Park, about 1km from the Ladakh Hill Development Council (LAHDC-Leh) office, the gate stood open during curfew relaxation. Inside, chairs were stacked and a tent was dismantled. Labourers were quietly loading chairs, tent covers and iron rods into a vehicle, their faces grim.It was here that environmental activist Sonam Wangchuk began a 35-day hunger strike Sept 10, demanding Sixth Schedule protections and statehood for Ladakh. “We provide tents on rent. They called us to take it back,” a worker said. Startled at the sight of a reporter, he said, “Please go away, cops will come and we will be in trouble.”A woman entered with her child. “I was on hunger strike on Sept 24 when the situation worsened outside,” she said. “Out of fear, some of us ran in different directions. My husband later picked me up. I came back to collect my belongings.”On Sept 24, security forces opened fire on protesters demanding Sixth Schedule status, killing four and injuring dozens. Wangchuk called off his hunger strike hours later. Authorities said the police fired in self-defence after protesters tried to set ablaze a vehicle carrying security personnel.Police also claimed that without CRPF deployment, “the whole of Leh would have burnt”.Outside the park, another woman voiced her anger. “Why were people fired upon? Four people are dead. Will they give us Sixth Schedule?”About 1km away BJP’s Ladakh office, which was set on fire, was under heavy guard with spools of concertina wire around it. Cops prohibit photography of the building.At the LAHDC-Leh office, the main gate was open but there was no one there. “Since Sept 24, chief executive officer Tashi Gyalson and others haven’t come to office. In fact, no one comes,” a peon said.Mustafa Ladakhi, 36, a PhD from JNU, is among a growing number of Ladakhis at the country’s top universities concerned about home. At a hotel near Leh airport, he said the region is still in shock.“On Sept 24, my mother was on a hunger strike led by Wangchuk. There was chaos when she called me. I found her in the middle of the road. I will never forget the pain that day brought to Ladakhis,” he said. “No official has stepped down. There is no empathy. There is no apology. Instead, we are accused in the national media of destabilising the central govt... How can we be a threat when we have paid with our lives for the nation?”He argued that UT status without statehood had buried local governance under bureaucracy. “Instead of empowering local govt, we have the lieutenant governor’s office and its bureaucracy, commissioner secretaries, the DC’s office, and the police bureaucracy. They have nothing to do in Ladakh. All we see is pomp and a show of bureaucracy... Allow us to govern ourselves,” he said.“When we were part of J&K, AFSPA was never extended to Ladakh because govt knew we were Indian nationalists. Why this labelling now?” he asked.Ladakhi’s friend, a hotel owner, said, “I don’t want to talk about tourism. This is a colossal tragedy. Four deaths in a place like Ladakh are like 400 in Delhi. Sept 24 will remain etched in our memory.”In Upper Tukchal area of Leh, Rigzin Wangmo Lachic, president of All Ladakh Hotel and Guest House Association, echoed similar sentiments and demanded a judicial inquiry. “The events have shattered us and left a wound on our collective soul,” she said.At a hotel serving Kashmiri wazwan on Oct 1, during curfew relaxation, the receptionist from Doda said he no longer felt safe. “I’ve been here 10 years and never faced hostility. But after the lieutenant governor described workers from Doda and Nepal as ‘external forces’ responsible for the crisis, we are not stepping out much.”As curfew returned, shops shut ahead of the 6 pm deadline. “We comply with every direction. But govt must fulfil our four demands, including Sixth Schedule and statehood,” Gelek Punchok, 42, a member of Leh Apex Body, said. Punchok was outside the district jail, with many others, to receive around 26 prisoners released Thursday after they were given bail. Many of the released detainees said they had nothing to do with the Sept 24 violence but stated that they were with the “peaceful” struggle for Sixth Schedule status and statehood.","Environmental activist Sonam Wangchuk began a 35-day hunger strike Sept 10, demanding Sixth Schedule protections and statehood for Ladakh.

Kyren Lacy’s attorney Matthew Ory challenges crash claims

Kyren Lacy’s death in Houston and reactions from family and teammates

“They slander your name, your character, and painted you as the bad guy. But we your family, teammates, and friends know the real you LLK2.”

“Young parents, start talking to your kids … Mental health is real, and for the most part it’s invisible. Don’t ignore the signs, even if they may seem small,”

Kyren Lacy, 24-year-old former LSU wide receiver, is back in the headlines after his attorney shared new evidence about his case. On October 3, 2025, attorney Matthew Ory spoke to HTV10 and said video footage shows that Lacy was far behind the cars involved in a fatal crash in Lafourche Parish, Louisiana, on December 17, 2024. That accident killed Herman Hall, 78, and injured two people. Authorities had accused Lacy of causing the crash. Ory now says those claims were wrong.Matthew Ory showed a video from a nearby gas station that he says changes the story. The clip shows Lacy’s car was about 72.6 yards behind the vehicles that collided with Hall’s car. Ory admitted that Lacy did pass four cars earlier, but said he was already back in his lane at the time of the crash.Ory told HTV10, “He was back in his lane … 72.6 yards behind the vehicles at the time of impact. That is not how this story was ever painted, never.”Louisiana State Police have a different view. They still say Lacy’s passing maneuvers forced another driver to swerve, leading to the deadly accident. A police statement said, “His swerving, passing cars, and reckless operation caused the series of crash events.”After the crash, Kyren Lacy was charged with negligent homicide, felony hit-and-run, and reckless operation of a vehicle.He turned himself in on January 12, 2025, and was released after posting $151,000 bail.Months later, in April 2025, Lacy’s life ended in Houston, Texas. The Harris County Sheriff’s Office said he refused to stop for police, leading to a chase that lasted several miles. After his car crashed, deputies found that Lacy had shot himself.

Elaine Chen and Larry Fitzpatrick allege retaliation by the New York Jets

New York Jets deny allegations and prepare countersuit against Elaine Chen and Larry Fitzpatrick

Elaine Chen, who worked as vice president of finance for the New York Jets, says she was removed from her job after sexual harassment complaints were raised against team president Hymie Elhai. The lawsuit, filed in New York in October 2025, claims Chen and her husband, Larry Fitzpatrick, the Jets’ former vice president of ticket sales, were pushed out of the franchise in July 2025. Chen argues she was punished for supporting the allegations against Elhai, while the Jets strongly deny her claims.In her filing, Elaine Chen says the issue began in July 2025, when an anonymous email was sent to several Jets employees. That email accused Hymie Elhai of sending inappropriate text messages and making unprofessional remarks to women in the workplace.Elaine Chen says her husband, Larry Fitzpatrick, was questioned by team officials after receiving the email and was fired on July 25. She says she was dismissed just five days later, on July 30, despite denying any role in writing or sharing the email.Chen claims she had no direct proof but had heard from others that Elhai harassed female staff members.In the lawsuit, she says she was told she lost her job because the team could no longer trust her.She also argues that at least two other employees who saw the same anonymous email were not punished. According to Chen, the Jets were “targeting anyone” who believed the allegations should be properly investigated.The Jets have called the lawsuit “categorically false.” In a statement published on October 3, 2025, the franchise said it carried out a third-party investigation and found that the claims against Hymie Elhai had no merit.The team says the anonymous email was actually part of a “deliberate conspiracy” involving Elaine Chen, Larry Fitzpatrick, and other former employees.Also Read: Arthur Jones cause of death: How did the Ravens’ Super Bowl champion die at 39 The Jets also accuse Fitzpatrick of deleting more than 4,000 text messages to hide his role in the matter. They claim those texts showed both Fitzpatrick and Chen worked together to create the email that tried to damage Elhai’s reputation.According to the franchise, Chen’s lawsuit left out important evidence and contradicted her earlier interviews during the internal review.A New York Jets spokesperson told The Daily Mail that Chen was fired “for legitimate and lawful business reasons” and accused her of joining a plan to defame Elhai.The team says it will now countersue Elaine Chen, Fitzpatrick, and others for defamation and libel. Hymie Elhai, who joined the Jets in 2000 and became president in 2019, has not commented directly on the case.","Elaine Chen and Larry Fitzpatrick allege retaliation by the New York Jets.

Super Bowl Showdown? Trump Adviser Targets Bad Bunny as ICE Presence Sparks Halftime Uproar

“Who is Bad Bunny?”

Danica Patrick and Bad Bunny share their views

“What I care about is that I can sing along to the music,” Patrick said.

“His music is almost nothing in English. I don’t think it will be as uniting.”

Casey DeSantis, the wife of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, surprised many people on October 2, 2025, when she asked on X, “Not trying to start anything here, but honestly… who exactly is Bad Bunny ?” The question came just hours after the NFL confirmed that Puerto Rican music star Bad Bunny, whose real name is Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, will headline the Super Bowl LX halftime show in Las Vegas in February 2026. Her post quickly added to the growing debate among conservatives who were already upset about the choice.Ron DeSantis, who has more than 4.3 million Spanish-speaking voters in Florida, did not directly attack Bad Bunny. Instead, on the same day, October 2, he wrote on X that he still hopes one day Metallica will get the chance to perform during the Super Bowl halftime. “I’m still hoping that, someday, the NFL will have Metallica headline the halftime show,” he posted.Casey DeSantis, however, kept her comment simple. She did not suggest another band. Instead, her short question——quickly spread online and drew thousands of replies. Many people joked about her not knowing the world-famous star, while others supported her for speaking out.This came after many conservatives complained about Bad Bunny’s music being mostly in Spanish and about his past criticism of President Donald Trump.The pushback began right after Jay-Z’s Roc Nation, which partners with the NFL on halftime shows, selected Bad Bunny for the 2026 performance.Former NASCAR driver Danica Patrick also weighed in during an interview on Steve Bannon’s “War Room” podcast. She explained that the Super Bowl, watched by more than 127 million people across the U.S. every year, is supposed to unite viewers of all ages.She added that people who dislike the choice may even watch counter-shows during halftime.Also Read: Arthur Jones Cause Of Death: How Did The Ravens’ Super Bowl Champion Die At 39 Bad Bunny responded to the NFL’s announcement by calling the moment a victory for his community. “What I’m feeling goes beyond myself.This is for my people, my culture, and our history,” he said after the news was made official. In his recent single NUEVAYoL, released in summer 2025, he even included a voice that sounded like the U.S. President apologizing to immigrants in America.","Casey DeSantis, wife of Florida governor, asked on X, “Who exactly is Bad Bunny?” The question came just hours after the NFL confirmed that Puerto Rican music star Bad Bunny will headline the Super Bowl LX halftime show in Las Vegas in February 2026.

US government shuts down: Elon Musk on the biggest issue that 'stopped' funding of American government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-government-shuts-down-elon-musk-on-the-biggest-issue-that-stopped-funding-of-american-government/articleshow/124250140.cms,"Elon Musk on the US government shutdown

Poll Do you believe the government shutdown will last longer than two weeks? Yes No

Previous US government shutdowns

What programs and payments will stop during US government shutdown





The US government has officially shut down for the first time in six years after a deadlocked Congress failed to pass a funding measure. The full shutdown began at midnight Wednesday, September 30, after Democratic and Republican leaders failed to agree on even a short-term deal to keep the government fully funded past the current fiscal year. So far, it is unclear how long the shutdown will last, or how widespread its impact will be.A key sticking point behind the stalemate is said to be Democrats’ insistence on including the extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits in any stopgap funding bill. Republicans have claimed that Democrats are pushing to provide government benefits to undocumented immigrants. Republicans claim that Democrats want to give health care to ""illegal immigrants."" Democrats say that they are only trying to restore health care coverage options that were available to immigrants having “lawful presence” in the United States before those options were eliminated by President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful” tax bill this year.While so far Elon Musk has not directly commented on the US government shutdown, he has shared/reposted several tweets that support Republican's claim that Democrats want to give health care benefits to ""illegal immigrants”. He quoted VP JD Vance's post on Chuck Schumer rewarding illegal immigrants, and wrote, ""Once Chuck realized that importing voters was a surefire way for Dems to win elections and create a permanent one-party state in America (just like happened in California and New York), he became very much in favor of bribing illegals to come to America!""In his post, JD Vance wrote, ""Chuck Schumer once recognized that it was disastrous to give illegal aliens rewards for breaking the law.Now he wants to shut down the government unless we…reward illegal aliens for breaking the law. x.com/westernlensman…""Elon Musk also shared a Twitter post of White House deputy chief of Staff for Policy and Homeland Security Advisor Stephen Miller that says, ""First shutdown in world history to demand free healthcare for illegal aliens.""""In 2019, every Democrat presidential candidate rose their hand in support for healthcare for illegal aliens. Today, Democrats are willing to shut down the government over free healthcare for illegals. Democrats have always put illegals before Americans,"" reads another Tweet reposted by Elon Musk.The American federal government has either shut down or experienced funding gaps 14 times since 1980. The longest shutdown on record occurred in late 2018 and early 2019, lasting 35 days. That partial shutdown was a result of a stalemate over President Donald Trump’s demand for funding for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.While every government shutdown is unique, they all operate under the same basic principles: non-essential services cease, and many federal employees are furloughed without pay. However, agencies deemed critical for the ""protection of lives and property"" remain operational. These ""essential"" employees, who include air traffic controllers, law enforcement agents, and active-duty military personnel, are required to work but do not receive their paychecks until funding is restored.However, OMB this time is said to be not posting agencies’ shutdown contingency plans on its website. Instead, the plans are hosted only on each agency’s site. This is reported to have made it harder to assess how the Trump administration will handle the shutdown and which activities it will deem essential.","The US government has officially shut down for the first time in six years after a deadlocked Congress failed to pass a funding measure.

On Cam: IDF Commandos Storm Gaza Flotilla; Boats With Greta, Mandela Kin 'Captured'





Eyewitnesses on a flotilla carrying aid to Gaza described environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg being dragged, beaten, and paraded by Israeli forces after her detention. The accounts depict a scene of intimidation and mistreatment that shocked those on board.An email from the Swedish foreign ministry to people close to Thunberg, citing an official who visited her in prison, said she was held in a cell infested with bedbugs, given insufficient food and water, and forced to sit for long periods on hard surfaces.“The embassy has been able to meet with Greta,” reads the email. “She informed of dehydration. She has received insufficient amounts of both water and food. She also stated that she had developed rashes which she suspects were caused by bedbugs. She spoke of harsh treatment and said she had been sitting for long periods on hard surfaces.”Another detainee reportedly told an embassy, as quoted by The Guardian, that Thunberg was forced to hold flags while pictures were taken. “She wondered whether images of her had been distributed,” the Swedish official added. These allegations were corroborated by at least two other members of the flotilla who had been detained and later released.Eyewitnesses described the treatment in more vivid detail. Turkish activist Ersin Çelik, a participant in the Sumud flotilla, told Anadolu news agency: “They dragged little Greta by her hair before our eyes, beat her, and forced her to kiss the Israeli flag. They did everything imaginable to her, as a warning to others.”Lorenzo D’Agostino, a journalist and flotilla participant, said Thunberg was “wrapped in the Israeli flag and paraded like a trophy” – a scene described with disbelief and anger by those who witnessed it.Thunberg was among 437 activists, parliamentarians, and lawyers on the Global Sumud flotilla, a coalition of more than 40 vessels carrying humanitarian aid attempting to breach Israel’s 16-year maritime blockade of Gaza. Between Thursday and Friday, Israeli forces intercepted all the boats and arrested every crew member. Most are being held at Ketziot prison in the Negev desert, a facility primarily used for Palestinian security detainees.Lawyers representing the flotilla said that detainees were left for hours without food or water, with the exception of “a packet of crisps handed to Greta and shown to the cameras.” Instances of verbal and physical abuse were also reported.According to the NGO Adalah, detainees’ rights were “systematically violated,” including denial of water, sanitation, medication, and access to legal representatives.During a visit to Ashdod port on Thursday night, Israel’s far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, was filmed calling the activists “terrorists.” “These are the terrorists of the flotilla,” he said in Hebrew, pointing at dozens of people sitting on the ground. Some activists were heard shouting, “Free Palestine.” Ben-Gvir has previously called for activists to be jailed rather than deported, reported The Guardian.This marks the second time Thunberg has been arrested during a flotilla attempt; a previous attempt earlier this year ended with her arrest and deportation. French doctor Baptiste Andre, who was on one of the boats in June, told reporters that Israeli agents had mocked and deliberately deprived passengers of sleep, singling out Thunberg.","Swedish activist Greta Thunberg was arrested during a flotilla to Gaza.

Hamas Demands Israel Exit Clarity As Trump Issues New Threat Amid Hostage Release Deal





President Donald Trump ’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner and senior US envoy Steve Witkoff are travelling to Egypt to advance ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas, the White House said on Saturday.The move follows Hamas’ announcement that it is ready to release Israeli hostages under Trump’s proposed peace plan, two years after the conflict began.A White House official said the envoys will finalise the technical details of a hostage release and discuss a long-term ceasefire agreement, according to the Guardian.Egypt will host delegations from Israel and Hamas on Monday to discuss the proposed exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, the country’s foreign ministry confirmed.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also confirmed that Israel’s negotiating team would travel to Egypt to finalise the technical aspects of the proposed Gaza deal, saying he hoped to announce the release of all hostages soon.“I have instructed the negotiating team to go to Egypt to finalise the technical details. The intention is to limit the negotiations to a few days,” Netanyahu said in a televised statement.Israeli PM said that he hopes to bring all hostages home in the coming days, coinciding with the Jewish festival of Sukkot.Speaking on Saturday, he emphasised that Hamas would be disarmed either through diplomacy under Trump’s plan or militarily by Israel.The talks come a month after Israeli airstrikes in Qatar killed six Hamas negotiators, derailing previous ceasefire efforts. Despite Trump urging Israel to halt its bombing in response to Hamas’ declaration, attacks continued over the weekend.Palestinian authorities reported at least 17 deaths, mostly women and children in Gaza City, with dozens more injured. Israeli drones also targeted gatherings in central Gaza and al-Mawasi, previously designated as “safe zones.”Hamas condemned Israel’s continued military operations, accusing Netanyahu of lying about reducing attacks on civilians. Earlier on Saturday, Israeli army radio reported that operations would be limited to “defensive” strikes.Trump, in a post on Truth Social, welcomed Israel’s temporary pause in bombing but warned Hamas to act quickly or risk losing the deal.Trump has described the negotiations as close to completion. In an interview with Axios, he said that Israel had agreed to an initial withdrawal line, which had been shared with Hamas and that once Hamas accepts it, the ceasefire and the hostages-prisoner exchange would begin.He emphasised his intention to restore international support for Israel, which has faced criticism over the deaths of tens of thousands of Palestinians during the military campaign.Trump also praised Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan for helping pressure Hamas to agree to the hostage release. “Erdoğan helped a lot. He is a tough guy, but he is a friend of mine and he was great,” US President said.Israel has stated that its military actions are acts of self-defence, rejecting UN findings and academic assessments that it has committed genocide in Gaza.

Chicago On Fire: ICE Under Attack, Shells Fired; Protester Grabs Officer's Beard Amid Clashes

What triggered the uproar?

President Trump and I have your backs: Kristi Noem



Trump authorises National Guard deployment



Marimar Martinez shot by federal agent



'ICE, go home!' chant protesters







Federal authorities in Chicago faced a violent clash on Saturday as Border Patrol officers were attacked by individuals who rammed law enforcement vehicles.Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem has vowed to escalate operations, calling the assailants “violent anarchists” and promising reinforcements to restore order.According to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), officers were ambushed while on patrol. One of the attackers, Marimar Martinez, was driving a vehicle and armed with a semi-automatic weapon. DHS said she had a history of doxxing federal agents. The woman was shot in defensive fire by CBP officers, treated at Mount Sinai Hospital, and released. Shewas sent to FBI custody. Another driver, Anthony Ian Santos Ruiz, involved in ramming a federal vehicle, was also apprehended.""The scene became increasingly violent as more domestic terrorists gathered and began throwing smoke, gas, rocks, and bottles at DHS law enforcement,"" DHS said. Another individual was arrested for assaulting officers at the scene.Secretary Kristi Noem posted on X, ""Our brave men and women of law enforcement are being targeted and attacked by violent anarchists who seek to tear down America. I want each and every member of law enforcement to know this: President Trump and I have your backs.""In a second post, she added, ""Today in Chicago, members of our brave law enforcement were attacked—rammed and boxed in by ten vehicles, including an attacker with a semi-automatic weapon. I am deploying more special operations to control the scene. Reinforcements are on their way. If you see a law enforcement officer today, thank them.""US President Donald Trump responded by authorising 300 National Guard troops to protect federal officers and assets in Chicago. White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said, ""President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities."" The deployment follows weeks of Trump threatening action despite objections from local officials, including Illinois governor JB Pritzker.Pritzker called the deployment unnecessary and “a manufactured performance — not a serious effort to protect public safety.”The confrontation occurred after a federal agent shot and wounded Marimar Martinez on Chicago’s Southwest Side. DHS said the motorist attempted to run over officers after her vehicle boxed in a Border Patrol vehicle. No officers were seriously injured.Federal operations in Chicago mirror previous deployments in other cities, including Los Angeles and Washington, DC. Tennessee National Guard troops are also expected to assist police in Memphis.The events in Chicago drew hundreds of local residents, who protested against federal immigration enforcement. Demonstrators waved Mexican and American flags, blew whistles, and chanted, ""ICE, go home!"" Local police formed lines to separate protesters and federal officers.Federal authorities reported that several CBP officers were hospitalised with injuries. ICE vehicles were damaged, and operations required tactical withdrawal for safety.","Border Patrol officers in Chicago were attacked by individuals who rammed law enforcement vehicles.

What is the plan?







The Conservative Party plans to launch a new ""Removals Force"" designed to deport 150,000 people each year as part of a wider strategy to address illegal immigration in the UK.Modeled on the “successful approach” of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the new Removals Force, unveiled on Sunday, is set to receive £1.6 billion in funding and “sweeping new powers,” including the ability to use facial recognition technology without prior warning to identify illegal immigrants.The force is expected to work “closely” with the police, who would be required to carry out immigration checks on all individuals they stop or arrest.The Conservative Party will unveil plans on Sunday, led by Kemi Badenoch, emphasizing “Strong Borders” as a key theme of their annual conference.“We must tackle the scourge of illegal immigration into Britain and secure our borders,"" Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said, as cited by the Independent. “That is why the Conservatives are setting out a serious and comprehensive new plan to end this crisis.”Under the plan, the immigration tribunal would be abolished, with the Home Office handling all migration decisions and offering only limited appeal rights in cases where officials act beyond their statutory authority.The plan also proposes a major overhaul of the asylum system, limiting refugee status to individuals facing threats from foreign governments.The plan would also exclude individuals fleeing conflict or countries with “less tolerant” laws on religion or sexuality, with the party noting that “few people will qualify,"" as reported by the Independent.Immigration cases would no longer receive legal aid under the pln. The Conservatives accused solicitors of “defrauding” the UK by “coaching” applicants and argued that legal representation is unnecessary, claiming people “should simply tell the truth about their circumstances.”On Saturday, Kemi Badenoch stated that the Conservatives would withdraw the UK from the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) if they win the next election.The Conservative leadership is under persistent pressure on immigration from the party’s right, as polls suggest Reform UK could perform strongly in the next election despite holding only five MPs.The Conservative leadership is under persistent pressure on immigration from the party’s right, as polls suggest Reform UK could perform strongly in the next election despite holding only five MPs.","The Conservative Party plans to launch a new ""Removals Force"" designed to deport 150,000 people each year.

London police on Saturday arrested hundreds of protest ers for supporting a banned pro-Palestinian group during a demonstration. The protest went ahead despite official requests to cancel it.Authorities had urged organisers to call off the protest after a deadly attack at a synagogue in Manchester two days earlier.Two people were killed in Thursday’s attack in Manchester and police shot dead the murderer, a British man of Syrian origin who investigators believe may have been motivated by extremist Islamist ideology.Despite the appeal from police and the government, organisers refused to cancel Saturday’s march, which had been planned earlier to protest against the banning of Palestine Action under anti-terrorism laws, as reported by news agency Reuters.Prime Minister Keir Starmer in a post on X urged people to respect the grief of the Jewish community.“This is a moment of mourning. It is not a time to stoke tension and cause further pain.

Israel’s foreign minister Gideon Saar condemned the deadly terrorist attack that targeted a Manchester synagogue on Thursday, criticising UK authorities for what he described as their “failure to address this toxic wave of antisemitism.”“I am appalled by the murderous attack near Heaton Park Synagogue on the morning of Yom Kippur, the holiest day for the Jewish people. My deepest condolences go to the families who have lost loved ones, and I wish a swift recovery to the injured,” Saar said on X.He called for the “truth” to be told, adding: “Blatant and rampant antisemitic and anti-Israeli incitement, as well as support for terror, have recently become widespread in London, other UK cities, and on campuses.”Saar further said Israel expects “more than words” from the Keir Starmer-led government, demanding “effective action and enforcement against antisemitic and anti-Israeli sentiment in Britain.”The attack, carried out with a car and a knife, left two people dead and four injured. Police neutralised the suspect and arrested two others.The incident comes ahead of the second anniversary of Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attacks in Israel, after which Israel - a Jewish state - launched a military offensive in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip. Tensions between Israel and the UK have also grown following Britain’s recent recognition of a Palestinian state, along with several other Western nations.","Gideon Saar criticises UK authorities for what he described as their “failure to address this toxic wave of antisemitism’ The attack, carried out with a car and a knife, left two people dead and four injured.

US government shutdown: Education dept employees' out-of-office emails altered to blame Democrats; claim 'none of us contested',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-government-shutdown-education-dept-employees-out-of-office-emails-altered-to-blame-democrats-claim-none-of-us-contested/articleshow/124280514.cms,"



While the US government has already been shut down, some of the employees of the education department discovered their email accounts had been manipulated during their furlough this week.Five employees of the education department discovered that while they were out of the office, they had included partisan talking points that blamed the government shutdown on Democrats.The employees, who spoke with NBC News and provided copies of their out-of-office messages, reported that the wording had been altered from their original compositions. All are civil servants, not political appointees, and requested anonymity out of fear of professional repercussions.Initially, Education officials sent employees templates of nonpartisan out-of-office messages to use in their emails. Several employees stated they used this language earlier in the week, only to find that while they were furloughed, someone had changed it.“We’re looking to hear from federal government workers. If you’re willing to talk with us, please email us at tips@nbcuni.com or contact us through one of these methods,” one employee said.And now the altered email messages included statements such as: “Thank you for contacting me. On September 10-2025, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 5371, a clean continuing resolution. Unfortunately, Democrat Senators are blocking passage of H.R. 5371 in the Senate which has led to a lapse in appropriations. Due to the lapse of appropriations, I am currently in furlough status. I will respond to emails once government functions resume.”One individual reported changing the out-of-office message back to the nonpartisan version, only to have it revert to the partisan wording later.“None of us consented to this. And it’s written in the first person, as if I’m the one conveying this message, and I’m not. I don’t agree with it. I don’t think it’s ethical or legal. I think it violates the Hatch Act,” the employee stated, referring to the law that limits federal employees’ political activity.Another employee explained, “I took the statement that they sent us earlier in the week to use. And I pasted it on top of that — basically has a standard out-of-office. They went in and manipulated my out-of-office reply. I guess they’re now making us all guilty of violating the Hatch Act.”On Wednesday, NBC News reported that some employees at federal agencies were being offered partisan language blaming Democrats for the shutdown to use as their out-of-office messages. Additionally, several federal websites now display language targeting Democrats or the “radical left.” The Education Department’s actions have been criticised for involving individual civil servants in political messaging regardless of their personal views.Madi Biedermann, the deputy assistant secretary for communications, responded: “The email reminds those who reach out to Department of Education employees that we cannot respond because Senate Democrats are refusing to vote for a clean CR and fund the government. Where’s the lie?”One employee expressed frustration over the lack of accountability, stating, “Nobody follows the law anymore, so why does it matter? It seems like laws are dotted lines now, not solid lines. It seems there’s no one to hold this administration accountable to laws.” Regarding potential repercussions, the employee added, “Clearly, this wasn’t done by me; it was done while I was in a furlough status. I think I’d be able to argue that point. ”","Five employees of the education department discovered that while they were out of the office, they had included partisan talking points that blamed the government shutdown on Democrats.

Nepal Burns: Gen Z Protest Turns Deadly, 9 Killed as Police Open Fire in Kathmandu, Curfew Impsosed

Why is Moroccan youth protesting?





Moroccan protests driven by teenagers and internet-savvy youth has turned deadly as authorities on Thursday raised the death toll to 3 as violent youth-led demonstrations over corruption and public spending continue to rock the country.Morocco’s Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch praised the response of security forces and said the government was ready for talks, as organisers called for a sixth night of protests. “The death toll in the protests has risen to three,” Akhannouch said in a statement. ""We have unfortunately recorded the deaths of three people"" during the protests, Akhannouch said, describing the events as ""regrettable"", AFP reported.Local authorities reported that security forces had to resort to firearms after teargas failed to stop demonstrators from storming a police facility in Leqliaa, a small town outside Agadir. The group, armed with knives, set fire to part of the facility and to a vehicle.According to Morocco’s Interior Ministry, the three were shot and killed during an attempt to seize police weapons, although no witnesses could corroborate the report.The ministry added that 354 people, mostly law enforcement personnel, were injured, while hundreds of cars, banks, shops, and public buildings were damaged across 23 provinces.The protests dominated by Gen Z participants have taken Morocco by surprise. Demonstrators have voiced frustration over widespread corruption, contrasting the billions invested in preparations for the 2030 World Cup with underfunded schools and hospitals. Chants have included slogans such as, “Stadiums are here, but where are the hospitals?”The unrest has been further fueled by the recent deaths of eight women in a public hospital in Agadir, which has become a rallying cry against the decline of Morocco’s healthcare system.While the country prepares to host soccer's Africa Cup of Nations later this year and gears up for parliamentary elections in 2026, the protests highlight enduring regional disparities and dissatisfaction with public services, particularly among youth.Officials, however, denied that World Cup-related spending has taken precedence over public infrastructure, noting that many challenges facing the health sector were inherited from previous governments.","Morocco's Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch praised the response of security forces and said the government was ready for talks.

Federal judge temporarily halts Trump’s deployment







US President Donald Trump on Saturday authorised the deployment of 300 National Guard troops to Chicago to protect federal officers and assets, White House confirmed.The MAGA leader took the step after weeks of threatening action, despite objections from local leaders.""President Trump has authorized 300 national guardsmen to protect federal officers and assets,"" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said. ""President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities,"" she added.The decision follows an incident earlier Saturday in Chicago, where a federal officer shot an allegedly armed motorist.According to the department of homeland security (DHS), law enforcement agents were “boxed in by 10 cars” and could not move their vehicles. ""One of the drivers who rammed the law enforcement vehicle was armed with a semi-automatic weapon,"" DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said. ""Law enforcement was forced to deploy their weapons and fire defensive shots at an armed US citizen,"" she added.The motorist reportedly drove herself to the hospital to receive treatment for her wounds. McLaughlin also criticised Chicago police, accusing officers of ""leaving the shooting scene"" and refusing ""to assist us in securing the area.""Chicago police responded that officers attended the scene but said the department ""is not involved in the incident or its investigation. Federal authorities are investigating this shooting. ""The deployment to Chicago comes as Trump escalates his controversial anti-crime and migration operations in Democratic-run cities. Portland, Oregon, was the focus of a separate legal challenge. On Saturday, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order blocking the deployment of 200 National Guard troops to Portland.US District Judge Karin Immergut wrote that Trump’s determination to send troops to Portland “was simply untethered to the facts.” She said the city had seen attacks on federal officers and property, but these were not part of an organised effort to overthrow the government. Regular police could handle the incidents, she claimed.Portland and Chicago are the latest flashpoints in Trump’s national effort, marking another crackdown on Democratic-run states that has previously included deployments to Los Angeles and Washington.","US President Donald Trump authorised deployment of 300 National Guard troops to Chicago to protect federal officers and assets.

A federal judge in Oregon on Saturday issued a temporary restraining order blocking President Donald Trump from deploying 200 National Guard troops to Portland. The decision comes after Trump announced the deployment to protect what he described as a “war-ravaged” city, while a lawsuit challenging the move proceeds in court.The ruling by US District Judge Karin Immergut in Portland marks a setback for Trump, as he attempts to deploy military forces to cities he characterizes as “lawless,” despite opposition from their Democratic officials.In her ruling, Immergut stated that a trial court would likely side with the state’s argument that the president overstepped his constitutional authority by deploying federal troops for local matters, potentially violating the Tenth Amendment.Immergut questioned how much weight should be given to Trump’s social media descriptions of Portland and appeared doubtful about treating those posts as an official or legally binding assessment.""Really? A social media post is going to count as a presidential determination that you can send the National Guard to cities?"" she was quoted as saying by Reuters. ""I mean, is that really what I should be relying on as his determination?""In her order issued on Saturday, Immergut, a Trump appointee, noted that the temporary restraining order will remain in effect for 14 days, expiring on October 18.Immergut found that the timing of the president’s order failed to meet the legal standard for deploying the National Guard, noting that the state presented “substantial evidence that the protests at the Portland ICE facility were not significantly violent or disruptive in the days, or even weeks, leading up to the president's directive.”Democratic Oregon attorney general Dan Rayfield’s office filed the lawsuit on September 28, a day after Trump announced plans to deploy troops to Portland to guard federal immigration facilities from what he called “domestic terrorists.”While Trump described Portland as “war-ravaged,” Oregon officials countered that recent protests in the city were “small and sedate,” noting just 25 arrests in mid-June and none in the three-and-a-half months since June 19.""The president's perception of what is happening in Portland is not the reality on the ground,"" said Caroline Turco, representing Portland. ""The president's perception is that it is World War Two out here. The reality is that this is a beautiful city with a sophisticated police force that can handle the situation.""Trump has also authorized the deployment of 300 Illinois National Guard members to “protect federal officers and assets” in Chicago on Saturday, according to the White House. The move followed protests at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility near the city that resulted in more than a dozen arrests on Friday.The White House also accused state and local officials, including Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, of failing to address what it called “ongoing violent riots and lawlessness.”","A federal judge in Oregon on Saturday issued a temporary restraining order blocking President Donald Trump from deploying 200 National Guard troops to Portland.

The Trump administration plans to federalize 300 members of the Illinois National Guard, Democratic governor JB Pritzker said on Saturday. Pritzker said the state guard received word from the Pentagon on Saturday morning that the troops would be called up without specifying details on the timing or deployment location.“This morning, the Trump Administration’s Department of War gave me an ultimatum: call up your troops, or we will,” Pritzker said in a statement. “It is absolutely outrageous and un-American to demand a Governor send military troops within our own borders and against our will.”The governor’s office did not immediately respond to requests for further details. The White House and the Pentagon have also not commented on Pritzker’s statement.Trump’s move in Illinois follows similar deployments elsewhere. Over the summer, the President sent National Guard troops to Los Angeles and Washington, DC, as part of a broader federal law enforcement surge. Meanwhile, Tennessee National Guard troops are expected to assist Memphis police.California Governor Gavin Newsom successfully sued to halt the deployment in Los Angeles, winning a temporary block in federal court.The Trump administration has appealed, and a three-judge panel of the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals has indicated the government is likely to prevail.Pritzker dismissed the planned deployment in Illinois as a “manufactured performance,” arguing it would pull National Guard troops away from their families and regular jobs. “For Donald Trump, this has never been about safety. This is about control,” he said.He also noted that state, county, and local law enforcement agencies have been coordinating to protect the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Broadview facility on the outskirts of Chicago. Thirteen protesters were arrested on Friday near the facility, which has been a frequent target of demonstrations during the administration’s surge of immigration enforcement this fall.The planned federalization in Illinois comes amid a series of similar moves by Trump. Last month, he announced the deployment of federal troops to Portland, Oregon, calling the city “war-ravaged.” Local officials, however, have noted that many of Trump’s claims appear to rely on images from 2020, during unrest following George Floyd’s death. City and state officials immediately filed a lawsuit to block the deployment. US District Judge Karin J. Immergut heard arguments on Friday, with a ruling expected over the weekend.So far, 200 National Guard troops have been federalized in Oregon, but they have reportedly remained on the coast for training and have not yet moved into Portland.",Illinois governor JB Pritzker said the state guard received word from the Pentagon on Saturday morning that the troops would be called up.

A massive chaos unfolded in Chicago Saturday when US Border Patrol agents shot a woman claiming that it was in self defense as the woman was armed with a semi-automatic weapon and was trying to attack the agents. The agents said they were rammed by 10 cars as they were patrolling. The woman was in one of those cars, driving.The woman was already known to the federal agency for allegedly publicly identifying agents and encouraging people to attack them, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said.The shooting was reported at around 10:30 a.m. near the intersection of South California Avenue and West 35th Street in the city’s Brighton Park neighborhood. ""Agents were unable to move their vehicle and exited the car,"" Tricia said.Protests have occurred in recent days as part of an immigration enforcement effort called ""Operation Midway Blitz,"" which has seen more than 1,000 arrests. Agents have been raiding houses, landing on rooftops from their helicopters and breaking down doors in an operation the Trump administration said targeted gang members of Tren de Aragua, citing a rise in crime.There have also been arrests of local officials and candidates for office who were protesting, including Illinois’ ninth congressional district Kat Abughazaleh, who went viral with a video of an ICE agent slamming her to the ground.Kristi Noem was seen at an ICE facility Friday when law enforcement was cracking down on protesters.Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker accused the federal agents of separating children from their parents, tying their hands, and detaining them in “dark vans” for hours. Videos and photos showing flashbang grenades erupting on the street, followed by residents of the building being led to a parking lot across the street going viral on social media drawing condemnation.“Military-style tactics should never be used on children in a functioning democracy,” Pritzker said in a statement on Friday. “This didn’t happen in a country with an authoritarian regime; it happened here in Chicago.

India Won't Hold Back in Operation Sindoor 2.0: Army Chief Dwivedi Sends Clear Message To Pakistan





ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Army on Saturday criticised the recent remarks made by the Indian military officers and political leaders, warning that a future conflict between the two countries might lead to a ""cataclysmic devastation"".In a statement, it also said that these ""irresponsible statements"" indicate a renewed attempt at ""fabricating arbitrary pretexts for aggression"" - a prospect which might ""lead to serious consequences"" for peace and stability in South Asia.A day earlier, defence minister Rajnath Singh had said India can cross any border whenever necessary to protect citizens and safeguard India's unity and integrity. Indian Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi on Friday issued a stern warning to Pakistan , saying the neighbouring country should stop sponsoring terrorism on its soil if it wants to retain its place on the world map.General Dwivedi also said the restraint shown by New Delhi during Operation Sindoor would not be repeated in case of a future military conflict and urged Indian soldiers to remain poised for action.Also, chief of air staff Air Chief Marshal A P Singh on Friday said that at least a dozen Pakistani military aircraft, including US-origin F-16 jets, were destroyed or damaged in Indian strikes during Operation Sindoor.In its statement, the Pakistan Army said that it noted with ""grave concern"" the ""delusional, provocative and jingoistic statements"" coming from the highest levels of the Indian security establishment.""In the face of highly provocative statements of the Indian Defence Minister and its Army and Air Chiefs, we caution that a future conflict might lead to cataclysmic devastation. In case a fresh round of hostilities is triggered, Pakistan shall not hold back. We shall resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint,"" it said.The statement said that Pakistan has established a ""new normal of response"", which will be ""swift, decisive and destructive"".It added that the armed forces of Pakistan have the capability and resolve ""to take the fight to every nook and corner of the enemy's territory"".The statement also responded to the threat of ""erasing Pakistan from the map"", saying India ""must know that if a situation comes, the erasure will be mutual"".It also said that earlier this year, the Indian attack against Pakistan brought two nuclear powers to the brink of a major war. ""...India now seems to be aching for the next round of confrontation,"" it added.In response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in territories controlled by Pakistan.The strikes triggered four days of intense clashes that ended with an understanding on stopping the military actions on May 10.On Thursday, defence minister Singh said any misadventure by Islamabad in the Sir Creek sector will invite a ""decisive response"" that could be strong enough to change both ""history and geography"".Sir Creek is a 96-km-long tidal estuary between Gujarat's Rann of Kutch and Pakistan and is considered a disputed region due to varying interpretations of maritime boundary lines by both sides.

"'Gratitude is due ...': Pakistan takes a U-turn; after Dar's objection, PM Shehbaz hails Trump's Gaza peace plan",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/gratitude-is-due-pakistan-takes-a-u-turn-after-dars-objection-pm-shehbaz-hails-trumps-gaza-peace-plan/articleshow/124307025.cms,"‘They Back This 100%’: Trump Hails Pakistan’s Strong Stand on Gaza Deal





A day after Pakistan 's foreign minister Ishaq Dar said that Donald Trump 's Gaza peace plan was not endorsed by Pakistan, Prime minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday hailed US President's plan calling it a ""step towards ending bloodshed.""In a social media post on X, Shehbaz thanked Trump and leaders of Arab and Muslim states for their efforts to bring peace in Palestine.“Alhamdolillah, we are closer to a ceasefire than we have been since this genocide was launched on the Palestinian people. Pakistan has always stood by the Palestinian people and shall always do so,” Shehbaz said.""Gratitude is due to President Trump, as well as to leaderships of Qatar, Saudia Arabia, UAE, Turkiye, Jordan, Egypt, and Indonesia who, met with President Trump on the sidelines of #UNGA80 for the resolution of the Palestinian issue. The statement issued by Hamas creates a window for a ceasefire and ensuring peace that we must not allow to close again. InshaAllah, Pakistan will continue to work with all its partners and brotherly nations to everlasting peace in Palestine,"" he added.Shehbaz took a U-turn as his deputy Dar had claimed that Trump’s version of the peace plan was not the one proposed by the bloc of eight Muslim-majority nations that met the US president on September 22 on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.“I made it clear that the 20 points that President Trump made public are not ours. Changes were made to our draft. I have the record,” Dar said, emphasising that “there is no room for politicking” on the issue.Dar explained that the plan took shape during a meeting between Trump and foreign ministers of eight countries - Pakistan, Jordan, the UAE, Indonesia, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt - on the sidelines of the 80th UN General Assembly session. He said the group had prepared a counter-draft to the US proposal, focusing on an immediate ceasefire, humanitarian aid, and an end to the ongoing bloodshed in Gaza.Dar also reaffirmed that Pakistan will never recognise Israel and continues to back the two-state solution based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al Sharif (Jerusalem) as the capital of a future Palestinian state. He stressed that Pakistan’s stance remains unchanged.Dar also confirmed that the plan envisions deploying an international peacekeeping force in Palestine, and said Pakistan’s leadership would soon decide on contributing troops.Under Donald Trump’s proposed plan, military operations in Gaza would be suspended, existing battle lines would remain in place, and a temporary “technocratic, non-political” Palestinian administration would be established. The plan also calls for creating a “Board of Peace,” chaired by Trump, with former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair reportedly serving as an adviser.On Friday, Trump said Hamas must accept the proposed Gaza peace plan by Sunday, warning that failure to do so would result in further attacks.This comes as Hamas accepted some elements of Trump's plan to end the nearly two-year war and return all the remaining hostages taken in the October 7, 2023, attack.Hamas said it was willing to release the hostages and hand over power to other Palestinians, but that other aspects of the plan require further consultations among Palestinians. Senior Hamas officials suggested there were still major disagreements that required further negotiations.","Prime minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday hailed US President's plan calling it a ""step towards ending bloodshed"" On Friday, Pakistan's foreign minister Ishaq Dar said that Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan was not endorsed by Pakistan.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124307060,imgsize-660599,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

At Least 24 Killed As Pakistan Air Force Bombs Tirah Village In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa





At least four students were injured when a bomb exploded inside a private school in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, northwestern Pakistan, authorities said on Saturday.According to the school administration, a fourth-grade student picked up a “toy bomb” on his way to school in Jamrud tehsil, Khyber district, near the Afghan border and brought it into his classroom on Friday.Local authorities explained that “toy bombs” are actually abandoned mortar shells found in the province, especially near the Afghan border, which children often mistake for toys. The bomb exploded when the student dropped it on the classroom floor.The injured students were immediately taken to a hospital in Peshawar for treatment and were later discharged, news agency PTI reported.Security forces have blocked off the area and launched a search operation to locate and defuse any remaining unexploded shells to prevent further accidents. Police have also initiated an investigation into the incident.Incidents involving abandoned mortar shells are common in the region. Last year, on December 27, four boys were killed and two critically injured when an old mortar shell exploded in Bajaur district.Such devices continue to pose serious risks to local communities, particularly children, in heavily mined tribal areas along the Afghanistan border.","At least four students were injured when a bomb exploded inside a private school in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, northwestern Pakistan.
