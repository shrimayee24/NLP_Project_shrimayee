'You rose to power promising a secular rule': Muslim body declines Bihar CM Nitish Kumar’s Iftaar invitation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/you-rose-to-power-promising-a-secular-rule-muslim-body-declines-bihar-cm-nitish-kumars-iftaar-invitation/articleshow/119361879.cms,"PTI photo

A major Muslim organisation in Bihar, the Imarat Shariah, has declined Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s invitation for an Iftaar gathering on Sunday.The group, which has a strong following in Bihar, Jharkhand, and Odisha, cited Kumar’s support for the Waqf Bill as the reason. They claim the bill will worsen the economic and educational conditions of Muslims.In a letter responding to the invitation, the Imarat Shariah said, “A decision has been taken not to attend the government Iftaar on March 23. This decision is in protest against your support for the Waqf Bill, which threatens to increase the backwardness of Muslims,” quoted PTI.The organisation accused Kumar of breaking his promise to protect minority rights. ""You rose to power promising a secular rule in which minorities' rights were protected. But your alliance with the BJP and your support for legislation that is unconstitutional and illogical militate against your stated commitments,"" the Imarat Shariah alleged.The Imarat Shariah further criticised the Iftaar event, calling it “tokenism.” It claimed that the government’s indifference to Muslim concerns made such events meaningless.The JD(U) has traditionally counted on Muslim votes by presenting Kumar as a secular leader. The state elections are scheduled for later this year.The Janata Dal (United), has not responded to the boycott yet.The Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind had announced on Friday that it will no longer engage with such individuals as a ""symbolic protest."" The organisation also said that it will not take part in their events, including Iftaar and Eid Milan.The Waqf (Amendment) Bill is set to be presented in the Lok Sabha next week. The proposed changes aim to update the Waqf system. Key provisions include tighter regulations on the registration and oversight of Waqf properties.One of the most controversial aspects of the bill is the change in ownership rules, which would affect historical mosques, dargahs, and graveyards managed by the board.","The Imarat Shariah, a major Muslim organisation in Bihar, has declined Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s invitation for an Iftaar gathering on Sunday.

NAGPUR: A 38-year-old welder died Saturday from wounds suffered in Monday night's riots in Nagpur, becoming the first fatality linked to the violence over demands to remove Mughal emperor Aurangzeb's tomb from Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar.Sources said Irfan Shafiq Ahmed Ansari from Bande Garib Nawaz Nagar was caught in the crossfire while heading to Itwari station. His family demanded murder charges against rioters and compensation. CM Devendra Fadnavis promised strict action against rioters, including recovering the cost of property damage from them.Irfan Shafiq Ahmed Ansari, who was injured in the crossfire during the Nagpur riots, was found critically wounded and was taken by senior inspector Sanjay Singh to a hospital. Govt covered medical expenses of Ansari.Two men accused in Ansari's assault have been arrested. CM Devendra Fadnavis promised strict action against rioters and stone-throwers, including recovering the cost of property damage from them. ""We will survey the damages and pay compensation to those whose vehicles or properties were damaged. The money will be disbursed in a week, but we will ensure it's collected from the rioters,"" he said. ""If they fail to pay up, their properties will be seized and sold to recover losses.""Fadnavis reviewed the law-and-order situation in affected areas and suggested a connection between the Nagpur riots and Malegaon, saying authorities were investigating involvement of international elements. He said PM Modi's scheduled visit to Nagpur for Gudi Padwa would proceed as planned.Police arrested alleged riot mastermind Fahim Khan's mentor M Hamid Engineer, president of Minorities Democratic Party, and web portal journalist Mohd Shahzad. Both were held late Friday night for allegedly inciting the riots and charged with sedition.Police sources said Engineer has provided leads regarding the Malegaon link mentioned by Fadnavis. Engineer, a long-time figure in minority politics, had allegedly flooded social media with inflammatory posts before the riots.His online appeal for contributions to ""Mujahideen"" raised speculation about his role in inciting violence in Nagpur. Engineer had been arrested earlier in 2011 for his alleged role in the Mominpura mob violence. Shahzad had circulated a speech by Khan that went viral. Both men were remanded in police custody for three days.A special committee from opposition Congress accused state govt and police of conducting a biased investigation, alleging that groups affiliated with the governing alliance were receiving ""silent support"" to incite violence.The delegation was denied permission Saturday to visit the riot-affected areas and warned of legal action if they defied the order. ""CM says it was a conspiracy. If so, then what was your law-and-order machinery doing? CM must resign, or the governor must dismiss this govt,"" Congress' Manikrao Thakre said.","Irfan Shafiq Ahmed Ansari was caught in the crossfire while heading to Itwari station.

He said that on being shown the video and asked about the source of the money and explanation about its presence in his official bungalow, Justice Varma expressed ""some apprehension about conspiracy against him"". The Delhi CJ concluded by saying , "" I am of the prima facie opinion that the entire matter warrants a deeper probe.""The CJI had also asked Delhi HC CJ to ascertain ""details of the official staff of the HC Registry, the personal security officers and the security guards who were posted at the residence of Justice Varma during the last six months.

As regards IPDR, the same shall be furnished to you as soon as it is received from the commissioner of police, Delhi/mobile service provider""Maintaining that he was innocence, Justice Varma wrote: ""I state unequivocally that no cash was ever placed in that storeroom either by me or any of my family members and strongly denounce the suggestion that the alleged cash belonged to us. The very idea or suggestion that this cash was kept or stored by us is totally preposterous. The suggestion that one would store cash in an open, freely accessible and commonly used storeroom near the staff quarters or in an outhouse verges on the incredible and incredulous.""On the video of the cash on his residential premises, Justice Varma said, ""I was totally shocked to see the contents of the video since that depicted something, which was not found on site as I had seen it. It was this that prompted me to observe that this clearly appeared to be a conspiracy to frame and malign me. It also lends credence to my firm belief that the entire incident is part of a sequence of events, which occurred in the recent past, including the unfounded allegations that circulated on social media in Dec 2024.""He added: ""What baffles me is the complete absence of any sacks of allegedly burnt currency that were ever recovered or seized. We categorically assert that neither my daughter, PS nor household staff were shown these so-called sacks of burnt currency,"" he said.","A video that Delhi Police commissioner Sanjay Arora shared with CJI I Sanjiv Khanna and Delhi HC CJ D K Upadhyay, purportedly revealing burnt cash at Justice Yashwant Varma's house on March 14, appears to have clinched the case for a deeper probe.

""Where did she find the courage to kill her husband and leave so easily? She is roaming freely with her lover. Who is he? Where did she go with him? There must have been some planning behind this. She did not act alone,"" she added.Demanding the death penalty for those involved, she said, ""Those responsible for my son's murder should be hanged. I appeal to Modi ji and Yogi ji for justice.

I need all the answers.""Saurabh's mother also questioned the events leading up to the murder. ""If my son had been facing such serious problems, he would have told me something.

CBI closure reports in 2 cases tied to Rajput death filed in Patna, Mumbai

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: Four-and-a half years after it began probing the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput , the CBI is learned to have closed the case and given a clean chit to actor Rhea Chakraborty , bringing curtains on a case that had gripped the country, reports Rajshekhar Jha. Rajput was found dead at his Bandra flat on June 14, 2020.The probe agency is learned to have filed a closure report in two of the cases it was investigating, sources said. While one case was filed in Aug 2021 in Patna by Rajput's father against Rhea, her kin and others, the other was filed in Sept by Rhea against Rajput's sister and doctor.The closure report in both was filed in a special Mumbai court, sources said.Rhea's lawyer Satish Maneshinde said, ""Rhea Chakraborty had to undergo untold miseries and was behind bars for 27 days for no fault of hers until Justice Sarang V Kotwal released her on bail. I salute her and her family for having kept silent and yet suffered the inhuman treatment they were meted out. Innocent people were hounded and paraded before the media and investigative authorities. I hope this does not repeat in any case.""Rajput was found dead 6 days after his PR manager Disha Salian fell off the 14th floor of a Malad tower and died.Rajput was found dead at his Bandra apartment on June 14, 2020, six days after his PR manager Disha Salian died. Mumbai police , which first probed the case, termed it as a case of suspected suicide, although no suicide note had been found. The provisional post-mortem suggested the cause of death was asphyxia due to hanging.Coincidentally, on Wednesday, Disha's father Satish Salian alleged his daughter was gangraped and murdered. He has filed a plea demanding a CBI probe into her death, alleging that Rajput was visibly frightened and repeatedly expressed fear that ""those people"" responsible for her death would not spare him and that he would be killed. He has said both deaths are interconnected and part of a larger conspiracy.The CBI FIR in Rajput's case named Rhea and her kin Indrajit Chakraborty, Sandhya and Showik apart from her associates Samuel Miranda and Shruti Modi.The FIR, initially filed by Bihar police , had sections of IPC related to criminal conspiracy, abetment of suicide, wrongful restraint, wrongful confinement, theft, criminal breach of trust, cheating and criminal intimidation.After Rajput's cremation at Vile Parle's Pawan Hans crematorium, Mumbai police began their investigation, recording statements from film and casting director Mukesh Chhabra, Rajput's girlfriend Rhea, and his managerial staff. In July that year, producer Sanjay Leela Bhansali was questioned, stating he had offered Rajput four films, but eventually featured in none.Rhea, who confirmed being in a relationship with Rajput on Twitter (now X), demanded a CBI inquiry. Mumbai police also recorded statements of filmmaker Aditya Chopra and three psychiatrists.Meanwhile, an FIR was registered against Rhea in Patna on July 28, and a team of Bihar police reached Mumbai to probe the case.The Enforcement Directorate inquired about the money laundering angle in the case and questioned Rhea but they found no substance against her. Subsequently, the NCB initiated a probe against her along with others on allegations of procurement of drugs for Rajput which led to her arrest. In Aug 2021, the CBI filed an FIR against Rhea and others, and the ED too summoned her for questioning.An AIIMS forensic team was roped in by the CBI on Aug 22, and the ED unearthed a drug angle in the case, involving the Narcotics Control Bureau .In Sept 2021, Rhea filed an FIR against Rajput's sisters and doctor, which was transferred to the CBI as well.This is the second case which has been closed as well, sources said.In Oct, reports emerged that the AIIMS panel had dismissed the murder theory, although the CBI stated they were probing all angles.","CBI closes actor Sushant Singh Rajput death case, clears Rhea Chakraborty.

Terry Bradshaw’s political shift: Why the NFL legend chose to stay neutral



Terry Bradshaw , the legendary NFL quarterback turned television personality, has taken a rare path in the often politically charged landscape of professional sports. While numerous celebrities and sports figures have openly voiced their political opinions, especially since Donald Trump ’s initial presidential campaign a decade ago, Bradshaw has opted for a more reserved approach. Unlike several high-profile NFL names who have publicly backed Trump, Bradshaw has consciously chosen to remain politically neutral—a stance that reflects both his evolving political beliefs and his desire to avoid alienating fans.Donald Trump has received notable endorsements from influential NFL figures, including Hall of Fame quarterbacks Brett Favre, John Elway, and Fran Tarkenton. Current NFL stars like Nick Bosa, Gardner Minshew II, and Harrison Butker have also shown public support for the former president. However, at 76, Terry Bradshaw has stood apart by choosing not to align himself with any political party.In a 2020 interview with Business Jet Traveler, Bradshaw opened up about his political shift. After being a longtime Republican, Bradshaw made the decision to switch political parties and register as an Independent. His reasoning was straightforward and pragmatic: ""I've been a Republican, but now I'm a registered independent. I don't want to alienate anyone, and the minute you say, 'I'm a Democrat' or 'I'm Republican,' you're kicking off the other side. I want the best person [in the White House], and I'll pick the one who's most like the way I feel.""Bradshaw’s move reflects his desire to remain open-minded and focused on leadership qualities rather than party loyalty. His switch mirrors a growing sentiment among public figures who feel constrained by rigid political affiliations. Notably, other athletes like Danica Patrick and Charles Barkley have also made similar moves in recent years.While Bradshaw has generally avoided taking sides, he has not shied away from criticizing political decisions when he feels compelled to speak out. One of the most notable instances came during Donald Trump's presidency when the former president condemned NFL players for kneeling during the national anthem as a form of protest. Bradshaw was vocal in defending the players' right to protest, emphasizing the core values of American freedom.""This is America. If our country stands for anything, folks, it's freedom. People died for that freedom. I'm not sure if our President understands those rights—that every American has the right to speak out and to protest. Believe me, these athletes do love this great country of ours,"" Bradshaw stated. He further added, ""Personally, I think our President should concentrate on North Korea and healthcare rather than ripping into athletes and the NFL.""Bradshaw’s remarks underscored his belief in free expression and the importance of focusing on larger national issues rather than politicizing sports. His balanced approach allows him to maintain credibility and connection with a broad audience, avoiding the divisiveness that often comes with strong political statements.Despite his political shift, Bradshaw remains a prominent figure in the NFL world. As a key part of FOX’s broadcasting team, he continues to be a familiar face to football fans every week. While his longtime colleague Jimmy Johnson has decided to retire, Bradshaw intends to stay on air at least until FOX’s next Super Bowl broadcast.Also Read: ""Please be true"": Excited Joe Burrow fuels buzz over Bengals’ possible 2025 international appearance Bradshaw’s decision to remain politically independent reflects a thoughtful, measured stance in a time when public figures face increasing pressure to declare their allegiances. By prioritizing leadership over party loyalty, Bradshaw has set an example of focusing on unity rather than division—a stance that resonates with both sports fans and beyond.","Terry Bradshaw has chosen to remain politically neutral.

'She should be hanged': Parents of Muskan

MEERUT: Muskan Rastogi, accused of brutally murdering her husband, former merchant navy officer Saurabh Rajput, has been showing signs of distress. She has been eating very little, often sitting alone in a corner, and demanding injections. Meanwhile, her co-accused and lover, Sahil Shukla , is restless due to the lack of marijuana, a jail official said on Saturday.Since their arrival at Meerut District Jail on March 19, both undertrials have been lodged in separate barracks—about 1.5 km apart. Struggling with severe withdrawal symptoms from drug addiction, they are under constant medical supervision to prevent their condition from worsening.Their request to be placed in close proximity has been denied, and so far, none of their immediate family members have visited them.""They have been confined in separate barracks—Muskan in barrack 12, designated for women undertrials and Sahil in barrack 18 at the prison’s reception centre. A medical team is administering anti-addiction medicines and it will take about 10 days for them to adjust to the new environment,"" the official said.Meerut SSP Dr. Vipin Tada stated that efforts are underway to have the case heard in a fast-track court . Investigations revealed that Sahil and Muskan had been using drugs for years, especially after reconnecting in 2019.Authorities also uncovered disturbing details about Sahil’s living space, which was filled with tantric symbols , satanic graffiti, and cryptic messages—suggesting an obsession with black magic .Saurabh Rajput, a former merchant navy officer, returned to Meerut from London on February 24 to surprise his wife on her birthday, unaware that he was walking into a death trap. By the time his absence raised suspicions, he had already been drugged, murdered, beheaded, and left to decompose in a plastic drum for nearly two weeks.The gruesome crime, committed on March 4, was uncovered only on Tuesday.SP (City) Ayush Vikram Singh revealed that Muskan had been planning the murder since November. ""She manipulated Sahil by sending fake Snapchat messages, making him believe they were signs from his deceased mother. In the days leading up to Saurabh’s return, she purchased two knives, claiming they were for cutting chicken, and pretended to have anxiety to acquire sedatives, which she later used to drug her husband before the killing.""According to Singh, Muskan preyed on Sahil’s grief, convincing him that his late mother had reincarnated and was guiding him to murder Saurabh. ""She also misled Sahil by claiming that Saurabh was not in the merchant navy but working in a bakery in London. These claims are still being verified,"" he added.Both Muskan and Sahil have been charged with murder and destruction of evidence.Muskan’s parents have disowned her, demanding the harshest punishment. ""That boy (Saurabh) was a good man. We want justice and demand she be hanged,"" her mother told ANI.Her father echoed the same, stating, ""My daughter murdered her husband. She is a threat to society. I urge others not to make such mistakes.

Venezuela to resume repatriation flights from the US after agreement,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/venezuela-to-resume-repatriation-flights-from-the-us-after-agreement/articleshow/119364534.cms,"Venezuela agreed to resume repatriation flights carrying deported nationals from the United States after an agreement between the two nations. The decision comes after a temporary halt imposed by Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro earlier this month.Jorge Rodríguez, president of Venezuela’s national assembly and Maduro’s chief negotiator with the US, announced the decision on social media.“We have agreed with the US government to resume the repatriation of Venezuelan migrants with an initial flight tomorrow, Sunday,” Rodríguez said. He added that the move aims to ensure “the return of our compatriots to their nation with the safeguard of their human rights.”The repatriation programme was suspended on 8 March after the US treasury department revoked Chevron’s license to export Venezuelan oil. However, tensions appear to have eased, allowing flights to resume.Rodríguez also criticised the deportation of approximately 250 Venezuelans to a high-security prison in El Salvador under US President Donald Trump’s administration.“Migrating is not a crime and we will not rest until we achieve the return of all those who require it and until we rescue our brothers kidnapped in El Salvador,” he said.Later in the day, Maduro reaffirmed the government’s commitment to repatriation during a public event.“We are resuming flights to rescue and release migrants from US prisons,” he declared, while holding El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele responsible for the well-being of the deported Venezuelans .“You guarantee their health, and sooner rather than later, you have to hand them over and release them, because they are kidnapped,” Maduro said.Trump’s administration had claimed that the deported individuals were members of Tren de Aragua , a notorious Venezuelan criminal gang. On 15 March, Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act, an 18th-century law allowing the deportation of non-citizens during wartime, labelling the gang an “invading force.”However, a federal judge temporarily blocked the deportations while some flights were already in transit.The United States department of homeland security (DHS) announced revocation of legal safeguards for around 532,000 individuals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, who have been in the US since October 2022.These immigrants, who entered America with financial sponsors and received two-year residency and work permits, will lose their legal status on April 24, or 30 days after the Federal Register publishes the notice.The US department of state has designated Tren de Aragua a foreign terrorist organisation. The gang originated in Venezuelan prisons and spread as millions of Venezuelans fled the country’s economic collapse.Despite Trump’s claims, his administration has yet to provide evidence linking the deportees to the gang or proving they committed crimes in the US.",The repatriation programme was suspended on 8 March after the US treasury department revoked Chevron’s license to export Venezuelan oil.

Evidence suggested the child had been deceased for hours before the emergency call. A kitchen knife, purchased the previous day, was found in the room. After hospital treatment for ingesting unknown substances, Ramaraju was arrested on Thursday.“The life of a child should not hang in the balance between two parents whose anger for each other outweighs their love for their child,” said Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer. “Anger makes you forget who you love and what you are responsible for doing. The safest place for a child should be in their parents’ arms. Instead of wrapping her arms around their son in love, she slit his throat and in the cruelest twist of fate removed him from the very world she brought him into.”The deceased child was identified as Yatin Ramaraju by NBC Los Angeles. The report revealed ongoing custody disputes between Saritha Ramaraju and Prakash Raju since the previous year. She had claimed he made unilateral decisions regarding medical care and schooling, also alleging substance abuse issues.Court documents showed Prakash Raju originated from Bengaluru, India. Following their January 2018 divorce, he received custody while she maintained visitation rights.","Saritha Ramaraju, 48, accused of slitting her son's throat after they went on a vacation to Disneyland during a custody visit.

TORONTO: New Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney will run in an Ottawa area district as he seeks to join Parliament for the first time, two officials familiar with the matter said Saturday, a day before Carney triggers an early general election before a vote on April 28.The election will take place against the backdrop of a trade war and sovereignty threats from U.S. President Donald Trump.The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly, said Carney will run to represent the suburban Ottawa area of Nepean.The election campaign for 343 seats or districts in the House of Commons will last 37 days.The party that commands a majority in the House of Commons, either alone or with the support of another party, will form the next government and its leader will be prime minister.Carney replaced Justin Trudeau, who announced his resignation in January, but remained in power until the Liberal Party elected a new leader on March 9 following a leadership race by the governing party.Carney, sworn in as Canada's 24th prime minister on March 14, has said the government in a time of crisis needs a strong and clear mandate.The governing Liberals had appeared poised for a historic election defeat this year until Trump declared a trade war. Trump has repeatedly said that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state and he acknowledged Friday that he has upended Canadian politics.What Trump hasn't said is that the almost daily attacks on Canada's sovereignty have infuriated Canadians. That has led to a surge in Canadian nationalism that has bolstered Liberal poll numbers.The opposition Conservatives hoped to make the election about Trudeau, whose popularity declined as food and housing prices rose and immigration surged. But after decades of bilateral stability, the vote is now is expected to focus on who is best equipped to deal with Trump.Trump put 25% tariffs on Canada's steel and aluminum and is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products - as well as all of America's trading partners - on April 2.Carney still hasn't had a phone call with Trump and that might not happen now until after the election. Trump mocked Trudeau by calling him governor, but he has not yet mentioned Carney's name.Carney, 60, was the head of the Bank of Canada during the 2008 financial crisis. In 2013, he became the first noncitizen of the United Kingdom to run the Bank of England - helping to manage the impact of Brexit.Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the Conservatives, is Carney's main challenger. The party and Poilievre were heading for a huge victory in Canada's federal election this year until Trump's near-daily trade and annexation threats derailed them.Poilievre, 45, for years the party's go-to attack dog, is a career politician and firebrand populist who says he will put ""Canada first."" He attacks the mainstream media and vows to defund Canada's public broadcaster. His party announced that it won't allow media onboard his campaign buses and planes.",New Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney will run in an Ottawa area district as he seeks to join Parliament for the first time.

Errol Musk , father of billionaire Elon Musk , recently defended his son against accusations of racism by highlighting the family's relationship with Black domestic staff during apartheid-era South Africa.Speaking to The Washington Post, the 79-year-old claimed his children were uninterested in ""political nonsense"" despite being raised under a system of racial segregation. ""We had several black servants who were their friends,"" Errol Musk told the newspaper, in response to questions about Elon Musk's opposition to workplace diversity and equity programs.The elder Musk portrayed South Africa during his children's upbringing as a ""well-run, law-abiding country with virtually no crime at all.""Errol Musk also acknowledged importing emeralds from an unregistered Zambian mine during the apartheid era, telling The Washington Post that the operation ""helped me and my two boys sustain ourselves during the collapse of Apartheid"" in South Africa. While Elon Musk initially referenced the family's involvement with the mine in a 2014 interview, he later sought to distance himself from it. In a 2021 tweet, he denied the mine's existence, claiming he arrived in Canada in 1989 with only $2,500 Canadian dollars, took on $100,000 in student debt, and independently built his first business using his personal computer.Biographer Walter Isaacson and reporting from Business Insider claimed that Errol Musk did not own the mine but did profit from emerald imports. Errol justified the use of an unregistered mine by saying, ""you would wind up with nothing because the Blacks would take everything from you,"" according to Isaacson.Critics argue that Musk's privileged background shielded him from the realities of apartheid. Rudolph Pienaar, a former schoolmate, described Elon's childhood as a ""bubble of entitlement,"" telling The Washington Post, ""I am not sure if Elon can conceive of systematic discrimination and struggle because that's not his experience. His life now in some ways is how it was under apartheid—rich and entitled with the entire society built to sustain him and his ilk.""Elon Musk's public image has faced further scrutiny since his 2022 acquisition of Twitter (now X), particularly as the platform's policy changes have allowed the spread of extremist content. NBC News alleged that verified accounts on X were able to share pro-Nazi material, including Adolf Hitler's speeches. Musk's right-wing associations have drawn increasing attention, particularly after he was seen making a gesture during Donald Trump 's second-term inauguration that some interpreted as a ""Nazi"" salute—though his supporters argued it was a ""Roman"" salute. Musk dismissed these accusations on X with a post that included wordplay referencing Nazi officials' names.Musk is facing accusations of hostility toward diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, calling them the ""woke mind virus."" His recent criticism of DEI job listings in the UK's NHS sparked backlash and raised concerns among US educators.At the World Governments Summit in Dubai, Musk urged the US to ""delete entire agencies"" under President Trump to cut spending and reshape government priorities, arguing that merely scaling back would allow them to regrow.Musk’s influence in Washington is growing, particularly within the Department of Government Efficiency, where he has reportedly sidelined career officials and gained access to sensitive federal data. He also supports Trump’s isolationist foreign policy, questioning agencies like USAID.Musk further stirred controversy by linking DEI to artificial intelligence, suggesting AI focused on ""diversity at all costs"" could eliminate men in power. Meanwhile, he announced new projects, including X’s AI chatbot Grok 3 and a ""Dubai Loop"" transportation system.",Errol Musk defended his son against accusations of racism by highlighting the family's relationship with Black domestic staff during apartheid-era South Africa.

She said she was told that she was in the wrong place and that she should have gone to a US consulate.

After 12 days of detention, she was finally released and allowed to fly back to Canada.In a massive crackdown on illegal immigrants, the Trump administration has been on an arrest spree.

TOI Correspondent from Washington:

A federal judge on Thursday blocked the Trump administration's effort to deport Badar Khan Suri , an Indian post-doc fellow at Georgetown University who has been detained by immigration authorities for alleged pro-Hamas activism, saying he should not removed from the US pending the outcome of the legal challenge seeking his release.Virginia Eastern District Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles did not rule on the merits of the deportation case itself but suggested Suri's habeas corpus needs to be heard first in an order stating he ""shall not be removed from the U.S unless and until the Court issues a contrary order.""Suri's attorney has said his client was abducted from his apartment in Rosslyn, Virginia, a suburb outside Washington DC, and is incarcerated in distant Louisiana, where the Syria-born Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil has also been imprisoned at a different facility.Khalil's attorneys too are fighting his deportation, and after accusing authorities of moving their client to a more conservative jurisdiction (Louisiana is a deep red Republican state), they got the case transferred to New Jersey.The detentions follow a Trump crackdown on liberal campuses where student activists have been protesting and criticizing -- both directly and on social media -- U.S foreign policy with regards to the Israel-Palestinian issue.The Trump administration says foreign students, even if they have Green cards and valid visas, are violating terms of their stay with political activism that pose a threat to US national security. Administration officials have warned that many more foreign student activists will be identified and deported.Free speech advocates maintain the administration's actions are a violation of the First Amendment, even with regards to foreign scholars, with some recalling campus anti-Vietnam war protests in the 1960s. “Badar Khan Suri’s detention is a clear violation of his constitutional rights, and he must be released,” Virginia Democrat lawmaker Don Beyer said Thursday, adding, “The ‘justification’ given for these violations of Mr. Suri’s right to due process is another violation of the Constitution: a blatant attack on the First Amendment.""The judicial interventions that are stalling the deportations has enraged President Trump, who says lawyers ""endlessly search"" for "" radical left judges "" to thwart the administration's effort to deport dangerous illegal immigrants, although the crackdown now targets even legal residents.According to a rough count by legal mavens, Out of 679 active federal district court judges, 384 were appointed by Democratic presidents, and 257 appointed by Republican presidents. In the Appeals Court, out of 179 active judges, 88 were appointed by Democratic presidents, and 89 were appointed by Republican presidents. Six of the nine Supreme Court judges have been appointed by Republican Presidents, including three by Trump.But the US President and his acolytes, including Elon Musk, are still unhappy and want Roberts to sign off on moves to impeach liberal justices balking at an imperial presidency they are aiming for, where the President's authority is unquestioned. Roberts, who has suggested the administration can go through with the appeals process rather than target the judges.In a series of posts, Trump raged that ""Unlawful Nationwide Injunctions by Radical Left Judges could very well lead to the destruction of our Country!""""These people are Lunatics, who do not care, even a little bit, about the repercussions from their very dangerous and incorrect Decisions and Rulings,"" Trump fumed, adding that ""No District Court Judge, or any Judge, can assume the duties of the President of the United States. Only Crime and Chaos would result.""Judges are now being openly identified as ""Obama judges"" ""Biden judges"" ""Bush judges"" etc depending on who and in what year they were appointed. Chief Justice John Roberts himself --- a Conservative Republican Bush appointee -- is under attack from MAGA for not consistently ruling in favor of Trump and resisting the move to impeach liberal judges.""If Justice Roberts and the United States Supreme Court do not fix this toxic and unprecedented situation IMMEDIATELY, our Country is in very serious trouble!""

Q: Is it true that US students are falling behind globally?

Q: What impact has the education department had on student performance?

Q: Is the public in favor of closing the department?

Q: Who supports Trump’s move?

Q: What’s next?

Trump, surrounded by schoolchildren seated at desks arranged in the White House's East Room, smiled as he held up the signed order during a special ceremony.Since its founding in 1979, the department of education (DoE) has played a pivotal role in administering student loans, supporting students with disabilities and low-income families, and enforcing civil rights in schools. Trump’s action, framed as a bid to return power to the states, reflects long-standing conservative frustration with what they view as federal overreach in education.While Trump cannot legally abolish the department without Congressional approval, the executive order signals his administration’s intent to cripple it through staff reductions and budget cuts. Backed by tech tycoon Elon Musk’s department for government efficiency (DOGE), the effort has already seen nearly half of the DoE’s workforce laid off. The move has thrilled conservative groups like Moms for Liberty but sparked outrage among educators, civil rights advocates, and Democratic lawmakers who warn that it could undermine protections and funding for millions of vulnerable students.Here is all you need to knowA: The order directs education secretary Linda McMahon to “take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the department of education and return education authority to the states.” While it does not immediately abolish the department—Congress must approve that—it does instruct the administration to scale back operations and staffing.A: Trump argued, “We're going to return education back to the states where it belongs,” calling the federal department unnecessary. He also cited falling test scores and high spending as reasons, saying, “It’s doing us no good.” He believes states can run education systems more efficiently, comparing his goal to countries like “Norway, Denmark, [and] Finland.”A: No. Abolishing a federal agency like the DoE requires an act of Congress. Trump currently lacks the necessary majority to pass such a law. However, he can significantly weaken the department through budget cuts, workforce reductions, and administrative changes.According to White House press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, “The department of education will be much smaller than it is today.” Some “critical functions”—like Pell Grants, student loans, and funding for students with disabilities—are expected to remain. Trump himself said these “useful functions… will be fully preserved.”A: Low-income students, students with disabilities, and students in rural or underfunded districts stand to lose the most. Programs like Title I and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act depend on federal oversight and funding. As Katie Paris of Red Wine and Blue said, “There’s a real opportunity people are going to learn how essential the education department is to access public schools if it’s gone.”A: About 13% of funding for K-12 schools comes from the federal government; the rest is state and locally funded. But that 13% is vital, especially in states that rely heavily on federal dollars—like Mississippi, South Dakota, Montana, and Arkansas.A: Not entirely. Trump claims US students rank “at the bottom of the list,” but data shows otherwise. According to the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), US students are “above average in reading and close to average in math.” Nat Malkus of the conservative American Enterprise Institute added, “The US ranks in the middle of the pack on most international assessments.”A: The department’s critics claim it hasn’t closed achievement gaps. But national data shows that since its founding, fourth-grade math scores have increased by 24 points, and reading scores have held steady. Fernando Reimers of Harvard noted, “In the US only 4 percent of total federal spending is devoted to education,” far less than in many peer countries.A: No. A Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 65% of Americans oppose shuttering the department, with only 30% in support. Democratic pollster John Anzalone argued, “Education is generally popular with voters,” suggesting this could backfire on Trump politically.A: Conservative advocacy groups like Moms for Liberty and the Heritage Foundation strongly back the decision. “It’s a beautiful day to dismantle the Department of Education,” the Heritage Foundation said on X. Moms for Liberty co-founder Tina Descovich added, “I'm very happy about that,” in reference to department cuts.A: Several lawsuits have already been filed. Senator Patty Murray said, “Donald Trump knows perfectly well he can’t abolish the department of education without Congress.” A previous attempt to dismantle the US Agency for International Development was blocked by a federal judge for likely violating the Constitution.While the executive order sets the process in motion, full closure of the department will face Congressional scrutiny, potential legal battles, and continued public debate. As Margaret Spellings, George W Bush’s education secretary, put it: “Donald Trump has called the bluff.” Whether that bluff results in full elimination remains to be seen.(With inputs from agencies)","US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to shut down the department of education.

'They did bad things': Donald Trump orders crackdown on law firms who challenged him,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/they-did-bad-things-donald-trump-orders-crackdown-on-law-firms-who-challenged-him/articleshow/119361813.cms,".





Trump Responds To Claims That His Actions Towards Law Firms Are ‘Coercion’: They ‘Did Bad Things’

US president Donald Trump has ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to review the actions of lawyers and law firms that his administration believes filed frivolous lawsuits or attempted to block immigration policies.In the Friday-night memo first reported by CNN, Trump accused some legal professionals of engaging in ""frivolous, unreasonable, and vexatious litigation"" against the government. The directive asks Bondi to review lawsuits filed in the past eight years and recommend possible actions against attorneys found to have acted improperly. This could include revoking security clearances, cancelling federal contracts, or other penalties.The memo's vague language leaves it unclear what specific actions would warrant punishment. However, it explicitly calls for misconduct complaints against lawyers working on immigration-related cases.Trump has long expressed frustration with legal opposition to his policies, particularly regarding immigration. His administration has faced numerous legal challenges over travel bans, asylum restrictions, and border enforcement measures. This latest move is seen as an attempt to deter further lawsuits.“Far too many attorneys and law firms have long ignored these requirements when litigating against the Federal Government or in pursuing baseless partisan attacks,” Trump said in the presidential memorandum released by the White House on Saturday.During Friday's Oval Office meeting, president Trump responded to questions about his actions towards law firms. ""They went after me for years ruthlessly, violently, illegally. They are not babies. They are very sophisticated people. They did bad things. They went after me for years.""The White House defended the decision in a post on X, saying, ""In everything we do, we're restoring law, restoring order, and restoring public safety in America... and bringing honour, integrity, and accountability back to the highest levels of government.""Trump’s actions against the legal community seem to have led at least one major law firm to make concessions this week. According to New York Post, Paul Weiss, a prominent law firm known for working with Democratic clients, agreed to provide $40 million in pro bono legal services to the Trump administration. This decision was made to bypass an executive order that would have restricted the firm from representing clients before the federal government.","US president Donald Trump has ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to review the actions of lawyers and law firms.

Do foreigners have free speech rights in the United States?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/do-foreigners-have-free-speech-rights-in-the-united-states/articleshow/119360286.cms,"Two Indian scholars are among those targeted by Trump administration for what it calls 'support' for Hamas. In India, foreigners don't enjoy constitutional protection of freedom of speech. But the situation is more complex in America , because of its First Amendment. Here's a short explainer on the legal ambiguity

Ranjini Srinivasan and Badar Khan Suri have been at the receiving end of America’s new deportation policy targeting those seen to be sympathising with the Palestinian group Hamas. The latter is banned as a terrorist organisation by US, and the Trump administration has been clear that foreign scholars in the American university system found supporting Hamas will have their visas revoked and deported. But can merely expressing a political opinion attract deportation proceedings? Does freedom of speech only apply to citizens? What does Indian law say in similar context? Here’s a breakdown of the legal nuances: What’s the Indian legal view?Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India provides for the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression. The article begins with ‘All citizens shall have the right... to freedom of speech and expression’. Therefore, the position in India about applicability of this right is unambiguous and applies only to citizens, not foreigners. What about the US First Amendment? Are foreigners in US with legal visas covered?US Constitution states that ‘Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech’. Moreover, the constitution makers in US spoke about ‘the people’, which could be extended to any person who is validly within the territory of the country, a throwback to America’s founding. Thus, given that the First Amendment essentially is a restriction on Congress, from plain reading it applies even when Congress is making a law governing non-citizens of the country with valid visas. One can also argue that this applies to illegal immigrants. In fact, on this basis, institutions like Columbia University’s Knight First Amendment Institute have called Trump’s deportation of students partaking in political pro-Palestine speeches, as illegal and unconstitutional.What is Trump’s position? However, the current US administration is likely to take the defence of the interplay of US constitution with other existing statutes that regulate the activities of non-citizens. In the past, similar ploys have been used by other presidents to stifle political opposition. These are some examples.Alien Enemies Act 1798 was introduced by president John Adams to restrain political debate, convicting multiple non-citizens, which were later overturned when president Jefferson came to power. During the 1950s at the height of the anti-communism wave in US, Congress passed laws banning the Communist Party and allowing the deportation of noncitizen members. Robert Galvan, a longtime US resident, faced deportation for past Communist Party membership before the laws were enacted. The US Supreme Court upheld his deportation, though Justice Hugo Black dissented, arguing it was unfair to punish Galvan for past actions which were legal.In Reno v. American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, US govt sought to deport eight legal US residents for their involvement in a Palestinian liberation group. The group argued they were being selectively targeted for their political views, but the US govt shifted to immigration law violations instead. The Supreme Court, with Justice Scalia writing the majority opinion, ruled that non-citizens unlawfully in US cannot use selective enforcement as a defence against deportation. However, the question of rights of lawful non-citizens was per se not touched upon.So, there is no clear-cut answer whether the First Amendment protects non-citizens. US Constitution allows for interpretation, particularly regarding undocumented immigrants, and the Supreme Court has yet to make a definitive ruling. Additionally, the First Amendment does not specify whether “the people” entitled to freedoms like speech, religion, and assembly refers strictly to citizens or includes a wider group, such as visitors, students, and workers in the US.","In India, foreigners don't enjoy constitutional protection of freedom of speech. But the situation is more complex in America, because of its First Amendment. Here's a short explainer on the legal ambiguity in the US.

'Revoking parole status to expedite deportation'

WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump's administration will revoke the temporary legal status of 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans in the country, according to a Federal Register notice on Friday, the latest expansion of his crackdown on immigration.The move, effective April 24, cuts short a two-year ""parole"" granted to the migrants under former President Joe Biden that allowed them to enter the country by air if they had US sponsors. Trump, a Republican, took steps to ramp up immigration enforcement after taking office, including a push to deport record numbers of migrants in the US illegally. ReutersHe has argued that the legal entry parole programmes launched under his Democratic predecessor overstepped the boundaries of federal law and called for their termination in a Jan 20 executive order.Trump said on March 6 that he would decide ""very soon"" whether to strip the parole status from some 240,000 Ukrainians who fled to the US during the conflict with Russia. The remarks came in response to a report that said his administration planned to revoke the status for Ukrainians as soon as April.Biden launched a parole entry programme for Venezuelans in 2022 and expanded it to Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans in 2023 as his administration grappled with high levels of illegal immigration from those nationalities. Diplomatic and political relations between the four countries and the US have been strained.The new legal pathways came as Biden tried to clamp down on illegal crossings at the US-Mexico border. The Trump administration's decision to strip the legal status from half a million migrants could make many vulnerable to deportation if they choose to remain in the US. It remains unclear how many who entered the US on parole now have another form of protection.In a notice set to formally publish in the Federal Register on Monday, the US department of homeland security said revoking the parole status would make it easier to place the migrants in a fast-track deportation process called ""expedited removal"".Under a Trump-era policy implemented in Jan, expedited removal can be applied to certain migrants in the US for two years or less.","The move, effective April 24, cuts short a two-year ""parole"" granted to the migrants under former President Joe Biden.

Canada's travel advisory for China



Canada has now updated its travel advisories for the United States and China in the backdrop of the ongoing tariff war with the US and after China executed four Canadians in recent weeks. The update said Canadians who are staying in the United States for more than 30 days should make sure that they are registered. This comes as the Donald Trump administration made the registration mandatory. Earlier, Canadians did not need any visa or registration to travel to the US.“Canadians and other foreign nationals visiting the United States for periods longer than 30 days must be registered with the United States Government,” the latest travel advisory to the United States said. “Failure to comply with the registration requirement could result in penalties, fines, and misdemeanor prosecution.”Visitors can consult the US Citizenship and Immigration Services website to check if they need to register and how to do so, the advisor said. Travelers can see if they have been automatically registered on entry to the US by looking at their I-94 admission form on the US CBP website, the advisory said.Apart from the US, Canada updated its travel advisory to China as well after foreign affairs minister Melanie Joy said earlier this week that China executed four Canadians in recent months. The updated advisory warned Canadians to exercise a ""high degree of caution"" in China -- especially those with dual citizenship who may be denied access to Canadian consular services if they entered the country on a Chinese passport.“Our ability to provide consular assistance in China is limited due to the level of transparency in China’s judicial system,” the advisory said. “It may also impact your ability to obtain effective legal assistance.”The Canadian travel advisory to China also warned that non-violent acts such as financial crimes may incur “severe punishment” in the country. It adds that travellers may also face an exit ban if they are linked to people “in any open civil or criminal investigations, including business disputes.”","Canada has updated its travel advisories for the US and China.

His day in court refers to his lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's executive orders to ""combat anti-semitism"" on college campuses. “He lives in constant fear that he may be arrested by immigration officials or police as a result of his speech,” Taal’s attorneys said in the lawsuit that they think might have attracted the latest plan to deport him.On October 7, 2023, immediately after the Hamas attack on Israel, Taal posted, “Colonised peoples have the right to resist by any means necessary” and “Glory to the resistance!” drawing massive flak.","Momodou Taal, a dual citizen of the UK and the Gambia, has been asked to surrender to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, by the Department of Justice, according to a court filing.

Arbaiza had been ordering Happy Meals for his two grandchildren when a gunfight erupted between two groups of men, leading to chaos inside the restaurant, which was filled with customers and children.His wife, Teresa, who had been married to him for nearly 40 years, witnessed the harrowing events unfold while waiting outside in the car with their grandchildren. Speaking to KHOU 11, she recalled the terrifying moments.""I couldn't leave the kids alone. I could not go inside,"" Teresa said. ""The kids were crying, and they were scared.""Just seconds before the shooting began, Teresa noticed a man with a gun in her vehicle's rearview mirror. When she did not see her husband running out with the other customers, she called his cellphone. The last words she heard from him were chilling: ""I'm dying. I'm going to die.""Arbaiza was airlifted to a hospital but later succumbed to his injuries.
