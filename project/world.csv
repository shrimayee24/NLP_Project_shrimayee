NEW DELHI: Sonam Raghuvanshi's father has claimed her innocence after she was arrested by the UP Police on Monday for allegedly hiring people to kill her husband during their honeymoon in Meghalaya. He accused the Meghalaya Police was ""lying"" after they claimed that she ""hired"" assailants to kill her spouse.""My daughter is innocent. I have trust in my daughter. She cannot do this (kill her husband)... They got married with the consent of both families.

Pak Attacked India' | Watch

NEW DELHI: The multi-party parliamentary delegation led by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on late Sunday concluded its high-level visit to the United States, wrapping up the final leg of a diplomatic mission aimed at building international consensus on India’s counter-terrorism stance following the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, which left 26 people dead.Taking to X as he wrapped up the US visit, Tharoor wrote: “If you are born a hundred times, you will do it a hundred times. I will love my country with all my heart… A Watan. The whole world now knows the truth. We are lovers of non-violence, but only until someone tests that... Jai Hind!”On the final day of the tour, the delegation paid tribute to Mahatma Gandhi’s statue in Washington. Tharoor later posted on X: “It is striking how many world capitals are adorned with statues or busts of the Mahatma, the 20th century’s greatest apostle of peace, nonviolence, and human freedom.”The group, which arrived in Washington on June 3 after stops in Guyana, Panama, Colombia, and Brazil, met with several key American leaders including US Vice President JD Vance, Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau, senior members of Congress, policy experts, and members of the Indian-American community.Describing the meeting with Vance as “an excellent meeting,” Tharoor said the Vice President was “warm and welcoming and receptive,” and “expressed complete understanding, first of all, outrage of what happened in Pahalgam and support and respect for India’s restrained response in Operation Sindoor.”A US State Department spokesperson said Landau “reaffirmed the United States’ strong support of India in the fight against terrorism and the strategic partnership between the two countries.”Addressing the Centre on Foreign Relations, Tharoor had said India’s actions were targeted at terror infrastructure, not civilians. “We're not interested in attacking Pakistani civilians, ordinary people. This is about India versus terrorism… If you're not prepared to shut down the safe havens or arrest terrorist leaders, then I'm afraid this is the only way we can deal with it,” he said.Referring to Pakistan’s military, he added, “In India, the state has an army. In Pakistan, the army has a state,” accusing Islamabad of manipulating public opinion through conflict. Tharoor dismissed claims of Pakistani success during the brief hostilities that followed, saying, “Two videos came out on social media, both turned out to be from other conflicts in other years, nothing to do with this one.”","Congress MP Shashi Tharoor wraps up high-level visit to the United States.

BENGALURU: Cops at Suryanagar station in Bengaluru Urban district were shocked when a young man entered their premises on a gearless scooter, with a severed head placed near his legs, in the wee hours of Saturday.Three police constables and an assistant sub-inspector, who were on night patrol, were standing outside the police station. They were scheduled to patrol in different directions and were getting ready to leave when the man stopped his vehicle near the station compound.A cop said: ""We asked who he was and what had brought him to the station.

Residing at Heelalige, Shankar works as an assistant manager with a battery-manufacturing unit in Bommanahalli, while Manasa, also 26, worked in a factory on the same premises.According to police, she had an affair with a colleague — now elusive — and this ended in the killing.The couple's three-year-old daughter lives with Manasa's parents at Hebbugodi.

India's balancing act

What's the road ahead?

As US President Donald Trump publicly lashes out at Vladimir Putin for dragging out the Ukraine war, Moscow is quietly retooling its Asia strategy putting India front and centre in hopes of countering growing Western influence. While Trump’s frustration with Putin mounts, the Kremlin has ramped up arms deals and diplomatic outreach to New Delhi, aiming to revive the once-promising Russia-India-China (RIC) troika as a foil to the Quad.Trump’s irritation with Putin has grown as the Kremlin delays a ceasefire. While Kyiv reportedly accepted Trump's earlier 30-day truce proposal, Russia refused, insisting on terms that would force Ukraine to surrender territory not even under Russian control. Trump has since offered to host peace talks, but Moscow’s demands, including US recognition of Crimea, have drawn accusations from experts like former ambassador Michael McFaul, who called them “poison pills” meant to derail diplomacy.This has forced Putin to rekindle old alliances as a means to ‘fight, fight, fight’ against the US influence. From arms deals to trilateral summits, Russia is intensifying efforts to woo New Delhi, hoping to revive the Russia-India-China (RIC) dialogue as a counterweight to Western influence.The situation became more tricky for New Delhi when US secretary of commerce Howard Lutnick delivered a forthright assessment of recent tensions in the India-US relationship, pointing to certain Indian policies that “rubbed the US the wrong way.” These include New Delhi’s continued purchase of military equipment from Russia and its participation in the BRICS grouping, which Lutnick characterised as an attempt to “not support the dollar and dollar hegemony. ”“That’s not really the way to make friends and influence people in America,” Lutnick said, noting that President Trump “calls that out directly,” and the Indian government is now “addressing it specifically.”Despite such differences, Lutnick struck an optimistic tone, calling India’s economy “extraordinary” and praising its “amazing” human capital and growth. He said both countries are working towards a trade agreement and that “you should expect a deal...in the not too distant future.”Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, speaking in Perm on Friday, revealed new efforts to woo India. He claimed Moscow was told India joined the Quad alliance, which includes the US, Australia and Japan, purely for economic cooperation. But Lavrov warned that the alliance is being militarised behind the scenes.“In practice, other countries from the Quad are already trying, already insisting on organising naval and other military exercises,” Lavrov said. “And I’m sure that our Indian friends can see this provocation clearly,” he said.Also read: 'US, other Quad countries trying to force India into military alliance rather than just trade,' claims Russia Lavrov’s remarks came a day before US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth’s announcement that the US is deepening its military relationship with India. Hegseth cited joint exercises like Tiger Triumph and Towson Sabre as evidence of growing strategic coordination in the Indo-Pacific. He also pointed to the Indo-Pacific Logistics Network and the PIPER initiative as efforts to integrate the region’s defence infrastructure.“Rookies talk strategy, pros talk logistics,” Hegseth said, signalling the US goal of building a sustained and interconnected defence presence in Asia. He emphasised that Trump’s foreign policy was “grounded in common sense and national interest” and stressed that a resilient alliance of like-minded democracies remains America’s greatest strength against Chinese ambitions.But for Russia, these moves are part of what Lavrov describes as a Western ploy to “divide and conquer,” a phrase he says President Putin himself recently used. Lavrov warned that the rebranding of the Asia-Pacific into the “Indo-Pacific” was designed to isolate China and undermine ASEAN.Perhaps the most significant signal from Lavrov was Russia’s renewed push for the revival of the Russia-India-China (RIC) trilateral dialogue. The forum, originally proposed by former Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, has met over 20 times and served as a platform for cooperation in trade, finance, and foreign policy.“Now that… an understanding has been reached between India and China on how to calm the situation on the border, it seems to me that the time has come to revive this RIC troika,” Lavrov said. He framed the grouping as a valuable mechanism that could balance out the influence of Western-led coalitions like the Quad.However, India’s position remains complex. For years, India has enjoyed a privileged status as one of Russia’s largest arms importers. Moscow provided India with cutting-edge weaponry, sometimes even before it was deployed in the Russian military itself.From India’s strategic viewpoint, the RIC format carries other risks. Beijing continues to occupy a key position in South Asia’s strategic balance, primarily through its deepening alliance with Islamabad. India remains concerned that any trilateral cooperation would be undermined unless China reconsiders its longstanding military and nuclear support for Pakistan.Moreover, the RIC format’s perceived anti-American leanings are another sticking point. With Indo-US relations having deepened under both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Trump, especially on defence and technology cooperation, New Delhi may find it increasingly difficult to align with Russia and China in ways that could appear contrary to its current trajectory.Professor Rajan Kumar, from the School of International Studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University while speaking with the, said that Russia’s push for a revived RIC format may be “wishful thinking by Russia, and it flies away in context of the real world and the current geo-political landscape.”He agreed, however, with Foreign Minister Lavrov’s warning that the West seeks to “divide and conquer” the India–China relationship.On whether the RIC would serve as a platform for direct mediation with China, Professor Kumar noted that “though India and China are members of several international organisations, like the BRICS and SCO, a direct mediation with China is not possible. Particularly after the Ladakh incident in 2020, after which New Delhi’s trust with Beijing has disappeared.”Asked whether India must align with either the US or Russia, he warned that “given the current policies of the Trump administration, India cannot depend on the United States. As a consequence of the US president’s policy the world has moved towards protectionism, and in the context of defence production this has ruled out the possibility of joint production of weapons.”He further noted India’s longstanding tradition of strategic autonomy, adding, “India has always maintained the policy of strategic autonomy, and it doesn’t have the policy of involving other countries in its policy of China, and India sees China as a rival country. I believe in the coming time the tensions between New Delhi and Beijing are likely to escalate.”On whether Russia taking military equipment from China during its war with Ukraine would have impact on India’s defence dealings with Russia, Professor Kumar observed: “Yes, we do have a certain degree of dependence on Russian defence equipment, as was recently seen in the India-Pakistan war, with the successful use of S-400 on the defensive front and the BrahMos missile on the offensive. But yes, we are also trying to diversify our defence, with deals from Israel and France. ”Professor Rajan welcomed India’s efforts to boost indigenous defence production, noting that “one good thing is that India has also ramped up its own defence production and is moving towards becoming a major defence exporter; however, when compared to other countries its defence dealings are still minuscule.”Speaking on how India’s close ties with Russia can be leveraged to question China’s support for Pakistan, he explained that “India has repeatedly voiced concerns about both China and Pakistan, especially regarding Islamabad’s support for terrorist groups. Yet, India cannot dictate Russian foreign policy, as Moscow is grappling with its own geopolitical constraints. Since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia has faced isolation and sanctions from the West, compelling it to deepen ties elsewhere. India, while strengthening ties with Western democracies, notably refrained from imposing sanctions on Russia and has abstained from UN resolutions condemning Moscow. This stance reflects India’s effort to balance relations rather than fully aligning with Western positions. Concurrently, India participates in the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) alongside the US, Australia, and Japan, a grouping often viewed as a strategic counterweight to China’s influence.”India is poised to maintain its careful balancing act. In practice, New Delhi will likely deepen its defence ties with the US expanding logistics cooperation and joint exercises while continuing to source critical systems from Russia wherever gaps remain in its domestic industry.At the same time, India’s focus on ramping up indigenous production and forging new partnerships with France and Israel suggests that Moscow’s overtures, though acknowledged, will be weighed against broader economic and strategic interests. Whatever shape RIC might take, New Delhi’s core priority will remain safeguarding its own strategic autonomy managing great-power competition without becoming dependent on any single capital.","Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov revealed new efforts to woo India. He claimed Moscow was told India joined the Quad alliance, which includes the US, Australia and Japan, purely for economic cooperation.

'DAPR secretary gave permission for Vidhan Soudha event': Siddaramaiah

NEW DELHI: Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah on Sunday defended the decision to go ahead with the event to felicitate the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) players, despite a stampede outside the team's home ground, the Chinnaswamy Stadium.On Wednesday, a ceremony was held at the Karnataka Vidhan Soudha to felicitate RCB on clinching the Indian Premier League (IPL) title, the franchise's first since the league began in April 2008. A celebration was also held at the nearby Chinnaswamy Stadium, where a large number of fans thronged.This led to a stampede outside the ground, in which 11 people died and 56 were injured.""Actually at 3:50 pm, deaths were reported at the hospital. I got to know only at 5:45 pm. Until then, I did not know about the stampede and deaths,"" news agency PTI quoted Siddaramaiah as saying. He was speaking to reporters during a visit to Mysuru.The chief minister also clarified that the ceremony at the Vidhana Soudha was by the Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA), and that he attended the programme only as an invitee.""The KSCA secretary and treasurer met and invited me. It was not organised by us (state government).They (KSCA) had, and I was invited. They told me that the governor would also come. So, I had gone. Other than that, I don't know anything. The government has nothing to do...I was not invited to the stadium event,"" the Congress leader said.""Nothing untoward happened at the Vidhana Soudha. The stampede incident happened at the stadium later,"" he added.Siddaramaiah's remarks come even as a letter by DCP (Vidhana Soudha security) to the secretary to the Karnataka government's Department of Personnel and Administrative Reforms (DPAR), surfaced . The letter warned against organising the function hastily, and highlighted that the force did not have an adequate number of personnel to provide security for a ceremony where a large number of people would gather, at short notice.This in response to the DPAR seeking the DCP's opinion on holding the felicitation event on the grand stairs of the Vidhana Soudha to honour the RCB players.""RCB has a fan following across the country. Organising the event in a hurry on the grand stairs of Vidhana Soudha will lead to lakhs of cricket fans arriving there. This will lead to problems in 'bandobast' (arrangement) since there is a shortage of officers/personnel,"" the DCP's letter read.The officer further said if the function is organised, passes for visitors to Vidhana Soudha should be completely stopped.Also, as there were chances of the secretariat staff getting their family members for the event, he suggested an order aimed at ensuring this doesn't happen. The officer also sought a holiday in the afternoon for secretariat staff to ensure that they too don't come there.The DCP also called for installation of more CCTV cameras in the vicinity of Vidhana Soudha - which is a vital installation - and nearby places in view of the large gatherings expected.Siddaramaiah was asked by reporters about the letter.He replied, ""What does the letter say? The police will act according to what the government decides. It did not come to me at all. DAPR secretary has given the permission. Of course I was told. I said give permission to the event in front of Vidhana Soudha.""","Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah defends decision to go ahead with event.

NEW DELHI: Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and other leaders of the principal opposition party on Sunday targeted the BJP-led central government, particularly Prime Minister Narendra Modi , as fresh violence erupted in Manipur , this time over the arrest of a key leader of the Meitei community.Gandhi alleged that PM Modi has ""abdicated"" his responsibility towards the state.""Manipur is once again in the grip of violence. For nearly two years, the people of the state have been facing violence, murder, and rape, which has forced them to migrate. Hundreds have died, thousands of people are homeless. What is the reason that despite President's rule, peace is not being restored there?"" The Wayanad MP wrote on X, referring to the ethnic conflict between the Meitei and Kuki communities.Further, she took on the prime minister for not visiting Manipur since the ethnic conflict began in May 2023.""He has not met any representative of the state, nor appealed for peace, nor made any concrete effort. This insensitive and irresponsible attitude is extremely unfortunate for any democracy. It is the prime minister's responsibility to ensure peace and security for the citizens of the country. To step back from this is to turn away from one's duty,"" Gandhi added.Jairam Ramesh, the grand old party's communications in-charge who has repeatedly criticized the PM on the Manipur issue, wrote a long social media post to slam him again.""Pain, distress, and agony of the people of Manipur continues unabated as five districts have been rocked by violence in the last 24 hours. In the February 2022 assembly election, the BJP won a majority on its own. However, a mere 15 months after that mandate, Manipur was left to burn from the night of 3 May 2023. Hundreds of innocent men, women and children were murdered,"" Ramesh said.""The Union home minister made a token visit to Manipur , the prime minister has neither said anything nor met anyone till now...despite the imposition of President's rule, there was no difference on the ground. Even the governor had to travel from Imphal airport to his residence by helicopter . Law and order is still in shambles,"" he further stated.Meanwhile, after a night of violence, the situation remained tense in Manipur on Sunday with the administration imposing prohibitory orders and suspending internet services in five Imphal valley districts. The prohibitory orders have been clamped in Imphal West, Imphal East, Thoubal, Bishnupur, and Kakching districts, while internet and mobile data services have also been suspended in these areas.","Gandhi alleged that PM Modi has ""abdicated"" his responsibility towards the state.

Sonam held for killing husband, What we know so far in Meghalaya murder case",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/meghalaya-honeymoon-murder-mystery-rajas-wife-sonam-3-others-held-after-17-days-what-we-know-so-far/articleshow/121716563.cms,"Here's a detailed breakdown of what has unfolded so far:

Body found in gorge

Raja was killed using machete

The twist: Wife hired killers

Meghalaya govt deployed drones

CCTV footage shows couple checking out of a hotel

Conrad K Sangma praises Meghalaya police





NEW DELHI: The police got a major breakthrough in the murder of Indore resident Raja Raghuvanshi during his honeymoon in Meghalaya after arresting his wife, Sonam, along with three other accused. According to police, Sonam allegedly orchestrated the killing with the help of hired assailants. The arrests were made following intensive investigations, and the case continues to unfold.Teams from the Meghalaya and Indore police are expected to reach Ghazipur today to continue the investigation. Police will escort Sonam to Meghalaya to recreate the crime scene where Raja Raghuvanshi was found dead.The arrest was made with coordination between local and Meghalaya police, involving three state police forces in the investigation.Devi Singh, the father of Sonam, strongly denied the allegations against his daughter and accused the Meghalaya police of fabricating the case.""My daughter is innocent. I have trust in my daughter. She cannot do this (kill her husband). They got married with the consent of both families. The state (Meghalaya) government has been lying from the beginning. My daughter came to a dhaba in Ghazipur last night and she called her brother. Police went to the dhaba, and she was taken from there,"" Sonam Raghuvanshi's father, Devi Singh said,""I have not been able to speak to my daughter.Why will my daughter do such a thing (kill her husband)? The Meghalaya Police is lying. My daughter reached Ghazipur on her own. She was not arrested in Meghalaya. We were thinking of meeting Madhya Pradesh CM and then Union HM Amit Shah to request a CBI inquiry. Meghalaya Police is making up stories. Let the CBI inquiry begin, all officers at the police station (in Meghalaya) will be behind bars. "" Singh added.Raja and Sonam Raghuvanshi, newlyweds from Indore, arrived in Meghalaya for their honeymoon in May. On May 22, the couple reached Mawlakhiyat village and undertook the steep 3,000-step trek to Nongriat, known for its iconic living root bridges. They spent the night in a homestay and were last seen checking out the next morning.Their rented scooter was later found abandoned on May 24 near a cafe along the Shillong–Sohra road. After days of no contact, Raja was reported missing.On June 4, Raja’s decomposed body was found inside a deep gorge near Weisawdong Falls. His identity was confirmed by a tattoo on his hand—“Raja and a lady”—and a waterproof smartwatch he had borrowed from his brother. Missing items included his wallet, four mobile phones, and gold jewellery.Police recovered a raincoat believed to belong to the couple in nearby Mawkma village and later found one of Raja’s mobile phones.A 'dao' (machete) believed to be the murder weapon was recovered by the East Khasi Hills police. SP Vivek Syiem confirmed that the machete was newly purchased and used solely for the crime. A case of murder and destruction of evidence was registered, and the police indicated that the probe was being treated as a top priority.The post-mortem report is awaited to determine if Raja was killed before or after falling into the gorge.On June 9, Meghalaya director general of police I Nongrang revealed a chilling development, Raja’s wife, Sonam, had hired the assailants. She surrendered to police at Nandganj Police Station in Ghazipur, Uttar Pradesh.Three more suspects, all men, were arrested in overnight raids—two from Indore and one from UP. The accused reportedly confessed to the murder-for-hire plot during interrogation.The Meghalaya government deployed drones to assist in the ongoing search operation carried out by the National Disaster Response Force, State Disaster Response Force, SRT, Fire and Emergency Services, Special Operations Team, Special Investigation Team, and local volunteers on June 6 (Friday). The operation was conducted in inclement weather and challenging terrain in an effort to locate the missing woman from Indore.The search was called off in the evening due to foggy weather and poor visibility and was scheduled to resume on Saturday.CCTV footage emerged showing an Indore couple checking out of a hotel in Meghalaya shortly before their mysterious disappearance last month. The video, captured on the evening of May 22, was the last confirmed sighting of Raja Raghuvanshi and his wife Sonam before they travelled to Sohra (Cherrapunjee), where Raja’s body was later found in a deep gorge.The newlyweds reportedly left their luggage at a hotel in Sohra and proceeded towards Maulakaya village. They were not seen again.Raja’s decomposed body was found at Weisawdong Falls.Police say the operation to apprehend all involved is ongoing, with further arrests likely. Chief minister Conrad K Sangma praised the Meghalaya police for cracking the case and called the breakthrough significant.","Raja and Sonam Raghuvanshi, newlyweds from Indore, arrived in Meghalaya for their honeymoon in May.

Despite warm public rhetoric, a confidential document from Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) reveals deep suspicion of China, labelling it a serious espionage threat to Russian national security and sees it as “the enemy. ”As per a report by The New York Times, an undisclosed FSB intelligence unit has warned of increased Chinese efforts to spy on Russia’s military, steal sensitive technology, and recruit Russian experts, even as Moscow publicly hails its partnership with Beijing as a “strategic alliance.”The FSB’s internal eight-page memo, reviewed and verified by six Western intelligence agencies, outlines how China is allegedly targeting Russian scientists, military operations in Ukraine, and Arctic development through covert means.It was reportedly authored in late 2023 or early 2024 and obtained by the hacker group Ares Leaks. Although the precise origin remains unclear, experts cited by The New York Times believe the document appears authentic and sheds rare light on Russia’s counterespionage strategy toward an ostensible ally.“China is the enemy,” intelligence officers from the FSB’s 7th Service, a unit focused on Asian espionage, state in the memo, which sharply contrasts with the public narrative of Russia-China unity.According to the document, the FSB launched a new counterintelligence program codenamedjust days before Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, aiming to block Chinese infiltration while avoiding diplomatic fallout.The memo warns officers not to publicly refer to China as a threat, showing the tightrope Russia walks in managing its dependency on Beijing.The FSB claims China has sought to exploit Russia’s wartime focus to recruit disillusioned military experts, particularly those working on now-defunct projects like the Soviet-era. “Priority recruitment is given to former employees…experiencing financial difficulties,” the memo reportedly says.As per the report, Chinese intelligence has targeted Russians with Chinese spouses, used WeChat for surveillance, and deployed scientists and businesspeople to gather intelligence under the guise of academic or commercial cooperation.Though Russia depends on China for oil exports, technology, and sanctions-busting trade, the document says Beijing may be eyeing long-term strategic gains, including territorial claims in the Russian Far East.The FSB accuses Chinese researchers of promoting historical ties to areas like Vladivostok, publishing maps with ancient Chinese names, and searching for ""ancient Chinese peoples"" in Russian territory.The memo also warns of Beijing’s growing soft-power strategy in Central Asia and spying activities in the Arctic. It claims Chinese firms and universities are being used as covers to study Russia’s Arctic projects and influence local policy.Still, the FSB advises caution: any moves against China require high-level clearance to avoid damaging bilateral relations. “Jeopardising the support of China would be worse,” the memo concludes.The document also reveals that Russia is not merely defending itself from Chinese espionage but is attempting to influence it. The FSB states that Russian counterintelligence has been instructed to deliberately feed China’s agents with positive information about Russian operations in Ukraine.This suggests a strategic effort by Moscow to manage Beijing’s internal assessment of the war, especially as China closely watches Russia's performance against Western weapons. The goal appears to be to reassure China of Russia’s strength and maintain its support, despite private fears of Chinese exploitation.According to Carnegie analyst Alexander Gabuev, as cited by the New York Times, “Putin believes that he can go much deeper into this Chinese embrace, and it’s not risk-free, but it is worth it,” suggesting that Moscow sees the benefits of the relationship outweighing its espionage concerns.","A confidential document from Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) reveals deep suspicion of China.

'Los Angeles will be set free'





US President Donald Trump on Sunday talked about his decision to deploy National Guard troops to Los Angeles in response to protests against immigration raids, framing the move as essential to restoring law and order.Speaking to reporters before boarding Air Force One, departing for Camp David, Trump claimeddemonstrators had engaged in physical provocation, justifying a tough federal response.“They spit and worse, you know, what they throw at them, right?” Trump said. “And when that happens, I have a little statement. They spit, we hit. And I told them, nobody's going to spit on our police officers, nobody's going to spit on our military. Which they do, is a common thing. They get up to them this far away and then they start spitting in their face. That happens. They get hit very hard.”“I mean, if we see danger to our country and to our citizens, it will be very, very strong in terms of law and order,” he continued, adding, “It's about law and order. We're going to be watching it very closely.""After his statement to reporters, Trump took to his social media platform to announce further action against the anti-immigration protests, calling it an ""invasion"" multiple times.""A once great American City, Los Angeles, has been invaded and occupied by Illegal Aliens and Criminals. Now violent, insurrectionist mobs are swarming and attacking our Federal Agents to try and stop our deportation operations — But these lawless riots only strengthen our resolve,"" he said.Announcing his next steps, he added, ""I am directing Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem , Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth , and Attorney General Pam Bondi, in coordination with all other relevant Departments and Agencies, to take all such action necessary to liberate Los Angeles from the Migrant Invasion, and put an end to these Migrant riots. Order will be restored, the Illegals will be expelled, and Los Angeles will be set free. Thank you for your attention to this matter!""Trump’s comments came soon after troops deployed to a Los Angeles detention center used tear gas to disperse a group of demonstrators protesting the latest wave of raids by US immigration agents. The protests, now in their second day, have sparked tensions across the city and drawn condemnation from state leaders.California Governor Gavin Newsom slammed the troop deployment, calling it an attempt to “manufacture a crisis.” However, the White House said the move was legally justified under Title 10, a seldom-used provision allowing the president to federalize the National Guard during instances of rebellion or threats to federal authority.While Trump has not yet invoked the US Insurrection Act, which would expand his authority to deploy active-duty military forces for domestic law enforcement, he signaled openness to further action. “We’re looking at troops everywhere. We’re not going to let this happen to our country,” he said. When asked what threshold would lead him to send in the Marines instead of Guardsmen, he replied: “The bar is what I think it is. ”","'They spit and worse, you know, what they throw at them, right?’ Trump said.

AMRITSAR: The World Sikh Organization (WSO) of Canada has criticised Canadian PM Mark Carney strongly for inviting Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, to the upcoming G7 Summit in Kananaskis, Alberta, calling the move a betrayal of Canadian values and Sikh concerns.In a statement released on Friday, WSO legal counsel Balpreet Singh said the announcement of Modi's invitation had sparked ""outrage and pain"" within the Canadian Sikh community , while the organisation had written formally to Carney on May 21, urging him not to extend the invitation to the Indian leader.WSO president Danish Singh called the move ""shameful and dangerous,"" accusing the Canadian govt of disregarding Sikh voices amid tensions over the assassination of Canadian Sikh Hardeep Singh Nijjar. India has denied involvement in Nijjar's killing consistently and refused reportedly to cooperate with Canadian authorities investigating the case. The controversy has strained diplomatic ties between the two countries and drawn criticism from Sikh diaspora groups globally.The G7 Summit is set to take place later this year, and Modi's attendance — if confirmed — would mark a high-profile appearance amid ongoing political friction.","The World Sikh Organization (WSO) of Canada has criticised Canadian PM Mark Carney strongly for inviting Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, to the upcoming G7 Summit.

The federal government took over the California national guard and deployed 2,000 soldiers.The move came after US President Donald Trump criticised California officials including governor Gavin Newsom and threatened federal action.ICE reported 118 arrests as part of operations that began Friday, including at a warehouse in the downtown fashion district. Authorities allege the employer used false documents for some workers. Demonstrators have accused ICE and other agencies of using excessive force and say their actions have sparked fear in immigrant communities.Trump ordered 2,000 National Guardsmen to be deployed to Los Angeles, according to his spokeswoman, as clashes with federal agents continued for a second night amid protests over immigration raids.""President Trump has signed a Presidential Memorandum deploying 2,000 national guardsmen to address the lawlessness that has been allowed to fester,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.California governor Gavin Newsom condemned the federal government’s move to take control of the California national guard and deploy 2,000 troops to Los Angeles.He said that the move was ""purposefully inflammatory and will only escalate tensions"".""The federal government is moving to take over the California national guard and deploy 2,000 soldiers. That move is purposefully inflammatory and will only escalate tensions. LA authorities are able to access law enforcement assistance at a moment’s notice. We are in close coordination with the city and county, and there is currently no unmet need. The guard has been admirably serving LA throughout recovery. This is the wrong mission and will erode public trust,"" he said in a post on X.Trump strongly criticised California governor Newsom and LA mayor Karen Bass over the protests.“If governor Gavin Newscum, of California, and Mayor Karen Bass, of Los Angeles, can’t do their jobs… the federal government will step in and solve the problem, RIOTS & LOOTERS, the way it should be solved!!!” Trump wrote.His statement came as federal officials including ICE acting director Todd Lyons and Trump border security adviser Tom Homan defended the enforcement efforts and announced plans to bring in National Guard forces. Homan claimed the move was necessary for public safety, saying, “We are making Los Angeles safer. Mayor Bass should be thanking us.”More than 20 people were also arrested in Lower Manhattan on Saturday after a crowd of nearly 150 protesters clashed with police and attempted to stop federal immigration raids.Protesters dragged metal barricades, traffic cones, and even pulled a dresser without drawers from a nearby dumpster, tossing them into the street to block a van. However, police swiftly cleared the obstacles.","US President Donald Trump ordered 2,000 National Guardsmen to be deployed to Los Angeles.

Significance of Eid al-Adha





As Muslims across the United Arab Emirates prepare to celebrate Eid al-Adha, one of the most important festivals in the Islamic calendar, the General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments has officially announced the prayer timings for cities and regions across the country.

To help worshippers plan accordingly, here is a comprehensive list of prayer times according to Gulf News in each emirate and region for this auspicious occasion.Eid al-Adha, or the “Festival of Sacrifice,” commemorates the willingness of Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) to sacrifice his son in obedience to God. It marks the end of the Hajj pilgrimage in Mecca and is celebrated with special prayers, family gatherings, charity, and the ritual sacrifice of animals. The meat is shared with family, friends, and those in need. The festival serves as a reminder of faith, selflessness, and devotion to God's command.","Eid al-Adha, or the “Festival of Sacrifice,” commemorates the willingness of Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) to sacrifice his son in obedience to God.

"Under Patel, FBI heightens focus on violent crime, illegal immigration. Other threats abound, too",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/under-patel-fbi-heightens-focus-on-violent-crime-illegal-immigration-other-threats-abound-too/articleshow/121717720.cms,"AI- Generated Image





WASHINGTON: When the FBI arrested an accused leader of the MS-13 gang, Kash Patel was there to announce the case, trumpeting it as a step toward returning ""our communities to safety.""Weeks later, when the Justice Department announced the seizure of $510 million in illegal narcotics bound for the US, the FBI director joined other law enforcement leaders in front of a Coast Guard ship in Florida and stacks of intercepted drugs to highlight the haul.His presence was meant to signal the premium the FBI is placing on combating violent crime, drug trafficking and illegal immigration, concerns that have leapfrogged up the agenda in what current and former law enforcement officials say amounts to a rethinking of priorities and mission at a time when the country is also confronting increasingly sophisticated national security threats from abroad.A revised FBI priority list on its website places ""Crush Violent Crime"" at the top, bringing the bureau into alignment with the vision of President Donald Trump, who has made a crackdown on illegal immigration, cartels and transnational gangs a cornerstone of his administration. Patel has said he wants to ""get back to the basics."" His deputy, Dan Bongino, says the FBI is returning to ""its roots.""Patel says the FBI remains focused on some of the same concerns, including China, that have dominated headlines in recent years, and the bureau said in a statement that its commitment to investigating international and domestic terrorism has not changed. That intensifying threat was laid bare over the past month by a spate of violent acts, most recently a Molotov cocktail attack on a Colorado crowd by an Egyptian man who authorities say overstayed his visa and yelled ""Free Palestine.""The FBI continuously analyses the threat landscape and allocates resources and personnel in alignment with that analysis and the investigative needs of the Bureau,"" the FBI said in a statement. ""We make adjustments and changes based on many factors and remain flexible as various needs arise.""Signs of restructuring abound. The Justice Department has disbanded an FBI-led task force on foreign influence and the bureau has moved to dissolve a key public corruption squad in its Washington field office, people familiar with the matter have told The Associated Press. The Trump administration, meanwhile, has proposed steep budget cuts for the FBI, and there's been significant turnover in leadership ranks as some veteran agents with years of experience have been pushed from their positions.Some former officials are concerned the stepped-up focus on violent crime and immigration - areas already core to the mission of agencies including the Drug Enforcement Administration and Immigration and Customs Enforcement - risks deflecting attention from some of the complicated criminal and national security threats for which the bureau has long borne primary if not exclusive responsibility for investigating.""If you're looking down five feet in front of you, looking for gang members and I would say lower-level criminals, you're going to miss some of the more sophisticated strategic issues that may be already present or emerging,"" said Chris Piehota, who retired from the FBI in 2020 as an executive assistant director.A greater focus on immigration Enforcement of immigration laws has long been the principal jurisdiction of immigration agents tasked with arresting people in the US illegally along with border agents who police points of entry.Since Trump's inauguration, the FBI has assumed greater responsibility for that work, saying it's made over 10,000 immigration-related arrests. Patel has highlighted the arrests on social media, doubling down on the administration's promise to prioritize immigration enforcement.Agents have been dispatched to visit migrant children who crossed the US-Mexico border without parents in what officials say is an effort to ensure their safety. Field offices have been directed to commit manpower to immigration enforcement.The Justice Department has instructed the FBI to review files for information about those illegally in the US and provide it to the Department of Homeland Security unless doing so would compromise an investigation. And photos on the FBI's Instagram account depict agents with covered faces and tactical gear alongside detained subjects, with a caption saying the FBI is ""ramping up"" efforts with immigration agents to locate ""dangerous criminals. """"We're giving you about five minutes to cooperate,"" Bongino said on Fox News about illegal immigrants. ""If you're here illegally, five minutes, you're out.""That's a rhetorical shift from prior leadership. Though Patel's direct predecessor, Christopher Wray, warned about the flow of fentanyl through the southern border and the possibility migrants determined to commit terrorism could illegally cross through, he did not characterize immigration enforcement as core to the FBI's mission.A mandate to 'crush violent crime' There's precedent for the FBI to rearrange priorities to meet evolving threats, though for the past two decades countering terrorism has remained a constant atop the agenda.Then-Director Robert Mueller transformed the FBI after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks into a national security, intelligence-gathering agency. Agents were reassigned from investigations into drugs, violent crime and white-collar fraud to fight terrorism. In a top 10 priority list from 2002, protecting the US from terrorism was first. Fighting violent crime was near the bottom, above only supporting law enforcement partners and technology upgrades.The FBI's new list of priorities places ""Crush Violent Crime"" as a top pillar alongside ""Defend the Homeland,"" though FBI leaders have also sought to stress that counterterrorism remains the bureau's principal mandate.Wray often said he was hard-pressed to think of a time when the FBI was facing so many elevated threats at once. At the time of his departure last January, the FBI was grappling with elevated terrorism concerns; Iranian assassination plots on US soil; Chinese spying and hacking of Americans' cell phones; ransomware attacks against hospitals; and Russian influence operations aimed at sowing disinformation.Testifying before lawmakers last month, Patel took care to note the surge in terrorism threats following the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Hamas and a Chinese espionage threat he said had yielded investigations in each of the bureau's offices. But the accomplishments he dwelled on first concerned efforts to ""take dangerous criminals off our streets,"" including the arrests of three suspects on the ""Ten Most Wanted"" list, and large drug seizures.Rounding out the priority list are two newcomers: ""Rebuild Public Trust"" and ""Fierce Organizational Accountability.""Those reflect claims amplified by Patel and Bongino that the bureau had become politicized through its years of investigations of Trump, whose Mar-a-Lago home was searched by agents for classified documents in 2022. Close allies of Trump, both men have committed to disclose files from past investigations, including into Russian election interference and the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol, that have fuelled grievances against the bureau.They've also pledged to examine matters that have captivated attention in conservative circles, like the leak of a draft Supreme Court opinion that overturned Roe v. Wade. Employees have spent hours poring over documents from the sex trafficking case against financier Jeffrey Epstein, a favourite subject of conspiracy theorists, to prepare them for release.Patel had forecast his interest in rejiggering priorities long before becoming director, including by saying that if he ran the bureau, he would ""let good cops be good cops"" and push agents into the field. A critic as a House Republican staffer of the FBI's Trump-Russia investigation, which he calls an example of politicized law enforcement, he had said that he would support breaking off the FBI's ""intel shops"" to focus on crime-fighting.James Gagliano, a retired FBI supervisor, said he would like to see more specific information about the new priorities but was heartened by an enhanced violent crime focus so long as other initiatives weren't abandoned.""Mission priorities change,"" Gagliano said. ""The threat matrix changes. You've got to constantly get out in front of that.""Terrorism threats persist The Trump administration has touted several terrorism successes, including the arrests of a suspected participant in a suicide bombing at the Kabul airport that killed 13 American servicemembers and of an ex-Michigan National Guard member on charges of plotting a military base attack on behalf of the Islamic State.But the administration is also employing a broad definition of what it believes constitutes terrorism.FBI and Justice Department officials see the fight against transnational gangs as part of their counterterrorism mandate, taking advantage of the Trump administration's designation of the violent street gangs MS-13 and Tren de Aragua as foreign terrorist organizations to bring terrorism-related charges against defendants, including a Venezuelan man suspected of being a high-ranking TdA member and a Utah father-son suspected of providing material support to a Mexican cartel - a charge typically used for cases involving groups like the Islamic State and al-Qaida.A former Justice Department terrorism prosecutor, Patel has called the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Forces - interagency units in the bureau's 55 field offices - as ""shining examples"" of its mission. Those task forces spent years pursuing suspects in the Capitol riot but have now been enlisted to track down cartel members, he has said.After an Egyptian man whose work authorization in the US had expired was arrested on charges of using a homemade flamethrower and Molotov cocktails to attack a group drawing attention to Israeli hostages in Gaza, administration officials held up the case as proof of their philosophy that immigration enforcement is tantamount to protecting national security.The FBI says its domestic terrorism investigations continue uninterrupted, though Patel at times has discussed the threat in different terms than Wray, who led the bureau as it investigated the Capitol riot and who cited it as evidence of the dangers of homegrown extremists. At hearings last month, Patel pointed to a string of arsons and vandalism acts at Tesla dealerships as domestic terrorism acts that commanded the FBI's resources and attention.As it reconfigures its resources, the FBI has moved to reassign some agents focused on domestic terrorism to a new task force set up to investigate the Oct. 7 Hamas attack and its aftermath, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss personnel moves.One national security concern Patel has preached continuity on in public is the threat from China, which he said in a recent Fox News interview keeps him up at night. Wray often called China the gravest long-term threat to national security, and when he stepped aside in January the FBI was contending with an espionage operation that gave officials in Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans.There are signs of a broader national security realignment.A task force tracking foreign influence, like Russia's attempts to interfere in American democracy, was disbanded and the Justice Department has scaled back criminal enforcement of a statute requiring registration of US lobbying on behalf of foreign entities.All of that concerns retired FBI supervisor Frank Montoya, a long time counterintelligence official who says fentanyl and drug cartels are not ""existential"" threats in the same way Russia and China are. When it comes to complicated, interagency espionage work, the FBI, he said, has always ""been the glue that made it all work.""Patel makes no apologies for priorities he says come from the White House.""President Trump has set some priorities out in a new focus for federal law enforcement,"" he has said. ""The FBI has heard those directions, and we are determined to deliver on our crime-fighting and national security mission with renewed vigor.""","A revised FBI priority list on its website places ""Crush Violent Crime"" at the top. President Trump has made a crackdown on illegal immigration, cartels and transnational gangs a cornerstone of his administration. Some former officials are concerned the stepped-up focus on violent crime and immigration risks deflecting attention from more sophisticated threats.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121717943,imgsize-73290,width-400,resizemode-4/121717943.jpg"

The high-profile feud between Elon Musk and Donald Trump has taken another twist, with Elon’s father, Errol Musk suggesting his son is suffering from “PTSD from the White House.”Errol admitted Elon may have “made a mistake” by backing Trump’s re-election, reports the Daily Mail,Speaking in Moscow, where he is attending a forum organised by close aides of Russian President Vladimir Putin , Errol Musk said the Elon is stressed and exhausted from months of political tension. Errol likened the public fallout between Elon and Trump to a failing marriage.“So at the moment, Elon is inclined to say that he's made a mistake,” Errol told Russian outlet Izvestia, adding, “Trump will prevail. He's the president, he was elected as the president.”The clash between the world's richest man and the MAGA supremo began after Musk, who donated millions to Trump’s 2024 campaign and later took a role in the White House, openly criticised a sweeping new tax and spending bill. Musk also stirred controversy after claiming Trump’s name appeared in files related to pedophile Jeffrey Epstein , a claim he posted on his platform X before later deleting it. The White House dismissed the allegation.Over the weekend, Trump said the relationship was over. “I would assume so, yeah,” he said in a phone interview with NBC, adding, “I'm too busy doing other things.” He warned Musk not to back Democratic candidates in upcoming elections, saying, “If he does, he'll have to pay the consequences for that.""Amid the fallout, Errol Musk has arrived in Moscow to speak at the Future Forum 2050.Russian figures have even offered asylum to Elon. “You are respected in Russia,” wrote former space agency chief Dmitry Rogozin. “If you encounter insurmountable problems in the US, come to us and become one of us.”Speaking to Russian state-backed Tsargrad TV, Errol said, “They’ve had five months at least of intense repair work, removing all the spurious opposition, all the crazies and so on. They've been under a lot of stress.”“He’s tired, he’s stressed,” he added. “Five months of continuous stress, continuous, continuous stress, stress, stress. And then in the end, it's just him and Trump left… They still don't know what to do, so they fight with each other until they can come to normal conditions.”Errol described Elon as “not a great politician,” saying, “He's a great tech innovator and so forth. But his politics is, as I've said before, is a swimming pool with no bottom, it's a swimming pool with no sides.”Errol Musk seemed hopeful for a resolution. “It’s just a small thing. It'll be over tomorrow,” he said.",Errol Musk says his son may have made a mistake by backing Trump's re-election. He likened the public fallout between Elon and Trump to a failing marriage.

CHENNAI: A 27-year-old doctor from Asthampatti near Salem was arrested by the Kodungaiyur police on Saturday for killing a 26-year-old woman who was blackmailing him, police said.Nithya, a resident of Sattuma Nagar, Thiruvottiyur, who was unemployed, falsely claimed to be working with an IT company in Ambattur and extorted money from several people, police said. She began blackmailing Dr Santosh Kumar, whom she befriended on the internet. She extracted more than 8 lakh from him by threatening to send his nude pictures to his family.

Ukraine's ""creativity"", including its massive ""Spider's web"" drone attack deep inside Russia, holds profound lessons for Western militaries, the top Nato commander overseeing battlefield innovation told AFP.""What the Ukrainians did in Russia was a Trojan horse - and the trojan horse was thousands of years ago,"" French Admiral Pierre Vandier, Nato's Supreme Allied Commander Transformation, said in an interview.""Today, we see this kind of tactic being reinvented by technical and industrial creativity.""Vandier said the operation showed how crucial innovation and adaptation were for victory, as modern warfare changes at lightning speed.""It was a real coup.""""We are entering a dynamic era where armies must rely on both major planning but also adaptive planning,"" the navy commander said.""We will witness continuous innovation where, week by week, month by month or year by year, we will be able to invent things we hadn't anticipated.""- 'Must act quickly' -Faced with the Russian threat, Nato this week adopted new objectives for its defence capabilities to ensure it will be able to repel Moscow.But Western intelligence agencies have warned that the Kremlin is reconstituting its forces at a pace far outstripping Nato and could be ready to attack the alliance in as little as four years.""Time is truly a crucial parameter. We must act quickly,"" Vandier said.The admiral, who previously commanded France's flagship Charles De Gaulle aircraft carrier, said Nato needed to amass the forces to dissuade any adversary from trying an attack.""When you say 'I'm defending myself', you have the weapons to defend. When you say you deter, you have the weapons to deter,"" he said.""That's what should prevent war - making the adversary think: ""Tomorrow morning, I won't win.""Nato countries under pressure from US President Donald Trump are expected to agree a major increase in their defence spending target at a summit in The Hague this month.That should see a dramatic surge in spending on military hardware.But if cheap Ukrainian drones can inflict billions of dollars in damage on Russian bombers, is it still worth investing in vastly expensive systems?""No-one in the military sphere will tell you that we can do without what we'll call traditional equipment,"" Vandier said.""However, we are certain we need new equipment to complement it.""Officials say that over 70 percent of battlefield casualties in Ukraine are caused by drones.But while drones are indispensable in modern warfare, they are not omnipotent.""Today, you won't cross the Atlantic with a 10-meter-long (33-foot-long) drone.

'Intercepted and kidnapped,' claims Thunberg



‘Selfie yacht passengers safe'



'Ways to deliver aid that doesn't involve Instagram selfies'







Climate activist Greta Thunberg , en route to war-torn Gaza, on Monday claimed that she had been kidnapped by Israeli forces and appealed for help. In response, Israeli authorities said that the aid vessel carrying Thunberg and other activists had been ""diverted"" to Israel and all the passengers, including Greta, were safe.“If you see this video, we are being intercepted and kidnapped in international waters by the Israeli occupational forces, or forces that support Israel,"" Thunberg said in the clip.Israel foreign ministry condemned this move calling it a ""publicity"" stunt and informed that ""selfie yacht"" was being diverted to Israel. It advised the passengers to return to their home countries.The October 7 Hamas-led attack killed about 1,200 people in Israel and took 251 hostages, with 55 still held—many presumed dead. In response, Israel’s military campaign has killed over 54,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children according to Gaza’s health ministry. The war has devastated Gaza, displacing nearly 90% of its population and leaving residents heavily reliant on international aid.Thunberg, and 11 other activists were on their way to Gaza to deliver aid when the climate activist claimed that their ship had been ""intercepted and kidnapped"" by Israeli forces in the international waters.She further appealed the Swedish government to release her.“My name is Greta Thunberg, and I am from Sweden. If you see this video, we are being intercepted and kidnapped in international waters by the Israeli occupational forces, or forces that support Israel. I urge all my friends, family and comrades to put pressure on the Swedish government to release me and the others as soon as possible,” she said.The Madleen, which set sail from Sicily a week ago, was organised by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition. During its journey, the vessel stopped on Thursday to rescue four migrants who had leapt into the sea in an attempt to escape detention by the Libyan coast guard.Rima Hassan, a French member of the European Parliament of Palestinian origin, was also among the volunteers on the vessel. She has been denied entry into Israel due to her outspoken criticism of Israeli policies toward Palestinians.Taking a swipe at the activists, Israel posted a video of the ship in which the IDF was seen providing food and water to those aboard. Calling them ""selfie yacht passengers"" it said that the ""show is over"". In another post, it informed that Thunberg was on ""her way to Israel, safe and in good spirits"".""Greta Thunberg is currently on her way to Israel, safe and in good spirits,"" it said.""All the passengers of the ‘selfie yacht’ are safe and unharmed.

'How dumb can she be?' Democrats' claim of 'peaceful' LA protests invites backlash; TV shows burning cars,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-dumb-can-she-be-democrats-claim-of-peaceful-la-protests-invites-backlash-tv-shows-burning-cars/articleshow/121715727.cms,"Nanette Barragán calls the Los Angeles riots ""Peaceful Protests"" on CNN





Democratic Representative Nanette Barragán is under fire on social media after calling the recent unrest in Los Angeles “peaceful protests” and urging for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to leave the community.Barragán represents parts of southern Los Angeles. She made the remarks during an appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday, as television footage showed a car engulfed in flames amid rising tensions following immigration raids and violent clashes over the weekend.“It’s a concern,” Barragán said when asked about US President Donald Trump ’s deployment of 2,000 California National Guard troops to the city. “It’s going to escalate the situation. People are going to protest because they’re angry about the situation.”The deployment came after a weekend of chaos that saw federal agents clash with demonstrators. On Saturday night, officers fired tear gas, pepper balls and flash-bang explosives at protesters near a Home Depot in Paramount, California, after rocks and cement were thrown at law enforcement vehicles. A day earlier, demonstrators had gathered outside a federal detention facility demanding the release of more than 40 individuals held for immigration violations.Police in riot gear responded with tear gas.In a statement to HuffPost, Barragán said she had been informed by local law enforcement that the California National Guard would remain in the city for 30 days. She added that department of homeland security officials had told officers that ICE would be carrying out arrests over the same period.“Given [President Donald] Trump’s reasoning for mobilising the National Guard, we expect them to be deployed during that same time frame,” Barragán said.The White House said the deployment was meant to address “lawlessness that has been allowed to fester” in the city. National Guard troops began arriving in Los Angeles on Sunday morning.California governor Gavin Newsom criticised the move, calling it a stunt. “The federal government is taking over the California National Guard and deploying 2,000 soldiers in Los Angeles — not because there is a shortage of law enforcement, but because they want a spectacle,” he posted on X. “Don’t give them one. Never use violence. Speak out peacefully.”Barragán acknowledged that violence had occurred, but insisted the protests were rooted in legitimate frustration with the presence of federal immigration officers.“We have to remember why this is happening,” she said. “It’s happening because of everything that’s been going on the last couple of months. And this community is saying, ‘We don’t want ICE in our community. We want you out.’”The Congresswoman encouraged protesters to remain non-violent, saying, “Protesters who are violent should be arrested and prosecuted,” but she also accused federal officers of being aggressive regardless of protester behaviour.“The president is sending the National Guard because he doesn’t like the scenes, the scenes of people peacefully protesting,” Barragán said.According to the Associated Press, ICE officials have detained at least 100 people in Los Angeles over the past week on immigration charges.",Democratic Representative Nanette Barragán is under fire on social media.

WASHINGTON: With an uncharacteristically feistiness, speaker Mike Johnson took clear sides Sunday in President Trump's breakup with billionaire Elon Musk.The Republican House leader and staunch Trump ally said Musk's criticism of GOP's massive tax and budget policy bill will not derail the measure, and he downplayed Musk's influence over GOP-controlled Congress. ""I didn't go out to craft a piece of legislation to please the richest man in the world,"" Johnson said, ""What we're trying to do is help hardworking Americans who are trying to provide for their families and make ends meet.""Johnson said he has exchanged text messages with Musk since the former chief of department of govt efficiency (DOGE) came out against the GOP bill.Musk called it an ""abomination"" that would add to US debts and threaten economic stability. He urged voters to flood Capitol Hill with calls to vote against the measure, which is pending in the senate after clearing the House. His criticism sparked an angry social media back-and-forth with Trump.Johnson was dismissive of Musk's threats to finance opponents - even Democrats - of Republican members who back the bill. ""We've got almost no calls to the offices... And I think that indicates people are taking a wait and see attitude. Some who may be convinced by some of his arguments, but rest understand: this is a very exciting piece of legislation.""",The Republican House leader and staunch Trump ally said Musk's criticism of GOP's massive tax and budget policy bill will not derail the measure.

""I think there's a good possibility that we could do it without military force,"" Trump said in March, but added he would not ""take anything off the table.""Macron, who has seen in the provocations directed at Europe by Trump govt an opportunity for European assertion of its power, will be the first foreign head of state to go to Greenland since Trump embarked on his annexation campaign this year.

Early this year, France's foreign minister, Jean-Noel Barrot, offered to send troops to help defend the island. Denmark demurred.Macron will stop in Greenland on his way to the G-7 meeting in Canada that runs from June 15 to 17.

Who was Muhammad Sinwar?







The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) and Shin Bet security agency on Sunday confirmed that the body of Hamas leader Muhammad Sinwar was found inside a tunnel located under the European Hospital in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza.""Mohammad Sinwar was responsible for the deaths of countless civilians. He was eliminated in an IDF & ISA strike on May 13,"" IDF said in a post on X.""His body was found beneath the European hospital in Khan Yunis—more proof of how Sinwar, and Hamas, hide behind their civilians and purposely embed themselves in civilian areas, such as hospitals,"" the post further said, adding, ""He died the way he lived—underground.""According to the military, the tunnel was used by Hamas as a command center, The Times of Israel reported.Israeli fighter jets bombarded the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis on May 13 to kill Muhammad Sinwar, one of Hamas' remaining top leaders in the enclaveTroops reached the hospital several days earlier, and later retrieved the body of Sinwar along with the bodies of other Hamas members, as per The Times of Israel report.The Israeli military said that Sinwar was killed in an Israeli strike on the tunnel on May 13. The same strike also killed Muhammad Shabana, the commander of Hamas’ Rafah Brigade, and Mahdi Quara, commander of the group’s South Khan Younis Battalion.The IDF added that it found several items belonging to Sinwar and Shabana inside the tunnel, including ID cards. Weapons were also recovered.The IDF said that the identification process has confirmed that one of the bodies belongs to Sinwar, while the other bodies are still being identified.Earlier in May, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing Hamas and Arab officials, that the meeting between Hamas leaders was held to talk about their position on ceasefire negotiations and a hostage deal, among other topics. After learning of the gathering, the Israeli Air Force began preparing for a strike, The Times of Israel's report said. Senior officers believed it might be canceled over concerns that hostages could be nearby, as Sinwar was known to keep them close.But once intelligence showed that no hostages were near the commanders, the Israeli air force was given approval to carry out the attack. Jets were launched, and the strike was executed.Muhammad Sinwar, a senior military figure in Hamas, was the younger brother of former Hamas leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar. He had been on Israel’s most wanted list for several months.Israeli officials said Sinwar had resisted efforts to negotiate a hostage deal and had blocked progress toward a ceasefire. After the death of Muhammad Deif, Hamas’s top military commander, in July 2024, Sinwar took over the group’s military operations.Yahya Sinwar had been made the overall Hamas leader after Israel killed Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in the same month. When Yahya Sinwar was killed in combat in October 2024, Muhammad Sinwar became the leader of Hamas in the Gaza Strip.","The body of Hamas leader Muhammad Sinwar was found inside a tunnel located under the European Hospital in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza.

The IRS Faceoff That Sparked the Breakdown



Blow by Blow



Elon Musk sported a black eye at the Oval Office press meet and blamed his son X for it.

A Partnership Implodes



Pride, Power, and the Politics of Ego



The Fallout: Contracts, NASA, and the “America Party”



Final Thought







Betteridge’s law of headlines states that any headline ending in a question mark can be answered with the word “no.” But that’s not the case here. As far as reports—and word from the horse’s mouth are concerned—it would appear that, during this Pride Month, Elon Musk , the richest man in the world, did lose at fisticuffs to Scott Bessent, an openly gay member of the Trump cabinet.And it happened in the West Wing—which is fitting, because Donald Trump is the first WWE Hall of Famer to have served as President of the United States.Musk, once Trump’s most powerful private-sector ally, had entered the Oval Office to lobby for his pick to head the IRS. Bessent, a Yale-educated hedge fund veteran and one of the highest-ranking openly gay officials in the Republican Party, had other plans. What began as a policy disagreement spilled into the hallway. By the end of it, Musk had to be escorted out of the White House—visibly injured and politically diminished.The tension had been building for months. In mid-April, Musk and Bessent met with President Trump to argue over who should become acting IRS Commissioner. Musk supported Gary Shapley, a former IRS investigator known for his role in the Hunter Biden whistleblower case. Bessent pushed for Michael Faulkender, a MAGA-aligned economist with prior experience at the Treasury.Trump ultimately sided with Bessent.That single decision triggered a rapid unravelling. For Musk—who had spent months trying to position himself as the federal government’s chief efficiency czar—being overruled on IRS leadership was a stinging blow. But the real damage came after the meeting.After leaving the Oval Office, Musk and Bessent exchanged words in the hallway. According to multiple accounts relayed by Stephen K. Bannon, the former Trump adviser, Bessent accused Musk of failing to deliver on his promise to uncover “more than $1 trillion” in government waste. “You’re a fraud. You’re a total fraud,” Bessent reportedly said.Musk, furious, slammed his shoulder into Bessent’s rib cage “like a rugby player.” Bessent hit back. The clash escalated until aides rushed in to separate the two, just outside the national security adviser’s office. Musk was then escorted out of the building. Trump, informed moments later, was overheard muttering, “This is too much.”Days later, Musk appeared at a press event with a black eye, which he claimed came from “play-fighting with his son.” White House officials, however, made no effort to deny the hallway brawl.The fight marked the symbolic collapse of one of the most unconventional political alliances in modern American history. Musk, who had moved into the Lincoln Bedroom and assumed a major role in shaping Trump’s government reform agenda, quickly fell from grace.His early moves—including a mass email demanding that all federal employees submit weekly “five accomplishments” reports—alienated agencies and judges alike. His DOGE initiative (Department of Government Efficiency), which aimed to cut federal bureaucracy with AI audits and massive layoffs, drew resistance from seasoned staffers and even MAGA loyalists.By April, Musk had become a lightning rod. Protesters outside federal buildings held signs reading, “No One Voted for Elon Musk.” Inside the White House, his influence waned. Bessent’s quiet but effective resistance, grounded in budget discipline and political capital, began to prevail.That all this happened just weeks before Pride Month lent the episode a layer of cultural symbolism.Bessent, long respected for his economic acumen, had already broken barriers as an openly gay Republican in the highest echelons of financial policymaking. But the confrontation with Musk—and the fact that he walked away with Trump’s confidence and no public reprimand—cemented his role as a formidable power player in the second Trump administration.While Musk’s methods relied on spectacle, Bessent operated through strategy—and, in this case, personal resolve.The West Wing brawl was just one rupture in a broader collapse. By May, Trump began actively distancing himself from Musk—questioning his drug use, threatening to review federal contracts with Tesla and SpaceX, and yanking Jared Isaacman’s NASA nomination, which Musk had championed.Musk, meanwhile, lashed out online. He attacked Trump’s landmark tax and spending bill and teased the launch of a third party, calling it The America Party. He also doubled down on claims that Trump had ties to Jeffrey Epstein—a charge he has not substantiated.Trump responded with silence at first, then blunt disappointment. “I’m very disappointed in Elon,” he told reporters. He reportedly told aides he was considering selling his Tesla Model S, which had been parked outside the White House since March.What started as a collaboration between two disruptors—one from politics, the other from tech—ended in recriminations, hallway brawls, and the exposure of vastly different worldviews. Musk came to Washington to dismantle the system. He left having been outmanoeuvred, outpunched, and—quite literally—shown the door.Scott Bessent didn’t tweet. He didn’t gloat. He just walked away, still Treasury Secretary, with his pick running the IRS and his credibility enhanced.In Washington, strength isn’t measured in followers or stock price. It’s measured in who the President trusts when things get messy. And during Pride Month 2025, amid a mess of egos, algorithms, and ambition, it was the gay banker who kept his footing—while Elon Musk lost his.","Elon Musk and Scott Bessent, an openly gay member of the Trump cabinet, clashed in the West Wing.

Musk-Trump breakup over? Elon posts US President's post slamming Gavin Newsom over LA riots; National Guard deployed amid rising unrest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/musk-trump-breakup-over-elon-posts-us-presidents-post-slamming-gavin-newsom-over-la-riots-national-guard-deployed-amid-rising-unrest/articleshow/121717602.cms,"Signs show Trump-Musk rift appears to be ending





In what appears to be a brief thaw in the heated feud between Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump , the tech billionaire reshared a Truth Social post by the MAGA supremo targeting California governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass.This moment of alignment comes after a week of bitter exchanges between the two, which included Musk’s explosive claim that Trump appeared in Jeffrey Epstein ’s files and Trump branding Musk as “Crazy.”The Truth Social post addressed the ongoing riots in Los Angeles, where thousands have protested against the Trump administration’s immigration policies, including recent ICE detentions. The unrest escalated to the point where the National Guard was deployed to control the large-scale demonstrations.Trump wrote: ""Governor Gavin Newscum and “Mayor” Bass should apologize to the people of Los Angeles for the absolutely horrible job that they have done, and this now includes the ongoing L.A. riots. These are not protesters, they are troublemakers and insurrectionists. Remember, NO MASKS!""Protesters set fire to vehicles, threw objects, and chanted slogans against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations, which resulted in the arrest of several people alleged to be undocumented immigrants and gang members.These raids sparked outrage within Los Angeles’s large Latino community.Despite this apparent moment of unity, Musk and Trump have grown distant since Musk’s controversial claims regarding the Epstein files, which he later retracted. Tensions have also risen since March, when Trump curtailed the powers of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a unit Musk had headed.Musk formally stepped down from his role at DOGE on May 1 during a low-key White House ceremony, where Trump thanked him for his service and presented him with a ceremonial “golden key” to the White House.The tech entrepreneur has also criticised Trump’s “one big beautiful bill,” expressing concerns that the Office of Budget and Budgetary Bureau (OBBB) would significantly increase the US public debt.Unable to sway Trump or Republican lawmakers, Musk launched a “Kill the Bill” campaign on X, leading to a public and heated showdown with the president.In a recent interview aboard Air Force One, when asked about Elon Musk and Tesla’s future, Trump reassured, “He’ll be ok.”Musk was the main right-hand for Trump’s Oval Office bid in the 2024 presidential campaign and went toe to toe with Trump on governmental policies while also downplaying Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris.","Musk reshared a Truth Social post by the MAGA supremo targeting California governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass.

Here are the top 10 things to know about the LA protest:

Protesters torched vehicles and disrupted traffic, while law enforcement responded with flash-bangs and smoke grenades to disperse crowds from key areas.

At least three self-driving Waymo vehicles were set on fire, with two others vandalised, highlighting anger at both immigration policy and Silicon Valley’s presence.

A major freeway was blocked for over an hour as protesters took to the roads before being pushed back by the California Highway Patrol .

. Soldiers from California's 79th Infantry Brigade were stationed across the city, wearing full camouflage and armed with live rounds, prompting criticism that their presence was more about intimidation than order.

Trump defended his decision, suggesting a broader deployment of troops may follow. He also hinted at invoking the Insurrection Act, which permits military use in domestic unrest.

US Northern Command confirmed that around 500 Marines were in a ""prepared to deploy"" state to support federal operations if needed.

Leading Democrats, including former Vice President Kamala Harris, slammed the deployment as a ""dangerous escalation meant to provoke chaos"".

House Speaker Mike Johnson defended Trump’s action, accusing governor Newsom of failing to maintain law and order in the state.

Many demonstrators said the Guard’s presence was a scare tactic. “These protests have been peaceful,” protester Thomas Henning told news agency AFP. “It’s intimidation, plain and simple,"" he added.

Despite the unrest, a CBS News poll taken before the protests showed that a slight majority of Americans supported the ongoing immigration crackdown.





Tensions flared in Los Angeles on Sunday as demonstrators clashed with police and set cars ablaze, protesting a series of immigration raids and the controversial deployment of National Guard troops by United States President Donald Trump. The unrest marked the third consecutive day of protests in California’s most populous city.Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations, which resulted in the arrests of several individuals alleged to be undocumented immigrants and gang members, have sparked outrage in the city’s large Latino community. The daylight raids and the federal response have only added fuel to the fire.The tension escalated after a large crowd gathered near the Los Angeles Federal Building at 4 pm to protest against the enforcement action, condemning the crackdown. The demonstrators called for the freedom of Service Employees International Union California President David Huerta.According to the labour union's statement, Huerta sustained injuries and was taken into custody while recording documentation of the raid.Protesters assembled outside Ambiance Apparel's warehouse, offering legal guidance to those detained within. They positioned themselves atop a long bed truck in the street, causing traffic disruptions on the busy thoroughfare.California Governor Gavin Newsom condemned Trump’s move to bypass state authority and activate National Guard units without his consent.“We didn’t have a problem until Trump got involved,” Newsom wrote on X (formerly Twitter). “This is a serious breach of state sovereignty — inflaming tensions while pulling resources from where they’re actually needed. Rescind the order. Return control to California.”","Tensions flared in Los Angeles on Sunday as demonstrators clashed with police and set cars ablaze, protesting a series of immigration raids.
