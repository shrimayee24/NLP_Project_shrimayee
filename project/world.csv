Easy hospital access to every room, ward



Sanjay Ray and his police connection



Questions over Mamata government's inquiry panel



Accused went back to police barrack to sleep after committing crime



(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: Amid outrage across the country over the Kolkata doctor rape and murder case, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday gave an ultimatum to police saying if it does not solve the case by Sunday, she would hand over the probe to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).""If the police are unable to solve this by Sunday, we will hand over the case to the CBI,"" Mamata said after meeting the family of the deceased doctor.'The Bengal CM, who has many times hit out the CBI accusing it of working on the instructions of the BJP-led Centre, also added, ""However, the success rate of the central probe agency is very low.""The body of a 31-year-old doctor was found at Kolkata's RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on Friday morning.A day later, Kolkata Police arrested a civic volunteer, said to be the main accused in the case. The gruesome details of the rape-murder have sent chills across the nation prompting the doctors to go on a pan-India strike in protest.Meanwhile, three PILs were also filed in Calcutta High Court seeking a CBI investigation into the case.But when the accused is already in 14-day judicial custody, then why the opposition and others are asking for a CBI probe?The allegations of foul play started as the family of the deceased doctor alleged rape and murder. Her family, while speaking to Metro, alleged that the hospital initially tried to cover up the case by calling it suicide.""We want justice for our daughter. She did not deserve this. We want the truth to come out. I wonder why the hospital authorities had initially told us that she had committed suicide. What were they trying to hide?"" he said.Later, the police ruled out suicide after the initial autopsy report indicated that she was murdered after being sexually assaulted.The report stated, ""There was bleeding from both her eyes and mouth and injuries over the face. The victim was also bleeding from her private parts. She also has injuries in her belly, left leg... neck, in her right hand, ring finger and... lips.""Meanwhile, another police officer said that circumstantial evidence indicated a possibility that the woman doctor was first murdered and then raped by the arrested accused.""There is evidence that the doctor was sleeping alone in the seminar hall of the hospital when she was attacked by the accused. The woman tried to resist but was strangled to death. To make sure she was dead, he also smothered her. There is a possibility that the accused could have raped her after the murder,"" the officer told PTI.""It is a very shameful incident. The inquiry should be conducted properly. We demand a CBI inquiry because the police first said that it was a case of suicide and then said that it was a murder case. The accused they have arrested is also a part of the police administration,"" Union Minister Sukanta Majumdar said.The accused, who was reportedly an outsider frequenting the hospital premises, was arrested and charged under Sections 64 (rape) and 103 (murder) of BNS.According to reports, Sanjay Ray had access to every part of the hospital including rooms and wards. The lapse points to a nexus between security and the touts.His identity as a ""police guy"" also helped him in this case.The woman doctor was found dead in a seminar room in the hospital in the morning. The reports of how easily the accused was able to access the room she was sleeping in, have led to a huge outrage among doctors over security at a government-run hospital.Later, the hospital authorities expelled the two security persons contractually employed at the emergency ward for not discharging their duties properly which, in a way, led to the crime.The police investigation revealed that Ray was a civic volunteer of Kolkata Police, which he misused to commit the crime.Ray, a mere civic volunteer, enjoyed privileges and freedom of movement like the regular policemen. The initial investigation revealed he used to live at a police barrack in North Kolkata which is meant for regular cops in the permanent payroll, news agency IANS sources said.According to IANS, the investigating officials also found personal numbers of some lower-ranking police officers and staff from the accused's mobile phone.Roy, who is a trained boxer, got close to a few senior police officers over the years, following which he was moved to the Kolkata Police Welfare Board and posted to the police outpost at the state-run RG Kar Medical College and Hospital where the incident happened.""He had access to all departments owing to his proximity with some senior police officers and the hospital authorities. Nobody had the guts to stop his unhindered movements in and around the hospital,"" an officer told PTI.""There is ample evidence that the accused was throwing his weight around because of his proximity with senior police officers. This aspect is also under investigation,"" the officer said.The opposition raised questions as the West Bengal government formed a panel to probe the case. Demanding a CBI probe, the leader of the opposition in the West Bengal Legislative Assembly Suvendu Adhikari said, ""Instead of addressing the issue seriously, the State Government has formed an 11-member inquiry committee, which bizarrely includes some interns. It seems the government is either trying to cover up its negligence or is not taking this matter seriously.""""I urge the student community, especially medical students, to protest vigorously against the State Government's complacent attitude. I will provide all the support necessary to ensure justice for the deceased student,"" the BJP leader said.BJP MLA Agnimitra Paul also demanded a CBI investigation and a re-postmortem by a Central Government hospital.""The condition in which her body was found--completely naked with bruises--suggests she was raped and then murdered. We demand a CBI investigation. A postmortem should not be conducted after the evening, yet it was done here. If the postmortem is carried out under the state system, the truth will be buried,"" Paul said.The police reconstructed the crime scene without the presence of the arrested accused on Sunday. After committing the crime, the accused reportedly went to a police barrack and slept until Friday morning.""We are also talking to persons who were on duty on Thursday night till the next morning. CCTV footage is also being checked,"" Kolkata Police Commissioner Vineet Goyal said.The police have seized the clothes and shoes worn by the accused during the crime. The officer stated that the accused had washed the clothes he was wearing during the crime, but his shoes, which had blood stains on them, were found during a search at the place he was staying.When asked if anyone else was involved in the crime along with the arrested accused, the officer said, ""As of now there is no evidence of that.""","West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee gave an ultimatum to police saying if it does not solve the case by Sunday, she would hand over the probe to the Central Bureau of Investigation.

Kamala to take a leaf from Obama playbook? How Harris presidency might differ from Biden's,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-to-take-a-leaf-from-the-obama-playbook-how-harris-presidency-might-differ-from-bidens-us-election/articleshow/112472107.cms,"‘Unconditionality’ to continue?

Exclusive: On dealing with anti-democratic world leaders, Obama says 'it's complicated'

‘Discomfiture, if not distaste’

Presidential Candidate Kamala Harris on Kashmir - Sep 13, 2019

NEW DELHI: “There are millions in America, who have roots in India. Some of them sit proudly in this US Congress. There is one behind me, who has made history,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in his widely acclaimed second address to the US congress, referring to Kamala Harris , the first woman of Black and Indian descent to be elected to the post of vice-president—who, perhaps in less than 100 days like Modi alluded to, may make history yet again and possibly some day very well stand beside the prime minister of the most populous nation as the 47th president of the United States of America.The world’s oldest and largest democracies have come a long way from once being estranged to engaged and to now, touted by few like ambassador Eric Garcetti as the “consequential” relationship of the century.And the partnership is expected to remain more or less the same with bipartisan support, regardless of who takes the reins in the Oval office come January.However, for New Delhi, even as the relationship on the bilateral and the multilateral fronts will continue on an upward trajectory, the real diplomatic challenge will come from the messaging, particularly Washington 's proclivity to turn into a pedantic headmaster and give lectures on 'human rights abuses' and 'treatment of minorities'.The Veep’s independent foreign policy positions on a number of issues remain largely ambiguous for any sweeping interpretation, however what is clear is by the looks of it is, that the optics may be different—vividly in contrast to the Trump or even the current government led by Biden, that were willing to go that extra mile to court an ascending India and cozy up to a hugely popular prime minister, come what may.A striking display of this “unconditionality” was when western leaders, including Biden chose to play softball over PM Modi’s bear hug to President Putin that coincided with the Nato summit and a Russian attack that left scores of children dead in Ukraine. Though they may have been privately irked about the embrace and bad optics, the noise is for Modi to rise above as a global player, peacemaker by leveraging his cordial relationship with not just Putin but leaders in other western capitals as well.Another instance of this was when Biden chose to celebrate India’s airbus A-350 deal in a call with Prime Minister Modi last year while glossing over a BBC tax raid that was happening in the capital on the same day. The reaction wasn't very different from Trump's, who stayed mum during his stay in Delhi when the national capital witnessed riots, according to one well-placed American embassy source.However, looking at how Kamala Harris has set off since being named candidate, “in all likelihood, the current VP will want to inherit a lot of aspects from Obama and want to be seen as that president of the free world, who measured no words to raise the issues around alleged minority freedoms and human rights,” the source said.Barack Obama in and out of office has not shied away from putting his views on record publicly. The former president in 2023 just as Prime Minister Modi made his historic state visit to the United States, latched on to similar rhetoric from an earlier public statement made in Delhi as a president. He had then controversially said ,“India would pull apart if the rights of ethnic minorities are not protected,” insinuating Biden to bring up the issue of human rights publicly with Modi.With Kamala shifting tone & tenor and looking to appear different from Biden, a messaging that might find some uncomfortable quarters in New Delhi is possible, if Americans vote Harris into the oval office, the source added.The now Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in her four years as vice-president, if anything has “manifested discomfiture, if not distaste to Prime Minister Modi’s certain policies”, said professor of international afairs at Goa university, Dattesh Prabhu Parulekar.Her recent “will not be silent” response to Netanyahu sparked some minds to draw on memories from the VP’s veiled swipe at Prime Minister Modi’s “human right record” and “treatment of minorities”.Before hosting Prime Minister Modi for a state luncheon during his visit in September 2021, the vice-president in her first meeting with Modi played both the good and the bad cop. She gently pushed Modi saying that as democracies around the world are under threat,“it is imperative that we defend democratic principles and institutions within our respective countries.”“I know from personal experience and from my family of the commitment of the Indian people to democracy,” she said, “and the work that needs to be done, so that we can begin to imagine, and then actually achieve, our vision for democratic principles and institutions.”After all, the then senator running for president just as India also abrogated Article 370, was vocal on the situation that emerged in Kashmir after the revocation. In her campaign trail, she weighed in on a response to the alleged human rights situation in Kashmir and said, “We have to remind the Kashmiris that they are not alone in the world. There is a need to intervene if the situation demands.”She also stood up for her fellow Indian-origin Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal when external affairs minister S Jaishankar abruptly canceled to attend a meeting in the US over her participation.“It’s wrong for any foreign government to tell Congress what members are allowed in meetings on Capitol Hill,” Harris had back then said in a tweet. While many other Congress members also decried the Kashmir situation, her comments struck some alarm in Delhi because of her roots to this country.Jayapal once moved a resolution on the Kashmir issue in the House of Representatives, and later during Modi’s second state visit in 2023, spearheaded a campaign to force Biden to pull the strings publicly on Modi about alleged human rights violations.And the two-time district attorney, scrambling to make the election contest a fight between a “prosecutor vs convicted felon Trump”, may not shed off her “activist DNA” with India too, similar to what has happened off late against Netanyahu, Dattesh said.The vice-president, despite having an Indian connection, has kept it at an arm’s distance, leaving GOP and the presidential nominee Donald Trump with fodder to run a campaign— no stranger to demagoguery and casting aspersions over identity. And also Maga republicans with Indian origin politicians like Vivek Ramasamy going so far as to claim Indian Americans are “offended” by the former staying aloof from her Indian identity.Unlike Rishi Sunak in the UK, who made no qualms to woo the ever growing Indian diaspora and to project himself as a “proud Hindu” running to become the PM of UK, Kamala Harris on the other hand vying to become the 47th president of the ‘free world’ has walked a thin line, choosing to dot the I’s and cross the T’s.The ruling Modi government to which the three D’s (Democracy, demography, diaspora) have featured as a cornerstone of its foreign policy, will find Kamala Harris toeing a safe line in her interactions with the Indian American and Hindu American diaspora less attractive. The fact that the VP toured around India, but never to India in her four years perhaps adds to the sentiment.The Modi government over the years also has become assertive and minced no words to call a spade a spade. If anything, one part of Modi’s immediate reaction to Trump’s assassination attempt was because the former president was his “dear friend”, but reading between the lines, it was India for a change speaking Democracy to Washington, a BJP worker said.“Deeply concerned by the attack on my friend, former President Donald Trump. Violence has no place in democracies,” Modi wrote on X.Kamala, though being late to the race, now leads most polls against Trump lagging behind on the back of the failed assassination attempt that seems to be fading in public memory rather quickly. New Delhi will be watching the developments keenly in Washington and preparing to deal either with Trump for whom ‘America comes first, personal equations next’ or a Kamala Harris with a half Indian identity, wanting ‘to lead the world’s oldest democracy by the power of an example’.","The world’s oldest and largest democracies have come a long way from once being estranged to engaged. The partnership is expected to remain more or less the same with bipartisan support. The real diplomatic challenge will come from the messaging, particularly Washington's proclivity to turn into a pedantic headmaster.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112472270,imgsize-45152,width-400,resizemode-4/112472270.jpg"

The much-anticipated conversation between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Republican US Presidential candidate Donald Trump on X (formerly Twitter) was derailed by a cyber attack . The platform faced a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack disrupting the interview.In a post on X, Musk confirmed the attack saying ""There appears to be a massive DDOS attack on X.Working on shutting it down. Worst case, we will proceed with a smaller number of live listeners and post the conversation later.”“We tested the system with 8 million concurrent listeners earlier today,” Musk wrote in another post, pledging to host the live interview with a limited number of listeners. “We will proceed with the smaller number of concurrent listeners at 8:30 ET and then post the unedited audio immediately thereafter,” he said. The interview was scheduled for 8pm ET.A DDoS or distributed denial of service attack disrupts network services by targeting websites and servers in an attempt to exhaust an application’s resources. The attackers flood the targeted site with errant traffic, resulting in poor website functionality or knocking it offline altogether.A DDoS attack can last hours, or even days. These cyber assaults can also cause multiple disruptions throughout a singular attack.As explained on a Microsoft webpage, during a DDoS attack, multiple computers storm one computer during an attack, pushing out legitimate users. As a result, service can be delayed or otherwise disrupted for a length of time.“It’s possible that hackers can also infiltrate your database during an attack, accessing sensitive information. DDoS attacks can exploit security vulnerabilities and target any endpoint that is reachable, publicly, through the internet,” it said.","The much-anticipated conversation between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Republican US Presidential candidate Donald Trump was derailed by a cyber attack.

The attack saw an explosive detonate near the ship, though ""the vessel and crew are reported safe,"" the UKMTO said.The private security firm Ambrey similarly reported the attack, saying the ship saw ""two 'close-proximity' explosions.""Though the Houthis didn't immediately claim the attack, it sometimes can take hours or even days to acknowledge their assaults. They've also claimed others that apparently haven't happened.The Houthis have targeted more than 70 vessels with missiles and drones in a campaign that has killed four sailors since the start of the war in Gaza in October. They have seized one vessel and sunk two in the time since. Other missiles and drones have been either intercepted by a US-led coalition in the Red Sea or splashed down before reaching their targets.The rebels maintain that their attacks target ships linked to Israel, the United States or the UK as part of a campaign they say seeks to force an end to the war. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran.The Houthis have launched drones and missiles toward Israel, including an attack on July 19 that killed one person and wounded 10 others in Tel Aviv. Israel responded the next day with airstrikes on the Houthi-held port city of Hodeida that hit fuel depots and electrical stations, killing and wounding a number of people, the rebels say.After the strikes, the Houthis paused their attacks until Aug. 3, when they hit a Liberian-flagged container ship traveling through the Gulf of Aden. A Liberian-flagged oil tanker came under a particularly intense series of attacks beginning Aug. 8 likely carried out by the rebels.As Iran threatens to retaliate over Haniyeh, the US military has told the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group to sail more quickly to the area. America also has ordered the the USS Georgia guided missile submarine into the Mideast, while the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier strike group had been in the Gulf of Oman. Additional F-22 fighter jets have flown into the region, while the USS Wasp, a large amphibious assault ship carrying F-35 fighter jets, is in the Mediterranean Sea.","The attack happened around 115 kilometers (70 miles) south of the Houthi-held port city of Hodeida.

Iran's operations have been notable and distinguishable from Russian campaigns for appearing later in the election season and employing cyberattacks more geared toward election conduct than swaying voters.""Concluding the report, Microsoft noted, ""Recent activity suggests the Iranian regime—along with the Kremlin—may be equally engaged in Election 2024.""Politico reported receiving emails starting July 22 from an unidentified AOL account under the name ""Robert."" The emails contained what appeared to be a research dossier prepared by the campaign on Republican vice presidential nominee, Ohio Senator JD Vance. The dossier was dated February 23, nearly five months before Trump selected Vance as his running mate.Reacting to the report, Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung stated, ""These documents were obtained illegally"" and are ""intended to interfere with the 2024 election and sow chaos throughout our democratic process.""Iran's delegation to the United Nations has denied involvement when questioned about the Trump campaign's claims.Despite this, there have been longstanding suspicions regarding Iran's engagement in hacking operations aimed at its adversaries in the Middle East and other regions. Additionally, Tehran has consistently expressed its intention to seek revenge against Trump for the 2020 drone strike he authorized that resulted in the death of prominent Revolutionary Guard General Qassem Soleimani.","The FBI is investigating allegations that sensitive documents from the Trump Campaign were stolen in a cyber attack.

Harris, alongside her running mate Minnesota Governor Tim Walz , is championing a message of optimism, branding their campaign as a team of ""joyful warriors.""In contrast, Trump has adopted a more sombre tone, cautioning about potential national challenges, reported AP.Harris and Walz are actively engaging with voters through a campaign tour of key battleground states , which recently included a high-energy rally in Philadelphia and stops in Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona, and Nevada. However, planned events in Georgia and North Carolina were cancelled due to Tropical Storm Debby. Harris emphasized the theme of joy, saying, ""Thank you for bringing back the joy,"" and branding the Democratic ticket as ""joyful warriors.""Trump, campaigning with his running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance, has taken a different approach. At a recent news conference at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, Trump warned of ""a lot of bad things coming up,"" predicting potential economic decline and other serious challenges. This marks a stark contrast to the optimistic tone of the Harris-Walz campaign.Polling data from The AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research reveals widespread pessimism, with two-thirds of Americans feeling uneasy about the political climate and about 70% believing the country is heading in the wrong direction. Despite this, Trump’s senior adviser, Jason Miller, argues that voters are focused on practical issues, noting, ""That's not making gas or food or housing less expensive.""Vance has echoed Trump’s economic concerns while criticizing the Democratic ticket and defending past remarks. He has underscored Trump’s accomplishments and proposed policies for a second term, while also addressing criticisms of Walz’s military record.Walz is preparing for his first solo events as Harris' running mate, beginning with a speech at the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees convention in Los Angeles. He will also attend fundraisers in Newport Beach, California, and visit additional cities including Denver, Boston, Rhode Island, and Southampton, New York.Trump is scheduled for a live interview on X, the social platform formerly known as Twitter, which he was banned from following the January 6, 2021, Capitol incident. Hosted by Elon Musk, the interview has faced technical issues and has been postponed. Musk, who had previously identified as a Democrat, endorsed Trump’s candidacy after an assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally. The FBI is currently investigating allegations of stolen sensitive documents from the Trump campaign in a recent cyber intrusion.As the campaign progresses, voters will continue to hear from both candidates and their running mates. Harris and Walz will persist in promoting their optimistic vision, while Trump and Vance will highlight potential future challenges. The initial phases of the Harris-Walz campaign have attracted large, enthusiastic crowds with a focus on joy, aiming to contrast with Trump’s more cautionary predictions and appeal to an electorate concerned about the nation’s direction.Tim Walz will continue his campaign this week with various fundraisers and speaking engagements, further reinforcing the optimistic message central to the Harris-Walz campaign.In summary, the contrasting messages from Harris and Trump offer voters distinct visions for the future, reflecting the broader debate on the nation’s path forward.","Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are championing a message of optimism, branding their campaign as a team of ""joyful warriors"" Trump has adopted a more sombre tone, cautioning about potential national challenges.

They are my brothers; we fought together, and we will stay together,” Prof Yunus said during a session with students at Begum Rokeya University. He urged students to protect all Hindu, Christian, and Buddhist families from harm.Thousands of protesters demonstrated in major cities like Dhaka, Chattogram, Barisal, Tangail and Kurigram saying that Hindus have a right to live in Bangladesh.They blocked the Shahbagh intersection in Dhaka for the second consecutive day on Saturday to protest against attacks on homes, shops, and temples in various parts of the country following the ousting of the Sheikh Hasina-led govt.“August 2024: Save Bangladeshi Hindus.

We want answers”, “Hindu persecution in independent Bangladesh, it will not continue”, “Religion is for individuals, the state is for everyone”, and “Ensure the safety of Hindus”.The Hindu minorities demonstrating in Shahbag demanded security for the Hindus and their homes, temples and businesses, the arrest of those who perpetrated violence against them, and compensation for vandalism, loot and torture.Members of minority communities in Bangladesh faced at least 205 incidents of attacks in 52 districts since the ousting of the Sheikh Hasina-led govt on Aug 5, according to two Hindu organisations — Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council and the Bangladesh Puja Udjapan Parishad — in the country.

The couple's joint appearance, their first since the explosive Oprah Winfrey interview, has been branded a ""car crash"" amid allegations of behind-the-scenes tension and anger, as reported by The Mirror.During a recent appearance on GB News, Royal author Angela Levin shared her take on Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's latest interview, claiming that the Duchess of Sussex was ""screaming"" and ""very annoyed"" after the cameras stopped rolling, the Mirror reported.During the CBS Sunday Morning interview, the couple intended to discuss online harm and their philanthropic endeavors. However, the conversation took an unexpected turn when Meghan was questioned about her previously disclosed suicidal thoughts, which she reportedly did not expect. Royal author Angela Levin claims that Markle was visibly upset by the line of questioning, revealing a tense atmosphere that persisted off-camera.""After the interview was over, she was apparently screaming at the producers, very, very annoyed at what they had asked her,"" Levin said on Dan Wootton's show. ""You mustn't do that with Meghan because she's in control. But you could see she couldn't contain her anger, her fury,” she added.Observers and body language experts noted a palpable sense of discomfort between the couple during the interview, according to body language expert Judi James. Harry appeared either bored or distracted, and Meghan’s icy stares seemed to convey dissatisfaction whenever he spoke. Broadcaster Dan Wootton remarked, “It certainly wasn’t a good 43rd birthday for the Duchess of Sussex, was it?”Levin further emphasized the strain in their dynamic, saying, ""Just the same as in and out of the interview, she couldn't stand Harry speaking. She would look at him with such harsh eyes and such a terrible expression on her face because she didn't want him to talk, I imagine. He is really lost at the moment... I think that he's in a very, very bad way.""The interview, which was meant to mark a fresh start in their public engagement, has instead raised questions about the couple’s relationship dynamics and their handling of media scrutiny. Branding it a “car crash,” Wootton commented on the failed attempt at damage control, noting the couple's awkward chemistry despite their united front.","Royal author Angela Levin claims that Meghan Markle was ""screaming"" and ""very annoyed"" after the CBS Sunday Morning interview.

US elections: Kamala Harris and Donald Trump to face off in prime-time debate on September 10,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-elections-kamala-harris-and-donald-trump-to-face-off-in-prime-time-debate-on-september-10/articleshow/112389058.cms,"Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are set to meet in a highly anticipated prime-time debate on September 10, as announced by ABC News on Thursday. This 90-minute showdown, expected to be held in Philadelphia, marks a pivotal moment in an unpredictable presidential campaign that has already seen significant twists and turns.The debate will be moderated by ABC anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis. Although the exact format and ground rules are still being finalized, it is likely that the event will proceed without a live audience, according to sources familiar with the plans.Notably, Trump had proposed three debates with major networks - September 4 with Fox News, September 10 with NBC, and September 25 with ABC. However, Harris has agreed to participate only in the September 10 debate with NBC. Harris has not yet provided reasons for declining the other proposed dates.This announcement follows Trump's initial agreement to debate President Joe Biden on the same date, an arrangement made months ago. However, after Biden's unexpected withdrawal from the race, Trump questioned the validity of that commitment with Harris, leading to uncertainty over whether the debate would take place.Recent events, including Biden's exit and an assassination attempt on Trump, have drawn renewed attention to the presidential race, which had initially been shaping up as a repeat of the 2020 election. The upcoming ABC debate is expected to serve as a critical moment in the campaign's final stretch leading up to the election.Trump has also indicated his willingness to engage in additional debates with Harris, proposing events hosted by NBC News and Fox News. However, the Harris campaign has not yet agreed to these additional debates. NBC News is reportedly in discussions with both campaigns about a potential debate on September 25, but Harris has not committed to participating. Similarly, no agreement has been reached for a debate hosted by Fox News.","The debate will be moderated by ABC anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis.

The system uses radar to track rockets while differentiating between the places that are densely populated or not. The radar-guided system then launches the interceptor missiles to destroy the threats mid-air accordingly. The system is placed across Israel, and every launcher is capable of firing 20 interceptor missiles in one go.Developed after a 2006 conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, who then launched thousands of rockets into Israel causing huge damage to the country and killing dozens of citizens.In response to this later Israel developed the most successful missile system with the support of the US. The system was developed by Israeli firms Rafael Advances Defense System and Israel Aerospace Industries.The system was first put into use in 2011 combat, the system counter-attacked a missile fired from the Gaza strip by Hamas. After a successful run in 2011 US announced to buy and test some Iron Dome batteries.Israel's military says the Iron Dome defence system has a success rate of up to 90 per cent. Hamas claimed it launched 5,000 rockets on the first day of its attack, but Israel estimates the number was closer to 2,500. The rockets were fired quickly to try to overwhelm Iron Dome, and some were also launched from Lebanon by Hezbollah.Since October 7, more than 8,000 rockets have been fired at Israel, according to the Israeli Defense Forces.

In a much-anticipated return to social media , former President Donald Trump shared harrowing details of an assassination attempt and pledged the largest deportation in US history during a live interview with Elon Musk on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. The conversation was marred by technical issues, frustrating many of Trump's supporters as the start was delayed by over 40 minutes.Trump recounted the near-fatal experience at a Pennsylvania rally, revealing how a bullet narrowly missed him.""If I had not turned my head, I would not be talking to you right now — as much as I like you,"" Trump told Musk.

Trump suggested that his strong relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin could have prevented the conflict, saying, ""I got along with Putin very well, and he respected me.""Reiterating his hardline stance on immigration, Trump promised the largest deportation in U.S. history if re-elected. He claimed that the number of illegal migrants has surged to an estimated “50-60 million people” from regions including Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.

Officials dismissed allegations of US interference on Monday, calling them ""simply false.""""We have had no involvement at all. Any reports or rumors that the United States government was involved in these events is simply false,"" White House spokesperson Jean-Pierre said during a press briefing when asked about the alleged US involvement.A report in the Economic Times on Sunday, stated, that Sheikh Hasina accused US of orchestrating her removal to gain control of Bangladesh's Saint Martin Island in the Bay of Bengal. According to the newspaper, Hasina allegedly communicated this claim through her close associates.Hasina's son, Sajeeb Wazed, countered these claims on X on Sunday, stating that his mother never made such allegations.""We believe that the Bangladeshi people should determine the future of the Bangladeshi government and that's where we stand,"" the White House added.An interim government in Bangladesh, led by Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus , was sworn in last Thursday with the objective of overseeing elections in the nation.Recent demonstrations and violence in Bangladesh stemmed from student protests against government job quotas favoring certain groups.These protests escalated into a broader campaign to remove Sheikh Hasina from power.Hasina had secured a fourth consecutive term in January in an election that was boycotted by the opposition and deemed not free and fair by the US State Department.Following her resignation, Hasina traveled to New Delhi, concluding her 15-year run as Bangladesh's prime minister.","The White House has denied any involvement in the recent ousting of Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.

""There appears to be a massive DDoS attack on X. Working on shutting it down,"" Musk posted. He also noted that if the situation could not be resolved quickly, the event would proceed with a smaller audience, with the full conversation being posted online later.Scheduled to take place on the social media platform X, the event had generated significant buzz due to the high-profile nature of both figures involved. However, as the livestream was set to start, users began reporting widespread issues with accessing the event, with many unable to connect or experiencing severe lag.Neither Trump nor Musk immediately commented on the issues, leaving their supporters and critics alike in suspense.The event had been promoted as an unscripted discussion with no limitations on topics, heightening the anticipation and the subsequent disappointment over the technical problems.Ahead of his anticipated conversation with Donald Trump, Elon Musk posted on X that the platform was conducting “some system scaling tests” to accommodate the expected high volume of participants. However, the tests failed to prevent issues, leaving many Trump supporters frustrated.“Not available????? I planned my whole day around this,” conservative commentator Glenn Beck wrote on X. Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman also voiced his displeasure, saying, “Please let Elon know we can’t join.”The interview's potential to stir controversy drew a cautionary response from Europe. Thierry Breton, the European Commissioner for the Internal Market, warned Musk of the risk of “amplification of harmful content” from broadcasting the Trump interview. In a letter posted on X, Breton urged Musk to ensure that X complies with the EU’s Digital Services Act, which addresses misinformation and other issues.In response, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung criticized the EU’s involvement, declaring, “The EU is an enemy of free speech and has no authority of any kind to dictate how we campaign.”Musk, who endorsed Trump two days after the former president was injured in an attempted assassination at a Pennsylvania rally last month, has shifted politically in recent years. Previously identifying as a Democrat, Musk has become increasingly aligned with right-leaning viewpoints on X, using the platform to influence political discourse globally.Musk’s controversial actions include reinstating banned accounts such as those of Alex Jones and Trump. Trump’s account was reinstated in November 2022 after Musk purchased the platform, though Trump had not actively used it until Monday. The former president preferred his Truth Social site, which he launched during his Twitter ban.Hours before the interview, Trump posted a video on his X account featuring highlights from his presidency and a campaign message asserting, “They’re not coming after me, they’re coming after you, and I just happen to be standing in their way, and I will never be moving.”Trump’s X account boasts 88 million followers, significantly more than his Truth Social following of 7.5 million. Musk’s account, which will host the interview, has over 193 million followers.The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to inquiries about cross-posting the interview on other platforms. Trump's recent X activity was limited to a photo of his mug shot from an Atlanta jail, related to charges involving attempts to overturn his election loss in Georgia.","The highly anticipated online conversation between Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk encountered technical difficulties just as it was about to begin on X (formerly Twitter) The platform is reportedly facing a massive Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack, causing significant disruptions during the event.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112480355,imgsize-2029813,width-400,resizemode-4/112480355.jpg"

And I think that’s what a normal person does,” Vance told CNN in an interview that aired Sunday.“Tim Walz gave his wife a name, firm midwestern handshake and then tried to sort of awkwardly correct for it,” he added.Donald Trump Jr. shared a clip of the interaction and said: “Totally normal to greet your wife with a firm handshake and a bro hug/back slap. Tim Walz isn't weird at all, guys.”The Ohio Senator said Harris and Walz, her running mate, ""aren't comfortable in their own skin"" and are attempting to persuade the American public that it is the Republicans who are peculiar.Vance believes that the handshake demonstrates Walz's attempt to divert attention from his own awkwardness by persistently labeling him as strange. “I think what it is, is two people, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, who aren't comfortable in their own skin, because they're uncomfortable with their policy positions for the American people,” Vance told CNN host Dana Bash on “State of the Union”.“And so they're name-calling instead of actually telling the American people how they're going to make their lives better,' he said.

Michael Waltz accuses Biden administration of ‘burying’ Iran’s threats against Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trying-to-kill-him-gop-rep-michael-waltz-accuses-biden-administration-of-burying-irans-threats-against-trump/articleshow/112475240.cms,"What documents have been leaked

‘Iran's motives for wanting Trump dead’

What US intelligence said

Rep. Michael Waltz (R-Fla.) accused the Biden administration of “burying” Iran ’s threats against GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump in the wake of the recent hacking attack on the Trump campaign and argued that the administration is sending the wrong message to Tehran.“These plots from Iran are ongoing. And when Biden says nothing, Harris says nothing, the DOJ tries to bury it, what message does Iran get? They get that we can keep trying to take Trump out and have no consequences,” Waltz told Fox News’.“They tried to hack his campaign or did hack his campaign this week.They’re trying to kill him. And we know from the intelligence community Iran doesn’t want Trump back,” he added.On Saturday, Trump's campaign confirmed that some of its internal communications had been hacked. This acknowledgment came after Politico began receiving emails from an anonymous source containing documents purportedly from inside Trump’s campaign operation. The Trump campaign attributed the breach to “foreign sources hostile to the United States,” referencing a recent Microsoft report.Earlier, on Friday, Microsoft disclosed that Iranian hackers had “sent a spear phishing email in June to a high-ranking official on a presidential campaign.” While Microsoft did not identify the specific campaign targeted and declined to comment further, the Trump campaign drew a connection between this incident and their own breach.Several news organisations, such as Politico and the Washington Post, claimed to have obtained Trump campaign materials that seemingly originated from the hack, The New York post reported.As per Politico, they received certain documents from “Robert” using an AOL email account. The documents consist of what appeared to be internal communications from a senior Trump campaign official. The report cited two people familiar with documents as saying that they are authentic. Additionally, Politico received a set of materials pertaining to Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who was rumored to be a top contender in the vice presidential selection process.Among the information provided to these outlets was a comprehensive 271-page document about JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee. The document appeared to be a compilation of publicly available information, intended to vet Vance and assess his potential vulnerabilities. The dossier was prepared by Brand Woodward, a law firm that provides services to several Trump advisers.Steven Cheung, a spokesperson for the Trump campaign said: “These documents were obtained illegally from foreign sources hostile to the United States, intended to interfere with the 2024 election and sow chaos throughout our democratic process.”Cheung further linked the timing of the breach with a Microsoft report that noted Iranian hackers had compromised an account of a “high-ranking official” on a US presidential campaign in June 2024, coinciding with the close timing of Trump’s selection of a vice-presidential nominee. However, Cheung did not disclose whether the campaign had been in contact with Microsoft or law enforcement about the breach, stating the campaign would not discuss such conversations.According to Waltz, who holds positions on the House Intelligence, Armed Services, and Foreign Affairs Committees and is rumored to be a potential candidate for a significant foreign policy role should Trump secure victory in the 2024 election, “You have multiple assassination plots from the Iranians. This Pakistani national was recruiting females as spotters. He had recruited hit men and had made a down payment. He was even recruiting protesters as a distraction.”“Yet, the Department of Justice, when they unveiled the indictment, didn’t even name Trump as the target. They tried to soft-pedal it and just say, oh, it was a politician. So this wasn’t an isolated incident in Butler, Pa,” he added.It is a widely held belief that Iran seeks retribution against Trump for his role in ordering the killing of Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani in 2020. The Trump administration claimed that Soleimani was “developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region,” The New York post reported.US officials have long maintained that Soleimani played a role in distributing improvised explosive devices responsible for the deaths and severe injuries of thousands of US soldiers during the Second Iraq War.Moreover, the strike occurred amidst a series of provocative actions taken by Iran in the region, some of which Trump did not retaliate against.Waltz argued that Iran's motives for wanting Trump dead are clear. “He held them accountable. And you overlay that with, how has Biden and Harris treated Iran? Well, Iran knows that they’re sympathizers,” he said.According to US intelligence officials , Iran has directed its propaganda efforts towards Trump. In 2021, a declassified assessment by the director of National Intelligence revealed that Iran targeted Trump during the 2020 election cycle, The New York post reported.The document stated: “We assess that Iran carried out a multi-pronged covert influence campaign intended to undercut former President Trump’s reelection prospects—though without directly promoting his rival,” adding that “We assess that Supreme Leader Khamenei authorized the campaign.”Tehran has officially denied the accusations of interfering in US elections.","On Saturday, Trump's campaign confirmed that some of its internal communications had been hacked.

Iran has accused Israel of the killing, although Israel has not claimed responsibility. The situation was further exacerbated by the death of Fuad Shukr, a senior military commander of Hezbollah, in an Israeli strike on Beirut.However, Iran has accused the US of complicity in Haniyeh's assassination due to its support for Israel.

Hameed has also been accused of multiple violations of the Pakistan Army Act after retirement.“Complying with the orders of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, a detailed court of inquiry was undertaken by the Pakistan Army to ascertain the correctness of complaints in the Top City (housing society) case made against Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd),” the military said in a statement.The management of Top City had accused the former ISI chief of orchestrating a raid on its offices and residence of its owner, Moeez Khan. As per the petition, filed in May 2017, Pakistan Rangers and ISI officials had taken away valuables, including gold and diamond ornaments and money, in connection with a purported terrorism case.Consequently, according to ISPR, appropriate disciplinary action has been initiated against Hameed under provisions of the Pakistan Army Act.“In addition, multiple instances of violation of Pakistan Army Act post-retirement have also been established,” the statement said.Hameed came into the global spotlight when he was filmed drinking tea in the lobby of a Kabul hotel shortly after the Taliban took over Afghanistan in 2021, forcing the former ruler, Ashraf Ghani, to flee.His transfer out of his ISI post had become a bone of contention between the former PM and the then army chief, Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa, which ultimately ended in Imran’s ouster from office in April 2022. Hameed had sought early retirement from the army in Nov 2022.Hameed was among the six senior-most army generals who were nominated by General HQ as a potential candidate for the two top military offices, chief of army staff (COAS) and chairman joint chiefs of staff committee (CJCSC).

Former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Faiz Hameed was arrested by Pakistan military in connection to a housing scheme scandal and the process for his court martial was initiated, the army said on Monday.It is for the first time in the country's history that court martial has been initiated against a former intelligence chief, according to Dawn .“Complying with the orders of Supreme Court of Pakistan, a detailed court of inquiry, was undertaken by Pakistan Army, to ascertain correctness of complaints in Top City case made against Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd),” a press statement by Pakistan army said further adding that ""the process of Field General Court Martial has been initiated and Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd) has been taken into military custody.”“Consequently, appropriate disciplinary action has been initiated against Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), under provisions of Pakistan Army Act,” the release further said.Hameed was regarded as close aide to Imran Khan, who appointed him to lead the ISI during his tenure as prime minister. Khan was removed from office in 2022 through a vote of no-confidence, which he claims was orchestrated by the military, though the military denies this allegation.In 2022, Hameed was one of the six senior-most generals whose names were forwarded by general headquarters to Pakistani prime minister Shehbaz Sharif for consideration for the two top military positions. He, however, chose to seek early retirement and submitted his resignation to the high command, as per sources.The Supreme Court, in its order dated November 14 last year, had said that the allegations against Hameed were of ""extremely serious nature"" and ""would undermine the reputation of the federal government, the armed forces, ISI and Pakistan Rangers, therefore, they cannot be left unattended.”This came after the management of Top City, a private housing scheme, made allegations against the former spy-master, accusing him of orchestrating a raid on the offices and residence of its owner, Moeez Khan.The petition was filed on May 12, 2017, and it said that Pakistan Rangers and ISI officials conducted a raid on Top City's office and Moeez’s residence, seizing valuables such as gold and diamond jewelry and money in connection with an alleged terrorism case, Dawn reported.It also alleged the involvement of former ISI officials Irtaza Haroon, Sardar Najaf, Wasim Tabish, Zahid Mehmood Malik, and Mohammad Munir ""in the illegal takeover of the housing society”.In March, a court placed retired naib tehsildar Najaf Hameed, Hameed's brother, under a 14-day judicial remand.Najaf and other co-accused had sought pre-arrest bail in an FIR filed with the Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) in Rawalpindi.The FIR alleged that former minister for mineral resources Hafiz Ammar Yasir had acquired properties worth billions of rupees through intermediaries.In April, the military had reportedly established an inquiry committee to investigate allegations of authority misuse involving the former ISI head.","Former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Faiz Hameed was arrested by Pakistan military in connection to a housing scheme scandal.

Pakistani authorities have increased scrutiny at international airports over tremendous rise in the number of beggars travelling to middle eastern countries disguised as tourists , Dawn reported.This came after a senior official informed the Senate Standing Committee on Overseas Pakistanis that 90% of beggars detained abroad are of Pakistani origin.Potential beggars were disguising themselves as tourists to travel to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Iran, Oman, and Turkey, a senior official from Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) told Dawn.The official informed the news website that, in recent months, immigration staff at airports have removed several passengers from flights in an effort to curb this trend.Earlier this year, the interior ministry had reported that it deported 44,000 passengers based on similar suspicions over the past two and a half years.A senior FIA officer suggested that these countries should also review their visa processing systems, rather than solely urging Pakistani authorities to prevent potential beggars, criminals, and illegal immigrants.Meanwhile, UAE authorities have begun actively rejecting visa applications from Pakistanis who cannot demonstrate sufficient funds in their accounts to be considered ""genuine visitors.""","90% of beggars detained abroad are of Pakistani origin, official says.

Polio is transmitted through contaminated water or food, or contact with an infected person. Treatment includes bed rest, pain relievers, rehabilitation and portable ventilators.Dr Hamid Jafari, WHO 's regional director of polio eradication was cited by Al-Jazeera as saying that the challenge exists in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. ""This is where there's a lot of militancy, insecurity and community hostility and frustration towards the government because of conflict and a lack of services,"" Jafari said.Over 50 districts across Pakistan are detecting the virus, he said.Compounding to the challenges is the fact, says the WHO official that not only is the polio programme being targeted but also security personnel that are guarding the teams ""because they become soft targets when they are in the community.""At least 102 polio field workers, officials and security personnel have been killed, including at least six in campaigns carried out this year, the Al Jazeera report cited.Meanwhile, the latest victim is an 11-month-old infant from Qila, in Balochistan who has succumbed to paralysis caused by the wild poliovirus.The child from Qila who displayed symptoms of paralysis on July 17, is among the five cases detected in the district. Other cases in Balochistan have been reported in Chaman, Quetta, Zhob, Dera Bugti, and Jhal Magsi as per a report in the Balochistan Post.In Balochistan, the situation is compounded by a recent history of inadequate vaccination coverage and persistent misconceptions about the vaccine. Despite numerous vaccination campaigns, efforts have struggled to keep pace with the actual number of infections, the publication stated.","On August 10, the 14th polio case of the year was reported from Qilla Saifullah district of Balochistan boosting the number of poliovirus cases in the country to 13 for the year 2024.
