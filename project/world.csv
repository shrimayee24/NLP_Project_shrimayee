NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Sunday voiced concern over the arrest of former Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe, describing the charges against him as “trivial” and urging Colombo to refrain from the""politics of vengeance. ”“Concerned about the detention of former Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe on what, on the face of it, seem trivial charges. His health issues have already seen him taken to the prison hospital,” Tharoor, a former diplomat, wrote on X while sharing an old photograph with the Sri Lankan leader.“I call on the government of Sri Lanka — while fully respecting that this is their internal matter — to abjure the politics of vengeance and treat their former President with the respect and dignity that he deserves, after his decades of service to the nation,” he added.The 76-year-old Sri Lankan politician was arrested on Friday on allegations of state funds' misuse, as reported by Newswire Lanka.His arrest is linked to allegations of using state funds to cover the expenses for a private visit to London, where he had attended a university graduation ceremony.Investigators allege that the trip, which formed part of a wider overseas tour, was not an official engagement but was financed with government money.Wickremesinghe, who also served as the island nation's prime minister, assumed office as its interim president in July 2022 following Gotabaya Rajapaksa's removal. He lost the presidential elections to Anura Kumara Dissanayake, the leader of National People's Power, in September 2024.",Congress MP Shashi Tharoor voiced concern over the arrest of former Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe.

KOLKATA: A four-year-old boy headed to Malaysia for a holiday with his family on Aug 12 was attacked by a Customs dog at Kolkata airport resulting in deep scratches on his back and leading to his hospitalisation. The family had to scuttle its trip and on Aug 19 lodged an FIR with NSCBI airport police station against the dog handler.The child, Anav Jain, is now undergoing a treatment protocol that requires five doses of immunisation administered over 28 days.The dog, a four-year-old female Alsatian named Nancy, was trained for narcotics detection at the Customs Canine Centre at Attari, airport sources said.

""The airport doctor downplayed the severity of the dog bite, when it was evident that my child required immediate medical attention,"" the FIR said. He added that the family's request for CCTV footage was denied.Bidhannagar cops said they have registered an FIR against the handler under a BNS section punishable by six months in jail or a fine of Rs 500, or both.Airport authorities said they are investigating the claims.Jain said they took Anav to a private hospital in New Town, where he underwent overnight treatment and follow-ups for a week. The child's uncle, Roshan, said the family entered the airport together for their Malaysia and Singapore trip. ""Anav was so happy and we clicked his photo. Moments later, he was attacked by the dog.

"Administration cancels land lease of Sonam Wangchuk’s HIAL, activist terms it ‘attack on Ladakh’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/administration-cancels-land-lease-of-sonam-wangchuks-hial-activist-terms-it-attack-on-ladakh/articleshow/123477350.cms,"SRINAGAR: The Ladakh administration ’s move to cancel the land allotment of Himalayan Institute of Alternative Learning (HIAL), founded by environmental activist Sonam Wangchuk , has led to sharp criticism from the region’s two biggest political movements --- Leh Apex Body (LAB) and Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA).“We believe this is a witch hunt. It seems like a conspiracy to harass and intimidate people,” LAB representatives said at a press conference in Leh. “Sonam Wangchuk is very vocal about the rights of the people of Ladakh at national and international level. We see this as an attempt to silence the voices of Ladakh one by one. But we will not be scared. All leadership stands with him.”Wangchuk, on his part, termed the administration’s move as an attack on Ladakh itself. “It is not an attack on Sonam Wangchuk, but on Ladakh. It is an attack on the Leh Apex Body and the Kargil Democratic Alliance,” he said.LAB and KDA, formed in 2020, represent political and religious groups from Leh and Kargil. Both have been demanding statehood for Ladakh and inclusion of the region under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution.Since the abrogation of Article 370 on Aug 5, 2019, and the bifurcation of the J&K state into the two UTs — J&K and Ladakh — the Ladakh region has witnessed a series of political agitations for the Sixth Schedule and statehood.Wangchuk has led several such protests, holding long fasts and long marches.On Jan 2, 2023, the ministry of home affairs set up a high-powered committee to address key issues in Ladakh, including the Sixth Schedule. The last round of talks, between the Centre’s high-powered committee and the Ladakhi leaders was held on May 27, leading to the introduction of a domicile policy.On Aug 11, LAB and KDA launched a three-day protest in Kargil, led by Wangchuk, demanding statehood and Sixth Schedule status for Ladakh.On Aug 21, Leh deputy commissioner Romil Singh Donk issued an order stating that the land measuring 1,076 kanal and 1 marla (over 53.8 hectares) allotted to HIAL “stands escheated to the State, i.e., LAHDC (Leh Autonomous Hill Development Council)”, and directed the Leh tehsildar to “remove all the encumbrances from the said piece of state land as per provisions of the law, and effect entries in the revenue record accordingly”.The order said the land in Phyang was given to HIAL on lease for 40 years, but it has not been used for the purpose allotted, “as no university (as recognised by law) has been set up” to date.Wangchuk, while talking to reporters, said HIAL was created in 2018 with the support of Ladakh leaders after the success of the “ice stupa” project, which was aimed at addressing Ladakh’s water crisis. “The land was leased to the HIAL under unanimous consensus of Ladakhi leaders. It is a charitable company, not my personal university,” Wangchuk said. “The allotment was given in 2018, and now, suddenly, the Ladakh administration says it is not serving its purpose. ”He said 400 students have passed out from HIAL. “The cancellation of the land lease at this juncture, when Ladakhi leaders are seeking safeguards for the region, shows a design. HIAL is the pride of not just Ladakh but of the whole Himalayas,” he added.",Ladakh administration cancels land allotment of Himalayan Institute of Alternative Learning. Move has led to sharp criticism from the region’s two biggest political movements.

The relentless downpour has prompted swift action from the Army and the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), who have been actively conducting relief operations in Kota.Meanwhile, the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) has been evacuating residents from other severely affected areas, ensuring their safety amidst the rising waters.In a bid to assess the extent of the damage and coordinate further relief efforts, Disaster Relief Minister Kirodi Meena, accompanied by Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, is set to conduct an aerial survey of the affected regions in the Kota division on Saturday.Their visit underscores the gravity of the situation and the government's commitment to addressing the crisis. The Meteorological Department has reported that Bundi's Nainwa received an unprecedented 502 mm of rainfall in the past 24 hours, marking it as the highest in the region.This deluge has led to significant waterlogging in several districts, including Bundi, Kota, Sawai Madhopur, Karauli, and Jaipur, with rainfall exceeding 10 cm by Saturday morning. In response to the ongoing threat, a red alert has been issued for Bhilwara and Chittorgarh, warning of extremely heavy rainfall, while an orange alert remains in place for Bundi, Kota, Pali, Rajsamand, Udaipur, Dungarpur, Banswara, Jalore, and Sirohi.In Tonk district, the SDRF and civil defense teams have successfully rescued over 100 individuals from a village in Niwai’s Banasthali, which was submerged under water. District officials, including Collector Kalpana Agrawal and SP Rajesh Meena, have been on the ground, assessing the situation and coordinating relief efforts.","A 200-foot-long wall collapsed in Amer Fort in Jaipur on Saturday amid heavy rains in the city, according to the video shared by PTI news agency.

J&K High Court Orders Modi Govt To Bring Back Woman Deported To Pakistan After Pahalgam Attack

SRINAGAR: A day after ordering the takeover of schools allegedly run by the banned Jamaat-e-Islami’s (JeI) educational organisation, Falah-e-Aam Trust (FAT), Jammu and Kashmir government moved swiftly on Saturday to enforce the directive despite opposition from all political parties, except BJP. A senior official said the principals of nearby government schools, backed by police and revenue staff, asserted administrative authority in all 215 JeI-linked schools across Kashmir.On Friday evening, J&K education secretary stated in its order directing the takeover that 215 schools had been identified by “intelligence agencies” that were “found to be directly or indirectly affiliated with proscribed organisation Jamaat-e-Islami (Jel)”.Former chief minister and PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti condemned the decision, saying Kashmiris voted the National Conference (NC) to office in the 2024 assembly elections to safeguard their interests, but the party has instead targeted schools that provided quality education in J&K.Her daughter Iltija Mufti said every time NC got a brute majority in J&K, their first target has always been the Jamaat-e-Islami. “Be it 1977 or even today, where they have taken it too far by jeopardising the future of thousands of students, leaving them in distress,” she said.Education minister Sakina Itoo defended the decision, saying the state had not taken over the schools but directed principals of nearby govt schools to “look after” them for three months, after which the order would be reviewed. She said her proposal was altered by the administrative secretary, who inserted “deputy commissioner” and “take over” in the order instead of “nearest principal” and “look after.” The order would be corrected, she said.Administrative secretary Ram Niwas Sharma did not respond to calls for comment.I too stressed that the decision was taken to safeguard the interests of the students and teachers. Intelligence agencies had given an adverse report on these schools eight years ago, leading to their deregistration. The latest order, she said, was meant to ensure that 55,000 students of these schools continue their education and teachers remain employed.Rejecting the criticism of political opponents, she said: “Where were they all these eight years when students and teachers of these schools were suffering because of deregistration?”Responding to the minister’s statement, PDP legislator Waheed Parra challenged her to “come clean and make her original proposal public for everyone to see”. Peoples Conference, Apni Party and Awami Ittehad Party also condemned the govt move.BJP, however, welcomed the decision to assume control of Jamaat schools. Altaf Thakur, the party’s J&K spokesman, called it a “much-needed intervention to ensure that young minds are shielded from separatist narratives”. It was “a bold decision”, Thakur said, alleging that these schools were a source of “separatism and terrorism” in J&K.The central govt had banned JeI in Feb 2019 under UAPA and declared it an unlawful association. Since then, authorities have carried out several crackdowns against the group.However, in last year’s assembly elections in J&K, several candidates affiliated with JeI contested under the banner of the Justice and Development Front (JDF), indicating the group’s return to electoral politics after a 35-year poll boycott. The JDF has now aligned with Sajad Lone’s Peoples Conference.","Jammu and Kashmir government moved swiftly on Saturday to enforce the directive despite opposition from all political parties, except BJP.

NEW DELHI: A giant effigy of US President Donald Trump was carried out at the centuries-old Marbat Utsav in Nagpur, as locals symbolically protested the US government’s recent 50% tariff on Indian goods.Alongside the giant effigy, several placards carried protest messages such as: “By imposing tariffs to intimidate us, they end up regretting India’s strength,"" “The tariffs imposed on our goods will only ruin their business” and “American uncle imposes restrictions on India, yet ends up taking Russian products itself.”The Marbat festival, celebrated annually in Nagpur on the second day of Pola, blends tradition, culture and social commentary.Originating in the 19th century, the festival was initially intended to ward off evil spirits, with clay and hay effigies known as “Marbats” that represented negative forces or societal evils. Over time, the event has evolved into a platform for expressing public sentiment on contemporary social and political issues.This year, the Trump effigy was carried, reflecting public displeasure over the tariff imposed by the US.On August 6, President Trump signed an executive order adding a 25% tariff on Indian goods to the existing 25% rate, citing India’s continued purchase of Russian oil, a significant funding source for Moscow’s war in Ukraine.The festival processions, vibrant music and ritualistic burning or immersion of effigies offered residents a means to voice their discontent while maintaining the cultural essence of Marbat Utsav. Traditionally, the effigies symbolize corruption, injustice or social evils, according to the website of Maharashtra tourism.","A giant effigy of US President Donald Trump was carried out at the centuries-old Marbat Utsav in Nagpur. locals symbolically protested the US government’s recent 50% tariff on Indian goods.

"There can't be any compromise on trade red lines, says Jaishankar",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/there-cant-be-any-compromise-on-trade-red-lines-says-jaishankar/articleshow/123477720.cms,"NEW DELHI: Foreign minister S Jaishankar flagged trade, India-Pakistan mediation and the controversy over India's purchase of oil from Russia as three issues that have complicated the relationship with the US. The minister ruled out any compromise on the red lines drawn by India in trade negotiations and on mediation while underscoring India's position on oil that such decisions are about upholding national interest and strategic autonomy.The discussions for a bilateral trade deal could not take place as the US delegation called off its visit, but the minister said ""negotiations are still going on in the sense that nobody has said the negotiations are off"". ""People do talk to each other. It's not like there's a complete cut,"" he said, speaking at the ET World Leaders Forum. Asked about US charge that India is profiteering from Russian oil, Jaishankar said it's funny to have people who work for a pro-business American administration accusing other people of doing business. tnnThat's (US allegations that India is profiteering from Russian oil) really curious. But here's the point: if you have a problem buying oil from India - oil or refined products - don't buy it.Nobody forces you to buy it. What Europe buys, America buys. If you don't like it, don't buy it, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said.""So, when it comes to trade and the interests of farmers, when it comes to our strategic autonomy, when it comes to opposition to mediation, this govt is very clear. If anybody disagrees with us, please tell the people of India that you're not prepared to defend the interests of farmers. Please tell the people of India you don't value autonomy. We will do whatever we have to do to maintain it,"" he said, adding that the red lines are primarily the interests of India's farmers, and to some extent small producers.On improvement in ties with China, he said India always maintained that if the border is stable, predictable, and free of incidents, there is a natural improvement in rest of the relationship. ""The border has been stable for some time now, & as disengagement was completed, it was logical that there would be improvement in other areas... it's not a great U-turn where everything is fine now,"" he said.""For our farmers, a predictable flow of fertilisers is important. For those in infrastructure, getting machinery from China is important. For our auto industry, an uninterrupted flow of magnets is important. These are legitimate issues of our industry. We should take them up with China and address them for the businesses and workers of India,"" he said.Reiterating India's position that it helped stabilise oil prices when there was a great deal of nervousness about them, Jaishankar said there was a series of very explicit conversations with the Biden administration saying US had no issues with India's buying.","Foreign minister S Jaishankar flagged trade, India-Pakistan mediation and the controversy over India's purchase of oil from Russia as three issues that have complicated the relationship with the US.

PATNA: Diwakar Sharma remembers the past two elections clearly. His wife Deepti voted both times without trouble. Now her name has disappeared from the electoral roll, and the couple has just a week to prove she still belongs.Across Bihar, thousands are scrambling to reclaim their place on the rolls before the Sept 1 deadline - a race against time that began when SC Friday opened a narrow window for those struck off during the SIR. Voters can now submit Aadhaar or one of 11 other approved documents, even online, to restore their names. The urgency is palpable in Ara, Bhojpur, Bettiah - wherever one goes.""The BLO (booth-level officer) told me what SC has just said, but he's waiting for written orders,"" Sharma, a 35-year-old priest in West Champaran, told TOI on Saturday.On paper, the ruling offers relief. On the ground, confusion is choking the process. Many deleted voters live in remote areas with limited internet access. BLOs, the backbone of the enrolment system, said they are yet to receive ""formal instructions"" on how to act. ""We cannot consider Aadhaar until EC issues an official order,"" said a BLO from East Champaran.Suchitra Sinha, a BLO from Bhojpur, warned that the timeline is too short.""Poll authorities should extend the deadline. It is difficult to collect Aadhaar from all excluded people within a week,"" she said. Without written orders from the chief electoral officer or district officials, BLOs fear their decisions could be challenged later.Frustration runs deep over political apathy, too. Electoral rules expect parties to deputise booth-level agents to help identify excluded voters and file claims. BLOs said support is scarce.""Hardly any BLAs are taking interest in submitting forms. Some are not even aware they have been appointed,"" said M Safir Ali, a BLO in Ara. Another BLO in Ara's Babu Bazar accused parties of ""raising noise but offering no assistance"".Politicians pushed back. ""Our party submitted nine claim forms in Bhojpur district alone till Aug 23 and has been consistently drawing attention to deletions,"" said CPI(ML)'s Chandan Kumar, an aide to Ara MP Sudama Prasad. Jan Suraaj's Ashok Manav said workers were assisting in all 14 blocks, but argued it was ""the prime responsibility of election officials to ensure not a single eligible voter is disenfranchised"".The scale of deletions is staggering. West Champaran saw 1,91,376 names removed, slashing the voter count to 25,69,614 from 27,60,990. Officials say 70,000 voters had shifted residences, while 20,000 names were duplicates.For people like Sharma and trader Dhananjay Soni in Valmikinagar, whose wife Ranjana also vanished from the rolls, the SC ruling has brought hope - but little clarity.

Judge seals court filing after Janel Grant’s medical records mistakenly surface amid legal battle with Dr. Carlon Colker,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/judge-seals-court-filing-after-janel-grants-medical-records-mistakenly-surface-amid-legal-battle-with-dr-carlon-colker/articleshow/123444175.cms,"Dr. Carlon Colker and Janel Grant.

Filing error prompted judges' reaction in Janel Grant’s high-profile legal fight



The recent leak has broader implications in the Vince McMahon-linked lawsuit



The federal court dispute involving former WWE employee Janel Grant and physician Dr. Carlon Colker escalated this week after sensitive medical records appeared publicly online. The unredacted filing, briefly accessible on the federal docket Tuesday night, prompted swift intervention. By Wednesday, Judge Sarah F. Russell ordered the document sealed, citing the exposure of both Grant’s birth date and her confidential medical history. Although a redacted version followed, the private information had already been available to the public.The filing in question came from Dr. Carlon Colker’s legal team as part of his defamation lawsuit against Janel Grant’s attorney, Ann Callis. Colker claims Callis and her firm damaged his reputation with false statements about his treatment of Grant, who has separately accused Vince McMahon and WWE of trafficking and abuse. Grant alleges McMahon directed her to Colker’s Peak Wellness clinic, where she was given unnamed pills and intravenous treatments without clarity about their nature. Colker denies wrongdoing and stresses that he is not a defendant in the federal trafficking suit (per Brandon Thurston of Post Wrestling).To bolster their defamation claims, Colker’s attorneys included excerpts of Grant’s medical records in their brief. That decision quickly backfired. Judge Russell noted the document contained prohibited details: “a non-party’s [Grant’s] birth date” and “medical records that are the subject of an unopposed Motion to Seal.”In her order, she explained, “Given these circumstances, the court finds clear and compelling reasons to seal [Colker’s] response pending the filing of a redacted response. ”On Wednesday, Colker’s team submitted an updated version with the sensitive portions blacked out. So far, neither Colker’s counsel nor Grant’s representatives commented publicly.This courtroom mishap is only one thread in a wider legal web. Colker, represented by attorney Alejandro Brito, who also handles defamation cases for President Donald Trump, argues that Callis acted with “actual malice,” the legal threshold for defamation involving public figures. At the same time, his filings suggest he may challenge that classification, contending he is a private individual, which would lower the burden of proof.Carlon Colker’s team doubled down in their brief, insisting “even a cursory review of the medical records supports the notion of patient-initiated, informed, and consented treatments of Grant.” Callis, however, has maintained her statements were grounded in Grant’s own accounts and conditions.Also Read: Trish Stratus shares heartbreaking message as she announces her mother’s passing following long fight with cancer The dispute comes against the backdrop of Grant’s broader case against Vince McMahon and WWE, which alleges years of abuse and trafficking. Grant’s legal team has described lawsuits like Colker’s and delays in accessing her medical files as forms of retaliation. In Connecticut, Grant is also suing Colker and Peak Wellness to secure more records and communications that could shed light on her treatment and connections to McMahon.","Filing error prompted judges' reaction in Janel Grant’s high-profile legal fight.

Harjinder Singh's accident, major visa fallout







A signature-collection petition in support of Harjinder Singh , the truck driver who killed three people in a crash in Florida, is at the center of a fresh row as social media users ask how they were allowed to start a petition in support of the Indian-origin man who was residing in the US illegally.The petition was started by Manisha Kaushal under the name of 'Collective Punjabi youth' which argued that Harjinder Singh did not have any criminal intent or history. The incident in which three people died because Singh took a wrong U-turn was a catastrophe and not a criminal act, the petition said.""The driver has no prior record and fully cooperated with authorities...The imposed 45-year sentence is excessively severe given the nature of the accident,"" the petition said.The petition urged for reduction the current sentence, grant parole eligibility after Harjinder serves a reduced term, and considering alternative sentencing options.The Florida accident had a major repercussion as the State Department paused issuing worker visas for commercial truck drivers. ""The increasing number of foreign drivers operating large tractor-trailer trucks on US roads is endangering American lives and undercutting the livelihoods of American truckers,"" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said.After the road crash, it was found out that Singh entered US illegally and got his driver's license in Democrat-controlled California. Donald Trump administration blamed the California government for issuing license to illegal aliens while California Governor Gavin Newsom's office claimed Singh entered the country illegally in 2018 during the Trump administration. The to-and-fro continued as the Trump administration said his work permit was granted by the Biden administration, even after it was canceled by the Trump administration.Singh fled to California after the incident. He was brought back to Florida, where he now faces charges and then deportation.","A petition has been started to reduce truck driver Harjinder Singh's sentencing.

The US Justice Department on Friday released hours of interviews with Ghislaine Maxwell - the convicted accomplice of Jeffrey Epstein , in which she denied claims linking prominent political figures to Epstein’s alleged sex crimes.Speaking to Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche inside a federal prison in Tallahassee, Maxwell insisted she had never witnessed US President Donald Trump “doing anything inappropriate with anybody.” She said the president ""seemed friendly"" with Epstein, but added that she only recalled seeing the two together in ""social settings"" and not in ""private settings"".""I never witnessed the President in any inappropriate setting in any way. The President was never inappropriate with anybody. In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects"", she said.She also rejected suggestions that former President Bill Clinton had visited Epstein’s private island in the US Virgin Islands, saying the Clintons were “her friends, not Epstein’s.”Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, acknowledged Epstein’s criminal conduct but distanced herself from any responsibility.“I do believe that Epstein did a lot of, not all, but some of what he’s accused of, and I’m not here to defend him in any respect whatsoever,” she said, adding that he did not deserve “any type of protection” from her.The Justice Department made public hundreds of pages of transcripts and audio from the interviews on Friday, which were conducted under terms that gave Maxwell limited immunity from further prosecution unless she provided false statements.Maxwell also dismissed long-running speculation about Epstein maintaining a secret “client list” or stockpiling compromising material on powerful associates. “There was no blackmail operation,” she told investigators.","Ghislaine Maxwell is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking.

KOLKATA: A 79-year-old woman was found murdered, her hands and feet tied, in her bungalow inside New Garia Cooperative Society on Friday morning while her 83-year-old husband was found tied up in a bedroom on the ground floor. Electrical wires, including those connecting CCTV cameras and the doorbell, were found severed.Bijaya and Prasanta Das were the only inmates of the two-storey house. Their son lives in Mumbai and their daughter in Germany.Joint CP (crime & traffic) Rupesh Kumar said the couple's maid, Madhumita Haldar, arrived at the house around 5.45 am and rang the bell. When none opened the door, she called out to the couple. On getting no response, she went to the rear entrance and found the door latched from outside.She entered the house and found Bijaya lying unresponsive near the staircase with multiple injuries on her head and face. She raised an alarm and informed the couple's son. Police arrived around 6.25 am. Prasanta was found lying on the floor next to his bed in an adjacent room. Cops said he was in a state of absolute shock. He was administered saline and removed to a relative's residence. Till evening, he could not be questioned.Prima facie, cops said, all ornaments worn by the victim are missing. Police are waiting for her children and relatives to ascertain if anything else is missing from the house.""It seems financial gain was the motive. It could be a property-related murder too. We have come to know that the elderly couple was ill recently and needed hospitalisation and their children had arranged for a large amount to pay for their medical expenses. We need to ascertain if that money was the target,"" said an investigating officer.The couple was largely confined to their home and had hired a caregiver for Prasanta on Aug 17.

Cops are eager to question Prasanta and his caregiver at the earliest.The investigators are exploring whether the assailants had prior access to the home or if the CCTV system was disabled from outside. The rear door of the house was found open, raising suspicions that the assailants may have gained access through that door.","Bijaya and Prasanta Das were the only inmates of the two-storey house.

‘Several countries’: Iran says it has built weapon factories abroad; missile development ‘a priority’ says defence minister,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/several-countries-iran-says-it-has-built-weapon-factories-abroad-missile-development-a-priority-says-defence-minister/articleshow/123479693.cms,"Image: X@/iranmilitaryeng





Iran’s defence minister, Aziz Nasirzadeh, has said in a televised interview that Tehran has built infrastructure to produce weapons in “several countries”, though he did not disclose the names of the nations involved.The remarks come amid heightened tensions triggered by Israeli and US strikes against Iran earlier this summer.Nasirzadeh stated that “missile development” has been a priority, and the “priorities may change” after the war with Israel. He also noted that the factories “will likely be officially opened and announced in the near future,” reported the Times of Israel.Tehran has also tested “new warheads in the past year that are both advanced and maneuverable,” Nasirzadeh said.His comments coincided with Iran’s navy test-firing cruise missiles at surface targets in the Gulf of Oman and the northern Indian Ocean during major exercises on Thursday. The drills came a month after the Casarex 2025 joint exercises with Russia in the Caspian Sea.Nasirzadeh also claimed that if the conflict in June lasted 15 days, Israeli forces would have been unable to intercept Iranian missiles.“If the war had gone 15 days, in the last three days the Israelis would not have been able to hit any of our missiles,” he said, adding that the country did not use its “most precise weapon” the Qassem Basir missile, as cited by Iran International.“In the early days, about 40% of our missiles were intercepted, but by the end of the war, 90% were striking their targets,” Nasirzadeh said. “This showed that our experience was growing while the defensive power of the other side was decreasing.”The Iran-Israel war broke out after Israeli strikes on June 13 killed senior Iranian commanders, nuclear scientists, and damaged key defence and nuclear facilities. Iran reported 1,062 deaths, including 786 military personnel and 276 civilians. Its retaliatory missile and drone attacks killed 32 people in Israel. The conflict ended with a US-brokered ceasefire on June 24.Earlier this month, a senior military adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, cautioned that a new war involving the United States or Israel could break out at any moment, emphasising that the current situation does not amount to a ceasefire but a war.“We are not in a ceasefire, we are in a stage of war. No protocol, regulation or agreement has been written between us and the US or Israel,” said Yahya Safavi, a top aide of Khamenei and former commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), told local media, as cited by the Times of Israel.",Iran's defence minister says Tehran has built infrastructure to produce weapons in'several countries' Aziz Nasirzadeh did not disclose the names of the nations involved.

Maryland deportation case: Wrongfully deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia released from jail; future still uncertain as DHS vows action,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/maryland-deportation-case-wrongfully-deported-kilmar-abrego-garcia-released-from-jail-deportation-still-possible-as-dhs-vows-action/articleshow/123463820.cms,"Kilmar Abrego Garcia (center) leaves the Putnam County Jail in Cookeville, Tennessee.

Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national whose wrongful deportation earlier this year became a flashpoint in US President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, was released Friday from a Tennessee jail to rejoin his family in Maryland while awaiting trial on human smuggling charges.Abrego Garcia, 30, was mistakenly deported in March despite a 2019 immigration court ruling that barred his return to El Salvador because of a “well-founded fear” of gang violence.He was sent to a notorious maximum-security prison before being flown back to the US in June under a court order. Within days of his return, he was arrested and charged with transporting undocumented migrants.On Friday, Abrego Garcia walked out of the Putnam County jail dressed in jeans and a white button-down short-sleeved shirt alongside his lawyer, Rascoe Dean. He did not speak to reporters and departed swiftly in a waiting SUV, as per news agency AP.His release order requires him to travel directly to Maryland, where he will live under home detention with his brother designated as custodian, and submit to electronic monitoring. He’ll be able to leave home only for approved activities.Defense attorney Sean Hecker said his client had been “unlawfully arrested and deported, and then imprisoned, all because of the government’s vindictive attack on a man who had the courage to fight back”, according to news agency AFP.Another attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, noted that Abrego Garcia had been reunited with his family for the first time since March but warned he was “far from safe,” citing the risk of deportation to a third country.The department of homeland security has signalled plans to remove him to an unnamed nation, with options such as Uganda, Mexico, or South Sudan under discussion, news agency Reuters reported. A Maryland judge has ordered that his lawyers be given 72 hours’ notice before any such deportation so they can challenge it.Abrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty to smuggling charges linked to a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop where officers found nine passengers in his car but released him with only a warning. His trial is set for January 2027.Trump administration officials have strongly condemned his release. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem branded him a “monster” and vowed, “We will not stop fighting till this Salvadoran man faces justice and is OUT of our country”.Deputy press secretary Abigail Jackson also described him as a “criminal illegal alien” and MS-13 member, calling his release an “insult to his victims”.Despite the political firestorm, Abrego Garcia remains under court protection. Maryland Governor Wes Moore said the case underscored the principle that “every person is afforded their right to due process” in the US.","Kilmar Abrego Garcia, 30, was mistakenly deported in March despite a 2019 immigration court ruling that barred his return to El Salvador.

(Picture credit: AP)





Lyle Menendez, one of the two brothers convicted of murdering their wealthy parents in Beverly Hills more than three decades ago, has been denied parole by a California state panel.The 57-year-old, who uses his middle name Joseph, appeared by video from a San Diego prison on Friday for his first parole hearing since being resentenced earlier this year.After an 11-hour closed-door session, commissioners decided he must remain behind bars for at least three more years, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.“Joseph (Lyle) Menendez was denied parole for three years at his initial suitability hearing today,” the department said in a statement, as cited by news agency AFP.The ruling follows Thursday’s decision in the case of his younger brother, Erik, 54, whose parole was also rejected.The siblings, convicted in 1996 of killing Jose and Kitty Menendez with shotguns in 1989, were originally sentenced to life without parole. A Los Angeles judge reduced those terms in May to 50 years to life, making them eligible for release as they were under 26 at the time of the crime, as per news agency AP.The Menendez case first shocked America in 1989, when Lyle, then 21, and Erik, 18, killed their parents inside their Beverly Hills mansion. They initially told investigators it was linked to their father’s business or the Mafia, but two months later Erik confessed to a psychologist that he and his brother were responsible.The brothers were arrested in 1990 and later charged with first-degree murder. Prosecutors said the motive was greed, while the defence argued they acted after years of sexual and emotional abuse, as per AP.Their first trials in the early 1990s ended with hung juries, but in 1995 they were convicted of murder, along with lying in wait and special circumstances allegations. They were sentenced the following year to life without parole. For decades, appeals were denied by state and federal courts.While in prison, the brothers engaged in education, led self-help classes, and even launched a prison beautification project inspired by Norway’s rehabilitation model, according to AP. Their case has also drawn renewed public attention through true-crime shows, including Netflix’s nine-episode series Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story.As per The New York Times, Friday’s hearing was Lyle’s first chance at release, though parole boards rarely grant freedom at an initial review. Both brothers will be eligible for new hearings in three years but could also pursue clemency from California Governor Gavin Newsom or continue legal challenges.According to AP, the parole board weighs whether inmates pose an “unreasonable risk of danger to society” if freed, considering their criminal history, motivation, remorse, behaviour in prison and reentry plans.Nearly all of the Menendez family members have backed their release; their uncle Milton Andersen, one of the few who opposed it, died earlier this year.Though formally denied parole for three years, the brothers may be reviewed sooner, with administrative reconsideration possible within a year and another hearing in as little as 18 months.They also still have a pending habeas corpus petition, filed in May 2023, that seeks to reopen their convictions based on new evidence supporting their claims of sexual abuse by their father.","Lyle Menendez, 57, and his brother Erik, 54, were convicted of murdering their parents in Beverly Hills in 1989.

No client list but Epstein might not have committed suicide







In a major curtain-down moment for the ongoing Epstein case, the Justice Department released the full transcripts of the audio of Ghislaine Maxwell 's interview in which Maxwell said Epstein never had any client list ever and President Donald Trump did not do anything inappropriate with anybody when he was friends with pedophile Epstein.Maxwell is the only key person in the Epstein case and Maxwell was the disgraced financer's aide, girlfriend and was a party in many cases of sexual exploitation. After the DOJ and the FBI closed the Epstein case and said there was no foul play in Epstein's death, Maxwell who is serving her sentence claimed that her side of the story was never heard.Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche sat down with Maxwell in a federal prison in Tallahassee, where she was being held until recently. The terms of the interview granted her limited immunity from further prosecution – unless she told lies.Authorities published hundreds of pages of transcripts as well as audio recordings of the interview on the DOJ website.Epstein was found dead in his prison cell in 2019. Conspiracy theorists love to believe that he was murdered in his cell because he was blackmailing people that he would disclose their names and their association with his child sex racket. With his death, the two issues remained mysteries: how he died and who are named on Epstein's list. After DOJ and FBI, Maxwell also claimed that Epstein did not maintain a client list. But Maxwell reiterated her past statements that she does not believe Epstein killed himself. She also said Epstein told her he had a heart condition that prevented him from having normal sexual intercourse.","Ghislaine Maxwell was the disgraced financer's aide, girlfriend and was a party in many cases of sexual exploitation.

Watch Colombia Leader Shot During Public Address; Shock Assassination Bid On Presidential Hopeful





Colombia endured one of its bloodiest days in recent months on Thursday after a police helicopter was shot down in Antioquia and a car bomb ripped through the city of Cali, killing at least 13 people and injuring dozens more.President Gustavo Petro said on X that eight police officers died when their helicopter came under attack during an operation to eradicate coca crops, the raw material used to produce cocaine.According to news agency AP, the aircraft was hit by a drone and caught fire before crashing, as per defence minister Pedro Sánchez. Antioquia Governor Andrés Julián confirmed the strike occurred as the helicopter flew over coca fields.Authorities said several others were injured in the incident, though their conditions were not immediately released.Videos circulating on social media showed the helicopter engulfed in black smoke as it crashed to the ground.Just hours later, a vehicle packed with explosives detonated outside a military aviation school in Cali, Colombia’s third-largest city. Officials confirmed five people were killed and more than 30 were wounded.Cali’s mayor, Alejandro Eder, said 36 were injured and announced a temporary ban on large trucks entering the city, along with a $10,000 reward for information.“There were fatalities among people passing by on the avenue,” eyewitness Alexis Atizabal was quoted as saying by AFP, describing widespread destruction across nearby homes and schools.Petro initially suggested the powerful Gulf Clan drug cartel was behind the helicopter attack, saying it could have been retaliation for a cocaine seizure. However, he later blamed dissident factions of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), particularly the Central General Staff (EMC) led by warlord Iván Mordisco.He vowed to designate EMC, Segunda Marquetalia and the Clan del Golfo as terrorist organisations.Bloomberg reported Petro warning that EMC fighters carried out both the helicopter strike and the Cali bombing. The president, who came to power in 2022 promising “total peace” through dialogue with armed groups, has faced criticism that his softer approach has emboldened guerrillas and cartels.According to the United Nations, coca cultivation in Colombia hit a record 253,000 hectares in 2023. Experts say the rise in production, along with escalating violence, signals that armed groups are regaining power despite the 2016 peace deal with FARC.Neighbouring communities fear a return to the dark days of the 1980s and 1990s, when cartel bombings and political killings were common.“Our country is going through the darkest, saddest, and most painful days,” said María Claudia Tarazona, widow of assassinated presidential candidate Miguel Uribe, during his funeral earlier this month, reported AFP.","Eight police officers killed when helicopter came under attack during operation to eradicate coca crops.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has fired Lt General Jeffrey Kruse as head of the US defense intelligence agency (DIA), following President Donald Trump’s dissatisfaction with the agency’s preliminary assessment of US strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, according to AP and other media reports.Kruse’s firing, first reported by The Washington Post, comes weeks after the agency’s initial intelligence estimate - which suggested Iran’s nuclear program had only been delayed by a few months - was leaked to the media. This contradicted President Trump’s public claim that the Iranian programme had been “completely and fully obliterated.”“You want to call it destroyed, you want to call it defeated, you want to call it obliterated - choose your word. This was an historically successful attack,” Hegseth said in a June press conference, defending the operation but without providing evidence.According to officials familiar with the matter, the decision was not publicly explained and comes amid a broader shake-up in the US military and intelligence leadership. Trump has previously removed officials whose reports or data contradict his public stance, including those in charge of jobs data and public health information.Kruse’s dismissal follows other senior-level exits, including air force general CQ Brown Jr, general Tim Haugh (NSA chief), and several senior legal officials across military branches. The office of the director of national intelligence has also announced staff and budget cuts this week.Pentagon officials have not released a formal statement on the rationale behind Kruse’s removal.

Turkish First Lady Emine Erdogan has written to US First Lady Melania Trump, urging her to speak out for the children of Gaza, as well, like she voiced her concern for the children of Ukraine. President Donald Trump handed over a letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Alaska meeting, which was seen as soft power at the play at its best. It was a peace letter in which Melani told Putin ""it is time"" to protect children and future generations around the globe.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy came to Washington with a letter from Ukraine's First Lady for Melania -- in a similar move.“I have faith that the important sensitivity you have shown for the 648 Ukrainian children... will be extended to Gaza as well,” Emine Erdogan wrote in the letter dated Aug 22 that was published by the Turkish presidency.“These days, when the world is experiencing a collective awakening and the recognition of Palestine has become a global will. I believe that your call on behalf of Gaza would fulfil a historic responsibility toward the Palestinian people,” Erdogan wrote, thanking Melania for taking up the cause of the children.The letter called on Melania to ""show the same sensitivity to Gaza that you have shown to Ukrainian children who have lost their lives in the war"". Erdogan urged Melania to appeal directly to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to ""end to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza"".The Turkish First Lady does not usually involve herself in politics, more often choosing to be active in environmental issues - which has earned her praise from UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres. But Erdogan has written letters to the partners of world leaders in the past, in 2016 on behalf of Syrians caught up in civil war and condemning Israel's actions in Gaza in March.","Turkish First Lady Emine Erdogan has written to US First Lady Melania Trump.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Big Op Sindoor Lie Claims India Begged For Ceasefire, Trump Stepped In





ISLAMABAD: Nearly 100 days after Indian fighter jets pounded “terror bases” in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), local police said they have arrested a man who allegedly passed on the GPS coordinates of a mosque that was among those hit.The May 6 raids had left the Bilal Mosque in Muzaffarabad badly damaged, with three fatalities reported. Now, PoK police say Obaid Jahangir of Rawalakot “sold out” by sharing its exact GPS location with India over WhatsApp, allegedly for money.Obaid has been booked under the draconian Official Secrets Act, 1923, with police claiming they had recovered “hard evidence” of espionage. “He passed on sensitive images and the mosque’s coordinates in exchange for hefty payments,” claimed SSP Riaz Mughal of PoK police’s counter-terrorism department (CTD).But the case is already mired in conflicting narratives. Another senior CTD officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, went further, alleging Jahangir had a past with a banned outfit before joining a so-called relief organisation. Investigators, he added, had traced communications with Indian handlers on his phone.The family, however, insists Obaid is no militant. His uncle admitted the 30-something may have “fallen into a money trap” but stressed he was only associated with the Jammu Kashmir United Movement, a relief body.“If he is guilty, he should face the law, but he has never been part of any militant outfit,” the uncle maintained.His lawyer, Abdul Samad, pointed out that the sections invoked against him cover trespassing into restricted areas and passing on information “prejudicial to national security”. Conviction under these clauses carries punishments ranging from 14 years in prison to life.Earlier this year, too, PoK police had arrested a police constable on charges of selling sensitive information across the border.","Indian fighter jets pounded ‘terror bases’ in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) Nearly 100 days later, local police said they have arrested a man who allegedly passed on the GPS coordinates of a mosque.

Officials said JeM aims to decentralise training camps and ensure long-term financing for ops.",Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) has launched a Rs 3.91 billion fundraising drive under the garb of building 313 mosques.

Pakistan blaze: Fireworks warehouse explosion injures at least 25; fire triggers road closures in Karachi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-blaze-fireworks-warehouse-explosion-injures-at-least-25-fire-triggers-road-closures-in-karachi/articleshow/123434002.cms,"



At least 25 people, including some in critical condition, were injured after an explosion took place at a fireworks storage facility in Karachi, Pakistan.Thick smoke could be seen billowing into the sky from the building where firecrackers were stored, according to television footage.Witnesses cited by AP said that broken glass from nearby shops covered the road and panicked residents fled the scene.Firefighters rushed to extinguish the blaze while ambulances ferried the injured, including passers-by, to hospitals.Senior police official Asad Raza said several shops and vehicles on Jinnah Road were damaged in the blast. The cause of the explosion was not immediately known.The fire was reported in a warehouse near Taj Complex on MA Jinnah Road, a Rescue 1122 spokesperson said, adding,“as soon as Rescue 1122’s Central Command and Control team received the information, the Fire and Rescue team reached the scene along with an ambulance and two fire brigade trucks.”Police surgeon Summaiya Syed told Dawn, “Sixteen injured at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre [with] two critical. Fourteen at Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Trauma Centre,” adding that the warehouse had been storing firecrackers.Karachi traffic police said MA Jinnah Road had been closed due to the fire, with traffic from Numaish being diverted towards Society Signal and Ali Raza Imambargah.Citizens were advised to call the Traffic Police helpline at 1915 for alternate routes “to avoid inconvenience,” the Dawn reported.Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and directed officials to control the blaze and ensure no lives were lost. According to a statement, he also ordered the Karachi Commissioner to provide immediate medical assistance to the injured and submit a detailed report. “There is no permission to produce materials near cities or populated areas which can cause damage,” CM Murad was quoted as saying.The Sindh home ministry later issued a statement saying 20 people had been injured in the blaze.Home minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar directed police reinforcements to the scene, saying, “Police reinforcements should be sent to rescue the injured and transfer them quickly to the nearest hospital. An investigation must be completed and a report submitted soon.”Lanjar also instructed investigators to include statements from the injured and evidence from the scene, Dawn furthed added.Explosions at fireworks facilities are not uncommon in Pakistan. In January, six people were killed in a similar blast at a fireworks storage site in Mandi Bahauddin, Punjab province. Fires in commercial and residential buildings are also frequent, largely blamed on poor infrastructure, weak enforcement of safety rules, and negligence.","At least 25 people, including some in critical condition, injured after explosion at fireworks storage facility in Karachi, Pakistan.

"Violence against minorities in Pakistan: Conversions, blasphemy killings on rise",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/violence-against-minorities-in-pakistan-conversions-blasphemy-killings-on-rise-what-human-rights-panel-said/articleshow/123431097.cms,"Forced conversions

Targeting Ahmadiyya community



Blasphemy accusations







The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has raised alarm over violence against minority communities in the country.HRCP on Thursday released its latest report, Streets of Fear: Freedom of Religion or Belief in 2024/25, documenting violations of freedom of religion or belief (FORB) between 1 July 2024 and 30 June 2025.The report painted a picture as grim as in previous years, recording targeted killings, forced conversions, mob lynchings, hate speech, desecration of places of worship and extrajudicial killings. It also warned that religious freedom in Pakistan is facing an unprecedented threat.The HRCP highlighted several cases where individuals were killed over blasphemy accusations, describing the trend as deeply troubling in a country that has already witnessed the assassination of a provincial governor by his own security guard.The HRCP report noted that the pattern of minor non-Muslim girls disappearing and later resurfacing after allegedly converting to Islam and marrying Muslim men persisted in 2024/25.Hindus in Sindh, who form 8.8% of the population, and Christians in Punjab (1.9%), have raised repeated concerns. A fact-finding study found that forced conversions and coerced marriages remain most prevalent among Scheduled Caste Hindus due to poverty and limited social mobility.The report highlighted the role of cleric-politician Mian Abdul Haq, or Mian Mithu, accused of using his influence to facilitate conversions at his seminary in Ghotki. He was sanctioned by the UK in 2022.The report also cited cases where police were seen siding with abductors, often claiming it would be “haram” to return a girl after conversion.In July 2024, Faisalabad police recovered Christian minor Laiba Suhail, abducted in February and forcibly converted before being married off illegally. Another girl, Alina, is still missing. In January 2025, a Mirpurkhas court heard a plea from a couple accused of forcing an underage Hindu girl to convert and marry.Other cases were reported across provinces: in April 2025, 14-year-old a Hindu girl, Chahat disappeared in Quetta and later claimed in a video to have converted, though her parents produced documents proving she was underage.In May, Hindu Panchayats in Ghotki and Rohri protested the disappearance of a Meghwar teenager in Rohri, fearing abduction for forced conversion. In June, civil society groups and Hindu Panchayats in Larkana expressed concern over three minor girls and a teenage boy from Shahdadpur allegedly being forced to convert.The HRCP stressed that such cases continue to deepen insecurity among religious minorities and called for protective measures to safeguard vulnerable children and their families.The report listed multiple killings of Ahmadis: dentist Zakaur Rahman in Lalamusa (July 2024), Tayyab Ahmad in Rawalpindi (December 2024), Amir Hasan in Naukot (December 2024), Laeeq Cheema lynched in Karachi (April 2025), Muhammad Asif in Kasur (April 2025), and senior doctor Mahmood Sheikh in Sargodha (May 2025).The UN warned, “We are alarmed by ongoing reports of violence and discrimination against the Ahmadiyya community in Pakistan.”“According to the data provided by the Ahmadiyya community, 29 Ahmadi places of worship were attacked and damaged during the review period,” the report said.It further added that in 26 cases, the demolition was carried out by law enforcement agencies.“These incidents occurred in Okara, Khanewal, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Vehari, Sheikhupura, Gujrat, and Sargodha, among other locations Back in January, a historic Sialkot site linked to Pakistan’s first foreign minister Zafarullah Khan was “reduced to rubble”.The report said that the blasphemy law has been often misused to settle personal scores or seek financial gain in Pakistan, where, a ‘mere accusation of blasphemy can be a death sentence.’In September, last year, two men accused of blasphemy were killed while in police custody less than a week apart. One was inexplicably shot and killed in Mirpurkhas during an alleged police encounter, and the other was killed by a police constable inside a police station in Quetta.On 12 September 2024, constable Saad Khan Sarhadi shot dead Abdul Ali, a blasphemy suspect, inside Quetta’s Cantonment Police Station after mobs from religious parties gathered outside demanding his custody. It marked the first such incident in the city where a serving officer killed a suspect in custody. Days later, Ali’s family pardoned Sarhadi, while lawyers and a JUI-F senator pledged legal support for him.Later, on 17 September 2024, Shahnawaz Kunbhar, a civil hospital employee from Umerkot, fled to Karachi after a cleric accused him of posting blasphemous content. He denied the charge in a video message before being arrested by police, who assured his family of protection. Two days later, police claimed he was killed in an encounter, with officers celebrated as heroes.His family was prevented from burying him by armed mobs, and the body was desecrated. Following outrage from rights groups, a Sindh police inquiry declared the encounter “fake.”The report also showed that the mainstream media largely ignored issues of religious freedom under the period covered. Even the Islamabad High Court’s hearings into the “blasphemy business group,” affecting nearly 400 households and livestreamed for four months, drew little coverage. Likewise, cases of coerced marriages, forced conversions and violence against minorities rarely made headlines.A worrying trend has emerged in Pakistan, where ultra-right-wing groups are exerting growing pressure on the judiciary and elected officials through propaganda and intimidation, it added.","The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has raised alarm over violence against minority communities in the country.

’14 Pakistani Soldiers Killed’: Baloch Rebels Attack Day After India’s Strike On Terror Hubs | Watch





The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for an attack in Panjgur that left four Pakistan 's army personnel dead. According to BLA spokesperson Jeeyand Baloch, fighters launched a raid in the Surdu area of Panjgur on Tuesday night, eliminating a key operative of the Pakistan army.The statement revealed that Ghulam Sarwar had earlier established and commanded a so-called death squad under the protection of the Pakistani military. This squad, which had been active for years in Gichek and other parts of Panjgur, was later led by his son, Islam Sarwar. The group allegedly supported the army's operations, carrying out targeted killings, enforced disappearances, and other violent acts. In return, the army reportedly allowed them to freely engage in drug trafficking, kidnappings for ransom and extortion through road checkpoints.During the operation, BLA fighters seized three Kalashnikov rifles, an M-4, additional weapons, two vehicles, and three motorcycles from Islam Sarwar's hideout. The site, according to the BLA, also served as a torture chamber, where electric shock devices and other tools of abuse were found. Islam Sarwar was accused of abducting and killing a young man in Panjgur just two months earlier. Jeeyand Baloch warned that the Pakistani army and its allies would be held accountable for crimes against the Baloch people.The BLA's latest offensive is part of the ongoing insurgency in Balochistan , where separatist groups are demanding greater autonomy and recognition of Baloch rights. In recent years, attacks on military and paramilitary forces, along with government facilities, have intensified.Separatist factions argue that the Baloch people face systemic marginalisation and exploitation, despite the province's wealth in natural resources. In response, Pakistan's military has pursued counterinsurgency campaigns to suppress the rebellion. However, human rights groups have repeatedly raised concerns over reports of forced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and excessive force during these operations.Numerous accounts point to the widespread issue of disappearances, with civilians and activists allegedly detained without due legal process. Rights organisations argue that such tactics fuel fear and deepen mistrust, further straining relations between the Pakistani state and the Baloch population.","Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for an attack in Panjgur that left four Pakistan's army personnel dead.
