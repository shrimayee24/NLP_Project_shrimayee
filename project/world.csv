You can't have woke military.""Trump's remarks were in response to a question about his plans for the ""woke generals at the top"" during an exclusive interview with Fox & Friends Weekend in June.His comments followed the Pentagon's decision to honor Pride Month, which led to the official Facebook page for the US Navy SEALs and Naval Special Warfare Command being mocked for marking the start of the month-long celebration.In the interview, Trump claimed that he knew the ""real fighting generals"" and that there was no place for ""woke"" ideology in the military, except at the top levels. This is not the first time the former President has been embroiled in controversy over his comments about the military.He has previously referred to fallen soldiers as ""losers and suckers"" and instructed his aides to exclude disabled veterans from events.Moreover, Trump recently claimed that the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award, holds more significance than the Medal of Honor, the highest military award, because its recipients are either deceased or have sustained combat injuries. These comments have drawn criticism from various quarters, with many questioning his respect for the military and its sacrifices.","US Vice President Kamala Harris's campaign team shared a video clip from a Fox News interview in which Trump stated, ""I would get rid of them.

This is the third killing of a civilian by insurgents in just five days and the second time a cop's kin was murdered in Bijapur this year.Police identified the victim as 27-year-old Sudru Karam of Timenar, a remote village in Mirtoor region.According to preliminary information, Sudru was abducted from his village on Tuesday morning and dragged to the forest. His body was found dumped on the outskirts of the village at night.Unlike the other murders where Maoists killed villagers after branding them police informers, Sudru was killed simply because his brother is a head constable deployed on anti-Naxal operations and Maoists wanted to terrorise locals. The insurgents want to prevent Bastar youngsters from joining security forces. Last year, 41 civilians were murdered and 12 injured in Maoist violence in Bastar.On Aug 22, a farmer was murdered in Pusnar village. Maoists tied a note to his leg, mocking him as a 'landlord' and saying he was killed because he worked for police and did not heed 'summons' issued by the so-called jan adalat. His body was found the day Union home minister Amit Shah was to arrive in Chhattisgarh for a security review.","Maoists in Chhattisgarh's Bijapur have murdered the brother of a policeman.

'Enough is enough': President Murmu on RG Kar rape-murder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/enough-is-enough-prez-on-rg-kar-rape-murder/articleshow/112878752.cms,"Must help women win

fear

, says Murmu

NEW DELHI: In a rare intervention, President Droupadi Murmu on Wednesday spoke out against a series of brutal rapes across the country and called for ""honest self-introspection"" to go to the root of the ""malaise"".""The gruesome rape and murder of a doctor in Kolkata has left the nation shocked. I was dismayed and horrified. What's more depressing is...it is part of a series of crimes against women . The victims include even kindergarten girls,"" she said in a signed article for PTI. ""Let us collectively say enough is enough.""Even as students, doctors and citizens were protesting in Kolkata, criminals remained on the prowl elsewhere. “We owe it to our daughters to remove the hurdles from their path of winning freedom from fear,” Prez Murmu said.The President lamented the pattern of episodic outrage against atrocities like the Nirbhaya rape case only to develop “collective amnesia” until jolted into a furious response by another gruesome crime against women.Recalling the Nirbhaya incident, which generated “shock and awe”, the President said, “We were determined not to let another Nirbhaya meet the same fate. We made plans and devised strategies. These initiatives did make a difference to an extent. Yet, our task remains unfinished as long as any woman feels unsafe in the environment where she lives or works.” She said “collective amnesia” about the gruesome incidents was as “obnoxious” as the mindset of some. “I am of the firm belief that we should not let amnesia prevail over the memory of such criminality. Let us deal with this perversion in a comprehensive manner so as to curb it right at the beginning. We can do this only if we honour the memory of the victims by cultivating a social culture of remembering them to remind us of our failures in the past and prepare us to be more vigilant in future,” Murmu said. She also sought to address underlying causes such as the “objectification of women by a few” which, she said, allowed crimes against women to keep happening despite the enactment of tough laws.“Countering this mindset is a task for both the state and society. In India, over the years, the two have fought hard to change the wrong attitude. There have been laws and there have been social campaigns. Yet, there is something that continues to come in the way and to torment us,” she said.BJP on Wednesday said President Droupadi Murmu’s remarks on crimes against women reflect the gravity of the issue and it’s time to rise above party politics and ensure that justice is done in such cases.The party’s reaction came after Murmu, in an article for PTI, spoke out for the first time on the rape and murder of a doctor in Kolkata and expressed her anguish at continuing crimes against women.","President Droupadi Murmu spoke out against a series of brutal rapes across the country.

LUCKNOW: Englishman James Shirley's 17th-century poem ""Death the Leveller"" is a lyrical reminder that ""sceptre and crown/must tumble down/and in the dust be equal made"".Four centuries later, as a bulldozer stopped in front of Kotwali police station in UP's Siddharthanagar and a band of bewildered cops tried to make sense of what was happening, the word ""leveller"" resonated in more ways than one.The irony wasn't lost on a bemused crowd of onlookers as the bulldozer laid its ""icy hand"" on the police station's boundary wall and gate, listed among 55 illegal structures that the administration had set out to demolish to reclaim govt land for a road whose span had shrunk by more than half due to encroachment .The men in khaki seemed all the more surprised as they had been part of Sunday's drive, little knowing that the police station's wall was among the structures to be razed.The demolition action expectedly met with resistance from the cops. “How can you demolish a portion of our police station without a written order?” station house officer Santosh Tiwari demanded to know from the officials leading the team.“If we are demolishing illegal structures and the police station is among them, how can we make an exception?” replied additional district magistrate Umashankar Singh, accompanied by subdivisional magistrate Lalit Kumar to the site.The SHO called circle officer Arun Kant Tiwari next as the ‘police vs administration’ matchup continued, watched with particular interest by some who had already lost portions of their properties to the bulldozer action .When one of the cops asked ADM Singh why the tehsil office’s boundary wall across the street had not been targeted, he decided it was time to “prove the administration’s commitment to fairness”.The bulldozer hurtled across the street to bring down a 100-metre span of the tehsil’s southern boundary wall. Amid cheers from the crowd, the bulldozer returned to the police station.A call from district police chief Prachi Singh finally broke the deadlock.Kotwali police station wasn’t the only official structure to be targeted for encroachment. A portion of the local Panchayat Bhawan was demolished too. District magistrate Raja Ganapathy R said the administration had been trying to rid Khajuria Road of encroachments since 2017. “The road was 6m wide before demolition. Now, it’s 13m.”",Kotwali police station in UP's Siddharthanagar razed to reclaim govt land. The wall was among 55 illegal structures that the administration had set out to demolish.

He followed up by resharing a post from the account OSINTdefender, adding his own caption: ""POV: It’s 2030 in Europe and you’re being executed for liking a meme.""

'Total failure on Washington DC'

Sheriff’s call to action

Broader issue

'Unless they commit a violent felony...'

A Florida sheriff slammed Washington, DC lawmakers for their ""complete and total failure"" to secure the US border after several illegal immigrants were arrested in Florida last week for allegedly stealing thousands of pounds of palmetto berries.Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey announced in a video on August 26 that eight suspects, including four illegal immigrants, were arrested for stealing approximately $7,300 worth of palmetto berries from private property.The suspects loaded around 9,000 pounds of berries into a U-Haul, according to a Fox News report.Ivey, who has made multiple trips to the US southern border, said that the issue is not with local enforcement agencies but with Washington, DC lawmakers. “This is a complete and total failure on Washington, DC, for not allowing the laws of our great nation to be enforced,” he said.Sheriff Ivey questioned when the nation will lose tolerance for those illegally entering the US to commit additional crimes. He addressed Washington officials, saying, “Why don’t you allow our Customs and Border Patrol agents to secure our damn border like our laws allow, or get the hell out of the way, and I’ll do it with the help ofsheriffs from across the country who actually believe in enforcing the law and are sick and tired of this crap,” according to a Fox News report.Sheriff Ivey emphasised that while this incident ""may not seem like a big deal to some,"" it highlights a broader issue involving illegal immigrants committing crimes in the US. ""What this case revealed about the subjects who were arrested and the fact that they are in our country illegally drives me absolutely insane,"" Ivey said, according to Fox News report.Of the four illegal immigrants arrested, two are applying for US citizenship and cannot be deported due to pending court dates regarding their immigration status, said Ivey. The sheriff noted that some of the suspects had been deported previously and had prior felony arrests. He expressed frustration over the lack of enforcement, stating, “Unless they commit a violent felony, they’re not going to be deported no matter how many nonviolent crimes they’ve committed.”","Eight suspects, including four illegal immigrants, were arrested for stealing approximately $7,300 worth of palmetto berries from private property.

At least nine Palestinians killed as Israel mounts major West Bank operation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/at-least-nine-palestinians-killed-as-israel-mounts-major-west-bank-operation/articleshow/112873589.cms,"'Something came down from the sky'

JENIN: At least nine Palestinians were killed on Wednesday, Palestinian authorities said, as Israeli forces raided the flashpoint cities of Jenin and Tulkarm as well as other areas in the occupied West Bank in a major operation involving helicopters and drones.The assault, one of the largest seen in the West Bank for months, followed a series of smaller raids in the area over recent weeks as Israeli forces sought to crush groups of fighters from Palestinian militant groups.With Israeli forces battling Hamas fighters in Gaza and facing a major escalation of tensions with the Iranian-backed Hezbollah movement in southern Lebanon, Wednesday's operation underscored the multiple security threats Israel has been battling since the start of the Gaza war last year.The armed wings of the Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Fatah factions said in separate statements their gunmen were detonating bombs against Israeli military vehicles in the three West Bank areas.By midday, the city of Jenin was relatively quiet but in the crowded refugee camp, a heavily built up township adjacent to the main urban area, occasional explosions could be heard.A short distance outside the city, blood soaked the ground next to a damaged car and an impact crater from a drone strike the Israeli military said had killed three militant fighters.The Palestinian health ministry said troops had surrounded Jenin's main hospital, blocking off access with earth mounds - a measure the military said was intended to stop fighters seeking refuge.A military spokesperson said Wednesday's operation followed a sharp rise in militant activity in recent months, with more than 150 attacks involving shooting or explosives from Tulkarm and Jenin in the past year.He said the military assessed there was an ""immediate threat"" to civilians but he said the operation was part of a broad strategy aimed at thwarting attacks.""This terror threat in this area is not new, it hasn't started yesterday and it's not going to end tomorrow,"" Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani told reporters in a briefing.Earlier, the military released the names of five Palestinians identified as militant fighters who were killed in Tulkarm on Monday. Two were claimed by Hamas and three by Islamic Jihad.As well as the major raids in Jenin and Tulkarm, two of the most volatile cities in the northern West Bank, the military said forces also raided the town of Far'a near Tubas in the Jordan Valley, killing at least four people in a drone strike.Masoud Naaja, the father of two young men killed in the strike, said he was giving water to some men who asked for a drink when he was wounded.""In seconds, very fast, we felt like something came down on us from the sky and there was an explosion,"" he said. ""When I put my hand on my chest, it was full of shrapnel and blood.""Clashes in the West Bank have risen sharply since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. Israel, which says Iran has provided weapons and support to the militant factions, has stepped up operations, while Jewish settlers have also launched frequent vigilante-style attacks on Palestinian communities.Thousands of Palestinians have been arrested in raids and more than 660 - fighters and civilians - have been killed in the West Bank and East Jerusalem since the war in Gaza began nearly 11 months ago, according to Palestinian Health Ministry figures.At least 30 Israelis have been killed in attacks in Jerusalem and the West Bank during the period, according to Israeli tallies.The latest round of Israeli-Palestinian violence began on October 7 after Hamas militants stormed into southern Israel, killing 1,200 and taking more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli figures.Israel's Gaza campaign has since levelled swathes of the enclave, displaced nearly all its 2.3 million people multiple times, given rise to deadly hunger and disease and killed more than 40,500 people, Palestinian health officials say.Internationally mediated talks to end the conflict continue, with Hamas and Israel trading blame for a lack of progress, and the United States expressing optimism that a ceasefire can be reached.","Israeli forces raid flashpoint cities of Jenin and Tulkarm as well as other areas in the occupied West Bank.

Vance claimed the media is exaggerating the situation, which reportedly involved a physical altercation and unauthorized filming at a gravesite.“The altercation at Arlington Cemetery is the media creating a story where I really don’t think there is one,” Vance said.Vance defended the Trump campaign, asserting they had proper authorization to have a photographer at the cemetery. “There is verifiable evidence that the campaign was allowed to have a photographer there. They were invited to have a photographer there.”He emphasized that families of the 13 service members who died at Abbey Gate during the Kabul evacuation wanted Trump’s presence as a show of support. “They wanted Donald Trump there, and thank God we have a president who stands with our veterans instead of one who runs away from them,” he added.Despite Vance’s defense, he avoided addressing the specifics of the incident, particularly the prohibition on filming in Section 60 of the cemetery.Progressive veterans' group VoteVets responded sharply, labeling Vance as “a spineless, gutless fraud” and accusing him of betraying the solemnity of the graves. “Political activity is and was always illegal at Arlington,” VoteVets said. “Trump’s campaign got physical with cemetery staff who were upholding the law and protecting the solemnity of all the graves. Rather than stand up for them, JD Vance betrays them to make Trump happy. Pathetic.”The Trump campaign has denied claims of a physical confrontation and has yet to release footage that could corroborate their side of the story. Campaign spokesman Steven Cheung claimed a private photographer was allowed on-site and blamed an unnamed individual for blocking Trump’s team.Vance also criticized Vice President Kamala Harris, calling her “disgraceful” for her role in the US military’s withdrawal from Afghanistan. He further attacked Harris for her response to Trump’s visit, saying, “She can go to hell.”","Ohio Senator JD Vance dismissed media reports about a contentious incident involving Donald Trump ’s campaign at Arlington National Cemetery.

The heavy downpour caused a landslide that buried a house in the central city of Gamagori, resulting in the deaths of three residents and injuring two others.On the southern island of Amami, where the storm had already passed, a person was knocked down by a wind gust while riding a motorcycle, according to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency.Footage from Japan Broadcasting Corporation showed walls torn and window glass of buildings broken in Miyazaki with objects scattered on the street or hanging from utility poles.Authorities warned the storm could be one of the strongest ever to hit the region, and local governments have issued evacuation orders for millions of residents in several prefectures, as reported by Reuters news agency.More than 250,000 households in seven prefectures are experiencing power outages, according to Kyushu Electric Power Co.Yoshifumi Matsumura, Japan's Disaster Management Minister, warned that the typhoon could bring ""unprecedented"" levels of violent winds, high waves, storm surges, and heavy rain. He urged people, particularly older adults, to prioritise safety and seek shelter promptly.The storm's impact has led to widespread disruption, with hundreds of domestic flights cancelled and train services suspended across southwestern Japan. Postal and delivery services have also been halted in Kyushu, and many supermarkets and stores have closed as a precaution.Weather and government officials are concerned about extensive damage as the typhoon slowly sweeps up the Japanese archipelago over the next few days.","Typhoon Shanshan made landfall in the southern island of Kyushu in Japan on Thursday, bringing torrential rain and strong winds.

The campaign stop , which was meant to showcase Vance’s down-to-earth charm, instead became an internet sensation for all the wrong reasons.The now-infamous video captured Vance attempting to engage in small talk with a visibly uncomfortable clerk.With 20 Secret Service agents and 15 cameras in the shop, the woman appeared more like a deer caught in headlights than a willing participant in Vance's photo op. In his recent interview, Vance tried to put a positive spin on the fiasco, attributing the awkwardness to the clerk’s nervousness rather than any campaign misstep.“I just felt terrible for that woman,” Vance confessed, reported the NBC. “We walked in, and there’s 20 Secret Service agents, and there’s 15 cameras, and she clearly had not been properly warned, and she was terrified, right? I just felt awful for her.”Vance claimed the incident prompted him to reassess his campaign strategy, suggesting that future stops would include a more considerate approach. “I like to get out there and talk to people, and we want to make sure we’re doing it, but definitely make sure that people are at least OK with being on camera,” he added.Despite Vance’s attempts to downplay the situation, the internet was far from forgiving. Memes and TikTok parodies exploded online, with users ridiculing his clumsy interaction and speculating about his campaign team's alleged sabotage. The viral backlash intensified following Minnesota Governor Tim Walz's smooth, untroubled visit to a Nebraska sandwich shop just a day earlier. Walz's effortless rapport with the staff and his confident order contrasted sharply with Vance’s blunders, fueling comparisons and adding fuel to the fire.In his interview, Vance also took a swipe at the Harris-Walz campaign, referencing their recent Sheetz gas station stop where Walz handed Harris a bag of Doritos. Vance dismissed the staged nature of such events, saying, “We don’t want to have these scripted events—I don’t want to go and do three takes of buying Doritos at a Sheetz.”While Vance’s donut shop disaster has dominated headlines and memes, it remains to be seen how this embarrassing episode will impact his campaign’s fortunes as he battles to secure his place on the national stage.","Ohio Senator JD Vance broke his silence on the cringeworthy donut shop incident that has sent shockwaves across social media.

The downward spiral

The regret that never faded

The tragic death of Matthew Perry in 2021 from a ketamine overdose shocked fans worldwide. But recent revelations have suggested that his struggles may have been deeply tied to regrets about his love life . One of Perry's ex-girlfriends has come forward with startling insights into the actor's emotional state leading up to his death, painting a picture of a man haunted by what could have been.Kayti Edwards, who dated Perry in 2006 and worked as his assistant years earlier, has revealed that despite his relationships with Hollywood's elite, Perry often spoke of Rachel Dunn as ""the love of his life"", reported the Mirror US.Rachel, who was 14 years younger than Perry, represented a time in his life when he felt genuinely happy and grounded—a stark contrast to the turbulent years that followed their breakup .According to the Mirror US, Edwards described Perry's deep regret over ending his relationship with Rachel. ""He was happy, content, and most importantly, sober when he was with her,"" Edwards said. ""But after they broke up, everything seemed to unravel for him.""Edwards believes that Perry's breakup with Rachel was a turning point in his life—one that marked the beginning of his downward spiral into addiction . ""I noticed a significant change in him after they split,"" she recalled. ""He started using drugs more heavily, and it was like he just gave up. He lived with a lot of regret, and I think that haunted him.""Perry's relationship with Rachel, although lasting only two years, left a lasting impact on him. According to Edwards, it wasn't just about losing Rachel but also about losing the simple, genuine love they shared. ""Rachel loved him before he became a huge star. It was a pure kind of love, and I think that's why it affected him so deeply when it ended,"" Edwards explained.In a candid moment, Perry had once confided in Edwards that he regretted not marrying Rachel. ""He wanted kids, a family , and I think he struggled with the fact that time was slipping away, and he hadn't achieved those things,"" Edwards said. Despite other relationships after Rachel, Perry never seemed to move on. ""He loved her so much, and I don't think he ever found that kind of love again.""Perry's feelings for Rachel were so profound that, according to RadarOnline, he even named her as one of the beneficiaries in a will he drafted in 2009.

Sullivan's first trip to China as national security adviser was aimed at keeping high-level communications open and stabilising bilateral relations to avoid conflict.The White House statement said both sides would keep lines of communication open, including planning for a ""leader-level call"" in the coming weeks.There was no indication the two leaders might meet in person before Biden leaves the Oval Office.The White House said the two sides also planned to hold a military theater commander telephone call in the near future.China has rapidly expanded its military, and there are concerns that Taiwan and the South China Sea are becoming flashpoints.Wang told Sullivan that Taiwan's independence poses the greatest threat to stability in the immediate region. He demanded that the US ""stop arming the island but support China's peaceful unification,"" according to a statement released by the Chinese Foreign Ministry.Taiwan, a self-governing island democracy that split from authoritarian communist China in 1949, has rejected Beijing's demands that it accept unification with the mainland by peace or by force. The US is obligated under a domestic law to provide the island with sufficient hardware and technology to deter invasion.The White House statement said Sullivan ""underscored the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait "".Sullivan planned to meet with China's Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission Zhang Youxia on Thursday morning, according to a senior Biden administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the yet to be publicly announced meeting.Zhang has spoken in the past of Beijing's determination to take control of Taiwan. At an international naval gathering earlier this year in northeast China, Zhang said China would strike back with force if its interests came under threat.He said China's territorial sovereignty ""brooks no infringement and its core interests cannot be challenged. We do not provoke trouble, but we will never flinch in face of provocation. The Chinese military will resolutely defend the reunification and interest of the motherland"".Beijing also warned Washington ""not to support or indulge the Philippines to infringe"" upon China's rights and interests in the South China Sea. China and the Philippines have clashed over the Second Thomas Shoal and lately the Sabina Shoal.The US military has pushed back against China's claim to virtually the entire South China Sea, saying this week it would be open to consultations about escorting Philippine ships in the disputed sea amid a spike in hostilities between Beijing and Manila on the issue.The White House said Sullivan reaffirmed the US commitment to defending its Indo-Pacific allies and expressed concern about Beijing's destabilizing actions against ""lawful Philippine maritime operations"" in the South China Sea.The Philippines has called for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to do more. The 10-nation Southeast Asian bloc includes the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei, which have South China Sea claims that overlap with each other as well as China's and Taiwan's.The US has shifted its policy with China from engagement to competition. The Biden administration has made it a priority to prevent the competition from spiralling out of control, while seeking to collaborate with China in areas such as climate change, artificial intelligence and enforcement against illicit drugs.John Podesta, the senior adviser to the president for international climate policy, will travel to China, and Sullivan and Wang discussed ""next steps to reduce the flow of illicit synthetic drugs"" and ""continue repatriation of undocumented migrants,"" the White House said.The US Border Patrol in July made 1,851 arrests of Chinese immigrants on the border with Mexico, down from the December high of 5,951.The two sides also agreed to hold a second round of dialogue over artificial intelligence, the Chinese foreign ministry said.Sullivan raised continued concerns about China's trade policies and non-market economic practices, the White House said.Wang demanded the US ""stop suppressing China in the areas of trade, economic and technology,"" the Chinese foreign ministry said.By resorting to protectionism, the US would only ""hurt the global green development and affect the global economic growth,"" Wang told Sullivan.","Beijing and Washington will plan for a phone call in the coming weeks between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan met Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Beijing. China has rapidly expanded its military, and there are concerns that Taiwan and the South China Sea are becoming flashpoints.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112881337,imgsize-861395,width-400,resizemode-4/112881337.jpg"
"US elections: Trump reposts a vulgar remark about Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton on social media, sparks row",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-elections-trump-reposts-a-vulgar-remark-about-kamala-harris-and-hillary-clinton-on-social-media-sparks-row/articleshow/112880871.cms,"Former President Donald J Trump took to his social media platform, Truth Social , and stirred a controversy on Wednesday by reposting a crude remark about Vice President Kamala Harris . The remark, which was initially posted by one of Trump’s supporters, suggested that Harris advanced her political career through sexual favors, referencing her past relationship with former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown .The reposted comment linked Harris’s career rise to her past relationship with Brown, who was Speaker of the California State Assembly during their relationship. The remark also included a derogatory reference to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, alluding to her husband’s affair with Monica Lewinsky .Trump’s repost, which featured a screenshot of the offensive comment, followed a pattern of personal and sexist attacks against Harris.The reposted image contained a comment that read, “Funny how blowjobs impacted both their careers differently…”—a reference to Bill Clinton’s impeachment and Harris’s past relationship with Brown.This remark has drawn sharp criticism for its explicit nature and the implications it carries about Harris's career achievements.This is the second time in recent weeks that Trump has shared sexually charged attacks on the vice president, reflecting his history of crass insults against political opponents.On August 18, he shared a video from the Dilley Meme Team, which included a parody of Alanis Morissette’s “Ironic” that denigrated Harris in a similar fashion. Trump’s recent posts, including over 30 reposts in a 30-minute span on Wednesday, also featured conspiracy theories and calls for the prosecution of political adversaries.Harris’s campaign has largely avoided engaging with Trump’s personal attacks, while critics argue that Trump’s rhetoric could alienate key voter groups, including women and Black voters. Harris, the first Black woman and first person of South Asian descent to be a major party's presidential nominee, has faced such attacks throughout her career, which she and her supporters have dismissed as sexist and unfounded.Trump’s history of gender-based attacks is well-documented, including during his 2016 presidential campaign against Hillary Clinton. His controversial remarks and behavior, including a recent $83.3 million judgment for defamation against writer E Jean Carroll, have sparked ongoing debates about his conduct and its impact on his political standing.","Former President Donald Trump reposted a crude remark about Vice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday.

The outburst came during a rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, and marks Vance's most vehement criticism of Harris to date.Vance's comments were triggered by a question about former President Donald Trump's recent visit to Arlington National Cemetery.Trump had visited the site with families of service members who were killed during the 2021 attack at Abbey Gate, Kabul, as the chaotic withdrawal unfolded.“Three years ago, 13 brave, innocent Americans died because Kamala Harris failed to do her job,” Vance declared. “There hasn't been a single investigation or firing. To see those 13 lives lost and not hold anyone accountable is disgraceful. Kamala Harris is disgraceful.”He continued, “If we're talking about Abbey Gate, it’s that Kamala Harris is so asleep at the wheel that she hasn’t even bothered to investigate what happened. Instead, she chooses to yell at Donald Trump for showing up. She can, she can go to hell.”The Trump campaign has yet to comment on Vance's remarks, and the Harris campaign declined to respond. Vance later elaborated on his frustration during an interview with NBC News.“I get frustrated, and I get pissed off,” Vance admitted. “Kamala Harris’ leadership failure at Abbey Gate is absolutely something to be angry about. And when she turns the focus onto Trump instead of addressing her own failures, it justifies my frustration.”Vance also criticized the Harris campaign for allegedly politicizing the incident at Arlington National Cemetery, suggesting that Harris' response to the tragedy was more about political maneuvering than genuine empathy.In response to the third anniversary of the Abbey Gate attack , Harris expressed her sorrow for the families affected and reaffirmed her commitment to honoring the service and sacrifice of American troops. She defended President Biden's decision to end the US involvement in Afghanistan, calling it “the courageous and right decision.”The chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, culminating in the tragic events at Abbey Gate, remains a contentious issue in American politics, with both parties leveraging it to criticize their opponents.","Senator JD Vance took aim at Vice President Kamala Harris during a rally in Pennsylvania.

Votes from Muslim and Arab Americans could help decide the outcome in battleground states like Michigan , which has seen street protests over the Israel-Gaza war.U.S. President Joe Biden won a large share of the Arab and Muslim vote in 2020, but his support for Israel despite the huge death toll in Gaza has frustrated many community members. They launched an ""uncommitted"" campaign against him in the Democratic nominating contests.Michigan, where Harris is due to visit next week, is home to one of the largest Muslim and Arab American populations in the United States. More than 100,000 voters cast their ballot ""uncommitted"" instead of Biden, who stepped aside as candidate on July 21, in the state's primary.Some activists say they hold Harris responsible for the Biden administration's Israel policy and the crisis in Gaza.Following last week's Democratic convention, pro-Palestinian activists said Harris had failed to demonstrate any break from the status quo.While pro-Palestinian voices are not expected to vote for Trump and have indicated no support for the Republican, some activists have launched a campaign called ""Abandon Harris"" and have urged their supporters to back third-party candidates.Abdelall, Harris' pick for Arab American outreach, most recently served as senior counselor to the Department of Homeland Security's secretary. She joined the agency in January, 2021, shortly after Trump left office, to be chief of staff for the department's civil rights office.Abdelall, who grew up in Ann Arbor, Michigan, previously ran a food blog and website focused on Middle Eastern cuisine. She has taught Middle Eastern cooking classes at a culinary school in northern Virginia.The latest bloodshed in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict was triggered on Oct. 7 when Palestinian Islamist group Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.Israel's subsequent assault on the Hamas-governed enclave has since killed over 40,000 Palestinians, according to the local health ministry, while also displacing nearly the entire population of 2.3 million, causing a hunger crisis and leading to genocide allegations at the World Court that Israel denies.",Kamala Harris' campaign has hired an Egyptian American lawyer and former Department of Homeland Security official.

VP and running mate visit Georgia in bid to sway GOP strongholds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-elections-harris-and-walzs-bus-tour-vp-and-running-mate-visit-georgia-in-bid-to-sway-gop-strongholds/articleshow/112880745.cms,"Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz , made an unexpected visit to Liberty County High School on Wednesday as part of a two-day bus tour through southeast Georgia . The Democratic ticket is campaigning heavily in the critical battleground state, aiming to make inroads into traditionally Republican areas ahead of the November election.During the visit, the high school band performed their school fight song, and Harris, addressing the students, expressed her admiration and optimism for the younger generation.“We’re so proud of you and we’re counting on you,” she said to the enthusiastic crowd, some of whom were visibly excited by the vice president’s presence, reported AP. Harris encouraged the students, noting that she too had once been in the band, and offered them a piece of advice: “Just keep going at it.”This visit is part of a broader strategy by the Harris-Walz campaign to engage voters in GOP strongholds and to showcase a more personal side of the candidates. The campaign believes that winning over these areas is essential to securing a victory in Georgia, a state that played a pivotal role in the 2020 election. The bus tour is set to culminate in a rally in Savannah on Thursday.Michael Tyler, Harris’ campaign communications director, emphasized the importance of reaching out to communities that don’t typically see Democratic candidates. “We’re competing in all communities,” Tyler said, adding that the campaign hopes these informal stops will generate viral moments that resonate with voters nationwide.In addition to their high school visit, Harris and Walz made a stop at Sandfly, a barbecue restaurant in Savannah, where they interacted with local patrons, including teachers who expressed their appreciation for Walz’s background as a former high school teacher.The bus tour reflects a continuation of the Democratic strategy to connect with voters on a personal level, a tactic used effectively in previous campaigns, including President Biden’s. The campaign has also launched a new ad in battleground states, seeking to tie former President Donald Trump to the conservative “Project 2025,” a plan that includes replacing civil servants with Trump loyalists and reversing certain FDA approvals.The Georgia visit is a makeup for an earlier planned trip that was postponed due to Tropical Storm Debby. Harris is scheduled to continue her campaign efforts with President Biden on Labor Day, just as the election season enters its final stretch.The contrasting approaches between the two campaigns were evident when Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, struggled to engage with workers during a recent visit to a bakery in Valdosta, Georgia. Vance later expressed sympathy for a worker who appeared overwhelmed by the media presence.","Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, made an unexpected visit to Liberty County High School on Wednesday.

What’s at stake

In a highly anticipated event that could shape the course of the 2024 presidential election , former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris will face off in their first presidential debate on September 10. With the general election looming just weeks away on November 5, the debate promises to be a pivotal moment in the race for the White House.The journey to this debate has been anything but smooth.Initially, Trump resisted agreeing to a debate with Harris, insisting that he would only participate if she officially secured the Democratic nomination. That milestone was reached last week at the Democratic National Convention, where Harris was formally nominated after President Joe Biden stepped aside. With the nomination confirmed, Trump quickly shifted gears, agreeing to the debate but raising concerns about the use of “hot mics” that could capture off-the-cuff remarks during the event.However, on Tuesday, Trump announced that he had “reached an agreement” with the Harris campaign to proceed with the debate, hosted by ABC News, a network he has frequently criticized as being biased against him.The debate will take place at 9 pm EDT on Tuesday (6:30 am on Wednesday in India), September 10, at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. The choice of venue is symbolic, as Philadelphia is not only one of the key battleground states in this election but also home to the Liberty Bell and a museum dedicated to the US Constitution, highlighting the foundational principles at stake in this election.Moderated by ABC’s David Muir and Linsey Davis, the debate will be live-streamed on various platforms. The format is expected to follow the precedent set by a previous debate between Biden and Trump in June, which featured muted microphones when candidates were not speaking and excluded a live audience to maintain focus on the candidates' responses.Both campaigns have agreed to the same rules as the June debate, which include muted microphones when candidates are not speaking, no live audience, and no props. There will be two commercial breaks during the debate, giving the candidates brief pauses amid what is expected to be a heated exchange of ideas and accusations.Vice President Kamala Harris, now the Democratic nominee, and Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, are the only candidates currently expected to take the stage. Although third-party candidates have until September 3 to qualify for the debate, they must meet stringent criteria, including appearing on a sufficient number of state ballots and reaching at least 15% support in four national polls. Given these requirements, it is unlikely that any third-party candidates will join Harris and Trump in this crucial debate.With the general election just weeks away, this debate will be a critical opportunity for both candidates to sway undecided voters and solidify their base. For Trump, it’s a chance to reassert his influence and demonstrate his continued relevance in the political arena. For Harris, it’s an opportunity to step out from Biden’s shadow and establish herself as a strong leader ready to take on the highest office in the land.","Donald Trump and Kamala Harris will face off in their first presidential debate on September 10.

But Trump prefers this sort of snake pit because he understands snakes.On Tuesday, The New York Times reported that Trump plans to name Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , who both recently endorsed him, as honorary co-chairs of his presidential transition team.Gabbard and Kennedy sought the Democratic nomination for president -- Gabbard in 2020 and Kennedy in this election cycle before starting an independent bid.But these two are only the latest onetime opponents that Trump has pulled into his orbit. Many of Trump's Republican primary challengers from 2016 and 2024 became sycophants, some of them gushing over him at July's Republican National Convention. Some of his most vocal critics in Congress have become his confidants, like Sen. Lindsey Graham, who once called Trump a ""race-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot.""Even his own running mate, Sen. JD Vance, once wrote that the former president ""is cultural heroin"" and behind closed doors called him ""America's Hitler.""Trump embraces people who will swallow their words and bury their beliefs. He seems to like people to demonstrate that their convictions are hollow. To him, it seems obvious that those are people he can try to manipulate. They are the people he prefers, rather than those who tell him no.Trump is, above all, transactional, and in every transaction, he seeks leverage; once an opponent has bowed to him, he has the leverage he needs.A parade of former Trump administration officials has condemned him or refused to endorse him, but he and his supporters dismiss them as turncoats. In a certain light, they have a point: Trump hasn't changed. They knew -- or should have known -- who he was when they accepted their posts.Many Americans may not fully appreciate how much like ""Game of Thrones"" Washington politics is, how intoxicating political power can be, how proximity to that power orders society.I believe that part of the genius of Trump wasn't really genius at all but simply the clarity of an outsider who assessed and then exploited the cravenness of much of our political culture.He understood this social jockeying from experience: Trump is from New York, where he rose on the fringes of high society because he was too crass to be invited into it. His rise was propelled by, among other things, a hit television show, an assortment of cameo appearances in film and on television, a string of co-written books and being lionized in rap lyrics.In his political career, Trump has turned the Republican Party -- and much of Washington -- into his real-life game of ""The Apprentice,"" with various figures making expedient alliances, trying desperately to avoid elimination and all competing for his approval.Washington, to Trump, is a survivalist game, and in it, compromising oneself is a small price to pay for survival.In the end, in this game there are no victims. The pawns all play willingly. They abandon their morals and ethics of their own volition. They have seen the calamity Trump has brought to the lives of others who cross over to his side, yet they follow suit.On Sunday in an interview on Fox News, Kennedy said, ""I think President Trump is going to make a series of announcements about other Democrats who are joining his campaign, and you know, I want to make America healthy again, and so does President Trump.""Now, Kennedy blows a lot of smoke, but the idea that Trump would make America healthy again is too much to take. When it comes to literal health, he failed as president to take the Covid-19 pandemic seriously and tried his best to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Metaphorically, he threatens to reshape government as we know it -- something Kennedy seemed to recognize in 2020, when he said that in many ways, Trump ""discredited the American experiment with self-governance."" Ditto Gabbard, who once called him ""corrupt"" and ""unqualified to serve.""But they don't care about the obvious contradictions. They're playing the game. Trump wanted the fraction of support Kennedy drew this year and the imprimatur of a former Democratic congresswoman. In exchange, he'll grant them some marginal role and a trifle of power by association. Unless and until he takes it away: ""Ron DeSanctimonious,"" anyone?Washington, by some measures, is the most important city in the country. By others, it is the shallowest. Trump has exposed many of the city's players as apostates and built his Republican Party with these people at the core.","Ruben Navarrette: Donald Trump has surrounded himself with ideological shape- shifters.

A Neveda jury on Wednesday found former politician Robert Telles guilty of murdering Jeff German , a veteran Las Vegas journalist known for his investigative work and critical articles about Telles. German was stabbed to death outside his Las Vegas Valley home on September 3, 2022.Police and the jury concluded that Telles, who headed an office responsible for managing estates of individuals without heirs, was the attacker.Months before the attack, German wrote an article in The Las Vegas Review-Journal detailing allegations against Telles, including claims of a toxic work environment and an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. Telles lost his re-election bid soon after the article was published, and prosecutors argued that he targeted German as an act of revenge.Telles's defense lawyer, Robert Draskovich, argued that Telles was framed and the evidence was manipulated and portrayed German’s reporting as insufficient motive for murder .The country official had also denied his involvement and alleged a conspiracy involving corrupt businesspeople and a professional hitman. He claimed multiple parties, including law enforcement, were involved in framing him.However, Clark County chief deputy district attorney Pamela Weckerly said that the case was solely about the murder, not the political backdrop. “It’s just about murder,” she said, pointing to DNA evidence and video footage that linked Telles to the crime.Glenn Cook, executive editor of The Las Vegas Review-Journal, praised the jury’s decision and called it a measure of justice for Jeff German. Cook highlighted German’s dedication to holding public officials accountable and described him as a man who deeply valued his work and community, according to an AP report. Throughout his journalism career, German investigated many organized crime, political corruption, and various other major issues.","Jeff German was stabbed to death outside his Las Vegas Valley home on September 3, 2022.

The outlawed group insisted that it did not harm civilians while claiming that 800 of its well-trained fighters had participated in shootings and bombings that began late Sunday.However, addressing a cabinet meeting, prime minister Shehbaz Sharif said that there would be no peace talks with the group.Interacting with reporters in Quetta, interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said that a large-scale operation was not needed and the insurgents could be eliminated by police.Provincial chief minister Sarfraz Bugti said that the attack killed 53 people, including security forces, drawing nationwide condemnation. He further said that operations against the insurgents continued on Monday and “those who killed our innocent civilians and security will be dealt with with full force.”The PM said the Balochistan attacks sought to harm Chinese-funded development projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which included roads and rail systems to link western China’s Xinjiang region to Pakistan’s southwestern Gwadar port on the Arabian Sea.In recent years, BLA and other militants have also targeted Chinese nationals involved with CPEC projects.According to a witness, some killed in the latest attacks were ordered off local transport and shot.Sakina Nazir said that while traveling in a bus with her husband, gunmen signaled the driver to halt, following which, the men entered the bus and checked passengers' national identity cards. They called some people out, including her husband after which gunshots were heard by the survivors.Balochistan has long been the site of a prolonged insurgency, with various separatist groups launching attacks, targeting security forces.
