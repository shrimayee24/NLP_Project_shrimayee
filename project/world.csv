SC expands scrutiny radar to governors’ powers on bills,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-expands-scrutiny-radar-to-governors-powers-on-bills/articleshow/112055967.cms,"NEW DELHI: A week after agreeing to test the validity of blanket constitutional immunity from criminal prosecution to governors, the Supreme Court on Friday said it would consider framing guidelines for governors in withholding assent to Bills passed by legislature or referring them to the President .Opposition-ruled states Kerala and West Bengal on Friday joined Telangana and Tamil Nadu in accusing governors of whimsically exercising powers regarding Bills.Senior advocates K K Venugopal, A M Singhvi and Jaideep Gupta, appearing for Kerala and WB, argued in unison that it has become a trend with the governors to whimsically delay assent to Bills passed by legislative assembly and reserve them for the President’s consideration.A bench of CJI D Y Chandrachud, and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra issued notices to the Union ministry of home affairs and the secretaries the governors for a comprehensive exercise in interpretation of the relevant constitutional provisions relating to the powers of the governors regarding Bills.A week ago, the SC had entertained a petition by a woman, allegedly sexually harassed by WB governor C V Ananda Bose, to examine the constitutional validity of the immunity from criminal cases given to governors under Article 361 of the Constitution. The woman had alleged that the WB police was not investigating the case because of immunity enjoyed by the governor.Venugopal said, “There is a confusion in the minds of the governors as to what are their powers regarding assenting to bills. In Kerala, out of 8 bills, two have been kept pending for 23 months, one for 15 months, another for 13 months and three others for 10 months. This is a very sad state of affairs. The Constitution itself is being rendered otiose. We have also challenged his decision to refer some bills to the President.”For WB, Gupta said after the state gave notice of mentioning its petition before SC, the governor’s office has intimated that some of the Bills are reserved for President’s consideration. Singhvi, who had earlier appeared for TN and now argued on behalf of WB, said in Tamil Nadu too the same trend was witnessed. “The moment petitions are filed before the SC, the governor clears some bills and sends some to the President. The next date some more Bills are cleared. Why should the governor’s office act only when the petitions are listed for hearing in SC?Venugopal said, “Referring to the President seems to be an easy way out for the governor when they do not want to cooperate with the legislative assembly. It is an unfortunate state of affairs.”In the tussle between AAP government and Punjab governor over Bills, CJI Chandrachud-led bench had in its Nov 10, 2023 judgment said if unbridled power to sit over a Bill is given to “unelected head of State” in the governor, he would “virtually veto the functioning of the legislative domain by a duly elected legislature by simply declaring that assent is withheld without any further recourse”.“Such a course of action would be contrary to fundamental principles of a constitutional democracy based on a Parliamentary pattern of governance,” said Justice Chandrachud, who had authored the judgment. “The governor cannot be at liberty to keep the Bill pending indefinitely without any action whatsoever… The governor, as an unelected Head of the State, is entrusted with certain constitutional powers. However, this power cannot be used to thwart the normal course of lawmaking by the State Legislatures,” the SC had ruled.","Opposition-ruled states Kerala and West Bengal on Friday joined Telangana and Tamil Nadu in accusing governors of whimsically exercising powers regarding Bills.

Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has ignited a fresh controversy by claiming that he was misled into consenting to puberty blockers for his transgender child. In a recent interview with Jordan Peterson, Musk described the experience as a ""trick"" and blamed the ""woke mind virus"" for his son's transition.Musk's child, Xavier, who now identifies as Vivian Jenna Wilson, underwent a name and gender change in 2022.Musk asserts that he was pressured into approving puberty blockers for Xavier under false pretenses, claiming that he was told the child was at risk of suicide.""I lost my son, essentially. They call it deadnaming for a reason,"" Musk said. ""The reason it's called deadnaming is because your son is dead. My son Xavier is dead, killed by the woke mind virus.""After an extended pause, Musk added, ""I vowed to destroy the woke mind virus after that.""Musk's comments have sparked intense debate over parental rights, transgender healthcare, and the influence of cultural and political ideologies on personal decisions. Critics argue that Musk's statements are harmful and stigmatizing to transgender individuals, while supporters contend that he is raising legitimate concerns about the medical treatment of minors.The controversy comes amid broader cultural tensions over issues of gender identity and parental rights. Musk's decision to relocateSpaceX headquarters to Texas, citing a new California law limiting parental notification of a child's gender identity change, further underscores these divisions.Musk's pledge to take on the ""woke"" left likely inspired his latest decision to move the California headquarters for SpaceX to Texas, after Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill into law that will bar school districts from notifying parents if their child uses different pronouns or identifies as a gender that's different from what’s on school records.""This is the final straw,"" Musk wrote on X, his social media platform, in explaining his decision.

These fires have burned nearly 5 square miles of brush and timber in the Plumas National Forest near the Nevada line, roughly 50 miles northwest of Reno. Some evacuations were lifted Friday when containment reached 11%.In inland Southern California, firefighters battled a small fire that erupted Thursday afternoon in the hills above Lake Elsinore in Riverside County. The Macy Fire was 15% contained early Friday, with one unspecified structure destroyed.Meanwhile, in rural northern San Diego County, the containment of the 3-day-old Grove Fire jumped to 25% following a day of minimal growth.According to the National Interagency Fire Center, more than 27,000 fires have burned over 5,800 square miles in the US this year. In Canada, more than 3,700 fires have burned over 8,000 square miles so far, the National Wildland Fire Situation Report issued Wednesday stated.","The plane had been contracted by the US Bureau of Land Management and went missing near Seneca, on the edge of the Malheur National Forest.

'I’ve got nothing against cats': How JD Vance defended 'childless cat ladies' remark amid backlash; Watch video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jd-vance-defends-childless-cat-ladies-remark-amid-backlash-ive-got-nothing-against-cats/articleshow/112055445.cms,"""Profoundly Weird and Dangerous"": J.D. Vance Calls Out Media and Celebs Over Child Comments Backlash

Resurfacing controversy

Criticism and backlash

Senator JD Vance , recently announced as former President Donald Trump’s running mate, has defended his 2021 remarks disparaging Democratic leaders, including Vice President Kamala Harris, as “childless cat ladies” who “want to make the rest of the country miserable.”The comments resurfaced on social media following Trump’s announcement, drawing renewed attention and controversy .In response to the scrutiny, Vance appeared on The Megyn Kelly Show on Sirius XM on Friday, standing by his remarks. He described his comments as sarcastic but reaffirmed his belief that having children provides a different perspective on societal issues.“Obviously, it was a sarcastic comment. I’ve got nothing against cats, I've got nothing against dogs. I’ve got one dog at home and I love him.” Vance said. He added, “People are focusing so much on the sarcasm and not on the substance of what I actually said. The substance of what I said, Megyn — I'm sorry, it's true.”Vance dismissed the critiques as a distraction from the substance of his argument. “It’s not a criticism of people who don’t have children,” Vance clarified. “I explicitly said in my remarks that this is not about criticizing people who, for various reasons, don’t have kids. This is about criticizing the Democratic Party for becoming anti-family and anti-child.”He argued that his comments were aimed at the Democratic Party’s alleged shift away from family-oriented values. “What I was basically saying is that we’re effectively run in this country — via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs — by a bunch ofchildless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives,” Vance asserted.Vance also criticized media coverage of his comments, suggesting that the focus on the sarcastic nature of his remarks overshadowed their substance. “I know the media wants to attack me and wants me to back down, Megyn, but the simple point that I made is that having children — becoming a father, becoming a mother — I really do think it changes your perspective in a pretty profound way.”In a July 2021 interview with then-Fox News host Tucker Carlson, Vance criticized Democratic leaders, suggesting that their lack of children influenced their policies and attitudes toward the country. He described figures like Harris, Pete Buttigieg, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as “miserable” and lacking a “direct stake” in the country because they do not have children.“It’s just a basic fact — you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC — the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,” Vance had said.The comments sparked backlash, particularly given Harris’s role as a stepmother to her husband Doug Emhoff’s two children, Cole and Ella.Critics, including actress Jennifer Aniston and Ella Emhoff, challenged Vance’s characterization, with Ella responding on Instagram, “How can you be ‘childless’ when you have cutie pie kids like Cole and I? I love my three parents.”","Senator JD Vance was recently announced as former President Donald Trump’s running mate.

"Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada, alleged Mexican kingpin, pleads not guilty to US charges",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ismael-el-mayo-zambada-alleged-mexican-kingpin-pleads-not-guilty-to-us-charges/articleshow/112055238.cms,"Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada, the alleged co-founder of the Sinaloa Cartel , pleaded not guilty to US drug charges on Friday. Zambada and Joaquin Guzman Lopez, son of Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, were arrested in Texas, marking a dramatic achievement for US law enforcement that could impact Mexico's criminal landscape drastically.During an initial court appearance in Texas, Zambada, who is believed to be in his 70s and appeared in a wheelchair, was read his rights and charges.He directed a not guilty plea, which was accepted by US Magistrate Judge Anne Berton. Zambada waived his right to be present at an arraignment next Wednesday but must attend a status conference next Thursday before US District Judge Kathleen Cardone, who will oversee the case.Zambada's lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Zambada, believed to be one of Mexico's most influential traffickers, is accused of co-founding the Sinaloa Cartel with El Chapo. El Chapo was extradited to the US in 2017 and is serving a life sentence in a maximum security prison.Both Zambada and Guzman Lopez face charges in the United States for distributing large quantities of fentanyl and other drugs. Fentanyl overdoses have become the leading cause of death for Americans between the ages of 18 and 45.Guzman Lopez, in his 30s, is scheduled to appear in court in Chicago next week.The arrests occurred after the two landed in a private plane in the El Paso area on Thursday. Reuters first reported the story, followed by a Justice Department statement confirming their detention in El Paso.US President Joe Biden praised the arrests and committed to continuing the fight against drug trafficking .""Too many of our citizens have lost their lives to the scourge of fentanyl. Too many families have been broken and are suffering because of this destructive drug,"" he said in a statement.According to three current and former US officials, Guzman Lopez lured Zambada to the US. Drug lords have been key targets for US authorities, often resulting in plea bargain deals in exchange for information to capture other high-ranking cartel figures. However, Reuters could not confirm if a plea bargain deal had been made.Since their father’s extradition in 2017, El Chapo's sons and Zambada have had a fractious relationship. These arrests may trigger instability or violence in the cartel’s stronghold, Sinaloa. To bolster security, Mexico’s defense ministry dispatched 200 special forces soldiers to the state.In 2008, a violent inter-cartel war erupted when another senior Sinaloa leader was detained. His family accused El Chapo of orchestrating the arrest, leading to a fierce conflict between powerful cartel factions.Guzman Lopez is one of four sons of El Chapo, known as Los Chapitos or Little Chapos, who inherited their father’s faction. His brother, Ovidio Guzman Lopez, was arrested last year and extradited to the US.There were rumors circulating on social media that Ovidio Guzman had been released. However, US Ambassador to Mexico Ken Salazar confirmed he ""remains in custody in the United States.""In recent years, the Sinaloa Cartel has been the primary target for US authorities who accuse the syndicate of being the largest supplier of fentanyl to the US. The cartel traffics drugs to over 50 countries and is one of Mexico's two most powerful organized crime groups.Zambada's style contrasts sharply with that of El Chapo’s sons. Known for operating in the shadows, Zambada is seen as an ""old-school"" narco. El Chapo’s sons, in contrast, are known for being flashy, courting attention, and displaying more violent and hot-headed behavior.In Texas, Zambada faces charges including continuing criminal enterprise, narcotics importation conspiracy, and money laundering. An indictment filed in April 2012 alleges cartel members under Zambada and El Chapo kidnapped a Texas resident in 2009 due to a seized marijuana shipment and a US citizen and his family in 2010. Both victims were murdered, with their bodies discovered in Juarez, Mexico.Mexican security minister Rosa Rodriguez confirmed the US informed them of the detentions, but Mexican authorities did not participate.""The Mexican government did not participate in this detention or surrender,"" Rodriguez said at a press conference.It remains unclear whether the two men were captured or surrendered themselves to US authorities.","Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada and Joaquin Guzman Lopez, son of Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, were arrested in Texas.

Recent public opinion polls indicate that Harris is starting to close the gap with Trump's lead.According to a Wall Street Journal poll released on Friday, Trump holds a 49% to 47% lead over Harris, with a three-percentage-point margin of error. This marks a shift from the newspaper's earlier poll this month, which showed Trump leading Biden by 48% to 42%.Barack and Michelle Obama joined a growing list of prominent Democrats who rallied behind Harris' White House bid after Biden, at 81 years old, ended his reelection campaign due to pressure from the party. The Obamas expressed their pride in endorsing Harris and their commitment to supporting her throughout the election and into the Oval Office, as seen in an online video posted by the campaign.Harris, who would become the nation's first female president if she wins the November 5 election, expressed her gratitude for the endorsement and their long-standing friendship, saying, ""Thank you both. It means so much. And we're gonna have some fun with this too.""The Obamas remain highly popular figures within the Democratic Party, nearly eight years after leaving office. A Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted earlier this month revealed that 55% of Americans and 94% of Democrats view Michelle Obama favourably, surpassing Harris' national approval rating of 37% and her 81% approval within the party.The endorsement from the Obamas has the potential to boost support and fundraising for Harris' campaign, and it suggests that Barack Obama is likely to actively campaign on her behalf.","Former US President Donald Trump said he would return to Pennsylvania's Butler for a rally where he narrowly survived an assassination attempt.

Previous debate agreements

Former US President and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has announced that he will not engage in a debate with his Democratic rival , Vice President Kamala Harris , until the Democrats formally confirm their nominee. Trump’s decision comes despite Harris’s readiness to participate in a debate.“I have agreed to the previously agreed-upon September 10 debate,” Harris said at Joint Base Andrews upon her return from Houston.“He (Trump) agreed to that previously. Now here he is backpedaling, and I’m ready. The voters deserve to see the split screen that exists in this race on a debate stage.”Trump, who was officially declared the Republican nominee at the party’s convention in Milwaukee earlier this month, is awaiting the Democrats' formal decision on their nominee. Harris is expected to be declared the Democratic nominee at the party’s convention in Chicago in August.“Given the continued political chaos surrounding Crooked Joe Biden and the Democrat Party, general election debate details cannot be finalized until Democrats formally decide on their nominee,” said Trump Campaign Communications Director Steven Cheung in a late-night statement.Cheung further criticized Harris, suggesting that some in the Democratic Party, including former President Barack Obama, doubt her viability as a candidate. “There is a strong sense that Kamala Harris is a Marxist fraud who cannot beat President Trump,” Cheung said.Trump and President Joe Biden had previously agreed to two debates: one on June 27 and another on September 10. However, Biden’s poor performance in the June 27 debate, hosted by CNN, led him to withdraw from the race three weeks later. The September 10 debate was slated to be hosted by ABC News.Trump has expressed willingness to debate Harris, noting that he is not thrilled with ABC. “I want to debate her, and she’ll be no different because they have the same policies,” Trump said earlier this week. He also indicated a willingness to participate in more than one debate.In light of the recent changes, Fox News Media has proposed hosting a debate between Trump and Harris on September 17 in Pennsylvania. “Now that Vice President Kamala Harris is the presumptive Democratic nominee, FOX News Media is amending our proposal for a debate this cycle,” the network stated in letters sent to both campaigns.The proposal suggests holding the debate in Pennsylvania, a key battleground state, just as early voting begins.

A UAE court has jailed 57 Bangladeshi citizens to lengthy prison terms for protesting against the Sheikh Hasina government over the controversial quota decision .The Bangladeshi citizens were jailed as unauthorised protests are banned in the Gulf country.Commenting on the case, Amnesty International 's UAE researcher Devin Kenney said it was ""the second mass trial in the UAE this month, with dozens of people sentenced to huge prison terms literally overnight, on charges involving no element of violence"".In a statement to news agency AFP, Kenney said the UAE's ""extreme reaction to the mere existence of a public protest on Emirati soil shows that the state places great priority on suppressing any manifestation of dissent in the country.""Meanwhile, a Bangladeshi student leader on Monday called for a 48-hour halt to the protest against the quota decision, which embroiled the nation in deadly clashes resulting in the death of over 100 people.""We are suspending the shutdown protests for 48 hours,"" Nahid Islam, the top leader of the main protest organiser Students Against Discrimination, told news agency AFP. Nahid Islam demanded the government to ""withdraw the curfew, restore the internet and stop targeting thestudent protesters "" in the halt period.In what could be deciphered as a sign of ease, the halt comes a day after the Bangladesh Supreme Court scaled down the controversial quota decision of the Sheikh Hasina government that facilitated 30 per cent reservation in government jobs to descendants of 1971 war heroes, who fought for the Independent against Pakistani regime.As the situation appears to head towards normalcy, the Bangladesh police have arrested more than 500 people, including some opposition leaders, over days of clashes in the capital Dhaka.""At least 532 people have been arrested over the violence,"" Dhaka Metropolitan Police spokesman Faruk Hossain.""They include some BNP leaders,"" he added, referring to the opposition Bangladesh National Party.After days of deadly violence, normalcy returned to Bangladesh on Wednesday as factories, offices, and banks reopened following the easing of a nationwide curfew enforced by the army.

However, social media platforms remained suspended in the wake of student-led protests that turned violent last week.Despite the easing of restrictions, Zunaid Ahmed Palak, a junior technology minister, informed reporters that ""For now, all social media will remain shut,"" indicating that the government is still cautious about the potential for further unrest.","UAE court jails 57 Bangladeshi citizens to lengthy prison terms for protesting against the Sheikh Hasina government over the controversial quota decision.

The full report, made public by Sangamon County Coroner Jim Allmon, supports earlier findings that her death was a homicide.Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, representing Massey’s family, criticized the shooting as ""senseless, unnecessary, and excessive."" Crump highlighted the physical disparity between Massey and the now-fired deputy, Sean Grayson, during a press conference.The autopsy revealed that Massey, who was 5-foot-4 and 112 pounds, was shot just beneath her left eye, with the bullet exiting her lower neck in a downward trajectory.Grayson, who is white and stands 6-foot-3 and weighs 228 pounds, has pleaded not guilty to charges including first-degree murder and official misconduct. Fired from the Sangamon County Sheriff’s Office last week, he is currently being held without bond.Crump used an enlarged autopsy diagram to emphasize the physical mismatch between Grayson and Massey, arguing that her position at the time of the shooting—stooped and apologizing—demonstrates the excessive nature of the force used. “When Sonya Massey was staring at the barrel of his gun, she stooped down, said, ‘Sorry, sir, Sorry,’ and the bullet was shot while she was in this stooped position,” Crump said.Authorities reported that Massey had called 911 to report a suspected prowler. Two deputies responded to her Springfield home, located about 200 miles southwest of Chicago. Video footage confirmed that Grayson, aiming his 9mm pistol at Massey, threatened to shoot her in the face if she did not set down a pot of hot water. He fired three shots.After the shooting, Grayson reportedly dismissed the need for medical assistance, stating, “She done. You can go get it, but that's a head shot. There's nothing you can do, man."" Despite his initial refusal, the second deputy attempted to provide aid until emergency medical professionals arrived.Massey had a history of mental illness, and her family reported that she had recently entered and briefly exited a 30-day inpatient program in St. Louis. Her son, 17-year-old Malachi Hill Massey, mentioned that police had been called to their home the day before the shooting.

WASHINGTON: The Biden administration will "" calibrate "" its sanctions policy towards Venezuela depending on how the high-stakes unfolds in the OPEC nation on Sunday, US officials said, signaling that Washington could ease punitive measures if President Nicolas Maduro holds a fair vote.But the US also put Maduro on notice that if he claims victory without providing concrete proof, it would ""call into question"" whether the international community should accept the outcome.Maduro is seeking his third term as leader of Venezuela, which is under heavy US sanctions. His challenger, opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez, has attracted significant support.Maduro, a Socialist whose 2018 reelection in the South American nation was rejected by the US and most Western governments as a sham, has said Venezuela has the world's most transparent electoral system.The opposition and some independent observers have questioned whether Sunday's vote will be fair, saying decisions by Maduro-appointed electoral authorities and the arrests of some opposition campaign staff are meant to create obstacles.Senior US officials said on Friday they were closely watching the final lead-up to the election. Washington relaxed but then reinstated sanctions on Venezuela's vital oil industry in recent months after it said Maduro failed to comply with an electoral deal guaranteeing an inclusive democratic vote.The officials, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity, said they would not prejudge the outcome, but expressed concern about possible repression. They also warned Venezuela's military, which has long supported Maduro, not to interfere and ""put its thumb on the scale.""""The United States is prepared to calibrate our sanctions policy vis a vis events as they may unfold in Venezuela,"" one US official said. ""As we look at the post-electoral period, we will continue to evaluate and update our sanctions policy as required based on our foreign policy goals.""The officials did not cite any specific US steps but stressed that since the Venezuelan presidential inauguration is not scheduled until January, the response would likely play out over the rest of the year.They also declined to say whether Washington had crafted an action plan if the election is deemed to have been rigged by Maduro, except to say the administration was aware of ""multiple scenarios."" US sources have said a fraudulent result could lead to additional sanctions.Asked if Washington could drop criminal charges against Maduro to help negotiate a post-election exit, one official said if he loses, the US could ""consider measures that would facilitate a peaceful transition of power.""One official called it ""deeply concerning"" that Maduro's government had restricted international observers and urged it to reconsider, saying their presence would provide assurances of an election ""representative of the will of Venezuelan voters.""Gonzalez, a veteran former diplomat, inherited the opposition mantle from Maria Corina Machado, who enjoys wide popularity and won the opposition primary but was barred from holding public office.Maduro has presided over an economic collapse, the migration of about a third of the population, and a sharp deterioration in diplomatic relations, crowned by sanctions that have crippled an already-struggling oil industry.Gonzalez, 74, is known for his calm demeanor and has promised that political change could bring home many migrants.Analysts have suggested that a Maduro reelection or post-election upheaval could spur more Venezuelans to leave the country and head for the US-Mexico border.With immigration already a hot-button issue in the US presidential campaign, that could create new problems for Vice President Kamala Harris, seen as the likely Democratic nominee after President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid on Sunday.","The Biden administration will "" calibrate "" its sanctions policy towards Venezuela.

The Trump-Vance campaign has run into unexpected headwinds from the rousing start Kamala Harris has got for her campaign, powered by America's ""youngistan"".Polls are showing the presumptive Democratic nominee has enthused the younger voting demographic in America and has a stunning 20 point lead in the 18-34 age cohort.While most polls show the two locked in an almost deadheat in the overall demographic, with Trump leading by one or two points (within the margin of error), the closeness of the race is surprising pundits who thought Harris would be a pushover, particularly after the ex-prez survived an assassination bid.Although the attack occurred only a week ago, it seems to be fading from public memory.Word from the FBI that it is still investigating whether he was nicked by a bullet or shrapnel has enraged Trump, who insisted on Friday that ""a bullet that hit my ear, and hit it hard"". ""There was no glass, there was no shrapnel. The hospital called it a 'bullet wound to the ear,' and that is what it was. No wonder the once storied FBI has lost the confidence of America!"" he raged online. But there is plenty of political shrapnel flying out after liberals and never-Trumpers dug up old remarks in interviews by Trump's running mate JD Vance, including comments arguing that families with kids should get more political weightage than single people, who are ""obsessed with their jobs and status games"".Some Trump supporters are starting to express doubt about Vance as Trump's V-P pick, even going as far as to suggest he should be swapped for Nikki Haley, in part because of Harris and the likelihood of her choosing a white, male running mate.Harris' strong start and framing the race as ""Prosecutor v Felon"" appears to have rattled the Trump campaign , which has not come up with much beyond attacking her as a ""Marxist"".""My uncle is panicking. He's running against a strong black woman-and a former prosecutor-who isn't afraid to call him out or mock him. His whole campaign strategy was based around attacking Joe Biden-his age, his infirmity, his cognitive decline,"" Trump's niece and critic Mary Trump said. That line of attack has all but dissipated, and the shoe is now on the other foot, and a clumsy one at that - as the Harris campaign shared memes of him dancing awkwardly compared to her own sinuous moves.Adding to Trump's woes, one of his nephews, Fred Trump, is coming out with a book in which he says Trump once said after a White House meeting with families of disabled people that ""those kinds of people should just die"", because ""the shape they're in, all the expenses"". Fred himself has a special needs child and he claims his uncle told him, ""I don't know. He doesn't recognise you. Maybe you should just let him die and move down to Florida.""Critics have often said Trump lacks kindness or compassion, but coming from a family member, the outlook, combined with Vance's smackdown of single people, has put the campaign on the defensive.Such is the sudden disarray in the Trump camp that on Thursday he left himself open to taunts he famously dishes out to others after he backed away from a Sept 10 debate he had agreed to with the Democratic candidate (when it was expected to be Biden) - at least until Harris is confirmed as the Democratic nominee.""What happened to 'any time, any place'?"" Harris wrote on X.",The Trump-Vance campaign has run into unexpected headwinds from the rousing start Kamala Harris has got for her campaign.

"Obamas endorse Kamala, firing up campaign",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/obamas-endorse-kamala-firing-up-campaign/articleshow/112054875.cms,"Bibi meets Harris, Trump

WASHINGTON: The Obamas have come through for Kamala Harris. The former 'First Couple' - hugely influential among Democrats - formally endorsed her for the party nomination, saying they would ""do everything we can to elect Kamala Harris the next president of the United States.""In a video released by the Harris campaign of a phone call they made to her, ex-prez Barack Obama is heard saying, ""We called to say Michelle and I couldn't be prouder to endorse you and to do everything we can to get you through this election and into the Oval Office."" Michelle adds, ""I can't have this phone call without saying to my girl Kamala: I am proud of you.This is going to be historic."" ""Oh my goodness. Michelle, Barack, this means so much to me. I'm looking forward to doing this with the two of you, Doug and I both,"" Harris responds.The delay in the endorsement had set tongues wagging in the political circuit, particularly after speculation in some quarters about Michelle being better placed to defeat Trump. Harris herself was one of Obama's earliest supporters when he ran for the White House, working as a campaign volunteer when he kicked off his run in Iowa.Besides, for all the talk of them keeping a distance from Kamala, Obama is known to have a lot of respect and affection for her. Once, during a 2013 California fundraiser when he was prez, he called her the ""best-looking attorney general in the country"". He later phoned her to apologise after some feminists deemed the comment sexist, although Kamala did not seem to take offense. Now regarded as an elder statesman in the Democratic Party, the former prez had withheld an outright public endorsement for Kamala, reportedly because he did not want to ""put his thumb on the scale"" before Prez Biden had a chance to have his say after formally ceding the nomination.In a statement, the Obamas praised Kamala's accomplishments, pushing back against MAGA Republicans who have dubbed her a ""DEI hire"" - a reference to ""diversity, equity and inclusion"" initiatives. ""She has the vision, the character, and the strength,"" they wrote. ""There is no doubt in our mind that Kamala Harris has exactly what it takes to win this election... At a time when the stakes have never been higher, she gives us all reason to hope.""The Obamas' call adds to a surge of energy and momentum, Harris' campaign is experiencing after her dramatic elevation to the top of the ticket, powered in part by voters in the younger demographic who had despaired over two geriatrics duking it out for White House.US vice-prez Kamala Harris offered PM Netanyahu strong support for Israel's right to defend itself from terrorism Thursday but declared that ""far too many innocent civilians"" had died in the Gaza Strip and that ""I will not be silent"" about their suffering. Later, Netanyahu visited Donald Trump at his Florida resort, looking to patch things up. Trump was furious in 2020 after Netanyahu congratulated Biden on his victory in an election that the ex-prez claimed was stolen.

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took steps to restore their relationship on Saturday during a meeting at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate, marking their first meeting since Trump left the White House more than three years ago.The meeting, held at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate, comes amid heightened international scrutiny and pressure on Netanyahu over Israel’s military actions in Gaza .Trump, who has urged Israel to end the conflict quickly, emphasized his continued support for Israel and criticized Vice President Kamala Harris, calling her “radical” and unfriendly towards Israel. He also asserted that he would be a more steadfast ally to Israel than Harris.Netanyahu also expressed cautious optimism about progress toward a cease-fire deal for Gaza, as he neared the end of a contentious US visit that showcased growing American divisions over the Israeli-Hamas war.During his presidency, Trump supported Netanyahu by relocating the US embassy to Jerusalem and recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. He recently told Fox News that Israel should finish the war and expedite the return of hostages, criticizing Israel's public relations efforts.The former president and Republican nominee greeted Netanyahu warmly at his Mar-a-Lago estate, describing Harris as unfriendly towards Israel.Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, appeared to signal a shift in tone regarding the Israel-Gaza war after her meeting with Netanyahu on Thursday, where she vowed to “not be silent” about Palestinian suffering. In response, Trump labelled her comments as “disrespectful” and targeting her stance on an issue that has caused division within the Democratic party.“They weren’t very nice pertaining to Israel,” Trump remarked. “I actually don’t know how a person who is Jewish could vote for her, but that’s up to them.”Netanyahu, however, is under increasing international pressure regarding Israel’s military actions, and his trip aimed at solidifying support faced significant challenges.In a Fox News interview on Thursday, Trump criticized the prolonged conflict in Gaza, saying, “It can’t continue to go on like this. It’s too long. It’s too much.” Harris and President Joe Biden, who also met with Netanyahu on Thursday, reiterated their call for a ceasefire to facilitate the release of hostages held by Hamas.Meeting face-to-face for the first time in nearly four years, Netanyahu and Trump discussed US-mediated efforts for a cease-fire and the release of hostages. ""I hope so,"" Netanyahu said when asked if his US trip had made progress.At home, Netanyahu faces increasing accusations of resisting a deal to end the 9-month-old war to avoid the potential collapse of his far-right government. ""I’m certainly eager to have one. And we’re working on it,"" he added.Netanyahu, without directly criticizing Harris, said that a ceasefire would be achievable only if Hamas recognized the unity between Israel and the United States, expressing hope that Harris's comments would not disrupt this perception.Trump, reiterating his long-standing support for Israel, questioned how Jewish Americans could vote for Harris, saying, “I actually don’t know how a person who’s Jewish can vote for her, but that’s up to them.”Trump also warned of the rising threat of a third world war, emphasizing his belief that only he could prevent it. “You are closer to a third world war right now than at any time since the Second World War,” he claimed.Trump, who as president had strongly supported Netanyahu’s policies, saw relations sour after Netanyahu quickly congratulated Joe Biden on his 2020 presidential victory over Trump. However, both leaders now seek to revive their alliance for the political support and conservative luster it brings.A beaming Trump greeted Netanyahu on the stone steps of his Palm Beach estate, warmly clasping the Israeli leader’s hands. ""We’ve always had a great relationship,"" Trump told journalists. Asked if Netanyahu’s visit was repairing their bond, Trump responded, ""It was never bad.""For both leaders, Friday’s meeting was an opportunity to present themselves as strong leaders capable of significant achievements on the world stage. Netanyahu's Florida trip followed a fiery address to Congress, defending his government’s conduct of the war and condemning American protesters reacting to the conflict’s toll on Palestinian lives.Despite their past alignment, Trump was reportedly irked by Netanyahu’s congratulations to Biden after the 2020 election, which Trump falsely claims was stolen. Recently, Trump has softened his criticism of Netanyahu, especially following the October 7 attack on Israel.US officials indicate that negotiations with Hamas are nearing a deal, with Netanyahu hinting at a possible resolution. However, significant differences remain, particularly regarding the timing and conditions for ending the war. Israel’s defense agencies are concerned that Netanyahu’s new demands, including stringent security screenings, might jeopardize the ceasefire negotiations.In Washington, Netanyahu met with President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, who pressed him to finalize a cease-fire and release hostages held by Hamas. Trump’s campaign said he pledged to ""make every effort to bring peace to the Middle East"" and combat antisemitism on college campuses if elected president.Netanyahu presented Trump with a framed photo of a child held hostage by Hamas since the war's outset. ""We’ll get it taken care of,"" Trump assured him.The meeting allowed Trump to bolster his image as a statesman and ally of Israel, emphasizing the Republican Party’s loyalty to the nation amid growing American divisions over support for the Israeli-Hamas conflict.For Netanyahu, repairing ties with Trump is critical given the possibility of Trump’s return to the presidency, which would be vital for Israel's arms supply and protection. Netanyahu might also seek better terms in a Gaza cease-fire and normalization deal with Saudi Arabia by waiting out the Biden administration, hoping for a Trump victory.""Benjamin Netanyahu has spent much of his career in the last two decades in tethering himself to the Republican Party,"" said Aaron David Miller, a former US diplomat for Arab-Israeli negotiations. For the next six months, that means ""mending ties with an irascible, angry president,"" he added, referring to Trump.Netanyahu and Trump last met at a 2020 White House signing ceremony for a significant diplomatic achievement: the normalization accords between Israel, the UAE, and Bahrain. This historic agreement marked a major step toward easing regional tensions and broadening economic ties with Arab neighbors.In public statements following their fallout, Trump has criticized Netanyahu’s handling of the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks and other issues. However, in his speech to Congress and again at Mar-a-Lago, Netanyahu praised Trump for historic regional accords and long-sought actions by Israel, such as US recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights and declaring Jerusalem as Israel's capital.""I appreciated that,"" Trump told ""Fox & Friends"" on Friday, referring to Netanyahu’s praise. Trump has urged Israel to ""finish the job"" in Gaza and destroy Hamas, though he has not detailed how this should be achieved.","Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu met at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate on Saturday.

It's all gonna work out, and very quickly. If we don't, you could end up with major wars in the Middle East and maybe a third world war.""Following the meeting, Trump's campaign issued a statement pledging his commitment to fostering Middle East peace and combating anti-Semitism on US college campuses upon his return to the White House. The interaction between Trump and Netanyahu at Mar-a-Lago resort was marked by a warm reception, with Netanyahu displaying a hat bearing the words ""TOTAL VICTORY,"" signaling his determination to overcome Hamas in Gaza.In stark contrast, Netanyahu's meeting with Vice President Kamala Harris the previous day involved Harris urging the prime minister to secure a peace deal in Gaza and expressing her refusal to remain silent on the Palestinian enclave's suffering. Harris said, ""What has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating. The images of dead children and desperate hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time."" Trump criticized Harris, labeling her as a ""radical left person"" and deeming her comments ""disrespectful"" towards Israel.The past nine months have witnessed significant casualties resulting from Israeli operations against Hamas in Gaza. In October, a surprise attack by Hamas led to the loss of 1,197 lives in Israel, primarily civilians. Israel's retaliatory measures have claimed the lives of more than 39,175 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, which does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths.Netanyahu's relationship with Trump has been notably warmer compared to his interactions with President Biden. The Israeli leader has faced disagreements with the Biden administration on various issues, including civilian casualties in Gaza and the pace of US weapons deliveries to Israel. During his address to Congress, Netanyahu acknowledged both Biden and Trump, emphasizing the actions taken by the former president during his tenure, such as recognizing Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights, confronting Iran's aggression, and recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital while relocating the American embassy there.","Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met in Florida on Friday.

A 17-year-old boy was accused on Friday of intentionally causing a train derailment in Bennet, Nebraska , on April 21, to capture and post the incident on YouTube . After a BNSF Railway investigator secured a search warrant on July 8, authorities confiscated the teenager’s cell phone and 4k digital recorder in connection to the derailment that resulted in two locomotives and five rail cars going off the tracks, though they remained upright, according to a report by Metro UK.According to a train conductor’s account to a BNSF special agent, the eastbound locomotive was nearing a crossing when he observed a misaligned switch diverting the train onto an industry track by a grain elevator. Despite efforts to initiate an emergency stop, the train crashed before reaching the switch. The investigator later discovered that a switch lock was missing, indicating tampering.At the derailment scene, a 17-year-old approached and inquired about the incident, claiming to have recorded the crash on his mobile phone, as detailed in the affidavit. When officials said they were unsure of the cause, the boy responded, ""Obviously a switch was flipped the wrong way,"" according to court records obtained by KOLN.Three days post-crash, a BNSF investigator reviewed CCTV footage revealing a 1996 Buick Park Avenue in the vicinity, with the same teen walking toward the switch on the south end of the tracks. The footage then captured the teen returning to his vehicle. Further CCTV evidence showed the teen driving south on Monroe Street, parking, and setting up a tripod, suggesting he was preparing to record the derailment.Shortly afterward, the derailment was recorded, and a video was uploaded to a YouTube account potentially linked to the teen, as noted by the investigator.The teen is accused of criminal mischief causing damages over $5,000 pursuant to a search warrant. However, formal charges had not been filed immediately. Due to his juvenile status, the teen's identity has not been disclosed, and he is not in detention.""My office will file a motion to transfer the case to adult court and it will be up to the juvenile court Judge to transfer the case or have it remain in juvenile court,"" Lancaster County Attorney Patrick Condon told McClatchy News.The incident resulted in approximately $350,000 in damages to BNSF and Omaha Public Power District property.","A 17-year-old boy was accused on Friday of intentionally causing a train derailment in Bennet, Nebraska, to capture and post the incident on YouTube.

Hundreds of PTI workers and senior leaders were arrested for their involvement in the violence and attacks on military installations, including the Jinnah House, ISI building in Faisalabad, and General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi.Maryam also accused the PTI of conspiring to default the country, writing letters to the International Monetary Fund, waving cipher messages, and disrespecting memorials as part of a larger plot. She called for strict action against the PTI under the Constitution and law, citing national security and interests.The chief minister further criticized the PTI for alienating friendly countries, making baseless accusations against the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), and disrupting Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit in 2014 by staging a sit-in. She recounted PTI's previous attacks on Parliament, PTV, and the Prime Minister's house, and accused them of violence against police officers and desecrating the Supreme Court's walls.In March, Minister for Information and Broadcasting Ataullah Tarar said that a handful of ""miscreants"" associated with the PTI were bent upon sabotaging Pakistan's deal with the IMF, which he said was crucial for economic stability.He said that at the protest, activists belonging to PTI were urging the IMF to give funds to Pakistan only if their jailed leader was released, regretting that activists of an ""anti-national"" party continued to hold sit-ins and protests outside the IMF offices. He said the protesters only wanted to sabotage the IMF deal because their dream was to make Pakistan default.","Maryam Nawaz, the daughter of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, has accused Imran Khan of orchestrating attacks on government buildings and military installations.

"Anti-terrorism efforts being made controversial by illegal, political mafias, says Pak army",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/anti-terrorism-efforts-being-made-controversial-by-illegal-political-mafias-says-pak-army/articleshow/111937180.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan armyaccused its criticsof “politicising” its anti-terrorism efforts , including a new military operation, to the detriment of the country’s national interests following the arrest on Monday of Raoof Hasan, information secretary of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), headed by jailed former prime minister Imran Khan. The army said the party information secretary was in charge of PTI ’s digital media cell which, it alleged, was involved in running anti-state propaganda.Last month PM Shehbaz Sharif had approved a military offensive to counter aspikein terrorist attacks across Pakistan, particularly in volatile northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and southwestern Balochistan provinces, but the idea was widely criticised by opposition parties, particularly PTI and the rights group Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM). They termed it a ploy against Pashtuns to earn dollars from major powers and exploit their resources.Addressing a presser in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, the military’s spokesperson, Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, asked, “Why did a mafia, a political mafia , and an illegal mafia say that they would not let this campaign (OperationAzm-e-Istehkam, or Resolve for Stability) happen?” He added that opponents of the offensive had tried to make it “controversial” and paint it as a purely military operation in which thousands of people would be displaced.He did not name any party or group butcalled the army’s critics “politicalandillegal mafias”,an apparent reference to PTI and PTM.Lt Gen Chaudhry said they were using “fake news and propaganda” to spread lies about the army and its intentions.“This is digital terrorism,” he said. “The physical terrorist also attacks law enforcement agencies and the army, and the digital terrorist also attacks the army. They are doing the same thing.”“Digital terrorists”, the spokesman said, would be deterred through laws, regulation and monitoring.He, however, questioned the lack of action against such individuals despite their activities against the leadership of the state and other institutions. “Instead of the courts and regulations moving forward against them, they’re given further space and they’re made heroes in the name of freedom of expression,” he said.Ahead of Sharif’s press conference, security forces had raided PTI’s offices and arrested Raoof Hasan from the party’s central secretariat. The raid came a week after the govt had said it planned to ban the party.“The PTI digital media centre had become a centre of international disinformation, from where anti-Pakistan propaganda is run throughout the world,” Islamabad police said, adding that those directly involved in anti-national propaganda were arrested and all evidence from PTI’s digital media cell wasconfiscated.The party issued a statement on X, saying: “It’s absolutely shameful how Islamabad police continues to completely mock and disregard every law in this country. Law of the jungle is reigning over Pakistan!”The crackdown on PTI follows several court rulings in its favour this month that threaten PM Sharif’s govt, which came to power in Feb this year with the military’s backing.","Pakistan army accuses its criticsof “politicising” its anti-terrorism efforts.

Warning shot: Pakistan army puts politicians on notice for 'sabotaging' major anti-terror op,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/warning-shot-pakistan-army-puts-politicians-on-notice-for-sabotaging-major-anti-terror-op/articleshow/111934063.cms,"Precursor to army intervention?



The Pakistan army on Monday accused an "" illegal political mafia "" of trying to sabotage its renewed military operation, codenamed "" Azm-i-Istehkam "" (Resolve for Stability), against rising terrorism in the country.Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) director general Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif, in a press conference in Rawalpindi, stated that a ""massive, illegal political mafia"" has risen to undermine the operation due to ""vested interests"".Sharif clarified that Azm-i-Istehkam is not just a military operation but a comprehensive counter-terrorism campaign launched through national consensus to reinvigorate the already in-place National Action Plan (NAP).He stressed that the purpose of the operation is to eliminate terrorism, which will eventually lead to ""societal and national uplift"".However, the DG ISPR accused a ""very strong lobby"" of having a vested interest in sabotaging the operation, as it does not want the NAP to succeed.He alleged that this entity is receiving a lot of money to subvert the operation.""The stakes in [sabotaging] this operation are very high, and it's not based on any ideology but involves a lot of money,"" he said.Lt Gen Sharif stated that the ""illegal political mafia"" made the first move to make the operations controversial through false and fake arguments.He pointed out that the problem lies in the implementation of the NAP's other points, such as the regularisation and registration of religious seminaries, where only a bit over 16,000 out of about 32,000 seminaries have been registered so far. He questioned whether the army should be responsible for these tasks.The DG ISPR also mentioned the issue of the ""illegal spectrum"", which hides a major illegal economy through which the criminal system and terrorism operate. He said the requirement of the illegal spectrum is a ""soft state"" and the solution to it is the National Action Plan.While the DG ISPR's statements highlight the challenges faced by the government in implementing its counter-terrorism strategy, it is essential to note that the army's involvement in political matters can be a sensitive issue.The military has historically played a significant role in the country's politics, and its direct intervention in political affairs has often been a subject of controversy.It remains to be seen whether the army will take a more active role in the country's affairs in response to the alleged sabotage of the counter-terrorism campaign by the ""illegal political mafia"".","Pakistan army accuses an ""illegal political mafia "" of trying to sabotage its renewed military operation.
