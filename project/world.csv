"‘He gave up life to save others’, says wife of Captain who died in Siachen fire; receives Kirti Chakra",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/had-a-long-chat-about-our-future-having-kids-next-day-he-died/articleshow/111547704.cms,"NEW DELHI: “He is a hero. He gave up his life to save others,” said an inconsolable Smriti Singh, the widow of Captain Anshuman Singh, while she stood before President Droupadi Murmu with folded hands to accept the Kirti Chakra , India’s second-highest gallantry honour, awarded posthumously to her husband on Friday for saving his fellow men's lives and trying to protect critical medical equipment during a fire incident at an Army dump on the world’s highest battlefield, the Siachen Glacier.Captain Singh was posted with the 26th Battalion of the Punjab Regiment as a medical officer at Siachen. On July 19, 2023, an ammunition dump caught fire in the dead of night. The Captain saw a fibreglass hut engulfed in flames and quickly acted to save those trapped inside. He successfully rescued several individuals, but while trying to save critical medical equipment from a medical investigation centre that also caught fire, he laid down his life.The Rashtrapati Bhavan statement said: “Disregarding his own safety, Captain Anshuman Singh exhibited exceptional bravery and resolve to rescue many people during a major fire incident in Siachen. He was awarded the Kirti Chakra (posthumously) for his act of conspicuous gallantry and sacrifice.” Smriti Singh, along with the Captain’s mother Manju Singh, received the award from the President.After receiving the Kirti Chakra, Smriti Singh, in a video posted by a defense ministry spokesperson, recalled, “He once told me, ‘I would die with the brass on my chest. I would not die an ordinary death’.”Recalling her first meeting with Captain Singh, Smriti said, “We met on the first day of college. I don’t want to be dramatic, but it was love at first sight. After a month, he got selected into the Armed Forces Medical College (AFMC). We met at an engineering college, but then he got selected for medical college. Super intelligent guy. From then on, after just one month of meeting, it was a long-distance relationship for eight long years.”“Then we decided to get married. Unfortunately, within two months of our marriage, he got posted to Siachen,” she said.“On July 18, we had a long conversation about how our life was going to be in the next 50 years. We would build a house, have kids... On the morning of July 19, I got a call that he was no more. For the next 7-8 hours, we were not ready to accept that anything of this sort had happened. Now that I have the Kirti Chakra in my hand, maybe it is true. It’s okay; he’s a hero. We can manage our lives. But he gave his life to save the other three families, his army family,” Smriti said, trying to hold back her tears.After the incident last year, Captain Singh was cremated with full state honours in Bhagalpur in UP’s Deoria district, on July 22, 2023.President Murmu also presented 26 Shaurya Chakras, including seven posthumously, to personnel of the armed forces, Central Armed Police Forces, and state/UT police during a defence investiture ceremony.","Captain Anshuman Singh was posted with the 26th Battalion of the Punjab Regiment as a medical officer at Siachen.

Akshata Murthy's Heartwarming Gesture For Rishi Sunak As He Walks Out Of UK PM House | Watch

LONDON: Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer became the new prime minister of Britain on Friday, promising a “national renewal” after leading his party to a landslide victory, winning more than 400 of the 650 seats in the general election and bringing Labour back to power after 14 years in opposition. “Our work is urgent and we begin it today,” Starmer said.Labour had 412 votes and two seats were left to be declared at the time of going to press.Outgoing British Indian PM Rishi Sunak (44), who led the Conservatives, Britain’s oldest political party, to their worst electoral defeat in its nearly 200-year history, losing 250 seats (and winning 121), gave his resignation speech outside Downing Street in which he apologised to the country. He said he had given the job his all but the country had sent a clear signal that the govt must change. His wife, Akshata Murty, stood behind him in a blue-and-white striped dress looking close to tears. He will go down in history as the least successful UK PM at the ballot box.“I have heard your anger, your disappointment and I take responsibility for this loss,” he said. He then held Murty’s hand as they walked to the car to travel to Buckingham Palace for him to formally tender his resignation as PM to King Charles, the head of state, after his gamble of calling the early election failed spectacularly.Shortly after midday Starmer (61), who had called for the abolition of the monarchy when younger, went to Buckingham Palace to meet the King, accompanied by his wife Victoria in a red dress, where he was formally asked to form a Labour govt and appointed prime minister. It is the first time in more than 60 years that a knight of the realm will take up the office of prime minister.Starmer arrived in Downing Street to loud cheers and supporters waving Union Jacks where he gave his first speech as PM, first paying tribute to Sunak for being the UK’s first British Asian PM and for his dedication and hard work. But he said: “Our country has voted decisively for change” and “a return of politics to public service”. He said his govt would “restore service and respect to politics”. For too long the previous govt had turned a blind eye as millions slid into insecurity, he said.“We will govern country first, party second,” he said and promised to create wealth in every community, get the NHS back on its feet, and secure the borders.His first foreign visit will be to Washington on Tuesday, for the Nato Summit. Apart from his wife and two children, there will be another entrant to Downing Street, Starmer’s cat, Jojo, a rescue, who is expected to have turf wars with Larry, the No. 10 cat.On Friday morning white vans had already appeared outside Downing Street so that Sunak could move out.The night brought a string of high-profile Conservative casualties. Liz Truss, the former PM,lost her seat. Setting another record, eight cabinet ministerslost their seats, including defence secretary Grant Shapps, justice secretary Alex Chalk, and Leader of the House of Commons Penny Mordaunt.Another party which had suffered a crushing defeat was the pro-Scottish independence SNP which lost 38 seats in Westminster and were left with just nine seats.The election also saw big wins for the Liberal Democrats, Reform UK and Independents. The Liberal Democrats picked up 71 seats, also seizing three seats of former Tory PMs Theresa May, David Cameron and Boris Johnson .Reform UK, a brand new party set up by pro-Brexit and anti-immigration Nigel Farage, won four seats and came second to Labour in many seats. It was widely blamed for causing the Tories to lose as many seats as it did by splitting the Conservative vote. Farage himself entered the House of Commons for the first time, on his eighth attempt.The Green party won four seats. Five Independents also wonseats. Jeremy Corbyn, former Labour leader,won Islington North, standing against Labour, with a majority of 7,247. India-origin Praful Nargund had stood against him for Labour and lost with 16,873 votes. Labour frontbencher Jonathan Ashworth suffered a surprise defeat in Leicester South to Independent Shockat Adam, a 51-year-old local. Adam, who like many in the city has Indian roots, has lived in Leicester since the age of three when his family moved from Malawi to England.In Blackburn Independent Adnan Hussain overturned an 18,000 Labour majority to win by just 132 votes. City councillor Ayoub Khan won Birmingham Perry Barr, unseating Labour’s most senior British Pakistani MP, Khalid Mahmood, who had been MP since 2001.Independent candidate Iqbal Mohamed, whose parents arrived in the UK from India in the 1960s, gained Dewsbury and Batley from Labour. All five Independents were endorsed by a collective called Muslim Vote, which is campaigning for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.George Galloway’s Workers Party of Britain failed to secure a single seat and he lost his own seat of Rochdale.",Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer becomes the new prime minister of Britain on Friday.

Licence mandatory to set up stalls on private land in Maharashtra's Lonavla,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/licence-mandatory-to-set-up-stalls-on-private-land-in-maharashtras-lonavla/articleshow/111558585.cms,"Picturesque view of Lonavla

PUNE: The Lonavla Municipal Council (LMC) has made it mandatory to take permission to set up stalls on private land at picnic spots in and around Lonavla for the safety of visitors .The move comes as the administration has taken a series of measures after the death of five people near Bhushi dam last week. LMC officials believe hawkers are likely to set up stalls on private land after their illegal stalls on the railway land near Bhushi dam were razed last week.Permission for hawkers would be given only for spits that would not hamper vehicular movement.“Crowd management is imperative, considering the increasing number of visitors in the monsoon period. After the demolition of stalls near the dam, private players may try to take advantage of the situation. So, we have taken the decision to keep a check,” said Ashok Sable, chief officer of LMC.Sable said the civic body is not against stall owners but wishes to regularise their activities. “We want to maintain the situation. The safety and security of visitors is essential for us,” he said.LMC officials said private operators had been illegally running their businesses near the dam for decades. Now, they are not ready to follow the rules.“They earned good revenue from these stalls but did not give any revenue to LMC in the past. Now, they should not hesitate to pay charges to the council and abide by the rules,” a senior official from LMC said.The police provided protection to the civic body during the anti-encroachment drive.“The LMC should issue licences to those who will not cause any trouble to tourists at these spots. Eventually, it should create a conducive atmosphere for visitors and regulating agencies. We endeavour to promote safe and secure tourism in Lonavla,” said a senior police officer. Thousands of revellers, mainly from Mumbai, visit spots in and around Lonavla during the monsoon every year.","The move comes as the administration has taken a series of measures after the death of five people near Bhushi dam last week.

Political reactions

Public sentiment

(With inputs from agencies)

The final results of the high-stakes legislative elections in France, announced early Monday, revealed that a coalition of the French Left emerged victorious, securing the most seats in parliament. However, they fell short of achieving a majority, despite successfully fending off a surge from the far-right. This outcome has left France facing the alarming possibility of a hung parliament, which could lead to political paralysis in a country that is not only a cornerstone of the European Union but also the host of the upcoming Olympic Games.The potential consequences of this situation are far-reaching, as it may unsettle markets and the French economy, which is the second-largest in the EU.Moreover, it could have significant implications for the ongoing war in Ukraine, global diplomacy, and the economic stability of Europe as a whole.The results were also a blow for centrist President Emmanuel Macron , who called the snap election to clarify the political landscape after his ticket took a battering at the hands of the RN in European Parliament elections last month.Meanwhile, violence has erupted on the streets of France following the poll results. Disturbing videos depict hooded and masked demonstrators rampaging through the streets, igniting flares and setting parts of France on fire. The authorities had deployed 30,000 riot police nationwide in anticipation of heightened political tensions, a Daily Mail report said.Similar scenes unfolded in Nantes, where protesters clashed with law enforcement. Reports indicate that several demonstrators were arrested, and numerous injuries were sustained on both sides. The protest in Nantes mirrored the intensity and grievances seen in the capital, the Daily Mail report said.Political figures have weighed in on the situation. Marine Le Pen , leader of the National Rally party, commented on the protests, saying, ""The government's inability to address the people's concerns is evident in these violent clashes."" Her remarks have sparked further debate on the effectiveness of current government policies.Public sentiment remains divided, with some supporting the protesters' cause and others condemning the violence. A local resident in Paris shared, ""While I understand the frustration, resorting to violence is not the solution. It only leads to more harm and destruction.""Authorities are urging for calm and dialogue to resolve the issues at hand. As the situation develops, the government is expected to announce measures to address the protesters' demands and restore order.","A coalition of the French Left emerged victorious, securing the most seats in parliament.

LONDON: Only one Indian-origin MP , Lisa Nandy, has made it onto the new British prime minister ’s cabinet despite there being 19 PIO MPs in the Labour party now.This is a stark contrast to the cabinet Boris Johnson had formed in July 2019 which was the most diverse in British history. Meanwhile British Pakistani MP Shabana Mahmood, who has been strongly critical of the Indian govt over Kashmir, has been appointed justice secretary.Manchester-born half-Indian Lisa Nandy (44), a former leadership rival to Starmer, is now secretary of state for culture, media and sport. She has previously held several shadow cabinet roles, including shadow foreign secretary. In Sept 2023 Starmer had demoted her to shadow cabinet minister for international development. Her father is Dipak Nandy, a Kolkata-born academic who lives in the UK and helped draft Labour’s 1976 race relations bill. Her mother is Ann Luise Byers, daughter of the late life peer Lord Byers. She quit as a frontbencher when Jeremy Corbyn was Labour leader in June 2019, alongside many other shadow cabinet members, calling for him to step down as leader.Preet Kaur Gill, once the shadow international development secretary, is not in the new cabinet.Mahmood, who was shadow justice secretary in Opposition, made a speech at an Independence Day protest on Aug 15, 2019 outside the Indian high commission in London which turned violent and left the mission’s building severely damaged. She had signed a letter to Johnson in 2019 calling on him to “strongly condemn the actions of the Indian govt” and its allegedly “illegal and unconstitutional revocation of Article 370 to annex Kashmir”.was born in Birmingham and her parents were born in the village of Bab-e-yaam in Mirpur, PoK. She supports the right of the Kashmiri people to self-determination and has condemned India’s actions in Kashmir many times in tahe House of Commons. She has called for independent observers to be sent to the region.In July 2029 Johnson gave three cabinet positions to MPs of Indian origin — Priti Patel, Rishi Sunak and Alok Sharma. Other ethnic minorities in that cabinet included James Cleverly, Sajid Javid and Kwasi Kwarteng.Trupti Patel, president of the Hindu Forum of Britain, said: “I feel the cabinet should be appointed on merit. It is the work it carries out that matters. Rishi got the job as chancellor because he was the best person for the job. I don’t believe in positive discrimination.”Sunder Katwala, director of think tank British Future, said: “Keir Starmer has less ethnic diversity at the top table. Three of his Cabinet are black and Asian. This now seems low after the previous administration, though it is only a little behind the 14% of the electorate who are from visible minorities.”","Only one Indian-origin MP has made it onto the new British prime minister ’s cabinet.

He secured the win by pledging to engage with the West and relax the enforcement of the country's compulsory headscarf law , following a period of sanctions and protests that have strained the Islamic Republic. Pezeshkian's opponent, hard-liner Saeed Jalili , was defeated in the electoral contest.Pezeshkian secured over 17 million votes, while Jalili obtained more than 13 million votes in an election where approximately 30 million votes were cast, according to Iran's election authority. The voter turnout for this election, which was at historic low level, stood at 49.8 percent.Throughout his campaign, Pezeshkian refrained from promising any drastic changes to Iran's Shiite theocracy. He has consistently recognized Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as the ultimate authority in all matters concerning the state.However, Pezeshkian's modest objectives are likely to face challenges from an Iranian government that remains largely controlled by hard-liners, the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict in the Gaza Strip, and Western concerns about Tehran's enrichment of uranium to near-weapons-grade levels.In the early hours of the day, Pezeshkian's supporters, took to the streets in Tehran and other urban areas as his advantage over Jalili, a conservative former nuclear negotiator, continued to grow.The initial round of polling on June 28 experienced the poorest participation since the 1979 Islamic Revolution in the history of the Islamic Republic. The leadership in Iran has consistently stressed that the voter turnout is an indication of backing for the nation's Shiite theocracy, which has been under pressure following years of economic sanctions, widespread protests, and severe repression of all dissent.According to the vote count provided by the authorities, Pezeshkian secured 16.3 million votes, while Jalili received 13.5 million votes in Friday's election.The elections came after President Ebrahim Raisi, who was widely regarded as a close confidant and mentee of Khamenei, died in a helicopter accident in May. Many believed that Raisi was being groomed as a possible successor to the supreme leader position.Raisi's legacy was however, marred by his participation in the 1988 mass executions in Iran. Furthermore, he played a significant role in the violent suppression of protests that erupted following the death of Mahsa Amini in 2022 who had been arrested by the authorities for allegedly wearing her mandatory hijab improperly.","Masoud Pezeshkian, a reformist candidate and heart surgeon, emerged victorious in Iran's runoff presidential election on Saturday.

His dismal debate performance was attributed to his cold and long international trips to deflect discussion around his health and age. He gave more interviews in damage control but to achieve little as it was reported that the questions in those interviews were framed by the White House.","Republican senator Tommy Tuberville told on Fox New that it is widely known that Joe Biden is not in charge of the country and Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, former president Barack Obama -- along with the 'Deep State' -- are calling the shots.

Schiff emphasised that given Biden's impressive record and Trump's criminal history, the President should be easily defeating his opponent. However, he attributed the close race to Biden's age.“Given Joe Biden’s incredible record, given Donald Trump’s terrible record, he should be mopping the floor with Donald Trump .Joe Biden is running against a criminal. It should not be even close,” Schiff said.Schiff's comments come amidst growing concerns about Biden's vitality following his recent debate against Trump. Despite calls from five House Democrats for Biden to withdraw from the race, the President has remained adamant about staying in the running, saying that only the ""Lord Almighty"" could persuade him otherwise.The stakes of the November 5th election have been further heightened by a recent Supreme Court decision granting sitting presidents absolute immunity for official acts. Schiff warned that this ruling could give the next occupant of the Oval Office ""nearly dictatorial power."" He stressed that Biden must either win overwhelmingly or pass the torch to someone who can.“Either he has to win overwhelmingly, or he has to pass the torch to someone who can,” Schiff said.While praising Biden's accomplishments as president, including job creation, strengthening Nato alliances, and tackling climate change, Schiff expressed concern over Biden's recent interview with ABC News.In the interview, Biden downplayed his debate performance and suggested that he would be content as long as he gave it his all. Schiff found this response troubling, emphasizing that the decision to run or pass the torch should not be based solely on effort.Schiff also highlighted the potential impact of Biden's performance on down-ballot races, noting that while Senate and House candidates are currently ahead, they can only run so far ahead of the President. Without explicitly stating what he believes Biden should do, Schiff urged the President to consult with others and keep an open mind, expressing confidence that Biden will ultimately make the right decision.Finally, Schiff praised Vice President Kamala Harris, describing her as a potential phenomenal president with the experience, judgment, and leadership ability to win overwhelmingly.

He got the chance at a church service at Mount Airy Church of God in Christ in northwest Philadelphia, where Biden entered the gold-chandeliered sanctuary to applause.Early in the service, Pastor Louis Felton asked churchgoers to lock arms before declaring, ""There is no election we can not win.""""There is no enemy we can not defeat,"" Felton said. ""We are together because we love our president.""The president was later heading to Harrisburg to speak at an organizing event with union members and local Democrats. On Sunday evening, he returns to Washington, where leaders from NATO countries will gather for a three-day summit beginning Tuesday to mark the military alliance's 75th anniversary.The focus could shift more to Russia's war in Ukraine than questions about Biden's reelection campaign, but the 81-year-old Biden's political situation remains precarious. FiveDemocratic lawmakers have called on him to abandon his reelection bid ahead of November, and more could do so in coming days, as Congress reconvenes.Meeting in person will give congressional Democrats a chance to discuss concerns about Biden's ability to withstand the remaining four months of the campaign - not to mention four more years in the White House - and true prospects of beating former Republican former President Donald Trump.Biden's campaign team is quietly bracing for the chorus of those calling for him to leave the race to grow in coming days holding the call with surrogates and calling and texting lawmakers to try and head off more potential defections. The president also got a weekend boost from other key Democrats who had raised previous questions but now have moved to support him, led by speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi and representative James Clyburn of South Carolina.With the Democratic convention fast approaching, the short term is especially critical.Since his disastrous debate performance late last month donors, strategists, lawmakers and their constituents have urged Democrats to replace him at the top of the ticket before, they argue, it's too late. Biden's Friday interview with ABC has not convinced some who remain skeptical that he can resurrect his campaign.Biden has insisted he's not yielding to any other potential Democratic presidential candidate, arguing that he's still the party's best shot to beat Trump. His visiting a Black church, gives him a chance to energize African-American voters, who are Democrats' largest and most-loyal bloc of support. It could also send a message to members of the Congressional Black Caucus , whose endorsement the president will need as he works to quell potential rebellion on Capitol Hill.At the Essence Festival of Culture in New Orleans on Saturday, Biden got enthusiastic support from four of the caucus' members, including Rep. Joyce Beatty, D-Ohio, who told attendees ""don't get out there and turn your back on this president.""California Democratic representative Maxine Waters, who is 85, drew a standing ovation by declaring, ""People say Joe Biden's too old. Hell, I'm older than Biden!""""It ain't gonna be no other Democratic candidate,"" Waters said ""and we better know it.""Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut told CNN said that Biden ""needs to answer those questions that voters have"" but added, ""If he does that this week, I think he will be in a very good position and we can get back to what this campaign needs to be.""During his Friday interview, Biden rejected undergoing independent cognitive testing, arguing that the everyday rigors of the presidency were proof enough of his mental acuity. But California Democratic representative Adam Schiff told NBC on Sunday that he'd be ""happy if both the president and Donald Trump took a cognitive test.""Schiff added that the president opting to stay in the race ""is going to come down to what Joe Biden thinks is best"" and that he could ""run hard"" to beat Trump or ""if his decision is to pass the torch, then the president should do everything in his power to make that other candidate successful.""Schiff warned that Biden needs to consider how he risks dragging down Democrats down the ticket: ""Look, there are concerns with the impact on down ballot races if the president doesn't do well.""""You can only run so far ahead of the president,"" he said.As some Democrats have done, Schiff also seized on Biden suggesting during the ABC interview that losing to Trump would be acceptable ""as long as I give it my all.""""This is not just about whether he gave it the best college try,"" Schiff said ""but rather whether he made the right decision to run or to pass the torch.""","President Joe Biden attended a Black church and was rallying with union members on Sunday in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania.

The electoral watchdog has committed the greatest fraud in the country. We are seeking justice.
