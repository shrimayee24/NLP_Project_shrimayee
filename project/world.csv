India backs EU’s quest for just peace in Ukraine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-backs-eus-quest-for-just-peace-in-ukraine/articleshow/118637170.cms,"PM Narendra Modi with EU leader Ursula von der Leyen

PM Narendra Modi joined EU leader Ursula von der Leyen in expressing support – in a leaders’ statement after their meeting Friday – for a just and lasting peace in Ukraine that’s based on respect for international law, principles of the UN Charter and territorial integrity and sovereignty.The leaders also reiterated their commitment to the “vision of the two-State solution” with Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace and security within recognized borders, consistent with international law. This is the first time India has reiterated its support for the two-state solution at the highest level since President Donald Trump announced his plan to overtake Gaza.The solidarity with the EU on Ukraine is particularly significant in the context of what happened in the UN this week when EU States led by France managed to water down the US “forward looking resolution” on Ukraine in the General Assembly that called for lasting, but not just and comprehensive, peace and a swift end to the conflict. The language used in the India-EU leaders’ statement is similar to one of the 3 amendments that France introduced in that resolution - just, lasting and comprehensive peace in Ukraine that respects the United Nations Charter and the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity.The amendments meant that the US had to abstain from voting on its own resolution in the General Assembly, although it was later adopted in the Security Council in its original form, with 10 votes in favour. The UK, France and the remaining members – Greece, Slovenia and Denmark – abstained.Interestingly, neither leader explicitly mentioned the Ukraine issue in their media statements that followed their bilateral meeting. While describing India as a pillar of certainty in an increasingly uncertain world, von der Leyen only said that authoritarian states are getting bolder, ignoring borders and threatening peace at sea.However, at a public event earlier in the day, she lashed out at Russia for trying to tear Ukraine apart and said what the EU seeks is for any peace talk to lead to “just and lasting” peace. Playing on India’s concerns about China’s expansionism, the EU leader said a failed Ukraine would not just weaken Europe but also ""intensify"" challenges in other parts of the world. “Not least in this region. Other countries around the world are watching very closely whether there is any impunity if you invade a neighbour or violate international borders. Or whether there are real deterrents,’’ said von der Leyen, adding peace, security and prosperity are indivisible in this world.The landmark EU visit, which saw von der Leyen accompanied by the College of Commissioners for the first time, had been in the works for almost 6 months but happened finally at a time its transatlantic alliance is threatening to unravel because of Trump’s policies. The president said wars, conflicts and coups have erupted in Europe, the Middle East and Asia, in Africa and across different regions, adding what happens in one part of the world matters to both Europe and India.“With a free and prosperous Ukraine, that can join the European family. And Europe is ready to live up to its responsibility when it comes to security and defence. We will step up our defence spending to ensure that Member States have access to the full spectrum of capabilities that this new reality demands,’’ she added, talking about historic steps to protect Ukraine and its future.",PM Narendra Modi joined EU leader Ursula von der Leyen in expressing support for a just and lasting peace in Ukraine.

Uttarakhand avalanche: Mana villagers saved by ancient wisdom & annual migration,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/uttarakhand-avalanche-mana-villagers-saved-by-ancient-wisdom-annual-migration/articleshow/118637614.cms,"Each Nov, as doors of Badrinath temple close, residents of Mana move to Gopeshwar, Jyotirmath, and Jhinkwan in Chamoli district, leaving behind their homes and livelihoods to escape harsh winter

DEHRADUN: Mana, a 2,000-strong village in the upper reaches of Garhwal Himalayas , had already emptied out when disaster struck. By the time an avalanche crashed down the Mana-Ghastoli route on Friday morning, smothering everything in its path, the roads were deserted, the homes abandoned. As a result, not many heard the sound of ice fracturing, snow cascading, and the earth shuddering under its weight. They are now counting their blessings.The villagers' migration, a ritual dictated by centuries of wisdom, is more than tradition - it is survival. The Himalayas demand deference, and the people of Mana have long known when to step aside. ""We are fortunate we had shifted to lower locations; otherwise, many people could have been trapped,"" said Pitambhar Molpha , the village headman.Each Nov, as the doors of the Badrinath temple close, the residents of Mana undertake their annual migration, leaving behind their homes and livelihoods to escape the harsh winter. They move to Gopeshwar, Jyotirmath, and Jhinkwan in Chamoli district. They return only when the Badrinath yatra is about to begin.The avalanche - just 500 metres from the village - was neither the first nor the last. ""Avalanches have been reported here in Feb and March before,"" Molpha said. ""At this time of year, workers are engaged in removing snow from the main routes. There is also an army camp near our village.""For those who leave, there is always the lingering question of what remains. Sandeep Aswal, who runs a tea stall - once known as the 'last tea stall of the country' and now rebranded as the 'first tea stall' - has watched tourists come and go, drawn by Mana's mystique. ""It is an unfortunate incident. Since the village is empty, we don't have any updates on whether the avalanche impacted the area. But we feel blessed that all 400 families had already moved,"" he said.","Mana, a 2,000-strong village in the upper reaches of Garhwal Himalayas, had already emptied out when disaster struck.

AJMER/BHILWARA/JAIPUR: Protests over alleged sexual exploitation of at least six minor girls in Rajasthan's Bijayanagar and Tonk have snowballed to other areas. Kishangarh witnessed a complete shutdown Friday, while Ajmer is set to follow suit Saturday.It is alleged that five Class X girls were filmed in compromising situations, blackmailed and sexually exploited in Beawar's Bijaynagar town over a period of time. Allegations of forced religious conversion and coercion into reciting the Kalma and observing fasts were also made by the girls. Three FIRs were filed over this on Feb 15 and 16. In Tonk, a 14-year-old girl was blackmailed and exploited by six individuals, including five minors, over a period of one and a half years before her father filed an FIR on Feb 15.The investigation in these FIRs has led to the arrests of 10 adults and three minors so far.The latest arrest in the Bijaynagar case was reported late Thursday. Sanwarmal Jat, a restaurant owner accused of providing his cafe for alleged abuse of schoolgirls, was held in Bengaluru. Deputy SP Masuda Sajjan Singh said Jat's restaurant was used as a meeting point for the accused, where the victims were abused and filmed.In the Tonk case, one of the accused, identified as Nihal Akram, befriended the girl on Instagram and then filmed her in compromising positions. This triggered a chain of sexual exploitation, with six more boys, mostly teenagers, exploiting her in cafes, cars, and buildings.Kishangarh, known for its marble industry, came to a standstill during the bandh Friday over the abuse cases in Bijaynagar. In Ajmer, businesses, transport and markets are expected to remain closed Saturday after over 100 trade associations extended support for the bandh.","Protests over alleged sexual exploitation of at least six minor girls in Rajasthan's Bijayanagar and Tonk have snowballed to other areas.

JAMMU: Incessant rains continued to lash Jammu for the third straight day on Friday, leading to the deaths of a mother-son duo and halting traffic on the strategic Jammu-Srinagar National highway due to piles of snow, landslides, slush and boulders. The rains had caused three deaths on Thursday, taking the total to five in the past 24 hours.Early Friday, Shano Devi (50) and her son Raghu (25) died when a boulder rolled down and hit their two-wheeler in Moungari area of Udhampur district, officials said.Elsewhere, 12 workers were rescued from the flood fury. “Around 11 labourers were rescued from Ujh river in Rajbagh area of Kathua,” an official said, adding they were putting up a shed near a construction site when they were suddenly marooned in the flash floods. Police and SDRF teams rescued a truck driver trapped in floods in Niki Tawi area of Jammu.The situation on the Srinagar highway remained grim. “No fresh traffic was allowed owing to accumulation of snow between Ramsoo and Qazigund, shooting of stones, landslides and mudslides at various places between Nashri and Banihal. Traffic was suspended around 7pm Thursday, leaving hundreds of vehicles stranded,” an official said.Batote-Doda road was also closed due to landslides, while Bhaderwah-Chamba road, Mughal road and Sinthan road were shut due to snow, traffic police posted on X. “Inclement weather affected helicopter services to Sanjichhat ( Vaishno Devi shrine) from Katra on Friday.

NEW DELHI/THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Congress warned party functionaries from Kerala against speaking out of turn or breaching the discipline, warning that action will be taken if any neta ""crossed the party line"". The message came as the party brass brainstormed with the state unit to prepare for assembly polls scheduled next year. The party specifically told state members that unnecessary media controversies should be avoided.As the meeting came in the backdrop of a spate of controversies and speculations about the steering of the state unit, sources said there was unanimity among Kerala functionaries that concerns about the lack of leadership pertained to the top of the hierarchy, and not the lower levels. The view from a cross section of leaders has political significance in view of speculations that the state president K Sudhakaran can be replaced.However, AICC state in-charge Deepa Dasmunshi said the leadership issue was not on the meeting's agenda. She also stressed on "" collective leadership "" as the Congress brass' message. Meanwhile, it was learned that there would be no change in KPCC leadership and Sudhakaran would continue.The meeting chaired by party chief Mallikarjun Kharge and attended by Rahul Gandhi, PCC chief Sudhakaran, LoP V Satheesan, K C Venugopal, and senior netas and MPs including Ramesh Chennithala, K Suresh, P J Kurien, Priyanka Gandhi, Shashi Tharoor, Hibi Eden, Jebi Mather, Dean Kuriakose, among others.Dasmunshi, quoting Rahul Gandhi, said he spoke about the connect between Keralites and Congress, and warned party biggies not to do anything that ""disrespects"" people. She clarified that no party neta is pro-LDF, in what appeared a bid to clear the air over Tharoor's praise of investment under the LDF govt.

He recalled that Kumar broke ties with the BJP in 2013, later joined the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan in 2015, returned to the BJP in 2017, moved back to the RJD camp in 2022, and then rejoined the NDA last year.""To break this cycle, and to ensure that the arrow (JD(U)'s poll symbol) does not float with the lotus (BJP) nor burn bright with the lantern (RJD), I appeal to the people that they vote in a manner that the JD(U) does not win even one seat. Only then would we be rid of the chief minister who is physically tired and mentally retired,"" Kishor said.Moreover, Prashant Kishor, a former JD(U) national vice president, also criticized the BJP, saying it was using Nitish Kumar as a ""mask"" while holding power. He alleged that the recent cabinet expansion, just months before the elections, was aimed at misusing public money and appeasing certain castes.""Swearing in 7 new ministers 6 months before the term of this government ends simply means that they want to loot the people before tenure of the government ends,"" Prashant Kishor said.Also read: Bihar Cabinet expansion: CM Nitish Kumar allocates portfolios to 7 newly-inducted BJP MLAs Claiming that the people were dissatisfied with both the ruling NDA and the RJD-led opposition, Kishor announced plans for a ""Badlo Bihar Rally"" on April 11. ""We have written to the district administration in Patna, asking for permission to hold the rally on April 11. I wager that the turnout will break all records. Though we also foresee the possibility of the jittery in the ruling dispensation trying to pave hurdles by denying permission,"" he said.Kishor was also asked about recent statements by the chief minister’s son, Nishant Kumar, who has insisted that his father is ""100 per cent"" fit and capable of serving another term. This has led to speculation about Nishant’s possible entry into politics.Responding to this, Kishor said, ""I do not want to say much about Nishant since he is not in public life. But I challenge his father to spell out the names of ministers in the state cabinet without looking at a piece of paper. If Nitish Kumar thus demonstrates his mental soundness, I would give up politics and start working for him.""Recently, Kishor was arrested while on a fast demanding the cancellation of the BPSC exams.","Political strategist-turned-activist Prashant Kishor urged voters to ensure that Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar ’s party, the JD(U), does not win any seats in the upcoming assembly elections.

Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump openly clashed in the White House on Friday at a meeting where they were due to sign a deal on sharing Ukraine's mineral riches and discuss a peace deal with Russia . US President gave an ultimatum saying, ""make a deal or we are out.""""Your people are very brave, but you're either going to make a deal or we're out, and if we're out, you'll fight it out,"" Trump said in the White House in a dramatic verbal clash.""I don't think it's going to be pretty, but you'll fight it out, but you don't have the cards.""""You're not acting at all thankful. It's not a nice thing,"" the US president said. ""It's going to be very hard to do business like this,"" he added.The encounter began when Vice President JD Vance addressed Zelenskyy, stating ""Mr. President, with respect.

Trump openly revealed his intentions to secure American interests in Ukraine's mineral resources and influence the war's resolution according to his preferences.During the earlier portion of the meeting, Trump indicated continued military support for Ukraine whilst expressing a preference for limited arms provision. ""We're not looking forward to sending a lot of arms,"" he stated.

'American dream': Donald Trump’s executive order set to make English the official US language,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/american-dream-donald-trumps-executive-order-set-to-make-english-the-official-us-language/articleshow/118640325.cms,"Donald Trump

US President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order officially designating English as the national language of the United States, a move that has sparked both support and criticism.The order is expected to be signed on Friday, reverses a mandate introduced by former US President Bill Clinton in 2000 that required federal agencies and organisations receiving government funding to provide language assistance to non-English speakers.For nearly 250 years, the United States has never had an official language, despite English being the primary language used in major documents like the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. Now, Trump’s order will change that, aligning the US with the 180-plus countries worldwide that have designated official languages.Under the new policy, federal agencies will have the discretion to decide whether to continue offering multilingual services . Critics fear this could create barriers for non-English speakers when it comes to immigration, voter participation, and access to government resources.The White House has framed the decision as a step towards ""unity, efficiency in government operations, and a pathway for civic engagement."" It also argues that the order will celebrate multilingual Americans who have learned English while encouraging immigrants to adopt the language to achieve the ""American dream.""However, advocacy groups have strongly opposed the move. Vanessa Cárdenas, executive director of America’s Voice, an immigration reform organisation, said:""This isn’t just an offensive gesture that sticks a thumb in the eye of millions of US citizens who speak other languages, but also will directly harm those who have previously relied on language assistance for vital information.""The change could also affect citizenship applications and voting access. Currently, some applicants can take the naturalisation test in their native language if they meet certain residency and age requirements. Activists warn that removing multilingual resources could make it harder for people to become citizens.Anabel Mendoza of United We Dream, an immigrant advocacy group, said the order sends a clear message: ""Trump is trying to send the message that if you’re not white, rich, and speak English, you don’t belong here.""Groups like APIAVote also argue that the policy will create barriers for elderly naturalised citizens and minority communities who may struggle to access vital services, from healthcare to economic aid.Some critics have also raised concerns about how the executive order might affect US territories such as Puerto Rico, where Spanish is the dominant language.More than 30 US states have already designated English as their official language. Hawaii is the only state with two official languages—English and Hawaiian.Efforts to make English the national language at a federal level have been introduced in Congress multiple times over the years, but none have passed. The most recent attempt came in 2023 when Senators Kevin Cramer and JD Vance introduced the English Language Unity Act.Trump has previously signalled his support for such a policy. At the 2024 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), he said: ""We have languages coming into our country. We don’t have one instructor in our entire nation that can speak that language. It’s the craziest thing... It’s a very horrible thing.""Since returning to office in January, Trump has signed at least 76 executive orders. Among them, he has renamed the Gulf of Mexico to the ""Gulf of America"" and restored Mount McKinley’s name after it was changed to Denali under President Barack Obama.The move to make English the official language is expected to face legal and political challenges.","US President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order officially designating English as the national language of the United States.

Zelenskyy asked whether he owes Trump an apology

Heated Exchange between President Trump, Vice President Vance and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday reacted to the heated exchange with US President Donald Trump during Ukraine-US talks at the Oval Office, calling the incident 'not good for both sides.'In an interview with Fox News, Zelenskyy was asked if he thought he owed the US President an apology. The Ukrainian President said, ""I’m not sure we did something bad,"" but maintained his respect for Trump and the American people.Zelenskyy also added: ""I think this kind of spat is not good for both sides. I am very open but I can't change our Ukrainian attitude to Russia. They are killers to us. It is very clear that Americans are the best of our friends. Europeans are the best of our friends. Putin with Russia are our enemies. And it doesn't mean that we don't want peace. We just want to recognise the reality.""Despite the tense encounter, Zelenskyy maintained his respect for Trump and the American people, insisting, ""I’m not sure we did something bad.""Zelenskyy acknowledged the impact of the clash on diplomatic relations but stressed the importance of continued US support for Ukraine ’s defence against Russia. ""It would be difficult for us if the US withdrew its support,” he said, adding that the televised confrontation was regrettable, but he urged, ""Please be correct. I want to be polite.""When asked whether the confrontation was pre-planned, Zelenskyy called it ""a really tough situation"" and questioned the current state of US-Ukraine relations, asking, ""Where is our friendship?"" He remained firm on Ukraine’s pursuit of ""justice and lasting peace,"" pointing out that the ""mineral deal is part of the structure of the security guarantee.""However, secretary of state Rubio demanded an apology from the Ukrainian President for the meeting which took an ugly turn in the Oval Office. Rubio described the meeting as ""fiasco.""Amid growing speculation about Trump’s close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin , Zelenskyy commented, ""I want him to be in the middle. I want him to be on our side."" He expressed optimism about repairing relations with Trump despite the recent spat, saying, ""Yes, of course.""Zelenskyy in the interview also expressed regret for the public fallout. ""We are thankful and sorry for this.

WATCH: Trump argues with Zelenskyy in Oval Office

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was put on the spot during a press conference on Friday when a reporter asked why he never wears a suit. The reporter asked, ""You're the highest level in this country's office and you refuse to wear a suit. Just want to see if you do own a suit.""Zelenskyy, known for his signature military-style clothing, responded by asking the reporter if he had an issue with his outfit.

Maybe something better. I don't know. We will see. Maybe something cheaper than this,"" the Ukranian President said.Following the question, Brian Glenn, who asked Zelenskyy the question, took to X to double down on his comment. He reiterated that the Ukrainian president's ""wardrobe is a reflection of his lack of respect for the US.""His comments came amid a tense visit to Washington, where he met with US President Donald Trump in the Oval Office. Trump appeared to make a pointed remark about Zelenskyy’s attire, greeting him with, ""Oh look, he’s all dressed up today!"" as the Ukrainian leader, dressed in his usual black sweater, entered the room.The meeting quickly took a dramatic turn, with Trump berating Zelenskyy for being ""disrespectful"" and abruptly cancelling a minerals deal that had been expected to bring Ukraine closer to securing vital support from the US. The tense exchange reportedly led to Zelenskyy being escorted from the White House by top Trump advisers.During the heated discussion, Trump accused Zelenskyy of ""gambling with World War III"" and suggested that Ukraine had not shown enough gratitude for American assistance. Vice President JD Vance also criticised the Ukrainian leader, stating, ""I think it’s disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media.""Zelenskyy, in response, defended his position and warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin could not be trusted.

For days, attorney general Pam Bondi had talked about releasing the “Epstein files”, supposedly secret documents the federal govt has on some of the powerful men who were in the orbit of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein But the roughly 200 pages of documents that Bondi released Thursday contained little new information pointing to wrongdoing by anyone other than Epstein, a registered sex offender who died in jail. The document dump largely consisted of flight logs for Epstein’s planes — long ago made public — and contact information for hundreds of associates, along with brief descriptions of items found at his residences.The release was billed as a gesture ushering in a new era of transparency at the justice department . But the hyped first release of documents, which Bondi teased as “breaking news” in a Fox News appearance Wednesday night, appeared to be mostly political theatre. On Thursday afternoon, Bondi and Kash Patel, director of the FBI , offered a sneak preview of the documents to several conservative influencers, some of whom emerged from West Wing waving chunky white binders with the label “Epstein Files: Phase I.” One of them later cal led it an “interesting souvenir.”But by midafternoon, the justice department had not posted the contents. And Bondi was drawing criticism on social media from those who had taken her at her word the night before. Bondi responded by promising more documents to come. Later, she said a “source” in the FBI field office in New York City had told her the bureau withheld “thousands” of previously unknown pages of Epstein-related documents and that she was determined to get them. The documents were released late Thursday, along with a statement from Patel that said: “If there are gaps, we will find them. If records have been hidden, we will uncover them.” Still, some Republicans in Congress took to X to voice displeasure. “Get us the information we asked for!” wrote RepresentativeAnna Paulina Luna.Much of the material, including transcripts of victim interviews and old police reports, had already been publicly known. They included mentions of Trump, ex-president Bill Clinton, UK’s Prince Andrew and magician David Copperfield, as well as testimony from one victim who said she met Michael Jackson at Epstein’s Florida home but nothing untoward happened with him.","Attorney general Pam Bondi had talked about releasing the “Epstein files’ The supposedly secret documents the federal govt has on some of the powerful men who were in the orbit of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.

US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he trusted Russian President Putin not to violate the terms of a potential peace deal with Ukraine, even as he refused to pledge US military support for a peacekeeping force. “I think he’ll keep his word,” Trump said of Putin as he hosted Britain’s PM, Keir Starmer, at the White House. Of Putin, the president said, “I’ve known him for a long time now.”Trump’s comments underscored his embrace of Putin ahead of meeting with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.In the opening weeks of his presidency, Trump has ended the diplomatic isolation of Russia, falsely accused Ukraine of starting the war with Russia and repeatedly disparaged Zelensky, including by calling him a “dictator.” He appeared to change his tune Thursday. “I have a lot of respect for him,” Trump said. Earlier in the news conference, when asked if he still thought Zelensky was a dictator, Trump deadpanned: “Uh, did I say that? I can’t believe I said that.”Starmer was the latest in a series of European leaders to come to Washington hoping to reason with Trump.“History must be on the side of the peacemaker, not the invader,” Starmer said as he stood next to Trump. “The UK is ready to put boots on the ground and planes in the air to support a deal, working closely with our allies. Because that is the only way peace will last,” the PM said. But his efforts to nudge Trump in Ukraine’s direction appeared not to have not worked. Trump made no mention of US forces supporting a peacekeeping mission that included UK troops.In the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump was asked what would happen if Britain sent peacekeeping troops to Ukraine, only for Russia to renege on a peace deal. Would the Americans come to the aid of the British in Ukraine? In the span of a minute, Trump seemed to say no (“They can take care of themselves very well”), and then yes (“If they need help, I’ll always be with the British”), before landing back on no (“They don’t need help”). “Could you take on Russia by yourselves?” Trump asked Starmer. Uneasy laughter broke out in the room.","“I think he’ll keep his word,” Trump said of Putin as he hosted Britain’s PM, Keir Starmer, at the White House. “History must be on the side of the peacemaker, not the invader,’ Starmer said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118640289,imgsize-578555,width-400,resizemode-4/118640289.jpg"

Who is Rafael Caro Quintero?



Who were the other extradited cartel figures?



Mexico has extradited 29 drug cartel figures to the United States, including infamous kingpin Rafael Caro Quintero , the architect of the 1985 murder of a US DEA agent, on Thursday.The large-scale transfer, seen as an extraordinary act of security cooperation, comes as Mexican officials engage in high-stakes negotiations in Washington to avert the Trump administration’s threat of sweeping 25% tariffs on Mexican imports.Prosecutors from both nations confirmed that the inmates transferred to the US were charged with various offences, including drug trafficking and, in certain instances, murder alongside other criminal activities.""We will prosecute these criminals to the fullest extent of the law in honor of the brave law enforcement agents who have dedicated their careers - and in some cases, given their lives - to protect innocent people from the scourge of violent cartels,"" US Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement.Rafael Caro Quintero is one of Mexico’s most infamous drug lords and a founding member of the Guadalajara Cartel , a key player in the rise of modern Mexican drug trafficking.He is best known for orchestrating the 1985 kidnapping, torture, and murder of US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent Enrique ""Kiki"" Camarena, a crime that severely strained US-Mexico relations.Caro Quintero was arrested and sentenced to 40 years in prison for his role in the murder, but in 2013, after serving 28 years, a Mexican court controversially overturned his sentence, allowing him to walk free—much to the outrage of US authorities.Following his release, he resumed drug trafficking and was linked to violent turf wars in northern Mexico, particularly in Sonora.The US renewed efforts to capture him, and in 2022, after years on the run, he was recaptured by Mexican forces. His arrest came during a high-risk operation that resulted in the deaths of 14 Mexican Marines in a helicopter crash. A navy dog ultimately found him hiding in the bushes.Pressure from the US, including the Trump administration’s threats of trade tariffs and the designation of Mexican cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, intensified calls for his extradition.According to BBC, the other extradited figures were Miguel Ángel Treviño (Z-40) and Omar Treviño (Z-42), the former leaders of the brutal Zetas Cartel, known for their extreme violence.Miguel Treviño, arrested in 2013, was wanted in both the US and Mexico for orchestrating massacres and running a global drug empire. His brother, Omar, was captured in 2015 and faced multiple charges, including drug trafficking, kidnapping, and murder.Other cartel operatives included Vicente Carrillo Fuentes, the former leader of the Juarez Cartel and brother of Amado Carrillo Fuentes, known as ""The Lord of the Skies,"" who died during a botched plastic surgery in 1997.Additionally, the extradition list featured high-ranking security chiefs from different factions of the Sinaloa Cartel, cartel financial operators, and a suspect linked to the 2022 killing of a North Carolina sheriff’s deputy.The justice department indicated that amongst the 29 detainees, six individuals could potentially face the federal death penalty, which was reinstated by the Trump administration at the beginning of his term.","Rafael Caro Quintero is one of Mexico’s most infamous drug lords and a founding member of the Guadalajara Cartel.

His credentials include being a political figure and Islamic academic, with a tenure in the National Assembly spanning from November 2002 to 2007. Following his father's tragic death, he assumed the roles of vice chancellor at Jamia Darul Uloon Haqqania and chairman of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (Sami).The madressah was established by Islamic scholar Maulana Abdul Haq Haqqani in September 1947, according to the institution's website.Previously, the Madrassa faced scrutiny when its students were alleged to be involved in former prime minister Benazir Bhutto's assassination. However, the madrassa has consistently denied any links to the suspects.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif issued a firm condemnation of the incident and offered prayers for Maulana Haq and other casualties' recovery, as stated by the Prime Minister's Office.He instructed authorities to provide excellent medical care to the wounded individuals and requested a detailed incident report.""Such cowardly and heinous acts of terrorism cannot dampen our resolve against terrorism,"" the PM said.

United States President Donald Trump told Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday that Kyiv must accept ""compromises"" for a peace agreement with Moscow.""You can't do any deals without compromises.

Driving the news

His past statements provide a window into this philosophy:

Take Palestinians out of Gaza—problem solved.

Let Putin keep Ukrainian land—war over.

Buy Greenland, Canada, or Panama—because why not?

Slash the defense budget—America should profit, not protect.

The mafia-like presidency

It was a scene right out of “The Godfather”: “Bessent pushed the paper across the table, demanding that Zelensky sign it …. Zelensky took a quick look and said he would discuss it with his team. Bessent then pushed the paper closer to Zelensky. ‘You really need to sign this,’ the Treasury secretary said. Zelensky said he was told ‘people back in Washington’ would be very upset if he didn’t. The Ukrainian leader said he took the document but didn’t commit to signing.” Thomas L Friedman in an NYT opinion piece 'The Disturbing Question at the Heart of the Trump-Zelensky Drama'

Or are we being led by a Mafia godfather, looking to carve up territory with Russia the way the heads of crime families operate? “I’ll take Greenland, and you can take Crimea. I’ll take Panama, and you can have the oil in the Arctic. And we’ll split the rare earths of Ukraine. It’s only fair.” Thomas L Friedman in the NYT opinion piece 'The Disturbing Question at the Heart of the Trump-Zelensky Drama'

Deals vs dictatorship: Trump and Putin

The mafia overtones in these expressions of raw power are no accident. Their purpose is to intimidate, showing that the Russian state will stop at nothing to secure itself. They are central to the regime. Putin’s Russia does not have the European élan and diplomatic acumen of the Russian Empire. It does not have the revolutionary appeal of the Soviet Union. Its economy is top-heavy with state-owned enterprises and resists innovation, and its foreign policy has needlessly isolated Russia from the West. What Putin excels at is generating wealth for the state and converting this wealth into coercive force. An article in the WSJ titled 'The Godfather in the Kremlin'

Why it matters

The big picture

Ukraine: Pay up or get out: Trump has repeatedly suggested Ukraine should pay for US support. Initially, he demanded $500 billion in return for military aid but settled for a vague deal giving the US access to Ukraine’s mineral wealth. When Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hesitated, Trump’s team gave him an ultimatum—sign the agreement within an hour or risk losing US backing. Trump’s approach prioritizes short-term gains over long-term stability. While he’s willing to pressure Ukraine into economic concessions, he has made major concessions to Putin without receiving anything in return.

At a rally in South Carolina, Trump claimed he told the leader of an unnamed Nato country that if they didn’t meet their defense spending obligations, he would “encourage” Russia to do “whatever the hell they want”. The remarks sent shockwaves through Europe, with Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warning that Trump’s threats put “US and European soldiers at increased risk”. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called Trump’s comments “appalling”.

The irony? Trump portrays himself as a master negotiator, but his rhetoric weakens America’s bargaining position. By threatening Nato, he signals to Russia that the US is no longer committed to defending Europe, making future conflicts more likely, not less.

Trump’s view of China mirrors his approach to Nato—he sees relationships as purely transactional. If China limits exports or helps curb North Korea’s nuclear ambitions, Trump may be willing to grant concessions on Taiwan, the South China Sea, or other strategic areas. His philosophy ignores a fundamental reality: America’s influence comes from its ability to uphold global norms, not just from economic muscle. If Trump undermines Taiwan’s security, for example, China could take that as a green light for aggression, with long-term consequences for US leadership in Asia.

The end of the rules-based order

This new system has a new hierarchy. America is number one. Next are countries with resources to sell, threats to make and leaders unconstrained by democracy. Vladimir Putin wants to restore Russia as a great imperial power. Muhammad bin Salman wants to modernise the Middle East and fend off Iran. Xi Jinping is both a committed communist and a nationalist who wants a world fit for a strong China. In the third rank are America’s allies, their dependence and loyalty seen as weaknesses to exploit. An article in the Economist titled 'Donald Trump has begun a mafia-like struggle for global power'

The house always wins?

What’s next

Nato could collapse: If Trump continues undermining the alliance, European nations may seek security agreements elsewhere, reducing US influence.

A transactional approach to Taiwan could embolden Beijing, increasing the risk of conflict. Middle East instability may deepen. Trump’s disregard for Palestinian rights could fuel further unrest, making long-term peace harder to achieve.

On February 24, US President Donald Trump met with French President Emmanuel Macron at the White House. Smiling confidently, he said: ""My whole life is deals."" His approach to America’s role in the world is shifting away from alliances, treaties, and ideology. Instead, it now focuses more on transactions, power, and control.Trump is redefining US foreign policy with a ruthless, deal-making approach reminiscent of a ""mafia don"". His strategy is simple: every problem has a transactional solution.This shift away from the post-1945 order was on full display this week at the United Nations, where America broke ranks with its traditional European allies and voted alongside Russia and North Korea. Meanwhile, Trump’s emissaries are flying between capitals, peddling what can only be described as protection-racket diplomacy: security and favors in exchange for lucrative deals.Nato leaders, already anxious about Trump’s potential return, fear the collapse of the alliance. As per a report in the Economist, Germany’s likely new chancellor, Friedrich Merz, warns Nato could be dead by June.The comparison between Trump and a mafia don is more than rhetorical flourish. The administration operates under a strict hierarchy where loyalty is rewarded, dissent is punished, and personal allegiance to the boss outweighs institutional loyalty. His inner circle, including figures like Scott Bessent, serve not just as advisers but as enforcers of his world order—a world where the only rule is that America must come out on top.The Don Corleone approach to governance extends to foreign relations, where international allies are now viewed as vassal states. ""America First"" has become less about national interest and more about tribute—forcing allies to pay up or be abandoned. Nato allies, for instance, are given ultimatums: meet Trump’s financial demands or find yourself at the mercy of adversaries. ""Why should we defend them for free?"" the president has repeatedly asked. The logic is simple: if America is the global mafia boss, then protection is a service, not an obligation.Trump’s transactional style stands in sharp relief against Putin’s more traditional strongman tactics. Putin rules by force and fear – invading neighbors, assassinating opponents, propping up despots by brute force. His contempt for the post-1945 order is expressed in tanks and poisonings.In Moscow, power operates differently. The death of Yevgeny Prigozhin in a plane crash last year—widely seen as a Kremlin-orchestrated hit, with US intelligence agencies dismissing coincidence underscored Russia’s evolution into a mafia state. Putin’s regime thrives on violence: opposition leaders like Alexei Navalny die in prison, while ""traitors"" like Prigozhin meet spectacular ends.Trump, by contrast, eschewed starting new wars or outright annexations; his tools are tariffs, threats to walk away, and personal deal-making. In essence, Putin is willing to break legs, while Trump prefers to bend arms.Trump’s strategy is not to eliminate enemies, but to delegitimize them, ensuring that any opposition—whether from the press, political opponents, or even former allies—is dismissed as weak, corrupt, or, in his preferred term, ""losers.""Trump’s Godfather-style diplomacy threatens to dismantle the global order the US has led since World War II. He believes international alliances and rules have weakened America, favoring raw economic and military power instead.Unlike Vladimir Putin , who uses assassinations and poisonings to eliminate opponents, Trump wields threats and financial leverage to assert dominance. His foreign policy is guided by a belief that everything is negotiable—territory, alliances, military support, even the fundamental principles of democracy.But this approach carries risks. It destabilizes US alliances, reduces American influence, and emboldens autocratic leaders like Putin and China’s Xi Jinping , who view Trump’s unpredictable nature as an opportunity rather than a deterrent.Trump sees foreign policy as a series of deals, where loyalty is bought and sold. His worldview disrupts decades of strategic alliances, replacing them with power plays where only the strongest survive. Some key examples:The implications of this transactional approach are profound. The post-1945 order, built on rules and alliances, is unraveling. Trump views global institutions like Nato and the UN as scams designed to swindle America out of its wealth and power. His disdain for long-term strategy and preference for immediate gains means that the world is fast becoming a place where the biggest players dictate terms to the weak, the Economist report said.Territory is once again up for grabs. Trump’s interest in buying Greenland may have sounded like a joke, but it was emblematic of his belief that the map can still be redrawn through sheer willpower and financial muscle. In Trump’s world, sovereignty, security, and stability are commodities, to be negotiated and traded like real estate.Yet, as much as Trump portrays himself as the ultimate dealmaker, his approach contains an inherent contradiction: by dismantling alliances and traditional partnerships, he is diminishing America’s leverage rather than increasing it.The fundamental flaw in Trump’s thinking is that he assumes America will always hold the best hand. But in a world where diplomacy is reduced to a high-stakes poker game, there will come a moment when another player—be it China, Russia, or even a resurgent European bloc—calls his bluff.For now, Trump is relishing his role as the godfather of the international order, making offers and thinking that countries cannot refuse. But, as history has shown, even the most powerful dons eventually face their reckoning. The question is not whether Trump’s America can continue playing the game, but whether the house rules he is rewriting will one day turn against him.(With inputs from agencies)","Trump has repeatedly suggested Ukraine should pay for US support.

President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order designating English as the official language of the United States, according to the White House.The order will allow government agencies and organizations that receive federal funding to choose whether to continue to offer documents and services in language other than English, according to a fact sheet about the impending order.Trump had been expected to sign the order Friday. But by Friday night, the White House had not announced the order had been signed and did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.The executive order will rescind a mandate from former President Bill Clinton that required the government and organizations that received federal funding to provide language assistance to non-English speakers.Designating English as the national language ""promotes unity, establishes efficiency in government operations, and creates a pathway for civic engagement,"" according to the White House.More than 30 states have already passed laws designating English as their official language, according to U.S. English, a group that advocates for making English the official language in the United States.For decades, lawmakers in Congress have introduced legislation to designate English as the official language of the U.S., but those efforts have not succeeded.Within hours of Trump's inauguration last month, the new administration took down the Spanish language version of the official White House website.Hispanic advocacy groups and others expressed confusion and frustration at the change. The White House said at the time it was committed to bringing the Spanish language version of the website back online. As of Friday, it was still not restored.The White House did not immediately respond to a message about whether that would happen.Trump shut down the Spanish version of the website during his first term. It was restored when President Joe Biden was inaugurated.The Wall Street Journal first reported on the order Friday.","The order will allow government agencies and organizations that receive federal funding to choose whether to continue to offer documents and services in language other than English.

'Gambling With World War 3': Trump Shouts At Zelensky After Ukraine President Said This

Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova on Friday claimed that US President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance displayed ""a miracle of restraint"" by refraining from striking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during their heated confrontation at the White House.""I think Zelenskyy's biggest lie of all his lies was his assertion in the White House that the Kyiv regime in 2022 was alone, without support,"" she wrote on Telegram.""How Trump and Vance held back from hitting that scumbag is a miracle of restraint,"" she added.These remarks followed a heated clash in the Oval Office, where Trump and Vice President JD Vance shouted at Zelenskyy, accusing him of not being “thankful” for the US support in Ukraine’s three-year war against the Russian invasion.Kirill Dmitriev, who leads the Russian Direct Investment Fund, described the intense discussion between Trump and Zelensky as a significant moment.Dmitriev participated as one of Moscow's representatives in the Russian-American discussions that took place on February 18 in Saudi Arabia, marking the first such meeting since Russia's military actions in Ukraine commenced in 2022.The deputy head of Russia's Security Council and former Russian President, Dmitry Medvedev, described Zelensky in derogatory terms, noting his unfavourable reception in the Oval Office.Zelenskyy left the West Wing after spending two hours and 20 minutes inside. What started as a cordial Oval Office meeting quickly unraveled when he attempted to discuss Russian President Vladimir Putin's diplomatic stance with Vice President JD Vance in front of journalists and cameras.Vance initiated the tension by stating, ""Mr. President, with respect. I think it's disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media.""Vance continued with increased volume: ""Do you think it's respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?""In response, Zelensky cautioned the American leaders about potential consequences reaching US territory due to Russia's war in Ukraine.Following this, Trump joined the criticism. Vance additionally scolded Zelensky, stating: ""Have you said 'thank you' once in the entire meeting? In the entire meeting, have you said 'thank you?' … Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America — and the president who's trying to save your country.""When Zelenskyy attempted to respond, Trump raised his voice saying, ""You're gambling with the lives of millions of people.""""You're gambling with World War III, and what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country that's backed you far more than a lot of people say they should have,"" Trump continued.Trump indicated Zelenskyy's limited negotiating position.""You're not in a good position. You don't have the cards right now,"" Trump said pointing his finger towards Zelenskyy. ""With us you start having cards.""“I’m not playing cards,” said Zelenskyy in response.Trump further criticised Zelenskyy's attitude towards the US. ""It's going to be a very hard thing to do business like this,"" he remarked during their overlapping discussion about Ukraine's international support.""Again, just say thank you,"" Vance told Zelenskyy, criticising his public airing of disagreements. Trump, however, welcomed the exchange, stating, ""I think it's good for the American people to see what's going on.""""You're not acting at all thankful,"" Trump said.""This is going to be great television,” he added. The contentious exchange occurred at a crucial time for Ukraine, when Zelenskyy's agenda included seeking US support against potential future Russian military actions.Zelenskyy pushed back against Vance, emphasizing that he has expressed his appreciation to the American people and the president ""“a lot of times.""Zelenskyy left soon after, with Trump later posting on social media, “He can come back when he is ready for peace.”After departing the White House, the Ukrainian leader took to X stating: ""Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit,” Zelenskyy wrote. “Thank you @POTUS, Congress, and the American people.

He further admitted that aides were “scared to death” of allowing the 81-year-old president to engage in unscripted interviews ahead of the election.Speaking at an American University Science Institute seminar on Wednesday, LaRosa stated, ""Cover-up to me is a little hard, a little harsh. Every politician, everybody, every human being tries to cover up age. We were always, from day one, cognizant that age was an issue.""He continued, ""There are some things that are true, I mean, like the gaslighting. There was a lot of denial of the polling.

Zelensky's 'Thank You' Taunt After Trump, Vance Call Ukraine President 'Ungrateful' | Watch

WATCH: Trump argues with Zelenskyy in Oval Office

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday took a swipe at President Donald Trump after their heated Oval Office exchange and the collapse of a critical minerals deal.“Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit. Thank you @POTUS, Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that,” Zelenskyy wrote in a post on X.Zelenskyy's tweet follows a bust-up in the Oval Office, where Vance turned to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and asked, ""Have you said thank you once?"" The question came amid a heated discussion about the ongoing war in Ukraine and the support provided by the United States.Vance argued, ""I think it's disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media."" He added that Zelenskyy should be thanking President Biden for his efforts to bring an end to the conflict and for the military support the US had provided. ""You should be thanking the president for trying to bring an end to this conflict,"" Vance said.Zelenskyy, responding to Vance, defended Ukraine’s position, saying, ""Have you ever been to Ukraine? You say what problems we have."" He acknowledged that Ukraine has problems but maintained that the country has been alone in its fight. ""We are staying in our country, staying strong, from the very beginning of the war, we've been alone, and we are thankful.""Trump also weighed in, asserting that Ukraine ""would have been over in two weeks"" if not for the military aid provided by the US. ""If you didn't have our military equipment, this war would have been over in two weeks,"" Trump said.Vance went on to bluntly ask, ""Just say thank you,"" to which Zelenskyy repeated, ""I said it a lot of times thank you to the American people.""""Of course,"" Zelenskyy responded when questioned by Fox News about the possibility of mending relations with Trump.He emphasised that the connection between the United States and Ukraine extends beyond their respective presidents, whilst highlighting Ukraine's critical need for American assistance in confronting Russia's superior military forces.""It will be difficult without your support,"" Zelenskyy stated during his appearance on Fox.Trump had accused Zelenskyy of ""disrespecting America"" in a Truth Social post minutes after their tense Oval Office meeting blow up.""I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was instructed to leave from the White House prematurely following a verbal spat with with US President Donald Trump in the Oval Office, as confirmed by an unauthorised White House staff member speaking off the record, quoted by AP.During the White House meeting on Friday, tensions escalated between Zelenskyy and Trump as they gathered to finalise an agreement regarding Ukraine's mineral resources and explore potential peace negotiations with Russia. The US President issued a stark warning, stating, ""make a deal or we are out.""Subsequently, Zelenskyy departed from the White House premises without signing the crucial minerals agreement that Trump had specified, with Trump indicating that this agreement would determine forthcoming assistance to Ukraine.However, following the tense meeting, Zelenskyy and his team relocated to another room, where the Ukrainian president attempted to salvage the situation and restore the visit's intended course, as per the White House official.The official then revealed that National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio informed the Ukrainian delegation that Trump had requested Zelenskyy's immediate departure from the White House.The heated discussion took place during a critical period for Ukraine, as Zelenskyy sought to secure American backing to counter possible forthcoming Russian military operations.Zelenskyy and Trump anticipated securing a significant deal, which would have provided funding for Ukraine's reconstruction after the war and establish enduring bilateral relations. The agreement, considered a step forward in resolving the three-year conflict, addressed Ukraine's security priorities.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was instructed to leave from the White House prematurely following a verbal spat with with US President Donald Trump.

Suicide blast kills 5 in Pakistan madrasa known as ‘university of jihad’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/suicide-blast-kills-5-in-pakistan-madrasa-known-as-university-of-jihad/articleshow/118637211.cms,"Pakistan blast

ISLAMABAD: At least five people were killed and 20 injured in a suicide blast at a mosque of an Islamic religious school known as the “university of jihad” in Nowshera district of Pakistan’s northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province on Friday.Among the dead were Maulana Hamid-ul-Haq Haqqani , head of Dar-ul-Uloom Haqqania school, the seminary in Nowshera’s Akora Khattak town where key Afghan Taliban leaders have studied. Mullah Omer, the slain founder of the Taliban movement in Afghanistan, was also an alumni of this religious school.Graduates of the seminary include current Afghan Taliban leaders Amir Khan Muttaqi, Sirajuddin Haqqani, Abdul Latif Mansoor, Maulvi Ahmad Jan, Mullah Jalaludin Haqani, Maulvi Qalamudin, Arifullah Arif and Mullah Khairullah Khairkhwa.The explosion occurred in the main prayer hall as people gathered for weekly Friday prayers were leaving the mosque.KP police chief Zulfiqar Hameed confirmed that it was a suicide attack and that three policemen were also injured. “More than a dozen police officers were guarding the mosque when the attack occurred, and Haq’s seminary also had its own security,” he said.“It appears that Hamid Haqqani (seminary’s slain chief) was the target,” Hameed added.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack, which came on the last Friday ahead of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.Yawar Zia, a police constable, who was injured in the attack, said he was on security duty at the seminary when the blast happened and splinters hit him. “After offering prayer, Hamid-ul-Haq, accompanied by his guards, was leaving the mosque when the powerful explosion occurred,” the wounded official said.Eyewitnesses described a chaotic scene, with blood and body parts scattered all over the place. They said the casualties could have been much higher had the bomber struck during the prayers.Haqqani, the son of slain prominent Pakistani cleric Sami-ul-Haq Haqqani, known as the “father of Taliban, was a vice-chancellor of the sprawling seminary, located 60 km from the provincial capital of Peshawar. Following his father’s assassination in 2018, he also became chairman of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Sami (JUI-S) political party. He had also previously served as a member of the National Assembly from 2002 to 2007.Haq was also among the few who called on the world and Pakistan to immediately recognise the Taliban govt and establish diplomatic relations with Afghanistan after the fall of Kabul in 2021.Last year, he led a delegation of religious scholars to Afghanistan for “religious diplomacy” meetings with Taliban leaders.His seminary had faced controversy in the past as its students were accused of involvement in the assassination of Pakistan’s former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto. The madrasa, however, denied any connection with the suspects.","At least five people were killed and 20 injured in a suicide blast at a mosque.

China has signed an agreement with Pakistan to send a Pakistani astronaut to its space station, Tiangong , marking the first time a foreign national will be aboard the facility.The deal was signed in a ceremony held in Islamabad on Friday, between the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) and Pakistan’s Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO). Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was alos present during the ceremony.According to a statement by CMSA, both nations will collaborate on selecting and training Pakistani astronauts, with the chosen candidate expected to join Chinese taikonauts for a short-term mission in the coming years.""This signifies a major step in China’s international space cooperation ,"" reported Global Times, highlighting the growing partnership between Beijing and Islamabad in aerospace advancements.China’s space station, which has been operational for nearly four years, was built after the country was reportedly excluded from the International Space Station (ISS) due to concerns over the involvement of China’s military in its space programme.The station is also seen as a new frontier of competition between China and the US.As per the news agency PTI, the agreement further solidifies China’s support for Pakistan’s space ambitions, following previous collaborations such as the launch of Pakistani satellites.Pakistan’s first digital communications satellite, Badr-1, was launched aboard a Chinese Long March 2E rocket in 1990, while earlier this year, Pakistan’s CubeSat accompanied China’s Chang’e-6 probe to the Moon.According to Global Times, the selection of the astronaut is expected to take around a year, after which the candidate will undergo intensive training in China. This move, experts say, demonstrates the reliability of China's manned space technology and its willingness to lower barriers for developing countries to participate in space exploration .China has also set ambitious goals for space exploration, with plans to land astronauts on the Moon before 2030.Meanwhile, the US has its sights set on returning to the lunar surface by 2025.","China has signed an agreement with Pakistan to send a Pakistani astronaut to its space station, Tiangong.

Clock running out for refugees in Islamabad, Rawalpindi



'We've worked with the Americans for years'



Kabul, Islamabad row amid rising crackdown



Forced to move after decades in Pakistan



UN says Pakistan has a tradition of protecting Afghans

A woman who we will call Fatima fled Afghanistan with her family in December 2021. She had worked for an American non-profit organization in Kabul ­until the US pullout in the summer of 2021, when the Taliban retook control of the country.She is now based in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad. And she is in trouble. Her Pakistani visa is days away from expiring, and the authorities are still processing her renewal application.""I am concerned about the renewal of my visa, and if not renewed timely authorities would arrest me and my family for illegally residing in the country,"" Fatima told DW.Police, including female officers, recently conducted a raid on a building where Fatima lives, looking for undocumented Afghan refugees. She was not in the building at the time, but her brother ended up in custody.""Later, we showed them our visa renewal application receipts and proof but police did not cooperate,"" said Fatima, who is now hiding from the authorities.In 2023, Pakistan started a massive initiative to repatriate approximately 4 million Afghans who have entered the country over the past 40 years. And while the authorities granted some leeway last year, Pakistan's government has now set a March 31 deadline to expel foreign nationals residing in the country illegally, with search operations ongoing in January and February.Afghan refugees living in Islamabad and the nearby city of Rawalpindi ""have been verbally asked to leave Pakistan till 28th February,"" Umer Gillani, a legal expert and rights activist, told DW.Moniza Kakar, a lawyer working for refugees advocacy in Pakistan, said there was ""uncertainty and fear"" among the Afghani nationals in the area.""Since the start of this year, over 1,000 Afghans have been detained in Islamabad, and more than 18,000 have been forced to leave Islamabad and Rawalpindi because of government orders,"" she said.Amin, 28, is from Kabul. He spent years collaborating with the United States in the fight against the Taliban in Afghanistan, before he too had to flee across the Pakistani border.Hee said he was just days away from being evacuated to America, but this was put on hold last month with President Donald Trump signing an executive order to suspend a refugee resettlement program.Nearly 20,000 Afghans are presently waiting in Pakistan for approval to resettle in the US through an American government program.""We've worked with the Americans for years, we helped and supported them in Afghanistan, we have given them a part of our lives and they have to support us so that we can live peacefully,"" Amin told DW.Over the last three years, Pakistan's relationship with neighboring Afghanistan has deteriorated. Islamabad holds the Taliban authorities in Afghanistan responsible for their inability to control the operations of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group that formed in 2007 and has conducted numerous attacks on Pakistani security forces.As cross-border tensions with the Taliban regime escalate, concerns were also raised about the well-being of Afghans in Pakistan amid reports of purported intimidation and arrests. The UN special rapporteur has expressed his worries, stating that Afghans in the area deserve more humane treatment.Activist Gilani said millions of Afghan refugees in Pakistan are being used as ""hostages to build pressure whenever there is tension between the two countries.""Last week, Pakistan's Foreign Ministry dismissed claims made by the Afghan representation regarding the mistreatment of Afghan refugees in Pakistan, labeling these allegations as ""misplaced"" and urging Kabul to facilitate the smooth repatriation of Afghan citizens.Pakistan has accommodated hundreds of thousands of refugees from its northern neighbor, a situation resulting from decades of regional instability. Afghans who arrived in Pakistan following the Taliban takeover in August 2021 have been relying on visa renewals to stay in the country, a procedure that is costly, uncertain and often subject to significant delays.""The stories of refugees are devastating. Families who have lived in Pakistan for years, even decades, are now being uprooted due to tensions between the two countries. Children, women, and men who have already suffered so much are being treated as if they don't matter. This is not just a refugee crisis, it's a humanitarian crisis,"" said Kakar.UNHCR's top representative in Pakistan, Philippa Candler, told DW that Pakistan already repatriated over 800,000 Afghan refugees between September 2023 and the end of last year.""As of December 2024, Pakistan hosted over 2.8 million Afghans with 69% of refugees living outside refugee villages,"" she said.Candler acknowledged Pakistan's generosity in hosting Afghan refugees for decades, and the current ""economic and security challenges"" in Pakistan that drive the repatriation efforts.At the same time, UNHCR was urging the Islamabad government to ""see the situation of Afghans through a humanitarian perspective"" and ""continue its long-standing tradition of protecting vulnerable Afghans […] regardless of their status.""""It's essential that we work hand-in-hand with both host countries and countries of origin to develop mechanisms that empower refugees to rebuild their lives in safety and dignity, including voluntary repatriation,"" she said.""We are calling for dialogue between the two countries, and for the refugee issue to be separated from political matters.""","Afghan refugees living in Islamabad and the nearby city of Rawalpindi are in trouble.

New York City is terminating a $220m deal with the Pakistan-owned Roosevelt Hotel to house a migrant shelter following a prolonged MAGA meltdown over use of American taxpayer money to facilitate immigration to the US.Under pressure from the federal government and MAGA hardliners, Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat who gravitated to the Trump orbit after facing corruption charges from the Biden administration, announced closure of the site that is said to have housed tens of thousands of migrants in its 1025 rooms at $ 200 a night.The site opened in May 2023 to serve as both a new arrivals center and shelter for asylum seekers under a three-year $ 220 million deal with government-run Pakistan International Airlines, which owns the hotel, having bought out a Saudi stake in it for $ 36.4million in 2005.At peak traffic in 2023 when around 4000 migrants were arriving in the city each week, the sight of asylum seekers camping outside the hotel waiting to be processed triggered MAGA hardliners and even some New Yorkers, as Trump and his supporters complained about Democrats housing ""illegal immigrants"" in ""luxury hotels"" at the expense of US taxpayers.""A taxpayer-funded hotel for illegal migrants is owned by the Pakistani government, which means NYC taxpayers are effectively paying a foreign government to house illegals in our own country. This is nuts,"" Trump acolyte and MAGA major Vivel Ramaswamy had raged.Trump himself, lately exercised over a $ 21 million USAID allocation for a voter turnout program in India, had highlighted the purported scam saying the Biden administration had paid $ 59 million to an unspecified hotel in New York City to house illegal immigrants. Standing beside him, Musk had added that the city was paying double the normal rate for the room.Following the Trump victory, his new administration cited concerns about criminal activity at the hotel for freezing $80 million in FEMA funds to the city, by which time Pakistan had already raked in tens of millions of dollars.""FEMA was funding the Roosevelt Hotel that serves as a Tren de Aragua base of operations and was used to house Laken Riley's killer.

"No passengers, no planes: China-funded $240m Gwadar airport sits idle",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/no-passengers-no-planes-china-funded-240m-gwadar-airport-sits-idle/articleshow/118512631.cms,"Gwadar airport in Pakistan (Pic credit: AP)

With no passengers and no planes, Pakistan's newest and most expensive airport is a bit of a mystery. Entirely financed by China to the tune of $240 million, it's anyone's guess when New Gwadar International Airport will open for business. Located in the coastal city of Gwadar and completed in Oct 2024, its a stark contrast to the impoverished, restive southwestern Balochistan province around it.For the past decade, China has poured money into Balochistan and Gwadar as part of a multibillion dollar project that connects its western Xinjiang province with Arabian Sea, called the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor or CPEC.Authorities have hailed it as transformational but there's scant evidence of change in Gwadar. The city isn't connected to the national grid - electricity comes from Iran or solar panels - and there isn't enough clean water. An airport with a 400,000 passenger capacity isn't a priority for the city's 90,000 people.""This airport is not for Pakistan or Gwadar,"" said Azeem Khalid, an international relations expert who specialises in Pakistan-China ties. ""It is for China, so they can have secure access for their citizens to Gwadar and Balochistan.""CPEC has catalysed a decadeslong insurgency in resource-rich and strategically located Balochistan. Separatists, aggrieved by what they say is state exploitation at the expense of locals, are fighting for independence - targeting Pakistani troops and Chinese workers in the province and elsewhere. Members of Pakistan's ethnic Baloch minority say they face discrimination by govt and are denied opportunities available elsewhere in the country, charges govt denies.Pakistan, keen to protect China's investments, has stepped up its military footprint in Gwadar to combat dissent. The city is a jumble of checkpoints, barbed wire, troops, barricades, and watchtowers. Roads close at any given time, several days a week, to permit the safe passage of Chinese workers and Pakistani VIPs.Intelligence officers monitor journalists visiting Gwadar. Its fish market is deemed too sensitive for coverage.Many locals are frazzled. ""Nobody used to ask where we are going, what we are doing, and what is your name,"" said Khuda Bakhsh Hashim, 76. ""We used to enjoy all-night picnics in the mountains or rural areas. We are residents. Those who ask should identify themselves as to who they are.""Hashim recalled when Gwadar was part of Oman, not Pakistan, and was a stop for passenger ships heading to Mumbai. People didn't go hungry and found work easily, he said.But Gwadar's water has dried up because of drought and unchecked exploitation. So has the work. Govt says CPEC has created some 2,000 local jobs but it's not clear whom they mean by ""local"" - Baloch residents or Pakistanis from elsewhere in the country. Authorities did not elaborate.There is a perception Gwadar is dangerous or difficult to visit - only one commercial route operates out of its domestic airport, three times a week to Karachi, Pakistan's largest city. There are no direct flights to Balochistan's provincial capital of Quetta, or national capital of Islamabad.Security concerns delayed the inauguration of the international airport. There were fears the area's mountains - and their proximity to the airport - could be the ideal launchpad for an attack. Instead, PM Shehbaz Sharif and his Chinese counterpart Li Qiang hosted a virtual ceremony. The inaugural flight was off limits to media and public.","Gwadar is Pakistan's newest and most expensive airport. Entirely financed by China to the tune of $240 million.

When he returned the next day, he got into a fight with the watchman, Khan Zaman, who allegedly stabbed him to death and wounded his brother.As word spread about the murder, a mob milled in the area and burned down five houses in the residential society.Police apprehended the culprit, who was hiding in the basement of a building, and were about to take him away when the mob swooped on him and beat him to death with sticks and stones.Lynchings are common in Pakistan and several instances of mob violence have taken place in the past decade. Many people have been lynched for alleged blasphemy, while mobs have also murdered suspects in street crimes.In June 2024, a suspected robber was lynched by a mob in the southern port city of Karachi. The suspect, armed with a pistol, had attempted to rob a citizen, who put up resistance and was joined by others standing nearby. The mob got hold of the suspect and hit him with blunt weapons, resulting in his death on the spot.In May 2024, another mob lynched a suspected robber in Karachi's Orangi town while police saved his accomplice from being killed.The same month, police rescued a Christian man from angry people, who wanted to lynch him and attacked the homes of other minority members in Punjab’s Sargodha district on charges of alleged blasphemy. Workers at a Sialkot garment factory tortured and burned to death their Sri Lankan general manager in 2023 for alleged blasphemy.","Imran Abbasi, a local, had parked his car in the designated area of a housing society and left for home.

'Airport built for China, not locals'

No direct flight to Quetta or Islamabad

Militancy in Balochistan



Airport inauguration delayed due to security concerns



Pakistan’s newest airport in Gwadar, fully funded by China at a cost of $240 million, remains unused months after its completion in October 2024.Spread over 4,300 acres of land. the airport is Pakistan's largest international airport and was officially opened on January 20 this year. Work started on Gwadar airport in 2019.The Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) PK 503 aircraft was the first commercial flight to arrive at the new airport after its inauguration carrying commercial passengers and high-ranking officials.However, the airport, designed to handle 400,000 passengers annually, has no scheduled flights.The New Gwadar International Airport is part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ), a multi-billion dollar project aimed at linking China’s Xinjiang province with the Arabian Sea. While officials have called it a major development, many in Gwadar say they see little benefit.Gwadar, located in Pakistan's Balochistan province , lacks basic infrastructure such as a stable electricity supply and clean water.""This airport is not for Pakistan or Gwadar,"" Azeem Khalid, an expert in Pakistan-China relations was quoted as saying by the news agency Associated Press (AP). ""It is for China, so they can have secure access for their citizens to Gwadar and Balochistan.""The airport’s construction comes amid ongoing security challenges in Balochistan. Separatist groups in the province oppose what they call exploitation of local resources, targeting both Pakistani security forces and Chinese workers.Pakistan has increased its military presence in Gwadar to protect Chinese investments, leading to more checkpoints and restrictions on movement. Roads are often closed to ensure the safety of Chinese workers and high-ranking officials.""Nobody used to ask where we are going, what we are doing, and what is your name,"" 76-year-old Gwadar resident Khuda Bakhsh Hashim was quoted as saying by the AP. ""We are asked to prove our identity, who we are, where we have come from. We are residents. Those who ask should identify themselves as to who they are.""Authorities claim CPEC has created 2,000 jobs, but there is no clarity on whether these positions were given to local Baloch residents or people from other parts of Pakistan.Gwadar remains largely disconnected, with only one commercial flight route operating three times a week to Karachi. There are no direct flights to Quetta, the provincial capital, or Islamabad.Militancy in Balochistan has increased in recent years, with attacks rising after 2021. Groups such as the Baloch Liberation Army have carried out multiple attacks, particularly after the Pakistani Taliban ended a ceasefire in 2022.Earlier, the airport’s opening was postponed due to security risks. Authorities feared that nearby mountains could be used to launch attacks. Instead, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chinese Premier Li Qiang held a virtual inauguration. The first flight landed without media or public presence.Abdul Ghafoor Hoth, a local leader from the Balochistan Awami Party, said no local residents were hired to work at the airport.""Not a single resident of Gwadar was hired to work at the airport, not even as a watchman,"" he was quoted by AP.Hoth had led protests in December demanding better living conditions in Gwadar. The demonstrations lasted 47 days before authorities promised to address local concerns, including improved access to water and electricity. Since then, no progress has been made on these commitments.","Gwadar airport is Pakistan's largest international airport and was officially opened on January 20 this year.
