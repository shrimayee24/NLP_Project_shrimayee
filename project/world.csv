KANPUR: In a cul-de-sac of Kanpur's Rajendra Mohal stands a small jewellery workshop where a man in his 60s is busy putting a batch of gold samples through chemical tests to ascertain their purity. One of the walls bears a framed photograph of the shop owner's late father Jagdish Prasad, who was an additional district judge in UP.Jagdish Prasad's six children studied law, but only one of them - Pradeep Kumar - completed his LLB.Standing outside his workshop, Sanjay Kumar talks about his 49-year-old law graduate brother with a sense of pride and joy that is tempered by the thought of what he and the family have been through over the past two decades.Pradeep passed the judicial equivalent of the purity test recently when Allahabad HC ""honourably acquitted"" him of the charge of spying for Pakistan.The acquittal paved the way for his appointment as an additional district judge in UP by Jan 15, bringing to a close an ordeal that started in 2002.""We endured a tough time, but justice has prevailed. He (Pradeep) never gave up hope. The stain on our family has been cleansed. I wish our father were alive to witness his youngest son fulfilling his dream of becoming a judge,"" said Sanjay, the second of the six siblings.Sanjay's grandfather, Sukhdev Ram, had moved to Kanpur's Kotwali neighbourhood to master the craft of carving gold, but the latter's son, Jagdish, chose to pursue an LLB degree.After practising law for a decade, he cleared the UP judicial exam to become a judge. Jagdish served in several districts, including Deoria and Hamirpur.""Pradeep was as determined as our father to become a judge. Who could have imagined he would be framed in an espionage case that would stall his career before it could take off? But he never gave up,"" Sanjay said.In June 2002, Pradeep was an unemployed law graduate when a special police taskforce and Military Intelligence arrested him on suspicion of spying for Pakistan and charged him with sedition, criminal conspiracy and violating Official Secrets Act.He was accused of passing sensitive information, such as the names of Army units and officers of Kanpur Cantonment, to a person identified as Faizan Illahi, who used to run a photocopy shop, in exchange for Rs 18,000. During the lengthy trial, neither Military Intelligence nor the police could establish the charges.After being acquitted by a district court in Kanpur in 2014, Pradeep cleared the UP PCS (J) exam in 2016-17, ranking 27th on the merit list. ""But his candidature was presumably rejected because he had been accused of spying. We suspect a neighbour of ours framed him,"" said Sanjay.The HC acquittal came on Dec 6, after which Pradeep left UP with his wife and their four-year-old daughter.Allahabad HC has fined state govt Rs 10 lakh for ""indifferent attitude"" and ""tardiness"" in acting on its recommendation regarding Pradeep's appointment in 2017.","Pradeep Kumar was an unemployed law graduate when a special police taskforce and Military Intelligence arrested him on suspicion of spying for Pakistan.

Supreme Court: How is ‘Jai Shri Ram’ slogan in mosque a crime?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-how-is-jai-shri-ram-slogan-in-mosque-a-crime/articleshow/116379160.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday asked a caretaker to explain how shouting ‘Jai Shri Ram' inside the mosque outraged the religious feelings of his community and became an offence. It, however, sought Karnataka govt's stand on his appeal against quashing of criminal proceedings against the two accused.Appearing for the petitioner, caretaker Haydhar Ali, senior advocate Devadatt Kamat told the bench that shouting such slogans inside a mosque would amount to an attempt to stir communal strife and becomes an offence when accompanied by threat to lives of Muslims.When Kamat, with advocate Javedur Rehman, argued that the HC should have allowed police to complete the probe and not stayed investigations within 20 days of registration of FIR, the bench of Justices Pankaj Mithal and Sandeep Mehta asked, ""Alright, they were shouting a particular religious slogan. How is that an offence?""Kamat said if persons from one faith shouted religious slogans inside the place of worship of another faith, it surely would be an offence. The bench said the FIR was registered based on CCTV footage that detected two persons moving around the mosque.""What is the evidence apart from the CCTV footage to link the two to the incident,"" the bench asked. Kamat said it was for the police to find out who were the persons responsible for disturbing communal harmony and threatening the Muslim community. The bench asked Rehman to serve the petition on the standing counsel for Karnataka to ascertain the state's stand on the appeal by Ali challenging the HC decision.The HC, on Sept 13, had quashed criminal proceedings before a Puttur court in Dakshina Kannada district, saying the FIR did not disclose ingredients of any offence. It was alleged that on Sept 24, 2023, some miscreants entered Badriya Juma Masjid at Aithoor Village, started shouting ‘Jai Shri Ram', and followed with threats that Muslims would not be allowed to live in peace.

A shocking attack at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, left two dead and six others injured after 15-year-old Natalie “Samantha” Rupnow opened fire on Monday. While police revealed Rupnow brought two handguns to the scene, she used only one during the rampage before turning the weapon on herself. The motive behind the attack remains a mystery.Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes confirmed that Rupnow had two firearms in her possession but declined to disclose how she obtained them. ""Bringing a gun to school to hurt people is planning,"" Barnes said, though investigators are unsure if the attack was premeditated or impulsive.Rupnow’s parents, who shared custody of her, are cooperating with the investigation. No charges have been filed against them so far, though authorities are probing how the teen accessed the weapons.The shooting claimed the lives of a teacher and 14-year-old Rubi Patricia Vergara, remembered as an artistic freshman who played in her family’s worship band. Two other students remain in critical condition. The names of the teacher and those injured have not been released.School shootings by female teenagers are almost unheard of, with most perpetrators being young males. Criminology expert Emily Salisbury said Rupnow’s actions suggest possible trauma or severe mental health struggles. ""Girls are rarely violent toward others—it usually takes significant provocation or distress to reach this level,"" Salisbury explained.Frustration is growing over limited updates from authorities. Madison Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway pushed back, urging the media to respect victims' families. ""Let them grieve and heal,"" she said during a tense press conference.However, transparency advocates argue that more information is needed. ""The public has a right to know,"" said Bill Lueders of the Wisconsin Freedom of Information Council.With the FBI now involved, investigators are combing through Rupnow’s online activity and social connections to piece together her motive.

'Gotta be thinking of something while hanging himself'

'Fat version of Liam Payne'

Faith amid tragedy

A 15-year-old Wisconsin high school shooter who killed two and injured six at a conservative Christian school reportedly had a disturbing fascination with death, fueled by her activity on a morbid online forum called “Watch People Die.” Natalie Samantha Rupnow , who later turned the gun on herself, succumbed to her injuries en route to the hospital, leaving behind chilling clues to her state of mind.The shooting occurred at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison on Tuesday during a study hall session. Armed with a handgun, Rupnow opened fire in a classroom, killing a teacher and a teenage student while injuring four others, including three students and a teacher. Investigators have yet to determine her motive but have uncovered a digital trail that paints a haunting portrait of a troubled teen.As per the New York Post report, under the username @Crossixir, Rupnow was an active participant on “Watch People Die,” a graphic site with over three million registered users. The platform hosts videos of fatal incidents, including shootings, suicides, and industrial accidents.In one post, Rupnow commented on a video of a hanging: “Gotta be thinking of something while hanging himself.” When another user asked her to elaborate, she added, “I wonder what a lot of people think before they die, you know? Like just simply if it’s if they want to die at all or just nothing… Only thing I would bother to think of is just do it already if I was killing myself but depends on the situation.”Her posts reflected a morbid curiosity about death and a potential fascination with school shooters, reported the Post. Photos from her father Jeff Rupnow’s Facebook account show Samantha wearing a T-shirt featuring the German industrial band KMFDM—a band linked to Columbine shooter Eric Harris, further fueling speculation that she was inspired by the 1999 massacre.One month before the attack, Rupnow commented on a video of a man jumping through a window, likening it to “a fat version of Liam Payne,” the One Direction singer who tragically fell to his death from a Buenos Aires hotel balcony. Other site content included videos titled “suicidal man offs himself in front of cops” and “worker gets crushed trying to stop a forklift falling over.”By Wednesday morning, @Crossixir had been banned from the site, whose administrator ironically advises users to “log off” and “read a book or something.”Abundant Life Christian School, a founding member of Impact Christian Schools, has expressed unwavering faith in the face of tragedy. Speaking at a press conference, Barbara Wiers, the Elementary and Schools Relations Director, said, “In spite of tragedy, God is working, and we believe that God is good in everything and that he turns beauty into ashes.”Meanwhile, the school community mourns the loss and grapples with the devastating aftermath of an attack by one of their own.","Natalie Samantha Rupnow, 15, opened fire at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, killing two and injuring six.

Recent allegations about ties to a suspected spy

Previous controversy

A woman has claimed that Prince Andrew, Duke of York, stared at her chest during an official crown engagement two decades ago. The incident allegedly occurred when she was 24 and working as an events manager, according to The Sun report. She accompanied a doctor to meet the prince.“He wouldn’t leave me alone,” the unidentified woman told The Sun. She added that Andrew “seemed a lot more inclined to speak to me than the middle-aged female MD.” The Sun showed her a photo from the event, which she says appears to show Andrew looking at her chest. “I must have been listening to my MD talk and was looking her way, so hadn’t noticed him staring,” she explained.“Andrew obviously had other things on his mind.”“He was more interested in looking at my boobs than learning about our business,” she added.The woman wore a low-cut top with a jacket. “I was wearing a low-cut top, but had a jacket on, so wasn’t dressed outrageously,” she clarified, adding, “it was a bit creepy.”The woman's allegations come after recent disclosures about Andrew's ties to Yang, a businessman and suspected spy who has been banned from Britain. The Chinese national, known as ""H6"" in British espionage and media circles, is believed to be one of over 40,000 operatives associated with the department operating worldwide. However, Andrew denies sharing sensitive information with the businessman.Andrew was once regarded as a war hero for his service in Britain’s Royal Navy, during which he flew multiple missions in the 1982 Falklands War against Argentina. In January 2022, Andrew relinquished his military titles and royal roles after his legal team failed to convince a US judge to dismiss a civil lawsuit accusing him of sexual abuse. He later reached a significant financial settlement with Virginia Giuffre, who claimed Andrew abused her when she was 17.Giuffre had alleged that Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell trafficked her to Andrew in the 1990s. Maxwell, currently serving a 20-year prison sentence, was convicted for her role in recruiting and grooming teenage girls for Epstein's abuse.Andrew has consistently denied the allegations against him.",Woman claims Prince Andrew stared at her chest during an official engagement two decades ago.

'Copycat drones'?

President Joe Biden broke his silence over the mysterious drones sighted over New Jersey spreading alarm among the residents and prompting local politicians to call for a probe into them. But what Biden said was not different from the White House and Pentagon's version on the phenomenon. Biden said there was no sense of danger and apparently there's nothing nefarious. ""We’re following this closely, but so far no sense of danger,"" the outgoing president said Tuesday.The statement came as President-elect Donald Trump criticized the reaction of the administration to the mystery drones so far and asserted that it's not possible that the military and President Biden did not know what these drones were actually doing. Trump said he could tell that the drones did not come from enemies as they would have been blasted by now had they pose any threat to America but the government should tell the people what the drones are up to, Trump said.Biden said a lot of drones are authorized to be up there. “I think one started and they all got—everybody wanted to get in the real,"" he said hinting that those who have the authorization are flying the drones and the phenomenon caught up with all those who have the authorization as they too started flying their drones.The FBI, FAA, Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security said in a joint statement Monday that they could not find any nefarious activities behind the drones. Hobbyist drones, law enforcement agencies flew them and combined with helicopters and stars, they made a spectacle which spread terror.“We assess that the sightings to date include a combination of lawful commercial drones, hobbyist drones, and law enforcement drones, as well as manned fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, and stars mistakenly reported as drones,” the agencies said.The first drone was sighted in New Jersey on November 18 and since then hundreds have been spotted triggering panic from the residents and also from local politicians.Several theories came up speculating that the Biden administration deployed them to look for something or they are probably linked to Project Blue Beam -- but there has been no confirmation behind any theory.","Biden said a lot of drones are authorized to be up there in the sky. “I think one started and they all got—everybody wanted to get in the real,"" he said.

US government shutdown looms as Donald Trump blocks bipartisan budget deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-government-shutdown-looms-as-donald-trump-blocks-bipartisan-budget-deal/articleshow/116455123.cms,"Donald Trump (File photo)

US President-elect Donald Trump blocked a bipartisan budget deal on Wednesday, claiming it favored Democrats, bringing the government closer to the verge of shutting down. Trump’s action followed criticism of the bill from billionaire Elon Musk , who encouraged Republicans to oppose it.Trump escalated tensions Wednesday by urging Republicans to reject the bill and instead pass a streamlined funding measure tied to a debt ceiling increase during President Biden’s term. Trump's intervention derailed the bill when he insisted that legislators should approve a ""temporary funding bill WITHOUT DEMOCRAT GIVEAWAYS,"" whilst simultaneously linking it to a debt ceiling increase. ""We should pass a streamlined spending bill that doesn't give Chuck Schumer and the Democrats everything they want,"" Trump declared in his statement.Trump further advocated that Republicans must incorporate the debt ceiling increase within the spending package, ensuring the borrowing limit would rise during President Joe Biden's tenure.He warned that any Republican who supported a funding extension without addressing the debt ceiling would face electoral challenges, stating that those ""would be so stupid"" to do so ""should and will"" confront primary opposition.In a joint statement with Vice President-elect JD Vance, Trump said, “Increasing the debt ceiling is not great but we’d rather do it on Biden’s watch. If Democrats won’t cooperate on a debt ceiling increase now, what makes anyone think they would do it in June during our administration? Let’s have this debate over the debt ceiling now.”Elon Musk further intensified opposition by attacking the bill on social media, describing it as “one of the worst bills ever written.” He later declared, “The voice of the people was heard. This was a good day for America.”Musk further said, ""Any member of the House or Senate who votes for this outrageous spending bill deserves to be voted out in 2 years!"" Musk wrote.With just two days remaining before the deadline, the standoff leaves the government at the brink of a shutdown, threatening vital services and creating uncertainty for millions of Americans.The White House criticized the impasse, warning of severe consequences if the government shuts down. “Republicans need to stop playing politics with this bipartisan agreement or they will hurt hardworking Americans and create instability across the country,” said White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries echoed the sentiment and placed blame on Republicans for the aftermath. “You break the bipartisan agreement, you own the consequences that follow,” he wrote.On the contrary, Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, expressed concern. “There’s got to be a second part of the strategy,” he said. Others, including Rep. Dan Bishop, a North Carolina Republican, celebrated Musk’s influence. “In five years in Congress, I’ve been awaiting a fundamental change in the dynamic,” Bishop posted. “It has arrived.”Trump's move also creates uncertainty for House Speaker Mike Johnson, who negotiated the deal and faces re-election.","US President-elect Donald Trump blocked a bipartisan budget deal on Wednesday, claiming it favored Democrats.

'Don’t say rape': Stephanopoulos reportedly ignored producer’s repeated warnings — Leading to $16 million settlement,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/dont-say-rape-stephanopoulos-reportedly-ignored-producers-repeated-warnings-leading-to-16-million-settlement/articleshow/116455324.cms,"Despite these clear instructions, Stephanopoulos proceeded to make the controversial statement, which ultimately led to the defamation lawsuit filed by Trump against ABC News and the anchor.

The legal fallout and quick settlement

Stephanopoulos' apology and ABC's internal strain

Double-down on ‘rape’

ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos ignored repeated warnings from his producer not to use the word “rape” during a segment discussing Donald Trump—leading to a $16 million defamation settlement, sources have revealed as reported by the New York Post.The incident occurred in March during an interview with Republican lawmaker Nancy Mace on This Week , where Stephanopoulos referred to Trump as ""liable for rape"" in connection with a civil lawsuit won by journalist E Jean Carroll. Sources close to the situation say Stephanopoulos was specifically cautioned not to use the term, with one producer allegedly repeating the warning multiple times before the segment.“‘This Week’ producer said ‘don’t use the word rape’ before the segment started,” an insider said as quoted by the Post. “The EP [executive producer] said it so many times.” A second source confirmed the warning, showing a text message sent to the team that read, ""Don’t say rape.""Despite these clear instructions, Stephanopoulos proceeded to make the controversial statement, which ultimately led to the defamation lawsuit filed by Trump against ABC News and the anchor.The consequences of Stephanopoulos’ decision to ignore the producer’s warnings were severe. Disney, ABC’s parent company, settled the lawsuit last week for $16 million—$15 million of which was directed to a presidential foundation and $1 million to Trump’s attorney fees. The settlement came after a Florida judge rejected a request to delay the case, ordering Stephanopoulos and Trump to sit for depositions just days before Christmas. The judge also demanded the release of Stephanopoulos' communications, including text messages and emails, which could have been damaging for ABC.Legal experts say that Disney’s decision to settle quickly was likely influenced by the potential damage caused by Stephanopoulos' defiance. “If he ignored the producer's warning, it would make it harder for Disney to defend itself in court,” one legal expert said.As part of the settlement, Stephanopoulos was forced to publicly apologize—a decision that left him “apoplectic” and “humiliated,” sources told The Post. Inside ABC News, staff have been calling the anchor “Furious George” in reference to his frustration with the forced apology.“Everyone seems to be asking that question except ABC brass,” a source within the network said, questioning how Stephanopoulos can continue to cover Trump moving forward.The controversy intensified when Stephanopoulos reasserted his use of the word “rape” just days after the lawsuit was filed. Appearing on CBS’ The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, he doubled down on his claim that the word was appropriate, based on comments made by the judge in the New York case.“I’m not going to be cowed out of doing my job because of the threat,” Stephanopoulos said during the appearance.Trump has denied all wrongdoing in relation to Carroll’s allegations, but a New York court had already found him liable for sexual abuse related to an incident in 1996 and later defamation regarding Carroll’s claims.As the dust settles on the legal battle, ABC News and its parent company Disney are left to deal with the fallout from one word—and the heavy cost of ignoring a producer’s warning.","ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos ignored repeated warnings from his producer not to use the word ""rape"" during a segment discussing Donald Trump.

The military’s approach: ""Zap it and put it in a bag""

What makes drones a threat?

Tools and strategies to combat the threat

The bigger picture

A mysterious surge of drone sightings over US military installations has exposed a glaring vulnerability in national defense , with Pentagon officials scrambling to address the growing threat. Recent incursions reveal how foreign adversaries may be exploiting gaps in the military’s authority to neutralize drones outside base perimeters.Infiltrations have become so common that some defense officials advocate for decisive action. ""Zap it, put it in a bag, and exploit it for clues,"" one senior official bluntly suggested, highlighting the need for immediate, hands-on responses to unidentified drones, reported US Today.The Air Force has discreetly employed these tactics, with spokesperson Ann Stefanek confirming drones have been ""taken down"" in recent years. However, operational secrecy limits the details shared with the public.The Pentagon's dilemma stems from jurisdictional limits. While military forces can intercept drones posing threats directly over bases, their authority ends once the aircraft exits restricted airspace, often leaving local law enforcement to handle the situation. In remote areas, this handoff can mean delays—giving adversaries time to gather critical intelligence.Drones can surveil military operations and infrastructure with precision far superior to satellites. Retired Air Force Lt. Gen. David Deptula stressed their potential danger. ""If you get up close to an F-22 fighter jet, you can detect shapes and construction techniques invisible to satellites,"" he explained.Incidents of drones hovering over bases like Langley Air Force Base in Virginia and the Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey suggest adversaries are targeting sensitive assets. Other incursions at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico have disrupted military exercises, while Navy facilities have faced similar surveillance attempts.To combat the drone incursions , the military has deployed advanced counter-drone equipment, including the Dronebuster, a handheld device that jams drone signals. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin recently approved a classified strategy focused on detecting, tracking, and neutralizing drones.Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon Press Secretary, noted that while bases like Picatinny Arsenal and Naval Weapons Station Earle have received upgraded defenses, the broader challenge remains. ""We don't collect intelligence on American citizens,"" Ryder emphasized, underscoring the legal constraints on US soil.This surge in drone activity has drawn comparisons to the 2023 Chinese spy balloon incident, where a surveillance balloon traversed sensitive sites before being shot down. As lawmakers call for expanded counter-drone legislation, the Pentagon warns of the risks drones pose to military readiness and national security.""Drones are more than just nuisances—they’re surveillance tools with potentially lethal intent,"" Deptula warned. The military’s ""zap it and bag it"" approach may be a step forward, but gaps in authority and jurisdiction leave questions about how well the US is prepared for future drone threats.","A mysterious surge of drone sightings over US military installations has exposed a glaring vulnerability in national defense.

A tragic school shooting at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, on Monday claimed the lives of a teacher and a student, leaving two other students critically injured and sparking renewed debates on school safety and gun violence . Police identified 15-year-old Natalie Rupnow , a student at the private Christian academy, as the shooter. Rupnow, who also went by the name Samantha, was found incapacitated when officers arrived just minutes after the 10:57 a.m. 911 call. She was later pronounced dead at a hospital from what authorities suspect was a self-inflicted gunshot wound, though the medical examiner has not confirmed the official cause of death.The violence also resulted in non-life-threatening injuries to three additional students and another teacher, adding to the devastating toll on the tight-knit school community of approximately 420 students. Authorities are actively investigating Rupnow’s background, searching her home, and reviewing her digital footprint for clues to a motive.Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers called the event “heartbreaking,” while President Joe Biden described the shooting as “shocking and unconscionable,” renewing calls for action against the country’s epidemic of school gun violence. With the school days away from its Christmas break, the tragedy has left a community shattered and grappling with unanswered questions.At a December 16 news conference, police identified 15-year-old Natalie Rupnow as the shooter responsible for the fatal attack at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin.Posts and comments from social media accounts linked to Rupnow and her father, Jeff Rupnow, provide a glimpse into her life leading up to the shooting.Jeff Rupnow’s Facebook account includes photos of Natalie as a baby, a smiling child, and participating in activities such as karate competitions, reflecting a seemingly normal upbringing.A notable post from August shows Natalie at a shooting range, wearing protective gear and handling a firearm.

Trump's fresh 51st state nudge as Justin Trudeau faces trouble: 'Many Canadians want...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-fresh-51st-state-nudge-as-justin-trudeau-faces-trouble-many-canadians-want-/articleshow/116441147.cms,"Amid crisis in Canada, Trump reiterates that many Canadians want Canada to be US's 51st state.

'Trump is serious about making Canada 51st state'

Will Canada get a new PM before next year's election?

Donald Trump gave another nudge to the 51st state row at night as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faces fresh trouble in his country following deputy PM and finance minister Chrysia Freeland's resignation. In his night post, Trump said many Canadians want Canada to become the 51st state as he questioned why the United States should subsidize Canada so much. No one can answer why we subsidize Canada to the tune of over $100,000,000 a year? Makes no sense! Many Canadians want Canada to become the 51st State. They would save massively on taxes and military protection. I think it is a great idea. 51st State!!!The 51st state narrative stemmed from the Mar-a-Lago meeting between Trudeau and Trump.Trudeau flew to Florida to meet Trump even before he took over as the President because Trump threatened Canada and Mexico with a 25 per cent tariff -- unless these two neighbors stop sending drugs and illegal immigrants to the US, Trump said. At the meeting which went well, according to both Trump and Trudeau, Trudeau told Trump that Canada's economy will collapse if Trump imposes the tariff. To this, Trump apparently joked and said that in that case Canada could become the 51st state of the United States and Trudeau would become the Governor of this 51st state.While it was a dinner table joke supposed to stay at Mar-a-Lago, it did not as it was widely reported and Trump too publicized it.MAGA supporters cheered after Freeland resigned as it was another blow to the Trudeau government and they credited Trump for delivering the blow as Donald Trump's tariff threat triggered the meltdown in the Trudeau government.After Freeland's resignation, calls for Trudeau's resignation are only growing louder as his resignation, even his allies think, is the only way now as the election will be held in October next year. Freeland cited disagreement with Trudeau as the reason for her exit.Trudeau is reflecting on complaints about his leadership, a close ally said without commenting on the possibility of a resignation. Dominic LeBlanc was named the new finance minister after Freeland's resignation. Trudeau spoke about the turmoil in the leadership at a party event and said, ""We really are a big family. Now like most families, sometimes we have fights around the holidays, but of course, like most families, we find our way through it.""If Trudeau resigns, Freeland could also join the Liberal leadership race to become the prime minister.","Donald Trump reiterates that many Canadians want Canada to be US's 51st state.

Chaos on Royal Caribbean cruise; Man, possibly intoxicated, attacks crew member

A passenger aboard a Royal Caribbean cruise ship died after an altercation with crew members and fellow passengers. Michael Virgil , 35, was on the Navigator of the Seas , sailing from San Pedro, Los Angeles to Ensenada, Baja California, when the incident occurred less than an hour after departure.Virgil allegedly assaulted two crew members, kicking one in the face and punching another, according to a Los Angeles news station, FOX 11. He also reportedly threatened other passengers.A passenger, Christifer Mikhail, recounted the incident, stating, “The gentleman that was drunk said that he was going to kill us. He started chasing us down the hallway.” Mikhail captured video of Virgil attempting to kick open a closet door where a crew member had sought refuge.Virgil attempted to force the door open multiple times, as shown in a video of the incident. He kicked the door with steel-toed boots while shouting profanities, before taking off his shirt in the ship's hallway. He reportedly went on a racial rant, according to a FOX 11 report.“I was kind of scared,” Mikhail said, recounting the incident. “I’m stuck in this hallway. He could have flicked me and thrown me like 30 feet because the guy he punched kinda flew a couple feet back,” he added.Ship security personnel restrained Virgil using zip ties, handcuffs, and either bear or pepper spray, according to Mikhail and his video. Virgil's family told FOX 11 that he was then injected with a sedative and died within an hour.Virgil was traveling with his 7-year-old autistic son and his fiancé, according to a New York Post report.The FBI is investigating the altercation and death. An autopsy is pending to determine the cause of death.Virgil’s family said his behavior was unusual. “He didn’t deserve to die over it,” a relative said, as quoted by New York Post.

Wisconsin School Shooting: Why gender debate overshadowed tragedy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/wisconsin-school-shooting-why-gender-debate-overshadowed-tragedy/articleshow/116405491.cms,"“She, He, or They”: Chief Barnes’ Comments Ignite Outrage



Social Media Divides Over Barnes’ Neutral Stance



Supporters Defend Chief Barnes’ Approach



The Real Tragedy: Gun Violence and Its Victims



A Broader Divide: Identity Politics vs. Action



Moving Forward: Tragedy Amid Polarization



A devastating shooting at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, left two dead and six injured, shocking the nation. In the aftermath of the violence, an unexpected controversy erupted—not about the shooter’s actions, but over their gender identity.The shooter, identified as 15-year-old Natalie Rupnow , who was also known as Samantha, opened fire in a study hall before taking their own life. During a press conference shortly after the tragedy, Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes addressed questions about the shooter’s gender, sparking widespread debate on social media.When asked directly whether Rupnow was transgender, Chief Barnes replied: ""I don’t know whether the shooter was transgender or not. I don’t think that whatever happened today has anything to do with how she or he or they may have wanted to identify. And I wish people would leave their personal biases out of this.""He added: ""Whether or not she was, he was, or they were transgender is something that may come out later. But right now, eight hours after a mass shooting in a Madison school, it is of no consequence.""While Barnes’ comments appeared aimed at steering attention away from identity and toward the tragedy itself, they instead triggered fierce criticism. Many accused him of evading the question and prioritizing political correctness.Social media quickly erupted with outrage. Critics argued that Barnes’ choice to use multiple pronouns muddled the conversation.“Even in the middle of a tragedy, they’re prioritizing political correctness over facts. This is what’s wrong with society today,” one user wrote. “Why dodge the question? Understanding the shooter’s identity could help explain their motives,” another added.“The woke brigade strikes again. It’s a mass shooting, and the police chief sounds like he’s leading a sensitivity workshop,” mocked one commenter. Some users speculated that the hesitation to clarify Rupnow’s gender identity reflected a broader agenda. “They always delay when the shooter might be transgender,” one commenter claimed, citing other shootings that faced similar scrutiny.Amid the backlash, others defended Barnes, arguing that his comments had been taken out of context or constrained by legal protocols for handling minors. “He’s just following the law. You can’t release details about minors unless they’re being charged as adults,” one user explained. “Barnes didn’t say all those pronouns to confuse anyone. He meant it doesn’t matter right now, and critics are twisting his words,” another countered. Defenders also argued that focusing on gender identity detracted from the more pressing issue: the lives lost and the need for meaningful action on gun violence .As debates about pronouns intensified, the tragic reality of the shooting risked being overshadowed. The attack claimed the lives of a teacher and a student, leaving six others injured. Chaos unfolded as students sheltered in place, with a second grader reportedly placing the 911 call that brought first responders to the scene.President Joe Biden addressed the nation following the tragedy, renewing calls for stricter gun laws: ""It is unacceptable that we are unable to protect our children from the scourge of gun violence. We cannot continue to accept this as normal.""The gender identity controversy has once again exposed the deep political and cultural divides in the United States. For some, the debate symbolizes an erosion of clarity and trust.“Why do they try so hard to confuse people? It immediately makes me question their transparency,” one frustrated user remarked.Others pushed back, arguing that identity discussions served as a distraction: “The outrage over pronouns is misplaced. Children and teachers were shot—why are we talking about anything else?”The Wisconsin shooting highlights how even moments of profound grief can become entangled in divisive debates. While families mourn, the focus has shifted from addressing the root causes of gun violence to cultural conflicts over identity and language. The challenge remains: how can communities and leaders focus on solutions to prevent mass violence while avoiding polarizing debates that distract from meaningful action? As the investigation continues, Chief Barnes’ response serves as a reminder of the ongoing tension between clarity, sensitivity, and public expectations in the face of tragedy.",Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes' response to questions about the shooter's gender sparked widespread debate on social media.

New twist in Wisconsin shooting: Who is Alexander Paffendorf?

(AP)

A new angle has emerged in the investigation into a mass shooting at a Wisconsin school, with a 20-year-old man from California now detained for allegedly conspiring with the Madison school shooter. Alexander Paffendorf , of Carlsbad, California, is suspected of plotting to carry out a mass shooting at a government building, in connection with the deadly attack at Abundant Life Christian School earlier this week.According to court records reviewed by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Paffendorf was detained after admitting during an FBI interview that he had communicated his violent plans to 15-year-old Natalie ""Samantha"" Rupnow. Rupnow, who shot and killed one student and one teacher while injuring six others, allegedly received messages from Paffendorf in which he detailed his intentions to arm himself with explosives and firearms for a coordinated attack.""I would arm myself with explosives and a gun and target a government building,"" Paffendorf allegedly told Rupnow, as cited in the emergency gun violence restraining order . The FBI agents investigating the case confirmed they had accessed the disturbing messages between Paffendorf and Rupnow.The details were first reported by CBS 8, adding another layer of complexity to the already harrowing case. While authorities in Wisconsin have yet to comment further, Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes confirmed to the Journal Sentinel that he was unaware of the arrest and deferred questions to the FBI.The California arrest occurred after a San Diego judge approved a restraining order on Tuesday, which mandates Paffendorf to surrender all firearms and ammunition. He is also prohibited from acquiring any new weapons. Within hours of the judge's decision, law enforcement descended on Paffendorf’s Carlsbad apartment complex, where neighbors reported witnessing a tense standoff. ""They had their full guns out all over the street,"" recalled neighbor Alex Gallegos, describing the scene as police cars and officers with guns swarmed the area. ""There were about 15 cops here.""Paffendorf’s court hearing is set for January 3, but questions remain about the nature of his relationship with Rupnow, who was allegedly influenced by him to carry out the shooting at the Christian school. Rupnow, a freshman at Abundant Life Christian School, had brought two handguns to school on Monday, though reports suggest only one weapon was used in the attack.","Alexander Paffendorf, 20, of Carlsbad, California, is suspected of plotting to carry out a mass shooting at a government building.

Wisconsin shooting by Natalie ‘Samantha’ Rupnow joins rare category: Female mass shooters in US are ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/wisconsin-shooting-by-natalie-samantha-rupnow-joins-rare-category-female-mass-shooters-in-us-just-four-in-25-years/articleshow/116453761.cms,"Fatal Wisconsin school shooting by Natalie ‘Samantha’ Rupnow sheds light on rare female mass shooters in US

The deadly shooting at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, on Tuesday has drawn attention not only because of the tragedy it caused but also due to the rare nature of female mass shooters . Fifteen-year-old Natalie “Samantha” Rupnow opened fire at the school, killing a substitute teacher and a student before turning the gun on herself. The attack left five others injured, two of whom remain in critical condition.Rupnow’s actions are part of an alarming but rare trend. According to data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), between 2000 and 2019, only 3.7% of active shooter incidents were committed by women. Similarly, a Justice Department report on mass shootings, defined as incidents with four or more victims, shows that women were responsible for just 2.3% of such attacks from 1966 to 2019.In fact, in the last 25 years, only four out of 200 mass shootings involved female perpetrators, according to the Violence Prevention Project. The rarity of female mass shooters becomes even starker when examining school shootings. Since 1999, only nine female students have committed such acts, an analysis by the Washington Post revealed.While female mass shooters are few, their motivations and behavior are often distinct from their male counterparts. Experts suggest that women tend to be less driven by personal grievances and more likely to engage in ideologically motivated attacks or collaborate in teams, reported the New York Post. However, in Rupnow’s case, authorities have found troubling signs of obsession with previous school shooters, including the Columbine tragedy.Rupnow’s social media activity and images posted on her X account showed her idolizing notorious figures like Eric Harris of Columbine and even referencing other violent incidents, including the Parkland and Jokela school shootings. Such influences have led experts to speculate that female perpetrators, while rare, may be inspired by male-dominated narratives of school violence.Jillian Peterson, founder of the Violence Prevention Project, commented on the role of copycat behavior in school shootings. ""Many school shooters study Columbine,"" Peterson told NPR. ""It’s not surprising to see patterns of influence from past incidents.""As the investigation continues, the case of Natalie Rupnow serves as a stark reminder of how rare but profoundly impactful female mass shooters can be. The tragedy challenges prevailing assumptions about the gender of those who engage in such violence, offering a critical opportunity to further study and prevent future incidents.","Wisconsin school shooting sheds light on rare female mass shooters in US.

Speaker Mike Johnson, who has been working hard to get the bill through, revealed he had spoken to Musk about his concerns.Though Trump has not publicly commented on the bill, two of his top advisers told ABC News that the former president is privately opposed to it. Meanwhile, Republican Senator Mitt Romney has urged Trump to make his position clear. “We can’t vote no on the CR and then keep the government open,” he said, referencing the bill in question.During an interview on Fox & Friends, Speaker Johnson addressed Musk’s criticism and said that he had been in touch with Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who both lead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).Johnson further acknowledged the tight situation with a slim Republican majority in the House, alongside a Democratic-controlled Senate and White House. However, he also stressed that passing this bill was crucial to clearing the way for Trump’s America First agenda when the new Congress begins in January.The proposed bill includes $100 billion in disaster relief for recent hurricanes and another $10 billion to support farmers. Johnson defended the additional spending, arguing that it was necessary to help Americans impacted by natural disasters, as per the ABC News.""It was intended to be, and it was, until recent days, a very simple, very clean [continuing resolution], stopgap funding measure to get us into next year when we have unified government,"" Johnson said. ""We had these massive hurricanes in the late fall, Helene and Milton, and other disasters. We have to make sure that the Americans that were devastated by these hurricanes get the relief they need.""Texas Representative Chip Roy expressed his frustration, saying, “We’re fundamentally unserious about spending. If you can’t shrink the government, you can’t live free.” Musk also mocked the size of the bill, adding to the criticism.As the deadline approaches, Johnson remains determined to get the measure passed. He views it as a temporary fix to prevent a shutdown while ensuring disaster relief, saying, “We’ll get to March, where we can start making bigger changes.”","The billionaire, who has close ties with President-elect Donald Trump, posted on social media X on Wednesday to voice his disagreement.

Harmeet Singh, a Sikh journalist, is also among them,"" an FIA official confirmed to Pakistani outlet Dawn.Over 20 individuals have been arrested so far, accused of sharing controversial social media posts about alleged deaths during the crackdown. The PTI claims that 12 of its supporters were killed by law enforcement, an allegation denied by the government.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has ordered the formation of a joint task force to address what officials have termed as “fake news” about the protest deaths.Charges have been brought under Pakistan’s Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act. The accused are alleged to have spread false information about the events between November 24 and 27, inciting violence against state institutions. Those named include journalists Harmeet Singh, Ahmad Noorani, and several social media activists.The government said that law enforcement did not open fire on protesters and has vowed to take action against anyone spreading misinformation.Amnesty International has called for a transparent investigation into the incident, saying, “Yet again, protesters in Pakistan have faced a brutal and lethal crackdown shrouded in callous opacity by the authorities.” They added, “Urgent and transparent investigation is needed into the deadly crackdown on protesters. We demand a prompt, thorough, impartial, effective, and transparent investigation into the deaths and injuries of protesters.”The PTI organised the November 26 march in Islamabad to protest against former Pakistan PM Imran Khan's detention, defying a ban on public gatherings. Clashes broke out between protesters and security forces, with authorities using tear gas to disperse the crowd.","Pakistan's federal investigation agency has initiated legal action against over 150 individuals, including journalists and vloggers.

Pak SC conditionally allows army to announce military trial verdicts of pro-Imran protesters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pak-sc-conditionally-allows-army-to-announce-military-trial-verdicts-of-pro-imran-protesters/articleshow/116298908.cms,"Supreme Court of Pakistan

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s Supreme Court on Friday allowed military courts, though conditionally, to announce the reserved verdicts of 85 civilians tried for alleged involvement in last year’s May 9 riots when protesters linked to the Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) had stormed govt and military installations.A seven-member SC constitution bench, headed by Justice Aminuddin, specified that the military court verdicts would be subject to its final decision on appeals against its Oct 23, 2023 ruling barring the army from trying PTI protesters, saying military trials of civilians were unconstitutional.Local and international human rights organisations have expressed concern about the military trials, claiming that they do not adhere to the same evidentiary and due process norms as civilian courtsHundreds of PTI workers were arrested after they purportedly stormed military and govt buildings, and even torched a top commander’s house, following the former PM’s brief arrest by paramilitary soldiers on May 9, 2023 in a graft case. Among the detainees, the army initiated military trials against 103 accused on charges of treason and attempting to incite mutiny in the military. Though Khan was released after three days, he was rearrested two months later in another corruption case and has been in jail since. There have been widespread reports that the military also plans to prosecute him under the same charges. He, however, has already been indicted by an anti-terrorism court over charges linked to the May 9 riots.The seven-member SC constitution bench was formed as a result of a controversial amendment to the constitution in Oct this year.“The final judgment of 85 persons who are under custody and facing trial before the military courts be announced and remissions admissible to the said persons be granted, and persons who can be released after remissions they be released forthwith, and persons who have to yet undergo the sentence awarded to them, their custody be handed over to the concerned jail authorities,” Friday’s court order read.The Pakistan Army Act of 1952 had established military courts, which function under a separate legal system, primarily for trial of military personnel or enemies of the state.The decision to use military courts for civilians was taken by Imran’sadversary, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, during his first term in office, and was backed by the powerful military establishment.","Pakistan’s Supreme Court on Friday allowed military courts, though conditionally, to announce the reserved verdicts of 85 civilians tried for alleged involvement in May 9 riots.

Bin Laden, Tehran and the Taliban



'Murdered my dreams'



PARACHINAR: Once again, Ali Ghulam receives mourners at his home -- his brother and nephew killed 40 years apart in the same sectarian conflict that was reignited this year in northwest Pakistan, claiming 200 lives since July alone.Thousands of residents are stranded without food and medicine in parts of remote Kurram district, which borders Afghanistan, as the government struggles to end clashes between Sunni and Shiite Muslims stemming from decades-old tensions over farmland.""Our generations yearn for peace,"" 72-year-old Ghulam told AFP at his home in Parachinar, the main town and a Shiite bastion of the restive district.The latest flare-up of violence has ""reopened wounds"" he said, recalling how his brother was killed in an attack in 1987 that also wounded another three of his brothers.Kurram, known as the ""Parrot's Beak"" for its protrusion into neighbouring Afghanistan, is bounded by dizzyingly high mountains, the northern flank of which includes the Tora Bora caves where Al Qaeda founder and 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden once hid.Pakistan's northwestern border districts have long been a haven for various militant groups, with militants and weapons able to flow largely unchecked in and out of Afghanistan.""I have never experienced peace in my life and have no hope my coming generations will live free of fear,"" Ghulam said.Tribal and family feuds are common in Pakistan.But they can be particularly protracted and violent in the mountainous tribal northwest, where communities live by traditional codes of honour and revenge.The latest round of violence in Kurram erupted in May and intensified in July, when gunmen opened fire on a council of elders attempting to settle the latest round of disagreements over land.Various truces announced since then have held for only weeks or days at a time.More than 300 shops and over 200 homes in Sunni areas have been destroyed, often by fire, and hundreds of families have fled.Pakistan is a Sunni-majority country with Shiites making up 10 to 15 percent of the population, or at least 25 million people.Members of the two sects have periodically clashed in Kurram, where Shiites are particularly vulnerable as they must pass through Sunni-majority neighbourhoods to access essential services.Kurram's location on the frontier of Pakistan and Afghanistan put it at the heart of the religious and political upheavals of the last five decades.In 1979, Shiites led a revolution in Iran and later that year the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, prompting Sunni hardliners there to rise up against them.Pakistan's military ruler Zia-ul-Haq aligned with them, funnelling thousands of Sunni militants into Afghanistan through Kurram.""It became a hub for arms supply to Afghanistan, including landmines, mortar shells, and weapons of all kinds. Every household in Kurram had a stockpile of weapons,"" Malik Attaullah Khan, a local tribal elder told AFP.Khan, who signed a 2007 agreement aimed at bringing peace to Kurram, criticised the government for failing to ""fulfil in its responsibilities"" in enforcing land settlements.The ethnic Pashtun heartland was merged into the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in 2018, but the Pakistani state maintains limited control in the merged districts.In rural areas of Pakistan, villages often bypass the formal justice system and men-only ""jirgas"" or councils made up of respected village elders resolve disputes, sometimes in the form of fines or land reallocation.Ghulam's nephew was killed along with at least 42 others last month, when Sunni gunmen opened fire on a convoy of Shiites being escorted by the police to their homes.In retaliation, a market in a Sunni-dominated area was set on fire.Syed Ghani Shah told AFP his cousin was burned to death inside his shop.""When we buried him, he was so unrecognisable that we couldn't even let his parents see his face,"" Shah said.""Can we ever make peace after all this? Never, if we ever get the chance, we will surely avenge our blood,"" he warned.Authorities have enforced curfews and road closures to reduce the chances of violence breaking out, providing escorts through high-risk areas and using helicopters to deliver supplies.But Akbar Khan, a representative of Pakistan's independent Human Rights Commission told AFP that the state needs to do more to resolve the issue.""In the past, jirgas were successful because they had the full support of the state. Now, the authorities don't even provide the expenses needed to hold a jirga,"" he said.Fatima Ahmed's husband was killed last month while travelling to Islamabad to arrange her admission to medical college.""I don't want to live a life without him. I've lost my will to exist,"" the 21-year-old told AFP.""They haven't just martyred my husband -- they've also murdered my dreams with him,"" she said, bursting into tears.",Violence in northwest Pakistan has killed 200 people since July.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's former Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), has been formally indicted on a number of charges, including engaging in political activities and violating a law on official secrets, during field general court martial (FGCM) proceedings against him, military's media affairs wing said Tuesday.Army's media arm ISPR said FGCM also charged Hameed with compromising state security and interests, abusing authority and resources and causing undue harm to individuals. ISPR said proceedings against Hameed were initiated on Aug 12 under provisions of Pakistan Army Act.Hameed, who served as ISI director-general from June 2019 to Oct 2021, was taken into custody from Rawalpindi four months ago when he was summoned to a meeting by a senior military officer. He was arrested over accusations about his involvement in land grabbing and snatching valuables and property from the owner of a private housing society. His arrest busted the myth that ISI chiefs were untouchable in a country where powerful generals have long wielded unparalleled influence in state affairs.""During the process, involvement of Lt Gen Faiz Hamid (Retd) in events related to creating agitation and unrest, leading up to multiple incidents including but not limited to the May 9, 2023 incident for fomenting instability, at the behest of and in collusion with vested political interests, is also being separately investigated,"" ISPR said. The May 9 incident referred to countrywide protests when PTI supporters stormed army installations and govt buildings following the arrest of party chief and ex-PM Imran Khan for alleged graft. To many, Hameed's close association with Khan was the reason behind his arrest. Khan wanted to continue with Hameed as ISI head but then army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa had been adamant on replacing him. Bajwa eventually succeeded and Khan could serve only a few months in office; he was later removed through a no-confidence.Independent observers say action against Hameed could put Khan under pressure and pave the way for the ex-PM to face a military court on charges of treason and attempting to incite mutiny in the military.","Pakistan's former Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), has been formally indicted on a number of charges.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan ’s imprisoned ex-prime minister Imran Khan has threatened to launch a nationwide civil disobedience movement, in an apparent bid to keep his public mobilisation campaign intact and to force the country’s powerful authorities to agree to his demands.Less than two weeks after his “final call” protest in Islamabad was violently suppressed, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief has asked his supporters to converge on Dec 13 in the northwestern city of Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, to pay homage to party workers who were killed in the crackdown by security forces in Islamabad.His call for protest in Islamabad had mobilised thousands of supporters, primarily from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a province governed by his party. Imran’s party is believed to have organised the Dec 13 gathering in Peshawar keeping in mind his popularity in the region.Imran has also constituted a five-member team to discuss two key demands with govt: release of undertrial prisoners and a judicial probe into the crackdown on the Nov 26 protest march and the violence on May 9 last year. On both dates, PTI workers and Imran’s supporters held major protests, but faced a backlash from govt and security forces.“If these two demands are not accepted, a civil disobedience movement will begin on Dec 14. Govt will bear full responsibility for the consequences,” the PTI chief’s post in Urdu read.“As part of the movement, we will urge overseas Pakistanis to limit remittances and start a boycott campaign. In the second phase, we will escalate our actions further,” he added.The announcement followed Imran’s recent indictment for his involvement in an attack on military headquarters on May 9 last year, while he was also slapped with charges of terrorism for his role in protests that besieged Islamabad last month.Meanwhile, data submitted before the Islamabad high court revealed that the 72-year old cricketer-turned-politician is currently facing 188 criminal cases and inquiries. According to the data, he has been booked in 99 cases in Punjab, 76 in Islamabad and two in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.",Imran Khan has asked his supporters to converge in Peshawar on Dec 13.
