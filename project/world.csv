'Restrict non-essential movement': Indian embassy issues advisory after violence erupts in Kenya,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/restrict-non-essential-movement-indian-embassy-issues-advisory-after-violence-erupts-in-kenya/articleshow/111270750.cms,"NEW DELHI: Indian embassy in Kenya issued an advisory on X (formerly Twitter), cautioning Indian citizens residing in the country amidst the ongoing unrest. The post stated, ""In view of the prevailing tense situation, all Indians in Kenya are advised to exercise utmost caution, restrict non-essential movement and avoid the areas affected by the protests and violence till the situation clears up. Please follow local news and Mission's website and social media handles for updates.""The advisory comes in the wake of violent confrontations between protesters and police forces in various cities across Kenya, including the capital, Nairobi. The clashes erupted following the Kenyan parliament's approval of a contentious finance bill that introduces tax increases , further exacerbating the nation's already dire cost-of-living crisis.According to eyewitness accounts, security forces resorted to using tear gas, water cannons, and firing shots above the heads of protesters in an attempt to disperse the crowds. In response, demonstrators hurled stones at the police. As the parliamentary debate on the tax bill unfolded, riot police formed a perimeter around the parliament building and the State House, which serves as the president's office and residence. The bill was ultimately passed, and the parliament subsequently adjourned, even as protesters assembled outside the building.The demonstrations reflect the growing discontent among Kenyans, who are not only opposed to the tax hikes but also demanding the resignation of President William Ruto. The country is currently grappling with a severe economic crisis , and the new tax measures have further fueled public anger and frustration.","The advisory comes in the wake of violent confrontations between protesters and police forces in various cities across Kenya, including the capital, Nairobi.

"Porsche teen's remand illegal, says Bombay HC, orders his release",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/porsche-teens-remand-illegal-says-bombay-hc-orders-his-release/articleshow/111267670.cms,"MUMBAI: The continuation of the minor accused in the Pune Porsche case in an observation home is absolutely illegal, Bombay HC held on Tuesday, directing his release. HC directed the home to release the minor on bail with his custody not to be with any grandparent.The Juvenile Justice Board had, while granting bail to the minor on May 19, ordered that he be handed over to the grandparents' custody after his grandfather gave an undertaking.HC said he could be handed over to the care of his aunt, who filed a habeas corpus plea in HC for his release alleging illegal detention. The aunt lives in New Delhi.""We are bound by law, the aims and objectives of the Juvenile Justice (care and protection of children) Act, and must treat him as any child in conflict with law (CCL), despite the seriousness or heinousness of the crime,"" said a two-judge bench of Justices Bharati Dangre and Manjusha Deshpande.The teen was allegedly speeding in his luxury car in an intoxicated state on May 19 when it crashed into a bike, killing two software engineers, Aneesh Awadhiya and Ashwini Koshta.HC said the immediate reaction to the accident, the outcry of the public, and the ""clarion call given"" led to the prosecution seeking to try him as an adult. ""His age needs to be considered... CCLs are to be considered differently, and not as adults. We allow the habeas corpus and order his release,"" the court said. Reading out the operative part of the judgment, the bench said, ""A demand is made by the prosecution to accuse him of a heinous offence and try him as an adult which may receive due consideration.""HC asked public prosecutor H S Venegaonkar under which legal provision teen was sent back to observation home after his release on bail. HC reasoned that in the absence of the Juvenile Justice Act of 2015 providing for the juvenile's remand, ""the procedure adopted by the Board in extending"" his remand under CrPC was ""not applicable in case of a child who is already released on bail"".Speaking of ""the rehabilitation and reintegration of the child in conflict with law,"" HC said that is ""the primary object of the Act"" and ""he is already referred to a psychologist and is undergoing therapy with a de-addiction centre, and he shall continue participating in such sessions.""","HC said the immediate reaction to the accident, the outcry of the public, and the ""clarion call given"" led to the prosecution seeking to try him as an adult.

Suspected Houthi attacks target a ship in Gulf of Aden and Israeli port city of Eilat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/suspected-houthi-attacks-target-a-ship-in-gulf-of-aden-and-israeli-port-city-of-eilat/articleshow/111271388.cms,"DUBAI: Suspected attacks by Yemen 's Houthi rebels early Wednesday targeted a ship in the Gulf of Aden and the southern Israeli port city of Eilat, authorities said.The attacks follow the departure of the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower after an eight-month deployment in which the aircraft carrier led the American response to the Houthi assaults. Those attacks have reduced shipping drastically through the route crucial to Asian, Middle East and European markets in a campaign the Houthis say will continue as long as the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip rages.The ship attack happened off the coast of Aden, the British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center said.The captain “of a merchant vessel reported a missile impacted the water in close proximity to the vessel,” the UKMTO said. “The crew are reported safe and the vessel is proceeding to its next port of call.”The UKMTO did not say if the ship had been damaged.Meanwhile, the Israeli military early Wednesday said a drone “fell off the coast of Eilat.” The military activated air raid sirens in the area.The drone “was monitored by (Israeli) soldiers throughout the incident and it did not cross into Israeli territory,” the Israeli military said. “During the incident, an interceptor was launched toward the” drone.The Houthis have targeted Eilat before with drones and missiles.The Houthis did not immediately claim either attack. However, it can take the rebels hours or even days before they acknowledge their assaults.The rebels have targeting more than 60 specific vessels by firing off missiles and drones in their campaign that has killed a total of four sailors. They have seized one vessel and sunk two since November. A U.S.-led airstrike campaign has targeted the Houthis since January, with a series of strikes on May 30 killing at least 16 people and wounding 42 others, the rebels say.The Houthis have maintained that their attacks target ships linked to Israel, the United States or Britain. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the Israel-Hamas war — including those bound for Iran.Late Tuesday, Houthi military spokesman Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree claimed an attack Monday on the Liberian-flagged, Greek-managed container ship MSC Sarah V. Saree claimed without offering additional evidence that the Houthis used a new ballistic missile in the assault, which targeted a ship farther away from nearly all of the previous assaults they’ve launched in the Gulf of Aden.","The ship attack happened off the coast of Aden, the British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center says.

"Israeli SC orders army to draft ultra-Orthodox men, rattling Bibi govt",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israeli-sc-orders-army-to-draft-ultra-orthodox-men-rattling-bibi-govt/articleshow/111270852.cms,"JERUSALEM: The Israeli Supreme Court unanimously ordered the government to begin drafting ultra-Orthodox Jewish men into the army - a landmark ruling seeking to end a system that has allowed them to avoid enlistment into compulsory military service .Roughly 1.3 million ultra-Orthodox Jews make up about 13% of Israel's population and oppose enlistment because they believe that studying full time in religious seminaries is their most important duty.An enlistment exemption for the ultra-Orthodox goes back to the founding of Israel in 1948, when small numbers of gifted scholars were exempt from the draft. But with a push from politically powerful religious parties, those numbers have swelled over the decades. The court said the exemptions were illegal in 2017, but repeated extensions and government delay tactics have prevented a replacement law from being passed.Two parties belonging to the Haredim, or ""god-fearing"" in Hebrew, are essential parts of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's fragile coalition, but the broad exemptions from mandatory military service have reopened a deep divide in the country and infuriated much of the general public during the war in Gaza. Over 600 soldiers have been killed since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. Many reserve soldiers are starting their second tour of duty.What does Tuesday's ruling mean for Netanyahu's government? Netanyahu's coalition holds a slim majority of 64 seats in the 120-member parliament, often requiring him to capitulate to the demands of smaller parties like the ultra-Orthodox.If those parties leave the government, the country would likely be forced into new elections this fall. Netanyahu's popularity is low as the war in Gaza drags into its ninth month.Housing Minister Yitzhak Goldknopf heads one of the ultra-Orthodox parties in Netanyahu's coalition. In a post on X, Goldknopf called the Supreme Court's ruling ""very unfortunate and disappointing,"" but did not say whether his party would leave the government. The chairman of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, Aryeh Deri, denounced the ruling and said religious study was ""our secret weapon against all enemies.""The court this year temporarily froze state subsidies for seminaries where exempted ultra-Orthodox men study. Along with the enlistment decision, the court also ruled Tuesday that that money should be permanently suspended.Many religious seminaries depend on government funding and ""the general assumption is that the government will not survive this crisis,"" said Barak Medina, a law professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and an expert on constitutional law.What did the courts rule? Military service is compulsory for most Jewish men and women, who serve three and two years, respectively, in active duty, as well as reserve duty until around age 40.The Israeli Supreme Court ruled that compulsory military service applies to the ultra-Orthodox just like any other Israeli. The judges said that allowing a certain community a ""sweeping avoidance"" of service amounted to discrimination.""Discrimination regarding the most precious thing of all - life itself - is the worst kind,"" the justices wrote in their opinion.In 2017, the Supreme Court struck down a law that codified draft exemptions. Repeated extensions of the law and government tactics to delay a replacement law have dragged on for years.Israel's judiciary plays a large role in checking the government's executive power. Netanyahu attempted to overhaul the judiciary last year, spurring massive protests across the country before a major part of the overhaul was struck down.When will this go into effect? It will be challenging for the army integrate a larger number of ultra-Orthodox deeply opposed to service into its ranks.Among Israel's Jewish majority, mandatory military service is largely seen as a melting pot and a rite of passage. The ultra-Orthodox say that integrating into the army will threaten their generations-old way of life, and that their devout lifestyle and dedication to upholding the Jewish commandments protect Israel as much as a strong army does.The courts did not set numbers for enlistment in their ruling, but Israel's attorney general's office suggested that at least 3,000 ultra-Orthodox soldiers enlist in the coming year. The court said in its ruling that some 63,000 ultra-Orthodox students are eligible for enlistment.For decades, the army has attempted to accommodate ultra-Orthodox soldiers by creating separate units that allow them to maintain religious practices, including minimizing interaction with women. One of the units created for this purpose, Netzah Yehudah, faced possible U.S. sanctions over their treatment of Palestinians, though the U.S. eventually decided not to impose sanctions.What impact will this have on the war in Gaza? The ruling will have little immediate effect on the war in Gaza, where more than 37,600 Palestinians have been killed, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The number of ultra-Orthodox who might enlist because of the ruling is too small to have a significant impact on day-to-day fighting.Medina, the law professor, said that if the ruling topples the government, it could give Netanyahu more leeway to reach a deal for a ceasefire that could end the war in Gaza.""Currently, one of the main reasons he's prevented from reaching an agreement for the end of the war is because it will mean the end of his coalition,"" said Medina.If the ultra-Orthodox parties leave the coalition, Netanyahu has ""nothing to lose,"" he said. And that could lead to a change in policy without the pressure from far-right ministers opposed to any kind of ceasefire. Netanyahu will also be under a lot of pressure to wrap up fighting if early elections are called, to avoid going into the elections without the hostages and while a war is still ongoing, Medina said.","Roughly 1.3 million ultra-Orthodox Jews make up about 13% of Israel's population. They oppose enlistment because they believe that studying full time in religious seminaries is their most important duty.

Brazil's Supreme court votes to decriminalize marijuana possession for personal use,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/brazils-supreme-court-votes-to-decriminalize-marijuana-possession-for-personal-use/articleshow/111267687.cms,"Brazil's Supreme Court voted on Tuesday to decriminalize the possession of marijuana for personal use, making it one of the last countries in Latin America to do so. This move has the potential to significantly reduce the country's massive prison population .The justices must still determine the maximum quantity of marijuana that would be considered for personal use and when the ruling will take effect, which is expected to be finalized as early as Wednesday.As per the news agency Associated Press (AP), The justices who voted in favor of decriminalization emphasized that it should be limited to possession of marijuana in amounts suitable for personal use, while selling drugs will remain illegal. In 2006, Brazil's Congress passed a law that aimed to punish individuals caught with small amounts of drugs, including marijuana, with alternative penalties such as community service.However, the law was criticized for being too vague and failing to establish a specific quantity to help law enforcement and judges differentiate between personal use and drug trafficking.""The majority of pre-trial detainees and those convicted of drug trafficking in Brazil are first-time offenders, who carried small amounts of illicit substance with them, caught in routine police operations, unarmed and with no evidence of any relationship with organized crime,"" said Ilona Szabó, president of Igarapé Institute, a think tank focusing on public security.Congress has responded to the Supreme Court's ongoing deliberations by separately advancing a proposal to tightendrug legislation , which would complicate the legal picture surrounding marijuana possession. In April, the Senate approved a constitutional amendment criminalizing possession of any quantity of illicit substance, and the lower house's constitutional committee approved the proposal on June 12. If lawmakers pass such a measure, the legislation would take precedence over the top court's ruling but could still be challenged on constitutional grounds.The Supreme Court's ruling has been long sought by activists and legal scholars in a country where the prison population has become the third largest in the world, behind the United States and China. Critics of current legislation argue that users caught with even small amounts of drugs are regularly convicted on trafficking charges and locked up in overcrowded jails, where they are forced to join prison gangs. ""Today, trafficking is the main vector for imprisonment in Brazil,"" said Cristiano Maronna, director of JUSTA, a civil society group focusing on the justice system.As of December 2023, approximately 852,000 individuals were deprived of liberty in Brazil, according to official data. Nearly 25 per cent of them were arrested for possession of drugs or trafficking. Brazilian jails are overcrowded, and Black citizens are disproportionately represented, accounting for more than two-thirds of the prison population. A recent study by Insper, a Brazilian research and education institute, found that Black individuals found by police with drugs were slightly more likely to be indicted as traffickers than white people.While medicinal use of cannabis in Brazil is allowed, it is highly restricted. Uruguay has fully legalized the use of marijuana, and in some US states, recreational use for adults is legal. In other Latin American countries, such as Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, possession has been decriminalized, but selling marijuana for recreational purposes remains illegal.Argentina's Supreme Court ruled in 2009 that it was unconstitutional to penalize an adult for consuming marijuana if it didn't harm others, but the law has not been changed, and users are still arrested, although most cases are thrown out by judges.",Brazil's Supreme Court voted on Tuesday to decriminalize the possession of marijuana for personal use.

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange pleads guilty in deal with US securing his freedom,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/wikileaks-julian-assange-plea-deal-hearing-begins-in-saipan-part-of-deal-with-us-to-secure-his-freedom/articleshow/111270411.cms,"WikiLeaks says Assange to fly to Canberra within hours

What did WikiLeaks publish that sparked controversy?

NEW DELHI: WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , admitted to one felony count related to the publication of classified US military information. The plea agreement, reached with prosecutors from the Justice Department, ensures his release and brings an end to a prolonged legal battle that sparked contentious debates surrounding press freedom and national security concerns.""Guilty to the information,"" Assange said, later joking to the judge during the proceedings that whether he is satisfied ""depends on the outcome of the hearing"".Assange, dressed in a black suit and ochre-colored tie with his hair slicked back, was present at the hearing in the Northern Mariana Islands, a Pacific US territory.The deal, disclosed Monday night in court papers, represents the conclusion of a more than decade-long legal journey for Assange, whose popular secret-sharing website made him a champion among press freedom advocates who believed he acted as a journalist to expose US military wrongdoing. However, US prosecutors have argued that his actions recklessly endangered the country's national security.Although the deal with prosecutors requires Assange to admit guilt to a single felony count, it also allows him to avoid serving any time in an American prison. He will receive credit for the five years he has already spent in a high-security British prison while fighting extradition to the US to face charges. Prior to his imprisonment in London, Assange spent years hiding out in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London to avoid extradition to Sweden to face allegations of rape and sexual assault, which he has denied.Assange, is set to fly to Canberra, Australia, in the coming hours, according to a statement released by WikiLeaks on Wednesday.According to the social media post by WikiLeaks, Assange is ""Expected to depart in 2 hours, 58 minutes. To Canberra, Australia."" The plea deal is anticipated to pave the way for his release and subsequent journey to the Australian capital.In April 2010, WikiLeaks published a video depicting a US helicopter attack in Baghdad from 2007, which resulted in the deaths of twelve individuals, including two journalists from Reuters. The release of the classified video led to the arrest of Bradley Manning, a US military specialist, in June.Subsequently, in July, WikiLeaks disclosed over 91,000 documents, primarily consisting of confidential US military reports pertaining to the war in Afghanistan. This was followed by the release of approximately 400,000 classified US military files in October, which detailed the Iraq war from 2004 to 2009.These disclosures constituted the most extensive leaks of their kind in the history of the US military. Later in the same year, WikiLeaks released thousands of US diplomatic cables, which contained frank assessments of foreign leaders and candid evaluations of security threats. Among these cables were messages from the former king of Saudi Arabia, Abdullah, ""repeatedly urging the United States to attack Iran's nuclear program"" and others concerning China orchestrating cyberattacks against the United States.","WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange admitted to one felony count related to the publication of classified US military information.

Trump's attorneys accused of 'hijacking' classified documents hearing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-attorneys-accused-of-hijacking-classified-documents-hearing/articleshow/111271475.cms,"NEW DELHI: Donald Trump 's classified documents case reached a heated conclusion after prosecutor for special counsel Jack Smith accused former President's lawyers of hijacking the hearing with far-fetched allegations about the case.On the third and final day of the hearing, the prosecutor accused Trump's legal team of ""hijacking"" the proceedings with far-fetched allegations unrelated to the matters before the court. US District Judge Aileen Cannon quickly intervened, stating, ""There is no hijacking going on -- it's about to end.""According to ABC news, Judge Cannon convened the hearings to consider the defense's requests for case dismissal and limitations on prosecutors' use of selected evidence. Trump, who pleaded not guilty last year to 40 criminal counts related to his handling of classified materials after leaving the White House, has denied all charges and called the probe a political witch hunt.During the 90-minute hearing, Cannon appeared skeptical of the defense's arguments that the evidence seized from Mar-a-Lago should be tossed due to a lack of specificity in the search warrant. She repeatedly told Trump's lawyers that their arguments seemed ""far afield"" and that she was ""unclear"" about how they believed the warrant and search should have been conducted.Trump's lawyers argued that the FBI agents were given vague instructions, the search warrant affidavit omitted key details, and the raid went too far by including searches of the bedrooms of Trump's wife and youngest son. However, Cannon questioned the relevance of the property's size and pushed the prosecutor to explain why the search extended to the bedrooms, ABC news reported.The prosecutor, David Harbach, admitted there was no direct evidence of boxes being moved to the child's room but argued that it would have been irresponsible not to search there given the belief that Trump stored boxes in odd locations. He insisted that there was no rummaging during the search.Cannon appeared unconvinced by the defense's argument that prosecutors made significant omissions in the search warrant application, remarking that she was ""failing to see why adding into the affidavit the undisputed and obvious point"" would make a difference. She emphasized that the key issue was Trump's post-presidency handling of classified documents.according to the report, despite Cannon's previous rulings supporting the defense, she signaled a willingness to side with prosecutors on the issue of the search, stating that she had a ""hard time"" buying the defense's argument. The hearing grew tense as both sides made their arguments, with Cannon urging them to stay focused on the motion at hand.The admissibility of notes by Trump's former lead attorney, Evan Corcoran, was not addressed during the public portion of the hearing, but Cannon noted that the topic of ""presumptively privileged material"" was discussed under seal during the morning session.Judge Cannon concluded the hearing without issuing any ruling from the bench, leaving the outcome of the defense's requests uncertain.","Donald Trump's classified documents case reached a heated conclusion after prosecutor accused former President's lawyers of hijacking the hearing.

Under the plea deal, the 52-year-old will escape a potentially lengthy sentence in the US. If he had been convicted, Assange could have faced a maximum of 170 years in a federal prison.The plea deal brings an abrupt conclusion to a criminal case of international intrigue and to the US govt's yearslong pursuit of a publisher whose hugely popular secret-sharing website made him a cause celebre among many press freedom advocates who said he acted as a journalist to expose US military wrongdoing. US prosecutors, in contrast, have asserted that his actions broke law and put the nation's security at risk.WikiLeaks came to prominence in 2010 after it released hundreds of thousands of classified US military documents on Washington's wars in Afghanistan and Iraq along with swaths of diplomatic cables. The trove of more than 700,000 documents included battlefield accounts such as a 2007 video of a US Apache helicopter firing at suspected insurgents in Iraq, killing a dozen people including two Reuters news staff. That video was released in 2010.Negotiations toward a plea agreement heated up in recent months after Prez Biden said he was considering a request from the Australian govt to strike a deal. However, a White House National Security Council spokesman said the move was an independent decision made by the justice department.

"Anti-tax protesters storm Kenya's parliament, drawing police fire as president vows to quash unrest",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/anti-tax-protesters-storm-kenyas-parliament-drawing-police-fire-as-president-vows-to-quash-unrest/articleshow/111270492.cms,"NAIROBI: Thousands of protesters stormed Kenya's parliament Tuesday to protest tax proposals , burning part of the building, sending lawmakers fleeing and drawing fire from police in unrest that the president vowed to quash. Several people were killed.It was the most direct assault on the government in decades. Journalists saw at least three bodies outside the complex where police had opened fire, and medical workers reported five people killed. Clashes spread to other cities. There was no immediate word on arrests.""Today's events mark a critical turning point on how we respond to threats to our national security,"" President William Ruto said, calling the events ""treasonous"" and vowing to quash the unrest ""at whatever cost.""Kenya's defense minister said the military had been deployed to support police during the ""security emergency"" and ""breaching of critical infrastructure.""Protesters had demanded that legislators vote against a finance bill imposing new taxes on East Africa's economic hub, where frustrations over the high cost of living have simmered. Youth who had voted Ruto into power with cheers for his promises of economic relief have taken to the streets to object to the pain of reforms.Lawmakers managed to pass the bill before fleeing through a tunnel as protesters outmaneuvered police and poured in. The fire at the building was later put out.The Kenya Medical Association said in a statement that at least five people were fatally shot while trying to treat wounded people at the scene. It said more than 30 people were wounded, at least 13 with live bullets. Police fired live ammunition and threw tear gas canisters at protesters who sought treatment at a medical tent at a nearby church. Elsewhere in town, Kenyatta National Hospital said it received 45 casualties.One person shot dead was wrapped in a Kenyan flag and carried away. Another lay on the sidewalk, their head in the gutter.Internet service in the country noticeably slowed in what NetBlocks called a ""major disruption,"" and at least one broadcaster issued a statement saying that ""we have received threats from the authorities to shut us down.""Ruto had been outside Nairobi attending an African Union retreat. He was expected to sign the finance bill into law this week. He has two weeks to act but faces calls from religious and other leaders to think again.The nearby office of the Nairobi governor, a member of the ruling party, also was briefly on fire Tuesday, smoke pouring from its white facade. Police water cannons were used to extinguish the fire.Protesters could be heard shouting, ""We're coming for every politician.""The Kenya Human Rights Commission shared a video of officers shooting at protesters, and it urged Ruto to issue an immediate order to ""stop the killings.""The president instead said the government had ""mobilized all resources"" to ensure order.On Sunday, Ruto tried to calm the rising public tensions, saying he was proud of the young Kenyans who came out to exercise their democratic duty in earlier protests. The politician who had promoted himself as a ""hustler"" from humble beginnings said he would engage them on their concerns.Youth had announced they were uniting to keep the government in check as prices for fuel, food and other necessities have soared. In Nairobi, a regional hub for expatriates and home to a United Nations complex, the inequality among Kenyans has sharpened along with long-held frustrations over state corruption.Opposition to the finance bill has united a large part of the country, with some explicitly rejecting the tribal divisions that have torn Kenya apart in the past. Some who had passionately supported Ruto felt betrayed.""I fell for his lies. Now I'm out here regretting why I voted for him,"" youth Oscar Saina told The Associated Press last weekAs throngs of protesters rushed through the streets Tuesday, defiance emerged elsewhere in the country - including in the town where the president was, Naivasha, as protesters chanted ""Ruto must go.""Protesters tried to storm the State House in the western city of Nakuru, a witness said. There were clashes in the western lakeside city of Kisumu. The governor of Mombasa, Kenya's second largest city, joined protesters outside his office and expressed his support for them.Protesters burned ruling party offices in Embu in central Kenya, the Nation newspaper reported. Citizen TV showed footage from Nyeri in central Kenya with police confronting protesters in the smoking streets.A national gathering of Catholic bishops urged police not to attack protesters and pleaded with the government to listen to citizens' pain over the ""unwarranted"" taxes, saying ""the country is bleeding ... families are immensely suffering.""Two people died in similar protests last week, and civil society groups have raised the alarm about a crackdown.The Kenya Law Society President Faith Odhiambo said earlier Tuesday that 50 Kenyans, including her personal assistant, had been ""abducted"" by people believed to be police officers. Some had been vocal in the demonstrations and were taken from homes, workplaces and public spaces ahead of Tuesday's protests, according to civil society groups.A statement by diplomats from 13 Western countries including the United States said they were ""shocked"" by the scenes outside parliament and expressed concern about the violence and abductions of protesters.Police officials did not immediately return calls seeking comment. Parliament Speaker Moses Wetangula had directed the inspector general of police to provide information on the whereabouts of those missing.Also Tuesday, hundreds of Kenya's police officers, long accused of abuses by human rights watchdogs and others, arrived in Haiti to lead a United Nations-backed multinational force against the powerful gangs who have the country in its grip. The deployment faces a legal challenge in Kenya but Ruto's government has gone ahead, with the thanks of US President Joe Biden.","President William Ruto calls the events ""treasonous"" and vows to quash the unrest ""at whatever cost"" The military is deployed to support police during the ""security emergency,"" the defense minister says.

It will commence with actions against terrorists. The operation has no political motive, its sole purpose is to counter the surge in terrorism,” the minister said.“We fought two wars under the Zia-ul-Haq and Musharraf regimes for US interests. This operation, however, is being conducted on our own terms, not at the behest of China or anyone else,” he said.The defence minister assured that there would be no evacuations during this operation.","PM Shehbaz Sharif had announced plans to launch a full-scale offensive, named “Azm-e-Istehkam (Resolve for Stability)”, to eliminate terrorism and extremism.

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been released from Belmarsh high-security prison in southeast London after five years in British custody. His wife, Stella Assange, expressed her gratitude to campaigners for their support, sharing the news on the social media platform X. ""Julian is free!!!!"" she wrote, adding, ""Words cannot express our immense gratitude"" to everyone who supported the global push for his release.Assange's release marks a significant turn in a prolonged legal battle that began with his detention for skipping bail related to Swedish sexual assault charges, which were later dropped. Assange, who was accused of disclosing US military secrets, had been fighting extradition to the United States.Assange's mother said his ""ordeal is finally coming to an end"", in a statement to Australian media following news of a plea deal for his release.""I am grateful that my son's ordeal is finally coming to an end. This shows the importance and power of quiet diplomacy,"" Christine Assange said in a statementHere is all you need to know Assange, his impriosnment and release:Assange was released after the UK High Court granted him bail. WikiLeaks announced, ""Julian Assange is free. He left Belmarsh maximum security prison on the morning of June 24, after having spent 1,901 days there."" This decision followed a successful appeal against his extradition to the US.Assange was granted bail by the UK High Court and left Belmarsh prison on the morning of June 24. He was released at Stansted airport in the afternoon, where he boarded a plane and departed the UK.WikiLeaks emphasized the impact of sustained global campaigns: ""This is the result of a global campaign that spanned grass-roots organisers, press freedom campaigners, legislators and leaders from across the political spectrum, all the way to the United Nations."" These efforts created the space for negotiations with the US Department of Justice, leading to a deal.While the deal has not been formally finalized, it allows Assange to plead guilty to a single count of conspiring to obtain and disclose classified US national defense documents. He is expected to be sentenced to 62 months of time already served.In 2010, WikiLeaks published a vast collection of classified US military documents related to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, marking the most significant security breaches in US military history. The release also included a substantial number of diplomatic cables.The indictment against Assange was brought forth during the administration of former President Donald Trump, stemming from WikiLeaks' extensive disclosure of confidential US documents. These documents were originally leaked by Chelsea Manning, a former U.S. military intelligence analyst who faced prosecution under the Espionage Act.The released documents, numbering over 700,000, encompassed diplomatic cables and battlefield accounts. Among them was a 2007 video depicting a U.S. Apache helicopter opening fire on suspected insurgents in Iraq, resulting in the deaths of twelve individuals, including two Reuters news staff. The video was made public in 2010.Assange is due to plead guilty to violating US espionage law, specifically conspiring to obtain and disseminate classified national defense information. The charges stem from WikiLeaks' 2010 release of classified US military documents related to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.Assange spent 1,901 days in Belmarsh prison. He married his wife Stella while in custody and will now be reunited with her and their two children. Stella Assange thanked supporters, saying, ""Julian paid severely for these principles, and for the people's right to know.""Assange will appear in US federal court in the Northern Mariana Islands to plead guilty. Following his plea and sentencing, he is expected to return to Australia.WikiLeaks has expressed immense gratitude for the support from various quarters, including grassroots organizers, press freedom advocates, and political leaders. The Australian government, which has been advocating for Assange's release, had no immediate comment. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has previously stated, ""Mr. Assange’s case has dragged on for too long and there is nothing to be gained by his continued incarceration.""Assange's family and supporters have noted that his physical and mental health have suffered during his legal battles and years in confinement.

Sheri Biggs wins republican nod for US house in South Carolina over Trump-backed candidate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/sheri-biggs-wins-republican-nod-for-us-house-in-south-carolina-over-trump-backed-candidate/articleshow/111272014.cms,"COLUMBIA: Sheri Biggs , a nurse practitioner and air national guard officer, won the republican nomination for the US house in South Carolina 's 3rd district on Tuesday, defeating a challenger who called himself former president Donald Trump 's pastor.In November, Biggs will be a heavy favorite in the most republican district in GOP-dominated South Carolina. She was backed by republican gov Henry McMaster, who she and her husband have been longtime friends and financial backers.Biggs defeated Mark Burns, a black pastor who has been by Trump's side for nearly a decade and has unsuccessfully run for Congress twice before.This was Biggs' first run for political office and if she wins in November, she will be only the second republican woman South Carolina has sent to Congress. US rep Nancy Mace is still serving for the 1st district.The seat is open after republican rep Jeff Duncan decided not to run again after seven terms. Duncan's wife of 35 years filed for divorce in 2023, accusing him of several affairs.Biggs will face the democratic nominee, Sherwin-Williams paint store manager Byron Best from Greenwood, and Michael Bedenbaugh, of the Alliance Party, in November.The district in the northwest corner of the state contains several small population centers.While longtime friends Trump and McMaster were on opposite sides, there was no apparent animosity between the endorsers. McMaster did campaign in person for Biggs, while Trump didn't make a visit to South Carolina for Burns.McMaster and Trump go back a long way. McMaster was the nation's first statewide elected official to back Trump in early 2016. Trump said when he became president he asked then-South Carolina governer Nikki Haley to become UN ambassador so McMaster could move from lieutenant governor to the state's top job.Biggs and Burns had similar, popular views for republicans, like ending nearly all abortions, closing the border and fighting inflation, as well as a total disdain for ideas from democrats.Burns won the June 11 primary with 33% of the vote, but Biggs was just a few points behind.With similar agendas, the two-week sprint to the runoff was more about style. Burns called Biggs a ""swamp creature"" who wouldn't fight the establishmentBiggs, who is a lieutenant colonel in the air national guard, said Burns misconstrued his academic and military background and voted for former democratic president Barack Obama . Biggs has promoted pictures of her taken with Trump and said she is the candidate who can bring people together.She said Tuesday evening that she will help heal the nation's mental, fiscal, and spiritual problems and promised to defend conservative values.""I stand here ready to not only win this seat in November but also to help President Trump win back the White House ,"" Biggs said in a statement on social media.Both candidates have invested heavily from their own money. Biggs loaned her campaign nearly $350,000 while raising an additional $182,000 from individual donors.Burns has taken out $500,000 in loans for the 2024 campaign and raised a little over $16,000 from individuals. He still owes a $100,000 loan from an unsuccessful 2022 run in the neighboring 4th district. And unlike Biggs, Burns has not filed a required ethics disclosure form detailing his personal finances, which would give a glimpse into his personal worth and ability to pay the loans back.In Lexington County, just west of Columbia, voters rejected the last of the three republican ""Sister Senators,"" who helped defeat a near-total abortion ban in South Carolina.Attorney Carlisle Kennedy defeated state sen Katrina Shealy in a runoff, ending her 12-year career in the senate. Kennedy has no opposition in the November general election.Kennedy finished second in the June 11 primary with 36% of the vote to Shealy's 40%, but was able to consolidate votes from those who didn't want to return Shealy to the statehouse.Shealy, along with fellow republican sens Sandy Senn and Penry Gustafson, were given the John F Kennedy profile in courage award for people who risk their careers for the greater good after they joined with democratic lawmakers last year over the abortion measure. The general assembly eventually passed a measure that would ban most abortions after around six weeks of pregnancy before most people know they are pregnant.The Sister Senators said a pregnant woman shouldn't lose control of her body as soon as an egg is fertilized.Senn lost her primary by 33 votes, while Gustafson got only 18% of the vote. They both were in Lexington County campaigning Tuesday for Shealy.Outside of a democratic senator mostly drawn out of his district due to redistricting, the women are the only ones in the 46-seat South Carolina senate to lose their reelection bids.Shealy told reporters Tuesday night she doesn't think her political career is over. She said she plans to spend the next four years going after the chief backers of the total abortion ban in the state house and senate who she thinks unfairly attacked her.""I'm going after them with all I've got,"" Shealy said.","Sheri Biggs, a nurse practitioner and air national guard officer, won the republican nomination for the US house in South Carolina's 3rd district on Tuesday.

US rep Lauren Boebert wins republican house primary after switching districts in Colorado,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-rep-lauren-boebert-wins-republican-house-primary-after-switching-districts-in-colorado/articleshow/111271480.cms,"DENVER: US rep Lauren Boebert won the republican primary in a US house race that she jumped into last year, surviving a scandal over a video of her at a Denver theater and accusations of carpetbagging after fleeing what could have been a tough reelection bid in her current district.Boebert built national hard-line conservative stardom through a take-no-prisoners political style in the House. That clout likely made it easier for her to weather the scandals of the last year, which included the video of her vaping and causing a disturbance at a musical production of ""Beetlejuice.""Boebert beat a group of homegrown primary candidates who had far less name recognition and generally less combative political styles.She is expected to win the November general election in the 4th district, which is a dark shade of red and tilted heavily toward former president Donald Trump in the 2020 election.Boebert said she made the switch to ensure another republican could win her old district, which she nearly lost in 2022, and she blamed outside groups for targeting her. But she had already become a fundraising magnet for the district's likely democratic candidate, who has pulled in millions that may help him flip a seat that has leaned Republican in recent years.Boebert entered her election night party in the evening toting a pair of reflective gold sneakers sold by former president Donald Trump and a white ""Make America Great Again"" hat with Trump's signature etched across the bill.Her opponents in the primary were more traditional rivals including former state sen Jerry Sonnenberg; current state reps Mike Lynch and Richard Holtorf; and parental rights advocate Deborah Flora.While the theater incident and Boebert's district jump rattled some republicans, Gilbert Kendzior, 68, a voter in Boebert's new district, shrugged them off, asking ""who's perfect?""Kendzior said he voted for the congresswoman because she shakes things up. ""It's gotten too staid. Same promises, nothing happens,"" he said. ""We need to get rid of the old farts.""Boebert is expected to also win the November general election in the 4th congressional district, which sweeps across a wide expanse of ranches, ghost towns and conservative parts of the Denver metro area that make up much of the plains of eastern Colorado. Its voters overwhelmingly backed Trump in the 2020 election.The seat opened up after former republican rep Ken Buck resigned from Congress. A special election was also being held Tuesday to fill the remaining months of Buck's term, with republican Greg Lopez, a former mayor of the city of Parker, favored to beat a democrat and third-party candidates.Buck cited the divisiveness of today's politics and his party's devotion to Trump in explaining his decision to resign. That division remains a factor in the race and is also on display in another republican house primary in Colorado Springs, about an hour's drive south of Denver.In the 5th congressional district, republican Dave Williams faced condemnation from his own ranks and demands for his resignation as GOP party chair, accused of using his position and state party resources to boost his own campaign.The final straw for some Republicans was a recent email calling people celebrating Gay Pride Month ""godless groomers."" The state party's account on the social platform X also posted: ""Burn all the #pride flags this June.""Williams' opponent in the primary was Jeff Crank, a conservative commentator who has a similar political platform but breaks in style and disposition. Both are vying to fill the seat of republican rep Doug Lamborn, who is not seeking reelection.Williams is a hard-line Trump acolyte who has parroted the former president's lies about the 2020 election and attacked fellow Republicans who don't align. Crank is molded in an older, more pragmatic GOP tradition.As in the 4th district, the winner of the republican-friendly 5th district will be favored in the general election.Another house race watched closely on the national level was the 8th district, newly minted after redistricting in 2021 and hotly contested with voters roughly split between the two major parties.The district, which stretches north of Denver, is currently represented by democrat Yadira Caraveo, who won by less than 2,000 votes in 2022. Republican state rep Gabe Evans and former state rep Janak Joshi, a retired physician, were vying to challenge Caraveo, with Evans a former police officer, considered the front-runner.The primary winner will likely benefit from a windfall of support from the national republican campaign committee, which is intent on defending the party's thin house majority.Farther to the west, among the rocky mountains and high desert mesas, a half-dozen republicans were looking to replace Boebert as the nominee in the 3rd district.The contenders include attorney Jeff Hurd and former republican state rep Ron Hanks, whose differences largely follow the contours of Cranks' and Williams', respectively. Other candidates include Stephen Varela, a former democrat who switched parties, businessman Lew Webb and financial advisor Russ Andrews.The winner will be up against Adam Frisch, the businessman and democratic candidate who lost to Boebert by only 546 votes in 2022, garnering name recognition from that close race in the conservative district. Frisch raised at least $13 million for his 2024 campaign.","Boebert beat a group of homegrown primary candidates who had far less name recognition and generally less combative political styles. She is expected to win the November general election in the 4th district, which is a dark shade of red and tilted heavily toward former president Donald Trump in the 2020 election.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111271614,imgsize-1029636,width-400,resizemode-4/111271614.jpg"

US surgeon general declares gun violence a public health emergency,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-surgeon-general-declares-gun-violence-a-public-health-emergency/articleshow/111271005.cms,"WASHINGTON: The US surgeon general on Tuesday declared gun violence a public health crisis, driven by the fast-growing number of injuries and deaths involving firearms in the country.The advisory issued by Dr. Vivek Murthy , the nation's top doctor, came as the US grappled with another summer weekend marked by mass shootings that left dozens of people dead or wounded.""People want to be able to walk through their neighborhoods and be safe,"" Murthy told The Associated Press in a phone interview. ""America should be a place where all of us can go to school, go to work, go to the supermarket, go to our house of worship, without having to worry that that's going to put our life at risk.""To drive down gun deaths, Murthy calls on the US to ban automatic rifles, introduce universal background checks for purchasing guns, regulate the industry, pass laws that would restrict their use in public spaces and penalize people who fail to safely store their weapons.None of those suggestions can be implemented nationwide without legislation passed by Congress, which typically recoils at gun control measures. Some state legislatures, however, have enacted or may consider some of the surgeon general's proposals.Surgeon General Murthy said there is ""broad agreement"" that gun violence is a problem, citing a poll last year that found most Americans worry at least sometimes that a loved one might be injured by a firearm. More than 48,000 Americans died from gun injuries in 2022.Doctors quickly praised Murthy's advisory. The American Academy of Family Physicians, for example, has considered gun violence a public health epidemic for over a decade.""Family physicians have long understood, and have seen first hand, the devastating impact firearm violence has on our patients and the communities we serve,"" the group's president, Steven Furr, said in a statement.Murthy's advisory, however, promises to be controversial with the gun lobby and will certainly incense Republican lawmakers, most of whom opposed his confirmation - twice - to the job over his statements on gun violence.The National Rifle Association promptly rebuked Murthy's advisory.""This is an extension of the Biden Administration's war on law-abiding gun owners,"" Randy Kozuch, the organization's president, said in a statement on X.It was the NRA, and Republicans who enjoy the powerful gun lobby's support, that almost derailed Murthy's confirmation as surgeon general a decade ago. Murthy became quieter on the issue of gun violence after his past statements almost cost him the job. He ended up promising the Senate that he did ""not intend to use my office as surgeon general as a bully pulpit on gun control.""Then-President Donald Trump dismissed Murthy in 2017, but President Joe Biden nominated him again to the position in 2021.Murthy has published warnings about troubling health trends in American life, including loneliness and social media use. In an opinion piece in The New York Times this month, he said social media has contributed to a mental health crisis among the country's young people and asked Congress to require warning labels on social media platforms similar to those on cigarette boxes.But he also has faced mounting pressure from some doctors and Democratic advocacy groups to speak out more. A group of four former surgeon generals asked the Biden administration to produce a report on the problem in 2022.""It is now time for us to take this issue out of the realm of politics and put it in the realm of public health, the way we did with smoking more than a half century ago,"" Murthy told the AP.It was a 1964 report from the surgeon general that raised awareness about the dangers of smoking is largely credited with reducing tobacco use and precipitating regulations on the industry.Murthy now hopes his advisory on guns will shift the conversation, too, on this issue. He has been encouraged by some developments in Congress, including the passage of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act in 2022 that enhanced background checks for firearms.A White House report obtained by The Associated Press says that more thorough background checks have stopped roughly 800 sales of firearms to people under age 21. Additionally, more than 500 people, including some linked to transnational cartels and organized crime rings, have been charged with gun trafficking and other crimes under the landmark gun safety legislation.Children and younger Americans, in particular, are suffering from gun violence, Murthy notes in his advisory called ""Firearm Violence: A Public Health Crisis in America."" Suicide by gun rates have increased by nearly 70% for those between the ages of 10 to 14. Children in the US are far more likely to die from gun wounds than children in other countries, the research he gathered shows.For pediatricians, talking with families about locking up their guns away from their children has become a routine part of well visits, said Benjamin Hoffman, the president of the American Academy of Pediatrics. When children can't get access to a gun, it prevents a large chunk of gun deaths and injuries - accidental shootings and suicides.""Having access to a firearm for a child who is experiencing a behavioral health crisis is an absolute recipe for the most tragic things you can imagine,"" Hoffman said.Even when children are not direct victims of a gun shooting, they may suffer from mental health blowback of gun violence, the report says. About half of teens in the US worry about a school shooting. And in areas that have been exposed to a fatal shooting at a school, youth antidepressant use jumps by more than 20%.In addition to new regulations, Murthy calls for an increase in gun violence research and for the health system to promote and educate patients about gun safety and proper storage during checkups.","Surgeon General Vivek Murthy declares gun violence a public health crisis.

Inside the car were his wife and two children, aged 4 and 7 at that time. All four of them survived.His wife previously argued for his release and said that she and their children need him in their lives.

Azm-e-Istehkam: Pakistan's new military operation to take on TTP and other militant groups,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/what-is-azm-e-istehkam-pakistans-new-military-operation-against-militants/articleshow/111255323.cms,"China has pressured Pakistan to crack down on the armed violence against CPEC targets.

What they're saying

“A soft state can never gain the trust of investors,” PM Shehbaz remarked. “The responsibility of the fight against terrorism is the collective duty and the primary obligation of all state institutions. It’s not about you and me, it’s about us, we have to trample it together.”

""The campaign will be complemented by socioeconomic measures aimed at addressing genuine concerns of the people and creating an environment that discourages extremist tendencies,"" said a statement from Sharif's office.

Ihsanullah Tipu, a security analyst, noted, ""Pakistan views the use of active military force as the most effective approach to counter armed violence.""

Some analysts suggest that the operation's timing may also be influenced by domestic political and economic considerations. Asfandyar Mir of the US Institute of Peace said, ""With the election done and a government in place, and the economic situation stabilizing, Pakistani leadership probably feels confident to pursue a vigorous campaign.""

What is the main objective of

Operation Azm-e-Istehkam

?

The primary objective of Operation Azm-e-Istehkam is to curb the surge in violence and armed attacks within Pakistan. This includes addressing domestic security threats and dealing with armed fighters crossing over from Afghanistan. The operation also aims to implement socioeconomic measures to create an environment that discourages extremist tendencies.

Why now?

The timing of the operation is linked to a dramatic increase in violent incidents over the last 18 months. Most of these attacks have been claimed by the TTP , which ended a ceasefire in November 2022.

, which ended a ceasefire in November 2022. Additionally, recent attacks targeting Chinese interests in Pakistan have further underscored the urgency of a robust military response.

Pakistan has seen nearly 1,000 casualties from almost 700 incidents of violence in 2023. Attacks targeting Chinese installations and personnel have increased, highlighting the stakes for Pakistan's key ally, China, which has invested $62 billion in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ).

). Senior Chinese officials have also emphasized the need for improved security for Chinese nationals and investments in Pakistan.

How will the operation be different from previous military campaigns?

Unlike previous large-scale military operations that required mass displacement of local populations, Azm-e-Istehkam is not intended to be a kinetic large-scale military campaign. The focus will be on augmenting the efforts of armed forces with intelligence-based operations and legal measures to address terrorism-related cases. The operation is described as a “multi-domain, multi-agency, whole of the system national vision” for enduring stability.

What are the potential challenges to the success of this operation?

Security analysts highlight several challenges, including the transient nature of TTP bases in Pakistan and the risk of escalating tensions with Afghanistan if cross-border operations are conducted. Additionally, the lack of public support for security forces in provinces heavily affected by violence could hinder the operation’s effectiveness. There is also the issue of diverging approaches between Pakistan and China regarding the Taliban in Afghanistan, a report in AlJazeera said.

What has been the reaction of opposition parties to this operation?

Opposition parties, including the PTI, JUI-F, and ANP, have expressed significant criticism of the operation. They argue that it could worsen the volatile situation in border regions and have questioned the government's decision-making process, claiming it lacked sufficient consultation with parliament and local stakeholders.

How has China reacted to recent attacks targeting its nationals and investments in Pakistan?

China has expressed strong concerns over the security of its nationals and investments in Pakistan, urging the Pakistani government to take effective measures to protect them. Following attacks on Chinese engineers and installations, Chinese officials have reiterated the importance of security and the need to protect Chinese interests in the country.

Will the operation affect Pakistan’s relationship with Afghanistan?

The operation could strain already tense relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan, particularly if cross-border military actions are taken. The Taliban government in Kabul has consistently denied harboring TTP militants, and any escalation of military activities could complicate diplomatic relations further.

Since 2001, Pakistan's military has conducted many high-profile operations like ""Zarb-e-Azb"", ""Rah-e-Nijat"", ""Rah-e-Rast"" and many more against homegrown militants in border areas. It seems it's time for another military operation against militants in Pakistan. But the Pakistan military has failed to root out these militant groups time and again.However, under pressure from China, the Pakistan government has again approved a new military campaign named Azm-e-Istehkam, meaning ""Resolve for Stability."" This initiative, announced by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif after a review of the country's counterterrorism efforts, aims to address domestic security threats and the activities of armed fighters crossing over from Afghanistan.
