The Iran-backed Hezbollah on Saturday confirmed the death of its leader Hassan Nasrallah in Israeli airstrikes on Friday. Recently, Israel eliminated several functionaries of the militant group and now it faces concern of who will succeed Nasrallah.According to several reports, Hashem Safieddine is considered a potential heir to Nasrallah. News agency Reuters citing a source within Hezbollah said that Safieddine survived the Israeli strikes.Hashem Safieddine is a cousin of the late leader Nasrallah and as the head of the executive council oversees Hezbollah’s political affairs.He is also a cleric who wears the black turban that signifies descent from Islam's Prophet Mohammed. He also serves on the group's Jihad Council .Safieddine's family ties and religious status as a descendant of Mohammed would all work in his favor as a potential successor, reported news agency Reuters.In 2017, the US State Department designated him as a terrorist, and in June, he threatened major escalation against Israel following the death of another Hezbollah commander. At the funeral, he warned, ""Let (the enemy) prepare himself to cry and wail.""Safieddine's public statements often reflect Hezbollah's militant stance and its alignment with the Palestinian cause. At a recent event in Dahiyeh, Hezbollah's stronghold in Beirut's southern suburbs, he declared, ""Our history, our guns and our rockets are with you,"" in a show of solidarity with Palestinian fighters.According to Philip Smyth, an expert on Iran-backed Shi-ite militias, said Nasrallah ""started tailoring positions for him within a variety of different councils within Lebanese Hezbollah. Some of them were more opaque than others. They've had him come, go out and speak,""He has also been outspoken in his criticism of US policy. In 2017, responding to American pressure on Hezbollah, he said, ""This mentally impeded, crazy US administration headed by Trump will not be able to harm the resistance,"" maintaining that such actions would only bolster Hezbollah's determination.Hassan Nasrallah joined the list of some of the important leaders and commanders Israel recently assassinated amid the conflicts that started on October 07, 2023, following a brutal attack by Hamas on Israel killing over a thousand people. Here are some of the other functionaries that were killed in recent months.The Hamas chief was assassinated in the early hours of July 31 in Iran. He was killed in a state guest house where he was staying while he was in the Iranian capital to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian.Earlier, on April 10, an Israeli air strike targeted the car carrying three of Haniyeh's sons - Hazem, Amir, and Mohammad - resulting in their deaths, along with four of Haniyeh's grandchildren, including three girls and a boy, according to Hamas.Hezbollah commander Qubaisi was killed in an airstrike on the southern suburbs of Beirut on September 24 killed Qubaisi.Hezbollah's operations commander was killed by an Israeli strike in Beirut's southern suburbs on September 20.

Nasrallah and his support for Palestinian cause



Hezbollah leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah was killed by the Israeli forces in an airstrike , the Israel Defense Forces said on Saturday, hours after strikes on Hezbollah headquarters.""Hassan Nasrallah will no longer be able to terrorize the world,” the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) declared following an airstrike in Beirut ’s southern suburbs.IDF spokesperson Nadav Shoshani confirmed Nasrallah’s death on X, stating, ""Hassan Nasrallah is dead.""Earlier reports indicated that Nasrallah had been the target of Israeli strikes carried out on Friday, which also targeted Hezbollah’s underground headquarters in the area.The Israeli military stated that a strike targeting Hezbollah's headquarters in Beirut resulted in numerous deaths and injuries.Israeli airstrikes destroyed six buildings in the southern suburb of Harek Hreik in Beirut on Friday, marking the most significant strike in the Lebanese capital during nearly a year of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah headed Hezbollah for over three decades, making it one of the most powerful militant groups in the middle east.Born in 1960 into a struggling Shiite family, he pursued theological studies and became involved with the Amal movement, a Shiite political and paramilitary organization, before emerging as one of the founders of Hezbollah.In 1985, Hezbollah formally declared its formation by releasing an ""open letter"" that named the US and the Soviet Union as Islam's main enemies. The letter also called for the ""obliteration"" of Israel, which it accused of occupying Muslim territories, BBC reported.The US designated Hezbollah a terrorist organisation in 1997, five years after Nasrallah was chosen as its secretary-general.Hezbollah was established by members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard who arrived in Lebanon during the summer of 1982 to combat the invading Israeli forces.Under Nasrallah's leadership, Hezbollah played a pivotal role in the war of attrition that resulted in the withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon in 2000, ending an 18-year occupation.In 2006, Hezbollah engaged Israel in a 34-day conflict that ended in a stalemate, which he declared as ""divine victory.""A day after the Israel-Hamas war erupted on October 7, Hezbollah launched attacks on Israeli military posts along the border, labeling it a “backup front” for Gaza.""We are here paying the price for our front of support for Gaza, and for the Palestinian people, and our adoption of the Palestinian cause,"" Nasrallah said in a speech on August 1.Throughout the conflict, Hezbollah's leader has claimed that the group's cross-border strikes have diverted Israeli forces that would otherwise focus on Hamas in Gaza. He said that Hezbollah would not cease its attacks until a cease-fire is achieved in the region.As tensions escalated in recent weeks, Israel announced a new phase in the conflict aimed at pushing Hezbollah back from the border, allowing thousands displaced from northern Israel to return home.This escalation included strikes that resulted in the deaths of top Hezbollah military commanders and were linked to the destruction of numerous communications devices, including pagers used by the group, leading to 37 fatalities and thousands of injuries.","Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah was killed by the Israeli forces in an airstrike, the Israel Defense Forces said on Saturday.

Huge stocks of baby oil, drugs were found at Diddy's sex den while Diddy did not plead guilty to the charges.Usher who once stayed with Diddy said his X account got hacked and that's why all his past posts disappeared.

Who was Nasrallah?

Rising tensions in the region

The confirmed death of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli airstrike marks a crucial turning point for the Iran-backed Lebanese militant group he led for 32 years. Analysts believe Nasrallah’s assassination will severely impact Hezbollah, intensifying the challenge of identifying a suitable successor to continue his leadership.Israel's chief of staff Herzi Halevi said that the operation targeting Nasrallah was a result of extensive planning, signaling that further military actions against Hezbollah are likely.Identifying a successor to Nasrallah presents a complex challenge as the new leader must garner support not only from within Hezbollah's ranks in Lebanon which is under Israel’s heavy attack but also from the group’s powerful backers in Iran.According to reports from the Times of Israel, Hashem Safieddine is being viewed as a potential heir to Nasrallah. A cousin of the late leader, Safieddine is currently overseeing Hezbollah’s political affairs and serves on the group's Jihad Council.However, Safieddine was designated a terrorist by the US State Department in 2017 and has previously threatened retaliation against Israel following the deaths of other key Hezbollah figures.Hassan Nasrallah, who became secretary-general of Hezbollah in 1992, transformed the group into one of the most powerful militant organizations in the Middle East. His tenure was marked by a staunch anti-Israel stance and a commitment to resisting perceived Western imperialism. Nasrallah’s leadership not only solidified Hezbollah’s military capabilities but also its political influence in Lebanon.Born in 1960 into a modest Shiite family, Nasrallah’s rise began with his involvement in the Amal movement before helping to found Hezbollah in the early 1980s. Under his guidance, Hezbollah declared its formation with a manifesto that called for the ""obliteration"" of Israel, positioning the group as a key player in the ongoing Arab-Israeli conflict.In the wake of Nasrallah’s death, the Israeli military has mobilised additional reserve soldiers, activating several battalions amid fears of increased conflict with Lebanon. Recent Israeli strikes in southern Beirut and the Bekaa Valley have led to Hezbollah retaliating with projectiles aimed at northern and central Israel.At least 720 people have been killed in Lebanon according to the health ministry since significant escalation in the conflict.","Hassan Nasrallah's death marks a crucial turning point for the Iran-backed Lebanese militant group he led for 32 years.

Asheville 's historic Biltmore Village , situated in western North Carolina , is now submerged due to severe flooding after Hurricane Helene hit the state. The village, known for its arts scene and unique ownership, is located where the Swannanoa River joins the French Broad River.In Asheville, home to approximately 94,000 residents, floodwaters have risen several feet, covering street signs and inundating buildings and small businesses after heavy rain, strong winds, and mudslides.Asheville also faced widespread cellular service outages, with no estimated time for restoration.A curfew was imposed by Asheville police from 7:30 pm Friday to 7:30 am Saturday for public safety, effective until further notice. Transit services in the village were suspended, and residents were advised to boil water due to a major water line break and possible water shortages or low pressure.Historically, Biltmore Village was designed to look like a small English village and had the region’s first railroad station. It served as an entrance to George Vanderbilt’s Biltmore Estate and aimed to be a self-sustaining community. From its inception, it was called a “model village” and “A Millionaire’s Village.”An eyewitness told NBC News, ""We knew the flooding was coming, but we didn’t know it was going to be this catastrophic.""The North Carolina Department of Transportation said that most routes into Asheville and throughout the mountains were affected. According to the Department of Transportation, over 400 roads have been closed, hindering travel and rescue efforts, which are ongoing. The state transportation department also warned on social media, ""All roads in Western North Carolina should be considered closed.""Many gas stations in North Carolina closed early Saturday due to power outages, while those that remained open saw long lines. Over 700,000 power customers across North Carolina lost electricity, including 160,000 in Buncombe County. Major highways, including Interstates 40 and 26, were blocked at multiple locations.Governor Roy Cooper ’s office confirmed that more than 200 people have been rescued from floodwaters across North Carolina.President Joe Biden has approved emergency declarations for several states, including Georgia, Florida, Alabama, North Carolina, Tennessee, and South Carolina. Biden has deployed over 1,500 federal personnel to assist with search and rescue, medical needs, and power restoration in the affected areas.The storm reached Georgia on Thursday night, causing widespread damage throughout the southern US. Over 64 fatalities have been reported as a result of Hurricane Helene, according to an AP report.","Asheville's historic Biltmore Village is now submerged due to severe flooding after Hurricane Helene hit the state.

Tightened security

BEIRUT: Armed men fired shots in the air and shut down shops in parts of Beirut and Hezbollah supporters said they were in a state of shock and disbelief on Saturday after the death of the Lebanese armed group's leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah .Hezbollah confirmed on Saturday Nasrallah had been killed, issuing a statement hours after the Israeli military said it had eliminated him in an airstrike on the group's headquarters in Beirut's southern suburbs on Friday.Nasrallah's death marked a devastating blow to Hezbollah as it reels from an intense campaign of Israeli attacks, and even as the news emerged some of the group's supporters were desperately hoping that somehow he was still alive.""God, I hope it's not true. It's a disaster if it's true,"" said Zahraa, a young woman who had been displaced overnight from Hezbollah's stronghold in the southern suburbs of Beirut.""He was leading us. He was everything to us. We were under his wings,"" she told Reuters tearfully by phone.She said other displaced people around her fainted or began to scream when they received notifications on their phone of Hezbollah's statement confirming his death.Nasrallah, who led Hezbollah since the Shi'ite Muslim group's previous leader was killed in an Israeli operation in 1992, was known for his televised addresses - watched carefully by both the group's backers and its opponents.""We're still waiting for him to come out on the television at 5 p.m. and tell us that everything is okay, that we can go back home,"" Zahraa said.In some parts of Beirut, armed men came into shops and told owners to shut them down, witnesses said. It was not immediately clear what faction the armed men belonged to.Sprays of gunshots were heard in the Hamra district in the city's west as mourners fired in the air, residents there said. Crowds were heard chanting, ""For you, Nasrallah!""Such firing often accompanies processions of either mourning or celebration in the Middle East - in this case, the former.Similar processions made their way through Beirut's southern suburbs, according to Hezbollah's Al-Manar TV.Other parts of the city were eerily quiet, with restaurants normally full on a sunny Saturday sitting abandoned.Lebanon 's army tightened security measures across the capital, a security source told Reuters, after having protectively deployed around the U.S. embassy north of Beirut.Army tanks deployed in the city centre, known as Martyrs' Square, according to a Reuters live broadcast.Dozens of people had spent the night there in the open after fleeing from the strikes on Beirut's southern suburbs.""This is unbelievable. We got the news and our nerves are frayed,"" said a man who gave his name as Waleed. ""There is nothing left now.""Another Lebanese man, Camelio Abdullah, said, ""if God forbid he's been assassinated, then the core of the resistance in the Middle East is destroyed"".A second security source said Lebanon's security forces were preparing for a possible outbreak in sectarian tensions.Lebanon is made up of a precarious balance of religious sects, including various Muslim and Christian communities, represented by rival political parties.

Donald Trump: Donald Trump attacks Kamala Harris over immigration and US border policy at Wisconsin rally,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-attacks-kamala-harris-over-immigration-and-us-border-policy-at-wisconsin-rally/articleshow/113777924.cms,"File photo: Former US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)

Former US President Donald Trump attacked Vice President Kamala Harris during his speech in Wisconsin on Saturday, targeting her immigration issues and her role in border policy , reported CBS News .Speaking in Prairie du Chien, Trump accused Harris of allowing illegal border crossings and blamed her for crimes committed by migrants, claiming she had effectively “erased” the US border.Trump also promised to ""liberate Wisconsin from the mass migrant invasion "" and extend that to the entire country if re-elected. He also escalated personal attacks on Harris, calling her “mentally impaired” and a “disaster,” stating, ""Joe Biden became mentally impaired. Kamala was born that way.""""Kamala was born that way. She was born that way. And if you think about it, only a mentally disabled person could have allowed this to happen to our country. Anybody would know this."", he said.Trump's criticism of Harris has been ongoing since she entered the race. Earlier this year, he controversially questioned her racial identity, falsely claiming she ""turned Black"" for political gain.""I didn't know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black and now she wants to be known as Black,"" Trump said at the time. ""So I don't know, is she Indian, or is she Black?"", Trump had asked.When asked if such personal attacks could hurt his standing with voters, Trump confidently responded that he didn’t believe so.In addition to criticising Harris, Trump reiterated his hardline stance on immigration, vowing to carry out the largest deportation operation in US history if elected. He claimed that Americans trust him more than Harris to handle border issues, and polls reflect his advantage on this topic in key swing states like Wisconsin.However, Trump's rally saw him jumping rapidly between various topics, from alleged assassination attempts to climate change and even comparing his physique to President Biden’s.He also mocked Harris’ event in Arizona the previous day, where she outlined new plans to tighten asylum rules. Harris had criticised Trump's border policies, accusing him of preferring to campaign on problems rather than fix them.Trump denied responsibility for separating children from their parents at the border during his presidency, despite this policy being implemented under his administration. In response, Harris addressed her supporters in San Francisco, describing Trump as ""a very unserious man"" with outdated rhetoric, but warning that his return to the White House would have severe consequences for the nation.The Harris campaign challenged Trump to another debate in a football-themed advert aired during the Alabama-Georgia game, which Trump attended after his rally. The ad teased Trump, calling him a “loser” for avoiding a second debate.","Former US President Donald Trump attacked Vice President Kamala Harris during his speech in Wisconsin on Saturday.

TOKYO: Thousands of Japanese fans bid tearful farewell to their beloved panda couple that made their final public appearance at Tokyo's Ueno Zoo on Saturday before returning to China for medical treatment.The pair, Ri Ri and Shin Shin, are the parents of Xiang Xiang , the park-born idol that had returned home last year.More than 2,000 visitors, many wearing T-shirts and carrying items decorated by panda motifs, queued outside the zoo hours before the opening.Some said they camped out overnight to secure their chance.The pandas, both 19 years old, arrived at the Ueno Zoo in 2011. Although their lease is good through 2026, Japan and China agreed to their return home as the aging couple need treatment for high blood pressure, according to the zoo.Hirono Sasaki, who waited to enter the zoo since 5 a.m., was crying. ""They were always my source of comfort, so I'm feel extremely sad,"" she said. ""I loved seeing Ri Ri climbing trees in her old enclosure. I hope she can climb trees again when she is back in China.""After their hours long wait, visitors were given only a few minutes inside their hut to view the black-and-white animals. Lucky ones could get a glimpse of them nibbling on bamboo branches, but others could only catch them during their naps.China sends pandas abroad as a sign of goodwill but maintains ownership over the animals and any cubs they produce. The animals are native to southwestern China and are an unofficial national mascot.Pandas, which reproduce rarely in the wild and rely on a diet of bamboo, remain among the world's most threatened species. An estimated 1,800 pandas live in the wild, while another 500 are in zoos or reserves, mostly in Sichuan.","Ri Ri and Shin Shin are the parents of Xiang Xiang, the park-born idol that had returned home last year.

While the two countries have an extradition treaty, the one signed in 2016 leaves room for the ""requestee country"" to turn down requests which are not made in ""good faith.""During the meeting, Khan apprised Yunus of the latest developments on the probe into the Rohingya deportation launched by ICC in 2019.

In a statement following the death of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli airstrike, US President Joe Biden , in a statement, called it ""a measure of justice"" on Saturday.""Hassan Nasrallah and the terrorist group he led, Hezbollah, were responsible for killing hundreds of Americans over a four-decade reign of terror. His death from an Israeli airstrike is a measure of justice for his many victims, including thousands of Americans, Israelis, and Lebanese civilians,"" said Biden.Nasrallah’s death comes amid an intensifying conflict that erupted after Hamas ’s deadly October 7, 2023, assault on Israel , which claimed the lives of over a thousand people.The day following that attack, Nasrallah announced Hezbollah’s decision to join the conflict, opening a ""northern front"" against Israel.Biden reaffirmed the US's unwavering support for Israel’s right to defend itself against groups such as Hezbollah, Hamas, and other Iranian-backed militant organizations. ""The United States fully supports Israel’s right to defend itself against Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, and any other Iranian-supported terrorist groups,"" he said.The president also revealed that he had ordered US military forces in the region to enhance their defense posture in an effort to deter further aggression and prevent a broader war.Despite the heightened tensions, Biden stressed that the ultimate goal remains de-escalation through diplomatic efforts. He said that the US is working with the United Nations Security Council to broker a deal ""for a ceasefire and the release of hostages"" in Gaza. ""In Lebanon, we have been negotiating a deal that would return people safely to their homes in Israel and southern Lebanon. It is time for these deals to close, for the threats to Israel to be removed, and for the broader Middle East region to gain greater stability,"" Biden added.The US State Department had earlier cautioned American citizens and the families of embassy personnel in Beirut to leave the country while authorising the departure of some staff to leave Lebanon and restated its advisory against any travel to the nation.In a statement released on Saturday, the department said, ""Due to the increased volatility following airstrikes within Beirut and the volatile and unpredictable security situation throughout Lebanon, the US Embassy urges US citizens to depart Lebanon while commercial options still remain available.""Meanwhile, US vice president Kamala Harris, who was attending two campaign fundraisers in California, released a separate statement that aligned with Biden's stance on Nasrallah's death. In her statement, she emphasised her steadfast dedication to Israel's security, stating her commitment was ""unwavering.""","Hassan Nasrallah's death from an Israeli airstrike is a measure of justice for his many victims, says US President Joe Biden.

Kamala Harris' team said she would be willing to attend the fundraiser as president if she's elected but on Oct 17, she will be busy campaigning.Kamala Harris' absence will make her the second major-party candidate to decline an invitation in over six decades and the first since Walter Mondale did not attend the event in 1984.Laura Loomer raised a storm after she attacked Kamala Harris' ethnicity and said if she wins the presidential election, the White House will smell of curry -- a jibe at Kamala Harris' Indian ethnicity. The attack did not get approval from the Republican party and Donald Trump distanced himself from Laura Loomer's vile comment. Several Republican veterans opposed Laura Loomer and said Loomer does not represent the GOP.Loomer herself said her allegiance is not to the GOP but only to Donald Trump. The former president called Laura Loomer a private citizen, a supporter who does not work for him or for his campaign but Loomer's closeness with Trump certainly raised eyebrows.As far as Kamala Harris' religion is concerned, Harris earlier said that as a child she was introduced to both Hinduism and Christianity and now she's married to Jewish Doug Emhoff.“She has a unique and interesting religious identity. ... She’s been part of both mainline American Baptist churches and Hindu fellowships, and she’s married to a Jewish man,” said Nathan Finn, senior fellow on religious liberty with the Southern Baptist Convention’s Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission.A Texas-based evangelist Lance Wallnau recently accused Kamala Harris of practicing witchcraft. ""She can look presidential. That’s the seduction of what I would say is witchcraft. That’s the manipulation of imagery that creates an impression contrary to the truth, but it seduces you into seeing it.

A Georgia homeowner has taken legal action against Macon-Bibb County officials, accusing them of demolishing his property without a court hearing .Eric Arnold bought the house in Macon, Georgia, in February 2022 for $15,000, which he planned to renovate for himself and his children. Arnold was renovating the property when a dumpster appeared on the site, and his house was labeled an “imminent threat to the community.” The house was demolished in November 2023.Arnold’s lawyers argue that he was unaware of any demolition plans and found no public record of Code Enforcement against the property when he purchased it.They claim Arnold had paid his taxes and obtained the necessary permits to save the home.Arnold expressed his frustration, saying, as quoted by the New York Post, “I did everything I was supposed to do. I thought I was okay. I wasn’t okay. They still knocked my house down.”Attorney Christie Herbert claimed that the county fast-tracked the demolition despite Arnold’s requests to remove the house from the list. “While he still had work to do, the yard was neat, the exterior was clean, the house was locked up, and, most importantly, it was in a vastly improved state of repair compared to when he purchased it,” Herbert said, as quoted by the New York Post.“Eric’s lawsuit isn’t just about one man’s house; it’s about protecting the constitutional rights of all property owners in Macon-Bibb County,” Herbert said during a press conference.Arnold has sought compensation for the house’s purchase and renovation costs.Macon-Bibb County officials said that they are aware of the demolition on Sunnyvale Drive. A letter was issued several years ago, designating the property as a Nuisance Per Se and blighted, with a notice that it would be torn down if not repaired, officials added.According to officials, the property was marked as blighted before Arnold’s purchase, and they hadn’t been informed of any construction permits or repairs in the past 20 months.","Eric Arnold bought the house in Macon, Georgia, in February 2022 for $15,000, which he planned to renovate for himself and his children.

The dispute quickly engulfed other areas and became a full-blown sectarian conflict , they said.In Aug, the warring sides signed a truce after clashes resulted in 50 deaths and injuries to over 200 people.Security officials said the renewed fighting led to closure of roads, triggering a shortage of food, medicines and fuel. Educational institutions have also remained shut for a week.Kurram, a mountainous area that shares a long border with Afghanistan, is home to about 700,000 people, of which more than 42% belong to the Shia community. The district's Parachinar town is one of the few Shia-dominated areas in largely Sunni Pakistan. The region has seen frequent tribal and sectarian clashes in recent years.","At least 64 people killed in fresh outbreak of violence involving Pashtun Sunni and Shia tribes of Pakistan's militancy-prone Kurram district.
