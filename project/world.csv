We had a lot of discussions on general issues. We wish to have an alliance (between NCP SP and NCP). He told me that a decision will be taken soon,” Pansare said.This comes days after NCP (SP) MP Supriya Sule hinted at a possible alliance, saying that her party is in talks with Ajit Pawar and that senior party leaders have spoken to each other.“Of course, we are looking at all alliances. Ajit Pawar constantly says that he has not given up that ideology. Right now, the focus is on the corporation elections. A lot of our colleagues have spoken to each other,” Sule had said.“We are engaged in dialogue with them, but no decision or final offer has come,” she added.Earlier, Maharashtra minister Sanjay Shirsat also said that efforts were under way in Pune to bring both NCP groups together.“Both the NCPs are coming together by forming an alliance for the upcoming municipal corporation elections,” he said, adding that such local-level adjustments could be the beginning of a broader political understanding.The undivided NCP, founded by Sharad Pawar, split in 2023, with the Ajit Pawar-led faction not only joining the BJP–Sena alliance in the state government but also bagging the “real NCP” status through an Election Commission ruling.The NCP (SP) has since been contesting against the NCP in various polls and on social issues.As municipal corporation elections in Maharashtra are expected to be held next month, various parties have been working on different alliance combinations. With the BJP having established its dominance in both the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) areas, the Ajit Pawar-led NCP has been contemplating an alliance with the senior Pawar’s party in both these municipal corporations of Pune district.",Ajit Pawar met NCP (SP) leader Azam Pansare in Pimpri-Chinchwad on Friday.

US President Donald Trump in his Christmas message on Thursday (local time) launched a sharp attack on his critics, calling them ""sleazebags"" and accusing them of having close ties with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein before ""dropping him like a dog"" and then ""blaming Trump. "" He also fired shots at Democrats and ""fake media coverage"" further warning ""enjoy what may be your last Merry Christmas.""Sharing a post on Truth Social, Trump posted, ""Merry Christmas to all, including the many Sleazebags who loved Jeffrey Epstein, gave him bundles of money, went to his Island, attended his parties, and thought he was the greatest guy on earth, only to 'drop him like a dog' when things got too HOT.""He claimed these critics ""falsely claimed they had nothing to do with him, didn’t know him, said he was a disgusting person, and then blame, of course, President Donald J Trump.""Trump further went on to assert that he was ""actually the only one who did drop Epstein, and long before it became fashionable to do so.""The US President further alleged that those who would be named in the ""ongoing Radical Left Witch Hunt"" would largely turn out to be Democrats.He said, ""When their names get brought out in the ongoing Radical Left Witch Hunt (plus one lowlife 'Republican,' Massie!), and it is revealed that they are Democrats all, there will be a lot of explaining to do, much like there was when it was made public that the Russia, Russia Hoax was a fictitious story - a total Scam - and had nothing to do with 'TRUMP.'""He also criticised the media coverage on Epstien files singling out The New York Times.""The Failing New York Times, among many others, was forced to apologize for their bad and faulty Election 'Reporting,' even to the point of losing many subscribers due to their highly inaccurate (FAKE!) coverage.

Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.Meanwhile, the US Justice Department (DOJ) has released nearly 30,000 additional pages of documents linked to Epstein, marking the largest disclosure so far in the long-running investigation.The newly released files contain multiple references to Trump, including an email from a prosecutor noting flights Trump took on Epstein’s private jet during the 1990s.In a response to the latest files released, the DOJ said that some of the latest documents released from the Epstein files contained ""untrue and sensationalist claims"" against Trump, which were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 US election.The latest disclosure follows criticism of an earlier tranche of records, some of which were briefly removed from the DOJ's online portal over concerns about protecting victims’ identities. The files were later restored after authorities determined that no victims were depicted in the disputed material.The newly released material also included hundreds of video and audio files, as well as surveillance footage from August 2019, the month Epstein was found dead in his jail cell while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.","US President Donald Trump in his Christmas message on Thursday (local time) launched a sharp attack on his critics.

When the occupants raised an alarm shouting ""robbers"", locals rushed to the spot and beat Samrat.His other associates managed to flee, while Selim was caught with weapons.""Police arrested his associate, Selim, from the scene along with one foreign-made pistol and one pipe gun. Three cases have already been filed in connection with this incident, and law enforcement agencies are continuing their investigation,"" the statement read.Meanwhile, the interim government condemned the killing and said it does not support any form of unlawful action.""The government strongly condemns this killing.

Horror In Coimbatore: Student Gang Raped After Abduction, Three Accused Shot And Arrested By Police

GWALIOR: A 26-year-old engineer died after allegedly consuming poison at his uncle’s house in Gwalior on Saturday.The man was facing a rape case under the POCSO Act in Dabra involving a 2-year-and-11-month-old girl.His family alleged that he was being blackmailed for money to “settle” the case.The deceased, identified as Love, also known as Lovejeet Singh Rana, was a BTech graduate and a resident of Ramgarh in Dabra.He had been living in Purushottam Vihar Colony with his uncle after losing his job following the registration of the case.He allegedly consumed poison on Friday night. Family members found him in critical condition on Saturday morning and rushed him to the hospital, where doctors declared him dead.According to the family, the girl’s mother had demanded Rs 60 lakh to withdraw the case.

‘We did nothing wrong’: Indian truck drivers challenge California over mass licence cancellations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/we-did-nothing-wrong-indian-truck-drivers-challenge-california-over-mass-licence-cancellations/articleshow/126177821.cms,"'Thug' Indian Truck Driver Crash In Florida Sparks US Visa Freeze, Triggers Illegal Immigration Row

Truck drivers say they are being punished for state errors

Federal pressure and political fallout

Livelihoods and supply chains at risk





Thousands of Indian truck drivers in California have launched a legal challenge against the state after being told their commercial driving licences will be cancelled. Drivers say the move threatens their livelihoods and has left their families in limbo. The lawsuit follows decisions by the California Department of Motor Vehicles to revoke licences issued to immigrant drivers after a federal audit flagged problems with expiry dates. Many of the affected drivers are Punjabi Sikhs, according to advocacy groups, who say the crackdown has led to increased profiling of drivers in the industry.The dispute centres on around 20,000 commercial driver’s licences (CDLs) that the DMV says were issued with expiration dates extending beyond the period drivers were authorised to stay and work in the United States. On 6 November, the agency sent 60-day cancellation notices to roughly 17,000 drivers, a figure that has since risen as more cases were reviewed.Civil rights groups argue the problem stems from clerical mistakes made by the DMV itself, not wrongdoing by drivers. Under California law, they say, the agency is required either to correct such errors or allow licence holders to reapply for amended documents. Instead, the DMV halted the issuing, renewal and correction of non-resident CDLs, leaving drivers with no clear way to fix the issue.“The state of California must help these drivers because the clerical errors threatening their livelihoods are of the state’s own making,” said Munmeeth Kaur, legal director of the Sikh Coalition, which filed the class-action lawsuit alongside the Asian Law Caucus.Advocacy groups say the crackdown followed increased scrutiny from the Trump administration after a fatal truck crash in Florida earlier this year became a national political issue. Federal officials accused several states, including California, of lax licensing standards and pushed tougher enforcement of immigration and English-language proficiency rules for commercial drivers.The Sikh Coalition says the response has had wider consequences, including racial profiling of Sikh truckers, many of whom wear turbans and beards as part of their faith. Industry figures warn that stricter federal policies could remove hundreds of thousands of drivers from the workforce nationwide over the coming years.For drivers, the immediate impact is stark. Losing a CDL means losing the legal right to work, while the threatened cancellation of regular driving licences would prevent them from driving at all. Many affected drivers are the sole earners for their families and have invested heavily in trucks, homes and small transport businesses.“If the court does not step in, we will see a devastating wave of unemployment that harms families and destabilises supply chains,” Kaur said.The DMV has declined to comment on the lawsuit but has previously said it is prepared to reissue licences if federal objections are lifted. The plaintiffs argue the agency already has the authority under state law to correct or reinstate the licences without waiting for Washington.","Thousands of Indian truck drivers in California have launched a legal challenge against the state after being told their commercial driving licences will be cancelled.

India's beloved former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee remained unmarried his entire life, but there was a time when he was proposed to by a woman, a Pakistani woman to be precise.On the late prime minister's 101st birth anniversary on Thursday, defence minister Rajnath Singh narrated the anecdote, recalling Vajpayee's repartee and sense of humour.Singh recalled that during Vajpayee's visit to Lahore, a Pakistani woman reporter proposed to him, inspired by his speech.""I would like to share one incident. Inspired by his speech, a Pakistan i reporter said she was ready to marry him, but sought ceding of Jammu and Kashmir to Pakistan in Mehr,"" Singh said.Atalji, with a smile on his face, said, 'Madam, I am ready to marry you, but in return, I want Pakistan as dowry,"" Singh said, drawing laughter and applause from the audience.Vajpayee definitely had a way with his words. He was admired for his oratory skills across parties and was an accomplished poet known for his patriotic and humanist compositions.Once, when a supporter urged him to remain ""atal"" (unshakeable), Vajpayee quipped back playfully, with, ""Atal toh hoon, lekin Bihari bhi hoon!"" (“I am Atal, but I am also a Bihari!”).Vajpayee travelled to Lahore by bus in 1999 and embraced Pakistan’s then prime minister Nawaz Sharif, a gesture that came to symbolise hope for better ties between the two neighbours.However, the bonhomie did not last long. Just months later, the Pakistan Army carried out a covert operation to send troops into the Kargil sector of Jammu and Kashmir, triggering a limited conflict that Pakistan ultimately lost.Rashtra Prerna Sthal was inaugurated by PM Modi on Thursday and has been developed as a landmark national memorial and inspirational complex of enduring national significance.

CHANDIGARH: Punjab and Haryana high court has ordered that a man convicted of raping and murdering a five-year-old girl remain behind bars for 30 years without remission, holding that his incarceration must continue until he nears loss of ""virility"" to prevent further sexual crimes.""To save other children and women, the convict must remain within the four walls of the prison until he is closer to the sunset of his virility,"" a division bench of Justices Anoop Chitkara and Sukhvinder Kaur ordered after commuting the convict's death sentence.The case dates to May 31, 2018, when the child was raped and stabbed to death in a village in Haryana's Palwal district by the man, who was a long-time employee of her father. Her body was stuffed into a flour storage drum in the courtyard of his house.CCTV footage from a nearby school showed him leading the child towards his home. He was convicted of kidnapping, rape, murder, criminal conspiracy, and destruction of evidence IPC and Pocso Act , and sentenced to death.He appealed in HC, which upheld his conviction but spared him the gallows and acquitted his mother of the charge of shielding him.""In a civilised society, this barbaric incident would not have happened, and if it did, a mother would have preferred justice for 'Laado' (the name given to victim by the court) than for her 'Raja-beta',"" the bench observed, adding: ""This social attitude, however appalling, is not new.It is deeply embedded in the region's patriarchal mindset and culture.""HC was of the view that to be proportionate, any sentence must be stable and balanced like a table, and for any table to be stable, all its legs must be comparable. Thus, the courts, while awarding a sentence, are under an obligation to consider the crime, victim, criminal and his family, society and the state, the bench observed.HC observed that the facts on record indicate a gruesome crime because 'Laado' was walking with the convict, swaying one hand and letting the convict hold her other hand in absolute trust, ""without the mental age or information to suspect the probable evil of a devil"".However, the convict has no criminal antecedents, and his conduct in prison is not violative, which makes reformation possible, HC observed.

SRINAGAR: Mirwaiz Umar Farooq removed on Thursday his designation as Hurriyat Conference chairman from his social media handle, blaming the move on “pressure” from J&K authorities and calling it a “Hobson’s choice”.“For some time now, I was being pressed by the authorities to make changes to my X (formerly Twitter) handle as all constituents of Hurriyat Conference, including Awami Action Committee that I head, have been banned under UAPA, making Hurriyat a banned organisation, failing which they would take down my handle,” Mirwaiz said.He bemoaned the alleged “pressure” that had shut out a key outreach outlet for him since Thursday. “At a time when public space and avenues of communication stand severely restricted, this platform remains among the very few means available to me to reach out to my people and share my views on our issues with them and the outside world,” Mirwaiz said.Most of Hurriyat’s 20-odd constituents have been proscribed since the Aug 2019 abrogation of Article 370 and J&K’s conversion into a Union territory.The social media curbs came as Mirwaiz was put under house arrest, preventing J&K’s chief cleric from addressing Friday prayers at Srinagar’s historic Jamia Mosque. Since his release in Sept 2023 after being under house arrest for four years following the abrogation of Article 370, Mirwaiz has frequently faced such restrictions, with police often detaining him at home on Fridays without offering any explanation.The social media move unleashed trolling against Mirwaiz, with many accusing him of compromising on Hurriyat’s ideology. But former CM and PDP president Mehbooba Mufti described the removal as “immaterial”, arguing that Hurriyat “is an idea and reflects alienation”. “You can remove names from any platform but you have to address this idea of Hurriyat,” Mehbooba said.PDP MLA Waheed Parra backed Mirwaiz, saying choosing “peace over rigidity is not weakness, it is leadership”.Tanvir Sadiq, spokesperson for J&K’s governing National Conference (NC), slammed the alleged coercion. “Mirwaiz is a religious scholar, and if he is being pressured, then it is wrong,” Sadiq said.BJP described Mirwaiz’s move as the “right decision”. “It is a message to J&K’s youth that the road of separatism has ended,” spokesperson Altaf Thakur said.",Mirwaiz Umar Farooq removed his designation as Hurriyat Conference chairman from his social media handle.

NEW DELHI: People's Democratic Party (PDP) chief Mehbooba Mufti on Friday lost her cool with a journalist who asked her to speak in Urdu instead of Kashmiri, which the former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister was using at the time.As soon as she began her press conference in Kashmiri at the PDP headquarters in Srinagar, a journalist asked her to speak in Urdu.“Do you want a translation? Why? Translate it. Why don’t you ask Stalin to speak in English or Urdu?” Mufti snapped, referring to Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin, who speaks only Tamil, his native language.She further urged Kashmiri journalists to “show some respect” for their language.“This is the only thing that is left now, so respect the Kashmiri language a little,” the former chief minister said, before continuing her address in her mother tongue.Mufti also spoke about the lynching of two Hindu youths in separate incidents in neighbouring Bangladesh, drawing a parallel with the ""intolerant"" situation in India.“The intolerance in the entire country has increased. Lynchings are taking place.What is happening in Bangladesh pains us, but those who criticise it remain mute spectators when lynchings take place here,” she told reporters.The PDP chief further urged the Jammu and Kashmir government to send ministerial teams to various states to ensure the ""safety"" of Kashmiris living there.""Our government should send a ministerial team to every state and especially to Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, and Haryana, where most such incidents take place,"" she said.Mufti's remark came in the wake of an alleged assault on a shawl seller from the Union territory in Uttarakhand. She also took credit for the arrest of the accused.""I immediately put out a tweet and tagged the Uttarakhand DGP, seeking his intervention. That is why the accused was arrested. There are still some officers in the police who respond. But three incidents took place in 72 hours? In Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Haryana. What is happening is distressing,"" she added.",Mehbooba Mufti lost her cool with a journalist who asked her to speak in Urdu instead of Kashmiri. The former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister was using Kashmiri at the time. She also spoke about the lynching of two Hindu youths in separate incidents in Bangladesh.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126192171,imgsize-45106,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design.jpg"

NOIDA: A Class 10 student died by suicide early on Dec 23, allegedly hours after she was pulled up by her teachers and principal at a private Greater Noida West school for using AI on her mobile phone to write her pre-Board exam papers.The girl's father submitted a police complaint on Thursday seeking an FIR against the school management, the principal and two teachers, accusing them of abetment to suicide and mental harassment.While police are examining allegations before registering an FIR, the principal told TOI that the student, though reprimanded, was not harassed and told that cheating in the board exam could earn her a five-year suspension from writing the test.According to the minor's father, the 16-year-old allegedly jumped from her eight-floor flat early on Dec 23. He alleged that his daughter was deeply distressed after she was scolded and humiliated by teachers for bringing her phone to the exam hall on Dec 22.In his complaint, the father said he has three daughters, all of whom study at the same school. He alleged that his eldest daughter had ""unknowingly"" carried her mobile phone to school on the day of the exam.She was caught by the invigilator, who reprimanded her and informed her class teacher. The student was then taken to the principal.The principal called the girl's parents to the school, and her father arrived shortly afterwards. He alleged that even in his presence, the teachers and principal continued to scold and insult the student aggressively. He also claimed that he was called ""careless"" by the teachers.The father claimed his daughter was shaken by the incident and that the harsh words used by her teachers had a severe psychological impact. He named the child's class teacher, Poonam Dubey, another teacher, Taapas, and the school management in his complaint, accusing them of pushing his daughter towards taking an extreme step.He has urged police to register a case under BNS Section 108 (abetment of suicide), and other relevant provisions. He claimed the incident had left his other two daughters traumatised and fearful of returning to the school.The school has strongly denied the allegations. The principal told TOI over the phone that the student was not harassed and that the school followed standard protocol prescribed by the Central Board of Secondary Education . ""The girl was found with a mobile phone during the pre-board examinations. When the invigilator checked the device, it appeared that she had been using AI to get answers. The phone was confiscated, and she was brought to the examination head, who then brought her to me,"" the principal said.She said she had informed the student that using such methods during the CBSE board examinations could lead to a ban of up to five years from appearing in the exams. ""That is the rule, and the child was only told about the consequences,"" she said. According to the principal, the student's parents were informed immediately and reached the school within 10 to 15 minutes, as they lived nearby. She said the interaction took place at the reception area and was brief.","A Class 10 student died by suicide early on Dec 23, allegedly hours after she was pulled up by her teachers and principal at a private Greater Noida West school.

Himachal Pradesh: Doctors launch indefinite strike after colleague sacked over assault; demand immediate reinstatement,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/himachal-pradesh-doctors-launch-indefinite-strike-after-colleague-sacked-over-assault-demand-immediate-reinstatement/articleshow/126198150.cms,"There’s a video of Raghav Nirula thrashing the patient, but Resident Doctors’ Association says his side of the story hasn’t been considered



Ambulance staff stop work over wages

SHIMLA/KULLU: The Resident Doctors’ Association (RDA) of Indira Gandhi Medical College, Shimla — following backing from Himachal Medical Officers Association and RDAs of other medical colleges — announced an indefinite strike from 9.30 am Saturday, demanding immediate reinstatement of Dr Raghav Nirula, who was sacked on the recommendations of an inquiry report for assaulting a patient on December 22.They will be joined by govt doctors in other health facilities across the state. All routine services, OPDs and elective operation theatres will remain closed, but emergency services will continue to function, IGMC RDA announced Friday.CM Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu’s promise of a fresh inquiry cut no ice with the doctors, who see Nirula’s sacking as a “mob trial”. There’s a video of Nirula brutally thrashing the patient, who is also seen kicking him while lying in bed, but RDA said Nirula’s side of the story hasn’t been considered, and the termination is unjust.Himachal residents are already facing the brunt of the protest as govt doctors, excluding those on emergency and VIP duties, went on mass casual leave. Long queues were seen at OPD counters of regional and zonal hospitals in Kullu, Dharamshala, Una and Mandi.On Friday morning, representatives of IGMC RDA, HMOA and State Association of Medical and Dental College Teachers met the CM with their demands. RDA president Dr Sohail Sharma told mediapersons that Sukhu listened to them in detail, “considered all available evidence” and promised a fresh inquiry.The association alleged that Nirula received “direct threats to his life” and was warned to “leave the country”. RDA called for the immediate revocation of Nirula’s termination order. The association expressed concern over instances of “mob intimidation” inside the hospital, saying safety of healthcare workers was under threat and services were disrupted. It has demanded registration of FIRs and legal proceedings under BNS.“A fresh inquiry should be conducted to find out the exact circumstances that led to this incident. Moreover, govt should inquire into the threats made against the doctor by the patient’s attendants,” said Dr Satyavrat Vaidya, posted at Regional Hospital, Kullu.Former BJP CM and current LoP in assembly, Jai Ram Thakur, on Friday termed Nirula’s sacking a “harsh” move. “The decision to terminate Dr Raghav seems to have been taken in a hurry. A suspension order with a warning would have sufficed,” he said. RDA has also sought legal action over the vandalism of govt property during the December 22 fracas, and steps to end CCTV and security deficiencies at IGMC-Shimla.To add to patients’ woes, around 1,300 employees of 108 and 102 ambulance services also went on a two-day strike across the state on Friday , demanding minimum wages.They staged protests and stopped work, impacting emergency services across Himachal. Protests were held in Una, Shimla, Kullu, Solan, Nahan, Chamba, Mandi, Dharamshala and Hamirpur as employees raised slogans against the company hired by the health department to run ambulance services.The employees’ union has alleged the firm isn’t giving them the basic salary ordered by various courts, including HP HC.","Routine services, OPDs and elective operation theatres will remain closed, but emergency services will continue to function.

'Santa Claus fainted due to Delhi AQI’: FIR filed against AAP leaders for hurting religious sentiments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/bharadwaj-2-other-netas-booked-over-santa-skit-aap-and-bjp-spar/articleshow/126177803.cms,"Image Credit: AAP

Delhi’s Air Pollution Gets Attention, But Most Indian Cities Are As Bad Or Worse | I Witness

NEW DELHI: An FIR was registered on Thursday against Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) functionaries Saurabh Bharadwaj, Sanjeev Jha and Adil Ahmad Khan for allegedly outraging the religious feelings of Christians.The FIR was filed on the complaint of a lawyer after the party posted a video on its official social media accounts on Dec 17 and 18, featuring a skit performed at Connaught Place. According to the complainant, the skit depicts Santa Claus in a humorous and derogatory manner.The controversy stems from the scenes in which a person dressed as Santa is shown collapsing on the street and is used as a ""prop"" to seemingly deliver a political message. The complainant alleged that the AAP functionaries mocked Santa by showing CPR being performed on him — ""a direct insult"" to the sanctity of St Nicholas and Christmas.BJP called it an ""indecent and objectionable act"" and ""a mockery of religious faith"".Denying the allegations, Bharadwaj said the skit helped take the issue of Delhi's air pollution to the masses, thus putting both the city and Union govts under pressure.The complainant further alleged that the actions were deliberate and malicious as they coincided with the final days of Advent. A case was registered under Sections 299, 302, and 3(5) of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) that pertain to deliberate acts intended to outrage religious feelings, with common intention.The FIR states that the collective actions of Bharadwaj, a former minister; Jha, the Burari MLA; and Khan, a national executive member of AAP, also threaten communal harmony in the city.The complainant furnished AAP's Instagram handle and a Facebook link to the video as primary evidences.Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva said, ""Such conduct is not befitting of any socially responsible individual. Those who work as public representatives in the political arena have an obligation to maintain their seriousness and dignity.""AAP alleged that the FIR was part of a broader pattern of BJP intimidating opposition functionaries using Enforcement Directorate (ED), Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and now Delhi Police. ""Their propaganda is being exposed, so they are scared. We need to expose them more and scare them further. BJP workers are now donning the mask of Christians,"" Bharadwaj, AAP Delhi unit president, said.The party also claimed that BJP's objections over issues like this have been selective. ""Caps of individuals dressed as Santa were recently yanked off in Lajpat Nagar and they were threatened, abused and chased away. However, the religious sentiment of no Christian worker of BJP was hurt in that case,"" said Bharadwaj.","Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) functionaries Saurabh Bharadwaj, Sanjeev Jha and Adil Ahmad Khan are accused of outraging the religious feelings of Christians.

Putin 'TEASES' Zelensky; Offers Ukraine Land Captured By Russian Troops But Not Donbas | Report





Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday that he will meet US President Donald Trump in Florida over the weekend, as diplomatic efforts continue to bring an end to the war between Russia and Ukraine.Speaking to reporters, Zelenskyy said the discussions on Sunday will focus on security guarantees for Ukraine. He said negotiators are close to finalising a proposed 20-point peace framework, which “is about 90% ready.”The upcoming talks come as Washington leads a broad diplomatic initiative aimed at stopping Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which began on February 24, 2022. Progress has been difficult due to major disagreements between Kyiv and Moscow over key conditions for ending the conflict.Zelenskyy said his announcement followed a “good conversation” on Thursday with US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, the US president’s son-in-law.Earlier in the week, Zelenskyy said Ukraine would consider pulling its forces out of parts of the eastern industrial region if Russia does the same. Under his proposal, the area would become a demilitarised zone overseen by international monitors.Also read: 'Terrorist scum': Why Trump ordered US strikes on ISIS in Nigeria — what it means Moscow has not signaled acceptance of such a plan. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Thursday that negotiations were showing “slow but steady progress,” but Russia continues to press its own demands, reported AP.The Kremlin insists that Ukraine surrender the territory it still controls in the Donbas, a demand Kyiv has rejected. Russian forces currently occupy most of Luhansk and roughly 70% of Donetsk, the two regions that make up the Donbas.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that contacts between Russian and US officials are ongoing following a recent meeting in Florida between Russian presidential envoy Kirill Dmitriev and US representatives. “It was agreed upon to continue the dialogue,” Peskov said.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he will meet US President Donald Trump in Florida over the weekend.

KALYAN: Negotiations over seat-sharing between Shiv Sena and BJP for the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) polls appear to be nearing a resolution. Sources indicated consensus has been reached on 116 of the total 122 seats, with discussions underway for just six seats. Earlier, during a meeting of the coordination committee, BJP had sought 83 of the 122 seats.It had also staked claim to the mayor's post for the five-year term and the chairperson's post for 2.5 years. These demands were reportedly opposed by Sena, which has dominated KDMC for years. To break the deadlock, a meeting was held between BJP state president Ravindra Chavan and Dy CM Eknath Shinde and MP Shrikant Shinde.However, even during this round of talks, no agreement could be reached. The stalemate, however, showed signs of easing on Friday when leaders met again. BJP reportedly agreed to scale down its earlier demand of 83 seats. This helped in resolving disagreements over several seats, with both parties appearing closer to a broad n understanding on most seats.","Negotiations over seat-sharing between Shiv Sena and BJP for the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) polls appear to be nearing a resolution.

Thailand and Cambodia on Saturday agreed to an immediate ceasefire, ending weeks of deadly border clashes.In a joint statement, both the countries said that the ceasefire will include all types of weapons, including attacks on civilians, civilian objects and infrastructures, and military objectives of either side, in all cases and all areas. """"Both sides agree to an immediate ceasefire after the time of signature of this Joint Statement with effect from 12:00 hours noon (local time) on 27 December 2025, involving all types of weapons, including attacks on civilians, civilian objects and infrastructures, and military objectives of either side, in all cases and all areas,"" the statement from the countries' Special General Border Committee, issued by the Cambodian side said.This comes after violence between Cambodia and Thailand intensified on December 8–9 after the July ceasefire collapsed. During the recent escalation, Thailand deployed fighter jets and artillery strikes and Cambodia responded with rocket fire.Clashes have been reported across contested sections of the Thailand–Cambodia border, especially around the Dangrek mountain range, which spans northeastern Thailand and northern Cambodia.The roots of the dispute go back to the early 1900s, when boundary lines were established under French colonial administration in Cambodia. Thailand has maintained that some of the maps produced at the time inaccurately defined the border and failed to follow natural watershed boundaries referenced in earlier agreements.During the December escalation, US President Donald Trump said he had spoken separately with the leaders of Thailand and Cambodia and claimed they had agreed to stop the fighting. He described the talks as positive, saying both governments had pledged to “cease all shooting” and work towards restoring a peace arrangement similar to previous ceasefires.Despite these statements, reports of clashes continued, highlighting a disconnect between diplomatic announcements and realities on the ground. Officials in both Thailand and Cambodia later confirmed the outreach but said that conditions for a ceasefire had not yet been fully satisfied.More recently, Thailand’s caretaker Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul confirmed that he had spoken with Trump but said Thai military operations would continue until there were no further threats to Thai territory or civilians. He accused Cambodian forces of breaching ceasefire commitments and said the border situation remained volatile.","Thailand and Cambodia agree to an immediate ceasefire, ending weeks of deadly border clashes.

The Mahayuti formula has been finalised and is in its final stage. Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis himself is taking the lead. I have held several meetings with Ravindra Chavan. Some parties may get more or fewer seats, but we will fight together and win. Our agenda is clear — to bring real change in the lives of people in Mumbai and Kalyan-Dombivli,” Shinde said while addressing a large public rally in Dombivli. He also held back-to-back rallies in Kalyan after Dombivli as part of preparations for the KDMC polls.Targeting the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), Shinde questioned the opposition’s role during recent municipal council elections. “Where were you when workers were on the ground? You abandoned them repeatedly, while Mahayuti leaders were campaigning everywhere. We fought, we won, and we honoured our workers. A Shiv Sena worker is never left alone,” he said.Shinde also accused Thackeray brothers of exploiting Marathi identity and Mumbai’s name for power. “Mumbai is not a hen that lays golden eggs. It is the financial capital of the country and the pride of Maharashtra. People know who comes together only for power. Whether it is Mumbai, Kalyan or Dombivli, the saffron flag will continue to fly,” he asserted.Reiterating Shiv Sena’s ideological position, Shinde said Marathi pride, Hindutva and development remain inseparable. “Dombivli is not just a city; it is a centre of culture, ideology and Hindutva. Shiv Sena will never compromise on Hindutva for power,” he said.Shinde also outlined key development projects undertaken by the Mahayuti government in the region, including metro rail connectivity, ring road construction, double-decker flyovers and cement concrete roads. He announced that an international-standard vertical sports stadium at the Sawlaram Sports Complex is under construction and expected to be operational within 18 months.He further spoke about a 200-bed cancer hospital, redevelopment of Shastrinagar Hospital, and cluster redevelopment schemes to provide permanent housing to eligible residents.Addressing the gathering, Lok Sabha MP Shrikant Shinde stressed that Kalyan-Dombivli has historically stood firmly with the alliance. “Our workers have been working within the alliance for many years. Some people try to create confusion or throw obstacles within the alliance, but Dombivli is a stronghold of the alliance and a constituency that believes in Hindutva. That is why we have always remained committed to the alliance,” he said.Shrikant Shinde said neither he nor Eknath Shinde ji had ever spoken about breaking the alliance. “Whenever we have spoken, we have said only one thing — that the mayor in Kalyan-Dombivli will be from the alliance. Today, our MLAs, MPs and corporators are united. No one should attempt to weaken the Mahayuti, especially when so much development work has been carried out here,” he added.Taking dig at the Thackeray brothers, Shrikant Shinde questioned their claims of representing Marathi interests. “They speak about the Marathi identity and say they have united for the Marathi people. My question is — what have you actually done for the Marathi people? During your tenure, the Marathi population was pushed out of Mumbai because they could not afford homes,” he said.He alleged that Marathi families were forced to move to areas such as Kalyan, Ambernath and Karjat, while thousands continued to live in transit camps in Mumbai for 14 to 15 years without permanent housing. “If anyone has provided homes to the Marathi people, it is Eknath Shinde. Show even one project where you delivered housing for them,” he challenged.Shrikant Shinde also highlighted infrastructure improvements in the region, including flyovers, closure of railway crossings, metro expansion, ring road projects and 100% cement concrete roads in MIDC areas, saying the scale and pace of development were unprecedented.The rally concluded with calls to strengthen Shiv Sena and the Mahayuti alliance ahead of the civic elections, with leaders expressing confidence that the alliance would retain its dominance in Kalyan-Dombivli.",Deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde said that the polls will be contested under the Mahayuti alliance. He also held back-to-back rallies in Kalyan after Dombivli as part of preparations for the KDMC polls.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126199481,imgsize-1384547,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/deputy-cm-eknath-shinde.jpg"

The panchayat also laid down rules to regulate wedding ceremonies, including restrictions on guest lists and curbs on what it termed unnecessary expenditure, according to news agency ANI.As per the resolutions, teenagers—particularly those below 18–20 years—will not be allowed to use smartphones. Phones, if needed, should be kept at home and not given directly to children. The panchayat also decided that weddings should be held in villages or at homes rather than in marriage halls, arguing that large, commercial ceremonies strain relationships and finances. Invitations, it said, should preferably be sent through WhatsApp instead of printed cards.Thamba Desh Khap Chaudhary Brajpal Singh said the decisions reflect the collective will of society.“The decision taken by society is supreme. Similar steps taken in Rajasthan are commendable. We also plan to ban smartphones and half-pants for boys. Children should spend time with family elders to receive proper education and social guidance,” he said, adding that boys aged 18 to 20 do not need mobile phones.Dagadh Khap Chaudhary Ompal Singh echoed similar views, saying unrestricted access to mobile phones could lead to “bad habits”. “The same rule will apply to boys and girls. Phones should remain at home. As for weddings, they should be simple and held within the village. Marriage halls create unnecessary complications in relationships,” he said.Local resident Naresh Pal said the decisions were taken by consensus. “There is no need to give phones to minors. Phone use in schools is a separate matter, but at home it must be regulated. This decision is timely,” he said.The khap panchayat said it plans to implement these guidelines across Uttar Pradesh and will reach out to other khaps to run a coordinated awareness campaign at the village level.",A khap panchayat in Uttar Pradesh ’s Baghpat district has issued a set of social guidelines.

China on Friday announced sweeping countermeasures against 20 US defence-related companies and 10 senior executives, freezing their assets and banning business dealings in response to Washington’s approval of large-scale arms sales to Taiwan.The Chinese foreign ministry said the sanctions were imposed under China’s anti-foreign sanctions law and would take effect immediately.The move follows the US administration’s approval of a major arms package for Taiwan valued at over $10 billion, according to the US state department.Under the measures, all movable and immovable assets of the sanctioned companies located in China will be frozen, while Chinese organisations and individuals will be barred from conducting business or cooperation with them.Restrictions were also imposed on 10 senior executives, including Palmer Luckey, founder of Anduril Industries, limiting their assets and activities related to China.The sanctioned entities include major US defence firms such as Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation, L3Harris Maritime Services, Boeing (St Louis), Gibbs & Cox, VSE Corporation, Sierra Technical Services, Red Cat Holdings, Teal Drones, ReconCraft, Epirus, Dedrone Holdings, Area-I, Blue Force Technologies, Dive Technologies, Rhombus Power and Lazarus Enterprises, among others, the ministry said.Beijing said the US arms sales to Taiwan “seriously violate the one-China principle and the three China-US Joint Communiques, interfere in China’s internal affairs, and undermine China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” according to the foreign ministry statement carried by the Global Times.A ministry spokesperson said the Taiwan issue was at the core of China's national interest. “Anyone who attempts to cross the line and make provocations on the Taiwan question will be met with China’s firm response. Any company or individual who engages in arms sales to Taiwan will pay the price for the wrongdoing. No country or force shall ever underestimate the resolve, will and ability of the Chinese government and people to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity,” the spokesperson added.China also urged the US to honour its commitments, stop supplying weapons to Taiwan and avoid actions that could raise tensions in the Taiwan Strait, warning that it would continue to take “resolute measures” to protect its sovereignty and security.The sanctions follow the Trump administration’s approval last week of a major arms package for Taiwan, which the US state department said includes medium-range missiles, howitzers and drones. According to Focus Taiwan, the proposed sale could include eight arms packages, such as HIMARS rocket systems, anti-tank missiles and drones, with an estimated total value of $11.1 billion.Five of the packages are covered under a NT$1.25 trillion ($39.85 billion) special defence budget proposed by Taiwan’s government and awaiting legislative review, Focus Taiwan reported, citing the island’s defence ministry.China has repeatedly opposed US arms sales to Taiwan, warning that such moves threaten regional peace and stability.","China announces sweeping countermeasures against 20 US defence-related companies and 10 senior executives, freezing their assets and banning business dealings.

Trump Quizzes Kids On Christmas, Then Drops US Border Warning As Melania Watches; 'No Bad Santa...'





US President Donald Trump has said he personally ordered American airstrikes against Islamic State-linked militants in northwestern Nigeria to be delayed so they could be carried out on Christmas Day, describing the operation as a “Christmas present. ”The strikes, launched a day after Christmas, marked a rare and highly symbolic escalation of US military involvement in Nigeria’s long-running security crisis.Speaking to Politico, Trump said the operation had originally been scheduled earlier in the week but that he intervened to change the timing. “They were going to do it earlier, and I said, ‘nope, let’s give a Christmas present,’” he said. Trump claimed the militants did not expect the attack and insisted the strikes were devastating, adding that “every camp got decimated”.The president first announced the strikes on social media, framing them as retaliation for the killing of Christians by Islamic State militants “at levels not seen for many years, and even centuries”. His comments initially raised concerns in Nigeria about a potential breach of sovereignty. Nigerian and US officials later confirmed that the operation was jointly coordinated and had the approval of Nigerian President Bola Tinubu.Nigeria’s Information Minister Mohammed Idris said the attack was carried out with the full involvement of the Nigerian armed forces, describing it as part of ongoing intelligence sharing and strategic cooperation between Abuja and Washington. US Africa Command confirmed there were multiple casualties but did not specify which armed faction was hit.Nigerian authorities said two Islamic State enclaves inside the Bauni forest in Sokoto state were targeted. The strikes were carried out using guided missiles launched from Reaper drones operating from maritime platforms in the Gulf of Guinea. Some debris reportedly fell in parts of Sokoto and neighbouring Kwara state, but the government said no civilians were injured.","US President said he personally ordered airstrikes against Islamic State-linked militants in Nigeria to be delayed so they could be carried out on Christmas Day.

California floods kill three





Severe storms across the United States during the Christmas holiday caused widespread travel disruption, with more than 1,800 flights cancelled and thousands delayed. Meanwhile, catastrophic flooding in California has claimed at least three lives, officials said.Holiday travel was hit hardest as winter storm Devin swept across large parts of the country, bringing heavy snow to the Northeast and Midwest and record-breaking rainfall to California.According to flight-tracking website FlightAware, airlines cancelled 1,802 flights and delayed over 22,000 more by Friday afternoon, as millions of Americans attempted to return home after Christmas.The Upper Midwest, Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions experienced a white Christmas, with snow, sleet and freezing rain affecting road and air travel. New York’s major airports: John F Kennedy International, Newark Liberty and LaGuardia, were among the worst hit, accounting for more than half of all flight cancellations nationwide. JetBlue cancelled the most flights, followed closely by Delta Air Lines, Republic Airways and American Airlines, Reuters reported.Spokespersons for American Airlines, United Airlines and JetBlue said that change fees had been waived for affected passengers.Explaining the scale of disruption, a JetBlue spokesperson said, “Due to winter storm Devin, JetBlue has canceled approximately 350 flights today and tomorrow, primarily in the Northeast where JetBlue has a large operation.”Ahead of the storm, New York and New Jersey declared states of emergency. Announcing the move, New York Governor Kathy Hochul said, “As widespread snowfall is expected to start in New York City and its surrounding areas this evening, I will declare a State of Emergency to ensure that our agencies and local partners have the resources and tools they need to respond to the storm.”New Jersey Acting Governor Tahesha Way also urged caution to travellers. In a statement, she said, “This storm will cause dangerous road conditions and impact holiday travel. We are urging travellers to avoid travel during the storm and allow crews to tend to the roads.”The National Weather Service warned that winter storm Devin would create hazardous travel conditions from the Great Lakes to the northern Mid-Atlantic and southern New England through Saturday morning.In New York City and surrounding areas, forecasters predicted snowfall rates of one to two inches per hour, with total accumulation of up to 11 inches in some locations. New York City Emergency Management advised residents, “Do not travel unless you absolutely have to.”While snow battered the Northeast, California faced a very different crisis. Historic rainfall from a powerful atmospheric river flooded streets, triggered mudslides, caused mass power outages and forced water rescues across the state. Officials said three people died in weather-related incidents between Sunday and Wednesday.Among them was Sacramento County sheriff’s deputy James Caravallo, who died in a single-vehicle crash while driving to work on Christmas Eve, with authorities believing wet road conditions played a role. In San Diego, Roberto Ruiz died after a large tree branch fell on him during the storm, sending him into cardiac arrest, NBC reported.Mountain communities such as Wrightwood, northeast of Los Angeles, were among the worst affected, receiving nearly a foot of rain. Floodwaters reached homes and buried vehicles in mud. One resident described waking up to a “river running through our property.”Residents recounted frightening scenes as the storm intensified. Jill Jenkins, who was spending Christmas in Wrightwood with her grandson, said, “It’s really a crazy Christmas.” Her grandson, Hunter Lopiccolo, described how the family coped during power outages, saying, “We just played card games all night with candles and flashlights.”Others carried out rescues on their own. Davey Schneider said he hiked through floodwaters to save pets trapped in his grandfather’s home. “I wanted to help them out because I wasn’t confident that they were going to live,” he said, adding, “Fortunately, they all lived. They’re all okay — just a little bit scared.”San Bernardino County fire department spokesman Christopher Prater said crews encountered extreme conditions during rescue operations. “We saw some very dire situations,” he said. Prater added that several residents were trapped in homes by up to five feet of mud and water.Governor Gavin Newsom declared emergencies in six California counties, placing firefighters, first responders and the National Guard on standby. Officials said the storm brought the wettest Christmas period to downtown Los Angeles in more than 50 years, with flood watches remaining in effect for millions of people due to runoff risks.As California’s storms began to ease, forecasters warned that winter weather in the Northeast could continue to disrupt travel through the weekend, with lighter snow and icy roads expected on Saturday.","More than 1,800 flights cancelled and thousands delayed across the U.S. as winter storm Devin swept across large parts of the country.

A Florida man shot and killed his wife, critically wounded his teenage stepdaughter and later took his own life following an alcohol-fuelled argument over an NFL game, authorities said.Polk County Sheriff’s officials said Jason Kenney, 47, became enraged after his wife, Crystal Kenney, asked him to turn off a Monday Night Football broadcast featuring the San Francisco 49ers and the Indianapolis Colts. Investigators said Kenney had been drinking when the argument escalated.During the confrontation, Crystal Kenney told her 12-year-old son to call 911. The boy fled to a neighbour’s home, where he later heard gunshots. Deputies responding to the Lakeland residence found Crystal Kenney dead and her 13-year-old daughter suffering gunshot wounds to the face and shoulder. The girl was rushed to hospital in critical condition but survived and later told investigators she begged Kenney not to shoot her.After the shooting, Kenney fled the scene and contacted a relative, telling her he had “done something bad,” according to authorities.Deputies tracked him to his deceased father’s home in nearby Lake Wales, where he fatally shot himself inside a shed as police attempted to negotiate.Sheriff Grady Judd said investigators recovered a handwritten note from Crystal Kenney urging her husband to seek help for alcohol and drug abuse. Relatives also told deputies that Kenney had a history of physically abusing his wife, though no prior domestic violence calls had been reported from the home.The couple’s other children, including the 12-year-old boy and a one-year-old daughter the couple shared, were unharmed. The surviving children are now in the care of their grandparents. Sheriff’s officials described the case as devastating, calling the teenager’s survival a “Christmas miracle.”","Jason Kenney became enraged after his wife, Crystal Kenney, asked him to turn off a Monday Night Football broadcast featuring the San Francisco 49ers and the Indianapolis Colts.

Trump Greenlights Putin's Role In Israel-Syria Security Deal As Netanyahu Navigates Saudi Backlash





US President Donald Trump has said any peace deal to end the war between Ukraine and Russia will ultimately depend on his approval, casting himself as the final decision-maker ahead of talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Florida.Speaking in an exclusive interview with Politico on Friday, Trump appeared unenthusiastic about Zelenskyy’s latest peace proposal, a revised 20-point framework that the Ukrainian leader is expected to present during their meeting on Sunday.The plan includes ideas such as a demilitarised zone and requests for US security guarantees.“He doesn’t have anything until I approve it,” Trump said, referring to Zelenskyy’s proposal. “So we’ll see what he’s got.”Zelenskyy has said the meeting will focus on key unresolved issues, including security guarantees, control of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and territorial questions surrounding the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine.According to the New York Times, Zelenskyy has described the agenda as broad and said “a lot can be decided before the New Year”.Trump’s remarks underline how dependent Kyiv’s future strategy has become on convincing the US president that Ukraine is prepared to compromise.While Washington has pushed Zelenskyy to soften some of his earlier demands, Russia has largely held to its hardline position and has not publicly responded to the latest proposal, reported Politico.Despite his scepticism, Trump said he expected the talks to be constructive. “I think it’s going to go good with him. I think it’s going to go good with [Vladimir] Putin,” he said, adding that he hopes to speak with the Russian president “soon”.The comments came a day after Zelenskyy held discussions with Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and the president’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, which the Ukrainian leader later described as a “good conversation”.As per the New York Times, Zelenskyy said those talks produced “good ideas” and new thinking on formats and timelines for pushing diplomacy forward.Zelenskyy’s proposal includes the creation of a demilitarised zone in parts of Donbas still under Ukrainian control, but only if Russia withdraws its forces from a corresponding area in Donetsk.Moscow has shown no sign of accepting anything short of full control of the region, highlighting the wide gap between the two sides.Trump also said Russia was under economic pressure. “Their economy is in tough shape, very tough shape,” he told Politico.During the interview, Trump confirmed that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would also visit him this weekend. “I have Zelenskyy and I have Bibi coming. They’re all coming,” he said.“They respect our country again.” According to an NBC report cited by Politico, Netanyahu is expected to brief Trump on the growing threat from Iran.Trump’s remarks followed US airstrikes against ISIS targets in Nigeria, which he said were delayed by a day for symbolic reasons. “I said, ‘nope, let’s give a Christmas present,’” he told Politico, claiming the strikes had heavily damaged militant camps.As diplomacy continues, Zelenskyy has said Ukraine is ready to show flexibility but warned that if Russia refuses to engage seriously, stronger pressure from the West would be needed to bring the war closer to an end, reported the New York Times.","US President Donald Trump is due to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Florida on Sunday.

‘People will die…’: Elon Musk slams Zohran Mamdani’s appointment of first openly gay FDNY commissioner,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/people-will-die-elon-musk-slams-zohran-mamdanis-appointment-of-first-openly-gay-fdny-commissioner/articleshow/126198316.cms,"Mamdani Distances Himself As NYC Official Quits In Disgrace Over ‘Indefensible’ Anti-Jew Posts





Elon Musk has criticised New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani over his decision to appoint Lillian Bonsignore as commissioner of the Fire Department of New York, warning that the choice could have serious consequences for public safety.Reacting to a news clip announcing the appointment, Musk wrote on social media, “People will die because of this. Proven experience matters when lives are at stake.” The clip highlighted that Bonsignore will become the FDNY’s first openly gay commissioner, a milestone that Mamdani has framed as part of his broader leadership vision.Musk’s criticism focused on the fact that Bonsignore, despite decades of service within the department, has never worked as a firefighter. His comments quickly spread online, intensifying debate over whether top leadership of the FDNY should come from a firefighting background or whether broader emergency management experience is sufficient.Bonsignore is a 31-year veteran of the FDNY who began their career as an emergency medical technician in 1991 and later rose through the ranks to become chief of the department’s emergency medical services.They oversaw EMS operations during the COVID-19 pandemic and retired in 2022. FDNY data shows that EMS units now respond to more than 70 per cent of the department’s emergency calls, a statistic supporters cite as evidence of their extensive operational and administrative experience.Mamdani has described the appointment as historic, noting both the symbolic and practical significance of elevating a long-serving EMS leader to the commissioner role. Supporters argue that the position is primarily managerial, with responsibility for strategy, budgets and coordination across the department, while frontline firefighting decisions are handled by senior uniformed officers with specialised expertise.Critics maintain that leading one of the world’s largest fire departments requires direct firefighting experience, particularly during major fires, large-scale disasters and complex rescue operations. Musk’s remarks have amplified those concerns and pushed the appointment into a wider national discussion about leadership standards, public safety and how political priorities shape senior emergency service roles in New York City.","Elon Musk has criticised New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani over his decision to appoint Lillian Bonsignore as commissioner of the Fire Department of New York.

Visa revocation means nothing if you are in the US

Visa revoked after leaving the US

Don't travel even if you don't have any criminal record, valid visa stamp





Immigration attorneys commented on a new trend they have been observing since the beginning of December, that visas are getting revoked without any valid reason. Immigration attorney Rahul Reddy said the new trend is confusing, as people who have, for example, a DUI case 12 years ago and followed all the rules, got the stamping after disclosing everything to the authorities, are suddenly getting their visas revoked for the same 12-year-old DUI.H-1B, H-4, and F-1 visas are being revoked in large numbers.Earlier, revocation used to occur only when new information is found about any individual, like any involvement in fraud or criminal activity that the US admin was not aware of before or when the visa was granted, Reddy explained. ""There is no public statement but visas are getting revoked,"" Reddy said.Immigration attorney Emily Neumann said apart from the State Department's random social media posts reminding everybody that having a visa is a privilege and not a right and it can be revoked any time, there has been no statement from the authorities on why these visas are getting revoked.""These are people who already disclosed all their information. It's not that there's ne information that causes the Department of State to question whether you qualify. They have already determined that these people qualify. In some cases, they even got their visa stamping done during the current Trump administration. But still got their visas revoked. So that tells me this has nothing to do with actual public safety,"" Emily said.Neumann explained that these visa revocations mean nothing unless you leave the US. It doesn't take effect until they leave the US and they will have to go for stamping again and show the same documentsSome NRI groups on social media pointed out that people are getting their visas revoked once they land in India. Several people received the message that their visas had been prudentially revoked when they left the US. It means they can't re-enter the US using the same visa and will have to get a fresh visa interview. All visa interviews in India are randomly deferred as the Department of State has started social media vetting.Both Reddy and Neumann emphasized that H-1B visa holders should avoid traveling outside the US even if they have a valid visa stamping and even if they have no criminal record, because rules are changing every month. ""You should not travel until this administration is out of office,"" Neumann said.","H-1B, H-4, and F-1 visas are being revoked in large numbers.

Billionaire Elon Musk slammed a Canadian hospital after an Indian-origin man died due to the negligence of the medical staff.Prashant Sreekumar, 44, a father of three, died after being kept waiting for hours at Grey Nuns Hospital in Canada. In a viral video, Prashant Sreekumar's wife said that the Grey Nuns Community Hospital neglected her husband's condition even after he complained of severe chest pain.Commenting over the viral video, Musk said, ""When the government does medical care, it is about as good as the DMV.""In the video, the wife was heard saying, ""He was brought to Grey Nuns Community Hospital around 12.15 pm. He was sitting in the triage from 12.20 pm onward till about, I would say, 8.50 pm in the night. He was sitting in the triage complaining of constant chest pain. His BP constantly kept on rising, with the last recorded blood pressure of 210. He… he was taken inside. He was only prescribed Tylenol during the entire waiting time that he was outside, and he was not given help. They said that chest pain is not considered an acute problem. They do not suspect a cardiac arrest,” she added.Further, she said that her husband collapsed, while nurses at the hospital were heard saying that they couldn’t feel his pulse.“When we came inside, he was asked to sit down. He got up for a fraction of seconds and he collapsed. He fainted. And the nurse was heard saying that I do not feel a pulse. So basically the hospital administration, the employees of Grey Nuns Hospital, have killed my husband, Prashant Sreekumar, by not providing him timely medical help,” she said.“And the security was so rude that instead of addressing the cause, they said, ‘Ma’am, you are being very rude.’ So basically it is okay for them to kill a human being and to tell the wife that you are being rude,” she added.","Prashant Sreekumar, 44, a father of three, died after being kept waiting for hours at Grey Nuns Hospital in Canada.

Meet Mora Namdar: Trump appoints beauty salon owner to oversee US passport and visa approvals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/meet-mora-namdar-trump-appoints-beauty-salon-owner-to-oversee-us-passport-and-visa-approvals/articleshow/126194936.cms,"Who is Mora Namdar

The beauty salon business

A powerful role in US immigration policy

Links to Project 2025





Donald Trump has appointed Mora Namdar as Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs, placing her in charge of US passport issuance and visa approvals. The role gives Namdar significant authority over who is allowed to enter or remain in the United States, at a time when immigration and travel rules are again a central focus of the administration. While she has prior experience in government, the appointment has attracted attention because Namdar is also the owner of a chain of beauty salons in Texas, an unusual background for one of the State Department’s most powerful operational posts.Mora Namdar is a US attorney and government official who is the daughter of Iranian immigrants and a native of Texas. She is fluent in Persian and has spent years working on US foreign policy, particularly issues related to the Middle East and North Africa. This is not her first time in the consular role. Namdar previously served as acting Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs in 2020 during Trump’s first term, giving her direct experience overseeing visas and passports.Before her latest appointment, she held senior positions within the State Department, including work in the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, and served in legal and compliance roles at the US Agency for Global Media.Alongside her public service career, she founded and ran her own law firm. In a recent statement, Namdar indicated that the firm is no longer operating in an active capacity, as she focuses fully on her government role.Outside Washington, Namdar is also known as the owner of a mini-chain of beauty salons operating under the name Bam in Texas. The salons offer blowouts, professional makeup services, hair extensions and styling for events. In past interviews, Namdar described the brand as “fun and cheeky” and said the original salon was inspired by friends asking her to do their makeup for weddings and special occasions. She has spoken about wanting to treat beauty and styling as a form of art rather than a routine service.For years, she balanced running the salons with her legal and government work, a combination that has now become a focal point of public discussion following her appointment.As Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs, Namdar oversees one of the most influential bureaus in the State Department. The office handles millions of passport applications annually and plays a central role in deciding who receives, keeps or loses a US visa. Consular officers under her leadership have the authority to deny or revoke visas on grounds ranging from security concerns to foreign policy considerations.In Senate testimony, Namdar has described visa adjudication as a critical national security function, arguing that the US must retain broad discretion to refuse entry to individuals seen as undermining American interests.Namdar has also been linked to Project 2025, a wide-ranging conservative agenda that has influenced Trump’s second term. She contributed to the project by authoring a chapter focused on the US Agency for Global Media, in which she accused the organisation of mismanagement and security risks. She contributed to the project by authoring a section critical of the US Agency for Global Media, accusing it of mismanagement and security risks and calling for major reform or even closure.Although Trump sought to distance himself from Project 2025 during the campaign, many contributors to the initiative have since been appointed to senior roles across the administration, reinforcing the idea that personnel choices are a key mechanism for implementing its priorities.","Mora Namdar is the daughter of Iranian immigrants and a native of Texas.

The Indian-origin doctor whose plans to save lives were undone by Trump’s gutting of USAID,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/the-indian-origin-doctor-whose-plans-to-save-lives-were-undone-by-trumps-gutting-of-usaid/articleshow/126193625.cms,"Donald Trump’s Allegation Of $21 Million USAID Funding For India Elections Debunked By US Embassy





USAID was built to make survival feel ordinary. It existed so that childbirth would not be a gamble, hunger would not quietly hollow out childhoods, and outbreaks would be spotted early enough to remain footnotes rather than funerals. Its work was repetitive and procedural by design, because global health only improves when prevention becomes routine. When the system worked, no one noticed. When it stopped, the damage registered everywhere at once.Atul Gawande understood this logic long before he ever entered government. The Indian-origin surgeon and writer made his career by rejecting medicine’s addiction to heroics and insisting instead on discipline, design, and follow-through. People did not die, he argued, because solutions were missing; they died because systems failed to carry those solutions to the bedside consistently. His famous insistence on checklists, pauses, and enforced communication was not about reducing ambition but about reducing avoidable error. It was a philosophy built for scale.When Gawande was appointed assistant administrator for global health at USAID in 2022, he found himself responsible for a machine that mirrored his beliefs.The agency’s global health division spanned dozens of countries, supporting maternal and child health, infectious disease control, nutrition, and surveillance networks that could identify outbreaks like Ebola or avian flu within days. It was not a laboratory of innovation so much as a factory of follow-through, converting existing medical knowledge into predictable outcomes for people who rarely benefit from predictability.Gawande left the role in early 2025, just before Donald Trump returned to office. The dismantling that followed was swift and destabilising. USAID’s operations were frozen, staff were dismissed, and the bulk of its programmes were terminated or abandoned mid-stream. From the vantage point of Washington, this was framed as reform and reassessment. From the field, it felt like gravity being switched back on.Health systems do not fail theatrically. They erode. Vaccination schedules slip. Supply chains fracture. Outreach workers disappear. Clinics continue to exist in name long after their capacity to intervene has been stripped away. A child with moderate malnutrition becomes severely malnourished because there is no longer anyone tracking the warning signs. A mother arrives too late because the system that once pulled her forward has gone silent. Biology does not pause to negotiate with ideology.Gawande later described the result as a “devastating global health void,” a phrase that captured not shock but absence. What vanished was not just funding, but the connective tissue that allowed fragile health systems to hold. The surveillance that caught outbreaks early. The nutrition programmes that prevented irreversible decline. The institutional memory that allowed progress to accumulate instead of resetting with each political cycle.Rather than retreating into abstraction, Gawande chose to bear witness. He returned to Harvard speaking less like a former official than like a clinician describing organ failure. “It’s not just having a solution; it’s the follow-through,” he said, repeating the principle that had guided his work from operating rooms to refugee camps. He warned that while the agency itself might not be rebuilt in its original form, the scientific and human infrastructure it supported still mattered, and that losing it would not be easily reversible.This is where the story sharpens. The tragedy here is not ignorance or incompetence. It is the deliberate dismantling of a system that worked precisely because it refused to be dramatic. USAID did not save lives through spectacle or ideology. It saved them through consistency. It turned survival into a process rather than a plea.Gawande’s career has been devoted to proving that most deaths are preventable when systems are designed to absorb human fallibility. Watching those systems be broken by political choice exposes a harder truth: progress is fragile not because it is idealistic, but because it is boring, and boredom is easily mistaken for waste.The plans to save lives were already in motion. The mechanisms existed. The outcomes were measurable. What failed was not medicine, or knowledge, or intent, but the willingness to let quiet systems keep doing their work.That is not an ending. That is a warning.","Atul Gawande was appointed assistant administrator for global health at USAID in 2022. The dismantling that followed was swift and destabilising.

'Just a junta with nuclear weapons': When Bush and Putin discussed Pakistan in 2005; what declassified NSA documents show,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/just-a-junta-with-nuclear-weapons-when-bush-and-putin-discussed-pakistan-in-2005-what-declassified-nsa-documents-show/articleshow/126187276.cms,"Putin Called Pakistan A Junta With Nukes As Bush Feared Nuclear Leaks To Iran, Reveal Transcripts





NEW DELHI: Pakistan’s nuclear proliferation programme triggered deep concern at the highest levels of the United States and Russia, with both countries expressing that Islamabad’s nuclear activities made them “nervous”, according to newly declassified documents released by the US National Security Archive.The documents, made public this week following a Freedom of Information lawsuit, include verbatim transcripts of meetings and phone calls between former US president George W Bush and Russian president Vladimir Putin between 2001 and 2008. They reveal repeated discussions on Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal, links to Iran’s nuclear programme, and the role of the AQ Khan proliferation network.In a key Oval Office meeting in 2005, Putin raised concerns over evidence suggesting Pakistani-origin uranium had been found in Iranian centrifuges, questioning Western tolerance of Islamabad despite its proliferation record.“But it's not clear what the labs (Iran) have, where they are. Cooperation with Pakistan still exists,” Putin said during the meeting.Bush responded by referring to his discussions with then Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf, saying, “I talked to Musharraf about that. I told him we're worried about transfers to Iran and North Korea. They put AQ Khan in jail, and some of his buddies under house arrest. We want to know what they said.I keep reminding Musharraf of that. Either he's getting nothing, or he's not being forthcoming.”Putin reiterated his concerns, stating, “As far as I understand, they found uranium of Pakistani origin in the centrifuges.”Bush acknowledged the issue, saying, “Yes, the stuff the Iranians forgot to tell the IAEA about. That's a violation.”“It was of Pakistani origin. That makes me nervous,” Putin said, to which Bush replied, “It makes us nervous, too.”Also read: 'I want Pak': Rajnath recalls Vajpayee's unmatched wit; all about iconic moment The documents also highlight Putin’s blunt assessment of Pakistan during an earlier meeting with Bush in Slovenia in 2001. “I am concerned about Pakistan. It is just a junta with nuclear weapons. It is no democracy, yet the West makes no criticism of it. Should talk about it,” Putin said.According to the transcripts, both leaders expressed anxiety about Pakistan’s internal political instability, its military-led governance under Musharraf, and the risk that sensitive nuclear technology could fall into the wrong hands. The discussions repeatedly returned to the AQ Khan network, which was later confirmed to have supplied nuclear technology to Iran, North Korea, and Libya.The declassified records underscore longstanding international concerns about Pakistan’s nuclear command and control systems and the broader implications of its proliferation activities.The revelations come amid renewed scrutiny of Pakistan’s nuclear conduct. Last month, India criticised Islamabad following remarks by US President Donald Trump alleging that Pakistan had been secretly testing nuclear weapons.Reacting to Trump’s comments, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said such actions were consistent with Pakistan’s history. “Clandestine and illegal nuclear activities are in keeping with Pakistan's history, which is centred around decades of smuggling, export control violations, secret partnerships, AQ Khan network and further proliferation,” he said.“India has always drawn the attention of the international community to these aspects of Pakistan's record,” Jaiswal added."," transcripts of meetings and phone calls between former US president George W Bush and Russian president Vladimir Putin released by US National Security Archive.
