SC Troubled by CBI’s Report on RG Kar Doctor Rape-Murder: Evidence Tampering Suspected,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/were-disturbed-by-findings-of-cbis-rg-kar-report-sc/articleshow/113439625.cms,"CBI line of probe indicates justice will be done: Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: In a setback to West Bengal government, Supreme Court on Tuesday said it was ""very disturbed"" by the status report of the CBI probe finding serious faults with the way Kolkata Police collected evidence and secured the crime scene in RG Kar Hospital where a doctor was raped and murdered on Aug 9.A bench led by CJI D Y Chandrachud made this observation after the counsel for the original petitioner before Calcutta HC accused state police of employing a bizarre process for search and seizure, and alleged that the crime scene was deliberately left unguarded to let vandals destroy vital evidence.""What you are flagging is of the utmost concern. CBI itself is very concerned that this has happened,"" CJI told the counsel.""CBI is investigating... whether there was tampering with the scene of crime, whether evidence was destroyed and whether any other person (apart from those arrested) was involved,"" SC said.It will be unwise for us to reveal anything at this stage, which may enable suspects to destroy evidence. Making a disclosure today of what the CBI is doing will jeopardise the course of investigation. We cannot also disclose the lines of further investigation of CBI,"" the SC bench, also comprising Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, said.The bench assured the parents of the victim and the resident doctors, who have been agitating for justice since the crime, that the line of investigation indicated that justice would be done, and the perpetrators of the crime would be brought to book.""We can assure you that the line of further investigation which is being carried out by CBI is intended to unearth the absolute truth and further truth and any further leads that may emerge apart from the accused who have been arrested. We will keep it at that so as not to jeopardise the investigations,"" the bench said, its comment appearing significant in view of Trinamool's frequent sniping at the premier investigating agency.Appearing for senior doctors of RG Kar and other hospitals in Kolkata, senior advocate Karuna Nundy said senior doctors had evidence in their possession that clearly established a link between the heinous crime and financial irregularities . The bench asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta to instruct CBI to file probe status report before the SC on the next date.""Apart from the principal, the SHO has been arrested. He is in the custody of CBI and very significant pieces of evidence may be revealed during the investigation. CBI has responded specifically to the queries which all of us raised during the last hearing, including whether the 'challan' and statutory form were submitted for post-mortem, what document was submitted by Kolkata Police for the purpose of post-mortem,"" the bench said.",CBI probe finds serious faults with the way Kolkata Police collected evidence and secured the crime scene in RG Kar Hospital where a doctor was raped and murdered on Aug 9.

They also sought resettlement that ensures continuity for the younger generation with their roots through this initiative.The community members termed the government's proposal to provide jobs and official quarters in Kashmir to 5,000 Kashmiri migrant youths, including Muslims and Sikhs, as merely symbolic.They argue that this gesture undermines the return and rehabilitation needs of the 300,000-strong community.There was little effect of a poll boycott call given by Panun Kashmir and other organisations who were pressing for the enactment of a law to ensure legal recognition of alleged atrocities against the community.""The only demand we have consistently voted for over the years is our collective right to a homeland in Kashmir.

This is a critical concern for preserving our 5,000-year-old civilisation,"" said Vaibhav, a young voter studying medicine.Young voters from the community advocate for innovative solutions to address this humanitarian issue and call for a united effort by all parties to save their ancient civilization in the Valley.Most voters expressed optimism about participating in assembly elections after a decade, unaffected by the poll boycott calls. pti",Displaced Kashmiri Pandits voted with a collective demand to establish a 'homeland' in the Valley.

Any decision taken by Parliament can be changed. If the five judges of the Supreme Court ruled in favour of the abrogation, is it not possible that tomorrow a seven-judge bench would rule in favour of Article 370 again.""Abdullah's comments came in response to Shah's statement made at an election rally in Jammu on Monday, where the home minister said that Article 370, which granted special autonomy to Jammu and Kashmir , is now a historical relic and will not be reinstated.Abdullah also criticised the BJP-led central government for the surge in terror incidents in Jammu and Kashmir. ""It has been six years that the control has been with the central government. If terror attacks are occurring, if yatris are attacked in Reasi, if armed forces and officers are being targeted, who is responsible?"" he said, holding the central administration responsible for the recent uptick in violence.The NC leader also challenged Shah to address the issue of rising terrorism in the region, saying that the BJP should be answerable for the escalation in attacks. “You can blame us for our faults, but if terrorism is increasing in Jammu, it is the BJP that should be held accountable,” Abdullah added.Abdullah expressed confidence in the NC-Congress alliance's prospects in the upcoming Jammu and Kashmir assembly elections.

In Mandi, hundreds gathered on Jail Road, protesting against a mosque that partially stands on Public Works Department (PWD) land.The police used water cannons and tear gas to disperse the protesters and imposed prohibitory orders to prevent gatherings of five or more people.Protestors, chanting Hanuman Chalisa, attempted to breach barricades near the mosque.The protests in Mandi followed similar unrest in Shimla’s Sanjauli area, where violent demonstrations erupted over another mosque’s illegal construction. In both cases, Hindu organisations have been calling for the demolition of unauthorised structures.The situation in Mandi escalated after the local court ordered the demolition of the illegal portion of the mosque within 30 days, a decision announced just hours before the protests.According to authorities, members of the mosque committee had already started demolishing the disputed structure, located on PWD land. Iqbal Ali, a representative of the mosque committee, stated that the community had voluntarily removed the illegal section. However, despite these efforts, protests still broke out, with more than 700 police personnel deployed to maintain law and order.As tensions persist, authorities are working to calm the situation, with both the Mandi and Sanjauli mosque controversies now under the spotlight. Political figures like BJP spokesperson Chetan Bragta have criticized the government’s response, while the local Muslim community has expressed a willingness to follow legal procedures.

Foley's opinion on the lawsuit

One of the greatest personalities in Pro Wrestling and one of the prominent 90’s rivals of the Deadman Undertaker , Mick Foley has come in support of former WWE Chairman, Vince McMahon . Vince is surrounded with controversies and lawsuits levied against him and other WWE officials, since the last one year. While attending the ‘ Comic-Con ’ Northern Ireland, the former WWF(now WWE) Champion had a few words of appreciation for his former WWE Boss Vince, while attending a Q&A session.One of the icons of extreme and no holds barred wrestling, Mick Foley was famous for his epic rivalries with the likes of The Undertaker, Kane and Triple H, in the late 90’s. He was a genuine superstar of the “Attitude Era” of WWE and paved the way for hostile and dangerous stunts that are performed in the ring. Recently, when he was enquired about Vince McMahon’s sexual assault case , Foley was surprisingly full of praise for his boss of the 90’s and didn’t want to jump to conclusions about the case levied on Mr. McMahon, Brock Lesnar and other administrative people of WWE. Notably, the case was filed by former WWE employee Janel Grant, who claims to have been sexually assaulted and exploited by Mr. McMahon and other WWE personnel.While appreciating McMahon, Foley said “I genuinely liked him. My relationship was never the same with him, after I left WWE and went to TNA for three years. But to this day, I’m still trying to find an address to write to him, or just to thank him for taking a chance on me. I think all of us are a combination of good traits and bad traits and you hope your good traits outweigh your bad traits and it seems perhaps that Vince got it backwards there for a little while. But I’ve been there when he’s done good things, I've seen him do good things.” Clearly, Mick is still fond of Mr. McMahon, and has some good memories with the former CEO of the biggest wrestling promotion in the world.About the lawsuit, Foley stated “I’m gonna hold off judgement, until I see the(documentary series), but I think one thing that’s fortunate, is whatever he did or did not do, I don’t think many of us are allowing that to mess with our memories. He was instrumental in creating some of those memories, so I’m choosing to appreciate him until I learn more about what may have gone down.” What do you think about the cases filed on Mr. McMahon.

He labeled the incident as an ""Israeli aggression"".

In an unprecedented security breach faced by Hezbollah in years, pagers used by them blew up simultaneously across Lebanon on Wednesday.The remote explosion in the pagers killed at least nine and injured over 3000 people, mostly the Hezbollah militants and medics.It has been reported that the explosions were part of a well-planned attack that Israel's Mossad spy agency had been working on for months.Mossad reportedly infiltrated into a production unit of a Taiwan-based company Gold Apollo that made the pagers and installed explosives into the devices meant for supply to Hezbollah in Lebanon.News agency Reuters has confirmed that the design and name on the exploded pagers were consistent and were linked to the company that produced it.However, Gold Apollo issued a statement saying that the devices were made by a company in Europe that had the right to use its brand.The explosions maimed many Hezbollah members, according to footage from hospitals reviewed by Reuters. Wounded men had injuries of varying degrees to the face, missing fingers and gaping wounds at the hip where the pagers were likely worn.Israel had reportedly planted 3-gram explosives in most of the 5,000 pagers delivered to Hezbollah.""We really got hit hard,"" a senior Lebanese security source, who has direct knowledge of the group's probe into the explosions, told news agency AP.Israel, however, has not claimed responsibility for the blasts.Iran-backed Hezbollah had issued directives to its members to use pagers -- which were prevalent during the mid-90s -- instead of phones, which are highly traceable and could have made targeted strikes for Israel certainly easier.After the killing of senior commanders in targeted Israeli airstrikes, Hezbollah was using pager as a low-tech strategy to evade its foe's sophisticated surveillance technology.Hezbollah has also been using its own tech – drones – to study and attack Israel's intelligence gathering capabilities in what Hezbollah's leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, has described as a strategy of ""blinding"" Israel.A Hezbollah official described the pager explosions as the ""biggest security breach"" the organisation had experienced in almost a year of conflict with Israel.""The enemy (Israel) stands behind this security incident that targeted the devices,"" the official said, without elaborating.The Israeli military, which has been engaged in a cross-broader exchange of fire with Hezbollah since last October, coinciding with the Gaza war, has kept mum on the entire development.Pagers, also known as beepers, are wireless telecommunications devices that receive and display alphanumeric or voice messages. They were widely used in the 1980s but are still relied upon by specific groups, such as medical professionals.A source identified a photograph of the model of the pager used by Hezbollah, an AP924.As the fear of escalation grows deeper in the wake of pager blasts, it will not be the first time when Israel and Hezbollah may enter into a direct conflict.In July, a rocket strike on a soccer field in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights killed at least 11 children and teens, making it the deadliest attack on an Israeli target along the northern border since the conflict with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah reignited.In retaliation, Israel carried out an airstrike in Beirut, Lebanon's capital, killing at least three people.The Israeli military claimed that the strike targeted a Hezbollah commander allegedly responsible for a deadly rocket attack in the contested Golan Heights, which resulted in the deaths of 12 youths.","Pagers used by Hezbollah blew up simultaneously across Lebanon on Wednesday.

'Had to sign or face consequences': Venezuela’s opposition leader claims he was forced to admit defeat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/had-to-sign-or-face-consequences-venezuelas-opposition-leader-claims-he-was-forced-to-admit-defeat/articleshow/113474027.cms,"The Venezuelan opposition presidential candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia , on Wednesday, revealed that he was forced to sign a letter distributed by Venezuelan authorities, in which he supposedly admitted defeat to Nicolas Maduro in the election. The letter, which was addressed to Jorge Rodriguez, the national assembly leader, said ""I respect"" the CNE electoral council 's proclamation that Maduro has emerged victorious on the July 28 vote.The 75-year-old retired diplomat took to X from Madrid, where he was granted asylum after weeks of hiding in Venezuela and said that he was coerced into singing the letter in exchange for being allowed to leave.He disclosed that ""I had to either sign it or deal with the consequences,"" when, aides of Maduro brought him the letter at the Spanish embassy in Caracas.Urrutia further said that ""there were very tense hours of coercion, blackmail and pressure. At that point, I considered I could be of more use free than if I were imprisoned."" He emphasised that the letter was invalid due to the ""coercion"" involved.Shortly after the polls closed, the CNE proclaimed Maduro the winner with 52 percent of the votes. The opposition immediately disputed the results, and numerous countries refused to acknowledge Maduro's claim to a third six-year term unless the CNE released a comprehensive vote breakdown, which it has not done.The United States said that there was ""overwhelming evidence"" that Gonzalez Urrutia had won, and the opposition presented its own figures based on polling station-level counts, which it claims proves Gonzalez Urrutia's landslide victory.Gonzalez Urrutia asserted on Wednesday that ""as the president elected by millions and millions of Venezuelans who voted for change, democracy and peace, I will not be silenced."" He departed for Spain under the shadow of an arrest warrant, which was denounced by the international community, for ""serious crimes"" related to his insistence that Maduro had stolen the election.The charges against Gonzalez Urrutia stem from the opposition's publication of voting results, which the government claims only authorized institutions have the right to do. The CNE has stated that it cannot publish the voting records due to data corruption by hackers, although observers have noted that there is no evidence of such interference.Jose Vicente Haro, Gonzalez Urrutia's lawyer, told AFP on Wednesday that his client had been subjected to ""blackmail"" by the Maduro government. In a video call hours before his departure for Spain, Haro described seeing a man ""under a lot of pressure, in a situation of coercion, under a situation of urgency, with little chance of speaking."" He added, ""I saw a person broken psychologically, emotionally.""Gonzalez Urrutia replaced opposition leader Maria Corina Machado on the ballot at the last minute after she was barred from running by institutions loyal to the Maduro regime. She, too, has been mostly in hiding since the vote, except for appearing at a handful of organized demonstrations.Maduro has said that both Gonzalez Urrutia and Machado belong ""behind bars,"" holding them responsible for the deaths of 25 civilians and two soldiers in protests that erupted spontaneously after his alleged victory was announced. Nearly 200 people were injured, and more than 2,400 were arrested.Despite sanctions that were intensified after his 2018 reelection, which was also dismissed as a sham by dozens of countries, Maduro has managed to maintain his grip on power.","Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia says he was forced to sign a letter in which he supposedly admitted defeat to Nicolas Maduro in the election.

In March, Sean Diddy's Lon Angeles mansion was raided by the police. Various supplies meant for freak off sessions or orgies including drugs, 1,000 bottles of baby oil were seized during the raid. In an earlier lawsuit, Diddy's girlfriend Casandra Ventural said Diddy used his position of power to coerce her into a romantic and sexual relationship. She said Diddy used to regularly beat and kick her, leaving her with black eyes, bruises. This lawsuit was filed in 2023.

At least 9 people were killed and over 2,000 people, including hundreds of Hezbollah members, fighters and medical personnel, sustained serious injuries on Tuesday after thousands of pagers exploded across Lebanon .Two of the deceased were Hezbollah fighters, read an official statement.A Hezbollah official described the pager explosions as the ""biggest security breach"" the organisation had experienced in almost a year of conflict with Israel.""The enemy (Israel) stands behind this security incident that targeted the devices,"" the official said, without elaborating.The Israeli military , which has been engaged in an exchange of fire with Hezbollah since October, coinciding with the Gaza war , did not provide an immediate response to the incident.Hezbollah accused Israel of being responsible for the explosions that resulted in the deaths of eight individuals.The Iran-backed organization in a statement said, ""We hold the Israeli enemy fully responsible for this criminal aggression,"" adding that Israel ""will certainly receive its just punishment for this sinful aggression"".Iran's ambassador to Beirut Mojtaba Amani also sustained injuries when a pager detonated, according to reports from state media. The ambassador's condition was described as stable and non-life-threatening.""Iranian ambassador to Lebanon Mojtaba Amani was injured in a pager explosion ,"" state television said, adding that he was ""conscious and in no danger"".According to Reuters, the explosives that detonated in Lebanon were the most recent models smuggled into the country by Hezbollah over the past few months.The new pagers had lithium batteries that apparently exploded.Lithium batteries, when overheated, can smoke, melt and even catch on fire. Rechargeable lithium batteries are used in consumer products ranging from cellphones and laptops to electric cars.Lithium battery fires can burn up to 590 C (1,100 F).Videos circulating online showed ambulances hurrying through Beirut's southern suburbs amidst widespread chaos.Photos and videos from Beirut's southern suburbs circulating on social media and in local media showed people lying on the pavement with wounds on their hands or near their pants pockets.Even 30 minutes after the initial explosions, residents reported ongoing detonations and observed groups of individuals gathered at building entrances, checking on acquaintances who might have been injured.Lebanon's National News Agency (NNA) reported ""an unprecedented security incident involving the enemy"", with multiple detonations of handheld pagers occurring across several regions.""Dozens of injuries have been reported,"" NNA added.In response to the devastating incident, the Lebanese Red Cross deployed a significant emergency response team including more than 50 ambulances and 300 emergency medical staff to assist in the evacuation of victims.The incident comes at a time of heightened tensions between Lebanon and Israel.The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and Israeli forces have been clashing near-daily for more than 11 months against the backdrop of war between Israel and Hezbollah ally Hamas in Gaza.The clashes have killed hundreds in Lebanon and dozens in Israel and displaced tens of thousands on both sides of the border.

Hezbollah blames Israel for attacks; vows retaliation



US denies involvement

Thousands of modified pagers turned into instruments of destruction in a deadly attack against Hezbollah on Tuesday. Israeli operatives had embedded explosives in these pagers, which were originally intended for Hezbollah’s communication network. When the devices received a seemingly routine message, they detonated, causing the deaths of at least 11 people and injuring over 2,800 across Lebanon.The pagers, manufactured by Taiwan-based Gold Apollo , were initially intended for low-tech communication among Hezbollah fighters, who sought to avoid detection from advanced tracking systems.However, Israeli intelligence agents managed to insert explosive components into these devices at the production stage. The pagers were then distributed to Hezbollah under the guise of standard equipment.The operation centered on the strategic deployment of 5,000 Taiwan-made pagers, procured by Hezbollah months in advance. These devices, modified by Israel 's Mossad , were embedded with a small amount of explosives, Reuters reported quoting sources. The modification included a remote-trigger mechanism that was activated by a seemingly innocuous message received on the pagers.On Tuesday afternoon, the pagers received a coded message that appeared to be from Hezbollah's leadership. Instead of conveying instructions, the message triggered the hidden explosives within the devices. The simultaneous detonation resulted in widespread chaos and destruction, impacting not only Hezbollah members but also Iran’s envoy to Beirut.The explosives, concealed within the pagers, went undetected despite months of use. The precise details of the attack were revealed by a senior Lebanese security source who described the embedded explosives as difficult to detect with conventional scanning methods.In response to the attack, Hezbollah has vowed retaliation against Israel. The scale and effectiveness of the operation have been described as one of the most significant intelligence failures for Hezbollah in recent years. Jonathan Panikoff, a former US national intelligence officer on the Middle East, labeled it as “the biggest counterintelligence failure Hezbollah has faced in decades.”Following the attack, Hezbollah has promised retaliation against Israel, labeling the incident as “Israeli aggression.” Lebanese information minister Ziad Makary condemned the attacks, while a Hezbollah official stated, “Israel will receive its fair punishment” for the blasts.The group confirmed that among the casualties were its fighters and civilians.""This is not a security targeting of one, two or three people. This is a targeting of an entire nation,"" senior Hezbollah official Hussein Khalil said.The United States denied any involvement or prior knowledge of the explosions in Lebanon. During a press briefing, state department spokesperson Matthew Miller said that the US is currently collecting information about the incident but was unaware of it beforehand and played no role in it.""We are gathering information on this incident. I can assure you that the US was not involved and had no prior knowledge,"" Miller said.When pressed for details about the information being collected, he noted that the US is seeking facts similarly and reiterated the United States' commitment to seeking a diplomatic resolution.""We continue to collect information. I don't have any public readout. We are collecting information in the same way that journalists are across the world to gather the facts about what might have happened,"" he said.""Our overall policy remains consistent, which is we do want to see a diplomatic resolution to the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. We want to see one that allows the tens of thousands of Israelis who have been displaced from their homes and tens of thousands of Lebanese who have been displaced from their homes to return home,"" Miller added.","Israeli operatives had embedded explosives in 5,000 Hezbollah pagers.

In one way, I sort of wish the call hadn’t been made because I do feel a little — He’s so nice.‘I’m so sorry about what happened and all that.’”Trump also recounted his call with Harris, stating, “Same with Kamala today. She could not have been nicer.” When Trump mentioned the “very nice call” he had with Harris, the crowd responded with boos. However, Trump countered, “No, it was very nice.”The former president was quickly evacuated from Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach on Sunday after a Secret Service agent discovered a gunman hiding in the bushes. The gunman, Ryan Wesley Routh , 58, was found with an AK-47-style rifle, a GoPro camera, and two backpacks. Routh fled but was later arrested on I-95. This marks the second assassination attempt on Trump since July. Routh has been charged with two gun-related crimes.Both Biden and Harris have condemned the incident and political violence in general.In an interview with Fox News Digital, Trump claimed that Routh was influenced by Biden and Harris' rhetoric, attributing the violence against him to their comments. Trump accused them of inciting attacks on him while he works to save the country.Democrats have accused Trump of escalating tensions and label him a ""threat to democracy,"" particularly due to his involvement in the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot. President Biden recently criticised Trump for inciting hate, referring to his comments about Haitian immigrants, while Trump contends that Biden and Harris' policies are weakening the US and diminishing its global respect.","The former president was evacuated from Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach on Sunday after a Secret Service agent discovered a gunman hiding in the bushes.

He continued, ""therefore she and her campaign were illegally spying on me,” and labeled the situation as ""the Iran, Iran, Iran case!"" Trump questioned whether Harris would “resign in disgrace from politics” and asked if the ""communist left"" would choose a new candidate to replace her.The FBI on Wednesday said that Iranian hackers sent unsolicited emails to associates of President Joe Biden’s campaign, including excerpts from materials stolen from Trump's campaign.

He said, ""We see so many hate crimes today,"" adding that ""hate has always been a part of human existence,"" he said.He called for a cultural shift in addressing hate, ""We need to do a much better job educating people about the importance of love and respect for others.""

These emails contained excerpts from stolen materials belonging to former President Donald Trump’s campaign, aiming to entice Biden's team with the leaked information.According to the FBI, there is no evidence that any recipients responded to these emails.Kamala Harris' campaign described the emails as “unwelcome and unacceptable malicious activity,” noting they were largely dismissed as spam or phishing attempts. Morgan Finkelstein, a spokesperson for Harris's campaign, stated, “We condemn in the strongest terms any effort by foreign actors to interfere in US elections.”The emails were sent in late June and early July, prior to the Trump campaign publicly acknowledging the hack. The Trump campaign disclosed on August 10 that it had been breached and that Iranian actors had stolen and distributed sensitive internal documents. At least three news outlets—Politico, The New York Times, and The Washington Post—received confidential materials from the Trump campaign but have yet to disclose details about the content.Politico reported that it began receiving emails on July 22 from an anonymous account identified only as “Robert.” This account provided what appeared to be a research dossier on Ohio Senator JD Vance, who was later selected as Trump's running mate. The document was dated February 23, nearly five months prior to the selection.The FBI’s statement highlights ongoing Iranian efforts to disrupt US electoral processes and undermine public trust in democratic institutions. Intelligence officials noted that Iran opposes Trump's reelection, viewing him as more likely to escalate tensions between Washington and Tehran. Trump’s administration had previously ended a nuclear deal with Iran, reimposed sanctions, and ordered the killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, prompting threats of retaliation from Iranian leaders.The FBI informed Trump aides that information stolen by Iranian actors had been forwarded to Biden's campaign. Both Biden’s and Trump’s campaigns have reported implementing robust cybersecurity measures to safeguard against these threats.At a recent Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, executives from Meta, Google, and Microsoft discussed their plans to secure the upcoming election and highlighted various cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns.

The move comes after the couple petitioned the Islamabad High Court to stay the proceedings and sought acquittal.The Al-Qadir Trust case centers on accusations that Khan and his wife caused a loss of over Rs 50 billion to the national exchequer.An anti-corruption court has been overseeing the trial, where so far, the statements of 35 witnesses have been recorded, leaving only the investigating officer to be cross-examined by the defense.A two-member bench headed by Chief Justice Amir Farooq heard the plea on Wednesday. Although the bench rejected the request to completely halt the legal proceedings, it granted relief by restraining the accountability court from issuing a final verdict.Khan and Bibi's lawyers argued that recent amendments in anti-corruption laws make the charges against the former prime minister and his wife invalid.

In response, district police initiated an investigation, analyzing CCTV footage from various surveillance cameras to identify the militants responsible for the attack.The militants used PUBG's chat room as a means of communication to evade electronic surveillance, making it difficult for authorities to monitor their activities.Zahidullah, the district police officer of Swat, revealed that while investigators initially focused on a motorcycle seen in CCTV footage near the police station prior to the explosion, their efforts to identify the nature of the attack were complicated. He said police found one person using a mobile phone and they believed that it would help them to hunt down the militants. However, militants never called each other but utilised features of PUBG to avoid being traced, he added.“The militants would play PUBG to practice and motivate their group members for battle against the state and would use the chat room for communication,” Dawn quoted Zahidullah as saying.The investigation ultimately revealed that the attackers had employed an improvised explosive device (IED) constructed from a power bank, rather than a hand grenade, as initially suspected.CCTV footage led to the identification of one suspect, which subsequently resulted in the arrest of additional suspects who disclosed their affiliation with a local militant group, Murad alias Rehmatullah, associated with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan .The arrested suspects admitted to maintaining communication with their group and family members in Afghanistan through PUBG chat rooms, frequently changing mobile phones and SIM cards to avoid detection.","Militants targeted a police station in Swat, Pakistan, on August 28, killing one officer.
