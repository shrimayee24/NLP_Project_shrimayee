LUCKNOW: 50-year-old Anuj Kanaujia, a sharpshooter of the Mukhtar Ansari gang , was shot dead in a police encounter in Jamshedpur on Saturday night, the UPSTF said.The operation, conducted by a joint team of Uttar Pradesh Special Task Force (STF) Gorakhpur unit and Jharkhand Police, also left STF deputy superintendent of Police (DySP) DK Shahi injured.Kanaujia, who was on the run for over five years, was wanted in 23 criminal cases, including murder, extortion, land grabbing, and arms smuggling. The UP DGP Prashant Kumar recently increased his bounty from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 2.5 lakh for any information leading to his arrest in an effort to track him down.“The operation was launched based on specific intelligence inputs regarding Kanaujia’s movement in Jamshedpur. As the police team attempted to apprehend him, Kanaujia opened fire, shooting nearly 20 rounds and even hurling a bomb in a bid to escape. This forced the security forces to retaliate, leading to a high-intensity gunfight. During the exchange of fire, DySP DK Shahi sustained a gunshot wound to his shoulder but continued leading the operation. Eventually, Kanaujia was neutralised after sustaining multiple bullet injuries. He was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival,” said Additional DG, law and order, Amitabh Yash.Following the encounter, police recovered two pistols, a large cache of live cartridges, and mobile phones from the site. The mobile phones are now being examined for possible leads on his criminal network, an officer privy to the probe said.Kanaujia, a resident of Bahlolpur village in Chiraiyakot, Mau, had a long history of violent crimes and was one of the most feared operatives of the Mukhtar Ansari gang. His criminal record spanned multiple districts, with six cases registered against him in Mau’s Kotwali police station, five in Rani Ki Sarai, two in Dakshin Tola, and three in Chiraiyakot, apart from several others in Ghazipur and Azamgarh, the officer of STF added.In recent years, police intensified efforts to crack down on Kanaujia and his associates. As part of the statewide anti-mafia drive, authorities demolished his house in Azamgarh using a bulldozer, while his family members were booked under the Gangster Act and sent to jail, the officer added.","50-year-old Anuj Kanaujia, a sharpshooter of the Mukhtar Ansari gang, was shot dead in a police encounter in Jamshedpur on Saturday night.

NEW DELHI: Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah on Saturday linked the recent surge in terrorist activities in the Jammu region to the redeployment of army personnel to Ladakh amid Chinese incursions .He suggested that this strategic shift had created an opening for terrorist groups to exploit the security gap.Abdullah made these remarks while visiting the families of four police personnel—Balvinder Singh, Tariq Ahmad, Jaswant Singh and Jagbir Singh—who were killed in an encounter with infiltrating terrorists in Kathua’s Safiyan forest on Thursday.Two Pakistani terrorists, suspected to be from the banned Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), were also killed in the operation.Speaking to reporters, Abdullah said that encounters and terrorist attacks in the Jammu region were not new but had increased in the past three to four years. He attributed this to the military’s focus on countering Chinese incursions in Ladakh, which led to a redeployment of forces from Jammu.""When the Chinese army made an incursion into Ladakh, we needed an army to counter them. We could not remove troops from the valley, so those stationed in Jammu were sent to Ladakh, resulting in a security gap. That shortage is now being addressed,"" Abdullah stated.Abdullah stressed the need for better counter-terror strategies to prevent further loss of life. ""We must control militancy in such a way that the martyrdom of our people is stopped forever,"" he said.He also expressed gratitude for the bravery of the police officers who intercepted the terrorists before they could cause further harm. ""Had they not been stopped, I don’t know what destruction they would have caused. Our four brave officers sacrificed their lives, but many innocent lives have been saved due to their timely action,"" he said.Meanwhile, Jammu and Kashmir deputy CM Surinder Choudhary blamed Pakistan for orchestrating violence in the region, urging it to abandon its ""terrorism policy.""""Conspiracies hatched from across the border are killing our children. They (Pakistan) have been doing this for over 30 years but have achieved nothing. J&K and India will not weaken due to terrorism,"" Choudhary said during the wreath-laying ceremony of fallen head constable Jagbir Singh in Jammu, as per PTI.Choudhary further said that terrorism could not break the unity of J&K’s diverse communities. ""Our brotherhood is strong, and nobody can break it, whatever their efforts,"" he asserted.Security forces continue their search operation in the Kathua region to track and neutralise any remaining terrorists.

Srinagar/Jammu: J&K CM Omar Abdullah attributed Saturday the rise in terrorist activities in Jammu to the redeployment of troops to Ladakh following Chinese incursions in April 2020.“These (infiltrations and attacks) are not new. For the past three or four years, you have witnessed such cases in many areas of Jammu, including Reasi and even Jammu city,” Abdullah said after visiting the families of four policemen killed in an anti-terrorist operation in Kathua.Following multiple Chinese incursions in 2020, the Army deployed the “Uniform Force” of its specialised counterinsurgency unit Rashtriya Rifles to eastern Ladakh, reducing troop presence in Jammu. This created opportunities for Pakistan to push infiltrators, according to security experts.“When China attacked or entered Ladakh, we needed the Army to tackle the situation there,” the CM said. “The Army stationed in Jammu was sent to Ladakh, creating a vacuum, which is now being rectified gradually.”The region remains in mourning following the deaths of four policemen in Thursday’s gunfight in the forested Sufain area of Kathua. The slain men — head constable Jagbir Singh, constables Tariq Ahmad, Balwinder Singh Chib, and Jaswant Singh — were killed after security forces came under fire from terrorists hiding in the woods. The bodies were retrieved Friday and Saturday.Heartbreak rippled through villages as grieving families and neighbours gathered to pay their respects. In Reasi district’s Chamba, residents consoled the family of Tariq, who had promised to be home for Eid (March 31). He leaves behind his wife and a four-year-old daughter.In Khour of Jammu district, Jagbir’s family — his wife, daughter, and son — struggled to process their loss. Similar grief unfolded in Kathua’s Kanna Chak, where villagers gathered at the home of Chib, and in Londi Morh of Hiranagar, where Jaswant’s elderly parents, wife, and two young sons were inconsolable.CM Abdullah assured that the next of kin of the slain policemen would receive govt jobs and other relief under existing policies. He led the wreath-laying ceremony for Jagbir, while BJP MP Jugal Kishore Sharma and former J&K BJP president Ravinder Raina attended constable Tariq’s last rites.Two Pakistani terrorists, suspected to be affiliated with Jaish-e-Mohammed group, were also killed and weapons were seized from the site, DGP Nalin Prabhat said.Security forces expanded their search operation to nearby areas, including Billawar Heights, to track down any remaining terrorists, the DGP said. People’s Anti-Fascist Front (PAFF), a shadow outfit linked to Pakistan-based Jaish, claimed responsibility for the attack.CM Abdullah said attacks must be prevented to end the cycle of mourning. “For that, we have to control terrorism,” he said.Between May and Dec last year, J&K saw a wave of terrorist attacks, prompting heightened counteroffensives. More than 30 terrorists were killed before the region’s harsh winter set in, while security forces suffered 25 casualties — 19 in Jammu and six in Kashmir.This year, eight security personnel have died in J&K, including one soldier in Kashmir and seven in Jammu. In Feb, terrorists targeted an Army patrol with an IED near the LoC in Akhnoor, killing Capt Karamjit Singh Bakshi and Naik Mukesh Singh Manhas.According to security officials, the terrorists killed in Kathua were part of a new group infiltrating from Pakistan. The terrorists are believed to be the same group that managed to escape after a brief gunfight last Sunday evening near Sanyal village in Hiranagar sector, close to the Pakistan border. Sufain’s forests are about 35km from Sanyal village.Security sources estimate that 70 to 80 Pakistani terrorists remain active in J&K, with 55 to 60 operating in Jammu. These highly trained operatives, armed with M4 carbines and thermal imaging devices, work in small groups and exploit the rugged terrain, posing a persistent threat to the region’s stability.","J&K CM Omar Abdullah attributed the rise in terrorist activities in Jammu to the redeployment of troops to Ladakh following Chinese incursions in April 2020.

NEW DELHI: The Congress party staged a protest march in Jammu on Saturday, criticising the Central government's handling of rising terrorism in the Jammu region. The march, which started from Panjtirthi and concluded at Parade Chowk, was prompted by the recent loss of four police personnel in a two-day encounter with terrorists in Kathua district. The attack, which began on Thursday, led to the deaths of two Pakistani terrorists and left four Jammu and Kashmir Police officers dead.Congress leaders, including Jammu and Kashmir Pradesh Congress Committee working presidents Tara Chand and Raman Bhalla, led the march. Protesters voiced their frustration not only with the surge in terrorism but also with the delayed restoration of statehood to Jammu and Kashmir, a longstanding demand.Tara Chand expressed deep sorrow over the loss of security personnel and condemned the government’s inability to maintain peace. He called for immediate action to prevent further loss of life and stressed that the restoration of statehood was essential for the region’s progress. He emphasised that the people of Jammu and Kashmir deserve a peaceful environment, job opportunities, and the full protection of their rights.

What do experts say?

Is there a timeline for lifting the freeze?

What is the broader impact of this policy?

The Trump administration has paused the processing of certain green card applications, intensifying concerns among Indian immigrants, one of the largest migrant communities in the United States. The move is part of a broader immigration crackdown focused on increased scrutiny and national security checks.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) stated that the pause is in line with two executive orders signed by Donald Trump. These orders aim to enhance immigrant screening for potential fraud, public safety threats, and national security risks.The suspension impacts immigrants applying for permanent residency, including Indian nationals. With over 2.9 million Indian immigrants in the US as of 2023, many now face prolonged delays and legal uncertainties.Laura Collins, director at the Bush Institute-SMU Economic Growth Initiative, told NBC News, “All these people who are approved to remain in the United States have already passed government scrutiny.” She argued that further delays are unnecessary.Azadeh Erfani from the National Immigrant Justice Center told Newsweek, “This sweeping and indefinite stop on green card processing is yet another attempt for this administration to baselessly paint all immigrants as a national security risk.”The Trump administration has not provided any timeline for when green card processing will resume, leaving thousands of applicants uncertain about their future.This move aligns with Trump’s larger push to tighten immigration policies, including plans to deport millions of undocumented immigrants. Critics argue the pause unfairly targets legal immigrants and creates further bureaucratic hurdles.Recently, the Trump administration has detained individuals with ties to American universities, many of whom have supported pro-Palestinian causes, as part of a crackdown on immigrants. Among the detained is Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, arrested under accusations of supporting Hamas. Other individuals detained include Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist, Yunseo Chung, a US resident arrested at a protest, and Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown scholar accused of spreading Hamas propaganda.The US government has also taken action against several other activists, including Leqaa Kordia, Ranjani Srinivasan, and Alireza Doroudi, with many facing deportation or detention. Some of these individuals are accused of advocating for violence or engaging in political protests.","The Trump administration has paused the processing of certain green card applications.

What Elon Musk said on Donald Trump’s 25% import tariff announcement on auto parts

US President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on auto imports and parts. “What we're going to be doing is a 25 percent tariff on all cars that are not made in the United States,” Trump said, as he signed the order in the Oval Office on March 26. The tariffs take effect on April 3 and apply to foreign-made cars, light trucks, and key auto parts. Responding to the development, Tesla CEO and Trump ally Elon Musk said that “this will affect the price of parts in Tesla cars that come from other countries”. Musk quoted a post by Tesla Owners Silicon Valley @teslaownersSV which said that “Trump imposes 25% tariff on all cars not made in the United States. Tesla could benefit the most on this.”Clarifying the post, Musk wrote: “To be clear, this will affect the price of parts in Tesla cars that come from other countries. The cost impact is not trivial.”President Donald Trump announced plans to impose tariffs on additional goods, including pharmaceuticals, noting that most drugs available in the U.S. are manufactured abroad, primarily in China and Ireland.Regarding reciprocal tariffs, Trump stated that the U.S. wouldn’t match exact levels set by trading partners but stressed that no country would be exempt.“We're going to make it to all countries, and we're going to make it very lenient,” he said. “I think people are going to be very surprised.

The victim attempted to get up at one point, only to be tackled back down onto the concrete floor.As the attack unfolded, the boy looked around desperately for help, but instead, fellow students cheered, recording the incident on their phones, making whooping noises while he continued to endure blows to his face and the back of his head.Teachers failed to intervene effectively. Two adult men could be seen in the video approaching the fight slowly, one of them still holding a thermos, before gently pulling the attacker away without restraining him. Moments later, as the assailant stood up, he stomped on the victim’s head, knocking him unconscious.Despite the severity of the attack, no one rushed to assist the unconscious student for at least 20 seconds. Instead, onlookers continue watching, and no adults are immediately visible.It is still unclear how badly the student was injured or if he required medical treatment.In a letter to parents, the principal of Harwood Junior High confirmed the incident occurred on school grounds and stated that a full investigation was underway.“However, I want to emphasize that fighting is a severely inappropriate behavior, and this type of incident is completely unacceptable,” the principal wrote, according to WFAA.“The incident is being taken very seriously, including investigation of the complete sequence of events using video and interviews, surrounding context, actions of additional students and staff, and district processes related to student fights,” the letter added, quoted by the New York Post.The Bedford police department also investigated the incident and referred the case to the Tarrant county juvenile justice system, according to a statement posted on Facebook.","Shocking video shows a Texas junior high school student being brutally beaten by another pupil, while adults stand by with little urgency to stop the violence.

Syrian interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa announces new transitional Syrian government in Damascus

Syria’s new government was sworn in on Saturday, marking a major step in the country’s transition following the removal of Bashar al-Assad in December.The 23-member cabinet includes a mix of religious and ethnic backgrounds and is expected to lead Syria through its five-year transitional period.Unlike previous governments, this one does not have a prime minister. Instead, a secretary general will oversee its functions, as outlined in the temporary constitution signed by interim president Ahmad al-Sharaa earlier this month.While most ministers are new faces, the foreign and defence ministers retained their positions. One notable absence in the government is representation from the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) or the autonomous administration in northeast Syria. However, al-Sharaa and SDF commander Mazloum Abdi recently signed a ceasefire agreement and a deal to merge the US-backed force into the Syrian army.Stability remains the new government’s biggest challenge. Earlier this month, revenge killings in the coastal Alawite region left over 1,000 people dead. The Assad family, which ruled for decades, belongs to the Alawite minority, while most of the new leaders are from the Sunni majority.Economic troubles are also a priority. Sanctions imposed on Assad’s government over a decade ago remain in place, and the UN reports that 90% of Syrians live below the poverty line. The new government hopes that its diverse composition will help persuade Western nations to ease sanctions.Security remains a concern as well. Just hours before the government was announced, the US State Department warned of potential terrorist attacks targeting embassies and public buildings during the Eid al-Fitr holiday. The warning cited the possibility of individual attackers, armed gunmen, or explosives.","The 23-member cabinet includes a mix of religious and ethnic backgrounds.

It seems that US President Donald Trump 's national security advisor Mike Waltz's job is in danger after the Yemen war plan leak on a Signal group chat scandal.""Should I fire him?"" he inquired of his staff and associates, as controversy mounted over Waltz's accidental inclusion of a journalist in communications about an impending Yemen military operation , New York Times reported.Publicly, Trump maintained support for Waltz while criticising the media. Following Jeffrey Goldberg 's article in The Atlantic about his inclusion in the chat, Trump described Waltz as a ""good man"" who needed no apology.Privately, Trump sought counsel from various individuals within and outside his administration regarding appropriate action.He expressed dissatisfaction with media coverage to his allies but was reluctant to appear influenced by press pressure. He also indicated hesitation about dismissing senior officials early in his second term.For Trump, the primary concern appeared not to be Waltz's careless discussion of military plans on a commercial application, but rather his possible connection to Goldberg, a Washington journalist Trump strongly dislikes. The president expressed particular concern about Goldberg's contact details being in Waltz's phone.On Wednesday evening, Trump consulted with Vice President JD Vance, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, personnel chief Sergio Gor, Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff and others regarding Waltz's position.Following a Thursday Oval Office meeting with Waltz, Trump indicated by Friday morning his inclination to retain him, according to three individuals familiar with the president's thoughts.Prior to the Signal incident, Waltz faced criticism for his hawkish stance, particularly regarding Iran, contrasting with the president's preference for negotiation.The Goldberg connection provided additional ammunition for Waltz's critics.Several Trump allies questioned whether Waltz, who previously served in George W Bush's administration, aligned with the president's foreign policy objectives. Sources indicate tensions between Waltz and both Vance and Wiles regarding Iran policy.Despite the controversy, defence secretary Pete Hegseth appears secure in his position, maintaining Trump's support despite sharing Yemen strike details in the Signal thread.","US President Donald Trump's national security advisor Mike Waltz's job is in danger after the Yemen war plan leak on a Signal group chat scandal.

The US Africa Command (Africom) said on Saturday it conducted an airstrike in the Puntland region of Somalia, killing several members of the Islamic State (IS). The operation was carried out in coordination with the Somali government and targeted multiple ISIS-Somalia positions.The airstrike occurred southeast of Bosasso, a key port city in Puntland, a semi-autonomous region in northeastern Somalia. While the number of casualties was not specified, Africom said initial assessments showed multiple IS operatives were killed, and no civilians were harmed.This strike is part of a more extensive counter-terrorism operation in Somalia. Two days earlier, the US military had conducted a similar attack, and in February, Puntland authorities reported US strikes had eliminated key IS figures.Although IS has a presence in Somalia, it remains smaller than Al-Shabaab, the Al-Qaeda-linked militant group that controls large parts of the country. However, IS has been gaining influence in Puntland, which has become a key base for its operations in the region.","The US Africa Command (Africom) said on Saturday it conducted an airstrike in the Puntland region of Somalia, killing several members of the Islamic State (IS) The operation was carried out in coordination with the Somali government and targeted multiple ISIS-Somalia positions.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119735636,imgsize-40698,width-400,resizemode-4/119735636.jpg"

What turned the protests violent?



NEW DELHI: At least 100 protesters were detained after pro-monarchist agitation turned violent following clashes with security personnel in Nepal's Kathmandu.The unrest left two people dead, including a journalist, and over 30 others injured, prompting authorities to impose a curfew and call in the army.The curfew was lifted on Friday and has been lifted from 7 am on Saturday, according to a notice issued by the Kathmandu District Administration Office.The pro-monarchist agitators were demanding the reinstatement of the monarchy and a Hindu kingdom, which was abolished in 2008 as part of a peace deal that ended a decade-long civil war in which more than 16,000 people were killed.Nepalis blame corruption, economic struggles, and instability for their frustration, leading to renewed calls for the return of the monarchy.The monarchists have been demanding the restoration of the monarchy since the former king appealed for support in a video message telecast on Democracy Day (February 19).The pro-monarchy activists also held a rally on March 9 in support of the former king, who landed at the Tribhuvan International Airport from Pokhara after visiting religious places in different parts of the country.The government also decided to take all necessary steps to curb possible demonstrations and protests by pro-monarchy and pro-Hindu parties, a minister told the Post.The Nepal cabinet meeting on Friday condemned the killings and discussed the ""evolving security situation"" following protests in the Tinkune area near Koteshwar, Kathmandu.""It has become crystal clear that Gyanendra Shah (the last reigning king of Nepal) is behind all these acts. Gyanendra Shah's intent is culpable. It is time for the government to take strict action,"" said former PM of Nepal Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda.'""An investigation should be conducted to bring the criminals to justice, and Gyanendra Shah cannot be spared—given absolute freedom, it is unacceptable for the Nepali citizens, and the government should be serious about this issue,"" he added.According to authorities, the demonstration turned violent after Durga Prasai, the convenor of the agitation, broke the security barricade, riding a bulletproof vehicle, and headed towards Baneshwor, where the Parliament building is located.Those arrested included the general secretary of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, Dhawal Shumsher Rana, and a central member of the party, Rabindra Mishra, among others.Prasai, the key person behind the violent demonstration, is at large, Superintendent of Police of Kathmandu District Police Range Apil Bohara said.According to the police, 53 police personnel, 22 Armed Police Force personnel, and 35 protestors were injured in Friday's incident.During the violent demonstration, 14 buildings were set on fire and nine were vandalized. Nine government vehicles were torched, and six private vehicles were vandalized.Protesters also attacked the Kantipur Television building and Annapurna Media House in the Tinkune area.","Pro-monarchist agitation turned violent following clashes with security personnel in Kathmandu.

The three were walking home from synagogue when the tragedy struck.The woman’s four-year-old son was also struck and remains in critical condition, fighting for his life, authorities confirmed. Overall, nine people were injured in the devastating crash.The tragedy unfolded just after 1 pm on Ocean Parkway, near Quentin Road, in the Orthodox Jewish neighbourhood of Gravesend. Police said a Toyota Camry Uber and an Audi collided, sending the Audi hurtling into a crosswalk, where it struck the family.“The bang I heard, it was like an earthquake,” a witness told the New York Post. “It went on for a good 30 seconds. It felt like the world stopped for that second.”The Audi, driven by 32-year-old Miriam Yarimi, fatally hit the 35-year-old mother and her daughters, aged eight and six, NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said.“This was a horrific tragedy caused by someone who shouldn’t have been on the road,” Tisch stated at a press conference at the scene.The woman’s husband, who was at home with their infant at the time, was later informed of the heartbreaking loss.“My neighbor had to go to the husband and tell him that his wife and two children passed away,” a local resident said.Shocking images from the aftermath showed children’s shoes scattered on the pavement, while paramedics desperately worked on the injured. A first responder was seen on his knees, visibly distraught and in tears.Three passengers inside the Uber, an adult and two children, were also taken to Kings County Hospital in stable condition. Both Yarimi and the 62-year-old Uber driver were transported to Coney Island Hospital, where they were expected to undergo tests for drink-driving.So far, no charges have been filed against Yarimi, who is a mother of one and wigmaker. She also previously won $2 million from the NYPD in a lawsuit alleging she was raped by a police officer when she was a minor, the New York Post reported.New York city mayor Eric Adams described the crash as a tragedy of “Shakespearean proportions.”“A mother going for a simple stroll on a sunny day was struck and killed,” he said at an unrelated event. “I cannot imagine the pain of the family.”","A mother and her two young daughters were killed in Brooklyn on Saturday when a driver with a suspended licence crashed into an Uber before ploughing into the family.

An American woman recently released from Taliban custody in Afghanistan expressed gratitude to US President Donald Trump for helping secure her freedom. Faye Hall , who was detained in February, appeared in a video shared by Trump on Truth Social on Saturday, where she thanked him for her safe return home.""Thank you for bringing me home,"" Hall said in the video, smiling and appearing to be in good health. She also spoke about the plight of Afghan women in Taliban jails, saying, ""All the women in the Afghan jail, they always ask me, 'When is Trump coming?' They truly treat you like their savior. They're waiting for you to come and set them free.""Hall, along with British couple Peter and Barbie Reynolds and their Afghan translator, was arrested on February 1 while traveling to Bamiyan province. The Taliban have not publicly disclosed the reasons for their detention, though reports suggest Hall was accused of unauthorised drone use.Former US envoy to Kabul Zalmay Khalilzad confirmed that Hall was in the care of the Qatari delegation in Kabul before her release. ""American citizen Faye Hall, just released by the Taliban, is now in the care of our friends, the Qataris in Kabul, and will soon be on her way home,"" Khalilzad wrote on X. According to sources, she was released on Thursday following a court order, with logistical support from Qatar .Hall's release follows a series of US citizen detentions and negotiations with the Taliban. Earlier this year, the militant group freed American George Glezmann after more than two years in captivity, in a deal brokered by Qatar. In January, two other US citizens, Ryan Corbett and William McKenty, were freed in exchange for an Afghan fighter convicted of narco-terrorism in the US.At least one American, Mahmood Habibi, remains detained in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, the British couple detained with Hall is still in Taliban custody. Their daughter has expressed concerns about her father's health and urged authorities to facilitate their release. The Reynolds, who have lived in Afghanistan since 1970, ran educational programs in the country and chose to stay even after the Taliban took over in 2021.The Taliban government remains unrecognised by the international community, though countries such as Russia, China, Turkey, and Qatar maintain diplomatic channels. Since Trump's re-election, the Taliban have expressed hopes for a ""new chapter"" in their relationship with Washington.In response to Hall's message, Trump posted, ""Thank you Faye — So honored with your words!""","Faye Hall, who was detained in February, appeared in a video shared by Trump on Saturday.

Trump said Waltz learned his lesson and the issue has been swept under the carpet.The Atlantic published a bombshell report by editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg claiming that Goldberg had been inadvertently added to a Signal group chat named ""Houthi PC Small Group"" by National Security Adviser Michael Waltz. The chat included high-ranking Trump administration officials, such as Vance, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, and others, totaling nearly 20 participants. The group was actively discussing plans for US airstrikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen, executed over the weekend of March 15-16.The White House and Pete Hegseth reiterated that no war plan was discussed in the group. Following this, the Atlantic released the full transcript of the Signal chat.A spokesman for Waltz, Brian Hughes, pushed back on suggestions that Waltz’s future remains in doubt, arguing that “the chattering of unnamed sources should be treated with the skepticism of gossip from people lacking the integrity to attach their names.” “Mike Waltz serves at the pleasure of President Trump and the president has voiced his support for Mike,” Hughes said to Politico. “The entire National Security leadership team has led a successful and effective counter terrorism mission and that is what media and Democrats are trying to obscure.”",Vice President JD Vance wanted NSA Mike Waltz to be fired for Signa chatgate.

Woman slams judges blocking Trump's deportation flights after daughter's alleged murder by illegal immigrant,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/woman-slams-judges-blocking-trumps-deportation-flights-after-daughters-alleged-murder-by-illegal-immigrant/articleshow/119724598.cms,"File photo of US President Donald Trump (Pic credit: AP)

A grieving mother whose daughter was allegedly raped and murdered by an illegal immigrant has criticised judges who have blocked US President Donald Trump's deportation flights, accusing them and their Democratic supporters of prioritising criminals over victims.Patty Morin , 64, lost her daughter, Rachel Morin , a 37-year-old mother of five, in August 2023. Rachel was found dead near a scenic trail in Maryland, and an illegal immigrant from El Salvador, 23-year-old Victor Martinez Hernandez , has been charged with her murder. His trial is set to begin with jury selection on Tuesday.Speaking to The Post, Morin expressed strong support for Trump's efforts to continue deportation flights and criticised judicial decisions that have temporarily halted them. ""It's good because I really believe that the judges are overstepping their boundaries,"" she said. ""I think that the liberal media is playing that up again, hoping the American citizens don't know or understand our laws.""Trump recently invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to deport members of Tren de Aragua, a notorious Venezuelan prison gang linked to violent crimes across the US. However, a federal district judge in Washington, DC, James Boasberg, issued a temporary restraining order blocking further deportations earlier this month. On Wednesday, the DC district court of appeals upheld the injunction, prompting the Trump administration to appeal to the Supreme Court on Friday.House Republicans have announced plans for hearings on Boasberg's ruling next week, fueling a political battle that has seen Trump call for the judge's impeachment. This has drawn criticism from Supreme Court chief justice John Roberts, who called such a response ""not appropriate.""Morin directed her frustration at former President Joe Biden and his administration's border policies, arguing that they have endangered American lives. ""They put every American citizen in harm's way, every American citizen, and especially the most vulnerable, which are women and children,"" she said.She also condemned Democratic efforts to block the deportation flights, calling them a political maneuver designed to create chaos. ""I think this is just a weak attempt by Democrats and liberals to stir up chaos and fear — which is the only thing they really know how to do,"" she said. ""It really saddens me that all these politicians choose to harbor people that have committed federal crimes.""Morin, who has previously appeared with Trump on the campaign trail as one of the so-called Angel Moms—parents who lost children due to crimes committed by illegal immigrants—emphasised the need for clear and strict enforcement of immigration laws. ""The law should be black and white. Either you break the law, or you uphold the law. There's no gray area.""Trump was first elected on a platform promising mass deportations, a policy that has gained traction even among some of his critics. A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 60% of respondents supported increasing deportations of illegal immigrants.According to Trump insiders, his legal battle over deportation flights presents a challenge for Democrats, forcing them to either support his policies or risk appearing to defend foreign criminals. ""On the one hand, this is a complex legal question,"" a Trump campaign source said. ""On the other hand, it is blindingly obvious what the right course of action is — and Americans know that.""","Patty Morin, 64, lost her daughter, Rachel Morin, a 37-year-old mother of five, in August 2023.

Yet, a glimmer of hope emerged this week for some when Rana Sanaullah, a senior adviser to PM Shehbaz Sharif, suggested that the cutoff might be reconsidered -- a rare hint of flexibility amid unrelenting pressure.The Afghan embassy in Islamabad has slammed Pakistan, accusing it of using arrests and harassment to drive out all Afghans, not just the undocumented.Pakistan’s foreign ministry fired back, insisting its actions target only illegal migrants.

Pakistani YouTube star Rajab Butt has been charged with blasphemy following the launch of his perfume named ""295"", a reference to Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws.The case was filed after his video promoting the fragrance sparked outrage, particularly from the hardline Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), which places blasphemy at the core of its political agenda.Butt, who boasts millions of followers online, announced the perfume in a now-deleted video, referencing Section 295 of Pakistan’s penal code, which deals with blasphemy. The move triggered widespread condemnation, with TLP leader Haider Ali Shah Gillani filing a formal complaint against him on Monday.""There are numerous sections in the penal code, but why did he choose blasphemy-related sections to name a perfume?"" Gillani was quoted by the news agency AFP, accusing Butt of attempting to ""normalise"" disrespect towards religious laws.According to AFP, the police charge sheet confirms that Butt has been charged under both blasphemy and cybercrime laws. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison.As the controversy increased, Butt released an apology video on Sunday, holding a Quran as he sought forgiveness. ""I apologise for the words I uttered during the launch of the perfume,"" he said. He also announced the immediate discontinuation of the product.The controversy also relates to the late Indian rapper Sidhu Moose Wala ’s song ""295,"" which also referenced blasphemy laws. Butt had previously likened himself to Moose Wala, claiming they both faced persecution under similar legal provisions, according to Daily Pakistan.This is not Butt’s first legal battle. In January, he pleaded guilty to illegally owning a lion cub, which he had received as a wedding gift.A Pakistani court ordered him to create 12 educational videos on animal welfare as part of his punishment. He avoided jail time by pledging to use his platform to raise awareness about responsible treatment of wild animals.Blasphemy remains an extremely sensitive issue in Pakistan, where accusations, often unverified, can lead to mob violence and even killings.The legal provisions under Section 295 have been widely criticised by human rights groups for being used as a tool to target individuals, including religious minorities and public figures.","Pakistani YouTube star Rajab Butt has been charged with blasphemy following the launch of his perfume named ""295,"" a reference to Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws.

QUETTA: The Balochistan government , under the leadership of chief minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti , has decided to take stringent measures against government employees involved in anti-state activities , as reported by ARY News.In a high-level meeting chaired by CM Bugti, which was attended by the IG Balochistan and the chief secretary, the government announced that it would target individuals involved in anti-state propaganda and activism.According to ARY News, CM Bugti instructed all commissioners and district officers to act swiftly against any government employees suspected of promoting anti-state narratives or participating in activities that challenge the state's authority. The government's move appears to be a direct attempt to suppress activism and dissent within the province, especially among those critical of the state's policies. Bugti also confirmed that individuals involved in such actions would be placed under strict surveillance by being added to the Fourth Schedule for closer monitoring.ARY News also reported that CM Bugti directed all heads of educational institutions in the province to ensure the national flag is hoisted and the national anthem is recited regularly. Educational leaders who fail to enforce these directives are being told to resign, which signals a heightened crackdown on any form of resistance within these spaces.This renewed focus on stifling activism in Balochistan reflects the government's broader strategy to assert control over the region, including monitoring and potentially silencing any opposition to its policies.This comes amidst the detention of Baloch leaders and activists. Activists in the Balochistan region have frequently organised protests and campaigns, calling attention to the region's marginalisation.In response, governments have implemented harsh crackdowns, often leading to the detention of Baloch leaders and activists. These actions have sparked widespread criticism from international human rights organisations, highlighting concerns over the suppression of political expression and the stifling of peaceful advocacy for regional rights.","The Balochistan government has decided to take stringent measures against government employees involved in anti-state activities.

Who is Mahrang Baloch?



Growing Baloch resistance



Challenging the narrative



Balochistan, a region rife with conflict, has become a powder keg as Pakistan confronts a growing insurgency and resistance movement, most recently illustrated with the hijacking of a train by the Balochistan Liberation Army.The shock attack resulted in around 60 deaths and brought to fore the boiling deep-seated tensions between the Baloch people and the Pakistani state.Following the attack, senior Pakistan ministers and army leaders held a special meeting to address the country's worsening security crisis.The Pakistan 'establishment', referring to the army, also turned its eyes towards more legitimate forms of protest.Pakistan police recently detained Mahrang Baloch , a leading human rights advocate and symbol of Baloch aspirations, igniting further unrest.Pakistan views the Baloch movement with increasing alarm, fearing the rise of separatist sentiments and challenges to its authority in the region, particularly because of Balochistan's vast area and crucial borders with hostile countries like Iran and Taliban-led Afghanistan.The arrest of nearly 150 activists, including Mahrang Baloch -- recognised by Time Magazine as one of its 100 Next Emerging Leaders -- has sparked international condemnation and raised concerns about human rights abuses and the suppression of Baloch voices in Pakistan.Pakistani authorities arrested Mahrang on Saturday under charges of terrorism, sedition, and murder after a protest in Balochistan's capital, Quetta, resulted in the deaths of three protesters.Mahrang Baloch, a medical doctor and leader of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), has been vocal about enforced disappearances and alleged extrajudicial killings in Balochistan.Her sister, Iqra Baloch, condemned her arrest, stating on social media that her visit to Hudda Jail was reminiscent of when she saw her father behind bars 18 years ago. “Back then, Mahrang was by our side. Today, she is not,” she wrote.Mahrang has been a key figure in protests against enforced disappearances. Her father, Abdul Gaffar Langove, a nationalist leader, was forcibly disappeared in 2009, and his body was found three years later in Lasbela district, according to BBC.Since then, she took the decision to fight against enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings. Now, the 32-year-old is continuing activism despite odds thrown at her, which include death threats, travel bans, detention etc.In December 2023, she helped organise a major march to Islamabad calling for action against enforced disappearances, which was met with police crackdowns.Mahrang's family has also alleged that authorities have denied them permission to meet her in jail or deliver food.Support for the Baloch resistance, both violent and non-violent, has been growing, especially among the youth.Many have been radicalised by ongoing human rights abuses in Balochistan, where an anti-insurgency crackdown — dubbed Pakistan's ""secret dirty war"" — has led to thousands of enforced disappearances and killings over two decades.Voice for Baloch Missing Persons reports that since 2009, around 1,500 missing individuals have been found dead, often brutally tortured, while 6,000 remain missing.Human rights groups say extrajudicial killings are rising, but the military denies involvement.Faith in political solutions has also eroded after allegations of military interference in the 2018 and 2024 elections, which sidelined popular Baloch nationalist leaders.Pakistan has been battling a separatist insurgency in Balochistan for years, with militant groups targeting security forces and foreign nationals.Authorities have often pointed towards the terror activities of the BLA to justify brutal crackdown, arrests and torture of Baloch residents.A major part of the Maharang's movement, however, is based on peaceful advocacy, which observers say presents a challenge to the state's narrative.The province, which is also the poorest, accounts for the lion's share of Pakistan’s total landmass but only 6% of its population, has been a site of insurgency and heavy military presence for decades.Activists claim that Islamabad suppresses political voices while exploiting the region's natural resources.Human rights groups argue that her arrest is part of a broader crackdown on Baloch activists. Protests, often led by women, continue in various parts of Balochistan demanding her release.The Pakistani government has not yet responded to calls for transparency regarding the charges against her.The arrest of Mahrang Baloch has scaled-up scrutiny of Pakistan’s policies in Balochistan, with rights groups calling for an independent investigation into the recent protests and the treatment of activists in the region.","Mahrang Baloch, a medical doctor and leader of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), has been vocal about enforced disappearances and alleged extrajudicial killings in Balochistan.
