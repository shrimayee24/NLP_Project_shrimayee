Dhankhar’s resignation sparks buzz: Opposition not on same page? Priyanka Chaturvedi ‘fact checks’ Jairam Ramesh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dhankhars-resignation-sparks-buzz-oppositionn-not-on-same-page-priyanka-chaturvedi-fact-checks-jairam-ramesh/articleshow/122826889.cms,"NEW DELHI: Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar’s sudden resignation late Monday has sparked a wave of speculation and political reactions. A notable disagreement has emerged within the opposition ranks regarding his tenure and abrupt exit. Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi early Tuesday took aim at attempts to paint Dhankhar’s tenure as balanced, pushing back against Congress leader Jairam Ramesh’s defence of the outgoing Rajya Sabha Chairman.Without naming Ramesh directly, Chaturvedi quoted the Congress general secretary's claim that he “took both the Government and the Opposition to task in equal measure” and dismissed it as false, reminding critics that the Opposition had once been compelled to bring a no-confidence motion against him.Ramesh, reacting to Dhankhar’s sudden resignation on Monday evening, described the move as “shocking” and “inexplicable”. He said, “Mr. Dhankar took both the Government and the Opposition to task in equal measure.”However, on early Tuesday, Chaturvedi quickly contradicted that claim with a sharp rebuttal on social media. “Fact check: Incorrect. Reminder: Opposition was forced to file a no confidence motion against the chair because of the partisan manner of conduct.Let’s at least not forget that, just because, the moment has come as a surprise,” she posted.Ramesh, meanwhile, has suggested that Dhankhar’s resignation involved more than just health concerns. In two detailed statements across Monday evening and Tuesday morning, Ramesh recounted events that he believed pointed to deeper tensions.He highlighted how Dhankhar had chaired the Business Advisory Committee (BAC) at 12:30 PM on Monday, where most members, including JP Nadda and Kiren Rijiju, were present. A follow-up meeting was scheduled for 4:30 PM but both Nadda and Rijiju failed to attend without informing Dhankhar personally. “Rightly he took umbrage and rescheduled the BAC for today at 1 PM,” Ramesh said.He added, “So something very serious happened yesterday between 1 PM and 4:30 PM to account for the deliberate absence.” While stating that the health reasons cited by Dhankhar must be respected, Ramesh noted, “It is also a fact that there are far deeper reasons for his resignation.”Ramesh praised Dhankhar for speaking up “fearlessly” on issues such as farmers’ welfare and judicial accountability and for trying, “to the extent possible under the current G2 ruling regime,” to accommodate the opposition. “Shri Jagdeep Dhankar’s resignation speaks highly of him. It also speaks poorly of those who had got him elected as Vice President in the first instance,” he concluded.Dhankhar, 74, had undergone angioplasty recently and had served as Vice President since August 2022.

The committee decided to reconvene at 4:30 PM the same day.“At 4:30 PM, the BAC reassembled under the chairmanship of Shri Jagdeep Dhankar. It waited for Shri Nadda and Shri Rijiju to arrive. They never came. Shri Jagdeep Dhankar was not personally informed that the two senior Ministers were not attending. Rightly he took umbrage and rescheduled the BAC for today at 1 PM,” Ramesh said.He added, “So something very serious happened yesterday between 1 PM and 4:30 PM to account for the deliberate absence of Shri Nadda and Shri Rijiju.”Describing Dhankhar’s resignation as “unprecedented,” Ramesh said that while his stated reason of health must be respected, there were “far deeper reasons” behind the decision. He praised Dhankhar for speaking “fearlessly for the welfare of farmers,” criticising what he termed “ahankar” in public life, and for demanding judicial accountability.“He was a stickler for norms, proprieties, and protocol, which he believed were being consistently disregarded in both his capacities,” Ramesh said, adding, “Shri Jagdeep Dhankar's resignation speaks highly of him. It also speaks poorly of those who had got him elected as Vice President in the first instance.”Dhankhar's resignation came shortly after he addressed the Rajya Sabha, confirming receipt of a motion seeking the removal of a high court judge. He also disclosed that a bundle of Rs 500 notes was found on a seat in the House, which no one had claimed — an incident he described as ""deeply concerning.""Earlier this month, addressing a gathering at Jawahar Lal University Dhankhar said, ""I will retire at the right time, August 2027, subject to divine intervention."" His departure has triggered a flurry of political reactions, with senior advocate and MP Kapil Sibal expressing personal sorrow over the development and recalling their longstanding camaraderie.Responding to Jairam Ramesh’s Monday remarks, BJP MP Nishikant Dubey took to X and said, “In films, Kader Khan used to play such roles — and now the Opposition is living out that character.”Dubey cited a Reuters report from December, which said, “Indian opposition parties moved on Tuesday to impeach Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar, a spokesman said, accusing him of being partisan in his role as chairman of parliament's upper house, in a first such move in the country's history. Dhankhar's office did not respond to a request for comment.”He added, “They had just moved a proposal to remove him. At the very least, have some concern for the man’s health.”","Congress MP Jairam Ramesh raises questions citing ""far deeper reasons"" over Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar’s sudden resignation.

"2006 Mumbai train blasts: Torture of accused barbaric, inhuman, says HC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2006-mumbai-train-blasts-torture-of-accused-barbaric-inhuman-says-hc/articleshow/122823079.cms,"In this July 11, 2006 file photo, a train coach is damaged by a bomb blast at Matunga railway station in Mumbai. (PTI)

Six minutes of terror

MUMBAI: Bombay HC termed the “torture” of accused number 1 in the train blasts case as “barbaric and inhuman” and, saying that complaints of many other accused also raised doubts that torture was inflicted, discarded the confessions obtained by the state Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) as “unreliable and inadmissible. ”The HC in its judgment elaborated on the complaints of torture by police to extract confessional statements from the accused. The alleged methods included splitting legs 180 degrees wide, tying individuals to a chair all night, denying food from morning to evening, and putting cockroaches in vests and rats in underwear amid a lot of beating.Justices Anil Kilor and Shyam Chandak, while acquitting all the dozen accused, invoked two-century-old history to invalidate confessions eked from threats, saying, “We can get the evidence of police atrocities from 1817… the passing of Bengal Police Regulation, 1817, is the example. This shows that for more than two centuries, the safeguards and checks are tried to be placed on malpractices of police officers. ”The defence argued that though the accused were in custody for over 60 days, police complained of non-cooperation. However, once MCOCA was invoked on Sept 24, 2006, 11 confessions poured in, showing they “are not voluntary but the result of continuous torture in police custody.”On Oct 9, 2006, when produced in court, all retracted the confessions and detailed the torture inflicted by ATS, defence counsel Yug Chaudhri argued.They also stepped in as defence witnesses, and their evidence merits acceptance, the HC held, since the cross-examination failed to dislodge their claim, which was “corroborated by medical and other evidence” to a “very substantial degree.”The HC said, “Not allowing a person to sleep, making him stand the whole night with his arms tied above his head, or stretching his legs to 180 degrees, as has been repeatedly testified to by the accused, will not leave visible scars on the body, no matter how much this may bruise the mind or injure the psyche.”While accused number 1, Kamal Ansari, who died in 2021 in prison, did not testify as a witness, HC noted his complaint in detail, alleging a DCP had said, “I won’t kill you, I have a pen, with this pen, I will make your life hell, your entire family will come on the road.” The high court said such detailed third-degree methods can’t be an “afterthought” as argued by the prosecution.Medical and ocular evidence “not only corroborates the complaint of A.1 of torture and its truthfulness but also the fact that police warned him not to disclose about the torture meted out to him by them to the doctor.”“The torture was barbaric and inhuman, and it exposes the frustration the officers might have had at the relevant time for obvious reasons,” said the HC, holding his confession can’t form the basis of convictions. The HC also came to a similar conclusion of torture being inflicted on many other accused.For instance, in the case of accused number 5, the HC said “evidence sufficiently hints at the possibility of torture being inflicted… to extort his confession.”The HC also said, “Detailed narration of torture with all the specific details creates doubt about torture to extort confession.”The judgment devoted 350-odd pages to confessions and about 100 pages to complaints of torture. The HC also said the prior approval to invoke MCOCA by an additional police commissioner was vitiated on grounds of complete non-application of mind by the then additional police commissioner.“The procedure(s) of sanction provided in the legislation are meant to be followed strictly, to the letter, more so to the spirit. Even the slightest of variation from the written word may render the proceedings arising therefrom to be cast in doubt,” the HC noted.","Bombay HC termed the “torture” of accused number 1 in the train blasts case as “barbaric and inhuman” The alleged methods included splitting legs 180 degrees wide, tying individuals to a chair all night, denying food from morning to evening, and putting cockroaches in vests.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122823196,imgsize-160258,width-400,resizemode-4/122823196.jpg"

If a lawyer is involved in crime, law will take its own course: CJI

NEW DELHI: Admitting that ED erred in summoning senior advocates Arvind Datar and Pratap Venugopal for rendering legal opinions to clients in a laundering case, attorney general R Venkataramani Monday told Supreme Court that all probe agencies have been asked not to commit this mistake in future.“We’ll frame guidelines in this regard,” AG told a bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran while it was hearing a suo motu case regarding the summons, which were later withdrawn.“ED officers are crossing all limits. They must know that under law, communication between a lawyer and his client is a privileged communication,” Gavai said.However, if a lawyer is involved in a crime, law will take its own course,” CJI Gavai said. SC would take up petitions filed by various bar associations on July 29 to attempt to lay down comprehensive guidelines in this regard, he added.On the joint pleas of SCBA president Vikas Singh, SC Advocates-on-Record president Vipin Nair, senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi and Vijay Hansaria, the CJI-led bench said it would frame guidelines for agencies and bar them from summoning advocates for legal opinion or advice rendered to clients facing prosecution.While agreeing with AG, solicitor general Tushar Mehta pointed out another malady afflicting some in the legal professions. ""It is equally wrong on the part of advocates, who appear for or advise a client, to create a planned narrative in favour of their client and against the probe agency through social media before and after filing of a petition in a court. Lawyers must stick to their duty of presenting the case before the court,” he said.Mehta said, ""The communication between a lawyer and his client is no doubt privileged and which must be immune from investigation, But would a lawyer's action in creating a narrative for his client outside the court also enjoy the status of a privileged communication? Would it not amount to an attempt to influence the public and judiciary about a case?”CJI Gavai asked, “Have you ever found a judgment or order of a court getting swayed or influenced by such narratives spun by lawyers outside the court? We go by facts and submissions in the courtroom and do not even watch or read what the lawyers speak outside the courtroom about the case.”Mehta said the issuance of summons to Datar was brought to the notice of the ‘highest executive’ and within six hours a circular was issued by the ED barring its officers from issuing summons to any advocate. Singh, Nair and Hansaria said issuance of summons to advocates by probe agencies would have a chilling effect on the independence of the legal profession.",ED erred in summoning senior advocates Arvind Datar and Pratap Venugopal for rendering legal opinions to clients in a laundering case.

MUMBAI: In a 1,839-page judgment, now overturned by Bombay HC, the special MCOCA court in 2015 had rejected the defence’s claim that Indian Mujahideen (IM) was responsible for the 11/7 Mumbai train bombings.On Sept 30, 2015, five alleged bomb planters had been sentenced to death and seven others handed life sentences. Special judge Yatin Shinde, since deceased, had said that police officials who initially entertained this theory, particularly after the “confession” of alleged IM member Sadiq Shaikh, “fell prey to the tactics or strategy of terrorist organisations to confuse the investigating agency”. The judge attempted to dismantle the defence’s argument, pointing out that the alleged modus operandi of IM — sending emails before blasts and claiming responsibility — was not observed in the train attacks.The judge refuted defence arguments that the convicts were merely “foot soldiers” acting at the behest of mastermind Azam Cheema. The judge observed, “The 12 are not foot soldiers. Though the idea of the present crime generated from across the border, they formed an independent organised crime syndicate on the basis of their background of being members and activists of banned organisation SIMI. They did spadework and groundwork using their brains.The eleven confession statements, now deemed inadmissible by HC, found mention in over 200 pages of the 2015 judgment. The judge had rejected claims of torture and ill-treatment made by several accused. The judge said allegations of “inhuman and unbearable” torture by ATS were unsubstantiated by the available evidence. “It is unacceptable and impossible that the accused, who were duly represented by their advocates and who had been meeting their family members, did not complain even on a single occasion to magistrates,” the judge said.The judge had awarded the death sentence to five convicts, identifying them as the most culpable due to their direct role in planting the bombs. “The accused thought that they can outsmart the intelligence and investigating agencies and therefore developed new stories every time and adopted various tactics. I am, therefore, constrained to hold that...deserve only death penalty and nothing less than that,” the judge had said.While all 12 were found guilty of offences punishable by death, the judge deemed it unjustifiable to impose the maximum penalty on seven, who were sentenced to life in prison. “One cannot say with certainty that the remaining seven accused would have taken the last step of pulling the trigger — planting the bomb — or would have backed out,” the judge stated.The judge emphasised that the option of sentencing the five bomb planters to life imprisonment was ruled out by “the simple fact of the massacre of human beings”.“These are not simple murders and this is not a simple murder case. It was mindless, cold-blooded and wanton killing of innocent, defenceless and unsuspecting persons,” the judge asserted. noted that the prosecution rightly described the accused as “merchants of death”.Rubbishing the defence, the court held it was not up to it to decide whether a person acted according to religion or not. “It is a question in these modern days as to how many Muslims, or for that matter Hindus or persons of any religion, follow their religion scrupulously. If they would have followed religion scrupulously, there would not have been crimes of murder, rape and blasts, etc.”","Bombay HC has overturned a 1,839-page judgment on the 11/7 Mumbai train bombings. The judge had rejected the defence’s claim that Indian Mujahideen (IM) was responsible for the attacks. On Sept 30, 2015, five alleged bomb planters had been sentenced to death and seven others handed life sentences.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122823374,imgsize-2713318,width-400,resizemode-4/122823374.jpg"

MUMBAI: Shock, anger and a sense of futility overcame the families of those who were killed or injured in the 11/7 serial train blasts. Monday’s acquittal of all 12 accused prompted them to ask who actually perpetrated the crime, with some remarking sarcastically, “No one did it!”Decades of fruitlessness have sealed the lips of Priti Sawant, whose husband, Parag (36), became the face of the tragedy. Parag died in 2015 after a long spell in coma. Priti is currently employed with Western Railway at Bhayander station but declined comment to TOI, saying she did not wish to relive the trauma. She was an expectant mother in 2006, and her daughter was born after Parag’s injury.Harshal Bhalerao (23) of Vasai was killed in the blast. His mother Saguna said Monday, “No verdict will bring my son back. But the guilty must be punished.” Harshal’s father, Yashwant, said, “Not a single victim’s family will like this judgment. We have named our bungalow ‘Harshal 11/7’ after him. He was our only boy, now our daughter takes care of us.” Harshal was on his first day of work in Andheri when he fell victim at Borivli.Artist Mahendra Pitale lost an arm. He said, “The order is a massive shock. Is it going to take law enforcement agencies another 19 years to find the real perpetrators?”Pitale too was given a job by railways.“My prosthetic limb is very expensive and I have to find sponsors or depend on trusts to be able to afford it,” said Pitale, who has changed prosthetic limbs seven times in the past two decades.“No one killed 200 people & injured 700...,” tweeted chartered accountant Chirag Chauhan, who had suffered a spinal injury that left his legs and lower body paralysed.Vishakha Seksaria, sister of Vrindesh, who was killed, said, “I am unable to digest this news.” Subhash Saboo said, “I can never forget that day as my father (Nathmal) was on the train towards Malad and he never made it home.”Rishi Bobra (38), who spent a month in the ICU, said he had nothing to say on the verdict and had moved ahead.Garden landscaper Harish Pawar was injured when a train rod pierced his chest. He bubbled over in anger on Monday. “Why was the evidence that was deemed acceptable by the lower courts for conviction, entirely negated by HC?”Vasai resident Raniya D’Souza lost her father, Manuel (36), when she was just six and a half. Manuel, a chemical engineer and the sole breadwinner, was killed in the Matunga blast. Raniya is grateful to Western Railway for having granted her a job after graduation. Her younger brother, who was only two and a half at the time, does not have any memories of their father.Hansraj Kanojia, who lost a leg, demanded reinvestigation. “If they are being set free today and go on to commit the same crime again, who will take responsibility?

HC went through 44,000 pages of record

MUMBAI: Bombay HC Monday ripped apart the trustworthiness of the prosecution’s witnesses in the 11/7 train blasts case and held that the special executive officer (SEO) who conducted the test identification parade — a primary step following the arrest of an accused — lacked the authority to do so.The parade of various accused was conducted by two SEOs, one of whom ceased to hold the post in 2005. High court said the prosecution failed to bring any evidence on record to show that he continued to be the SEO when the test identification parade was conducted by him on Nov 7, 2006. Hence, the identification of three accused—all alleged planters—stands vitiated and is discarded, it stated.However, prosecution witnesses can identify accused in court during the trial, but HC found such identification lacked the credibility it needed.HC said the first of six categories of eyewitnesses produced by the prosecution against the accused were two taxi drivers who took two accused, both alleged planters, to Churchgate station; they identified the accused. A total of eight witnesses identified the accused in test identification parades and also in court. Apart from the two taxi drivers, four claimed to have seen the accused planting the bombs in the trains.The seventh one claimed that he saw the accused preparing bombs, and the eighth said he saw the hatching of the conspiracy and identified the accused in court. One witness claimed to have seen the suspects after they alighted from the train. His statement helped in creating two sketches, but he was not asked to identify the accused in court, HC noted.After more than six months of hearing in the 2006 serial train blasts case, and going through more than 44,000 pages of record, Bombay HC concluded that Maharashtra Anti-Terror Squad (ATS) had no case. It said the prosecution failed to prove what kind of explosive was used: no importance could be attached to the claims of recovery of RDX, circuit boards and detonators, as prosecution failed to prove custody chain before analysis.In a detailed analysis of the case and evidence on record, Bombay HC said while the “prosecution has referred to al-Qaida Manual for many things, nothing is brought on record about it”.Over two decades ago, bombs planted on first-class compartments exploded during peak evening commute at seven locations on Western Railway suburban network. They ripped apart metal bogies and lives between Khar Road and Santacruz, Bandra and Khar, Jogeshwari and Mahim Junction, Mira Road and Bhayander, Matunga and Mahim Junction, and Borivli.The prosecution case was of sophisticated explosive RDX being used, of accused being members of terror outfits like SIMI who received training in Pakistan, and of 15 wanted accused, mainly Pakistanis. While the trial court’s special MCOCA judge, Y D Shinde, in 2015 said special public prosecutor Raja Thakare had rightly described the accused as “merchants of death” and Thakare argued that the trial verdict could not be dislodged and the noose be confirmed, the HC noted the prosecution case had unravelled completely.The dozen men were in prison all along since their arrests in 2006. While one of them died after the Covid pandemic in 2021, the 11 whose appeals were allowed joined on Monday via video-conferencing from prisons across the state, including Pune’s Yerawada and the prisons in Nashik, Amravati and Nagpur.An alleged planter, Naved Khan, from Nagpur prison, told court he suffered “needlessly for 19 years” and while lives were lost, innocents could not be hanged either.","HC went through 44,000 pages of record and concluded that Maharashtra Anti- Terror Squad (ATS) had no case.

FAQs

1.Who is Richard Tillman?

2.Why is Richard Tillman in the news?

3.Is mental illness involved in his case?

Before Richard Tillman crashed into a San Jose post office and allegedly set it ablaze, his mind had been unraveling in front of the internet. The 44-year-old brother of NFL hero Pat Tillman had battled severe mental illness for years, according to his family. Despite visible distress and repeated cries for help, they say the mental health system failed him. His arrest is making headlines — but to those close to him, it’s the result of years of untreated suffering.For months, Richard had been posting increasingly erratic videos, calling himself “Yeshua” and claiming divine powers. He would livestream hours of delusional monologues, often appearing agitated, paranoid, and deeply disconnected from reality. His family watched in fear, knowing the content reflected more than eccentricity — it revealed mental collapse in public view. “We all saw it coming, but we couldn’t get him real help,” a family source told NBC Bay Area.Kevin Tillman, Richard’s brother, spoke out about the emotional toll and the system’s inaction. “He has been battling severe mental health issues for many years,” Kevin said in a public statement. “Unfortunately, securing the proper care and support for him has proven incredibly difficult — or rather, impossible.He has been livestreaming, what I’ll call, his altered self on social media for anyone to witness,” he added.Authorities say Richard drove into the post office around 3 a.m. and started a fire, but no one was injured. He was arrested and is being held at Santa Clara County Jail, facing arson charges and awaiting arraignment. For Kevin, the bigger issue isn’t the fire — it’s what led up to it: a neglected mental health emergency. “As a result, none of this is as shocking as it should be,” he said, summing up years of ignored warning signs.Richard’s downward spiral wasn’t hidden — it played out live to anyone who would watch, including law enforcement. He previously had run-ins with police, restraining orders, and DUIs — all possible signs of deeper psychological decline. Despite this pattern, the family says the mental health system put up barriers at every step of the way.

The brothers then entered the house, to find no one in there.""But they got suspicious on seeing new floor tiles in one corner,"" said an officer.A few neighbours were called.

JAIPUR: The brutal murder of a 22-year-old man in Paldi Meena suburb, around 10 km from Jaipur, escalated into widespread protests and unrest, disrupting traffic movement for hours on Jaipur-Agra national highway Monday.The victim, Vipin Kumar, was stabbed around 14 times, allegedly by Mohammad Anas and his associates, late Sunday night in full public view, police said.The protest was finally withdrawn Monday evening after the family's demands for financial compensation, job guarantee and speedy justice were accepted by the administration.Anas, described by police as a ""history-sheeter"" with over a dozen criminal cases against him in Jaipur Commissionerate's Jamdoli police station, allegedly posted on social media claiming ""revenge"" after the attack.The murder sparked outrage, with large crowds gathering Monday morning to protest the killing. Demonstrators attempted multiple road blockades on the national highway, while some protesters targeted and damaged shops allegedly belonging to members of a particular community.Police took swift action and detained accused Mohammad Anas and his five accomplices in the afternoon. During the arrest, Anas allegedly attempted to seize an ASI's service pistol, forcing the police to shoot him in the leg.He was subsequently taken to a hospital for treatment under police custody.DCP (East) Tejaswani Gautam said the motive behind the murder remains under investigation. However, local sources pointed to an ongoing dispute between the victim and the accused spanning two years, despite previous attempts at mediation.Enraged residents claimed Anas had previously threatened multiple families in the area, including Kumar's. ""Anas had been arrested before. Police even paraded him in public, but he only grew bolder,"" said Sunil Khatik, a local resident.The victim's family demanded compensation, including employment guarantee and financial assistance, as they refused to proceed with the postmortem until their demands were met.As family members and locals demanded immediate justice, unrest spread, leading to repeated attempts at blocking traffic on the national highway. Police efforts to control the situation resulted in sporadic clashes, with some demonstrators damaging nearby shops before being pushed back.By the evening, while the size of the agitating crowd diminished, the local community remained insistent on compensation, including a job and financial support for Kumar's family, and the execution of the accused.A large police force, including Rapid Action Force (RAF) and Quick Response Teams (QRT), was deployed throughout the area.The roots of the conflict reportedly trace back two years to an incident involving a goat belonging to Kumar’s family.One sister recalled that the tension began two years ago, when Kumar’s goat strayed into Anas’s lane. Friends of Kumar said a possible dispute over a girl may have played a role. Police said this claim surfaced during early questioning but was unconfirmed.","Vipin Kumar, 22, was stabbed 14 times, allegedly by Mohammad Anas and his associates.

GURGAON: A 16-year-old boy was apprehended for the alleged murder of his seven-year-old neighbour, stabbing him nearly 20 times with scissors before hiding the body behind bushes near KMP Expressway.According to police, the murder was the fallout of an incident two months ago when the victim spotted the accused with his father's stolen phone. The matter escalated when the younger boy's father confronted the teen's family, leading to a public apology and the 16-year-old being beaten up by his father in front of others. This episode, police said, left him seething with revenge.Although the two children continued to play together after the incident a couple of months, the accused was allegedly plotting his revenge. The opportunity came on Saturday when the victim stepped out to play after completing his homework. The teen allegedly lured the younger boy away from the residential area and launched a savage attack on him near the expressway, repeatedly stabbing him in the chest and stomach.""I had told my son not to play with him, but he was a kid. Neither did I think that such an incident could ever happen,"" said the victim's father, who works as a courier delivery partner in the city.The victim's mother, who had left him in his father's care before heading to work, grew worried when he didn't return home by his usual time of 8-8.30pm. After hours of searching, she filed a missing person's report late on Saturday night. The body was discovered the next morning in the green belt area near Kalwadi village.""After retrieving the phone, the boy and his father had to apologise to the victim's family. Harbouring resentment, the minor lured the boy away from home and stabbed him 18-20 times with scissors, leading to his death,"" a police officer said.The case unfolded rapidly as police questioned the victim's friends and zeroed in on the accused, who confessed to the crime during questioning. The accused will be presented in a juvenile court on Monday.The boy's father said he could never imagine that a seemingly minor incident would snowball into a murder this ghastly. ""Two months ago, my son told me he saw him with my stolen mobile phone. I told him it might be a different phone, but he kept insisting it was the same,"" the father recalled. The truth emerged when other children playing with the same phone revealed they had received it from the accused.""I called his parents to my house and narrated the whole incident. Both the father and son apologised. In anger, his father started beating him up, but I stopped him,"" he added.","A 16-year-old boy has been apprehended for the alleged murder of his seven- year-old neighbour.

Heroin smuggling from Punjab tightens grip on Chamba as police crack down on rising drug menace,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/heroin-smuggling-from-punjab-tightens-grip-on-chamba-as-police-crack-down-on-rising-drug-menace/articleshow/122826668.cms,"



CHAMBA: The growing menace of heroin smuggling from Punjab is tightening its grip on Himachal Pradesh’s (HP) remote hill districts, with Chamba emerging as a new hotspot for narcotics distribution.In a recent breakthrough, Chamba police arrested two brothers from Amritsar who were allegedly supplying heroin (also known as chitta) in the Dalhousie region, even as there is a lack of data to ascertain the gravity of the situation. The suspects, identified as Arjander and Pawan , residents of Amritsar, were apprehended during a patrol operation near Dalhousie.Police recovered a substantial quantity of chitta from their possession, suspected to be intended for local sale. Investigators are now probing how much heroin the duo may have already sold in the area and mapping their network of suppliers and buyers.Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Chamba, Abhishek Yadav, confirmed the arrests and raised alarm over the growing trend of drug smuggling from border areas of Punjab—particularly from Amritsar and Pathankot—into Chamba district. “There has been a noticeable increase in narcotics-related cases in recent months,” SSP Yadav said addign that police were actively pursuing every lead and taking strict action against those involved in the smuggling and distribution of heroin and other substances.Yadav said police had laid naka at Punjab-HP border at Tanu Hatti. Despite these efforts, traffickers continue to exploit forested routes and slip past the checkpoints. According to police sources, heroin is often brought across the border in small, concealed quantities via taxis, motorcycles by drug smuggles who pose as tourists or businessmen supplying commodities in Chamba district and often travel either single or in group of two.Keshav Verma, President of the Vishva Hindu Parishad, HP, expressed grave concern over the escalating crisis. “The Chamba-Punjab border has become a notorious route for heroin smuggling, particularly from Amritsar,” Verma said. “Families are desperate. Parents come to us for help begging the police to take their addicted children into custody just to keep them away from drugs.”Verma also urged the district administration to publish official data on drug addiction cases in the region. “We need a transparent baseline to form a targeted strategy and ensure effective enforcement at the borders.”Dr Neeraj, Head of Department of Psychiatry, Chamba Medical Colleges, confirmed that in the recent past, the number of drug addict patients coming for treatment has increased. “Drug addiction is slowly on the rise in Chamba,” he said.","Heroin smuggling from Punjab is tightening its grip on Himachal Pradesh’s (HP) remote hill districts.

"Houston horror: Chinese woman lured with fake job offer, trafficked and raped; Honduran migrant arrested for holding her captive",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/houston-horror-chinese-woman-lured-with-fake-job-offer-trafficked-and-raped-honduran-migrant-arrested-for-holding-her-captive/articleshow/122826272.cms,"



A 22-year-old illegal migrant from Honduras has been charged with aggravated kidnapping after allegedly holding a Chinese woman captive for five days, during which he repeatedly assaulted her and deprived her of food and water.Jose Carcamo was arrested on 14 July after police responded to a distress call about a woman screaming for help in East Houston. Doorbell camera footage reportedly shows Carcamo snatching the woman off the street and carrying her away as she struggled to escape, New York Post reported.According to court documents, Carcamo locked the woman in a room inside a trailer home, where she was tied up, beaten and sexually assaulted multiple times. She had no access to food or water throughout the ordeal.The woman, believed to be a victim of a human trafficking network, told investigators she had travelled from New York to Houston after being promised a better-paying job as a masseuse. Once she arrived, her passport was taken from her and she was confined to the trailer.Lieutenant John Klafka, head of the Harris County Sheriff’s adult special crimes unit, said the woman had spent several days travelling by car from New York.""She said she was a masseuse up in New York. She was offered a position down here in Houston that paid more money. So she was given transportation down here,"" Klafka told local media.The situation turned violent when she tried to flee, prompting Carcamo to allegedly lock her in a closet, where she was eventually discovered by deputies.A witness had earlier reported seeing her running down the street before being forcibly taken back.“This is a very traumatic event. You know, you’re in a foreign country. You were brought from one giant city to another that’s halfway across the country, south. And she has no friends, no family. Nobody is here for her. So we’ve got to do everything we can to ensure that she can trust us to do our jobs and find the rest of the people that are involved in this,” said Klafka.Authorities believe this case is connected to a broader trafficking network operating across state lines, and investigations are ongoing to identify other victims and suspects.","Jose Carcamo, 22, charged with aggravated kidnapping after allegedly holding a Chinese woman captive for five days.

2016 elections probe: Trump accuses Obama of Russia ‘hoax’; calls it ‘crime of the century’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/2016-elections-probe-trump-accuses-obama-of-russia-hoax-calls-it-crime-of-the-century/articleshow/122825361.cms,"



US President Donald Trump has launched a fresh attack against Barack Obama , accusing the former president of orchestrating the false story that Russia helped Trump win the 2016 election. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden and others were part of what he called “the crime of the century” and said there is clear proof against them.“Obama himself manufactured the Russia, Russia, Russia HOAX. Crooked Hillary, Sleepy Joe, and numerous others participated in this, THE CRIME OF THE CENTURY! Irrefutable EVIDENCE. A major threat to our Country!!!”Trump’s comments come just as the US department of justice formally received a criminal referral from former Congresswoman and director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard . The referral alleges a “treasonous conspiracy” by senior Obama-era officials to undermine Trump’s 2016 electoral victory and cast doubt over the legitimacy of the democratic process.On Friday, Gabbard made public more than 100 pages of internal documents which, she claims, show deliberate efforts by members of the Obama administration to suppress benign intelligence in the closing weeks of Obama’s presidency.“Their goal was to usurp President Trump and subvert the will of the American people,” Gabbard posted on X (formerly Twitter). “No matter how powerful, every person involved in this conspiracy must be investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.The integrity of our democratic republic depends on it.”Among the released records were assessments dating back to December 2016 from US intelligence agencies, which stated unequivocally that foreign adversaries had not altered the outcome of the presidential election via cyberattacks.“We have no evidence of cyber manipulation of election infrastructure intended to alter results,” one of the reports read, cited by the New York Post.Despite this, those findings were reportedly excluded from the Presidential Daily Brief after the FBI, then led by James Comey, expressed dissent based on what was described as “new guidance.”Just two days later, President Obama met with senior intelligence and security chiefs, including James Clapper, Andrew McCabe, and CIA Director John Brennan, in the Oval Office to discuss what would later become the cornerstone of the Trump-Russia collusion narrative.Gabbard said she has turned over all related materials to the DOJ and is urging a full-scale investigation into what she labelled the “boldest and most coordinated political deception” in modern American history.While the Department of Justice has yet to comment publicly, the explosive nature of Gabbard’s claims, paired with Trump’s renewed accusations, sets the stage for yet another high-profile political battle.","US President Donald Trump has launched a fresh attack against Barack Obama, accusing the former president of orchestrating the false story that Russia helped Trump win the 2016 election.

'Total disaster': Trump slams Obama appointed judge in Harvard case hearing; vows to appeal again if loses,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/total-disaster-trump-slams-obama-appointed-judge-in-harvard-case-hearing-vows-to-appeal-again-if-loses/articleshow/122824385.cms,"



US President Donald Trump launched an attack on a federal judge presiding over a high-stakes legal battle between his administration and Harvard University.He accused her of bias and vowed to appeal in case of an unfavourable ruling.Taking to his Truth Social platform, Trump wrote, “The Harvard case was just tried in Massachusetts before an Obama appointed Judge. She is a TOTAL DISASTER, which I say even before hearing her Ruling. She has systematically taken over the various Harvard cases, and is an automatic “loss” for the People of our Country!”He went on to claim, “Harvard has $52 Billion Dollars sitting in the Bank, and yet they are anti-Semitic, anti-Christian, and anti-America. Much of this money comes from the U.S.A., all to the detriment of other Schools, Colleges, and Institutions, and we are not going to allow this unfair situation to happen any longer.”Questioning how Judge Allison Burroughs came to oversee the matter, the US President further added, “How did this Trump-hating Judge get these cases? When she rules against us, we will IMMEDIATELY appeal, and WIN.”He also signalled a broader move to cut off federal support to the Ivy League institution, saying, “The Government will stop the practice of giving many Billions of Dollars to Harvard, much of which had been given without explanation.It is a longtime commitment to Fairness in Funding Education, and the Trump Administration will not stop until there is VICTORY.”During a two-hour hearing on Monday, Judge Burroughs seemed doubtful of the administration’s case and suggested that the IVY might prevail in the legal battle against the Trump administration. She didn’t give a ruling but questioned the government’s arguments as both sides asked for a quick decision, as per the New York Times.In the hearing that took place in a Boston court, Burroughs questioned the justice department's efforts to cut off billions in medical research funding, pressing for explanations on how such funding withdrawal decisions were linked to civil rights of Jewish people.She challenged the rationale behind the move, warning of “staggering” constitutional implications if the executive branch could penalise a university without proper process.“What I'm wrestling with is this idea that the executive branch can decide what is discriminatory or racist,” she said, “these ad hoc decisions without any procedure around it.these ad hoc decisions without any procedure around it.”Harvard sued the Trump administration two months ago, alleging that the government violated its First Amendment rights by conditioning federal funding on the university’s compliance with politically driven demands. At the centre of the dispute is whether the administration bypassed established rules in a rush to defund the school.Justice department lawyer Michael Velchik defended the administration’s stance, arguing that the government has the authority to determine where taxpayer money goes.But Harvard has rejected claims that it supports discrimination. Steven Lehotsky, representing the university, told the court the administration’s actions were a “blatant, unrepentant violation of the First Amendment.”He also pointed out the government's departure from normal procedures in its attempt to punish Harvard.Judge Burroughs also indicated that the case may hinge not only on constitutional principles but also on whether due process was followed.",US President Donald Trump launched an attack on a federal judge presiding over a high-stakes legal battle between his administration and Harvard University.

Breonna Taylor case: Ex-police officer Brett Hankison handed 33 months prison sentence; Judge rejects DOJ’s call for leniency,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/breonna-taylor-case-ex-police-officer-handed-33-months-prison-sentence-judge-rejects-dojs-call-for-leniency/articleshow/122825315.cms,"Breonna Taylor (File photo)





A federal judge dismissed a Justice Department appeal for clemency on Monday and handed down a 33-month prison term to a former officer for breaching the civil rights of a Breonna Taylor, a Black woman, whose 2020 death sparked extensive demonstrations.The Kentucky jury found Brett Hankison, a previous Louisville police detective, guilty in November of violating Taylor's civil rights during a failed police operation at her residence.Harmeet Dhillon, who leads the Justice Department's civil rights division, made an extraordinary request to Judge Rebecca Jennings last week, suggesting a sentence as time served, which is one day Hankison spent in custody upon arrest.However, Jennings, a Trump-era judicial appointee, dismissed this suggestion, expressing concern over the prosecution's sentencing document and lenient recommendations, according to the Louisville Courier Journal.The sentence included 33 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release, despite the possibility of a life sentence.The deaths of 26-year-old Taylor followed by George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man killed by a white Minneapolis officer in May 2020, catalysed substantial protests across the United States and internationally against police misconduct and racial discrimination.On March 13, 2020, around midnight, Taylor and her partner Kenneth Walker were asleep in her Louisville flat when they detected noise at the entrance. Walker discharged his firearm, wounding an officer, believing an intrusion was occurring.The police, armed with a disputed no-knock warrant for a drug arrest, responded with over 30 shots, fatally wounding Taylor.During the operation, Hankison fired 10 shots, some entering a neighbouring flat, without hitting anyone. He remains the sole officer convicted regarding the incident.In her sentencing document, Dhillon argued that a substantial prison term would be ""unjust."" ""Hankison did not shoot Ms. Taylor and is not otherwise responsible for her death,"" she said. ""Hankison did not wound her or anyone else at the scene that day, although he did discharge his duty weapon ten times blindly into Ms Taylor's home.""The Taylor family's legal representatives acknowledged that whilst the sentence didn't ""fully reflect the severity of the harm caused,"" it exceeded the Justice Department's recommendation. ""We respect the court's decision, but we will continue to call out the DOJ's failure to stand firmly behind Breonna's rights and the rights of every Black woman whose life is treated as expendable,"" they said.In May, the Justice Department withdrew lawsuits initiated under Joe Biden 's administration against Louisville and Minneapolis police forces, which had alleged excessive force and racial discrimination.","Breonna Taylor, a Black woman, was fatally shot by a police officer in 2020. Brett Hankison was found guilty in November of violating Taylor's civil rights. The Justice Department requested a sentence of time served, which is one day in custody.

Trump Gets Big Dare From Dems As Epstein Files Row Explodes | Watch





Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley on Monday released newly declassified documents related to the FBI’s investigation into Hillary Clinton ’s use of a private email server during her time as Secretary of State. The materials, according to Grassley, reveal that the FBI “failed to fully investigate” Clinton’s handling of classified information.“This document shows an extreme lack of effort and due diligence in the FBI's investigation of former Secretary Clinton's email usage and mishandling of highly classified information,"" Grassley said in a press release.""Under Comey's leadership, the FBI failed to perform fundamental investigative work and left key pieces of evidence on the cutting room floor,"" he added.Grassley further criticized the disparity between the FBI’s handling of the Clinton case and its aggressive investigation into alleged Trump-Russia ties. ""The Comey FBI's negligent approach and perhaps intentional lack of effort in the Clinton investigation is a stark contrast to its full-throated investigation of the Trump-Russia collusion hoax, which was based on the uncorroborated and now discredited Steele dossier.Comey's decision-making process smacks of political infection,"" the statement read.Clinton faced FBI scrutiny over her use of a private server to store classified emails during her tenure from 2009 to 2013 in the Obama administration. In 2016, just months before the presidential election , then-FBI Director James Comey announced that the bureau would not recommend prosecution. ""Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case,"" also said Comey. ""Prosecutors necessarily weigh a number of factors before bringing charges. There are obvious considerations, like the strength of the evidence, especially regarding intent. Responsible decisions also consider the context of a person's actions, and how similar situations have been handled in the past.""Grassley’s newly released documents stem from what is known as the “Clinton annex,” an appendix to the Department of Justice Inspector General’s 2018 review of the Clinton email investigation. The materials were declassified at Grassley’s request by Attorney General Pam Bondi and other Trump administration officials, according to Fox News.The documents reportedly show that Comey and other FBI leaders took possession of key thumb drives but failed to thoroughly examine them. According to Grassley’s office, the drives potentially contained classified content from several federal agencies- including the State Department, congressional communications, and even correspondence involving former President Barack Obama.Additional intelligence, cited in Grassley’s release, suggests possible interference in the investigation by the Obama administration. The FBI also reportedly received information indicating communication between then-Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz — who chaired the Democratic National Committee until July 2016 — and members of the Soros-founded Open Society Foundations. However, Grassley claims the bureau ""did not make serious investigative efforts"" to follow up on such leads.""I warned years ago that the Clinton investigation failed to hit the mark, and I'm grateful the American people can finally see the facts for themselves,"" Grassley said. ""After nearly a decade in the shadows, this information is now coming to light thanks to Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel's dedicated efforts to fulfill my congressional request.""""I appreciate their ongoing commitment to transparency and strongly urge them to continue to fully review this matter, including its national security impact,"" he added.This development comes just days after Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard made headlines by declassifying documents she says reveal extensive efforts by Obama-era officials to politicize intelligence on Russian interference in the 2016 election.According to Gabbard, the documents show that “overwhelming evidence” supports the claim that the Obama administration helped initiate the Trump-Russia investigation after Clinton’s defeat. ""Their goal was to usurp President Trump and subvert the will of the American people,"" Gabbard posted on X. ""No matter how powerful, every person involved in this conspiracy must be investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. The integrity of our democratic republic depends on it. We are turning over all documents to the DOJ for criminal referral.""Fox News confirmed that the Department of Justice has received the referral, but the DOJ declined to comment further.","Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley on Monday released newly declassified documents related to the FBI’s investigation into Hillary Clinton ’s use of a private email server during her time as Secretary of State.

"Secret deportation: 82-year old lost after ICE office visit to replace green card; family was told he died, later found alive in Guatemala",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/secret-deportation-82-year-old-lost-after-ice-office-visit-to-replace-green-card-family-was-told-he-died-later-found-alive-in-guatemala/articleshow/122805010.cms,"



Luis Leon, an 82-year-old Pennsylvania resident, was unexpectedly deported to Guatemala after visiting a US immigration office to replace his lost green card.Leon had been living in Allentown for decades after being granted political asylum in the US in 1987, following torture under Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet’s regime.He had lost his wallet containing the physical card that confirmed his legal residency, according to The Morning Call report cited by the Guardian. Therefore, Leonus and his wife had booked an appointment at an immigration office for 20 June to have the card replaced.However, upon arrival, Leon was suddenly handcuffed by two Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers and led away without explanation, his wife said. She was allegedly held inside the building for 10 hours before relatives came to collect her. The family said they then heard nothing about Leon’s whereabouts, despite numerous attempts to contact authorities.Days later, they received a phone call from a woman claiming to be an immigration lawyer who said she could assist, but she did not explain how she knew about the case or where Leon was being held. On 9 July, the same woman contacted the family again and told them Leon had died.However, in a shocking twist, the family learned a week later through a relative in Chile that Leon was, in fact, alive, but hospitalised in Guatemala, a country with which he has no known connection. The relative said Leon had initially been detained in an immigration facility in Minnesota before being deported, although his name did not appear on any public ICE deportation lists.His family remains in the dark about how and why he was removed to Guatemala. A recent US Supreme Court ruling had allowed the Trump-era policy permitting deportations to third countries, not just countries of origin, to stand.Leon, who had spent nearly four decades in the US working at a leather manufacturing plant and raising a family, had since retired. His medical condition remains unclear, but relatives say that he suffers from diabetes, high blood pressure and a heart condition. They now planning to travel to Guatemala to be by his side.The case is currently under investigation.","Luis Leon, 82, was granted political asylum in the US in 1987 following torture under Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet’s regime.

Bizarre jailbreak: How French prisoner escaped in released cellmate’s laundry bag; went unnoticed for 24 hours,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/bizarre-jailbreak-how-french-prisoner-escaped-in-released-cellmates-laundry-bag-went-unnoticed-for-24-hours/articleshow/122807352.cms,"AI-generated representative image





A 20-year-old inmate, Elyazid A, nicknamed ""the Joker"" or ""the Equaliser"", chose a unique way to escape from a French prison- concealed in fellow inmate's laundry bag, who was being released.The inmate serving several sentences escaped by hiding in the luggage of his inmate who complete his sentence, the Prison Service said in a statement to AFP. He ""took advantage of the liberation of his fellow inmate to hide himself in his luggage and get out,"" the statement said.However, the authorities re-apprehended him later in a village cellar last week, approximately 25km from Lyon-Corbas prison, according to Guardian News.The prison staff failed to notice his absence for 24 hours. Reports indicate he escaped by hiding in a large plastic laundry bag filled with clothes, which his released cellmate transported out on a trolley on Friday. The police continue their search for the accomplice cellmate.Multiple investigations have been launched by Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin, Lyon prosecutors, the French prison service and Lyon-Corbas facility to examine the escape circumstances.The national prison service head, Sébastien Cauwel, confirmed that Elyazid A, despite facing charges including criminal association and conspiracy to murder, was not considered a security threat. Cauwel described the escape method as exceptionally uncommon, attributing its success to significant internal failures.The incident raised questions about systemic issues within the facility, primarily stemming from staff-related shortcomings rather than infrastructure problems. The severe overcrowding exacerbates these challenges for prison officers.Lyon-Corbas prison currently houses almost 1,220 inmates despite its 678-person capacity. A May report by the Lyon bar association urged immediate action to address overcrowding and maintain basic human rights.The French prison system accommodates 85,000 inmates in facilities designed for under 63,000 people. Cauwel noted that vacant cells are immediately filled, potentially contributing to oversight failures. According to a 2024 Council of Europe assessment, French prisons rank third in EU overcrowding rates, behind Cyprus and Romania. The country has witnessed numerous dramatic escapes, including about 20 helicopter breakouts since the 1980s, reported The Guardian.The prison service faces a shortage of at least 5,000 officers. Recent incidents include armed attacks on prison facilities, with 21 arrests in April following assaults, including gunfire at Toulon prison's entrance.Drug cartels have targeted prison facilities, damaging officers' housing and burning vehicles, responding to increased government enforcement and stricter regulations for imprisoned crime leaders.","20-year-old Elyazid A, nicknamed ""the Joker"" or ""the Equaliser"", chose a unique way to escape from a French prison.

Suspect on run after stealing firetruck, causing massive amount of damage





A fire truck theft in Washington state on Friday night led to extensive damage and multiple vehicle collisions.The incident occurred when an Everett Fire Department vehicle was taken from Hoyt Avenue, situated 30 miles north of Seattle, whilst firefighters attended a medical emergency at an apartment building's fifth floor, according to the department's update on Saturday morning, quoted by NBC News.The thief drove the fire engine at high speeds through north Everett's residential areas, causing considerable damage to parked vehicles and landscaping across five locations before abandoning the vehicle. The theft was discovered after 11 pm (Local time) when the first 911 call reported a hit-and-run incident. Witnesses reported that the fire truck had struck two parked vehicles at high speed before leaving the scene.The vehicle eventually came to a halt in the 1000 block of E Marine View Drive after colliding with at least ten parked vehicles. The Everett Police Department responded to at least six locations where damage to parked cars, trees, directional signs and grass was reported. Fortunately, no injuries occurred at any of the sites.“Losing a fire engine in such a reckless manner not only jeopardizes the safety of our first responders but also puts our community at risk,” said Everett Police Chief John DeRousse said in a statement, quoted by NY Post.The 2018 Pierce Enforcer pumper truck, which retailed between Rs 4 crore and Rs 8 crore, was severely damaged and had to be taken out of service.The stolen vehicle, a 2018 Pierce Enforcer Pumper weighing approximately 35,000 pounds, sustained significant damage and has been impounded as evidence. The fire truck, one of the department's newer engines, is particularly dangerous when moving due to its substantial weight.Everett Police Chief John DeRousse said, ""Losing a fire engine to such a reckless person not only jeopardizes the safety of our first responders but also puts our community at risk. We are committed to ensuring the safety of our residents, and any information that helps us resolve this incident is crucial. It is imperative that we hold the suspect accountable for their actions, and we will work diligently to bring them to justice. ""The police are seeking public assistance with information or footage of the incident.

"FBI lapses, missed leads, and fresh interviews: Trump admin releases Martin Luther King Jr., Hillary Clinton probe files; what do they reveal?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fbi-lapses-missed-leads-and-fresh-interviews-trump-admin-releases-martin-luther-king-jr-hillary-clinton-probe-files-what-do-they-reveal/articleshow/122825353.cms,"Martin Luther King Jr and Hillary Clinton

Here are some key facts about Clinton's file



""This document shows an extreme lack of effort and due diligence in the FBI’s investigation of former Secretary Clinton’s email usage and mishandling of highly classified information,"" Grassley said in a Monday press release.

""Under Comey’s leadership, the FBI failed to perform fundamental investigative work and left key pieces of evidence on the cutting room floor. The Comey FBI’s negligent approach and perhaps intentional lack of effort in the Clinton investigation is a stark contrast to its full-throated investigation of the Trump-Russia collusion hoax, which was based on the uncorroborated and now discredited Steele dossier. Comey’s decision-making process smacks of political infection,"" he added.

The Department of Justice Office of Inspector General's Clinton addendum reveals that while the FBI acquired USB drives from an informant during their Clinton investigation, senior officials including Director James Comey, Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, Special Agent Peter Strzok and colleagues neglected to conduct specific, focused examinations of these storage devices, despite their relevance to the enquiry.

The report demonstrated that due to this oversight, the FBI's investigation of the Clinton matter was incomplete, failing to properly assess the national security implications of Clinton's negligent handling of classified materials. The DOJ OIG noted that these drives contained sensitive data extracted from various US government departments, including State Department files, correspondence from then-President Barack Obama, and possibly congressional materials. Despite a preliminary FBI memo suggesting otherwise, these storage devices never underwent proper scrutiny as part of the Clinton investigation. The DOJ OIG findings additionally indicate that whilst these drives warranted immediate analysis for potential foreign intelligence concerns, this crucial step was overlooked.

""The intelligence reports alleged that the Obama administration took efforts to scuttle the investigation into Clinton and protect her candidacy,"" Grassley's release reported.

Here are some key details from King Jr files:



“Today, after nearly 60 years of questions surrounding the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., we are releasing 230,000 MLK assassination files,” Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard wrote on X.

""The American people deserve answers decades after the horrific assassination of one of our nation’s great leaders,"" said Attorney General Pamela Bondi. ""The Department of Justice is proud to partner with Director Gabbard and the ODNI at President Trump’s direction for this latest disclosure.""

The newly released King assassination files contain investigative leads, interviews with associates of James Earl Ray, and previously undisclosed information about international intelligence cooperation during Ray's pursuit, according to US government officials.

A recently disclosed audio recording features a police interview with Jerry Ray, the brother of James Earl Ray. Officials noted that these documents had remained undigitised and neglected in various federal facilities for many years.

The quality of numerous documents has deteriorated significantly due to age and digitalisation. The records encompass diverse aspects of the investigation, including newspaper articles, public information, details about Ray's attendance at dance lessons and locksmith training, and his preference for using pseudonyms inspired by James Bond literature.





The Trump administration dropped documents on Monday, and no, it wasn’t the long-awaited Epstein files. Instead, the release spotlighted two old favourites: the FBI's surveillance of Martin Luther King Jr and his assassination in 1968, and Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server and mishandling of highly classified information during her time as Secretary of State.More than 6,000 documents — adding up to nearly 250,000 pages — tied to the 1968 assassination of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and 35 pages from Hilary Clinton's file were made public late Monday.Hillary Clinton, who held the position of secretary of state in Barack Obama's administration between 2009 and 2013, faced an FBI investigation regarding allegations of inappropriate handling of classified information through a private email server. In 2016, prior to the significant presidential election between Clinton and Donald Trump, the FBI recommended to the Department of Justice against pursuing criminal charges in the matter.This came after director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard's bombshell claims that Obama-era officials reportedly ""manufactured and politicized intelligence"" to create the narrative that Russia was attempting to influence the 2016 presidential election.Martin Luther King Jr lost his life to an assassin's shooting in Memphis, Tennessee, on April 4, 1968, while broadening his focus beyond the peaceful movement for African American civil rights to encompass economic equality and peace advocacy. His tragic passing sent shockwaves across the United States during a tumultuous year marked by racial unrest, protests against the Vietnam War, and the subsequent assassination of presidential hopeful Robert F. Kennedy.Gabbard released the documents in partnership with the justice department, central intelligence agency, national archives and the FBI, detail the federal investigation into the shooting at Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tenn., which resulted in 39-year-old King’s death.","More than 6,000 documents — adding up to nearly 250,000 pages — tied to the 1968 assassination of Rev.
