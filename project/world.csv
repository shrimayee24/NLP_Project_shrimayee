Another body of a woman, probably that of the sixth missing person, was found floating in the Barak river in Cachar district of Assam, which shares border with Jiribam.Six people - three women and three children - belonging to the Meitei community had gone missing from a relief camp in Jiribam after a gunfight between security forces and suspected Kuki-Zo militants that resulted in the deaths of 10 insurgents on November 11.Six bodies were found in Jiri river in Jiribam and Barak river in Cachar over the last few days.

NEW DELHI: Former Delhi transport minister and Aam Aadmi Party's prominent Jat face in Delhi, Kailash Gahlot , on Monday joined the BJP ahead of the assembly elections.Gahlot joined the BJP in the presence of Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva, day after resigning from his post as minister and member of the Arvind Kejriwal-led ruling party.""It was not an easy decision for me as I was associated with AAP since Anna Hajare's movement. A narrative is being built that I took the decision under ED, CBI pressure which I strongly refute. I had joined the AAP with a hope to bring change but the values for which we fought were being compromised, which prompted me to quit the AAP and join BJP,"" Kailash Gahlot said.The former AAP minister said that the AAP strayed from its core values and ethics and these sentiments were mirrored by thousands of party workers. If a government, on a drop of a hat, waste its time fighting Centre, than it's certainly not doing its work, he said.Citing reasons behind his decision to quit AAP, Kailash Gahlot had alleged that political ambitions have overtaken party's commitment towards people.He said that ""we have been increasingly only been fighting for our own political agenda"" instead of people's rights.In his resignation letter, the Delhi transport minister also cited recent controversies facing the party and unfulfilled promises to people.Gahlot, who is the MLA from Najafgarh, tendered his resignation from the council of ministers with immediate effect. Official sources said the resignation was accepted by Delhi chief minister Atishi.He was incharge of portfolios of Home, Administrative Reforms, IT and Women and Child Development.Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convener Arvind Kejriwal, commenting on Kailash Gahlot joining the BJP, said on Tuesday that ""He is free, he can go wherever he wants.""Earlier on Sunday, AAP launched a sharp attack on BJP over the resignation of minister Kailash Gahlot, saying it was driven by pressure from ED and CBI at the behest of the Centre.Senior AAP functionary and MP Sanjay Singh called the resignation a part of BJP’s ‘dirty politics’, while chief party spokesperson Priyanka Kakkar asserted that Gahlot chose to join BJP to avoid imprisonment amid ongoing ED and CBI investigations against him and his family.Sanjay Singh said, “Pressure was created on Gahlot by conducting ED-CBI raids and, now, he is speaking according to the script given to him by BJP. The Modi Washing Machine has become active before Delhi elections. Now many functionaries will be inducted into BJP through this machine.”He added: “This is the nature of BJP, when they use agencies to raid someone’s property or summon them for questioning, they hold loud press conferences, accusing the person of corruption. Yet, as soon as that person joins BJP, all charges are miraculously dropped.”(With agency inputs)","Kailash Gahlot, a prominent Jat face in Delhi, on Monday joined the BJP ahead of the assembly elections.

NEW DELHI: Violence in Manipur continued to escalate on Monday, with one protester killed and six others dying in separate incidents, as clashes between security forces and civilians intensified. The unrest has forced the imposition of curfews and internet shutdowns across several districts, including Imphal East and West, amid growing concerns about public order.Union home minister Amit Shah chaired a high-level meeting on Monday to assess the security situation and formulate strategies to stabilise the region.Manipur's Kuki organisations announced plans for a 'coffin rally' in Churachandpur on Tuesday to honour and express solidarity with the 10 Kuki-Zo youths who lost their lives in an alleged confrontation with CRPF in Manipur's Jiribam district.The Zomi Students' Federation (ZSF), Kuki Students' Organisation (KSO), and Hmar Students' Association (HSA) issued a 'joint public notice' on Monday, instructing educational institutions to send students of class 10 and above to attend the event in black attire.An organiser informed PTI about their plans to carry 10 symbolic coffins to honour the deceased youths, as their remains are currently at a local hospital's morgue.Following post-mortem procedures at a Silchar hospital in Assam, the bodies were transported to Churachandpur, a predominantly Kuki district, on Saturday afternoon.The Indigenous Tribal Leaders' Forum (ITLF), which represents the Kuki-Zo community in Manipur, declared on Sunday that funeral services for the 10 youths would be postponed until the families receive their post-mortem reports.After the National People's Party withdraw its support from 60-member Manipur assembly, Naga People's Front (NPF) and BJP MLAs arrived at the residence of CM N Biren Singh, in Imphal. This meeting seems to be focused on the violence in Manipur.In violation of curfew directives, COCOMI members, an influential organisation of the Meitei community, and their supporters on Monday secured the entrances of various government establishments in Imphal West district, expressing outrage over the recent deaths of three women and three children in Jiribam, according to officials. COCOMI, representing the Meitei community, holds significant influence in the Imphal Valley's five districts, including Imphal West, where Meiteis constitute the predominant ethnic group.The demonstrators forcefully entered the Chief Electoral Officer's office complex at Lamphelpat, securing its primary entrance with chains and padlocks, as reported by officials.The protesters also padlocked the main entrances of the Institute of Bioresources and Sustainable Development (IBSD) at Takyel, along with the Directorate of Economics and Statistics, situated a short distance from the CEO's office.The Manipur government on Monday extended the suspension of internet services by two more days till Wednesday in seven districts including Imphal East and West of the northeastern state.Earlier on November 16, the internet was suspended for the seven districts after the fresh violence erupted in the state. The people are staying in Manipur without internet for the past two days and now this extension has only made caused them more trouble.While addressing a press briefing, Lok Sabha LoP and Congress MP Rahul Gandhi said that the Bharatiya Janata Party members spread hatred and that is the reason why 'aag lagti hai' .He also said that home minister Amit Shah should do his job of restoring the peace in the state.""Everyone knows what is happening in Manipur. The Prime Minister has not gone there yet. I have gone to Manipur. We have asked the government to stop the violence. Someone has a vested interest. The Home Minister should do his work, but for some reason, he is not doing his work. Peace should be restored there. BJP people spread hatred, that is why 'aag lagti hai'. 'Aag ko sirf Congress mita sakti hain' because we talk about love, brotherhood..."" Rahul Gandhi said.The Congress party urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to visit the strife-affected state ahead of the Parliament session and called for Amit Shah's resignation, citing the complete breakdown of the ""double engine government.""Jairam Ramesh, Congress general secretary handling communications, insisted that the PM should meet with a multi-party delegation from Manipur and subsequently arrange a national-level all-party discussion before the Parliament session commencing November 25.During a media briefing at the AICC headquarters, Ramesh called for the resignations of both Shah and chief minister N Biren Singh.""From May 3, 2023, Manipur is burning and PM Modi visits various countries of the world, gives sermons, but could not find time to visit Manipur. So, our first demand is that PM should take time out before the Parliament session to visit Manipur and meet political parties, politicians, civil society groups, and people in relief camps there,"" Ramesh said.""There is a strange 'jugalbandi' between the home minister and the failed CM. Why the home minister has not taken cognizance of the CM's failures and why has he been attempting to save him?"" Ramesh said.""The double engine government has failed and has been derailed. The home minister is directly responsible. We want the Home Minister to resign because it is his responsibility,"" he added.The Centre has announced the deployment of an additional 50 companies of Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) to Manipur, bringing over 5,000 personnel to assist in managing the ongoing security crisis, PTI reported quoting sources. This follows an earlier dispatch of 20 CAPF companies, including 15 from the CRPF and five from the BSF, in response to recent violence in Jiribam district.The latest deployment, which includes 35 units from the CRPF and the remainder from the BSF, is aimed at addressing the increasingly volatile situation. With this new addition, the total number of CAPF companies in Manipur will rise to 218.On Sunday night, a protester in his twenties, identified as K Athouba, was killed during a clash with security forces in Jiribam district, according to ANI. Police said that the agitators who vandalised properties near Babupara faced firing, though it remains unclear who opened fire. Eyewitnesses alleged the shots came from the direction of security forces.Bodies Found in Assam River After Manipur UnrestMeanwhile, two bodies, an unidentified woman and a young girl, were found in Assam's Barak river. The bodies were discovered inside a gunny sack.This discovery follows unrest in neighboring Manipur sparked by the discovery of six bodies. The six victims, found earlier on Sunday, are believed to be three women and three children who went missing from a relief camp in Jiribam, Manipur. Jiribam has been experiencing violence, leading to the displacement of many and the establishment of relief camps.The Union home ministry transferred three cases of violence against civilians to the National Investigation Agency (NIA). The cases involve allegations of widespread arson and ransacking, which police say led to the arrest of 23 individuals from various districts, including Imphal East, West, and Bishnupur.The NIA took over these cases from Manipur Police following a directive from the ministry of home affairs, as the violent incidents linked to the cases had escalated in recent months, resulting in fatalities and significant unrest in the region.Union home minister Amit Shah convened a high-level meeting with senior officials in the national capital and assessed the security situation in Manipur.During the meeting, the central government decided to deploy an additional 50 companies of the Central Armed Police Forces, totalling over 5,000 personnel, to Manipur due to the challenging situation in the state.The meeting comes after Shah cancelled election rallies in Maharashtra to focus on the deteriorating conditions in the northeastern state.In response to the worsening security situation, chief minister N Biren Singh convened a meeting with ruling NDA ministers and MLAs on Monday evening to assess the law and order crisis, officials told news agency ANI. This comes after the National People's Party (NPP) withdrew its support from the BJP-led government, citing the CM's failure to resolve the ongoing conflict. Despite the NPP's withdrawal, the BJP retains a majority in the state assembly with 32 MLAs, supported by five MLAs from the Naga People's Front (NPF) and six from the JD(U).Following the killings, the authorities imposed an indefinite curfew in Imphal East and West, alongside a suspension of internet services in seven districts. Streets in Imphal remain largely deserted, with heavy deployment of security personnel outside key sites such as the chief minister’s residence and the Raj Bhavan.Markets and public transport services are shut, with only pharmacies and a few private vehicles operating. Security has also been heightened around legislators' residences, following several arson attacks over the weekend.The Centre has also reimposed the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA) in violence-hit areas, underlining the gravity of the situation.In Imphal valley, enraged mobs torched the homes of multiple political figures, including BJP and Congress legislators. On Saturday night, the ancestral residence of chief minister N Biren Singh narrowly escaped being stormed by protesters. The incidents are linked to public outrage over the killings of women and children allegedly abducted by militants in Jiribam district.On Sunday, the National People's Party (NPP) announced its withdrawal of support from the BJP-led government, citing its inability to restore peace. However, the BJP retains a majority in the 60-member Assembly with 32 MLAs, along with support from other parties.Manipur has been embroiled in ethnic violence since May 2023, following clashes during a rally organised by the All Tribals Students Union (ATSU) against the Meitei community's demand for Scheduled Tribe status. Over 220 people have been killed, and thousands displaced as tensions persist between the Meiteis and Kuki-Zo groups.The Communist Party of India (Marxist) also voiced its concern over the violence in Manipur, calling for immediate intervention by the Union government to restore peace.In a statement, the CPI(M) Politburo condemned the violence. They also highlighted the discovery of five bodies of women and children who had been abducted, exacerbating the crisis. The Left party blamed N Biren Singh for the deteriorating situation, accusing him of failing to manage the violence. CPI(M) questioned why Singh was still in power despite his inability to control the unrest.","Manipur's Kuki organisations announced plans for a 'coffin rally' in Churachandpur on Tuesday to honour and express solidarity with the 10 Kuki-Zo youths who lost their lives in an alleged confrontation with CRPF in Manipur's Jiribam district.

Diddy’s public apology

Legal troubles mount for Diddy

Recently leaked text messages between Cassie, the R&B artist and former partner of Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs, have unveiled harrowing details about the 2016 assault and their turbulent relationship. The messages depict a pattern of alleged physical abuse, including an incident that left Cassie with visible injuries.“I have a black eye and fat lip. You always want to show me that you have the power and knock me around,” Cassie wrote in one of the texts, obtained by Enstarz.Further texts detail the chilling aftermath of an assault: “You drag me down the hall by my hair… I have bleeding cuts… You hit me in the head two good times.”“When you get f**ked up the wrong way, you always want to show me that you have the power and you knock me around. I’m not a rag doll. I’m someone’s child,” Cassie said in her texts messages.These messages, paired with surveillance footage from 2016, paint a grim picture of Cassie’s ordeal during her relationship with the music mogul.The video from March 2016, obtained by CNN recorded at the now-closed InterContinental Hotel in Los Angeles, appears to corroborate Cassie’s claims. The footage shows Cassie leaving a hotel room, followed by Diddy, dressed in a towel. He grabs her by the neck, throws her to the floor, and kicks her twice while she lies motionless.Diddy is also seen dragging Cassie by her sweatshirt and hurling an object at her before sitting down in the hallway. The video ends with Diddy confronting her near the elevator. Prosecutors describe the video as undeniable evidence of abuse, while Diddy’s legal team alleges its release was improperly leaked to the media.In response to the video, Diddy posted a video statement on Instagram earlier this year. “My behaviour on that video is inexcusable. I take full responsibility for my actions in that video,” he admitted.“I was disgusted then when I did it. I’m disgusted now,” he added. “I sought therapy and rehab. I had to ask God for mercy and grace. I’m not asking for forgiveness. I’m truly sorry and committed to becoming a better man every day.”Prosecutors claim Sean “Diddy” Combs has tried to influence potential jurors and witnesses for his upcoming sex trafficking trial while incarcerated, in an attempt to sway public opinion and impact the case. In a Manhattan court filing, prosecutors opposed his $50 million bail request, arguing that jail calls show Combs asked family members to contact victims and witnesses, urging them to create narratives favorable to his defense.They also allege he orchestrated a social media campaign around his birthday to influence jurors. Combs, 55, faces charges of coercion, abuse, and blackmail, with prosecutors arguing he’s a flight risk and a danger to the community. This marks his third failed attempt for bail, following two rejections.","Leaked text messages between Cassie, the R&B artist and former partner of Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs, have unveiled harrowing details about the 2016 assault and their turbulent relationship.

Whoopi Goldberg: Did The View co-host Whoopi Goldberg lie about a NYC bakery not taking her order?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-the-view-co-host-whoopi-goldberg-lie-about-a-nyc-bakery-not-taking-her-order/articleshow/115416779.cms,"Local officials are calling on The View co-host Whoopi Goldberg to issue an apology to a New York City bakery she accused of refusing to fulfil her order due to political bias.Holtermann’s Bakery, a 146-year-old family-run business in Staten Island, explained that it wasn’t accepting pre-orders at the time because of issues with its ageing boiler. The bakery stated that the unreliable equipment had disrupted its operations.“Staten Islanders do not discriminate based on political beliefs,” said New York City Councillor David Carr at a press conference on Friday. He was joined by fellow Republicans Staten Island Borough President Vito Fossella and State Assembly Members Michael Tannousis, Michael Reilly, and Sam Pirozzolo, as well as Democratic State Senator Jessica Scarcella-Spanton, to demand an apology following Goldberg’s comments on Wednesday’s episode of The View.The controversy began when Goldberg celebrated her 69th birthday by sharing Charlotte Russe desserts—sponge cakes topped with jam, whipped cream, and a Maraschino cherry. During the segment, Goldberg claimed a bakery had refused to make them for her, allegedly due to her progressive political views. She told the audience:“I should tell you, Charlotte Russe has no political leanings, and the place that made these refused to make them for me. They said their ovens had gone down, but folks went and got them anyway, which is why I’m not telling you who made them.”Although Goldberg did not name the bakery, viewers identified Holtermann’s from the packaging, putting the business under scrutiny. Owner Jill Holtermann confirmed that a representative from The View had attempted to pre-order 50Charlotte Russe desserts for Goldberg’s 6th and 13th November appearances but was turned down due to the bakery’s boiler problems.“I told Whoopi, ‘I can’t do it right now,’” Holtermann told Entertainment Weekly. “Our boiler is unreliable, and the building is from 1930. I didn’t know if we could meet all our baking commitments.”Despite the pre-order being declined, a staff member from The View managed to purchase 50 Charlotte Russe desserts in person on 13th November. Holtermann said they were unaware of the buyer’s connection to the show.Frank Scarangello of Scaran Plumbing, who replaced the bakery’s boiler, supported the bakery’s explanation. “Bakers rely on steam for many of their processes,” he told the Staten Island Advance. “Whoopi’s claim isn’t fair—it was simply a matter of a broken boiler.”During Friday’s press conference, drivers passing by the bakery expressed their support, some honking and shouting, “F— you, Whoopi!” Meanwhile, officials called for Goldberg to issue a public apology, emphasising that the situation arose from equipment issues, not politics.","The View co-host accused bakery of refusing to make desserts for her.

An aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is accused of leaking classified information to foreign media to influence public opinion on hostage negotiations , according to information released by an Israeli court on Sunday.The Rishon Lezion Magistrate’s Court, Israel, said that the leak involved a highly classified military intelligence document given to Germany’snewspaper in September this year, The Times of Israel reported. The aim was reportedly to reduce public criticism of Netanyahu after six high-profile hostages were killed by Hamas in late August.The court identified Eli Feldstein , an aide to Netanyahu, as a key suspect in the case. The document was allegedly leaked to shift public focus on the hostage situation, hold Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar responsible for delays in negotiations, and suggest that protests demanding hostage releases were helping Hamas.Feldstein was arrested earlier in the month for leaking “classified and sensitive intelligence information,” court documents said.The court explained that the leak began when a non-commissioned officer (NCO) in the Israeli military reserves removed a “highly sensitive and classified document” from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). In April, the NCO reportedly sent this document to Feldstein.Feldstein later shared it with Israeli media outlets in September “with the aim of influencing public opinion on the ongoing negotiations concerning the hostages,” according to the release.Since Israeli media outlets were prohibited from publishing the leaked document due to censorship laws, Feldstein “decided to bypass censorship and publish the document in foreign media.”In September, two articles referencing the leaked information were published in the United Kingdom’sand Germany’s. Both cited Israeli intelligence sources and aligned with Netanyahu’s stance at the time.",Aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is accused of leaking classified information to foreign media.

"Joe Biden ups the ante, allows Ukraine to use US missiles for strikes inside Russia",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/joe-biden-ups-the-ante-allows-ukraine-to-use-us-missiles-for-strikes-inside-russia/articleshow/115421901.cms,"File photo: President Joe Biden and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy

Driving the news

The Biden administration's decision to allow Ukrainians to use the long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, was a response to Russia’s unexpected move to deploy North Korean troops in the conflict, a New York Times report said quoting US officials.

A US official noted the surge of North Korean forces—estimated to exceed 10,000 troops in the strategically critical Kursk region—has created an exigency that could not be ignored.

The ATACMS provides military commanders with the capability to strike targets deep behind enemy lines, enhancing operational flexibility and effectiveness in modern warfare

The Russian military is gearing up for a significant offensive involving an estimated 50,000 soldiers, including North Korean troops, aimed at entrenched Ukrainian positions in Kursk. The objective of this assault is to reclaim the Russian territory that Ukrainian forces captured in August.

In response, Ukraine could deploy ATACMS missiles to target Russian and North Korean troop concentrations, critical military assets, logistics hubs, ammunition depots, and supply lines deep within Russian territory. Such strikes could disrupt and weaken the effectiveness of the anticipated Russian-North Korean counteroffensive, providing Ukraine with a strategic advantage.

Why it matters

The decision marks one of Biden's last major acts before handing over power to President-elect Donald Trump in January 2025.

in January 2025. The authorization to use the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) for strikes inside Russia signals an important shift in US support for Ukraine. Previously, Washington had refrained from such escalatory measures, fearing they might provoke Russia into a broader conflict that could draw Nato into direct confrontation with a nuclear-armed adversary.

However, Biden’s decision reflects mounting concerns over Russia's intensifying military campaign, now backed by North Korean troops and resources.

Ukraine's Nato allies, including key players like the UK and France, have also faced internal debates over allowing such strikes. The US green light could pressure these allies to reconsider their own restrictions on military support. For Ukraine, this development comes as both a strategic opportunity and a test of its ability to leverage long-range strikes to disrupt Russian supply chains and military assets.

The decision, however, takes place against a backdrop of shifting geopolitical currents as Trump, who has expressed skepticism about unconditional US support for Ukraine, prepares to take office.

Nearly two months before demoting office, Biden's upping the ante against Russia and Putin may put incoming Trump administration in a fix. Trump’s public rhetoric on the campaign trail included promises to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict in 24 hours of taking office.

The big picture

This latest move continues a familiar pattern: initial US reluctance to provide Ukraine with advanced weaponry followed by eventual approval under sustained pressure from Kyiv and its supporters.

The ATACMS approval mirrors earlier debates over providing HIMARS systems, Abrams tanks, and F-16 fighter jets. The Biden administration’s longstanding concern about escalation has often led to hesitation, but recent developments forced a reassessment. The deployment of North Korean troops to Russia’s conflict zone was a tipping point, signaling an escalation that Washington deemed necessary to counter.

Experts agree that while ATACMS could offer Ukraine strategic gains by targeting Russian military logistics and command centers deeper into Russian territory, their impact on the overall trajectory of the war is limited by their scarcity. Ukraine has been operating with a constrained supply of long-range munitions, making each missile strike a high-stakes calculation.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has long urged the US and its allies to lift restrictions on long-range strikes, arguing that such capabilities are crucial to countering Russian offensives. Following Biden’s decision, Zelensky said, “Strikes are not made with words. The missiles will speak for themselves,” emphasizing readiness without confirming immediate plans.

Zoom In

What they are saying

Reactions have ranged from supportive to critical. Nicholas Williams, a former senior Nato official, described the authorization as “significant in terms of the end game,” suggesting it could strengthen Ukraine’s hand in future negotiations.

However, critics, including Donald Trump Jr, have accused Biden of setting the stage for escalation. Trump Jr took to social media, saying, “The Military Industrial Complex seems to want to make sure they get World War 3 going before my father has a chance to create peace.”

going before my father has a chance to create peace.” The Kremlin accused Biden of intensifying the conflict in Ukraine by authorizing Kyiv to use long-range missiles supplied by Washington to hit targets within Russia.

""It's obvious that the outgoing administration in Washington intends to take steps in order to continue fuelling the fire and provoke a further escalation of tensions,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.

""These guys, Biden's administration, is trying to escalate the situation to the maximum while they still have power and are still in office,"" Russian lawmaker Maria Butina told Reuters.

""I have a great hope that (Donald) Trump will overcome this decision if this has been made because they are seriously risking the start of World War Three which is not in anybody's interest, "" Butina added.

Andrei Klishas, a senior member of Russia’s Federation Council, commented on social media that such actions could result in “the Ukrainian statehood in complete ruins by morning,” reflecting the severity of the potential response.

A Western diplomat in Kyiv, speaking to BBC on condition of anonymity, remarked, ""I don't think it will be decisive."" ""However, it’s an overdue symbolic decision to raise the stakes and demonstrate military support to Ukraine,"" the diplomat added. ""It can raise the war cost for Russia.""

Within the US, the decision has rekindled debates among lawmakers. Republican Representative Mike Turner, chair of the House Intelligence Committee, called the move “long overdue” but noted that “there are still too many restrictions on Ukraine.” He added that this step could apply pressure on President-elect Trump to reassess how he plans to approach the conflict when he takes office.

Between the lines

What’s next

Ukraine is expected to conduct its first long-range strikes soon, which could influence battlefield dynamics and negotiations ahead of Trump’s inauguration.

The next administration’s policy toward Ukraine remains uncertain, especially given Trump's previous statements about reducing US military support and prioritizing diplomatic solutions. Trump’s incoming national security advisor, Mike Waltz, has already expressed skepticism about continued financial and military aid, calling it a “stalemate.”

This policy shift may also push European allies to reconsider their positions. Countries like the UK and Germany have been cautious about supplying Ukraine with long-range missiles, such as the Storm Shadow and Taurus systems, due to the risk of escalation. Biden’s decision could encourage these nations to align their policies more closely with Washington’s new stance.

The bottom line

President Joe Biden has made an unexpected policy shift by granting Ukraine permission to deploy American-provided long-range missiles for strikes inside Russia. This significant decision concludes a prolonged period of strategic deliberation that had left Ukraine in a state of uncertainty since the conflict's beginning.North Korea's involvement has introduced a new layer of complexity to the conflict. Intelligence reports estimate that over 10,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia, focusing primarily on the contested Kursk region, which Ukraine had reclaimed in part during a counteroffensive in August.This deployment not only bolsters Russian manpower but also signals an expanding international dimension to the war, drawing the attention of Washington and its Indo-Pacific allies. Radoslaw Sikorski, Poland's foreign minister, underscored the significance of the US move, saying, “President Biden responded to the entry of North Korean troops... in a language that Putin understands.”The North Korean presence also has implications for Ukraine’s strategy. Analysts predict that with ATACMS now in play, Kyiv may target logistical hubs and military installations where these troops are stationed. The move is intended to disrupt supply routes and complicate Russian advances, putting added pressure on the Kremlin's war machine.Biden’s authorization illustrates the administration’s tightrope walk between providing Ukraine with the tools it needs and avoiding a direct clash with Russia. The decision comes after months of resistance, with US officials concerned about potential retaliation and the depletion of ATACMS stockpiles. The weapon's long-range capability—up to 190 miles—enables Ukraine to strike critical Russian military assets that were previously beyond reach. This could disrupt Russian command structures and airfields, which are essential for sustaining Moscow’s war efforts.Despite these potential benefits, there are risks involved. Moscow has hinted at retaliatory measures that could extend beyond Ukraine and impact Nato member states. Russia’s intelligence services have been linked to sabotage incidents in Europe, raising fears of covert actions as part of its response strategy.Biden’s authorization to allow Ukraine to strike deep within Russian territory represents both an opportunity and a challenge. It aims to empower Ukraine while signaling resolve to counter increasing threats from Russia's allies like North Korea. As Trump prepares to take office with pledges of peace and reduced support, the stakes for Ukraine’s strategic position—and the future of US involvement—are higher than ever. The decision’s long-term effects on the conflict and its potential to shape diplomatic outcomes will be closely watched by allies and adversaries alike.(With inputs from agencies)",Biden's decision is a response to Russia's unexpected move to deploy North Korean troops in the conflict.

Hong Kong Pro-Democracy Activists: 45 pro-democracy activists sentenced to prison in Hong Kong's national security trial,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/45-pro-democracy-activists-sentenced-to-prison-in-hong-kong/articleshow/115433822.cms,"Hong Kong activists march with a banner which reads "" Unite now in solidarity with the Hong Kong 47 and other political prisoners"" during a protest (Photo: AP)

A court in Hong Kong sentenced 45 pro-democracy activists to prison on Tuesday. The sentences range from four years to ten years. This is the largest trial under the city's national security law imposed by Beijing.After a 118-day trial, 14 activists were found guilty in May, while the other 31 pleaded guilty. These sentences are having a major impact on Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement .Benny Tai, a former legal scholar, received the longest sentence of 10 years for subversion. The activists were found guilty of organizing an unofficial ""primary election"" in 2020. The court said they aimed to disrupt the government if elected.The trial included pro-democracy figures like Au Nok-hin, Andrew Chiu, Ben Chung, and Australian citizen Gordon Ng. They received sentences of up to seven years and three months.The court's ruling has drawn criticism from international observers, with Australia expressing concern over the sentencing of Gordon Ng. ""This is a deeply difficult time for Mr Ng, his family and supporters,"" said foreign minister Penny Wong, reiterating ""strong objections"" to the ""continuing broad application of national security legislation.""The United States called the trial politically motivated. ""The democrats should be released as they had been peacefully participating in political activities that were legal,” said the US government.The Hong Kong and Chinese governments defended the law. They said it is needed to maintain order after the 2019 unrest.The court hearings drew many supporters. “I feel such an injustice needs witnessing,” said Margaret, 59, who had been in line since Sunday. “I've long followed their case. They need to know they still have public support.”These convictions follow the arrest of 47 activists in 2021. They were charged under the national security law, which Beijing imposed in 2020. The law aimed to stop dissent after pro-democracy protests in 2019.","Hong Kong court sentences 45 pro-democracy activists to prison. The sentences range from four years to ten years.

STOCKHOLM: Sweden on Monday began sending millions of pamphlets advising residents how to prepare for possible war and Finland launched a new website, as Ukraine fights the grinding three-year Russian invasion.The Nordic neighbours have dropped decades of military non-alignment to join the US-led defence alliance Nato in the wake of Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.""The security situation is serious and we all need to strengthen our resilience to face various crises and ultimately war,"" said Mikael Frisell, the director of the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB) which sent out the brochures.Since the start of the war in Ukraine, Stockholm has repeatedly urged Swedes to prepare both mentally and logistically for the possibility of an armed conflict.After the end of the Cold War, the country drastically slashed its defence spending as it focused its military efforts on international peacekeeping missions.But it reversed course following Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea.Since then, Stockholm has reintroduced limited conscription, massively increased defence spending and reopened a garrison on the Baltic Sea island of Gotland.It subsequently strengthened bomb shelters, shored up drinking water supplies and transport infrastructure, appointed a minister of civil defence and established a Psychological Defence Agency aimed at combatting disinformation.The 32-page booklet ""If Crisis or War Comes"", which started being distributed from Monday, contains information about how to prepare for war, natural disasters and cyber or terror attacks.Sent to 5.2 million households over the next two weeks, it is an updated version of a pamphlet that Sweden has issued five times since World War II.The new version doesn't mention Russia, Ukraine or other country by name.Civil defence minister Carl-Oskar Bohlin made waves in January when he warned ""there could be war in Sweden"".Sweden's then army chief Micael Byden also alarmed many when he days later said ""Swedes have to mentally prepare for war"".Sweden has not gone to war in more than two centuries.The new pamphlet says: ""Military threat levels are increasing. We must be prepared for the worst-case scenario -- an armed attack on Sweden"".The tips include stocking up non-perishable food and water, keeping cash on hand and growing fruit and vegetables in gardens.The previous version from 2018 was the first time the pamphlet had been sent out since 1961 at the height of the Cold War.MSB said the updated version had a stronger focus on preparing for war than in 2018.The brochure is available in print in both Swedish and English and digital versions are available in several other languages -- including Arabic, Farsi, Ukrainian, Polish, Somali and Finnish.Meanwhile, in a separate move, the government in Finland launched a website gathering information on preparedness for different crises.Finland shares a 1,340-kilometre (830-mile) border with Russia and Helsinki has maintained a higher level of preparedness.But after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, Helsinki announced plans to build a 200-kilometre border fence with Russia.Three metres (10 feet) tall and topped with barbed wire, it is due to be completed by 2026.The country last year closed its eight border crossings with Russia, following an influx of migrants which Helsinki claimed was a hybrid attack orchestrated by Moscow.",Sweden sends millions of pamphlets advising residents how to prepare for possible war.

Russian media mocks Biden



'Nobody can reverse clean energy revolution'



Biden's legacy and the road ahead



The United States President Joe Biden made history Sunday by becoming the first sitting US leader to visit the Amazon rainforest. Biden, in Brazil to attend the G20 summit, used the moment to declare that there's no going back in America's "" clean energy revolution "" and highlighted the urgent need for climate action despite incoming political headwinds from President-elect Donald Trump Meanwhile, Russian state-controlled media outlet RT on social media mocked Biden by sharing a post, captioning, ""where are you going Joe?"" as he can be seen abruptly walking into the forest after his speech, rather than taking the designated path.RT mocked the outgoing president, the network shared a video on X, captioned ""Biden finishes press conference, answers no questions, wanders off into the Amazon Jungle,"" the post implied the 81-year-old president was disoriented.Earlier in the day, an another tweet by RT, sharing a graphic that featured a smiling Biden alongside a headline about his administration's climate policies. The caption read, ""Joe Biden planning his final vacation as US president be like,"" mocking his legacy as his term nears its end.In the tweet, US President had given Ukraine tacit approval to use American missiles against Russian military targets, a sensitive topic amid the ongoing conflict in Eastern Europe.Standing amid towering ferns and against the backdrop of deforested land, Biden reaffirmed his administration’s commitment to fighting climate change. ""Nobody can reverse the clean energy revolution,"" he declared. ""The question now is which government will stand in the way and which will seize the enormous opportunity.""The Amazon rainforest, often called the ""lungs of the Earth,"" plays a critical role in mitigating climate change by storing vast amounts of carbon dioxide. However, the region faces major environmental challenges, with deforestation and drying rivers threatening its ecosystem.Biden’s comments also pointed out the uncertainty of America’s climate leadership under the incoming Trump administration. Trump has vowed to ramp up fossil fuel production, withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, and roll back key climate initiatives, calling global warming a ""hoax.""As Biden wraps up his presidency, his trip to the Amazon highlights the tension between his administration's ambitious climate goals and the challenges posed by his successor's opposing agenda. While Biden has spearheaded historic investments in clean energy and climate action, his achievements face the prospect of being unraveled under Trump’s leadership.Biden’s visit to Brazil coincides with the UN climate conference in Azerbaijan, while Brazil prepares to host the event next year. These gatherings are pivotal as world leaders continue negotiating global solutions to the climate crisis.""Some may seek to deny or delay the clean energy revolution,"" Biden said. ""But its benefits are already being enjoyed by people across the country, regardless of party or politics.""","Russian media mocks US President Joe Biden's trip to the Amazon rainforest.

'You bent the knee': Major outrage from viewers



In a surprise announcement this morning, Morning Joe co-anchors Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski , the two fire-brand Trump critics of MSNBC, said that they visited Donald Trump and his tea, at Mar-a-Lago Friday. This was the first time they met him in person in seven years. “We didn’t see eye-to-eye on a lot of issues and we told him so,” Joe Scarborough said explaining the genesis of the meeting and the need they felt to restart communications, added Mika.In 2018, Donald Trump called them Crazy Mike and Psycho Joe and the husband-wife duo said they have not spoken directly to Trump since March 2020 except for a call Scarborough made to Trump after the attempt on his life in Pennsylvania.Mika said Trump was cheerful and upbeat at the meeting and was interested in finding common ground with Democrats on some of the most divisive issues.""For those asking why we would go speak to the president-elect during such fraught times, especially between us, I guess I would ask back – why wouldn’t we?"" she said. ""Five years of political warfare has deeply divided Washington and the country. We have been as clear as we know how in expressing our deep concerns about President Trump’s actions and words in the coarsening of public debate. But for nearly 80 million Americans, election denialism, public trials, January 6th, were not as important as the issues that moved them to send Donald Trump back to the White House with their vote. Joe and I realize it’s time to do something different, and that starts with not only talking about Donald Trump, but also talking with him.""Brzezinski said it seemed reasonable to patch things up, given the country’s divisions and the fact that Mr. Trump is not seeking reelection. “We know this will be a consequential presidency. The question is whether it will be constructive,” she said.Scarborough, a former Florida US congressman, left the Republican Party in 2017 over his disagreements with Trump.The announcement followed major outrage on social media with Democrat supporters calling Morning Joe dead. Some social media users commented that their announcement looked like a hostage video.""This is why people don't trust the mainstream media anymore. Joe and Mika who constantly attack “fascist” Trump on their show, went to Mar a Lago to talk with Trump over the weekend,"" the X handle Republicans against Trump posted.Scarborough and Brzezinski pre-empted the outrage and said they would not defend Trump on their show. “Don’t be mistaken,” Scarborough said. “We are not here to defend or normalize Donald Trump. We are here to report on him and to hopefully provide you insights that are going to better equip all of us in understanding these deeply unsettling times.”",Morning Joe hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski said they went to Mar-a- Lago to meet President-elect Donald Trump.

Where was Biden? The G-20 photo shows him out of the picture,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/where-was-biden-the-g-20-photo-shows-him-out-of-the-picture/articleshow/115435424.cms,"(AP photo)

Under sunshine and clear blue skies against a picture-perfect backdrop of Rio’s iconic Sugarloaf Mountain, the Group of 20 leaders gathered for their “family photo.” There was just one snag: US President Joe Biden was missing.The traditional photo opportunity descended into farce on Monday when Biden, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Italian premier Giorgia Meloni were absent from the lineup.That only became clear, though, once Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva had posed for the snap with the other world leaders, after which they dispersed for further talks.Was it perhaps an act of protest against the presence of Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who was standing in for President Vladimir Putin? Or had some bilateral meetings run late? In the end, it seems it was down to disorganization.A US official blamed logistical issues and said the family photo was taken early. Biden’s absence wasn’t an act of protest, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.The Brazilian organizers say Biden and the others were late. They may try to herd all the leaders together again for a reshoot — which would be a first in the history of the G-20.But the symbolism was unmistakable. The lack of unity among the leaders is a reflection of how difficult it has been to get everyone on the same page at the summit.Biden has been largely invisible at this gathering as he serves out his last two months in the White House. But he’s by no means the only lame duck. France’s Emmanuel Macron got a beating by voters and Germany’s Olaf Scholz is headed for early elections and will likely be ejected from power.In short, the West appeared in disarray.That allowed China’s Xi Jinping to stroll in and take center stage. Brazil’s Lula was flanked by the previous G-20 host — India’s Narendra Modi — and the next one — South Africa’s Cyril Ramaphosa. Argentina’s Javier Milei, who has been a thorn in Lula’s side, was lurking just behind him and next to Macron, with whom he appears to have struck a bond at this meeting.Lavrov was safely tucked away at the back next to his Saudi counterpart.UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer walked out into the sun alone. Earlier he’d irked Xi by publicly chiding China on human rights and bringing up Taiwan. The chill between the two was palpable as they studiously avoided contact, separated only by Australian leader Anthony Albanese.The adage that a picture is worth a thousand words couldn’t be truer when it comes to the annual G-20 tradition of the family photo. Since its foundation in 1999, this snapshot in time tells the story of the rise and fall of collaboration between the world’s most powerful economies.There have been highs — like when they came together to overcome the global financial crisis in 2008 — and there have been lows.In these moments, leaders often drop their guard. And it’s when they are shuffling around into position — some arriving later (or not at all), some iced out, others whispering and giggling to the side — that keen observers can gain insights into the state of international diplomacy.The body language between leaders often reveals whether they truly like each other or are standing stiffly just waiting for the click of the camera before they can flee.The summit in New Delhi, amid the monsoon rains, presaged the difficulties that lay ahead at that summit. India abandoned the usual set-up because leaders couldn’t agree on what to do with Lavrov after Putin — who’d become a pariah following his 2022 invasion of Ukraine — avoided travel.Since then, the tides have shifted somewhat.Outrage and condemnation have made way for a dawning realization among many leaders here that Ukraine may have to accept the loss of some of its territory in negotiations to end the war.One of the most telling moments in the family gathering was Macron making his way to where Lavrov stood and briefly shaking his hand.Not so long ago, Volodymyr Zelenskiy was the star attraction at global summits and parliaments around the world. But as war fatigue has set in, the chasm between the West that still supports him and the emerging powers of the Global South has widened.Modi didn’t want him stealing the show at the G-20 in New Delhi, that was all about projecting the rise of India, and Lula felt very much the same way.The plan today was to invite everyone and paper over the cracks in global diplomacy. Lula literally hoped to drown out the differences by having more people in the frame.Instead, as Xi was holding hands with fellow leaders and smiling, Meloni came to realize she and Trudeau were missing out.According to a pool report, she gasped and said “The photo!”","The traditional photo opportunity descended into farce on Monday when Biden, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Italian premier Giorgia Meloni were absent.

So, what does Biden decision mean?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-2-0-looms-so-what-does-biden-decision-mean/articleshow/115432969.cms,"KYIV: The US will allow Ukraine to use American-supplied longer-range weapons to conduct strikes inside Russian territory, a long-sought request by Kyiv. The decision on Ukraine's use of the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) comes in the waning days of Joe Biden's presidency, before President-elect Donald Trump, who has said he would bring about a swift end to the war that many fear could force unpalatable concessions from Kyiv, assumes office.The longer-range missiles are likely to be used in response to North Korea's decision to send troops to support Kremlin forces, according to one of the people familiar with the development. Pyongyang's troops are apparently being deployed to help the Russian army drive Ukrainian forces out of Russia's Kursk region, where they launched an incursion in Aug.Military analysts said the impact on the battlefield, where Ukraine has been on the back foot for months, would depend on what limits remained. But while the shift may shore up the Kursk operation, it was unlikely to be a gamechanger overall.There also is no way to know how long the new policy will last. It was criticised by Richard Grenell, one of the closest foreign policy advisers of Trump.The effect depends on the rules set for the weapons' use. If strikes are allowed across all of Russia, they could significantly complicate Moscow's ability to respond to battlefield demands. If strikes are limited to the Kursk, Russia could relocate its command centres and air units to nearby regions. That would also mean many of the valuable targets Ukrainian officials have expressed desire to hit may still be beyond reach. Also, the supply of ATACMS is short. However, the decision may encourage the UK and France to allow Ukraine to use Storm Shadow missiles, aka SCALP missiles, with range of 250km.","Longer-range missiles likely to be used in response to North Korea's decision to send troops to support Kremlin forces.

Industry observers anticipate potential efforts to decelerate EV adoption.Trump said that Duffy would focus on ""Excellence, Competence, Competitiveness and Beauty"" in infrastructure development. He also indicated that Duffy would address aviation safety by removing diversity, equity and inclusion programmes for pilots and air traffic controllers.","US President-elect Donald Trump said he is naming former Wisconsin representative Sean Duffy as transportation secretary.

'Disgusting but frankly unsurprising': 'Morning Joe' hosts criticised for 'opportunistic' meeting with Donald Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/disgusting-but-frankly-unsurprising-morning-joe-hosts-criticised-for-opportunistic-meeting-with-donald-trump/articleshow/115431877.cms,"MSNBC employees are expressing outrage towards "" Morning Joe "" presenters Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski following their disclosure of a recent meeting with US President-elect Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago.An MSNBC staff member told Fox News Digital, ""Cowardice. Doing exactly what [anti-Trump historian] Tim Snyder warns on our air not to do: obey in advance. It's disgusting but frankly unsurprising.""The insider indicated that MSNBC staff now regard the morning programme hosts with contempt, viewing their actions as opportunistic.The criticism has spread to social platforms. MSNBC contributor Jennifer Rubin expressed disgust on Bluesky, whilst host Katie Phang posted on X, ""Normalizing Trump is a bad idea. Period.""""Katie Phang is right. It's normalisation (and it's access bulls---),"" the MSNBC employee shared with Fox News Digital. ""Journalists don't need access to their subjects to hold them to account. None of it is believable. The obvious answer is believable: they are opportunists.""The source suggests MSNBC faces potential viewer backlash over the Mar-a-Lago meeting, with some supporters already calling for boycotts.""This feels serious,"" they noted. ""I can't imagine [parent company] Comcast minds this development. But the MSNBC people do.""A different network source defended the meeting to Fox News Digital, finding the criticism peculiar given that the hosts challenged Trump's positions and rhetoric.""Not sure when going in to voice concerns about threats against journalists and politicians was a bad thing,"" they said.Scarborough addressed potential criticism on Monday morning. ""We're not here to defend or normalise Donald Trump,"" he informed viewers. ""We're here to report on him and to hopefully provide you insights that are going to better equip all of us in understanding these deeply unsettling times.""Scarborough and Brzezinski, once friendly with Trump during the 2016 GOP primary, became strong critics after his presidency began.The recent meeting marked their first encounter with Trump in seven years. They discussed various issues including abortion, deportation, and political retribution threats. The hosts described it as an attempt to ""restart communications.""""For those asking why we would go speak to the president-elect during such fraught times, especially between us, I guess I would ask back – why wouldn't we?"" Brzezinski explained. ""Five years of political warfare has deeply divided Washington and the country. We have been as clear as we know how in expressing our deep concerns about President Trump's actions and words in the coarsening of public debate.""But for nearly 80 million Americans, election denialism, public trials, January 6, were not as important as the issues that moved them to send Donald Trump back to the White House with their vote. Joe and I realize it's time to do something different, and that starts with not only talking about Donald Trump, but also talking with him,"" he added.Trump described the meeting as ""extremely cordial"" to Fox News Digital on Monday. ""I received a call from Joe Scarborough requesting a meeting for him and Mika, and I agreed that it would be a good thing if such a meeting took place,"" Trump said. ""Many things were discussed, and I very much appreciated the fact that they wanted to have open communication ... In many ways, it's too bad that it wasn't done long ago.""""The meeting ended in a very positive manner, and we agreed to speak in the future,"" he concluded.","MSNBC employees express outrage over 'Cowardice' of 'Morning Joe' hosts.

Diddy Sentence: 'Outrageous': Diddy lawyers on materials seized from Sean Comb's jail cell,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/outrageous-diddy-lawyers-on-materials-seized-from-sean-combs-jail-cell/articleshow/115428253.cms,"Diddy's lawyers said it's outrageous that Diddy's cell was raided and then the materials seized from there were used by the prosecutors in court filing.

The prosecutors in the Sean Diddy case recently said that the music mogul is orchestrating social media campaigns from jail and calling witnesses from other inmates' telephone accounts -- breaking jail rules. Lawyers for Sean Diddy Combs Monday accused the prosecutors of engaging in ""outrageous government conduct"" of raiding Diddy's jail cell and seizing materials and then mentioning those in court papers.The lawyers said the information gathered from Combs' cell at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn were cited in papers the government filed in Manhattan federal court Friday in a bid to keep Diddy locked up until his trial begins in May.“This is a matter of grave concern that, most respectfully, must be addressed immediately,” the lawyers told Judge Arun Subramanian, who already has scheduled a bail hearing for Friday for Combs. They requested an “immediate hearing” so prosecutors can explain who authorized the search of Combs' cell, where personal effects and paperwork were seized.Sean Diddy has been arrested on charges of sex trafficking, racketeering and transportation for engagement in sex -- all charges that Diddy refused and did not plead guilty.Meanwhile, more complaints were filed against Diddy with accusers claiming that they were raped by Diddy when they were underage.In a shocking revelation, the prosecutors recently said that Diddy was speaking to people from jail using other inmates' telephone accounts. The prosecutors said a review of the recorded calls divulged that Diddy asked his family to contact potential witnesses in the case. He was also trying to orchestrate social media campaigns aimed at maligning the jury pool and trying to publicly leak materials that would be helpful for him. He involved third parties to contact the witnesses, the prosecutors said.Diddy's lawyers said prosecutors in their bail arguments last week acknowledged that they possess ""possibly privileged materials, such as the notes recovered from the defendant's cell"".",Diddy's lawyers said it's outrageous that Diddy's cell was raided and then the materials seized from there were used by the prosecutors in court filing.

Extortions bleed Pakistan's terror-stalked northwest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/extortions-bleed-pakistans-terror-stalked-northwest/articleshow/115432913.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Surging terror and extortions have endangered public safety in Pakistan's restive northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where militants in several districts run a parallel shadow administration.The southern districts of the province have almost become no-go areas even for law-enforcers. In the evening, militants are seen patrolling streets and setting up checkpoints in Bannu, North and South Waziristan, Tank, Lakki Marwat, and Dera Ismail Khan.While these districts remain at mercy of militants from evening to morning, well-off people in other districts of the province frequently receive threatening WhatsApp texts and letters from Pakistani Taliban - or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) - with demands to pay or face attacks. The ones who refuse to pay ransom are often targeted with grenade attacks at their homes, shops and warehouses, apparently to show the group was serious about its threats.Faisal Khan, a lawyer in in Charsadda district, told TOI that he had got a threatening WhatsApp text earlier this month from an Afghanistan number with a demand to pay $50,000 (Pak Rs 1.4cr). Khan reported the threats to the police and also went to high-ranking officers to request protection and assistance. He claimed he was cautioned by ""allies in the govt"" that he ""should not count"" on them to keep him safe.Shahzaib, another person in the same neighbourhood who had received a similar text on TTP's letterhead last month, has paid after negotiating a deal through intermediaries. He eventually paid a reduced part of the $50,000 the militants initially demanded. ""TTP is demanding extortion from everyone they think can pay. Most, if not all, wealthy individuals have already paid.""Police sources said the main hurdle is tracking down extortionists. In the last two years, at least 1,600 Afghan phone numbers and 387 illegal gateways were used for the extortion calls. ""Despite the rising threat, the issue has yet to attract national attention,"" a senior police official said.","The southern districts of the province have almost become no-go areas even for law-enforcers.

According to police, her body was dismembered into dozens of pieces and dumped in a drain in Punjab province.The crime occurred last week in Daska, Sialkot district, which is approximately 100 km from Lahore.A murder case has been filed against the suspects, and four individuals have been arrested in connection with the crime. The arrested include the mother-in-law, Sughran Bibi; her daughter, Yasmin; her grandson, Hamza; and a distant relative, Navid.Senior police officer Omar Farooq informed reporters that the suspects have confessed to killing Zara and dismembering her body.Zara Qadir, a woman in her 20s, went missing last week, and later, police discovered her dismembered body in three sacks, which was identified as hers.Zara, who was the daughter of a police officer, had married Qadir Ahmad four years ago, and they had a three-year-old son. She went to Saudi Arabia after her marriage and returned to Pakistan only a few months ago.Farooq said, ""In her confessional statement, Sughran Bibi said that she suspected Zara of allegedly practicing 'witchcraft,' and besides, her son Qadir had started sending money directly to Zara's bank account instead of to his mother.""He added that the four suspects smothered the pregnant Zara with a pillow while she was asleep and then proceeded to burn her face. Then, they dismembered her body into dozens of pieces before dumping it in a drain in three sacks.""Based on Zara's father's statement, where he suspected Sughran after she claimed Zara had run away with her lover upon her disappearance, we interrogated Sughran, who confessed to her crime,"" Farooq said.He mentioned that Sughran was also Zara's paternal aunt.Farooq stated that this was a case of extreme jealousy, as the mother-in-law and her daughter not only killed Zara but also dismembered her body out of hatred. He added that Sughran and Yasmin believed Zara's good looks were causing Qadir to favor her and ignore them in the process.","Zara Qadir, a woman in her 20s, went missing last week, and later, police discovered her dismembered body in three sacks, which was identified as hers.
