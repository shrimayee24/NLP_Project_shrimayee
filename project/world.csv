Manipur responds in unity

Tensions in Manipur amid drug crackdown

In a show of solidarity, Manipur Chief Minister N Biren Singh expressed his support for Assam’s fight against illegal opium poppy cultivation , following a significant operation by Assam Police. The destruction of 170 bighas (over 56 acres) of poppy plantations in Goalpara was reported in January, with an estimated value of over Rs 27 crore.Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma took to X on Sunday, uploading a video of the operation, which saw a tractor racing across the poppy fields with heavy police presence. Sarma issued a stern warning to local drug lords, referencing infamous Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar: ""Dear Local Pablo Escobars, sorry to spoil your planned Udta Assam party,"" he wrote, adding that the poppy crops were destroyed by Goalpara Police.Sarma's post also invoked the 2016 Bollywood film Udta Punjab, which tackled drug addiction.In a supportive message, Manipur CM N Biren Singh expressed his appreciation for the strong actions taken by Assam against the poppy trade. ""We stand together in our shared goal of building a future free from the shadow of drugs,"" Singh wrote. He also noted that Manipur had destroyed over 25 acres of illegal poppy plantations in Tengnoupal subdivision's Khudei Khullen hill range, with a first information report (FIR) filed today.Manipur has been grappling with ethnic violence between the Meitei community and Kuki tribes since May 2023.

The mob damaged several vehicles, and an FIR has been filed.The coordinated efforts between Assam and Manipur leaders mark a significant push against illegal drug operations in the northeast, as both states work towards a drug-free future for their youth.","Assam Police destroyed 170 bighas (over 56 acres) of poppy plantations in January, with an estimated value of over Rs 27 crore.

""It is my dream and expectation that someone from outside the tribal community should be appointed for their welfare. Let a Brahmin or a Naidu take charge—there would be significant change. Likewise, tribal leaders should be given the portfolio for the welfare of forward communities.""He further said that such a change should occur within the democratic system and revealed that he had personally requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to allocate the tribal affairs ministry to him. However, he acknowledged that ""certain precedents"" governed portfolio allocations.Currently, BJP leader Jual Oram, a well-known tribal leader from Odisha, heads the ministry of tribal affairs in the Modi-led cabinet.Gopi’s remarks have drawn strong criticism across Kerala, particularly from opposition parties and tribal leaders. CPI state secretary Benoy Viswam condemned the minister’s statements, labeling him a ""piper of the chaturvarna"" ( caste system ) and demanding his removal from the Union ministry.Viswam also called for the resignation of union minister of state George Kurian, accusing him of undermining federal principles and insulting Kerala. Kurian had earlier suggested that Kerala should declare itself backward in education, infrastructure, and social welfare to receive more funds from the Centre.""These two ministers are living examples of the challenges facing the Indian Constitution under the RSS-led BJP regime,"" Viswam said, urging the President, as the custodian of the Constitution, to take the matter seriously. He also demanded that the BJP clarify its stance on what he termed as anti-tribal and anti-Kerala statements by the ministers.Prominent tribal leader CK Janu also denounced Gopi’s comments, calling them ""low-class"" and reflective of his lack of understanding of tribal issues.","Union minister of state for petroleum and natural gas Suresh Gopi sparked controversy by asserting that the tribal affairs ministry should be headed by individuals from the "" upper castes.""

Will faith 'trump' uncertainty? 'Visa temples' give hope to H1-B applicants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-faith-trump-uncertainty-visa-temples-give-hope-to-h1-b-applicants/articleshow/117841961.cms,"Ashok Sundar had just struck out '108' on the little chequered sheet standing inside the Chilkur Balaji temple - 20km from Hyderabad's skyscraper-studded Financial District. His beaming face, glossy polyester shirt and bright red vermilion tilak running right up to the hairline meant that the ""visa god"" had smiled upon him. Ashok got his passport stamped with H-1B a day earlier and was at the temple to show his gratitude. He leaves for his new tech job in New Jersey in April.There were many Ashoks in the sea of people chanting 'Govinda, Govinda' as they walked around the deity at the temple, less than a fortnight after Donald Trump took over as the 47th President of the US. Since taking office, Trump has threatened to send back ""millions and millions of criminal aliens"", send troops to the southern border, and has even ordered the revoking of citizenship status for children of temporary visa holders. The announcements have sent a chill down the spine of the immigrant community, both within the US and among those anxious to go there.Indians dreaming of a new life in the US are now clinging to faith in the hope of a miracle - whether it is the Chilkur Balaji temple near Hyderabad, the Chamatkari Hanuman temple at Ahmedabad or the Shree Siddhi Peeth Chamatkari Hanuman Mandir in Delhi. ""Eleven of us had applied last year,"" says Ashok, after completing his 108th pradakshina (circumambulation) of the temple dedicated to an avatar of Vishnu. ""I am the only one who got the visa. It is only because of Lord Balaji,"" adds the IT executive. He had prayed at the temple after submitting his visa papers in June 2024.Ahmedabad's Chamatkari Hanuman temple, also called 'Visa Hanuman', has swelling crowds during the weekend, with just two prayers on their lips. Either it's ""Lord, please grant me a visa"" or it's ""Lord, thank you for the visa."" The 300-year-old temple has earned a ""visa friendly"" reputation, drawing devotees from as far as J&K and Meghalaya.Pujari Vijay Bhatt says a person wishing to get a visa is first asked to place his or her passport before Lord Hanuman and then repeat the Hanuman Chalisa after the pujari. The applicant is also asked to visit any Hanuman temple once a week and repeat the Hanuman Chalisa. ""It's all about one's 'shraddha'. If there is faith, all things are possible. If doubts creep into one's mind, then one is bound to face disappointment,"" says the priest, adding that he has been witness to instances where a visa has been secured within an hour of conducting the ritual, even after three or four visa denials. One such Ahmedabad resident whose US visa has been rejected once, got to know from friends that praying at the Chamatkari Hanuman temple will work wonders. ""I have complete faith that I will be granted a US visa in my next interview,"" he says, before going through the temple rituals.Down a dusty lane filled with hardware shops stands the Shree Siddhi Peeth Chamatkari Hanuman Mandir at Delhi's Neb Sarai. Pandit Narayan Mishra, who has been officiating at the mandir for the last five years, says people give up meat, alcohol, onion and garlic for 41 days in their quest for the elusive visa stamp. ""They write their manokamna (wish) on a piece of paper. We take the slip of paper and make the idol 'read it' and chant the mantras. It is then placed in a box next to the deity,"" Mishra says.But what makes people come from across the country to the temple? ""Perhaps because Hanuman is considered the first god to have travelled outside the country to Lanka without any paperwork,"" he adds with a smile. Folklore or an attempt at humour, people in the area attest to the ""magical powers"" of the shrine. ""People come in a very disturbed state of mind. This is their last resort, and we usually find that their wishes do come true. Just last week, an applicant who got his US visa in only two weeks came to the temple for a puja to thank God,"" shares Mishra.Though Andhra software engineer Chandana C confesses to being crestfallen after Trump's success in the elections, she is now hopeful that her 25 visits to the Hyderabad temple in the last 25 months will not go in vain. ""I have been coming here every month since I applied for the visa through a local consultancy. I know things aren't looking bright right now, but I have faith I will eventually get it,"" says the 26-year-old desperate to realise her American dream, just like all her other relatives did.Not just for themselves, some even go through the ritual motions for their beloved kin. Kaushik R, on his 56th pradakshina, says that he is there to pray for his older brother living in North Carolina. ""I am praying that his name is selected in the lottery process, and he gets his H-1B. If all goes well, I will also join the University of Cincinnati for a MS programme later this year,"" says the freshly-minted engineering graduate - pinning his hopes on his talent and Lord Balaji in equal measure. ""But I will pray for myself later. This is for my brother,"" Kaushik adds, before quickly returning to his place in the queue. Right behind him is Ravindra R, who has landed himself his dream job in Texas. There's just one step for him to clear now: the visa interview. ""When I go for it, I know I will have Lord Balaji's blessings with me. Nothing can stop me,"" the IT professional says.With additional reporting from Meghdoot Sharon in Ahmedabad(Applicants' names changed on request)","Pujari Vijay Bhatt says a person wishing to get a visa is first asked to place his or her passport before Lord Hanuman and then repeat the Hanuman Chalisa.

What we know about Rebecca Lobach



Was her name kept a secret?

The name of Rebecca Lobach , the third pilot of the military Blackhawk that crashed with an American Airlines plane, was not released until yesterday while the identities of the other two pilots were revealed earlier. There was no survivor in the deadly crash as the remnants of both aircraft fell onto the frozen Potomac River. The reason of the unusual mid-air crash is still unknown while minutes before the crash the military helicopter was warned about the passenger plane.After President Donald Trump blamed the DEI (diversity, equity, inclusivity) hiring policy (of the military) behind the mishap, the Blackhawk pilots came on the radar.Social media users claimed that Rebecca Lobach's identity was withheld because her social media accounts were being deleted. ""They deleted Rebecca Lobach’s social media accounts before releasing her name. It wasn’t to grieve,"" one wrote. ""They didn't withhold Rebecca Lobach's name to ""grieve"", they kept it secret while they scrubbed her social media,"" another wrote.Right-wing commentator and conspiracy theorist Laura Lommer said Rebecca Lobach was a Biden aide who attended Pride events. ""So yes, DEI was very much involved in this crash. Trump was right,"" Loomer wrote hinting that Lobach was a lesbian.""PART TIME Blackhawk pilot, Capt. Rebecca Lobach, was the name being withheld. While her family COMPLETELY scrubbed her social media accounts.

Air traffic control staffing under scrutiny

The US Army on Saturday identified Captain Rebecca M Lobach , 28, of Durham, North Carolina, as the third soldier who died when an Army Black Hawk helicopter collided with an American Airlines jet near Reagan National Airport in Washington, DC, on Wednesday night.Lobach, an Army aviation officer since 2019, was a distinguished military graduate from the University of North Carolina’s ROTC program and ranked in the top 20% of cadets nationwide, her family said in a statement released by the Army.She had logged over 450 flight hours and earned certification as a pilot-in-command after rigorous testing by senior pilots in her battalion.Her family described her as “kind, generous, brilliant, funny, ambitious, and strong,” adding that she also served as a certified sexual harassment and assault response advocate. She had aspirations of becoming a physician after her military service. “We request that you please respect our privacy as we grieve this devastating loss,” the family’s statement read, as per AP.The Army had withheld Lobach’s name at the family’s request, while the identities of the two other soldiers—staff sgt Ryan Austin O’Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia, and chief warrant officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland—were released on Friday.The cause of the collision remains under investigation by the National transportation safety board (NTSB), with officials focusing on multiple factors, including air traffic control procedures, the helicopter’s altitude and the jet’s final approach.US President Donald Trump has publicly blamed the helicopter for allegedly flying too high and has linked the incident to diversity hiring policies at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), though no evidence has emerged suggesting such initiatives played a role in the crash.The 67 victims of the collision included a diverse group of passengers.According to the New York Times, many were returning from a US Figure Skating development camp, including young skaters and their families. Others on board included professionals such as civil rights lawyer Kiah Duggins, engineering student Grace Maxwell, and Moody’s analysts Chris Collins and Melissa Nicandri.A group of duck-hunting friends and an official from the Philippine national police force were also among the deceased.The American Airlines crew, consisting of pilot Jonathan J. Campos, co-pilot Sam Lilley, and flight attendant Danasia Brown Elder, also perished in the crash.According to the news agency AFP, an internal FAA safety report revealed that air traffic control staffing at Reagan National was “not normal” at the time of the crash. A single controller was handling both helicopter traffic and planes arriving and departing, a role typically divided between two controllers.NTSB officials have cautioned against speculation and emphasised that their investigation is ongoing. A preliminary report is expected within 30 days, but a full investigation could take a year to complete.","Captain Rebecca M Lobach, 28, of Durham, North Carolina, has been identified as the third soldier who died in the crash.

Security personnel removed the US Department of Agriculture’s inspector general from her office this week after she refused to accept her dismissal by the Trump administration, sources told Reuters.Phyllis Fong , who had served in the department for 22 years, informed colleagues that she planned to remain in her position despite being terminated by the White House.According to sources, she argued that the administration had not followed the proper procedures. Fong previously served as the first chairperson of CIGIE from 2008 to 2014, according to her USDA biography.In an email to colleagues, reportedly reviewed by Reuters, Fong cited the independent Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency. The council had concluded that the termination notices lacked legal compliance and were therefore ineffective.The White House defended the dismissals of Fong and other inspectors general, claiming that ""these rogue, partisan bureaucrats... have been relieved of their duties to make way for qualified individuals who will uphold the rule of law and protect Democracy.""As USDA’s inspector general, Fong oversaw a broad range of responsibilities, including consumer food safety, audits, and investigations into the Agriculture Department, as well as enforcement of animal welfare laws.

"Thousands block major LA freeway, spray graffiti to protest Donald Trump's immigration crackdown",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/thousands-block-major-la-freeway-spray-graffiti-to-protest-donald-trumps-immigration-crackdown/articleshow/117873838.cms,"'GAME-CHANGER': Border czar Homan reveals staggering drop in illegal border crossings

Thousands of people flooded a major Los Angeles freeway on Sunday morning, causing significant traffic disruptions as they demonstrated against US President Donald Trump's immigration policies. The protest, which was part of a broader movement against the administration's crackdown on illegal immigration, also sparked rallies in Riverside, San Diego, and Dallas.The demonstration began around 9 am on Olvera Street, with protesters waving Mexican flags and carrying signs criticising Trump's policies. Within half an hour, the Los Angeles police department (LAPD) announced street closures due to what they described as a ""non-permitted demonstration blocking traffic."" The California Highway Patrol (CHP) also urged motorists to avoid downtown Los Angeles as they worked to regain control of the situation.Videos circulating on social media showed demonstrators marching onto the 101 Freeway in downtown Los Angeles, temporarily shutting it down between I-110 and Mission Road. Some protesters were seen spraying graffiti on freeway walls and vandalising a car caught in the crowd. Officers in riot gear engaged in a tense standoff with the demonstrators, urging them to clear the freeway.CHP issued a warning on X, saying, ""Please avoid the 101 freeway in DTLA between I-110 and Mission Rd., as we work to remove a protest from the freeway. Accessing state highways or roads to protest is unlawful and extremely dangerous because it puts protesters, motorists, and first responders at great risk of injury.""The demonstration was part of a wave of protests that erupted in various cities over the weekend. In Riverside, hundreds gathered at an intersection as passing motorists honked in support. In San Diego, demonstrators rallied near the city’s convention centre. Meanwhile, in Texas, approximately 1,600 people participated in two protests in downtown Dallas against recent arrests made by US immigration and customs enforcement (ICE).Protesters carried banners with messages such as ""No human is illegal on stolen land"" and ""Fight ignorance, not immigrants."" The demonstrations underscored growing opposition to Trump's aggressive immigration policies, which have led to widespread ICE raids and detentions.Since the start of the new administration, ICE has arrested over 7,400 undocumented immigrants nationwide within a span of nine days. Nearly 6,000 ICE detainers have also been issued. The Trump administration has signalled plans for mass deportations and has suggested sending the most violent undocumented immigrants to Guantánamo Bay. Homeland security secretary Kristi Noem said that authorities are focusing on targeting the ""worst of the worst.""The protests drew sharp criticism from conservative figures on social media. The popular account ""Libs of TikTok"" posted, ""They shut down freeways and stop traffic in one of the most congested cities in the US to try to convince us not to deport them. This isn't gonna end well."" Conservative influencer Benny Johnson echoed similar sentiments, saying, ""Not only are they illegally in our country, they are now illegally blocking roads. This will not end well for them.""The Trump administration's latest immigration crackdown has drawn condemnation from several Democratic leaders, who have vowed to push back against deportation efforts. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that deportation flights have already begun, sharing images of undocumented immigrants boarding military aircraft.California governor Gavin Newsom's office declined to comment on the protests, referring inquiries to the California highway patrol. Meanwhile, Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass was not available for comment.As tensions continue to mount over immigration policies, Sunday's protests highlight the growing division over Trump's approach. With demonstrators taking to the streets in multiple states, the immigration debate shows no signs of cooling down.","Demonstrators flooded a major Los Angeles freeway on Sunday morning, causing significant traffic disruptions.

Time for it to die: Why Donald Trump and Elon Musk want to shut down USAID,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/time-for-it-to-die-why-donald-trump-and-elon-musk-want-to-shut-down-usaid/articleshow/117872858.cms,"With inputs from agencies

The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is an independent agency of the US government responsible for administering civilian foreign aid and development assistance . Established in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy, USAID’s mission is to promote global development, humanitarian efforts, and democratic governance. It operates in over 100 countries, focusing on areas like global health, economic growth, disaster response, and democratic reforms. USAID has historically played a key role in responding to humanitarian crises, supporting economic development, and advancing US foreign policy interests through soft power.Recently, the Trump administration has taken significant steps that raise concerns about the future of USAID. On January 20, 2025, President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 14169, titled ""Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid."" This order imposed a 90-day pause on all US foreign development assistance programs to conduct a comprehensive review of their effectiveness and alignment with national interests. This suspension has affected a wide range of aid programs globally, leading to furloughs and layoffs among aid workers, both in the US and abroad. The move has disrupted projects related to health care, food security, and education in vulnerable regions.The situation escalated further when the Trump administration placed two top USAID security officials, John Voorhees and his deputy Brian McGill, on leave after they refused to grant access to classified materials to inspection teams from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by tech entrepreneur Elon Musk . The DOGE teams lacked the necessary security clearances to access the classified information, which included sensitive intelligence reports. Despite this, DOGE members eventually gained access, raising serious legal and ethical concerns about the handling of national security information.Musk, who formed DOGE in cooperation with the Trump administration, has been vocal about his disdain for USAID, calling it a ""criminal organization"" and stating, “Time for it to die,” in a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter). Musk’s DOGE initiative is designed to streamline government operations, with a focus on firing federal workers, cutting programs, and slashing regulations. This has led to aggressive actions against various federal agencies, including a recent operation at the Treasury Department, where DOGE teams accessed sensitive Social Security and Medicare payment systems, prompting the resignation of a senior Treasury official.USAID’s official website went offline without explanation, further fueling speculation about the agency’s future. Reports from within USAID indicate that staff have encountered outsiders with visitor badges—believed to be DOGE operatives—questioning employees about internal operations. The Trump administration’s crackdown has already led to the furlough of at least 56 senior USAID officials and the dismantling of many foreign aid programs.The administration justifies these actions by claiming that much of USAID’s work is inefficient and misaligned with US interests. President Trump has publicly criticized the agency, stating, “It’s been run by a bunch of radical lunatics. And we’re getting them out.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio has supported the unprecedented freeze on foreign assistance, effectively shutting down USAID’s humanitarian, development, and security programs worldwide, which has resulted in thousands of layoffs among aid organizations.The situation has drawn strong reactions from lawmakers. Senator Elizabeth Warren condemned the administration’s actions, accusing Trump of allowing Musk to access sensitive personal information and shut down critical government functions. “We must do everything in our power to push back and protect people from harm,” Warren stated.As the situation unfolds, the future of USAID remains uncertain. The potential long-term consequences for US foreign policy, global humanitarian efforts, and national security are profound, raising questions about the balance between government efficiency and the safeguarding of democratic institutions and international aid commitments.","The Trump administration has taken significant steps that raise concerns about the future of USAID.

Federal overhaul

WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump said he will discuss the punishing tariffs he has levied on Canada and Mexico with both countries on Monday, after arguing that Americans may feel economic ""pain"" from the 25 percent duties but that it will be ""worth the price.""Speaking to reporters after he flew back to Washington Sunday evening from a weekend in Florida, Trump said he was ""speaking with Prime Minister (Justin) Trudeau tomorrow morning, and I'm also speaking with Mexico tomorrow morning.""""I don't expect anything very dramatic,"" he added.Trump has also hit China with a 10-percent tariff in addition to levies already in place.A fervent supporter of tariffs, Trump had always maintained that their impact would be borne by foreign exporters, without being passed on to American consumers, contradicting the opinion of a broad range of experts.Earlier Sunday he acknowledged, in a series of messages on his Truth Social network, that Americans may feel economic ""pain"" from his tariffs, but argued it would be ""worth the price"" to secure US interests.China, Mexico and Canada are the top three US trade partners and all have vowed to retaliate when the tariffs take effect Tuesday.""Will there be some pain? Yes, maybe (and maybe not!)"" Trump wrote Sunday morning in all-caps on his Truth Social media platform.""But we will Make America Great Again, and it will all be worth the price that must be paid.""Analysts expect the trade war to slow US growth and increase prices, at least in the short term, something the president had resisted acknowledging after frustration over rising costs was seen as a major factor in his 2024 election win.Seeking to limit a spike in fuel prices, Trump has put the levy on energy imports from Canada at only 10 percent.The president has cited illegal immigration and the trafficking of the deadly opioid fentanyl as reasons for the ""emergency"" measures.But on Sunday he also expressed general outrage at trade deficits, which he has long viewed as signs of unfair treatment against the United States.""The USA has major deficits with Canada, Mexico, and China (and almost all countries!), owes 36 Trillion Dollars, and we're not going to be the 'Stupid Country' any longer,"" he wrote.The tariffs announcements capped an extraordinary second week of Trump's new term, with the president facing the worst US aviation disaster in years -- even as his administration moved to drastically overhaul the government in actions decried by critics as illegal.In a separate social media post, Trump took particular aim at Canada, repeating his call for America's northern neighbor to become a US state.Claiming the United States pays ""hundreds of billions of dollars to SUBSIDIZE Canada,"" Trump said that ""without this massive subsidy, Canada ceases to exist as a viable Country.""""Therefore, Canada should become our Cherished 51st State,"" he said, reiterating the expansionist threat against one of his country's closest allies.The US Census Bureau says the 2024 trade deficit in goods with Canada was $55 billion.Canadian backlash was swift, with video posted to social media showing fans at a Toronto Raptors game Sunday booing during the US national anthem.Trudeau vowed Saturday to hit back with 25 percent levies on select American goods worth Can$155 billion (US$106.6 billion), with a first round on Tuesday followed by a second one in three weeks.Leaders of several Canadian provinces have already announced retaliatory actions as well, such as the immediate halt of US liquor purchases.The White House has not publicly announced what actions could end the tariffs.""It's hard to know what more we can do, but we're obviously open to any other suggestions that come our way,"" Canada's ambassador to the United States Kirsten Hillman told ABC News on Sunday.Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she, also, was awaiting Trump's response to her proposal for dialogue.She said she had directed her economy minister to ""implement Plan B,"" which includes unspecified ""tariff and non-tariff measures,"" promising to detail Monday the steps she intends to take.Trump said Sunday he also planned to hit the European Union with tariffs ""pretty soon,"" to which the EU said earlier it would ""respond firmly.""The drastic trade actions follow similarly sharp efforts by Trump's administration to quickly overhaul the federal government in his first two weeks.Trump's close ally Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest person, and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency were also pursuing efforts that were not fully clear, including reported attempts to probe federal payment and e-mail systems.The tumult in the federal government coincided with the collision of an army helicopter and an airliner that killed 67 people in the US capital.Trump, addressing the crash on Thursday as aviation authorities began their formal investigation, baselessly placed the blame on diversity programs.","President Donald Trump says he will discuss the punishing tariffs he has levied on Canada and Mexico with both countries on Monday.

US President Donald Trump announced on Sunday that he would cut off all future funding to South Africa, citing allegations that the government was confiscating land and treating certain classes of people “very badly”.Trump made the announcement in a Truth Social post, stating, “South Africa is confiscating land, and treating certain classes of people very badly. The United States won’t stand for it, we will act. Also, I will be cutting off all future funding to South Africa until a full investigation of this situation has been completed!”.According to US government statistics, the United States allocated nearly $440 million in assistance to South Africa in 2023, covering health programs, economic development, and security cooperation, as per the news agency Reuters.Trump’s decision means future funding will be suspended while his administration looks into alleged human rights violations.The controversy stems from South African President Cyril Ramaphosa ’s recent signing of a land expropriation bill, which allows the government to offer “nil compensation” for property in cases where expropriation is deemed in the public interest.However, the South African government insists that this does not equate to arbitrary seizures and that it will negotiate with landowners first, as per AFP.While land reform remains a sensitive issue in post-apartheid South Africa, critics, including billionaire Elon Musk, a Trump ally and South African-born entrepreneur, have warned that the policy could resemble Zimbabwe’s land seizures of the 1980s, which led to economic collapse.Despite Trump’s move, Ramaphosa has dismissed concerns over relations with Washington. In January, he stated that he had spoken to Trump after his election victory and looked forward to working with his administration.However, the South African government has not yet formally responded to the funding freeze.Trump had previously pledged to investigate alleged violent land takeovers and killings of white farmers in South Africa during his first term, though no evidence of large-scale incidents was found, according to Reuters.The funding cut comes amid Trump’s broader “America First” foreign policy, which has seen him reduce aid to several nations and focus on domestic priorities.","US President Donald Trump announced on Sunday that he would cut off all future funding to South Africa.

Mulino pushes back, says sovereignty “not in question”

US secretary of state Marco Rubio warned Panama’s President José Raúl Mulino on Sunday to reduce China’s influence over the Canal area or face ""measures necessary"" to protect its rights of Americans under the treaty.Rubio’s message, delivered during his first foreign trip as secretary of state, reflects President Donald Trump’s demand for greater US control over the vital trade waterway.Rubio reportedly told Mulino that China’s growing presence in the canal area could violate the 1977 Panama Canal Treaty, which ensured neutrality and free passage for global trade.According to a state department summary, Rubio made it clear that the current status quo is “unacceptable” and that the US could take “measures necessary” to protect its interests, reported the news agency AFP.Panama took full control of the canal in 1999 under the treaty signed by former US President Jimmy Carter. However, Trump has repeatedly questioned whether the US should reclaim authority over the canal, calling it a strategic asset vital to American security.Despite Rubio’s strong message, Mulino downplayed the threat, saying the talks were “respectful” and “positive”. He insisted that Panama’s sovereignty over the canal remains intact, though he acknowledged US concerns by ordering an audit of the Hong Kong-based company Hutchison Ports , which operates ports on both sides of the canal, according to the news agency AFP.Mulino also confirmed that Panama would not renew its Belt and Road Initiative agreement with China once it expires, signalling a possible shift away from Chinese influence .Rubio’s visit sparked anti-US protests in Panama City, where 200 demonstrators gathered, chanting “Marco Rubio out of Panama” and “One territory, one flag”. Protesters burned an effigy of Rubio, along with a banner featuring Trump’s image.

NEW DELHI: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Sunday announced that Canada would impose 25% tariffs on $106 billion worth US imports in a retaliatory move against Donald Trump. This came moments after the latter signed the executive order imposing steep tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada, and China, escalating tensions in an emerging trade war.""Canada will be responding to the US trade action with 25% tariffs against Can$155 billion ($106 billion) worth of American goods,"" he saidHe urged the Canadians to prevent vacationing in US to fight back over the tariff imposition.Further, Trudeau announced that retaliatory duties on $30 billion worth of US alcohol and fruit will take effect Tuesday, coinciding with the implementation of US tariffs. He began his address with a direct message to American consumers.“It will have real consequences for you, the American people,” he said.“The actions taken today by the White House split us apart instead of bringing us together,” Trudeau said, warning that it could bring about “dark times"" for many.Trump declared an economic emergency to impose tariffs of 10% on all imports from China and 25% on goods from Mexico and Canada.

What was the misinformation around Joe Ellis?



Who is Jo Ellis?



'Blackhawk took a bizarre flight path'



After President Donald Trump blamed the DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) hiring policies of the Obama and Biden governments for the tragic mid-air collision between a Blackhawk and an American Airlines plane and an army helicopter, rumors spread that one of the pilots of the helicopter was a transgender person -- Jo Ellis. This was to connect Donald Trump's reasoning with the mishap -- until Jo Ellis issued a video claiming that she is indeed a Blackhawk pilot, but is alive and was not flying the ill-fated helicopter.""Interesting morning. This is Jo Ellis. I am a Blackhawk pilot with the Virginia Army National Guard. I understand some people have associated me with the crash in DC and that is false. It is insulting to the families to try to tie this to some kind of political agenda, They don't deserve that. I don't deserve this. And I hope you all know that I am alive and well and this should be sufficient for you all to end all the rumors,"" she said adding a statement that the Department of Defense handles casualty notifications and confirmed that no Virginia National Guard personnel were involved in the Black Hawk collision.Jo Ellis' social media posts were scanned after she was mistakenly identified as one of the pilots. Keen-eyed social media users found out that Ellis wrote many anti-Trump statements. ""Just ONE DAY before piloting the Blackhawk that collided mid-air with a passenger jet over DC, transgender military pilot Joe Ellis appeared on the Michael Smerconish podcast. In the interview, Ellis expressed anger over Trump’s ban on trans service members, calling it a direct threat to a career in the military,"" one social media post claimed asking whether the DC crash was ""another trans terrorist attack"" and whether Ellis crashed into the jet on purpose.""So now we’re learning that the Pilot/Co-Pilot ‘female’ who was on the Blackhawk is actually a transgender who wrote a long letter ONE DAY PRIOR about “Gender dysphoria” and depression,"" another post read.Ellis is a Chief Warrant Officer and Black Hawk helicopter pilot who has served in the Virginia National Guard for 15 years, reports said. She served in combat zones in Iraq, along with other operations overseas. She serves in the military part-time, and also works as an IT engineer in the private sector.Ellis began her gender transitioning in 2023 while serving in the Army and claimed that everyone in her unit was very supportive.Though the investigation is on, prima facie the army helicopter is being blamed for taking a bizarre flight path deviating from its scheduled route and also altitude. President Donald Trump this morning took to Truth Social claiming that the Blackhawk was flying higher than its 200-ft limit. A New York Times report said the helicopter pilot even confirmed seeing the American Airlines plane and the air traffic controller asked the pilot to go behind the plane but it did not follow that.","Jo Ellis, a Blackhawk pilot, issued a statement that she was not there in the army helicopter that crashed in DC.

What is Kamala Harris doing now?



Many Republican commentators Friday shared a screenshot of a 404 page on former Vice President Kamala Harris . 404 error means the internet page is not available, and has been removed. The viral screenshot also had a statement which looked inspired by Kamala Harris. ""404. This page is unburdened by what has been. You have reached a broken link. Please return to the home page or use the navigation above,"" it was written. Unburdened is a favorite catchphrase of Kamal Harris as she used the word many times. Social media users including Donald Trump Jr claimed that it was done by the 'White House digital team'.Social media fake claims tried to pass the screenshot as of the White House, but the screenshot was from Kamala Harris' own website for her presidential election. One social media user said it was a page for the Kamala Harris-Tim Walz campaign which does not exist now. However, it's not clear whether any section of the site is leading to the 404 page or whether it was led by typing '404' in the URL.All eyes are on the former vice president for her next move as she has not announced anything. According to insiders, she never had a plan B as she was certain that she would win the election and is now thinking about her future moves. This is the first time Harris is not in a public role since 2004. She and her husband Doug Emhoff moved to Los Angeles while Emhoff has also taken up a new job as a partner of the legal firm Wilkie Farr &Gallagher LLP.As far as politics is concerned, Kamala Harris has two options: running for California Governor in 2026 and preparing to run again as the president in 2028. For many, the first option is now below her stature as the former VP and she would be preparing to contest in the presidential election again.","Many Republican commentators Friday shared a screenshot of a 404 page on former Vice President Kamala Harris. 404 error means the internet page is not available, and has been removed.

Vice President JD Vance defended President Donald Trump's DEI (diversity, equity, inclusivity) remark in the context of the fatal plane crash in Washington DC that killed 67 people leaving no survivors, and said that he was not blaming anyone in particular. Trump criticized the DEI practices and that led to air traffic controllers being short-staffed, Vance said in an interview on Fox News Channel.“The president made very clear that he wasn’t blaming anybody, but he was being very explicit about the fact that DEI policies have led our air traffic controllers to be short-staffed. That is a scandal. Thankfully, it’s a scandal that the president has stopped,” Vance said.Vance said it’s important to “investigate everything,” adding, “But let’s just say the person at the controls didn’t have enough staffing around him or her because we were turning people away because of DEI reasons.”“There is a very direct connection between the policies of the last administration and short-staffed air traffic controllers,” Vance said.A Washington Post report said that the Army helicopter that crashed into the American Airlines plane in midair was alerted about the passenger plane twice and the first alert was sent at least two minutes before the crash. One of the Black Hawk pilots requested visual separation so that the helicopter crew could maintain a safe distance from the plane which it confirmed that it could see. About 12 seconds after the second alert, the two aircraft collided.The National Transportation Safety Board investigating the crash said the pilot of the passenger plane may have attempted a last-second move to evade the collision. There was a slight change in altitude at the very last second but that did not save it from being hit by the army helicopter.Transport secretary Sean Duffy prohibited ""celebrations based on immutable traits or any other identity-based observances"" and called them distractions. ""Effective immediately, the Department of Transportation will no longer participate in celebrations based on immutable traits or any other identity-based observances. These distractions do nothing to keep planes in the air, trains on the tracks, or ports and highways secure.

Bilal Shabbir, Kalat’s deputy commissioner, said the attacks took place in Pidrang, Khazeni and Mangochar Bazaar areas of the town, where militants started conducting snap checks of passenger vehicles passing through town.In the first incident, Shabbir said a van carrying 17 soldiers from Panjgur to Quetta came under attack near the mountainous area of Khazeni, where armed men battled the security forces. He said one soldier of the Frontier Corps (FC), a paramilitary force, was separately killed in clashes with the militants.“The bodies of the slain soldiers were shifted to Quetta,” Shabbir said. “We don’t know how many attackers were killed because they took the bodies of their fighters into the mountains in the dark.”He said three FC personnel were also injured in the attack, adding that militants set a private bank on fire in Mangochar Bazaar.Separatist groups like BLA have long been at the forefront of a low-level insurgency in Balochistan, Pakistan's largest province by area and rich in mineral resources. Separatists claim that Islamabad is abusing the province’s natural wealth while ignoring the local population.In recent months, the BLA has become a major security threat, carrying out large-scale attacks in Balochistan and other parts of Pakistan, targeting Chinese nationals and interests engaged in investment projects, security forces, and ethnic Punjabis they perceive as outsiders in Balochistan.",At least 18 soldiers killed and five injured in Balochistan attacks.

A paramilitary who arrived to assist was also killed in the attack.Three others were critically injured, while two managed to escape unscathed.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack so far, but Balochistan has long been plagued by sectarian, ethnic, and separatist violence.The province, which borders Afghanistan and Iran, has seen a surge in attacks in recent months.In January, six people were killed in a bombing claimed by the separatist Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), which has frequently targeted security forces and civilians, particularly those from other provinces.The BLA has also attacked foreign-funded energy projects, including those backed by China, accusing outsiders of exploiting the province’s vast natural resources while neglecting local communities.In November, the BLA took responsibility for a bombing at Quetta’s main railway station that killed 26 people, including 14 soldiers. Just months earlier, in August, the group launched a series of coordinated attacks that left at least 39 people dead, marking one of the deadliest escalations in recent years.Violence has also surged beyond Balochistan, with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province witnessing an increase in militant attacks.The Pakistani military reported that in 2024 alone, 383 soldiers and 925 militants were killed in various clashes.","18 paramilitary personnel killed in ambush in southwest Pakistan's Balochistan province.

TikTok ban debate in US



A 15-year-old girl was shot dead by her father and maternal uncle in an alleged honour killing in Pakistan 's Quetta , after she refused to stop making TikTok videos , ARY news reported.The victim, identified as Hira, had been active on the social media platform, which enraged her father, Anwarul-Haq . After she refused to comply with his demand to stop creating content, he conspired with her maternal uncle, Tayyab Ali, to kill her, according to police.""Our investigation so far has found that the family had an objection to her dressing, lifestyle, and social gathering,"" another police investigator, Zohaib Mohsin, said. ""We have her phone. It is locked,"" he told Reuters. ""We are probing all aspects, including honour killing.""According to the authorities, Anwarul-Haq had moved to the United States with his wife and children several years ago.However, on January 15, he returned to Pakistan with Hira, while his wife and two other daughters remained in the US Police confirmed that the murder was premeditated, with both men confessing to the crime.The case has now been transferred to the serious crime investigation wing for further inquiry.Meanwhile, TikTok remains unavailable on Apple and Google app stores in the United States. US President Donald Trump has expressed support for approving the app, provided that the US owns 50% of it.""We need to save TikTok because we have to save a lot of jobs. We don't want to give our business to China... I agreed to approve TikTok on the condition that the USA will own 50 per cent of TikTok,"" Trump said.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has also weighed in on the debate, opposing a TikTok ban while specifying what he called an imbalance in global platform regulations.""I have been against a TikTok ban for a long time, because it goes against freedom of speech . That said, the current situation where TikTok is allowed to operate in America, but X is not allowed to operate in China is unbalanced. Something needs to change,"" Musk posted on X.On April 19, Musk reiterated his stance, saying, ""In my opinion, TikTok should not be banned in the USA, even though such a ban may benefit the X platform. Doing so would be contrary to freedom of speech and expression. It is not what America stands for.""","15-year-old girl was shot dead by her father and maternal uncle in an alleged honour killing in Pakistan's Quetta.

Baloch leader calls for solidarity against Pakistan's brutal oppression,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/baloch-leader-calls-for-solidarity-against-pakistans-brutal-oppression/articleshow/117628431.cms,"<p>Baloch leader Hyrbyair Marri (Image credits: ANI)<br></p>

LONDON: Baloch leader Hyrbyair Marri brought attention to the ongoing horrors that the Pashtun and Baloch communities endure under Pakistan 's repressive control in a stirring statement to the Pashtun National Council (Jirga). Marri brought attention to the Pakiststate's systematic exploitation, enforced disappearances, and violence against various ethnic communities.""The sufferings of the Baloch and Pashtun under Pakistan's occupation are countless and unending,"" Marri stated, emphasizing the urgent need for unity between the two nations to resist colonial oppression.He recalled previous instances of solidarity, such as the treaty of kalat in 1758, in which Afghan and Baloch leaders promised to respect and support one another. He asked both groups to rekindle this spirit in their struggle for independence.Marri compared British imperialism to the colonial strategies that Pakistan acquired. He denounced Pakistan's continuous military actions in Balochistan , pointing to unlawful executions, torture, and enforced disappearances as means of quelling dissent. The Baloch leader cited the targeted profiling of Pashtuns and killings like the 1948 Barbra event in Charsadda, claiming that these practices were continuations of the British heritage of divide and conquer.Recalling how Pashtun tribes were utilized as frontline combatants in 1948 while Punjabi elites remained behind, he also denounced Pakistan's abuse of Baloch and Pashtun youth. He also drew attention to the fact that thousands of Baloch youths were forcibly drafted into the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s and sent to die under pretences of religious salvation.Marri condemned Pakistan's racial profiling of Afghan refugees, primarily Pashtuns, and their forced deportation as a pressure tactic against Afghanistan. ""These people have lived here for generations, yet they are treated as disposable,"" he said.Calling for a renewed alliance between the Baloch and Pashtun nations, Marri declared, ""Our unity is the path to freedom. Together, we will break the chains of occupation and build a future rooted in justice, sovereignty, and peace.""","Baloch leader Hyrbyair Marri spoke to the Pashtun National Council (Jirga) Marri condemned Pakistan's systematic exploitation, enforced disappearances, and violence against various ethnic communities.
