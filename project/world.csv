MEERUT: Malkhan Singh , an IAF soldier, was 23 when an Antonov-12 aircraft, carrying 102 people, including him, went missing on Feb 7, 1968. It was later found crashed over Himachal's Rohtang Pass On Tuesday, when two Army officials came to Malkhan's old house in Fatehpur village in UP's Saharanpur district, informing the family about the recovery of his mortal remains - his wife died waiting for him for 32 years - there was silence at first.And then joy. And tears. It was overwhelming for everyone. The family was told to make arrangements for the last rites.He was too young for us to believe he was indeed dead. His wife spent her life thinking he was alive somewhere and would return one day. She had a newly born son when he went missing. She died sometime around 2000, carrying a lifelong hope and wait,” said Malkhan’s youngest brother, Isham Pal, now 65.“If the body had been found even 25 years ago, his wife would have rested in peace,” added cousin Vishwas Singh. The family said that ever since Malkhan disappeared, they never heard anything about him.“We lost all hope after running pillar to post searching for him,” Vishwas said. “When he couldn’t be traced for years, there was a ‘family adjustment’. Malkhan’s wife was married off to his brother Chandrapal Singh. Malkhan’s only son, Ram Prasad, had two sons, Gautam Kumar (22) and Manish Singh (16), and three daughters. Ram Prasad died in 2010. Malkhan’s parents, wife and only son passed away desperately waiting for closure.”Malkhan’s grandchildren, who grew up listening to stories about him, took part in his last journey on Wednesday as hundreds, perhaps more, joined in. “We are full of emotions,” said Gautam. The mortal remains reached Fatehpur in the afternoon, amid the huge crowd of mourners, and he was cremated later in the evening. Malkhan Singh had finally come home.","Malkhan Singh, an IAF soldier, was 23 when an Antonov-12 aircraft, carrying 102 people, including him, went missing on Feb 7, 1968.

Iran-Israel war: How big is Iran’s missile power and what is Israel’s defence system,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iran-israel-war-how-big-is-irans-missile-power-and-what-is-israels-defence-system/articleshow/113881116.cms,"Photo/Agencies

How dangerous is Iran’s ballistic missile arsenal

Israel's defence mechanism: Beyond the Iron Dome

The Middle East edged nearer to a wider regional conflict following Iran 's launch of ballistic missiles at Israel on Tuesday, sending almost 10 million people into bomb shelters as projectiles and interceptors exploded in the skies above.Israel said it has initiated restricted ground operations in Lebanon, focusing on the Iran-supported Hezbollah militia.According to Israeli sources, many of the missiles were intercepted, and US officials said that American destroyers contributed to Israel's defense.Iran claimed that the majority of its missiles reached their intended targets. No immediate reports of casualties were available.The attack came five months after a strike in April that was the first ever direct Iranian strike on Israel. Ballistic missiles are an important part of the arsenal at Tehran's disposal.To better understand the situation, it is crucial to examine Iran's ballistic missile arsenal and the defensive capabilities of Israeli forces:Iran possesses a significantly larger arsenal of artillery and Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS) compared to Israel. However, these weapon systems would need to be deployed near Israel's borders to be effective, as traditional artillery and MLRS with a range of 70-80 km cannot reach Israel from their current positions.Iran is also known to have a substantial number of short, medium, and long-range ballistic missiles capable of striking Israel. According to a 2021 report by the Missile Threat Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), Tehran has thousands of ballistic and cruise missiles with a variety of ranges.Ballistic missiles follow a trajectory that takes them outside or near the limits of Earth's atmosphere before the warhead separates from the rocket and descends onto its target. An analysis of Iran's extensive ballistic missile arsenal, considering guidance systems and range, reveals a significant threat to Israel, as Iran is believed to possess at least five different long-range ballistic missiles that can reach Israel from Iranian territory.Iran's Ballistic missile system includes primarily short-range and medium-range missiles, such as the Fateh, Sajjil, Shahab, Qiam, and Khorramshar. The short-range Shahab-2, with a range of up to 500 km, has been part of Iran's arsenal since 1998, while the Fateh-313, another short-range missile with a similar range, was incorporated into Iran's defense system in 2015.Medium-range missiles, capable of traveling 1,000 to 2,000 km, were introduced into Iran's defense program in 2003 with the Shahab-3. These missiles use liquid propellant, carry warheads weighing 760 to 1,200 kg, and can be launched from mobile launchers and silos. According to Iran Watch, the latest variants of the Shahab-3, the Ghadr and Emad missiles, have accuracies within 300 meters (almost 1,000 feet) of their intended targets.Iranian media reported that Tehran used a new missile, the Fateh-1, in Tuesday's attacks on Israel. This 'hypersonic' missile travels at Mach 5, or five times the speed of sound (6,100 km per hour).Israel's nuclear capabilities have been a topic of speculation for decades, as the nation maintains a policy of ambiguity regarding its nuclear arsenal. While the country has not officially confirmed or denied possessing nuclear weapons, it is widely assumed that Israel has a substantial nuclear stockpile.According to estimates from the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, Israel's nuclear arsenal likely consists of approximately 90 plutonium-based nuclear warheads. Furthermore, the country is believed to have produced sufficient plutonium to potentially manufacture between 100 and 200 nuclear weapons.Israel has a multi-layered missile defense system designed to intercept various types of threats, from ballistic missiles that reach high altitudes to low-flying cruise missiles and rockets.The Iron Dome, which has garnered significant attention for its effectiveness, is the lowest tier of Israel's missile defense and is primarily used to counter incoming rockets and artillery weapons. However, the Iron Dome was not the system employed to combat the ballistic missiles launched on Tuesday night, CNN reported.The next level of defense is David's Sling, a collaborative effort between Israel's RAFAEL Advanced Defense System and US defense giant Raytheon. This system protects against short- and medium-range threats, utilizing Stunner and SkyCeptor kinetic hit-to-kill interceptors to neutralize targets up to 186 miles away, as reported by the Missile Threat Project at the CSIS.Above David's Sling, Israel has the Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 systems, both developed in partnership with the United States. The Arrow 2 employs fragmentation warheads to destroy incoming ballistic missiles in their terminal phase, as they descend towards their targets in the upper atmosphere.According to the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, the Arrow 2 has a range of 56 miles and a maximum altitude of 32 miles, representing an upgrade from the US Patriot missile defenses Israel previously used in this role.The Arrow 3, on the other hand, utilizes hit-to-kill technology to intercept incoming ballistic missiles in space before they reenter the atmosphere on their way to targets.",Iran claims that the majority of its missiles reached their intended targets. The attack came five months after a strike in April that was the first ever direct Iranian strike on Israel. Iran has a significantly larger arsenal of artillery and Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS) compared to Israel.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113882984,imgsize-923977,width-400,resizemode-4/113882984.jpg"

Manipur a 'war of narratives' now: General Upendra Dwivedi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/manipur-a-war-of-narratives-now-general-upendra-dwivedi/articleshow/113861490.cms,"General Upendra Dwivedi

(With inputs from New Delhi bureau)

GUWAHATI: The ethnic conflict in Manipur has morphed into a ""battle of narratives "" driven by alleged falsehoods such as drones dropping bombs and 900 militants trained in Myanmar infiltrating the state for targeted attacks, Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi said Tuesday at an event in Delhi.""It all started in May 2023 with a rumour that an Anglo-Kuki war centenary gate was being burned down.It was not. I have been on the ground and confirmed it. Rumour-mongering led to major violence,"" he said at the second edition of Chanakya Defence Dialogue 2024, organised by Indian Army and Centre for Land Warfare Studies.The Army chief said that 16 months later, ""narratives"" were still being spun and given credence to by a section of the state government. ""So, if we control that (false narratives), I think things will be alright.""Referring to Myanmar's alleged assistance to Kuki militants in Manipur, the general said the neighbouring country had troubles of its own to contend with, leading to largescale civilian displacement.""When they are getting displaced, where will they go? They will only go to places that are peaceful and ready to accept them. And that is what is happening in Mizoram and Manipur. Those people who are coming, they are coming unarmed, they are coming for shelter. And India, the country we are, we will make sure that they are provided shelter, food and support till the time we can.""Last month, Manipur's security adviser Kuldiep Singh said the govt had received intelligence inputs about ""900 Kuki militants"" trained in Myanmar entering the state to attack villages in Imphal valley. He retracted the statement days later, saying that the inputs couldn't be substantiated.The N Biren Singh-led BJP govt had also reported a series of drone bombings targeting homes and IRB bunkers in the valley in Sept. ""We went on the ground and checked. There was no drone bombing,"" the Army chief said.Gen Dwivedi said Manipur's ""society"" was weaponised at the peak of the conflict, with mass looting of armouries taking place at various places. Around 25% of looted weapons have been seized along with double the number of countrymade arms in the hands of civilians.""There is polarisation between communities,"" the Army chief said. ""The situation may be stable today, but it is tense. We are trying to calm the situation. We are also trying to restore the trust...When such social fracturing takes place, it takes time to kind of recover.""A ""whole-of-nation approach"" is required in Manipur, where over 230 have been killed in the violence since May last year, the general said.","The ethnic conflict in Manipur has morphed into a ""battle of narratives "" driven by alleged falsehoods.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday reiterated its stance on ' bulldozer justice ' and said that mere accusations or even conviction of heinous crime can't be ground for demolition of property.""We are going to make it clear that merely because somebody is an accused or convict, it can't be a ground for demolition,"" the top court said.The bench of Justices B R Gavai and K V Viswanathan, however, observed that there can't be a different law for a particular religion, the bench said it will not protect any unauthorised constructions on public roads, government lands or forests.""We will take care to ensure that our order does not help the encroachers on any of the public places,"" the bench said.""If there are 2 structures in violation and action is taken only against 1.

Raising serious concern over bulldozers being used as a punitive tool, which SC said was against the ethos of the Constitution and needed to be subjected to ""judicial oversight"", Justices B R Gavai and K V Viswanathan said there was apprehension of its misuse by the executive, which could not act as the judge.The term 'Bulldozer justice,' as referred to by the public, is a form of instant justice mechanism involving the razing of houses, shops, or any premises belonging to individuals accused of a crime.Two aggrieved house owners from Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh approached the Supreme Court against their respective states for demolishing their homes and sought urgent hearings. In the Rajasthan case, a house was razed due to an alleged offense committed by the tenant's son, while in Madhya Pradesh, a bulldozer was used to demolish a joint family's ancestral house.","Justices B R Gavai and K V Viswanathan said there can't be a different law for a particular religion.

Like Epstein list, a list of names, all celebrities, with links to P Diddy and his Freak off sessions, are doing the rounds on social media. The alleged list contains names of Leonardo Dicaprio , Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Ashton Kutcher, Paris Hilton, Howard Stern, Russell Brand, Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez, Russell Simmons, Usher, Meghan Fox. The list goes viral as Usher, Pink deleted their X posts and theories that Justin Bieber might have been a victim of Diddy float around.Nobody has been implicated in the Sean Combs case so far.P Diddy is facing serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering where he forced women to have sex with male prostitutes that continued for days as the entire action was caught on camera. Huge stocks of baby oil, drugs were found at Diddy's sex den while Diddy did not plead guilty to the charges.Usher who once stayed with Diddy said his X account got hacked and that's why all his past posts disappeared. This happened as his old statement in which said he witnessed wild things when he stayed with Diddy resurfaced.Apart from Usher and Pink, Megan Fox deleted all her posts on Instagram and X triggering speculations over how she was linked to Diddy.An old snipped of Khloe Kardashian claiming that she attended one of Diddy's naked parties emerged. ""I got on a plane at 5:30 am. Well this party...I think half the people there were butt naked,"" this is exactly what Khloe said about Diddy's party.Diddy was Justin Bieber's mentor but Bieber's spokesperson said he is trying not to focus on the charges and accusation of Diddy. Justin is in a happy bubble since he became a father.As the list of the Hollywood A-listers becomes long, they are maintaining absolute silence over Diddy's arrest.An officer involved in the raid on Diddy's home compared him to Jeffrey Epstein, stating that Diddy was part of the same social circle as Epstein and Harvey Weinstein. The officer claimed there were 15 years of wild parties, suggesting that while not everyone who attended was complicit in trafficking, they witnessed inappropriate behavior. He emphasized that many people knew what went on, especially as things became more explicit late at night.Also read on the Diddy case:","No Hollywood A-lister has been implicated in the Sean Diddy trafficking case but several 'Diddy lists' are viral.

Former US President and Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump has raised over $160 million in the month of September, according to Trump’s campaign . This amount is 23 per cent more than what Republicans managed to raise in the previous month, which was around $130 million.As a result of this successful fundraising , Trump's campaign now has a cash reserve of around $283 million.Meanwhile, Trump’s counterpart in this election, Kamala Harris managed to get past the amount collected by the former President for the month of August. The Democratic Presidential nominee and her party raised $361 million, which gave an edge to the US vice president’s party.Official figures for the amount collected in the month of September have not been disclosed by the Harris’ campaign. However, the US Vice President’s party managed to raise $55 million this past weekend from two events, informed a campaign official on Sunday.The entry of Kamala Harris in the Presidential race against Trump revoked a new sense of energy in the Democratic party , which seemed quite nervous and clueless when Biden was in the race.Earlier, the polls were showing a clear lead to Republican candidate Trump, even in the battleground states attributed to a sympathy wave after surviving an assassination attempt and Biden’s deteriorating cognitive health, Trump’s re-election seemed like a cakewalk until Biden stepped out on July 21 and endorsed Kamala for the post.Her entry has now tilted the scenarios building up during the time of Biden’s nomination, as now polls are showing a tight race between the Republican candidate and the Democratic candidate.Both sides are now focusing on the swing states to manoeuvre in their favour with aggressive ad campaigns.","Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump has raised over $160 million in the month of September.

The man and his girlfriend were then taken to a specialist clinic for further evaluation and treatment.Marburg virus disease is a highly dangerous illness that can lead to severe hemorrhagic fever , with a mortality rate that can reach up to 88%. It belongs to the same viral family as Ebola virus disease and produces symptoms such as fever, headaches, vomiting, and diarrhoea. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), ""on average, the Marburg virus kills half of the people it infects.""The virus originates from prolonged exposure to mines or caves housing Rousettus bat colonies. Human-to-human transmission occurs through direct contact with infected bodily fluids, secretions, organs, or contaminated surfaces and materials.Marburg virus was first identified in 1967 when lab workers in Marburg, Frankfurt, and Serbia were infected with a previously unknown infectious agent.","A medical student and his girlfriend were quarantined and transported for further testing after they developed flu-like symptoms on a high-speed train.

'Steady stream of disinformation': Filing details evidence against 'increasingly desperate' Trump after 2020 election results,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/steady-stream-of-disinformation-insights-from-us-prosecutors-filing-on-an-increasingly-desperate-trump-after-2020-election-results/articleshow/113890417.cms,"A federal judge in Washington DC has unsealed a staggering 165-page document from Special Counsel Jack Smith offering insights into the high-stakes case against former President Donald Trump for alleged attempts to subvert the 2020 election results. This filing was made public just 34 days before Americans cast their ballots.With many Americans gearing up to decide whether to reinstate Trump in the White House, the contents of the filing provides a comprehensive outline of the prosecution’s case against Trump, detailing his actions and strategies aimed at overturning the election results—actions that prosecutors argue fall outside the protections of presidential immunity .The document alleges that Trump’s efforts to pressure Vice President Mike Pence not to certify the election were carried out in an unofficial manner, exempting them from the cloak of immunity typically given to a sitting president.The Associated Press reported that the filing contends that Trump had laid the groundwork for rejecting the election results even before the ballots were cast, telling advisers that in the event he held an early lead he would “declare victory before the ballots were counted and any winner was projected.""Throughout the filing, prosecutors depict Trump as a leader in a state of ""increasing desperation"", suggesting he resorted to deceit and manipulation to influence every stage of the electoral process.The document details a conversation that highlights Trump’s dismissive attitude towards the severity of the events unfolding on January 6, 2021. When informed that Pence had been evacuated from the Capitol due to the violent insurrection incited by Trump supporters, he reportedly replied, “So what?” Furthermore, when an aide warned him that a lawyer was unable to substantiate the false claims being made, Trump said, “The details don’t matter.”The filing also showcases Trump's calculated use of social media to disseminate misinformation about the election. Of the more than 1,200 tweets he sent during the weeks leading up to the insurrection, the majority revolved around unfounded claims of election fraud .Trump also promoted false assertions that Pence could reject electoral votes, despite being informed that the vice president lacked such authority. This “steady stream of disinformation,” prosecutors argue, culminated in Trump’s incendiary speech at the Ellipse on January 6, where he urged his supporters to march to the Capitol, setting the stage for the violent breach that followed.The filing references “forensic evidence” from Trump’s phone, aiming to provide further insights into his actions post-Capitol attack.In response, Trump and his campaign continue to vehemently deny any wrongdoing. A Trump campaign spokesperson labeled the brief as “falsehood-ridden” and unconstitutional, framing Smith’s investigation as a politically motivated attack. Trump himself took to his Truth Social platform, asserting that the case against him would ultimately end in his “complete victory.”","A federal judge in Washington DC has unsealed a 165-page document from Special Counsel Jack Smith offering insights into the high-stakes case against former President Donald Trump.

At one point, Acosta, visibly frustrated, interjected, ""What is this Kamala? It’s Kam-a-la Harris. Corey, you’ve been in this business a long time, I think you’re a mature grown-up. It’s Kam-a-la Harris. Can you just say Kamala? What’s going on there?""But Lewandowski’s refusal to comply led Acosta to abruptly end the interview.Earlier in the interview, Lewandowski and Acosta had engaged in a back-and-forth about the 2020 election , with Acosta pressing Lewandowski on why the Trump campaign continues to avoid acknowledging Trump’s defeat. “Why is it so difficult for the Trump campaign to answer a simple question—did Donald Trump lose the 2020 election?” Acosta asked, echoing a sentiment raised during a vice presidential debate between Minnesota governor Tim Walz and Ohio Senator JD Vance the previous night.Lewandowski, deflecting, responded, ""Jim, I think it’s very simple. The American people have moved past the 2020 election. They’re focused on an election just under five weeks away. What we have now is an opportunity to talk about two different visions for America, and what JD Vance laid out last night is a very different vision than what Tim Walz and Kamala Harris want to say.""Acosta, not letting the moment pass, jumped in. ""It’s not about relitigating the past. It’s a simple question: Did Donald Trump lose the 2020 election?"" Lewandowski, avoiding a direct answer, turned the conversation to economic issues, saying, ""Jim, why are we talking about 2020 anymore? Do the American people care about the 2020 election, or do they care about being able to put food on their table?""The interview also touched on other controversial topics, including immigration. Acosta also referenced a debunked claim by Trump and Vance that migrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating people’s pets. Lewandowski, in response, listed off statistics about immigrants, asserting, “13,099 murderers were let into this country,” in an apparent attempt to steer the conversation away.","CNN anchor Jim Acosta abruptly cut short an interview with Corey Lewandowski after the latter mispronounced Vice President Kamala Harris' name.

However, he quickly reverted to a more combative style afterwards, commenting on his opponent's verbal missteps.In response, Walz criticized Vance for not directly addressing the outcome of the 2020 election .During the debate, Walz asked Vance to state the winner, but Vance did not provide a clear answer. Walz said, ""The moment that really stuck out is, I just asked the simplest of all questions that every single American should be able to answer. I asked him if Donald Trump lost the 2020 election. He refused to answer.""The Minnesota governor described the debate as ""spirited"" but labelled Vance a ""slick talker"" who made false claims about Trump. Walz also targeted Vance's stance on the 2020 election, calling it ""disqualifying."" He said, ""Understand in that 88th minute last night, with that damning non-answer, Senator Vance made it clear: he will always make a different choice than Mike Pence made.""Despite being credited with a strong debate performance, Vance seemed to avoid discussing the 2020 election post-debate. Instead, he focused on criticising Harris for inflation during a speech in Michigan, only addressing the 2020 issue in a Q&A. He accused the media of being ""obsessed"" with the past election, saying, ""I'm focused on the election of 33 days from now because I want to throw Kamala Harris out of office and get back to commonsense economic policies.""Vance also mocked Walz for a reported comment about school shooters , suggesting that Walz misspoke about being ""friends with school shooters"". He quipped, ""probably only the third or fourth dumbest comment Tim Walz made that night.""The debate on Tuesday reached an estimated 43 million viewers, which was less than the 58 million who tuned in to watch Kamala Harris debate Mike Pence in 2020.

Israel's military recently conducted a significant airstrike targeting Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah using U.S.-supplied BLU-109 bombs with JDAM guidance kits. These 2,000-pound bombs, also known as ""bunker busters,"" are designed to penetrate fortified underground structures. The airstrike was captured in a video showing Israeli F-15i jets carrying out the mission, where the bombs were deployed to strike Hezbollah's underground command centre.This operation was part of Israel’s ongoing efforts to neutralise threats posed by Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran.As per reports, the U.S. has provided Israel with bunker buster bombs since 2005, with over 1,000 bombs included in a $6.5 billion military aid package in 2023. These bombs are equipped with delayed fuses, ensuring detonation only after penetrating the targeted bunkers.The strike resulted in the death of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrullah along with both military and civilian casualties, drawing international attention to the precision of Israel's military operations and the destructive capabilities of these advanced weapons.Bunker buster bombs, also known as ground-penetration munitions, are specialised weapons designed to destroy heavily fortified structures or underground bunkers. These bombs, weighing between 2,000 and 4,000 pounds, are loaded with explosives and equipped with delayed fuses to ensure they only detonate after reaching their target. They can penetrate up to 30 metres of earth or six metres of reinforced concrete, maximising structural damage through their impact and internal explosion.The concept of bunker busters originated during World War II, developed by German engineer August Coenders and tested between 1942 and 1943. However, these bombs gained prominence in modern warfare, particularly during the Gulf War, when precision-guided munitions became essential for targeting deeply buried enemy assets.: Developed during the Gulf War, this 5,000-pound bomb uses laser-guided technology for precision targeting.A GPS-guided bomb effective in adverse weather, capable of hitting deeply buried targets.: The largest bunker buster weighing 30,000 pounds, designed to penetrate up to 200 feet of reinforced concrete.Bunker busters bombs are equipped with advanced GPS or laser guidance systems for precise targeting, reducing collateral damage. Their strong casings allow the bombs to drill deep into hardened structures before detonating, making them ideal for targeting command centres, weapons depots, and other strategic locations.While bunker busters bombs are not banned by international law, their use in densely populated areas raises ethical concerns, particularly regarding potential civilian casualties. The Geneva Conventions emphasise avoiding unnecessary harm to civilians, making the deployment of such bombs controversial when used in urban environments.","Israel's military recently conducted a significant airstrike targeting Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah using U.S.-supplied BLU-109 bombs.

What is Iron Dome Israel used to protect civilians against Iranian missile attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/what-is-iron-dome-israel-used-to-protect-civilians-against-iranian-missile-attack/articleshow/113860422.cms,"AP photo

What exactly is Iron Dome

When was Iron Dome first put in use

How does Iron Dome work

Cost of Iron Dome

Who has made Iron Dome

How is Iron Dome different from an air defence system

Iran on Tuesday attacked Israel to avenge killings of top chiefs Hezbollah and Hamas -- proxy militant groups which Tehran backs in the Middle East to counter the United State and Israel.After the Khamenei regime launched over 100 rockets, including ballistic missiles near Tel Aviv, Israel, as usual, deployed the Iron Dome to safeguard its civilians against foreign hostility.According to a Congressional Research Service report, the Iron Dome is a mobile anti-rocket, anti-mortar and anti-artillery system that can intercept launches from 2.5 to 43 miles away, or 4 to 70 kilometres. It then sends information about the rocket’s path to the command-and-control centre.The Iron Dome is a series of batteries that use radars to detect incoming short-range rockets and intercept them. According to Raytheon , the US defence giant that co-produces the system with Israel's Rafael Defense Systems, each battery has three or four launchers, 20 missiles, and a radar.As of 2021, Israel is said to have at least ten Iron Dome batteries deployed throughout the country, each designed to defend a 60-square-mile populated area.Development on the Iron Dome first began in the year 2007. After tests in 2008 and 2009, the first Iron Dome batteries were deployed in 2011. Israel activated the Iron Dome in 2011. The system has been “tested consistently” since first being put to use in April 2011.The Iron Dome radar identifies an incoming rocket within its range, from the battery and sends information about the rocket’s path to the command-and-control centre. The control centre calculates the location of impact and predicts whether the rocket is going to strike inhabited areas.If so, it launches a missile to intercept and destroy the rocket. However, if the system determines that the rocket is headed to an open area or into the sea, it is allowed to land, thus conserving missiles. According to the military, all interceptions occur in Israeli airspace.Each missile is reported to cost an estimated $40,000 to $50,000, according to the Institute for National Security Studies , a Tel Aviv think tank. The US too has invested heavily in the system, helping with development costs and replenishing it during major conflicts.US President Joe Biden recently said that he will ask Congress for $14.3 billion in military aid for Israel. “We’re surging additional military assistance, including ammunition and interceptors to replenish Iron Dome,” Biden said.Iron Dome has been developed by Israel-owned Rafael Advanced Defense Systems with US backing.Unlike air defence systems designed to stop ballistic missiles, the Iron Dome warhead targets unguided rockets that remain at low altitudes. These are reported to be the type often fired by militant groups in Gaza.","The Iron Dome is a series of batteries that use radars to detect incoming short- range rockets and intercept them.

JD Vance’s net worth



JD Vance's political rise and evolving stance on Trump



JD Vance 's story is one of resilience, shaped by his childhood in Middletown, Ohio, and summers spent in Jackson, Kentucky. At 40, he stands on the brink of becoming the youngest vice president since Nixon. His military service in the Marine Corps, where he served as a public affairs officer in Iraq, deepened his sense of duty and informed his political views.Gaining national attention with his 2016 memoir, "" Hillbilly Elegy ,"" Vance candidly explored the challenges of his upbringing, offering insight into the socio-economic struggles of Appalachia, which paved the way for his political career and shifting stance on former President Trump.JD Vance was raised in Middletown, Ohio, and spent summers with extended family in Jackson, Kentucky. His upbringing in these areas significantly influenced his perspectives. Vance turned 40 on August 2. If elected, he would become the youngest vice president since Richard Nixon. After high school, Vance joined the Marine Corps and served as a public affairs officer in Iraq, adding a layer of depth to his political identity.Vance married Usha Chilukuri Vance in 2014 after meeting at Yale Law School. Usha is a former litigator who left her job following Vance’s nomination for vice president. The couple has three young children: Ewan (7), Vivek (4), and Mirabel (2). Their family dynamics play an important role in Vance’s public image. Vance and his family live between Cincinnati, Ohio, and Alexandria, Virginia, reflecting his commitment to both his home state and his political responsibilities. Vance’s mother, Beverly Aikins, has been a significant figure in his life. Raised in Middletown, she is now 10 years sober, a journey Vance often highlights in his speeches. Aikins has travelled with him on the campaign trail, sharing her story to inspire others facing similar challenges.Vance gained national recognition with his memoir, ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" published in 2016. The book offers a candid look at his turbulent childhood, including his mother’s struggles with addiction and the profound impact of his grandmother, whom he refers to as Mamaw. It has served as a lens through which many understand the socio-economic issues affecting the Rust Belt and Appalachia.

Will Biden support a decision to strike Iran's nuclear facilities? What the US President said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/will-biden-support-a-decision-to-strike-irans-nuclear-facilities-what-the-us-president-said/articleshow/113890725.cms,"US President Joe Biden (File photo)

'Won't Support Israel If...' Biden Opposes Israel Destroying Iran’s Nuclear Sites

US President Joe Biden on Wednesday rejected the possibility of supporting an Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear facilities in retaliation for the missile attack launched by Iran on Israel. “The answer is no,” Biden told reporters when asked about backing such a move, following Iran’s launch of approximately 200 missiles at Israel on Tuesday.“All seven of us agree that they have a right to respond, but they should respond in proportion,” Biden reiterated as he boarded Air Force One to tour the damage caused by Hurricane Helene in the Carolinas.""We will be discussing with the Israelis what they are going to do,"" Biden said when a reporter asked whether he would support a decision to strike Iran's nuclear facilities, Biden said he would consider that a step too far. Meanwhile Joe Biden said that, he planned to speak with Netanyahu ""relatively soon.""Biden’s remarks followed a teleconference with leaders from the Group of Seven (G7) nations, including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom, during which they coordinated new sanctions against Iran. The G7 leaders condemned Iran’s attack and expressed their solidarity with Israel's right to defend itself.The Biden administration has consistently urged caution, concerned that any Israeli strike on Iran’s nuclear program could trigger a wider regional conflict. “They should respond in proportion,” Biden stressed, highlighting the need for restraint in the escalating Middle East tensions.Tuesday's missile attack marked Iran’s second direct assault on Israel in six months, following a similar barrage in April. US military forces assisted Israel in defending against both attacks. Despite the heightened tensions, some analysts suggest that Israel may be less inclined to escalate the conflict into a broader confrontation with Iran.However Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has yet to decide on a course of action, with options ranging from symbolic retaliatory strikes to more aggressive measures, including targeting Iran’s nuclear facilities. However, Biden’s opposition underscores the administration's concern about the risks of large-scale military action.Secretary of State Antony Blinken and other US officials continue to engage with their Israeli counterparts, stressing the need to avoid actions that could further inflame the situation.While some US officials believe Israel is less eager for a major confrontation compared to April, when the Biden administration successfully persuaded Israel to limit its military response, there are concerns that Israel may still take more forceful action against Iran.Simultaneously, Israel is engaged in military operations against Hezbollah forces in Lebanon.In recent weeks, Biden administration officials warned Netanyahu that the conflict with Hezbollah could spiral into a broader regional war, potentially involving Iran, the US, and other countries. However, Netanyahu has continued an aggressive military campaign in Lebanon, despite international calls for a ceasefire.Netanyahu's decision to approve the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah further heightened tensions, even as the US and other nations called for de-escalation between Israel and Lebanon.According to The New York Times, a senior US official said the Biden administration understands that Israel’s clash with Hezbollah is “local and targeted” and does not aim to escalate into a larger conflict or territorial invasion.","'Won't Support Israel If...'

Multiple women from anti-vax group allege romantic ties with Robert F Kennedy Jr after Nuzzi scandal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/multiple-women-from-anti-vax-group-allege-romantic-ties-with-robert-f-kennedy-jr-after-nuzzi-scandal/articleshow/113889286.cms,"At least three women have recently come forward, alleging that they had romantic relationships with Robert F Kennedy Jr in the past year, according to a report by Mediaite.The women reportedly connected with Kennedy through the Children’s Health Defense , an organization he chairs that is known for its anti-vaccine stance. These allegations come on the heels of a highly publicized “emotional and digital affair” between Kennedy and New York Magazine reporter Olivia Nuzzi , who is nearly 40 years younger than the former presidential candidate.The revelation of these new allegations adds another layer to an already turbulent narrative surrounding Kennedy’s personal life. His camp has vehemently denied the claims, issuing a statement to Mediaite that characterized the reports as “untrue.”The details of relationship with Kennedy were disclosed through a series of text messages from the women, sparked by news of his relationship with Nuzzi.The Daily Mail reported that the friends of Kennedy’s wife, actress Cheryl Hines , suggest that she may soon file for divorce, potentially prompted by the public scrutiny surrounding her husband’s romantic entanglements. However, Page Six reported that if Hines decides to end her marriage to Kennedy, it may stem more from his connections with figures like Donald Trump than his relationship with Nuzzi.In a bid to quell the controversy, Kennedy’s spokesperson asserted, “Mr. Kennedy has had no romantic relationships with any woman other than his wife since their marriage.”Interestingly, Kennedy has been on leave from his role as chairman and chief legal counsel of Children’s Health Defense since April 2023, as noted on the organization’s website.The implications of these allegations extend far beyond Kennedy's personal life. They could create significant challenges for Donald Trump's presidential campaign, which Kennedy endorsed after withdrawing from his own bid for the White House. While Trump has attempted to distance himself from the controversy, the growing scandal surrounding Kennedy may become an unwanted distraction from Trump.","The women reportedly connected with Kennedy through the Children’s Health Defense, an organization he chairs that is known for its anti-vaccine stance.

Doctor pleads guilty in 'Friends' star Matthew Perry's death due to drug overdose,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/doctor-pleads-guilty-in-friends-star-matthew-perrys-death-due-to-drug-overdose-ketamine-queen-depression/articleshow/113889172.cms,"San Diego doctor Mark Chavez became the third person to plead guilty in the investigation surrounding Matthew Perry ’s tragic death. Dr Chavez, 54, on Wednesday took the first step in cooperation with federal prosecutors , agreeing to a plea deal that could prove pivotal in targeting larger figures believed to be responsible for Perry’s demise.The “Friends” star, who played Chandler Bing, was found dead in October 2023 from a drug overdose that has now sparked a wide-reaching investigation into the illegal distribution of ketamine .The case exposed the chilling reality of how an off-label treatment for depression spiraled into a lethal cocktail. Perry, who had battled addiction for years, sought refuge in ketamine therapy—a controversial, yet increasingly common treatment for depression. However, as his dependency grew, so did his desperation. When his legal sources dried up, Perry turned to the dark underbelly of the medical world, allegedly aided by Dr Salvador Plasencia and notorious Los Angeles dealer Jasveen Sangha, known as the “ketamine queen.”Dr Chavez, standing before US District Judge Sherilyn Peace Garnett, admitted his role in this dangerous network. His admission came as prosecutors recounted how he conspired with Plasencia to distribute ketamine to Perry through fraudulent prescriptions.Chavez, who once took an oath to do no harm, found himself supplying over 22 vials and nine lozenges of the powerful anesthetic. It was this very drug that Perry's assistant would find beside the actor’s lifeless body that fateful October day.“Are you pleading guilty because you did the things the prosecutors described?” Judge Garnett asked Chavez.“Yes, your honor,” he replied.The plea agreement Chavez signed in July binds him to cooperate fully as federal prosecutors continue to build their case against Plasencia, the doctor who allegedly delivered the fatal doses, and Sangha, the woman whose reputation as a drug supplier looms large in Los Angeles. Their roles, prosecutors argue, were far more sinister, as they preyed on Perry's vulnerability in his final months. US Attorney Martin Estrada, during a press conference in August, pointed to their exploitation of Perry’s history of addiction, providing him with “amounts they knew were dangerous.”Plasencia and Sangha are the ultimate targets. Text messages between Plasencia and Chavez, revealed in court filings, shed light on the extent of their illicit operations. In one exchange, Plasencia mused about how much Perry might pay for the drugs, calling the actor a “moron” and suggesting that they make themselves his go-to suppliers. Chavez, while hesitant at first, seemed to approve—so long as they stayed away from “shady stuff"".Chavez remains free on bond until his April 2 sentencing, having surrendered his passport and medical license as part of the agreement.Outside the courtroom, Chavez’s lawyer, Matthew Binninger, spoke briefly, signaling that his client had come to terms with his role in the tragic chain of events. “Mark entered his plea of guilty and that’s now public record,” Binninger said. “You accept responsibility and then you set sentencing,” he said.","San Diego doctor Mark Chavez is the third person to plead guilty in the investigation surrounding Matthew Perry's tragic death.

According to CBS News , the incident occurred on September 24, and authorities have condemned the act of violence against the 13-month-old dog.According to the Genesee County sheriff’s office, Josie was greeting individuals throughout the jail when Romello Maxwell struck her.Sheriff Chris Swanson reported that Josie suffered a concussion and scrapes to the inside of her pupil but is expected to recover.During a news conference on Tuesday, the sheriff shared surveillance footage of the incident, which showed Josie approaching Maxwell, who was lying on the ground before he punched her. The video ended with another inmate appearing to confront Maxwell in response to the attack.""We're going to hold people accountable.

Donald Trump: 'Details don't...': Judge unseals filing detailing Trump’s attempts to overturn 2020 election,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/details-dont-judge-unseals-filing-detailing-trumps-attempts-to-overturn-2020-election/articleshow/113886435.cms,"Former US President Donald Trump

Judge Tanya Chutkan has unsealed portions of a filing from prosecutors that argue for the continuation of the case against former US President Donald J Trump, despite the Supreme Court ’s recent ruling on presidential immunity . The special counsel, Jack Smith , contends that Trump is not shielded from prosecution on federal charges related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election , according to the New York Times .The disclosed brief adds crucial details to the extensive record regarding Trump’s attempts to retain power after losing the election. Among the revelations is a social media post Trump made on January 6, 2021, the day of the Capitol attack. In the post, he said that vice president Mike Pence had “let them all down.” Smith argues that this post should be seen as an act of a desperate candidate rather than an official act of a sitting president, which would typically warrant immunity under a landmark Supreme Court ruling from this summer.As the Capitol riot unfolded, an aide entered the Oval Office to inform Trump of the situation, hoping he would act to ensure Pence’s safety. Instead, Trump reportedly responded, “So what?” This exchange was also revealed through grand jury testimony included in the brief.The document also noted that Trump had previously received “an honest assessment” from one of his lawyers, who informed him that his claims of widespread fraud in the election would likely not hold up in court. Trump said, “The details don’t matter.”Additionally, the brief recounts a private lunch in mid-November 2020, during which Pence urged Trump to accept his election loss and consider running again in 2024. Trump’s response, “I don’t know, 2024 is so far off,” indicates his unwillingness to confront the reality of his defeat.Smith's 165-page brief was filed under seal last week to assist Judge Chutkan in determining which parts of the indictment could withstand the Supreme Court’s ruling granting Trump immunity for many official acts during his presidency. Prosecutors asserted that Trump's conduct was not official but rather a private scheme to overturn the election, saying, “Although the defendant was the incumbent president during the charged conspiracies, his scheme was fundamentally a private one.”The brief serves not only a legal purpose but also functions as a trial brief, presenting Smith’s comprehensive findings from nearly two years of investigation into Trump’s actions surrounding the election. The filing was accompanied by a sealed appendix containing FBI interviews, search warrant affidavits, and grand jury testimony.","Judge Tanya Chutkan unsealed portions of a filing from prosecutors that argue for the continuation of the case against former US President Donald J Trump.

Former White House aide Alyssa Farah Griffin accused senator JD Vance of “straight up lying” about Donald Trump ’s stance on Obamacare , a healthcare reform law, during a discussion on The View following Tuesday’s vice presidential debate , according to the Daily Beast.Griffin, who served as a communications official during Trump’s administration, refuted Vance’s claims that Trump attempted to salvage the Affordable Care Act .“When [Vance] said Trump tried to save Obamacare, I was on Capitol Hill and we were trying to repeal Obamacare,” she said, remarking on her firsthand experience of the Republican agenda . “I’m willing to admit what we were trying to do as Republicans.”Vance had asserted that Trump could have “destroyed the programme” but instead “worked in a bipartisan way to ensure that Americans had access to affordable care.” Griffin strongly disagreed, calling his comments a blatant falsehood. Co-host Joy Behar weighed in, calling on Vance’s “slickness” and comparing him to a seller of counterfeit luxury bags. She noted she had never witnessed such “straight-faced” lying, suggesting that Trump might feel “jealous” of Vance’s ability to maintain composure while delivering similar talking points.Despite her criticism of Vance’s honesty, Griffin acknowledged that he outperformed governor Tim Walz during the debate. “From a performance and delivery perspective, Tim Walz had the rockier night,” she commented. “JD Vance strategically went in to do midwestern nice to disarm Tim Walz, and Tim Walz kind of took the bait. He wasn’t in fighting mode.”Griffin pointed out that Walz missed opportunities to capitalise on key moments during the debate. However, she maintained that Vance’s performance did not alter her opinion of him. “Performance-wise, [Vance] is eloquent; he can feign empathy,” she said.","Former White House aide Alyssa Farah Griffin accused JD Vance of ""straight up lying"" about Donald Trump's stance on Obamacare.

Taliban blame Pak after 'capture of key IS fighters',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/taliban-blame-pak-after-capture-of-key-is-fighters/articleshow/113832418.cms,"KABUL : Taliban authorities captured ""key members"" of the Islamic State terror group responsible for recent deadly attacks across Afghanistan, a spokesman said Monday, blaming neighbouring Pakistan for harbouring the organisation. Security has generally improved since Taliban surged back to power in 2021, however the regional chapter of the group, known as Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K), has emerged as the main challenge to their rule.A sweeping security crackdown broadly quashed the number of domestic attacks but there was a string of shootings and bombings by IS-K this summer.Taliban govt spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said ""special forces"" apprehended ""key members of the insurgent group"" which claimed a Kabul suicide bombing that killed six people this month. He said the suicide attacker ""infiltrated Afghanistan"" from a training camp in Pakistan, while others arrested in a series of raids had also ""recently returned"" from there. Mujahid said the crackdown evicted the Sunni jihadist group from Afghanistan but they ""have established new operational bases and training camps"" in Pakistan.The comments are likely to further fray ties between Kabul and Islamabad.
