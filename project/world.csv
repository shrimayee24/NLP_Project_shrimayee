"SC to courts: Show courage, drop cases before trial if proof not strong",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-to-courts-show-courage-drop-cases-before-trial-if-proof-not-strong/articleshow/128285342.cms,"NEW DELHI: Criminal proceedings bring strain and social stigma, the SC said on Thursday, urging courts, particularly trial courts, to show “clarity and courage” to discharge an accused at the framing of charges itself when the material on record fails to make out a prima facie case.A bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and N K Singh said that judicial process itself should not become a punishment, and the courts must remain alive to the human consequences of their decisions and to the trust society places in them. The court passed the order while discharging a person under SC/ST Act after it found that ingredients of the offence under the special law was not met but it allowed trial court to proceed for offences under IPC.The top court said charges are to be framed only if the court forms an opinion that there is a ground for presuming that the accused has committed an offence and said HCs should also apply their mind on discharge plea and not to reject it mechanically.“...at the stage of framing of charge or considering discharge, the court is not dealing with an abstract legal exercise. It is dealing with real people, real anxieties and the real weight of criminal prosecution.Judicial responsibility at this stage calls for care, balance, and an honest engagement with the facts on record. The power to frame a charge is not meant to be exercised by default or out of caution alone. When the material placed before the court, taken at face value, does not disclose the ingredients of an offence, the law expects the court to have the clarity and courage to say so and to keep such a case aside,” Justice Karol, who wrote the judgment for the bench, said. The bench said discharge is not a technical indulgence “but an essential safeguard”.“The court must consciously distinguish between a genuine case that warrants a trial and one that rests only on suspicion or assumption or for that matter without any basis. To allow a matter to proceed despite the absence of a prima facie case is to expose a person to the strain, stigma, and uncertainty of criminal proceedings without legal necessity. Fidelity to the rule of law requires the court to remember that the process itself can become the punishment if this responsibility is not exercised with care,” it said.The bench said the responsibility weighs the heaviest on trial courts.“For a litigant or an accused, the trial court is not just one level in a hierarchy. It represents the face of the judiciary itself. The sensitivity, fairness, and legal discipline shown at this stage shape how ordinary citizens understand justice. The impression a trial court creates, through its approach to facts and law, often becomes the impression people carry of the entire judicial system. That is why, at every stage and especially at the threshold, trial courts must remain alive to the human consequences of their decisions and to the trust that society places in them,” it said.",The top court said charges are to be framed only if the court forms an opinion that there is a ground for presuming that the accused has committed an offence.

"Centre rejects Sixth Schedule, statehood for Ladakh, offers council",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-rejects-sixth-schedule-statehood-for-ladakh-offers-council/articleshow/128273026.cms,"JAMMU: The Centre has made it clear that Ladakh will not be granted Sixth Schedule status or statehood, two key demands of Leh Apex Body (LAB) and Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA), the region’s two major political organisations said after talks in New Delhi last week.The Sixth Schedule of the Constitution allows special administrative arrangements for tribal areas to safeguard autonomy, culture and land. Speaking publicly for the first time after the Feb 4 talks with a Union home ministry (MHA) high-powered committee, Ladakh leaders said the Centre had instead offered a “territorial council” model.Under this proposal, chief executive councillor of Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDC) will be designated as CM and the deputy chief executive councillor as deputy CM.“We call it a farce. LAB and KDA rejected it (the offer), except for one KDA member, Kunzes Dolma,” KDA co-chairman Asgar Ali Karbali said at a gathering in Kargil on Wednesday.According to Karbali, Dolma had earlier supported KDA’s agenda and was nominated as a member for the talks. “She told the high-powered committee that a conspiracy was hatched to remove her and that she is satisfied with the Union Territory status for Ladakh.We will not tolerate anyone, whether Dolma or anyone else, who plays with Ladakhi identity,” Karbali said.As Karbali spoke, many in the Kargil gathering raised slogans against Dolma and chanted support for Sonam Wangchuk, LAB member and climate activist jailed over violence in Sept 2025 during statehood protests in Leh.After the talks negotiations with the MHA committee headed by junior Union home minister Home Nityanand Rai, Karbali and Ladakh Buddhist Association (LBA) president Tsering Dorje Lakrook had described the talks as inconclusive.“When we reiterated Sixth Schedule status and statehood, they (MHA officials) argued that the Sixth Schedule has become ‘defunct’ and largely powerless. We disagreed. Supreme Court has repeatedly held Sixth Schedule as a law in itself and a strong constitutional safeguard. If it is powerful in the Northeastern states, why is it suddenly being called weak for Ladakh?” Karbali said.On statehood, Karbali said the MHA’s main objection was that Ladakh lacks sufficient financial resources. “When we asked that our legal experts be allowed to explain this, we were told they could not be called into the meeting. There is no Indian state that has every resource within its own territory,” Karbali argued.He reiterated the LAB and the KDA remain united in pressing for Sixth Schedule status and statehood as their core demands.","The Centre has made it clear that Ladakh will not be granted Sixth Schedule status or statehood, the region’s two major political organisations said after talks in New Delhi last week.

Friends without benefits? Congress pushes back as Stalin terms power-sharing demand in Tamil Nadu a 'conspiracy',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tamil-nadu-elections-dmk-congress-friends-without-benefits-congress-pushes-back-as-stalin-terms-power-sharing-demand-a-conspiracy/articleshow/128253924.cms,"'To Remove Corrupt DMK': TTV Dhinakaran Meets Goyal As AMMK Rejoins NDA Ahead Of Tamil Nadu Polls

NEW DELHI: The Congress–DMK alliance in Tamil Nadu faced renewed strain on Thursday after Congress MP Manickam Tagore publicly pushed back against chief minister MK Stalin after he dismissed the power-sharing demands as a ""conspiracy"".Tagore, one of the most vocal proponents of a share in governance for Congress, questioned Stalin’s remarks in one-line post on X: ""How is it that seeking, in a spirit of friendship, a role (a share) in work to serve the people could be termed as conspiracy?"" The pointed response, accompanied by a thinking-face emoji, suggested that at least a section of the party is unwilling to soften its stand even after the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) leadership drew a clear red line.DMK chief Stalin on Wednesday firmly ruled out sharing power with allies, while insisting that the alliance with the Congress was ""intact"" and free of confusion. ""We also know that it will not work in Tamil Nadu; they (Congress) know it too. It is a problem created by some people. They are deliberately conspiring to see if there will be a rift in the alliance. We are not worried about it. Rahul Gandhi is not worried either,"" Stalin said.Emphasising continuity, the chief minister added, ""The DMK-Congress alliance is in harmony. What others are expecting will not happen,"" Stalin said.The DMK leadership has since doubled down on that position. Senior party leader and Tamil Nadu forests minister RS Rajakannappan struck a blunt note saying the party did not run on the strength of alliances. ""If they come, let them come; if they go, let them go. It is the chief minister’s preference,"" he said.Rajakannappan also invoked history to justify the DMK's stance. ""When Kalaignar won more than 100 seats, did he allow a share in governance? When the DMK is poised to win 150 seats, how can we give a share?"" he had asked at a recent event, reiterating that there would only be a ""Dravida model"" government under Stalin.Within the Congress, the signals are more mixed. While Tagore has argued that the question of whether Tamil Nadu should have a single-party or coalition government should be left to the people, the party’s state leadership has opted for caution. TNCC president K Selvaperunthagai said the chief minister had expressed his view and added, ""Every party has its own opinion. Our leaders voice their views. Everyone, including the AICC high command and the CM, will sit and discuss and take a good decision. "" He insisted that there was ""no opportunity"" for a crack in the alliance.Stalin's carefully worded response till now on power-sharing had asserted DMK dominance in the alliance while avoiding a direct confrontation with the Congress leadership. His recent comment has, however, put Congress leadership in a very uncomfortable spot.Political commentator Suguna Diwakar told TOI earlier that a large number of Congress functionaries were not very particular about share in power, and that party would remain with the DMK. “There is no strong demand from the Congress leadership for a share in power. None of the party top brass was adamant about their demand. Only stray voices such as AICC functionary Praveen Chakravarty and Congress MP Manickam Tagore made these demands,” he said. “At least now they are strong with 18 MLAs and if they join an untested player like Vijay they will be reduced to a minor party in the state,” said Suguna Diwakar.However, there's one more option.Politcal analyst TSS Mani said majority of Congress cadres and functionaries wish to go with the TVK. He told TOI that AICC general secretary KC Venugopal feels that TVK president Vijay has a considerable number of fans in Kerala as well as other southern states. ""Congress leaders feel that this support base will help the party in 2029,"" Mani said.The recent out-in-the-open tension between the DMK and the Congress has however given an ammunition to the Bharatiya Janata Party. The saffron party has claimed both allies were searching for an exit ahead of the 2026 assembly elections. ""DMK feels Congress is a waste luggage to carry, and Congress feels the DMK may not return due to anti-incumbency,"" BJP spokesperson Narayanan Tirupathy claimed, calling the situation a standoff with each side waiting for the other to blink.For now, both allies maintain that the partnership endures. Yet the increasingly public exchange of sharp words over power-sharing raised questions about how long the truce can hold as negotiations over seats and strategy for 2026 draw closer.","Congress MP Manickam Tagore publicly pushed back against chief minister MK Stalin.

"Muslim groups, Left, TMC oppose govt’s move to mandate recitation of all 6 verses of Vande Mataram",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/muslim-groups-left-tmc-oppose-govts-move-to-mandate-recitation-of-all-6-verses-of-vande-mataram/articleshow/128276596.cms,"NEW DELHI: The All India Muslim Personal Law Board on Thursday strongly objected to the central govt’s recent notification mandating the recitation of all six verses of ‘Vande Mataram’ at official functions and in schools before the National Anthem, Jana Gana Mana.The AIMPLB has termed the decision “unconstitutional and contrary to religious freedom” and demanded that the govt immediately withdraw the notification or else it will challenge it in the court. Both factions of prominent Muslim body Jamiat Ulama -i- Hind have also raised objections to the govt’s order.Meanwhile, Left parties like CPI(M) and CPI also came forward to oppose the MHA order. CPI(M) demanded that the govt “uphold the spirit of the Constitution and immediately withdraw this order”.The CPI(M) accused the BJP-led union govt of attempting to create an “unnecessary controversy concerning the national song and the national anthem with ulterior motives” and that the “BJP govt should not be allowed to play with such historic cultural symbols.”The Left party highlighted that “the Constitution of India clearly states in Article 51A(a) that it is the duty of every citizen to respect the national flag and the national anthem.After thorough deliberation, the constituent assembly adopted the statement made by President Rajendra Prasad concerning the national song, whose two stanzas only would be sung.”“Through its recent order, the govt seeks to include the remaining four stanzas, which the constituent assembly felt did not resonate the secular character of the Indian Republic,” the party added.CPI’s Rajya Sabha MP Sandosh Kumar P accused the govt of “cynically weaponising culture to polarise the people.” “Our position is clear: for us, the country comes first; for the BJP, elections come first,” he added.Referring to the ruling party at the Centre, he alleged that “it is deeply ironic that those who had no role in the freedom struggle and remained subservient to British colonialism now claim the authority to issue certificates of nationalism.”Trinamool Congress lashed out at the govt alleging that the BJP was “Bangla-Birodhi”. “And now, in an official notification, @HMOIndia has distorted the original lyrics of Vande Mataram penned by Rishi Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay in Anandamath,” the party alleged in a post on X.Elaborating on the reasons for opposition, AIMPLB general secretary, Maulana Mohammed Fazlur Rahim Mujaddidi, alleged that the MHA order was “unconstitutional, against religious freedom and secular values, contrary to Supreme Court judgment, and directly conflicting with the religious beliefs of Muslims.”“Whatever the political considerations behind implementing this decision ahead of the West Bengal elections, Muslims cannot accept it, as it directly conflicts with their faith,” he added.Maulana Mujaddidi said that, following Rabindranath Tagore’s advice and deliberations in the Constituent Assembly, it had been agreed that only the first two stanzas of Vande Mataram would be used. He said that “a secular government cannot forcibly impose the beliefs or teachings of one religion upon followers of other religions”.He added that the song was written in the context of Bengal and contains references to the worship and veneration of Durga and other deities.“A Muslim worships only one God, Allah, without partners, and Islam does not permit any form of associating partners with God,” the AIMPLB general secretary emphasised.“Therefore, the Board demands that the Central Government immediately withdraw the notification; otherwise, the Board will challenge it in the court,” he asserted.Jamiat Ulama - i - Hind president Maulana Arshad Madani described the govt order as “biased” that he alleged was “a conspiracy to snatch the religious freedom” granted to all citizens by the Constitution of India.He further alleged that the Central govt’s order on Vande Mataram was a “unilateral and coercive decision” and that it reflects “a systematic attempt to curtail the constitutional rights of minorities”.“Muslims do not prevent anyone from singing or playing “Vande Mataram”; however, some verses of the song are based on beliefs that portray the homeland as a deity, which contradict the fundamental belief of monotheistic religions. Since a Muslim worships only one Allah, forcing him to sing this song is a clear violation of Article 25 of the Constitution and several judgments of the Supreme Court,” he added.In a statement from the Maulana Mahmood Madani-led faction of Jamiat Ulama -i- Hind faction, its general secretary Maulana Hakimuddin Qasmi said, “If the majority community wishes to recite it, they are fully entitled to do so. However, making it mandatory for all citizens would amount to imposing restrictions on religious freedom,” he added.He stated that the Constitution of India guarantees every citizen the inalienable right to profess, practice, and propagate his or her religion, and to live in accordance with one’s faith and conscience. “Therefore, compelling any individual to recite a specific poem or composition that conflicts with his or her religious beliefs is contrary to the spirit and provisions of the Constitution,” he said.He further stated that “India is a pluralistic and multi-religious nation where constitutional supremacy and the principle of “unity in diversity” form the foundation of national integration. Any step that weakens this foundation cannot be in the interest of the country.”“The Muslims of India hold a unanimous and unequivocal position that any decision undermining religious freedom will not be accepted. We strongly urge the Government of India to review the said circular in light of constitutional provisions, judicial precedents, and the diverse social fabric of the nation, so that religious liberty, constitutional dignity, and social harmony may be preserved,” he added.","The All India Muslim Personal Law Board has strongly objected to the central govt’s recent notification mandating the recitation of all six verses of ‘Vande Mataram’ at official functions and in schools before the National Anthem, Jana Gana Mana.

LOP: Spoke truth in House, won’t back down

NEW DELHI: Congress’ Rahul Gandhi on Thursday said he spoke the truth in Parliament and will not back down even if BJP moves a privilege motion or files a police case against him.In a video, Gandhi said Congress and the country fought for food security, but PM Narendra Modi has betrayed the farmers by “selling out cotton, soybean, apple and fruit growers”. Foreigners have been trying for a long time to capture India’s agriculture market and Modi has opened the doors for them because “Donald Trump controls his reins”.He said farmers in the US have large, mechanised farms and receive govt subsidies, while Indian farmers have small landholdings without mechanised farming and don’t get MSP either.“File a case against me, abuse me, move a privilege motion. It does not matter. I spoke the truth in Parliament. You may not like it, but the country understands the truth. Whatever the govt may do, I am with the farmers and won’t back down. Congress is with the farmers. We won’t allow injustice,” Gandhi said.Congress MP and general secretary KC Venugopal said, “We are not bothered about any motions and if you want to hang us, we are ready for that also. We will continue to tell the truth in Parliament.”He said BJP had taken away Gandhi’s LS membership in 2023, but he bounced back with more votes in the next election.Venugopal also lashed out at Modi govt over removal of parts of Gandhi’s speech from Lok Sabha records. “Whatever Gandhi said is completely expunged from the records. Whatever Nirmala Sitharaman said, the same remarks were included in the records. Govt has double standards... This Parliament is running for the govt, not for the opposition,” he said.Saying that he spoke the truth in Parliament, Rahul Gandhi asserted he will not back down even if BJP moves a privilege motion or files a police case against him. BJP had taken away Rahul’s LS membership in 2023, but he bounced back with more votes, Congress general secretary K C Venugopal said, slamming the govt for expunging parts of Gandhi’s speech.

Parliament passes bill to bring legal clarity to labour issues,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/parliament-passes-bill-to-bring-legal-clarity-to-labour-issues/articleshow/128283847.cms,"NEW DELHI: Parliament on Thursday passed Industrial Relations Code (Amendment) Bill, 2026, seeking to bring legal clarity over labour issues. Both Houses passed the bill by voice vote, even as several opposition members described it as “anti-labour” and accused govt of favouring industrialists over workers while drafting the industrial relations code.BJP and its allies, on the other hand, strongly defended the bill terming it a “historic reform” for the welfare of labourers.Replying to a debate on the bill in Lok Sabha, labour minister Mansukh Mandaviya said the four labour codes implemented nearly three months ago give a guarantee of minimum wage. These codes also ensure compulsory issuance of appointment letters as well as uniform wages for the same work irrespective of gender, he said.Before the bill was passed by RS, leader of the opposition Mallikarjun Kharge said the four codes are a way to steal the rights of workers, and govt has joined hands with corporates to strangle labourers, by threatening job security and increasing working hours.Mandaviya dismissed all charges saying the bill was brought in for legal clarity and Modi govt is committed to protect labourers and workers, and save industries.He said trade unions and workers support it, but those who want to do politics only speak against it. These codes ensure equal wages and rights for men and women, he said.Congress’ Jairam Ramesh said Industrial Relations Code was passed in the din on Sept 23, 2020 by a voice vote. “Today we are amending, with retrospective effect, a law that was passed six years ago. This reflects a complete failure of govt, as this repealing of the old Act should have been done before the new law was passed,” he said.Ramesh said the most significant change being brought about by the amendments is going to enable “ease of firing” and there is “no ease of hiring”.Earlier piloting the bill in Rajya Sabha, Mandaviya said, “When Industrial Relations Code, 2020 was passed, three Acts were subsumed in that”. He informed the House that those laws were Trade Union Act, 1926; Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946; and Industrial Dispute Act, 1947.","Both Houses passed the bill by voice vote, even as several opposition members described it as ‘anti-labour’ Opposition accused govt of favouring industrialists over workers while drafting the industrial relations code.

To underscore fraternity was under strain, it referred to an incident in Uttarakhand in which a Muslim shopkeeper was being forced to remove the word “Baba” from the sign board.Earlier, a writ petition was filed in Delhi HC opposing the film starring Manoj Bajpayee and directed by Neeraj Pandey.

How events unfolded







BENGALURU: A 33-year-old software engineer has been sent for psychiatric evaluation after allegedly stabbing his parents to death inside their upscale villa in Bengaluru’s tech corridor.Police say the accused, Rohan Bhat, appeared mentally unstable and was making contradictory statements during questioning. He has now been referred to NIMHANS for assessment instead of being taken into police custody.The victims — former merchant navy captain Naveen Chandra and his wife, dentist Shyamala — were found with multiple stab wounds inside their home in Vignan Nagar, near HAL Township, on Wednesday morning.Officers from HAL Police Station arrested Rohan later that day.“Though circumstantial evidence points to Rohan’s involvement in the murder, what is evading clarity is the exact motive behind it,” a police officer said.“Rohan makes contradictory statements every now and then. Once, he claims his father refused to give him Rs 4 lakh for his new project. Then, he changes it, saying the fight broke out over changing his mobile number from the family package.Also, he was undergoing mood swings. So, we decided to question him once his younger sister arrives from the US,” he added.Based on a preliminary assessment, police believe Rohan could be suffering from schizophrenia, a serious mental health condition characterised by disorganised thinking or behaviour.The couple had returned to Bengaluru from Bhubaneswar on Monday evening after a 10-day trip.“Since his mother intimated him, Rohan came home to receive them.According to Rohan, he requested Naveen to fund his projects and Naveen refused.However, the fight broke out early Wednesday morning when Naveen was getting ready for a walk and Rohan repeated his demand. At one stage, Naveen shouted at Rohan, asking him to leave the house immediately.According to Rohan, his father hit him with the stock of an airgun,” an investigating officer said.Police say Rohan later used a kitchen knife to attack his parents. He has told officers he does not remember what happened.The violence came to light around 7.30am when neighbours heard commotion from the villa.Dr Madhavi Nair, who lives nearby, described what she witnessed, “I rushed out and found Naveen in the garden of the opposite house. He had multiple stab wounds. I saw Shyamala lying on the floor inside the house. She was not responding. I was told by my neighbour that their son, Rohan, was inside. I asked him to come out. He said he was hit on the stomach. Then, I went inside and checked on Shyamala. I could not feel a pulse,” she said.She also stated, “Shyamala had told me that Rohan had some psychiatric issues and was on medication.”The couple were taken to Manipal Hospital on Old Airport Road but were declared dead on arrival.","Rohan Bhat, 33, has been sent for psychiatric evaluation after allegedly stabbing his parents to death inside their upscale villa in Bengaluru’s tech corridor.

Shooter was transgender; mother had opposed anti-trans hate





An 18-year-old identified by police as Jesse Van Rootselaar carried out a deadly shooting in the Canadian town of Tumbler Ridge that left multiple people dead and many more injured on Wednesday.Canadian police said the violence began at a family home near the town. There, Van Rootselaar shot and killed her 39-year-old mother and her 11-year-old stepbrother.After those killings, she traveled to Tumbler Ridge Secondary School where she opened fire randomly.At the school, six people, a teacher and five students, were found dead by responding officers. Dozens more suffered gunshot injuries and were taken to hospitals. Police arrived after the first report of an active shooter and found Van Rootselaar dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound inside the school.Nine people died in total, including the shooter, school victims, and the shooter’s family.Jesse Van Rootselaar was born male and began transitioning six years ago and identified as female. Deputy Commissioner Dwayne McDonald of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police confirmed this at a news conference on Wednesday, according to USA Today.In the days following the mass shooting, a past social media video of Van Rootselaar’s mother, Jennifer Strang, went viral.In that video, Strang spoke about the harm caused by online hate and urged people to “do better” and not spread hateful comments about transgender children. In the clip, she warned that persistent online hostility could contribute to serious harm for young people.There is no official evidence linking that video or Strang’s views to her daughter’s actions on the day of the shooting. Canadian police and other authorities continue to investigate what led to this tragedy.Police also said Van Rootselaar had a history of mental health-related contacts with law enforcement in the years before the shooting. Officers had been called to her family’s home multiple times for mental health-related concerns, and at least once police seized firearms from the residence and later returned them. Authorities said she acted alone. They said there is no sign that she picked specific people to attack at the school. Investigators have not yet said why she carried out the shooting. The reason for the attack is still unknown.Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and other officials expressed deep sorrow and national mourning after the tragedy. They ordered flags at federal buildings flown at half-mast and offered condolences to victims’ families while investigators continue their work.","Jesse Van Rootselaar, 18, was born male and began transitioning six years ago and identified as female.

Foreign-born Americans to lose citizenship?

How Trump’s Gold Card Is Different From Green Card Explained; Masterstroke Amid Immigration Fight?

What is denaturalization? What are the grounds for that?

Lying on a naturalization application

Concealing criminal history

Hiding past immigration violations

Using a false identity





After illegal immigrants, the target of the Donald Trump administration is going to be legal immigrants who were not born on US soil. This target group is not any visa holders, neither Green Card holders but are naturalized citizens who were not born in the US. The US Citizenship and Immigration Services has been working silently on this for the past several months, NBC News reported. The USCIS has been sending experts to its offices around the country to find out if some citizens who were naturalized through these offices could be stripped of their citizenship.The goal of emphasizing naturalized citizens is to supply the office of immigration litigation with 100 to 200 possible cases per month, one of the people familiar with the plans told NBC. Denaturalization cases are rare as this could only happen when a person is found to have concealed criminal histories during their citizenship process.The new target of 100-200 cases per month is an aggressive push by the administration to empty out the country, while in President Trump's first term, a total of 102 such cases were reported. USCIS has decided to dedicate staff for this purpose and they are touring all offices. Since denaturalization is a long process and may not be proved in the court, the target has been kept high so that at least some cases materializeUSCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said the agency re.views cases of naturalized citizens when there is credible evidence that citizenship was obtained through fraud or misrepresentation.“We maintain a zero-tolerance policy towards fraud in the naturalization process and will pursue denaturalization proceedings for any individual who lied or misrepresented themselves,” he said. “We will continue to relentlessly pursue those undermining the integrity of America’s immigration system and work alongside the Department of Justice to ensure that only those who meet citizenship standards retain the privilege of US citizenship. ”Denaturalization is the legal process by which a government revokes a person’s citizenship after it was granted through naturalization. The most common grounds for denaturalization are:The US Department of Justice files a civil lawsuit if any of these conditions are found. The government has to prove that the person did not qualify for naturalization, as they suppressed facts. If the citizenship is revoked, the individual goes back to their previous immigration status -- Green Card holders in most cases. If there is no valid status, they may face deportation.",US Citizenship and Immigration Services has been working silently on this for the past several months.

Drew Brees issued a public apology in 2020

Commenting first and then issuing a public apology makes one question democracy, freedom of speech, and everything in between. Are we pushing free speech too far, or do we focus only on what we say in the public apology?What is the thin line between impulse in the comment and consequence in the apology? Let’s try to understand Taylor Armstrong’s comment and apology about Super Bowl LX halftime show headliner Bad Bunny The comment: “Were you entertained? I am embarrassed for the NFL and Apple for the Super Bowl halftime show totally in Spanish with a Cuban flag!!”The apology [some excerpts, check out the screenshot below for full disclosure]: “The Super Bowl is such a huge American tradition, and while I personally didn’t connect with the creative direction of this year’s halftime show, that doesn’t take away from the fact that Bad Bunny IS an American and that the Spanish language is a prominent aspect of American culture. Evidently, my lack of awareness of the Latin culture led me to mistaken the flag as Cuban. ”Sometimes, a comment comes from one’s heart, head, and soul. After facing backlash, people may feel compelled to apologize, but the apology rarely originates from that same place. Who can verify sincerity? The comment is out there, and the backlash follows. But as for the apology, who can guarantee its worth or genuineness?The hurt is done, and someone bears the brunt. The corrective measure that follows may quiet the backlash for a while, but the damage remains.The comment was said. It seems like a never-ending circle in the digital town square.Has anybody in the NFL ever apologized for a comment? Yes, Drew Brees, recently inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame Class of 2026, made a comment and apologized for it.Back in 2020, in an interview with Yahoo Finance, Brees said that he “will never agree with anybody disrespecting the flag of the United States of America or our country” in response to players kneeling during the anthem to raise awareness of social injustice, as Colin Kaepernick did in 2016.Brees was condemned by his then-teammates Cam Jordan, Michael Thomas, Emmanuel Sanders, and Malcolm Jenkins, as well as NFL leaders like Aaron Rodgers . Brees later apologized on Instagram.It included: “In an attempt to talk about respect, unity, and solidarity centered around the American flag and the national anthem, I made comments that were insensitive and completely missed the mark on the issues we are facing right now as a country.They lacked awareness and any type of compassion or empathy. Instead, those words have become divisive and hurtful and have misled people into believing that somehow I am an enemy. This could not be further from the truth, and is not an accurate reflection of my heart or my character.”","Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Taylor Armstrong made a comment and apology about Super Bowl LX halftime show headliner Bad Bunny.

Bangladeshi migrant avoids deportation from UK over 20-year jail sentence imposed under Sheikh Hasina’s regime in Dhaka,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/bangladeshi-migrant-avoids-deportation-from-uk-over-20-year-jail-sentence-imposed-under-sheikh-hasinas-regime-in-dhaka/articleshow/128273210.cms,"



A Bangladeshi migrant has won the right to remain in Britain after a court ruled that he cannot be deported because he would face a 20-year prison sentence on explosives charges if he returned home.The man, referred to in court as MM, was granted asylum after successfully arguing that the charges against him in Bangladesh were false and politically motivated. He said he had been targeted by the previous Awami League government because of his links to an opposing political group, reports the Daily Mail.The Home Office accepted that the bomb charges were probably bogus but said that he could safely return because the political situation in Bangladesh had changed. However, the Upper Tribunal ruled in his favour.MM told the tribunal that he was a “political leader” of Islami Chhatra Shibir, the student wing of the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami party. He said the Awami League had brought false criminal charges against him in 2015 while he was in Cyprus.He provided court documents showing that he had been convicted in his absence and sentenced to 20 years in prison. The documents were verified as genuine.Seven other men, including Ahsan Habib, Mostafa Kamal, Mehedi Hasan, Rabiul Islam, Monowar Hossain, Jamirul Islam and Moynul Islam, were previously convicted and given the same sentence.Upper Tribunal Judge Madeleine Reeds said: “[It was] confirmed that the [migrant's] case relied upon the preserved finding that there were genuinely issued court documents demonstrating that he had been convicted and sentenced to 20 years imprisonment and that there were two further outstanding arrest warrants and the question was what risk the [he] faced on return in light of having been convicted in absentia and considering the country information. ""They added: “He submitted that the Home Office's approach to the case was difficult to follow in light of the preserved finding that the documents were genuinely issued documents from the court that were politically motivated and false rather than based on any criminal conduct.""Also: “Those documents having been found to be genuine, is therefore determinative of the appeal in MM's favour.”The Home Office argued that the removal of Sheikh Hasina and the Awami League from power in August 2024 meant MM would no longer be at risk. After months of student-led protests that turned into a nationwide uprising, Hasina resigned and fled to India. A United Nations report said up to 1,400 people were killed during the unrest, most shot by security forces.Judge Reeds said the Awami League had not been fully removed from power and still had supporters inside government offices and law enforcement. She referred to reports saying the country remains unstable and that some innocent people have been arrested while authorities review cases believed to be politically motivated.She concluded: “I therefore conclude that there is a reasonable likelihood on these particular facts of the [migrant] being detained for what both parties accept are politically motivated charges and conviction and which are not legitimate and do not reflect any wrongdoing by [him].""And added: “Whilst they relate to events from the previous regime, the conviction remains and the sentence is a long one and on the evidence as it stands, there is a real risk that he will not be released on bail.”The tribunal allowed his appeal, meaning he will remain in UK.", Bangladeshi migrant has won the right to remain in Britain.

Bhubaneswar: Industrial Boost, Caste Boycott, Tragic Elephant Attack & Hockey Heroics





KENDRAPADA: In a stark reminder of prevailing caste prejudice in rural Odisha, parents have stopped sending their children to an anganwadi centre after an educated dalit girl was appointed as helper-cum-cook, forcing the centre to remain shut for nearly three months.Authorities had appointed Sarmista Sethi (23), a graduate, as an anganwadi helper at the Nuagaon centre under Ghadiamala gram panchayat in Rajnagar block about four months back. Soon after, the village committee, consisting mostly members from the upper caste, decided not to send children to the centre in protest against her appointment. Officials are yet to break the deadlock, leaving the fate of around 60 children hanging in balance.Around 45 families, including seven dalit families, live in this riverside village. Sarmista faced open resistance from parents who told anganwadi worker Lizarani Pandav, an upper-caste woman, that their children would not have food prepared by a dalit woman. The village committee head also reportedly instructed families — including the dalit households— not to send their children to the centre.“I was posted on Nov 24, 2025. Some upper-caste villagers warned me not to cook for the kids.When I refused to obey, they stopped sending their children to the centre. Even the women have stopped coming,” said Sarmista.Sailendra Mishra, sarpanch of Ghadiamala panchayat said they had urged the village head and others to send the children to the centre. “But they didn’t listen. Pregnant women have also been avoiding the centre and losing out on crucial health benefits,” the sarpanch said.Lizarani said she has informed the chief development project officer (CDPO) of Rajnagar block, who assured her that action would be taken against those preventing children and pregnant women from visiting the centre.CDPO Dipali Mishra said many upper-caste parents opposed the idea of their children eating food cooked by a dalit woman. “We have been trying to convince them. Me, along with the Rajnagar tehsildar, held discussions with villagers on Tuesday, but the issue remains unresolved,” she said.Ramakanta Das, a villager, said many parents did not want their children to consume food prepared by the dalit woman. “So they decided not to send them to the centre,” Ramakanta said.On Tuesday, a team of dalit leaders visited the village and alleged administrative inaction against those who illegally prevented children and women from attending the anganwadi centre. “The Supreme Court, in its interim order dated April 20, 2004, in PUCL vs Government of India, had clearly stated that SC/ST candidates should be given priority as cooks in midday meals,” said Nagen Jena, district president of Dalit Samaj.Kendrapada district collector Raghuram R Iyer said after learning about the incident, he directed the district social welfare officer to submit a detailed report. “Action will be taken against those who barred children and others from attending the centre on the pretext of a dalit girl’s appointment. We are also trying to resolve the matter amicably,” the collector said.","Authorities had appointed Sarmista Sethi (23), a graduate, as an anganwadi helper at the Nuagaon centre under Ghadiamala gram panchayat in Rajnagar block about four months back.

MUMBAI: A fortnight after gunshots were fired outside filmmaker Rohit Shetty's residence in Juhu, actor Ranveer Singh was learnt to have received a threat accompanied by a demand for several crores.Sources said the threat was sent as a WhatsApp voice note from an unidentified number to Singh's secretary. The sender claimed to be speaking on behalf of the Bishnoi gang.Security around Singh's residence was increased after the voice note, said police sources.In a related development, the managing committee of the Beau Monde residential tower in Prabhadevi approached the Dadar police station about the deployment of six armed private security guards without the permission of the society at the flat occupied by Singh and his actor wife Deepika Padukone. In a written communication, the society said suddenly now a uniformed police official was also seen stationed with the actors.Though senior police officials remained tight-lipped on the extortion matter, sources said Singh was not an isolated target. Over the past 15 days, about a dozen Bollywood personalities are said to have received threatening calls from people who identified themselves as members of the Bishnoi gang.No complaint or FIR has been registered so far by any of the threatened celebrities.The latest threat comes even as the crime branch is struggling to nab the unidentified shooter who fired five rounds outside Shetty's home last month.On Feb 5, TOI was the first to report the surge in threat calls undert the headline ‘5 More Bollywood celebrities targeted by Lonkar: Cops'.Investigators said that soon after the firing at Shetty's house, several Bollywood figures began receiving extortion calls. Most of them reportedly blocked unknown numbers or stopped answering unfamiliar calls altogether.Even Singh's secretary is believed to have blocked unknown callers, which may have prompted the extortionist to send a voice note directly to the assistant's phone.The growing menace of the Bishnoi gang — particularly after the firing outside Salman Khan's residence, the murder of NCP leader Baba Siddiqui last year, and the attack on Shetty's house — has gripped Mumbai's film fraternity with fear, evoking memories of the 1990s and early 2000s when underworld influence, shootouts and threat calls were rampant.At least nine teams of the crime branch are camping in Lucknow and adjoining towns in Uttar Pradesh to track down the shooter involved in the Shetty firing case. A police official told TOI that the shooter had been identified and digitally tracked to Lucknow, and efforts are underway to arrest him at the earliest.",Ranveer Singh received a threat accompanied by a demand for several crores.

‘Uncle Jeffrey’: Top Goldman Sachs lawyer Kathryn Ruemmler resigns over Epstein links — details of exchange emerge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/uncle-jeffrey-top-goldman-sachs-lawyer-kathryn-ruemmler-resigns-over-epstein-links-details-of-exchange-emerge/articleshow/128286821.cms,"Ruemmler's ties to Epstein



Emails detail advice, personal exchanges and years-long ties







Kathryn Ruemmler, chief legal officer at Goldman Sachs and one of the highest paid lawyers in the US, resigned on Thursday night after the justice department released emails and other documents detailing her extensive relationship with infamous financier and convicted sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein For years, Ruemmler and the financial services firm had maintained that her contact with Epstein was strictly professional. However, emails, text messages and photographs released to the public last month presented a completely different picture, indicating that the lawyer had been closer to him even before she joined Goldman in 2020.Goldman’s chief executive David M Solomon said in a statement that he had accepted her resignation, “and I respect her decision.”Ruemmler had been general counsel since 2021 and also served as a partner and vice chair of the bank’s reputational risk committee. Earlier, she worked as White House counsel under Barack Obama and later as a white-collar defence lawyer at Latham & Watkins.“My responsibility is to put Goldman Sachs' interests first,” Ruemmler said.Goldman had defended her in recent weeks, saying that her links with Epstein happened before she was hired and were appropriate.However, the Justice Department’s latest release, more than 10,000 documents mentioning her, showed a relationship that stretched over many years.The records showed Ruemmler acting as a counsellor, confidant and friend to Epstein. She advised him on how to answer difficult questions about his sex crimes, spoke about her own dating life, discussed ways to avoid negative media coverage and called him “sweetie” and “Uncle Jeffrey”.According to The Guardian, an email “So lovely and thoughtful! Thank you to Uncle Jeffrey!!!” Ruemmler wrote to Epstein in 2018.In return, Epstein offered career guidance about her move to Goldman, introduced her to prominent businesspeople and gave her gifts including spa treatments, luxury goods and high-end travel. Furthermore, within the hundreds of messages examined by CNN about Epstein’s legal troubles and damage to his reputation, there were also more intimate notes between the pair, including talk of a potential trip to his island and references to presents he had given her.From 2014, Kathryn began what she described in one email as a “friendship”. She explained Epstein how the law distinguishes between underage victims of sex crimes and adult prostitutes. “I think the point is that if she was underage, she could not legally consent to engaging in prostitution,” Ruemmler wrote to Epstein in 2015.She also advised the disgraced financer on how to challenge the credibility of an accuser, saying in one message that his lawyer could push the woman into a “perjury trap.”Back in 2015, on Epstein’s 62nd birthday, Ruemmler sent him an email, writing, “I hope you enjoy the day with your one true love. :-)”. Some emails ended with “xoxo”, and the two exchanged photographs. In other conversations, she joked about the weight of visitors at New Jersey rest stops and speculated about the sexual orientation of a well-known hedge fund billionaire, according to the New York Times.Ruemmler, over a series of meetings, also asked for Epstein’s views on personal and professional issues, including her dating concerns. “men aren't interested in women my age,” one email said.Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs and Ruemmler have maintained that Epstein was never her client. Yet in 2018, when she helped him edit a legal document defending his 2008 plea deal for soliciting prostitution from a minor, the emails between them carried the subject line, “Attorney Client.”","Kathryn Ruemmler, one of the highest paid lawyers in the US, resigned on Thursday night.

Suspect found dead, motive unclear

What PM Mark Carney said





For 12-year-old Maya Edmonds, Tuesday began like any other school day. By evening, she was in critical care, fighting for her life after being shot in the head and neck during a deadly attack at her school.Maya is currently undergoing intensive treatment at Vancouver Children’s Hospital. Doctors are working to repair the damage from her injuries, and her recovery timeline remains uncertain.“Today started as any other. Now my 12-year-old daughter is fighting for her life,” her mother wrote in an emotional social media post. “This doesn’t even feel real… I never thought I would be asking for prayers, but please, please pray for my baby.”Maya was among at least 25 people injured in the shooting at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School. Police have confirmed that eight people were killed in the attack.For her family, however, the numbers fade beside the image of their daughter lying in a hospital bed. A fundraising campaign launched by relatives has already raised significant support to help cover medical and travel expenses, allowing her mother to remain by her side.The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said the suspect was found deceased inside the school from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.Authorities have not publicly released the name. Police described the suspect as a female and confirmed investigators are working to determine the motive behind the attack.Two additional bodies were discovered at a nearby residence believed to be connected to the suspect. Officials initially reported a higher death toll but later clarified that one critically injured victim survived and remains in serious condition.Investigators are examining whether there were warning signs or prior interactions that could shed light on what led to the tragedy.Addressing the nation, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney called it “a very difficult day for the country.” “This morning, parents, grandparents, sisters and brothers will wake up without someone they love,” he said, appearing visibly shaken.Carney announced that flags on federal buildings would be flown at half-mast for seven days and urged Canadians to come together in support of the grieving community.“We will get through this. We will learn from this. But right now, it is a time to come together, to mourn together and to support one another,” he said.In Tumbler Ridge, a small and tightly knit community, the tragedy has left families reeling. But in a hospital room in Vancouver, the focus remains on one 12-year-old girl whose fight for survival has become the most personal face of a national tragedy.","Maya Edmonds, 12, is fighting for her life after being shot in the head and neck.

CNN’s Kaitlan Collins reveals rare act of kindness from Karoline Leavitt after Saudi security standoff,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cnns-kaitlan-collins-reveals-rare-act-of-kindness-from-karoline-leavitt-after-saudi-security-standoff/articleshow/128282297.cms,"



White House press briefings rarely produce moments of mutual praise. But CNN anchor Kaitlan Collins recently acknowledged one, and it involved one of her most frequent sparring partners, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.Appearing on Heather McMahan’s Absolutely podcast, Collins recounted an incident during a presidential trip to Saudi Arabia when she was nearly barred from attending a press event after asking a question that unsettled local officials. Saudi authorities, she explained, are not accustomed to aggressive questioning from reporters.According to Collins, after she posed a question, “the Saudi Royal Guard kind of freaked out.”“They came up, and they said, ‘Okay, well you can’t come into the next event,’ which was like two minutes later, and I was like, ‘That’s not how this works, I belong to the U.S. press,’ and they were like, ‘Well, you’re not coming in,’” Collins said on the podcast.She described the guards as “whispering and pointing” at her, while junior White House officials hesitated over how to respond. Ultimately, the matter was escalated to Leavitt.“To her credit, she said, ‘No, Kaitlan’s coming in with the rest of the U.S. press,’ and we went in, and so it didn’t become this big issue,” Collins said, giving the press secretary rare public acknowledgment for intervening.The moment of professional respect stands in contrast to the often-contentious exchanges between the two in the White House briefing room.In December 2025, Collins challenged President Donald Trump’s claims about economic strength during a briefing. “If the economy is as strong as the president has said it is, then why is he telling parents two weeks before Christmas that they should only buy two or three dolls for their children?” she asked.Leavitt pushed back forcefully. “Look, what the president is saying is that if we want products made right here in America, if we want them to be made from American small businesses, which is a large part of the reason the president has effectively implemented tariffs, then we’re going to have better quality products right here in the United States,” she responded.She added, “Maybe you’ll pay a dollar or two more, but you will get better quality, and you’ll be supporting your fellow Americans by buying American.”Collins continued pressing, raising concerns about rising grocery prices and what she described as “mixed signals.” Leavitt fired back sharply.“My predecessor stood up at this podium, and she said inflation doesn’t exist. She said the border was secure and people like you just took her at her word, and that those were two utter lies,” Leavitt told Collins.She also took aim at CNN directly. “Well, I think the president’s comments yesterday about the sale of CNN and new leadership are evidenced by my exchange with the CNN reporter in this room. Their viewership has gone down, their ratings have declined, and I think the president rightfully believes that network would benefit from new ownership. With respect to this deal, he has great respect for both companies that are bidding against one another. ”",CNN anchor Kaitlan Collins and White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt had a rare moment of professional respect.

RFK Jr says he ‘snorted cocaine off toilet seats’ as he explains why he’s ‘not scared of a germ’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/rfk-jr-says-he-snorted-cocaine-off-toilet-seats-as-he-explains-why-hes-not-scared-of-a-germ/articleshow/128281276.cms,"



The Department of Health and Human Services has increasingly found itself at the center of controversy, as its secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., advances health claims that critics say are not backed by established scientific consensus and often challenge long-standing medical guidance.That tension between mainstream public health policy and Kennedy’s personal views resurfaced this week during an appearance on comedian Theo Von’s podcast, This Past Weekend w/ Theo Von, where the HHS chief spoke candidly about his past drug addiction, and made a remark that quickly drew attention.“I said this when we came in and, I said, ‘I don't care what happens, I'm going to a meeting every day.’ I'm not scared of a germ. I used to snort cocaine off of toilet seats,” Kennedy said during the episode.The 72-year-old official explained that he has been sober for more than four decades and still attends daily recovery meetings. He told Von that during the 2020 COVID-19 shutdowns, he organized what he described as a “pirate group” so recovering addicts could continue meeting despite restrictions.“I know this disease will kill me if I don't treat it, which for me means going to meetings every day.It's just bad for my life. So, for me, it was survival,” he added.Kennedy and Von also discussed the importance of the recovery community in maintaining sobriety. Kennedy’s struggles with addiction date back to his youth: he was arrested at 16 for marijuana possession and, at 30, was arrested in South Dakota for heroin possession, an incident that pushed him toward treatment.His remarks about germs and past drug use come as Kennedy remains under scrutiny for his leadership at HHS. Since taking office under President Donald Trump, he has promoted his “Making America Healthy Again” platform, arguing that chronic disease in the United States is linked to environmental toxins, chemicals in food, and what he describes as systemic failures in medicine.Medical experts, however, have raised alarms over several of his positions. Kennedy has long questioned vaccine safety, a stance widely rejected by leading health organizations, though he denies being anti-vaccine. While serving as HHS secretary, he dismissed a group of vaccine specialists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including its chief, and replaced them with individuals described as vaccine skeptics, prompting criticism from lawmakers and public health advocates.He has also withdrawn contracts and cut $500 million in funding for 22 mRNA vaccine research projects. In addition, he eliminated a federal regulation encouraging hospitals to track and report staff vaccination levels.Kennedy has previously suggested a link between vaccines and autism, a claim consistently debunked by large-scale scientific studies. He has also supported assertions connecting acetaminophen use during pregnancy with autism, a theory many researchers say relies on disputed evidence.","Robert F.

"Trump defends deleted video depicting Obamas as apes, says it referenced ‘The Lion King’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-defends-deleted-video-depicting-obamas-as-apes-says-it-referenced-the-lion-king/articleshow/128279388.cms,"Trump's Meme Backfires; US Pres. Deletes Video Of Obamas As Monkeys | White House Blames Staffer





President Donald Trump on Thursday defended the posting of a racially charged video depicting former President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama as apes by suggesting it was tied to Disney’s The Lion King.The controversy stems from a video shared last week on Trump’s Truth Social account that portrayed the Obamas, alongside other Democratic leaders, as animals, invoking a well-known racist trope. The post was later deleted by the White House, which said a staffer had “erroneously made the post.” The identity of that staffer has not been disclosed.During an Environmental Protection Agency event at the White House, a reporter pressed Trump on whether anyone had faced consequences. “Mr. President, have you fired or disciplined that staffer who posted the video from your account that included the Obamas?” the reporter asked.“No, I haven't,” Trump replied. “That was a video on, as you know, voter fraud and fairly long video, and they had a little piece and had to do with the Lion King.”He continued to defend the broader clip, arguing it had circulated widely before appearing on his account.“It's been very, well, it's been shown all over the place long before that was posted,” Trump said.“But that was a very strong, and I'm sure you saw it, a very strong piece on voter fraud. And the piece that you're talking about was all over the place. Many times, I believe, for years.”Hours after Trump shared the video, right-wing influencer Laura Loomer posted a longer version portraying numerous elected officials as animals, including Trump as “king of the jungle.”The backlash was swift. According to CNN, Republican lawmakers privately urged Trump to take the video down. “Sources tell me Republican lawmakers called Trump directly about the post, asking for it to be removed Of course, many GOP senators & House members also publicly called for him to do so,” CNN White House correspondent Alayna Treene reported.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt later addressed the matter in a statement.“This is from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the King of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from The Lion King,” Leavitt said. She added that the video was “fake.”“Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public,” she said.The episode unsettled some Republicans. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott reacted publicly, saying: “Praying it was fake because it’s the most racist thing I’ve seen out of this White House. The President should remove it.”","President Donald Trump defended the posting of a racially charged video depicting former President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama as apes.

FBI recovers black glove near Nancy Guthrie’s home in kidnapping probe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fbi-recovers-black-glove-near-nancy-guthries-home-in-kidnapping-probe/articleshow/128275651.cms,"



FBI agents recovered a black glove from a roadside near Nancy Guthrie’s house, in what authorities treated as a potential clue in the search for the masked suspect believed to have abducted the 84-year-old woman, The Post reported.Detectives found the clothing item, which resembled the pair worn by the armed perpetrator caught on video, about one and a half miles from the home of “Today” show co-host Savannah Guthrie’s mother, in a secluded desert suburb on the edge of Tucson. Video and photos showed at least one member of the FBI Evidence Response team pulling the glove from low desert shrubbery during an “extensive search” of the neighbourhood, with agents combing roadsides.Authorities did not identify any suspects in the presumed kidnapping, in which Guthrie appeared to have been forced from her home, leaving a trail of blood behind. On Tuesday, the FBI released footage of a man with black gloves, a ski mask, and a holstered gun destroying the security camera on her door.The same day, authorities detained a person of interest for questioning near the Mexican border, but the person was released early today without charges.The person of interest questioned Tuesday was Carlos Palazuelos, a delivery driver from the border town of Rio Rico, who was handcuffed after being pulled over south of Tucson. Palazuelos, now free, insisted he had nothing to do with Guthrie’s abduction, had not even heard of the woman, and demanded an apology from authorities, according to WDBJ.The FBI said the glove was discovered during the neighbourhood search. “We appreciate the assistance and support we have received from the Tucson community,” the FBI said in a statement reminding the public of the $50,000 reward for information leading to Nancy Guthrie’s recovery. Investigators did not comment when asked about the potential piece of evidence.Meanwhile, a note was sent to TMZ on Wednesday morning demanding a bitcoin transfer in exchange for information about Guthrie’s captor. TMZ reported that the $67,000 payment would be in exchange for the “name of the individual involved.”The letter, described as the third alleged note sent out since Nancy was last seen on Jan. 31, contained details of a working bitcoin address, TMZ host Harvey Levin said during Wednesday’s appearance on Fox News’ “America’s Newsroom.” The bitcoin address was different from the one featured in the original ransom note, which was sent to two Tucson-area TV news stations along with TMZ last week. The self-proclaimed kidnappers demanded millions of dollars in crypto currency, setting a final deadline for Monday, Feb. 9.The letter’s authors did not provide proof of life or further information, despite Savannah Guthrie saying her family would pay if it meant getting their mother back safe.","FBI agents recovered a black glove from a roadside near Nancy Guthrie’s house, in what authorities treated as a potential clue in the search for the masked suspect believed to have abducted the 84-year-old woman.

‘You should resign’: Shouting match erupts between Josh Hawley and Keith Ellison over fraud probe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/you-should-resign-shouting-match-erupts-between-josh-hawley-and-keith-ellison-over-fraud-probe/articleshow/128273768.cms,"



Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison got into a shouting match during a Senate hearing Thursday morning over a federal investigation into fraud in the state.Hawley accused Ellison of being complicit in a fraud scheme that resulted in the theft of federal funds allocated for Minnesota social service programmes. Federal prosecutors estimated that millions of dollars were stolen during the scheme, The Hills reported.“You’ve been right at the center of this project from the beginning, and you’ve enabled it, and you should resign,” Hawley said during his turn to ask questions at the Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing.Ellison retorted, “You should resign. I was thinking the same thing about you.”Hawley, with his voice rising, lobbed a series of accusations at Ellison and suggested that the attorney general should be “indicted” as Ellison vehemently denied the lawmakers’ claims.Hawley claimed that Ellison and his family profited from the scheme. A Minnesota whistleblower alleged that Ellison and other state officials knew about the fraud scheme as early as 2019, but that the officials failed to intervene.“For the record, he’s lying, and that’s the truth,” Ellison said.The interaction was tense from the beginning, with Ellison refusing to answer Hawley’s opening question confirming his job title.“Mr. Ellison, you’re in my courtroom now, you’re under oath, so I suggest that you answer my questions,” Hawley said.Committee Chair Rand Paul (R-Ky.) intervened several times, telling Hawley, “I think we’ve made a point.”Hawley responded, “Oh I’ll ask how I want to, Senator Paul.”At another point in the exchange, Hawley told Ellison, “It’s my hearing, pal.” The two talked over each other with Ellison retorting, “Don’t call me pal.”“I should call you prisoner because you ought to be in jail,” Hawley shot back.Ellison has long been a target of Republicans. He was one of the Minnesota officials subpoenaed by the Justice Department in January over allegations that state officials interfered with the federal immigration operation. The attorney general filed several lawsuits since the immigration enforcement operation began, challenging the federal govt’s actions in the state.Ellison appeared on a panel with other Minnesota officials, including House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), Minnesota state House GOP Floor Leader Harry Niska, and Minnesota Department of Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell.A second panel at the hearing included U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joseph Edlow, Customs and Border Protection Director Rodney Scott and acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Todd Lyons. Paul had demanded the three immigration officials appear before the panel after the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis.Ellison also faced heat during the Thursday morning hearing from Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Ashley Moody (R-Fla.).Johnson accused the attorney general of being responsible for the two people killed by federal law enforcement in Minnesota.“Attorney General, you did the exact opposite and two people are dead because you encouraged them to put themselves in harm’s way,” the senator said.Ellison denied Johnson’s accusations.“It was a nice theatrical performance, but it was all lies,” the attorney general said.",Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison got into a shouting match during a Senate hearing Thursday morning over a federal investigation into fraud in the state. Hawley accused Ellison of being complicit in a fraud scheme that resulted in the theft of federal funds allocated for Minnesota social service programmes.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128274037,imgsize-27968,width-400,resizemode-4/josh-hawley-left-and-keith-ellison-right.jpg"
Who is Andrew Paul Johnson?

A Florida handyman who was pardoned by US President Donald Trump for his role in the January 6 US Capitol riot has now been found guilty of multiple child sex abuse charges.Andrew Paul Johnson was convicted on Tuesday by a jury in Florida of five offences. These included molesting a child under 12, molesting another child under 16, and lewd and lascivious exhibition. He was acquitted of one charge of sending sexual material to a child. NPR first reported the verdict.Johnson was arrested in August. According to a police report obtained by NPR, he sexually abused and molested children for multiple monthsDisguised as an 11-year-old's 'ex-boyfriend'The case came to light after the mother of one of the victims discovered that Johnson, described as her “ex-boyfriend”, had sent “inappropriate” messages to her young son on the gaming platform Discord. When she confronted her son, he told her that Johnson had molested him three times “between April 1, 2024, and October 2024,” beginning when he was 11 years old.The police report also said Johnson tried to keep the victim quiet. He allegedly claimed that the Trump administration was paying him $10 million in restitution because he had been a January 6 defendant. He also told the child he would include him in his will so he could receive any remaining money.The report stated: “This tactic was believed to be used to keep [redacted name] from exposing what Andrew had done to him.”January 6 defendants have called for financial compensation, but none have received payments.Johnson had previously pleaded guilty to nonviolent offences linked to the Capitol riot. In 2024, he was sentenced to one year in prison. A sentencing memorandum said prosecutors recommended that sentence because “Johnson climbed over broken glass to enter the US Capitol building through an office window that had been smashed out,” and asked other rioters to follow him inside.He also engaged in “disorderly and disruptive conduct” on Capitol grounds for several hours before being arrested. Prosecutors later alleged that Johnson spread false claims about the riot on social media and called for a second riot a year after his arrest.The memorandum added that “[Johnson] violated his conditions of release on at least ten separate occasions; and has a long criminal history”.Johnson was among roughly 1,500 January 6 defendants pardoned by Trump early in his second term. He is due to be sentenced in March and could face life sentence.","Andrew Paul Johnson was convicted on Tuesday by a jury in Florida of five offences.

What are the new rules for truckers?

Who can get a CDL under the existing rule?





After series of accidents involving migrant, non-English speaking drivers, the Trump administration is rolling out new regulations to keep unqualified foreigners from driving commercial vehicles. New rules will drastically reduce the number of eligible people and will also close the loopholes that now exist between the federal rules and the state rules. Harjinder Singh, Jashanpreet Singh, Rajinder Kumar and Kamalpreet Singh -- all Indian-origin truck drivers -- have been accused of causing fatal crashes on American highways in the past few months. All of them obtained a non-domiciled CDL in California.“For far too long, America has allowed dangerous foreign drivers to abuse our truck licensing systems – wreaking havoc on our roadways,” transportation secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement to Daily Caller. “Moving forward, unqualified foreign drivers will be unable to get a license to operate an 80,000-pound big rig.”“Under President Trump’s leadership, we are putting the safety of the driving public first,” Duffy continued. “From enforcing English language standards to holding fraudulent carriers accountable, we will continue to attack this crisis on our roads head on.”H-2A, H-2B and E-2 nonimmigrant status holders who have undergone federal screening will be eligible for CDL.H-2A visa holders are temporary agricultural workers. H-2B visa holders are termporary non-agriculrural workers. E2 are treaty investors.The new rule also prohibits the acceptance of EADs as proof of eligibility and requires state officials to query the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements system to confirm every foreign applicant’s lawful immigration status.The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration said about 17 fatal crashes that occurred in 2025 “that were caused by actions of non-domiciled CDL holders whose fitness could not be ensured and thus would be ineligible under this new rule.” The agency also accused more than 30 states of improperly issuing non-domiciled CDLs.Non-citizens with any valid work authorization, including Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) such as those held by DACA recipients, asylum seekers, refugees, TPS holders, and others, could apply for a non-domiciled CDL/CLP, as long as they had valid work authorization and immigration documentation.","The Trump administration is rolling out new regulations to keep unqualified foreigners from driving commercial vehicles.

'Surge is leaving state safer': Trump administration ends Minnesota immigration crackdown after months of turmoil,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/surge-is-leaving-state-safer-trump-administration-ends-minnesota-immigration-crackdown-after-months-of-turmoil/articleshow/128267017.cms,"$9 Bn Somali Minnesota Fraud Ignites Fiery Durbin Vs Cornyn Debate On National Security In US Senate





The Trump administration ended an immigration crackdown in Minnesota that led to thousands of arrests, violent protests, and the fatal shootings of two US citizens over the past two months, border czar Tom Homan said Thursday.The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation, described as the Department of Homeland Security's “ largest immigration enforcement operation ever ”, focused on the Minneapolis-St. Paul area and resulted in more than 4,000 arrests, Homan said, AP reported.“The surge is leaving Minnesota safer,” he said. “I’ll say it again, it’s less of a sanctuary state for criminals.”The operation became a flashpoint in the debate over President Donald Trump’s mass deportation efforts, flaring up after Renee Good and Alex Pretti were killed by federal officers in Minneapolis. The announcement marked a significant retreat from an operation that became a major distraction for the Trump administration and was more volatile than prior crackdowns in Chicago and Los Angeles.Homan said immigration enforcement would not end when the Minnesota operation was over.“President Trump made a promise of mass deportation and that’s what this country is going to get,” Homan said.Democratic Governor Tim Walz said Tuesday that he expected Operation Metro Surge, which started in December, to end in “days, not weeks and months,” based on his conversations with senior Trump administration officials.While the Trump administration called those arrested in Minnesota “dangerous criminal illegal aliens,” many people with no criminal records, including children and US citizens, were also detained.Homan said last week that 700 federal officers would leave Minnesota immediately, but that still left more than 2,000 on Minnesota’s streets. At the time, he cited an “increase in unprecedented collaboration” resulting in the need for fewer federal officers in Minnesota, including help from jails that hold deportable inmates.Homan said Thursday that the drawdown began this week and will continue next week. He said he planned to stay in Minnesota to oversee the drawdown.Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said Tuesday he had a “positive meeting” with Homan a day earlier and discussed the potential for a further drawdown of federal officers.Homan took over the Minnesota operation in late January after the second fatal shooting by federal immigration agents and amid growing political backlash and questions about how the operation was being run.“We’re very much in a trust but verify mode,” Walz said Tuesday, adding that he expected to hear more from the administration “in the next day or so” about the future of what he said had been an “occupation” and a “retribution campaign” against the state.","Border czar Tom Homan says 4,000 arrests were made in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area.

The Supreme Court of Pakistan on Thursday directed authorities to constitute a medical board to assess the health of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan after reports surfaced about a loss of vision in one of his eyes.A bench comprising Chief Justice Yahya Afridi and Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan also instructed officials to facilitate communication between Khan and his two sons, who live in the United Kingdom with his former wife, British producer and screenwriter Jemima Goldsmith.“The issue of Imran’s health is most important. Intervention is necessary. His phone calls with his son are also important,” Chief Justice Afridi said during the hearing.The order came after the bench resumed hearing a case about the jail conditions of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder-president and ordered a detailed medical check-up before February 16. During the hearing, Attorney General Mansoor Usman Awan said it was the state’s responsibility to provide the former prime minister with medical care.The order also came two days after the court asked PTI leader and lawyer Salman Safdar to meet Khan at Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, where the cricketer-turned-politician has been held since August 5, 2023, following his conviction in a corruption case.Safdar later submitted his report to the court after meeting Khan. It was the first meeting with the jailed leader since December 2, when his sister, Uzma Khan, was allowed to see him for 20 minutes.Meanwhile, Dawn newspaper, citing the report, noted that it detailed Safdar’s meeting with Khan, the condition of his cell, the facilities provided to him, a description of his living area and the process the lawyer followed to reach the jail.In the report, Safdar quoted Khan as stating that despite receiving treatment, including an injection, he has only 15% vision left in his right eye.Khan reportedly told Safdar that until October 2025, he had normal vision in both eyes. He later began experiencing constant blurred and hazy vision, which he repeatedly reported to the then jail superintendent, but no action was taken.The report added that Khan eventually suffered a sudden and complete loss of vision in his right eye. An eye specialist from Pims Hospital, Dr Muhammad Arif, was then called to examine him.He was diagnosed with a blood clot that caused serious damage. Despite treatment, including an injection, his vision in the right eye remains at only 15 per cent.A day earlier, Safdar denied making any statement about Khan’s health on Tuesday, clarifying that anything attributed to him on the matter had been misrepresented or misreported.However, on the day he met Khan, Safdar told reporters that the jailed leader was “fine and healthy.”","Supreme Court of Pakistan orders medical board to assess Imran Khan's health.

Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif has delivered a scathing assessment of his country’s past alliances with Washington, telling the National Assembly that Islamabad had been “used like toilet paper and then discarded” after serving American interests in Afghanistan.Speaking during a debate on terrorism following a deadly suicide bombing at a Shia mosque in Islamabad, Asif said Pakistan had repeatedly joined “superpower wars” that were never its own.“We took part in two wars that were fought on the soil of Afghanistan,” Asif told lawmakers. Referring to the Soviet intervention in 1979, he claimed it was carried out “at the invitation of the government in Kabul” and that the narrative of an outright invasion was shaped by the United States.Pakistan, he said, entered those conflicts “in the name of Islam and religion”, but in reality two former military dictators sought legitimacy and the backing of a global power.“These were not our wars; they were superpower wars,” he said, adding that Pakistan and its land were used and then discarded ""like toilet paper.""Asif went on to describe terrorism in Pakistan as the “blowback of mistakes committed by dictators in the past”.He added that Pakistan had failed to learn from history, continuing to shift between Washington, Moscow and London in pursuit of short-term interests.""For our own interests, we sometimes turn to Washington, sometimes to Moscow, and sometimes to Britain. We have built strong franchises here, which was not the case 30 or 40 years ago,"" Asif said.Recalling then US President Bill Clinton’s brief stop in Islamabad in 2000, a visit lasting only a few hours at the end of a longer India trip, Asif said it underscored how transactional the relationship had become. Clinton’s engagement with then military ruler Pervez Musharraf was framed by US demands on democracy, non-proliferation and militancy, reinforcing.Asif’s remarks came as parliament passed a resolution condemning the attack on Imambargah Qasr-e-Khadijatul Kubra in Islamabad’s Tarlai area, where a suicide bomber killed 31 people and wounded 169 during Friday prayers. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility. Thousands attended funerals across the capital as grieving families demanded accountability. “What happened yesterday has left us extremely angry and deeply hurt,” said Bushra Rahmani, whose brother was among the wounded.The minister urged political unity, lamenting what he called a lack of consensus even in condemning terrorism. “It is very important that we have a national identity on which no one disagrees,” he said, criticising those who, for political reasons, avoided attending the funerals of victims.","Defence minister Khawaja Asif criticises Pakistan's past alliances with the U.S. and Russia.

‘China no longer trusts us’

Backdrop of deadly Islamabad attack





Pakistan’s Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Sunday launched a sharp attack on Pakistan’s handling of militancy and its Afghanistan policy, questioning how extremist elements continue to cross the border even as trade remains blocked.Speaking at a public gathering in Rawalpindi, Rehman highlighted what he described as a glaring contradiction in Islamabad’s approach towards Afghanistan. “In all these decades, we never paused to ask why our Afghan policy failed so miserably. Not a single pomegranate or melon can enter Pakistan, yet terrorists keep crossing the border,” he said, smiling as he made the remark.Referring to repeated claims by Pakistani authorities that militants were entering from Afghanistan, Rehman added, “Authorities say terrorists are coming from there. If they are coming, stop them. If they are coming, eliminate them. The Afghan government has never objected to your actions.”The JUI-F leader also criticised Pakistan’s broader foreign and economic policies, calling them “complete failures”. He said Islamabad’s diplomatic approach had left the country increasingly isolated.“India is our enemy, Afghanistan is our enemy, and even Iran and China are upset with us,” Rehman said, adding that the public deserved answers.“A nation cannot survive when its policies produce only isolation, mistrust and insecurity.”He argued that Pakistan’s foreign policy was being driven not by elected governments but by the military establishment. “One general comes and says we will negotiate; another comes and says we will wage war,” he said.Rehman also took aim at the government’s handling of the China-Pakistan economic corridor (CPEC), claiming that the flagship infrastructure project had stalled due to declining Chinese confidence.“CPEC has seen no real progress during this tenure because China no longer trusts us,” he said, questioning whether “even a single brick” had moved under the current government. He claimed Beijing had expected the Pakistan democratic movement (PDM) government to stabilise relations and revive projects, but remained dissatisfied.Rehman’s remarks come amid heightened tensions following a suicide bombing at a mosque in Islamabad on Friday that killed 69 people and injured more than 170, according to local media reports citing hospital officials. The blast occurred during Friday prayers at Imambargah Qasr-i-Khadijatul Kubra in the Tarlai area, Dawn reported.After Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif suggested on X that preliminary findings pointed to the attacker having travelled to and from Afghanistan, Kabul rejected the allegation. Afghanistan’s ministry of national defence termed the claim “irresponsible and baseless” and urged Pakistani authorities to take responsibility for internal security lapses, Afghan media outlet Ariana News reported.The Afghan ministry said similar accusations had been made in the past following attacks in Balochistan and other parts of Pakistan, without conclusive evidence.","Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman criticises Pakistan’s handling of militancy and its Afghanistan policy.

NEW DELHI: Global terror outfit Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the deadly blast at a Shia mosque in Islamabad that led to over three dozen casualties on Friday. Toll rose to 36 on Saturday after some critically injured people died in hospitals, said a PTI report.In a related development that has attracted the attention of Indian security establishment, the Islamic State in its latest al-Naba issue called on members of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) to defect and join the Islamic State in Khorasan Province.The claim regarding the blast was issued via IS central's mouthpiece, Amaq, stating the attack was a Fidayeen operation carried out by a soldier of the Islamic State in Pakistan Province (ISPP) -- active since 2019 -- inside the mosque compound. Amaq claimed over 200 casualties in contrast to the official Pak govt admission of 36 deaths and injuries to scores.The suicide bomber was identified by Amaq as Saifullah Ansari. His photograph taking the bayah (oath of allegiance) was also posted by the IS mouthpiece. The statement also mentioned that hundreds of Pakistani Shias had joined the pro-Iran 'Zaynabiyoun brigade' militia in Syria.The claim by Amaq followed an official denial by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which strongly rebutted any involvement in the incident.The blast, which occurred during prayers at the Khadijatul Kubra mosque in Tarlai area, was the deadliest in Islamabad since the 2008 Marriott hotel bombing.The explosion coincided with the visit of Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev to Pakistan.

'Home-Grown Ills': Islamabad Mosque Blast Triggers Blame Game As India Rejects Pakistan's Blame





The Islamic State on Saturday claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing at a Shiite mosque in Islamabad, which killed at least 36 people and injured many others.In a statement released through its Amaq News Agency, the Islamic State in Pakistan, an offshoot of Daesh, said the bomber opened fire at security guards when they tried to stop him at the entrance and then exploded inside among worshippers.The group also said Shiite Muslims in Pakistan were a target, claiming they provided recruits to militias fighting the Islamic State in Syria.The blast took place on Friday at the Khadijatul Kubra mosque-cum-shrine in the Tarlie area of the capital. The attacker, identified as 32-year-old Yasir from Peshawar, entered the mosque while worshippers were offering weekly prayers and detonated explosives.Authorities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province said they arrested four suspects, including three alleged facilitators and the mastermind, during intelligence-based raids in Peshawar and Nowshera.Investigators said an identity card recovered during the probe confirmed the attacker’s identity. Official records showed his permanent address in Abbas Colony on Charsadda Road in Peshawar.Officials also said the attacker had spent around five months in Afghanistan before the bombing, where he allegedly received training in weapons handling and suicide attacks.Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif had earlier claimed that India and Afghanistan were involved in the attack, without presenting any evidence.India had strongly rejected the allegations, saying, ""It is unfortunate that, instead of seriously addressing the problems plaguing its social fabric, Pakistan should choose to delude itself by blaming others for its home-grown ills.

Pakistan has been invited to participate in upcoming talks between Iran and the United States aimed at easing tensions between the two countries, slated to take place on Friday in Turkey.“Pakistan has received the invitation for the upcoming talks between Iran and the United States,” Pakistan foreign office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said while responding to a query, reported Dawn.Pakistan's deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar is expected to take part in the meeting, the daily reported citing a diplomatic source, adding that “Islamabad’s participation was seen as significant.”An Arab official told AFP on condition of anonymity that the meeting is likely to be held in Turkiye on Friday. The format of the talks remains unclear, though the official said the main meeting would take place that day.A regional official told Reuters that the priority of the talks was to avoid conflict and de-escalate tensions between Iran and the US, adding that several regional powers had been invited at the foreign ministers’ level.According to the official, countries invited include Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, Oman and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).US outlet Axios, citing two sources and a US official, reported that Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi was expected to meet US envoy Steve Witkoff in Istanbul to discuss a possible agreement related to Iran’s nuclear programme.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian confirmed on Tuesday that he had instructed Araghchi to pursue “fair and equitable negotiations” in an environment “free from threats and unreasonable expectations”.The talks, he said in posts on X, would be held “within the framework of our national interests”.US President Donald Trump has said he is hopeful Washington would “work something out” with Iran but warned on Monday that “bad things would happen” if no deal was reached.In an interview with CNN on Sunday, Araghchi said: “President Trump said no nuclear weapons, and we fully agree. We fully agree with that. That could be a very good deal.”“In return, we expect sanctions to be lifted,” he added, while warning that Iran was prepared for war if talks failed, saying any conflict would likely spread beyond Iran.Turkiye has been leading diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions, with Araghchi visiting Istanbul last week and engaging with regional counterparts, including in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan.Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have assured Tehran that they would not allow their airspace or territory to be used for military action against Iran, while Jordan has said it would not act as a “launching pad” for any such action.","Pakistan has been invited to participate in upcoming talks between Iran and the United States.
