"Tennis player murder case: Radhika Yadav didn’t own academy, booked courts for tennis training, says police",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tennis-player-murder-case-radhika-yadav-didnt-own-academy-booked-courts-for-tennis-training-says-police/articleshow/122403316.cms,"Radhika Yadav Murder: Dubai-based Actor Inam-ul-Haq Breaks Silence On Connection With Victim

Radhika Yadav, the 25-year-old former state-level tennis player who was allegedly shot dead by her father in Gurugram, did not run a formal academy, rather trained aspiring players by booking tennis courts across the city.“Radhika did not have her own academy. She used to train aspirants by booking tennis courts at different places. Deepak had asked her several times to stop the training sessions, but she refused. That was the main tussle between the father and daughter,” said an investigating officer, quoted by PTI.Police had earlier claimed that Radhika ran a tennis academy, a source of tension between her and Deepak, who was reportedly taunted for relying on his daughter’s income.According to police, Deepak, who had steady rental income and was financially secure, felt uncomfortable being perceived as reliant on his daughter's earnings. This had reportedly left him depressed in the weeks leading up to the shooting.Initial speculation tied Radhika’s social media activity and a 2023 music video appearance to her murder. Allegations surfaced that Deepak was displeased with her rising online presence and ambitions of becoming an influencer, with some suggesting the video featuring her alongside an independent artist may have been the cause behind the murder.However, these claims were later dismissed by the police.“The video was uploaded in 2023, it has no connection with the murder. The accused has repeatedly said that he did not want his daughter to earn through training,” inspector Vinod Kumar of Sector 56 police station told PTI.Radhika, was killed at point-blank range on Thursday by her father Deepak Yadav, 49, at their double-storey residence in sector 57. He was arrested and produced before a city court, which sent him to judicial custody on Saturday.Deepak also confessed to shooting his daughter dead, police said.On Friday, the court had sent Deepak to one-day police custody. During the remand period, officers recovered five bullets and a live cartridge from the family's sector 57 residence. He was also taken to a village in Pataudi as part of the investigation.A relative told police that Deepak had supported Radhika's tennis ambitions from a young age, but had grown increasingly upset with her continued coaching work despite his objections.Radhika suffered four gunshot wounds, three to the back and one to the shoulder, according to the post-mortem. Her funeral was held on Friday in the family’s native village of Wazirabad.","Radhika Yadav, a former state-level tennis player, was allegedly shot dead by her father in Gurugram.

KOLKATA: A 24-year-old woman psychologist accused a student of one of India's top management institutes in Kolkata of raping her in his hostel room Friday, prompting police action and his arrest. But the case took a turn less than 12 hours later, when her father publicly denied that any crime had occurred and alleged police coercion.Paramanand Toppannawar, a second-year student and Karnataka native, was picked up from his hostel on Saturday. He was produced in court and remanded in seven-day police custody under BNS sections related to rape, wrongful confinement, & use of harmful substances with intent to harm.The woman first connected with Toppannawar online. He invited her to the campus for a 'personal counselling session'. She claimed she was not permitted to enter her name in the visitors' log - a claim that institute officials dispute. Toppannawar allegedly took her to his hostel room, citing privacy. There, he offered her pizza and a drink.""I began feeling dizzy right after,"" she wrote in the complaint, quoted by police.""...I can recall him touching me inappropriately. He sexually assaulted me. I found myself on his bed when I regained my senses,"" the survivor wrote in her complaint.However, by Saturday morning, her father gave interviews to multiple TV channels, contradicting the allegation. ""My daughter had called me and said she had fallen off an autorickshaw. Cops said she was abused and arrested someone, but my daughter said nothing happened.""Police now face a wall of silence from the family.

Kill me

NEW DELHI: Moments after allegedly shooting his daughter four times, Deepak Yadav called his elder brother and said something that would shake their family forever. “Bhai, maine kanya vadh kar diya hai. Mujhe maar do (),” Vijay Yadav recalled. “He said the same thing at the police station too – hang me. He didn’t reveal a reason. He said he had lost his mind.”Radhika Yadav, a 25-year-old former tennis player from Gurugram, was shot dead at point-blank range by her father on July 11 at their Sector 57 residence. Her post-mortem confirmed four bullet wounds – three in the back and one in the shoulder. The crime stemmed from disagreements over her tennis coaching sessions and a growing desire to pursue a career outside sports, including in advertising and modelling, her uncle told ANI.Vijay Yadav described Deepak as a devoted father who had invested years of effort and money into Radhika’s tennis career. “He used to take her for training at 5 in the morning and bring her back in the evening. She had stopped going anywhere else.He had worked hard. When everyone in the village had kutcha houses, they had a pucca one,” he told ANI. “There is no bigger punishment than realisation when a person himself is guilty. ”The family has denied reports that Radhika owned a tennis academy. According to the Gurugram police, she used to book tennis courts at various locations to train others, something her father objected to. An investigating officer said Deepak was worried about societal judgement and did not want his daughter to earn money by coaching others.A friend of the accused also told police that Deepak had been deeply disturbed by comments people made about him living off his daughter’s earnings. He claimed Deepak told him he had “committed a sin” and couldn’t take the taunts any longer.WhatsApp chats between Radhika and her coach suggest she had been planning to leave home and move abroad, ANI reported. However, police say this angle is not being probed. Inspector Vinod Kumar confirmed there was no link between a music video Radhika had appeared in and the murder. “The accused has repeatedly said that he did not want his daughter to earn through training other players,” he said.The accused has been sent to 14 days’ judicial custody.","Radhika Yadav, a 25-year-old former tennis player from Gurugram, was shot dead at point-blank range.

Operation Sindoor proved India’s readiness; exposed inefficiency of Pak’s Chinese military gear: US warfare expert,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/operation-sindoor-proved-indias-readiness-exposed-inefficiency-of-paks-chinese-military-gear-us-warfare-expert/articleshow/122408721.cms,".

New Delhi: India’s Operation Sindoor was not just a warning to Pakistan, but a signal to the world about India’s military strength, says international security expert John Spencer. According to him, the strikes showed that India has both the capability and the will to respond with precision and restraint.Spencer, who is Chair of Urban Warfare Studies at the Modern War Institute (New York), told ANI in a video interview that the operation became a direct test of Indian-made systems versus Chinese military technology used by Pakistan.“This is absolutely a test of Chinese military technologies, both for the rest of the world and also for China,” he said. “It (China) uses it (Pakistan) as a lab for this technology.”India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and PoK, after a terror attack in Pahalgam killed 26 civilians. In the days that followed, India repelled Pakistani military action and hit back at key airbases. Hostilities ended after Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations reached out to the Indian side.Spencer said India’s response highlighted not just its military upgrades but also how prepared it was: “War puts everything to the test… and everybody was learning from that demonstration.”He also noted that the ineffectiveness of Chinese-made weapons used by Pakistan is under scrutiny.“The evidence was in the video, satellite footage — not in the words about how you said your Chinese systems performed.”Spencer described the situation as part of a broader “proxy warfare” dynamic, where countries like China and Turkey back Pakistan with defence ties. “There are a lot of nuances… using Pakistan and these borders to isolate India economically and militarily,” he said.He added that India’s pattern of response to cross-border terrorism has shaped a doctrine, and while wars cannot be predicted, preparation is key. “One of the ways you prevent future wars is through preparation, change, and being on the ground.”Discussing Pakistan’s reliance on Chinese gear, Spencer said there could be a rethink. “If what you bought doesn’t work, then you go back to the seller and say, ‘This didn’t work like it was supposed to.’ But you also know if there’s user error.”He added that Pakistan may now seek advanced weapons elsewhere, but money is a major problem. “They have a money problem. The IMF has to bail Pakistan out.”Spencer said he studied Operation Sindoor not just for what happened in those four days, but because it reflected years of transformation and innovation in India’s defence sector. “India is more prepared,” he said.","India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and PoK.

Jammu and Kashmir cops block Martyrs’ Day events at graveyard,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jammu-and-kashmir-cops-block-martyrs-day-events-at-graveyard/articleshow/122410871.cms,"File photo: J&K cops

SRINAGAR: J&K police has announced that no one will be allowed to visit the graveyard of “July 13 Martyrs” in Srinagar on Sunday, extending curbs that have been in place since the 2019 abrogation of Article 370. The date is significant in Kashmir’s history as 22 people were killed during an uprising against Dogra ruler Maharaja Hari Singh in 1931.Chief minister Omar Abdullah , his father and governing National Conference (NC) president Farooq Abdullah, and former CM Mehbooba Mufti were expected to visit Mazar-e-Shuhada, the martyrs’ resting place in Srinagar’s Naqshband Sahib and pay floral tributes. Authorities have already placed Hurriyat Conference chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq under house arrest.The Omar-led govt does not control police or security, whose reins are in the hands of the Centre-appointed lieutenant governor (LG) Manoj Sinha.“District administration Srinagar has denied permission to all applicants intending to proceed towards Nowhatta on 13th July, 2025 (Sunday). The general public is advised to strictly comply with these instructions. Any violation shall invite strict legal action,” J&K police said in a statement late Saturday evening.NC reacted sharply to the curbs, with spokesperson Tanvir Sadiq calling them “deeply unfortunate and fundamentally unjust” on a day of profound historical and emotional significance for people of J&K. “We urge the administration to reflect on the gravity of this decision. No order can suppress memory. No restriction can erase the truth. The people of Kashmir will continue to honour their martyrs peacefully, with dignity, and with unwavering resolve,” Sadiq said.NC had written to Srinagar’s deputy commissioner on Thursday, seeking permission for Farooq’s intended visit to the site. Apni Party had made a similar request.Fearing they would be restricted from leaving home on Sunday, PDP functionary and ex-CM Mehbooba’s daughter Iltija Mufti visited the graveyard on Saturday. “I paid tributes to our martyrs who laid down their lives for democracy. Their memory is being wilfully erased. Yet their voices echo in every Kashmiri’s heart,” Iltija said.In January 2020, nearly six months after the abrogation of Article 370, UT authorities had dropped July 13 and December 5 from the list of public holidays in J&K. December 5 was observed as the birth anniversary of NC founder Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah.Since then, the authorities have barred official functions on July 13 at Mazar-e-Shuhada, detaining politicians, including former chief ministers, if necessary, to keep them away. Earlier, it was tradition for CMs and top officials to pay tributes and offer a guard of honour at the graveyard.While such restrictions had been clamped in the past few years, many had believed this year might be different as it was the first time since the revocation of J&K’s special status under Article 370 that an elected government was in place in the Union territory. Eyes will be peeled on the Omar govt’s response to the Sinha-led administration’s move on Sunday.","The date is significant in Kashmir’s history as 22 people were killed during an uprising against Dogra ruler Maharaja Hari Singh in 1931.

Union Minister Chirag Paswan Gets Death Threat on Social Media Ahead of Bihar Polls. Files Complaint

Chirag vows to contest all 243 seats in Bihar

NEW DELHI: Union minister and Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) chief Chirag Paswan on Saturday lashed out at Bihar’s law and order situation, calling it “beyond understanding”. Chirag’s comments are the latest in a series of messages directed at the Nitish government since he announced his decision to contest the Bihar polls scheduled for later this year.“How many Biharis will be murdered? It is beyond understanding what is the responsibility of Bihar Police?” the Hajipur MP wrote on X, hours after the killing of Sushila Devi, a 60-year-old hospital worker shot dead in Nalanda on Saturday morning.Police said she was ambushed while returning from her farm, shot in the head, and declared dead at a local hospital. Officers suspect a property dispute but are still investigating.The incident is the latest in a string of high-profile killings across Bihar. A 50-year-old sand mining businessman was shot dead in Patna on Thursday, just days after top industrialist Gopal Khemka was murdered near his home despite earlier appeals for police protection. On Friday, another businessman, Vikram Jha, was gunned down outside his shop in Patna. “There seems to be no evidence of robbery,” Patna East SP Parichay Kumar said, adding that the motive remains unclear.Deputy CM Vijay Kumar Sinha had blamed “sand, liquor and land mafias” linked to the opposition RJD for the violence in the state. RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav, however, held the Nitish government accountable. “Why is the unconscious Chief Minister silent?” he posted on X.This is the second time in a week that Chirag has criticised the law and order situation in Bihar, with the LJP MP on Monday describing it as “completely collapsed.”“In Biharsharif, Nalanda, criminals brutally murdered 16-year-old Himanshu Paswan and 20-year-old Anu Kumar by shooting them. This incident is extremely unfortunate and condemnable. This heinous event not only shakes humanity but also shows that law and order in Bihar have completely collapsed,” Chirag had said.“Crime in the state is at its peak, and the fact that such an incident was carried out by criminals in the home district of the Honourable Chief Minister clearly indicates that the morale of criminals is at its highest,” he added.Chirag has declared that his party, the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), will contest all 243 assembly seats in Bihar, reaffirming his ‘Bihar First, Bihari First’ vision. Speaking at a rally in Chhapra, the Union minister said he would fight the polls with “full intensity.”His announcement has unsettled allies in the NDA, with JD(U) leaders accusing him of violating coalition dharma.""If Chirag wants to contest the elections on his own, he should declare it publicly. It is not right to say one thing on stage and another off stage. This should not happen. He is a Union minister in the NDA govt and should follow coalition dharma,"" said senior JD(U) leader and state IPRD minister Maheshwar Hazar on Friday.Also read: 'Chirag should clarify stand on fighting polls,' says JD(U) minister","Union minister and Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) chief Chirag Paswan on Saturday lashed out at Bihar’s law and order situation, calling it “beyond understanding” His comments are the latest in a series of messages directed at the Nitish government since he announced his decision to contest the Bihar polls scheduled for later this year.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122409153,imgsize-1228771,width-400,resizemode-4/122409153.jpg"

February 2025: Bondi distributes “Epstein Files: Phase 1” to influencers—mostly rehashed content May 2025: Bongino and Patel publicly align with suicide ruling July 7, 2025: DOJ memo affirms suicide, no client list, no charges pending July 9, 2025: Bondi and Bongino clash during White House meeting July 11, 2025: Bongino takes leave; resignation imminent July 12, 2025: Patel signals he may leave if Bongino quits

The Big Picture







The Trump administration is facing its most volatile internal crisis yet, as FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino edges closer to resignation over Attorney General Pam Bondi’s mishandling of the long-anticipated Epstein files. The fallout, driven by Bondi’s broken promises and growing public outrage, has FBI Director Kash Patel reportedly prepared to follow Bongino out the door—setting the stage for a possible leadership implosion at the heart of American law enforcement.This internal war—once quietly brewing—is now on full display, with recriminations flying, alliances shifting, and MAGA loyalists turning on their own.On July 7, the Department of Justice issued a memo that decisively undercut the narrative Bondi had been peddling for months. The two-page document concluded there was no evidence of a “client list,” no credible signs of blackmail, and reaffirmed the long-standing official position that Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide in a federal jail cell in 2019.The memo, signed off by both DOJ and FBI leadership, included surveillance footage and investigative summaries that contradicted Bondi’s earlier statements. For months, she had claimed the FBI was in possession of tens of thousands of hours of disturbing video footage, and had repeatedly promised bombshell disclosures.Those promises now appear to have been hollow.Conservative influencers, who had banked on explosive revelations implicating elites, were incensed. Bondi’s office had built expectations with Phase 1 of the “Epstein Files” back in February—a series of binders handed out to right-wing media figures that mostly repackaged previously leaked information. With the July memo’s flat conclusions, fury erupted.The conflict between Bongino and Bondi came to a head on July 9 during a closed-door White House meeting. Bondi accused Bongino of leaking frustrations to the press, an allegation he denied. Witnesses described the exchange as heated and personal, with Bongino storming out of the room.Two days later, Bongino took a personal day and has not returned. Multiple administration sources now say his resignation is imminent. One source described him as “done,” and unwilling to work another day under Bondi’s leadership. Bongino, a former Secret Service agent and a fixture in conservative media, had reluctantly endorsed the DOJ memo’s suicide conclusion, only to be caught in the backlash from MAGA influencers who accused him of selling out.FBI Director Kash Patel is also said to be considering resignation. Once a key proponent of theories questioning Epstein’s death, Patel has since aligned with the suicide explanation in his official capacity. However, insiders say he is privately furious at Bondi for damaging the Bureau’s credibility and igniting a crisis within the administration.Patel’s calculus is reportedly tied to Bongino’s fate. If his deputy resigns, Patel may follow, seeing little institutional value in continuing under Bondi’s divisive leadership. One aide close to the director said, “He doesn’t want to be left holding the bag. If Bongino goes, Kash walks too.”Bondi, once lionised by MAGA world as a crusading truth-teller, now finds herself isolated. Online, influencers and activists who once supported her are accusing her of deceit. Hashtags attacking her flooded conservative corners of social media in the days following the memo’s release. Even voices that typically defend the Trump administration have begun to call for her resignation.What makes the backlash particularly potent is that Bondi had personally staked her reputation on the idea that the Epstein files contained smoking guns. Now that official documentation has concluded otherwise, she has lost the confidence of both the public and senior officials inside the administration.Donald Trump has so far refused to intervene. During a cabinet meeting on July 8, he reportedly urged his team to “move on” from the Epstein issue, calling it a distraction from his legislative agenda. While the president continues to publicly back Bondi, insiders say he’s well aware of her declining utility. Trump’s political instincts have always been sharper than his personal loyalties—and Bondi may soon find herself on the wrong side of that calculation.This isn’t just about Epstein. It’s about trust, credibility, and the fault lines within the Trump-era security state. Bondi’s promise of transparency has backfired, alienating the very audience it was meant to appease. Bongino’s looming exit and Patel’s wavering loyalty signal a broader collapse of cohesion at the top. With two of the administration’s most prominent law enforcement figures ready to walk and the base in open revolt, Pam Bondi’s position may no longer be tenable. And while the Epstein case may be officially closed, the political aftershocks are far from over.","The Trump administration is facing its most volatile internal crisis yet.

Ovidio Guzman Lopez: Drug lord 'El Chapo's' son pleads guilty; admits to drug trafficking charges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ovidio-guzmn-lpe-drug-lord-el-chapos-son-pleads-guilty-admits-to-drug-trafficking-charges/articleshow/122399341.cms,"Ovidio Guzman Lopez (AP image)





Ovidio Guzman Lopez, the son of notorious Mexican drug lord “El Chapo” pleaded guilty on Friday (local time) to drug trafficking charges in the United States. He is the first of El Chapo’s sons to agree to a plea deal with US prosecutors.Prosecutors say Ovidio and his brother, Joaquín Guzmán López, led a faction of the Sinaloa cartel known as the “Chapitos” or “little Chapos.” Authorities described their operation as a major effort to smuggle huge amounts of fentanyl into the US, contributing to tens of thousands of overdose deaths every year.As part of the plea deal, Ovidio admitted to overseeing the production and trafficking of cocaine, heroin , methamphetamine, marijuana and fentanyl into the US. He also pleaded guilty to money laundering and firearms charges connected to his leadership role in the cartel.The specific terms of the agreement, including possible sentencing reductions or cooperation agreements, were not immediately disclosed. However, officials said sentencing has been delayed as Ovidio cooperates with US authorities.His lawyer, Jeffrey Lichtman, said he would wait until sentencing before discussing whether it was a good deal.Lichtman also pointed out that the case against Ovidio’s brother Joaquín is different and might take longer to resolve.“Remember, Joaquin was arrested in America well after Ovidio was, so it takes time,” Lichtman said.Laurie Levenson, a law professor at Loyola Law School and former assistant US attorney in Los Angeles, said Ovidio’s guilty plea might have helped protect his family members.“In this way, he has some control over who he’s cooperating against and what the world will know about that cooperation.”Levenson described the plea deal as a “big step” for the US government.Meanwhile, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on Friday criticized what she called a “lack of coherence” in American policy toward Mexican cartels. She pointed out the contradiction between the US labeling cartels as foreign terrorist organizations while also making plea deals with their leaders.Ovidio Guzmán López was arrested in Mexico in 2023 and extradited to the United States. He had first pleaded not guilty but signaled in recent months that he would change his plea.His father, Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, is serving a life sentence in the US after being convicted in 2019 for leading the Sinaloa cartel and having smuggled massive amount of cocaine and other drugs into the United States for over 25 years.","Ovidio Guzman Lopez, the son of notorious Mexican drug lord “El Chapo” pleaded guilty on Friday (local time) to drug trafficking charges in the United States.

Who is BabyHaze?

BabyHaze got knocked out on the streets of Tokyo

“Leave me the f**k alone,”

Stolen phone and social media reactions

The sexual assault allegations from South Korea spark online debate

Somali's New Excuse & BabyHaze's Criminal Saga Begins (LIVE)

Kick streamer BabyHaze, also known online as “BabyHaze69,” is once again in the spotlight, and this time, not for the reasons he’d like. Known for his chaotic IRL streams and wild antics, BabyHaze is now at the center of a viral moment that saw him getting knocked out cold on a busy street in Japan. But the knockout is just the surface.For those unfamiliar, BabyHaze is no stranger to controversy. He’s frequently collaborated with polarizing streamer Ice Poseidon, and his “Just Chatting” streams on Kick have been described as chaotic at best and problematic at worst. He’s even earned the label of a “nuisance streamer” from sections of the internet. And recently, things took a much darker turn.It all went down in Tokyo’s bustling Shibuya district on July 12, 2025. A short 44-second video started circulating on Reddit’s r/LivestreamFail, where viewers watched in disbelief as fellow Kick streamer Karumo confronted BabyHaze over an alleged assault.In the now-viral clip, Karumo is seen stepping up to BabyHaze and accusing him of attacking his friend. Things escalated fast.After BabyHaze barked,Karumo responded with a clean punch to the face, knocking him flat onto the pavement.The livestream didn’t end there, though. In a bizarre twist, an elderly Japanese man casually walked up, picked up BabyHaze’s phone, and wandered off, with the stream still rolling. The stream, still active as the older man explored Shibuya with the phone, became a surreal watch party for X users.Viewers watched in real time as the man inspected the phone, tried to make sense of the interface, and eventually brought it back to his home, where the stream finally ended.The reactions were split. Some laughed, some cringed, and others questioned the state of streaming culture.This very public takedown also pulled older controversies back into the spotlight. Just a month earlier, legal YouTuber Andrew “Legal Mindset” had gone live to discuss sexual assault allegations previously made against BabyHaze during his time in South Korea.According to the discussion, the accusations were reportedly made six years ago and later ruled in his favor, with the South Korean government allegedly covering his legal costs after the accuser was convicted of false reporting.Still, clips of BabyHaze awkwardly trying to explain the situation, sometimes denying, sometimes halfway acknowledging it, have resurfaced and gone viral again.Between assault claims, livestream drama, and getting decked on the streets of Tokyo, BabyHaze is spiraling into headline after headline.","Kick streamer BabyHaze, also known online as “BabyHaze69,” is once again in the spotlight, and this time, not for the reasons he’d like.

BALASORE: A 20-year-old student of a govt college in Balasore district sustained critical burn injuries after she allegedly set herself on fire outside the college premises on Saturday over alleged sexual harassment by a teacher.A male student, who tried to save her, also sustained burn injuries. Police have arrested the teacher while the govt has suspended the college principal as well as the accused. The condition of the girl, who has been shifted to AIIMS Bhubaneswar with 90% burns, is said to be critical.The second-year student of integrated BEd programme apparently tried to kill herself following prolonged harassment by a senior faculty member and alleged institutional apathy towards her complaints.According to witnesses, she set herself ablaze near the main gate of the college during a peaceful protest that had been going on since July 1 demanding action against the head of the education department (HoD).Students and friends of the girl claimed she had previously filed complaints accusing the HoD of mental harassment, misbehaviour and threats to manipulate her academic performance by lowering her internal marks unless she gave in to his sexual demands.""She told us multiple times that she was being harassed by the head of the department. He allegedly demanded undue favours and threatened to fail her if she didn't comply,"" said a fellow student, who had witnessed the horrifying scene.The incident occurred shortly after noon. Witnesses said the girl briefly walked away from the protest site, doused herself in petrol and set herself on fire. CCTV footage showed the student setting herself ablaze, then running toward the principal's office, and later through the campus before being rescued by some students.Panic ensued as students rushed to douse the flames. A male student sustained injuries while trying to save her.The two injured were initially taken to Balasore district headquarters hospital. Given that the girl had sustained over 90% burns, she was shifted to AIIMS Bhubaneswar for advanced treatment.The incident triggered widespread outrage across the campus. Students accused the college administration of gross negligence, alleging that their classmate's earlier complaints were ignored or poorly handled. Although an internal committee was reportedly formed to probe the allegations, students claimed it was biased and lacked transparency.The college principal said the girl had approached him with complaints some days back. ""She met me again on Saturday around 11 am and expressed severe distress. I summoned the teacher and spoke with both parties. Shortly after she left my office, we heard screams,"" the principal said, adding, ""Internal complaint committee did not find conclusive evidence of sexual harassment.""In the principal's suspension order, the higher education department stated that ""he has failed to perform his duties in the capacity of principal of the college"". It added that ""the matter has not been handled properly"".The principal has been barred from leaving Balsore without the district collector's permission. The accused teacher's suspension order said it was based on ""prima facie evidence"".DIG (eastern range), Satyajit Naik, said the accused faculty member has been arrested and booked for abetment to suicide attempt and sexual harassment. A forensic team visited the site, and a detailed investigation is underway. ""Law and order is being strictly maintained on the college campus,"" Naik said.","A 20-year-old student of a govt college in Balasore district sustained critical burn injuries after she allegedly set herself on fire.

Epstein files controversy:





US President Donald Trump has urged his supporters and allies to stop attacking Attorney General Pam Bondi, saying she is doing an excellent job and should be allowed to focus on her work. In a lengthy post on Truth Social, Trump appealed for unity within the MAGA movement and criticized the renewed controversy over Jeffrey Epstein’s files, which has sparked deepening clashes between the FBI and the department of justice.""Let Pam Bondi do her job — she's great!"" Trump wrote, making a direct plea as tensions reportedly rose within federal law enforcement. According to media reports, speculation has been growing that FBI director Kash Patel may be considering resigning from his post after much anticipation that FBI deputy director Dan Bongino may also step down amid the turmoil over handling of Epstein-related documents.Addressing his supporters directly, Trump questioned why so many were targeting Bondi despite her record. He called for Republicans to remain united instead of fighting among themselves. “What’s going on with my ‘boys’ and, in some cases, ‘gals?’ They’re all going after Attorney General Pam Bondi, who is doing a fantastic job! We’re on one Team, MAGA, and I don’t like what’s happening,” he wrote.Trump claimed that his administration is highly successful and well-regarded globally but argued that “selfish people” are undermining it by stirring up controversy about Epstein. He accused prominent political opponents including former US President Barack Obama , former secretary of state Hillary Clinton , former FBI Director James Comey, former CIA director John Brennan and officials from the former US President Joe Biden administration of manufacturing the drama over the so-called “Epstein Files.”“For years, it’s Epstein, over and over again,” Trump said, suggesting the focus on Epstein is a political distraction. He questioned why, if any damaging evidence existed in the Epstein files, his opponents did not release it to hurt the MAGA movement. He also linked this controversy to past disputes over unreleased government records such as the John F Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr files.Trump further accused his rivals of using similar tactics in the past, pointing to the Steele Dossier and the “Russia Hoax,” and claimed his critics were trying to divide his supporters. He argued that despite his administration’s successes which included border security, deportations of criminals, economic growth, energy dominance and efforts to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons some people are never satisfied.“No matter how much success we have had … it’s never enough for some people,” he wrote. He further added that he expects his administration to achieve more in six months than any other administration has in a century.Trump called on his allies to stay focused on what he described as key priorities: investigating voter fraud, political corruption, ActBlue, and what he continues to claim was a “rigged and stolen” 2020 election. He argued that Bondi’s work on these issues is vital and should not be disrupted by internal fighting or the renewed attention on Epstein.He concluded by urging his supporters to stop wasting time and energy on Epstein, whom he claimed “nobody cares about,” and to focus instead on what he described as the ongoing mission to save the country and make America great again.Earlier, reports suggested that Patel is furious with Bondi’s handling of the Epstein files. He is said to be frustrated that Bondi has not unsealed more records related to the case and has told associates he wants her removed from her position.Patel has publicly stated that the FBI’s review of evidence showed that Epstein was not murdered, pushing back against conspiracy theories about Epstein’s 2019 death in jail.The controversy erupted after the FBI and DOJ issued a joint memo declaring the Epstein case officially closed, stating he died by suicide and there was no evidence of homicide. The announcement angered many MAGA commentators including FBI director Kash Patel and his deputy Dan Bongino who refuse to accept that there is no “client list” of powerful individuals who visited Epstein’s island or were involved in sex trafficking of minors.For years, Patel and Bongino have suggested there was more to be revealed about the Epstein case. Bondi herself previously claimed she had an Epstein “client list” on her desk for review. However, after the case was closed, Bondi clarified that she was referring to the broader set of Epstein-related documents, not a specific client list.(This is a top Google Trends topic.)","US President Donald Trump has urged his supporters and allies to stop attacking Attorney General Pam Bondi.

Axios reported that this is exactly what Bongino internally said as he has been skipping work after Wednesday's meeting at the White House where the Epstein fallout was discussed threadbare and Dan Bongino left the meeting angry. Speculations that Dan Bongino will resign gave in to theories that FBI director Kash Patel will also resign as Bongino is his right-hand person and Patel too agrees with Bongino's sentiment that he is being blamed over the situation unfairly.

If we lose 10 percent of the MAGA movement right now, we ain’t gonna … we’re gonna lose 40 seats in 2026,” he told a live audience during his “War Room” podcast.“We’re gonna lose the president,” Bannon added.The statement came hours before Trump in a Truth Social post accused former Presidents Barack Obama, Joe Biden and also Hilary Clinton for the mess without any evidence.“Why are we giving publicity to Files written by Obama, Crooked Hillary, Comey, Brennan, and the Losers and Criminals of the Biden Administration, who conned the World with the Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax, 51 “Intelligence” Agents, “THE LAPTOP FROM HELL,” and more?” Trump said.“They created the Epstein Files, just like they created the FAKE Hillary Clinton/Christopher Steele Dossier that they used on me, and now my so-called “friends” are playing right into their hands,” he added.That shift could threaten the Republican majority won last November. The GOP has a slim 220-212 majority in the House over Democrats. After major 2024 losses, Democrats are aiming to regain House and Senate seats, and controversy over the Epstein case along with backlash to the GOP’s recent “big, beautiful” spending cuts could fuel their 2026 campaign.“They don’t even have to steal it, which they’re gonna try to do in ’28, because they’re gonna sit there and they go … they’ve disheartened the hardest core populist nation that’s always been who governs us,” Bannon added.While speaking on podcast Bannon also weighed in on apparent infighting in White House, citing them as one of the reasons for chipping away the MAGA vote from Republicans.Some recent reports have suggested that FBI director Kash Patel, and his deputy Dan Boigino are upset with US attorney general Pam Bondi led DOJ, over her claims on Epstein filesOn Monday, the justice department (DOJ) and FBI released a memo concluding their investigation, stating that Jeffrey Epstein did not maintain a client list and confirming that he died by suicide in his New York City jail cell in 2019.Bondi, who stood by the memo’s findings during a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, is facing criticism after previously claiming she had a list of names “sitting on her desk.”Trump and others in his administration have defended her, despite calls for her removal and reports from CNN and Semafor that FBI deputy director Dan Bongino was outraged over the Epstein files controversy, considered resigning, and skipped work on Friday.","Bannon warned that Republicans could ""lose 40 house seats"" in next years mid- term elections, over the handling of Jeffrey Epstein case files.

Iranians SHAME Pezeshkian For ‘Conveying Tehran’s Weakness’ To U.S. | ‘Submissive, Weak President’





President Donald Trump Friday referred to defense secretary Pete Hegseth as the secretary of war, leading to confusion as to whether it was slip or whether Trump wants to bring back the position that the country didn't have since 1947. ""Secretary of War Pete Hegseth was great on FoxNews this morning. Talking about modern weapons and warfare. Thank you also to Brett Velicovich, who really knows his “stuff.” We are really on our way. MAGA!"" Trump posted on Truth Social.The position of Secretary of War was a high‑level cabinet role in the U.S. government from 1789 until its dissolution in 1947. Initially, while serving under the Articles of Confederation (1781–1789), it was known as “Secretary at War.” Benjamin Lincoln and Henry Knox held the rank during this early period. Under the new Constitution, George Washington appointed Henry Knox as the first official Secretary of War, entrusting him with all military affairs—including naval matters—until the Department of the Navy was created in 1798.The office was eventually discontinued by the National Security Act of 1947, which split its duties into the newly formed Secretary of the Army and Secretary of the Air Force, both reporting to the Secretary of Defense, who now occupies the cabinet-level role.The final Secretary of War, Kenneth C. Royall, briefly served in that role in 1947 before transitioning to become the first Secretary of the Army.Hegseth has issued a new directive to increase the arsenal of drones. On Thursday, he spoke about it as a drone came to hand him a memo which Hegseth then signed. The memo was titled ""Unleasing US Military Drone Dominance"". “This is the future,” he declared. “We’re in the fight. We’re in the fight to win it. And we’re never gonna back down.""","The position of Secretary of War was a high‑level cabinet role in the U.S. government from 1789 until its dissolution in 1947.

A federal judge in Los Angeles issued a temporary order barring US immigration authorities from stopping people for questioning without cause, the latest fallout from the Trump administration's controversial crackdown on migrants.A temporary restraining order sought by a group of Southern California residents, workers and advocacy groups was granted Friday by US district judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong.The judge barred agents in the Los Angeles area from stopping and questioning individuals without reasonable suspicion that they're in the US illegally.

At least 66 people have been killed in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo by rebels linked to the Islamic State group, local officials said on Saturday.Fighters from the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), an Islamist group with ties to IS, attacked civilians in the Irumu area of Ituri province, which borders Uganda. The attack comes as eastern Congo may see an end to its ongoing war with the M23 rebel group, which is backed by neighbouring country Rwanda.Jean Tobie Okala, spokesperson for the United Nations mission in Ituri, described the attack as a “bloodbath.”“Around 30 civilians were killed between Thursday and Friday, July 11, in the Walese Vonkutu chiefdom, Irumu territory, in Ituri,” Okala said, as reported by news agency AP.""Based on information from civil society, the death toll has risen from 31 to 66 civilians killed,” he added.The ADF is a Ugandan Islamist group that operates on both sides of the porous border. Marcel Paluku, president of a local civil society group, said all of the victims including women were killed with machetes. The number of people taken hostage remains unknown.Officials suspect the attack was in retaliation for a recent bombing campaign by joint Congolese and Ugandan forces that began on Sunday.In recent years, ADF attacks have intensified along the border with Uganda and have spread toward Goma, the main city in eastern Congo, as well as the neighbouring Ituri province. Rights groups and the United Nations have accused the ADF of killing hundreds of people and abducting many more, including large numbers of children.","Fighters from the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), an Islamist group with ties to IS, attacked civilians in the Irumu area of Ituri province, which borders Uganda.

The US State Department on Friday (local time) laid off more than 1,300 employees as part of the Trump administration’s latest move to cut its American workforce by about 15%. This is part of a broader effort to reorganize the department.According to a notice sent to State department employees, the layoffs include 1107 civil service employees and 246 foreign service officers. Overall, nearly 3000 people are expected to leave.The department is also rearranging the organizational structure of staff. These layoffs, officially called a “reduction-in-force” or RIF, have been planned for months. Officials sent the reorganization plan to Congress in March, saying the cuts were necessary to remove duplicate offices and focus on the department’s core responsibilities.However, critics argue the cuts will hurt the State Department’s ability to work. All Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee sent a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday opposing the layoffs.""During a time of increasingly complex and wide-spread challenges to U.S. national security, this administration should be strengthening our diplomatic corps—an irreplaceable instrument of U.S. power and leadership—not weakening it,"" the senators wrote.""However, RIFs would severely undermine the Department's ability to achieve U.S. foreign policy interests, putting our nation's security, strength, and prosperity at risk,"" the letter added, as reported by news agency CBS.Foreign service officers who received layoff notices will leave their jobs in 120 days, while civil service employees will depart in 60 days.The long planned layoffs began just days after the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration’s broader plan to slash the size of government workforce, overruling a lower court's order that halted layoff plans at dozens of federal agencies.Department staff were notified about the upcoming layoffs on Thursday afternoon in a message from Deputy Secretary of State Michael Rigas, who thanked departing staff ""for their dedication and service to the United States.""Some employees were instructed that because of the planned layoffs, they would not be allowed to work remotely on Friday. They were told to report to the office with all department-issued items, including laptops, phones, diplomatic passports, travel cards and other government property. An email explained that badges would be collected during the checkout process and reminded staff to gather any personal belongings beforehand.Diplomats and other staff applauded departing colleagues in emotional scenes at the State Department’s Washington headquarters that runs US foreign policy and embassies around the world.The American Foreign Service Association (AFSA), the union representing State Department employees, criticized the move as a “catastrophic blow to our national interests.”""At a moment of great global instability -- with war raging in Ukraine, conflict between Israel and Iran, and authoritarian regimes testing the boundaries of international order -- the United States has chosen to gut its frontline diplomatic workforce,"" AFSA said in a statement.""We oppose this decision in the strongest terms,"" the statement added.","US State Department laid off more than 1,300 employees as part of the Trump administration’s latest move to cut its American workforce by about 15%.

The O'Keefe Media Group has released an audio featuring Rami Hassan, deputy senior National Intelligence Officer at the FBI, in which he is admitting that law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, may have mishandled the Jeffrey Epstein investigation.The leaked audio recording comes amid tensions between law enforcement and political figures over the Justice Department’s decision to officially close the Epstein case.“I’m with FBI. It’s a shit show, it's just messy, like, you can see where law enforcement kind of either turned a blind eye or like missed things (on Epstein) and there’s an opportunity just from like hearing and listening,” Hassan said in the audio.“They (FBI) were trying to release some of the files, like the White House was,” he added.Hassan also mentioned that the White House was planning to release documents related to the case and that right-wing influencers were being invited to help publicize the material.“They even invited some of the influencers, right wing bloggers and to release the files, that seems a little weird. Just release it online,” said Hassan.A joint memo released last week by the DOJ and FBI concluded that Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide and found no evidence of foul play. The memo also stated that there was no “client list” connected to Epstein’s sex trafficking activities and no credible proof that he blackmailed influential figures.“This systematic review revealed no incriminating ‘client list.’ There was also no credible evidence found that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals,” said the memo.FBI chief Kash Patel and deputy director Dan Bongino have both rejected its findings, particularly the claim that no client list exists. According to The Daily Wire, Patel is now considering resignation over what he views as a mishandling of Epstein-related documents.Bongino is also reportedly weighing a departure. Sources close to him say he has grown increasingly frustrated, especially after a heated confrontation with attorney general Pam Bondi regarding the case.

Russia’s foreign minister Sergey Lavrov visited North Korea on Saturday, and warned the United States, South Korea, and Japan against forming a security alliance aimed at Moscow's ally.Lavrov met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in the eastern coastal city of Wonsan, delivering greetings from Russian President Vladimir Putin. During the meeting, Kim reaffirmed North Korea’s full support for Russia’s war in Ukraine, saying both Moscow and Pyongyang shared “identical views on all strategic issues in conformity with the level of alliance,” according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).Lavrov also called for greater “strategic and tactical cooperation” between Russia and North Korea, and highlighted their alignment on international affairs. He also accused the US, South Korea, and Japan of escalating military pressure on North Korea.“We warn against exploiting these ties to build alliances directed against anyone, including North Korea and, of course, Russia,” he said, according to Russia's state Tass news agency.Lavrov’s remarks come as the US, South Korea, and Japan ramped up joint military drills in response to North Korea’s expanding nuclear program. Just days earlier, the three allies held a joint air exercise near the Korean Peninsula involving US nuclear-capable bombers.North Korea views such exercises as rehearsals for invasion and insists its nuclear weapons are necessary for self-defense. Lavrov backed that stance, saying Russia understands Pyongyang’s reasoning.“The technologies used by North Korea are the result of the work of its own scientists. We respect its aspirations and understand the reasons why it is pursuing nuclear development,” Lavrov said.During separate talks, with his counterpart Choe Son Hui, Lavrov thanked North Korea for what he said was its contribution during a Ukrainian attack on Russia’s Kursk region.The meeting was held in Wonsan, where North Korea recently unveiled a large beach resort as part of efforts to boost tourism. Lavrov said he hopes Russian tourists will begin visiting the area and pledged to support increased travel through improved air connections.","Russia's foreign minister Sergey Lavrov visited North Korea on Saturday.

EU says it still wants US trade deal





US President Donald Trump on Saturday announced he's levying tariffs of 30 per cent against the European Union and Mexico starting Aug 1, a move that could cause massive upheaval between US and two of its biggest trade partners.Trump detailed the planned tariffs in letters posted to his social media account. They are part of an announcement blitz by Trump of new tariffs with allies and foes alike, a bedrock of his 2024 campaign that he said would set the foundation for reviving a US economy that he claims has been ripped off by other nations for decades.In his letter to Mexico's leader, President Claudia Sheinbaum, Trump acknowledged that the country has been helpful in stemming the flow of undocumented migrants and fentanyl into US. But he said the country has not done enough to stop North America from turning into a ""narco-trafficking playground"".""Mexico has been helping me secure the border, BUT, what Mexico has done, is not enough,"" Trump added.Trump in his letter to the European Union said that the US trade deficit was a national security threat.""We have had years to discuss our Trading Relationship with The European Union, and we have concluded we must move away from these long-term, large, and persistent, Trade Deficits, engendered by your Tariff, and Non-Tariff, Policies, and Trade Barriers,"" Trump wrote in the letter to the EU.""Our relationship has been, unfortunately, far from Reciprocal.""The letters come in the midst of an on-and-off Trump threat to impose tariffs on countries and right an imbalance in trade. Trump in April imposed tariffs on dozens of countries, before pausing them for 90 days to negotiate individual deals. As the three-month grace period ended this week, Trump began sending his tariff letters to leaders but again has pushed back the implementation day for what he says will be just a few more weeks.If he moves forward with the tariffs, it could have ramifications for nearly every aspect of the global economy.European Union Commission president Ursula von der Leyen responded by noting the bloc's ""commitment to dialogue, stability, and a constructive transatlantic partnership.""""At the same time, we will take all necessary steps to safeguard EU interests, including the adoption of proportionate countermeasures if required,"" von der Leyen said in a statement.Von der Leyen added that the EU remains committed to continuing negotiations with the US and coming to an agreement before Aug 1. Trade ministers from EU countries are scheduled to meet Monday to discuss trade relations with the US, as well as with China.European leaders joined von der Leyen in urging Trump to give negotiations more time and warnings of possible new tariffs on Washington. ""With European unity, it is more than ever up to the Commission to assert the Union's determination to resolutely defend European interests,"" French President Emmanuel Macron said in a statement posted on X.Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni's office said ""it would make no sense to trigger a trade war between the two sides of the Atlantic"".European leaders had held out hope that they would avoid receiving a letter, and that a deal would be worked out. The bloc collectively sells more to the US than any other country.US goods imports from the EU topped $553 billion in 2022, according to the Office of the US Trade Representative. Europe’s biggest exports to the US were pharmaceuticals, cars, aircraft, chemicals, medical instruments and spirits.Trump has complained about the EU’s 198 billion-euro trade surplus in goods, which shows Americans buy more goods from Europe than the other way around. However, American companies fill some of the gap by outselling the EU when it comes to services such as cloud computing, travel bookings, and legal and financial services. With the reciprocal tariffs, Trump is effectively blowing up the rules governing world trade.For decades, the United States and most other countries abided by tariff rates set through a series of complex negotiations known as the Uruguay round. Countries could set their own tariffs, but under the “most favoured nation” approach, they couldn’t charge one country more than they charged another","US President Donald Trump announced he's levying tariffs of 30 per cent against the European Union and Mexico starting Aug 1.

PESHAWAR: An under-construction government primary school for girls in Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province was damaged in an IED blast by unknown militants, police said on Friday.No casualties were reported as the building was unoccupied at the time of the explosion.Militants had planted an explosive material inside the premises of the Azaan Javed Primary School in Baka Khel police jurisdiction of Bannu district.The device was detonated with a powerful blast, causing substantial structural damage to the building.An FIR has been registered and forensic teams have been deployed to collect evidence from the blast site, police said.Authorities have condemned the attack as an attempt to derail educational development in the region.According to a report by the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank, more than 1,100 girls' schools have been destroyed in the tribal areas between 2007 to 2017, with teachers and young students also targeted.Before an all-out military operation launched by Pakistan's security forces in 2014, the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) carried out hundreds of attacks on girls' schools in the tribal areas and settled districts of the northwestern province from its stronghold in Swat district.After the crackdown, TTP militants fled to Afghanistan and began to orchestrate cross border attacks from their new sanctuaries.The Taliban takeover of Kabul has emboldened the TTP, which is fighting to regain control of its strongholds in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Since the takeover of Afghanistan in 2021, the Taliban has banned girls from attending school beyond the sixth grade and banned women from universities.Pakistani Taliban, who are ideologically closer to Afghan Taliban, are trying to enforce a similar anti-education and theocratic agenda in Pakistan's tribal areas by force.The youngest Nobel Prize laureate, Malala Yousafzai, who is from Swat district, was shot in the face when she was 14 by TTP gunmen in 2012 as she wanted to pursue her education.","Militants planted an explosive material inside the premises of the Azaan Javed Primary School.

Nine people were shot dead by rebels in Pakistan’s Balochistan province late Thursday after they were pulled off passenger buses. The victims were targeted based on their identity cards showing Punjab origins, as per reports.According to Dawn, two buses travelling from Quetta to Punjab were intercepted near Sur-Dakai along the Loralai-Zhob highway. Armed men reportedly blocked the road, boarded the vehicles, and began checking passengers’ CNICs.Those identified as residents of Punjab were taken off at gunpoint and later killed. “The terrorists forced the two passenger buses to stop on a highway and pulled nine passengers out. They took them in an area nearby and killed all of them,” said local official Naveed Alam, speaking to AFP.District administrator Saadat Hussain confirmed that the bodies were later recovered from the roadside. “The forces found the dead bodies all belong to different areas of Punjab,” he told AFP.“The terrorists must have taken the passengers’ identification documents with them,” AC Alam told Dawn.While no group initially claimed responsibility, the Balochistan Liberation Front (BLA) later took credit. The group has waged a long-running insurgency against the Pakistani state, frequently targeting non-Baloch civilians and military personnel.The Baloch insurgency, which seeks independence from Islamabad, has intensified in recent years despite claims by Pakistani authorities that it is under control. President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the killings, blaming “terrorists from the outlawed BLA” for seeking to destabilise the country.The killings echo a similar attack last year in which 23 passengers were killed. Human rights groups and separatists have accused Pakistan’s security forces of brutal counter-insurgency tactics, including enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings.","Nine people were shot dead by rebels in Pakistan’s Balochistan province.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s political temperature spiked on Thursday after Jemima Goldsmith, ex-wife of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan , accused the govt of denying their sons the right to speak with their father and threatening them with arrest if they attempt to visit the country.In a strongly worded post on X, Goldsmith said her sons, Sulaiman and Qasim Khan, have not been allowed to speak to Imran, who has been held in solitary confinement in Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail for nearly two years.“Pakistan’s govt has now said if they go there to try to see him, they too will be arrested and put behind bars,” she wrote. “This isn’t politics. It’s a personal vendetta.”Her intervention has triggered widespread reactions both domestically and abroad, with PTI accusing govt of using intimidation tactics ahead of a major protest planned for Aug 5 to mark two years of Khan’s incarceration.Reports suggest the sons, currently based in the UK, were planning to join the protest movement. However, Goldsmith’s statement appears to signal serious concern about their safety.Adviser to the Prime Minister on political affairs Rana Sanaullah, responding to the claims, said: “Why won’t they be arrested? If they come to lead a violent movement, the consequences will follow.” Law minister Aqeel Malik also warned that entry could be denied if their intent is to “spread discord”.Goldsmith’s post has reignited criticism of Khan’s detention conditions, with human rights groups raising an alarm over his prolonged solitary confinement — reportedly 22 hours a day — and limited access to lawyers and family. Khan’s son Qasim also weighed in, posting: “My father... has now spent over 700 days in prison – held in solitary confinement.”The row comes amid intense political speculation in Islamabad, including unconfirmed reports of President Asif Ali Zardari ’s possible resignation and a rumoured meeting between Khan and longtime rival Nawaz Sharif in jail.Interior minister Mohsin Naqvi has rejected the reports, calling them part of a “malicious foreign campaign” and denying claims that Army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir is being considered for the presidency under a proposed shift to a presidential system, a move Khan has condemned as “monarchic”.Khan, who faces over 150 legal cases, has rejected any negotiations with the Shehbaz Sharif govt. His sister, Aleema Khan, claims he and his wife, Bushra Bibi, are being held without access to sunlight, visitors, or even newspapers.",Imran Khan's ex-wife Jemima Goldsmith accuses govt of 'personal vendetta' She claims sons Sulaiman and Qasim Khan have not been allowed to speak to their father.

ISLAMABAD: Alphabet-owned YouTube has told more than two dozen critics of the Pakistani govt that it is considering blocking their channels after a local court sought to ban them for being ""anti-state"".The channels that could be blocked include that of the main opposition party, of its chief, jailed former PM Imran Khan, and journalists critical of govt, according to a June 24 court order. The judicial magistrate court in Islamabad said it was seeking the ban after national cyber crime investigation agency criticised the channels in a report for ""sharing highly provocative and derogatory contents against state institutions and officials of state of Pakistan"".Rights campaigners say any ban would further undermine free speech in Pakistan, where authorities are accused of stifling newspapers and television, and social media is seen as one of the few outlets for dissent. YouTube told 27 content creators their channels could be taken down if they did not comply with the court orders. State minister for interior Talal Chaudhry said the creators would also face criminal charges. ""It's not only about anchors getting fired or YouTube channels getting banned. It's what they are not allowing to be told and the rights abuse they are trying to hide from the world,"" said a spokesman for Khan's PTI.","YouTube has told more than two dozen critics of the Pakistani govt that it is considering blocking their channels.

India's Big Win In Pak Clash? Jaish Chief Masood Azhar's Brother Rauf 'Eliminated' In Op Sindoor





Pakistan’s former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar faced an uncomfortable moment during a recent Al Jazeera interview as she attempted to defend a man, seen leading funeral prayers for terrorists killed in India's counterterror Operation Sindoor.The individual, widely identified as senior Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) leader Hafiz Abdul Rauf, a UN-designated terrorist, was seen leading funeral prayers for terrorists killed in the Operation Sindoor strikes, where the bodies were accorded full state honours in Pakistan, with uniformed police and army personnel in attendance.Khar claimed the man in question was not the LeT figure India accuses him of being. ""I am telling you with authority, with evidence which has been shared with the whole world, that this is not the man that you (India) are claiming it to be. There are a million Abdul Raufs in Pakistan,"" she said, dismissing India's assertion.However, her defence began to falter when the interviewer pointed out that the man's national ID number matches one listed on the US Treasury Department's sanctions database.The journalist mentioned that the national identity number belonging to Hafiz Abdul Rauf -- 35202-5400413-9 -- was identical to the one listed by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the US Treasury’s list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGT).""They said that he is a member of a political party, and they released his national ID number. That ID number is the same one as on the US sanctions list. So, according to the US sanctions terrorist list, this man is a terrorist,"" the journalist said.Pressed further, Khar responded, ""The Pakistani army is defending this man. The Pakistani army is not defending the person who is proscribed by the US.""She continued, ""The ISPR (Inter-Services Public Relations of Pakistan Army) categorically has said that this is not the same person, and you just sat over here and told me that they just defended him and did not say it is not the same person.""The man at the centre of the controversy, Hafiz Abdul Rauf, is known to be a close associate of 26/11 mastermind Hafiz Saeed and holds senior status in the LeT. The presence of his identity number in the official document shown by Pakistan’s military spokesperson, DG ISPR Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif, matched that of the terrorist sanctioned by the United States.Under Operation Sindoor, India carried out precision strikes on nine terrorist hubs in Pakistan and PoK, including a major Lashkar-e-Taiba base in Muridke, which was reduced to rubble.In an unexpected revelation, the same US list also names Lt Gen Sharif’s father, Mahmood Sultan Bashiruddin, as a designated terrorist with links to al-Qaida -- further raising questions about the Pakistani military’s role in shielding extremists.","Pakistan’s former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar faced an uncomfortable moment during a recent Al Jazeera interview.
