However, what transpired next left him stunned.“I met with an accident and got injured. Since there’s no one else to help, I called my father, who is paralysed, to be with me,” Manish said. “My surgery was scheduled for Saturday, so I asked him to sit and wait outside the operation theatre.""I was inside the OT—I don’t know what happened, but now my father has 5–6 stitches on him,” he added.The patient further said that he does not remember the name of the doctor who performed the operation.""I don't remember the name of the doctor who operated on me.

KOLKATA: Calcutta HC has reversed the dismissal of an RPF constable whose comments on Facebook allegedly eulogised a colleague for gunning down a senior during the 2018 Meghalaya elections and warned of a ""mutiny"". HC held in its order on Wednesday that the accused did not receive a fair hearing, reports Srishti Lakhotia.HC asked RPF to conduct proper disciplinary hearings within eight weeks given the fact that the constable had denied making the comments. The constable, deployed at Purulia under South Eastern Railway before his dismissal, had moved the HC bench of Justice Raja Basu Chowdhury against his sacking of May 2, 2018, and an appellate authority order upholding the same later. RPF had alleged his comments led to the spread of hatred among ranks.Souvik Nandi, senior advocate representing Centre, had contended that the disciplinary authority was of the view that ""...if departmental action is delayed further, the delinquent constable's conduct will lead to hooliganism"". But the judge held that initiating ""action without delay"" cannot form a ground for dispensing with a departmental inquiry.","HC asked RPF to conduct proper disciplinary hearings within eight weeks given the fact that the constable had denied making the comments.

Farooq denies RAW ex-chief’s claim he supported Article 370 abrogation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/farooq-denies-raw-ex-chiefs-claim-he-supported-article-370-abrogation/articleshow/120356281.cms,"SRINAGAR: National Conference (NC) president Farooq Abdullah rejected Wednesday former RAW chief AS Dulat ’s claim that he privately supported the abrogation of Article 370, calling the assertion “misleading and inaccurate”.“His book has so many mistakes that I cannot describe them,” Abdullah told reporters. “He calls me a friend, but a friend cannot write such things.” He called the suggestion illogical, saying he and other politicians were detained the night Article 370 was revoked on August 5, 2019. “We were in jail. That very night, we were charged under Public Safety Act,” he said.Dulat’s claim appears in his forthcoming book “The Chief Minister and The Spy”, which has triggered a political storm in J&K. The former intelligence officer, who has written about his long friendship with Abdullah in earlier work, alleged that the NC chief supported the constitutional move in private, contradicting his party’s public position.NC has demanded the restoration of Article 370 and was the first to file a petition in the Supreme Court challenging its abrogation. Dulat’s revelation has placed the party on the defensive.Peoples Conference chairman Sajad Lone backed Dulat’s account, citing the former spymaster’s close ties with Abdullah. “He is virtually his alter ego,” Lone said. “I personally am not surprised. The August 2019 meeting of CM sahib and Farooq sahib with the PM was never a mystery for me.”Farooq Abdullah, his son CM Omar Abdullah, and NC MP Hasnain Masoodi had met PM Narendra Modi in New Delhi days before the abrogation.PDP politicians also weighed in. Iltija Mufti said the book confirmed long-held suspicions. “Dulat sahib, an ardent Abdullah supporter, has shared how Farooq sahib agreed with Delhi’s illegal move of abrogating Article 370,” she said. “There were doubts about what transpired between the Abdullahs and the PM days before J&K’s special status was revoked.”PDP’s Waheed Parra accused NC of political complicity. “While PDP faced the brunt of the state’s crackdown — with over 40 politicians jailed, dissent crushed, and journalists targeted — NC remained untouched,” he said. “There was no strong statement, no mass mobilisation. What followed instead was electoral opportunism.”NC spokesperson Tanvir Sadiq dismissed Dulat’s claim as a fabrication. “He writes many baseless things to make his book popular,” he said. “This is imagination, not fact.”Abdullah’s daughter Safia also rejected Dulat’s assertions. “I have never trusted Dulat. He was always a spy whose loyalty was only to himself,” she said. “He never cared who he threw under the bus with his books.”Dulat has earlier defended Abdullah in his books “Kashmir: The Vajpayee Years” and “A Life in the Shadows”, where he criticised Delhi for sidelining the veteran Kashmiri politician.","National Conference (NC) president Farooq Abdullah rejected former RAW chief AS Dulat ’s claim that he privately supported the abrogation of Article 370. “His book has so many mistakes that I cannot describe them,” Abdullah said.

A US citizen hijacked a domestic flight in Belize on Friday, stabbing two passengers and the pilot in a mid-air attack.One of the victims, who despite suffering critical injuries, managed to fatally shoot the attacker mid-flight, officials in Belize and the United States confirmed.The plane eventually landed safely, averting what authorities said could have been a mass casualty event.The Tropic Air flight, carrying 14 passengers and two crew members, had departed from Corozal, a small town near Belize’s northern border with Mexico, and was en route to the popular tourist destination of San Pedro when the hijacking occurred, reported NYT.The aircraft veered off course and flew erratically for nearly two hours before eventually landing in the coastal town of Ladyville, escorted by a police helicopter.Authorities said the full emergency was declared shortly after the incident began, around 8:30 am local time, according to a statement from the Belize Airport Concession Company.“In the face of incomprehensible pressure, our pilot acted with extraordinary courage and calm, guiding the aircraft to a safe landing. His actions were nothing short of heroic,” said Maximillian Greif, CEO of Tropic Air.The pilot and the two passengers who were stabbed were transported to a hospital. Their injuries were described as serious but survivable, with one of the passengers in critical condition.Belize Police Commissioner Chester Williams identified the hijacker as Akinyela Sawa Taylor, a US citizen whom he described as a military veteran. US officials said they could not confirm Taylor’s veteran status.According to Williams, Taylor demanded that the plane divert course, at times asking to be flown to Mexico, and at one point insisting the plane land to refuel. During the struggle, he stabbed the pilot and two passengers. One of the passengers, Fitzgerald Brown, managed to pull out a licensed firearm despite having been stabbed in the back and suffering a punctured lung. Brown shot and killed Taylor inside the aircraft. He later handed over the weapon to authorities.“We are praying for him,” Williams told reporters. “He’s our hero.”The other injured passenger was identified as Jair Castañeda, and the wounded pilot as Howell Grange, according to a Tropic Air official who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. The nationalities of Brown and Castañeda have not yet been released.At a press briefing in Washington, US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce described the hijacking as “horrifying” and praised the passengers and crew.“We are grateful, I think all of us are, that that did not turn into a mass casualty event with I believe over a dozen people on the plane,” Bruce said. “Clearly we know a few details. We don’t know much more.”Luke Martin, spokesperson for the US Embassy in Belize, confirmed that Taylor had demanded to be flown back to the United States during the ordeal. “We don’t know why he wanted to go back to the United States,” Martin said.Authorities in both countries said the motive for the hijacking remains unclear, and investigations are ongoing.","A US citizen hijacked a domestic flight in Belize on Friday, stabbing two passengers and the pilot in a mid-air attack.

“They decided he was guilty before he ever got a chance to speak.”

“Gross miscarriage of justice” : Lawyer’s words now echo louder after Kyren Lacy’s death



“This was a gross miscarriage of justice,”

“The evidence was clear — he didn’t do what they said he did. But the damage had already been done.”

Before there were charges, there were headlines. Before investigations could finish, there were tweets, threads, and YouTube breakdowns. Kyren Lacy , a young football player with a promising future, found himself at the center of a fatal December 2024 crash — and instantly, people had made up their minds.That’s the heartbreaking sentiment behind attorney Matt Ory ’s defense of former LSU wide receiver Kyren Lacy and the tragic reminder that once the internet picks a villain, it rarely waits for evidence.According to attorney Matt Ory, who has represented Lacy from the start, the narrative pushed online and in the press was far from the truth. “He didn’t cause this accident,” Ory stated firmly. The real story, according to the defense, was that another car crossed the centerline, colliding with the vehicle of the 78-year-old man who died in the crash.Lacy, Ory says, had briefly passed a line of vehicles and was already safely back in his lane when the accident happened not under the influence, not speeding recklessly, and not even involved in the collision’s physical impact.Lacy died by suicide on April 12 after fleeing from police earlier that morning. That single, tragic event flipped the spotlight back onto the case and Ory didn’t hold back.he told local media. He claims that if the legal process had been allowed to play out fully, Kyren would’ve been cleared.It wasn’t just the legal system he pointed fingers at, it was everyone. From the investigators to social media to the relentless online speculation, Ory believes Kyren was suffocating under the weight of a public verdict that came far too early.At 23, Lacy was preparing for the NFL Draft. Instead, he was trying to survive a legal firestorm, online criticism, and a world that had seemingly turned on him. And, according to Ory, there was no relief in sight even though the facts, he claims, were on Kyren’s side.No charges had been filed. Toxicology was clean. And yet, Lacy became the face of a crime he never committed, all while trying to prove his innocence silently. It’s a chilling reminder of how fast reputations are destroyed in the digital age — especially for young Black athletes .Also read - All eyes are on Taylor Swift to see if she’ll respond to Blake Lively’s TIME100 honor amid lawsuit drama","The case never went to trial but public opinion already convicted Kyren Lacy.

Who is Phoenix Ikner? Gunman accused in Florida state university campus shooting,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-phoenix-ikner-gunman-accused-in-florida-state-university-campus-shooting/articleshow/120395946.cms,"A shooting at Florida State University on Thursday left two people dead and at least six others injured after a 20-year-old student opened fire near the campus Student Union, authorities said. The shooter, identified as Phoenix Ikner , was wounded by police after refusing to comply with commands.FSU Police Chief Jason Trumbower confirmed that the two people who died were not university students. Ikner, the suspected gunman, is believed to be enrolled at FSU. Five other victims were being treated at Tallahassee Memorial Hospital, with one reported in critical condition. Ikner is also receiving medical attention.Authorities revealed that Ikner is the son of Leon County Sheriff’s Deputy Jessica Ikner and used one of her former service weapons in the attack. “Unfortunately, her son had access to one of her weapons, and that was one of the weapons that was found at the scene,” Sheriff Walter McNeil said, adding that the investigation would look into how he obtained it.McNeil also said Ikner had been a member of the sheriff’s Youth Advisory Council and had participated in multiple training programmes. “It’s not a surprise to us that he had access to weapons,” he said. A motive for the shooting has not yet been disclosed.The incident began around 11:50 a.m. when Ikner allegedly began shooting outside the Student Union. “Needless to say we have multiple crime scenes,” said Tallahassee Police Chief Lawrence Revell. “They challenged him and they ended up shooting him. He did not comply with commands and was shot. I do not believe he fired at all [toward police].”University officials cancelled all classes through Friday and advised students and staff to avoid the Student Union and surrounding areas, which remain active crime scenes. FSU's finals week is scheduled to begin on April 28, with commencement ceremonies slated for May 2–3.Eyewitnesses described moments of chaos. “I always hang out in the Student Union. So the second I found out that the threat was there, my heart sank and I was scared,” said student Andres Perez, who barricaded a classroom door with classmates before police escorted them to safety.Others echoed similar fears. “In that moment, it was survival,” said Ryan Cedergren, a communications student who hid in the bowling alley beneath the Union. Another student, Jake Nair, called the experience “surreal” after seeing officers escort students with their hands up.The FBI has opened a full investigation and is asking the public to submit any photos or videos from the scene. Florida A&M University, located nearby, also cancelled classes on Thursday.This is not the first time FSU has seen campus gun violence. In 2014, a gunman shot three people at the Strozier Library before being fatally shot by police.President Donald Trump responded to the incident from the Oval Office, saying, “It’s a shame,” but ruled out pushing for new gun legislation. “The gun doesn’t do the shooting, the people do,” he said, reaffirming his support for the Second Amendment. “I have an obligation to protect the Second Amendment.”","The shooter, identified as Phoenix Ikner, 20, was wounded by police after refusing to comply with commands.

Donald Trump weighs plan to deport violent US citizens to El Salvador prisons,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-weighs-plan-to-deport-violent-us-citizens-to-el-salvador-prisons/articleshow/120397708.cms,"The Donald Trump administration is exploring a proposal to detain and deport violent US citizens to prisons in El Salvador, sparking a fierce legal and constitutional debate in Washington and abroad.In a recent conversation with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele , Donald Trump floated the idea of sending “homegrown criminals” to El Salvador’s high-security CECOT mega-prison. “The homegrowns are next, the homegrowns. You've got to build about five more places,” Trump said, adding that the move would only be pursued “if legal.” He added, “We always have to obey the laws, but we also have homegrown criminals that push people into subways, that hit elderly ladies on the back of the head with a baseball bat when they're not looking, that are absolute monsters.”White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt clarified that only the most violent repeat offenders would be considered for the controversial proposal. “Trump would only consider this, if legal, for Americans who are the most violent, egregious, repeat offenders of crime who nobody in this room wants living in their communities,” she said.Legal experts have widely condemned the idea as unconstitutional. “Obviously unconstitutional, obviously illegal,” said David Bier of the libertarian Cato Institute, noting that US law does not authorise deportation of its own citizens. He warned the administration could bypass judicial checks: “The problem of course is [Trump] already has illegally deported hundreds of people by just not giving the courts an opportunity to stop him. I think that’s the real fear, now that he is going to try to evade judicial review of deportations of US citizens.”Harvard legal scholar Laurence Tribe described the proposal as an unprecedented threat to civil liberties. “What that means is that literally any of us… is vulnerable to basically being kidnapped by masked agents of the United States government… never to be seen again,” he told NPR.Despite the backlash, El Salvador's President Bukele has shown willingness to receive US prisoners. “Yeah, we’ve got space,” he said. Earlier this year, Bukele had floated the idea of housing convicted US citizens for a fee—an offer Trump and allies like Elon Musk publicly backed. “I’d do it in a heartbeat,” Trump said at the time.The policy debate has taken a personal turn with the controversial deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old Maryland resident removed from the US in March despite an active court order halting his removal. On Thursday, fresh images of Abrego Garcia emerged as Bukele posted photos of him with US Senator Chris Van Hollen, sipping margaritas in El Salvador.“Now that he’s been confirmed healthy, he gets the honor of staying in El Salvador’s custody,” Bukele posted on X. “Kilmar Abrego Garcia, miraculously risen from the ‘death camps’ & ‘torture’, now sipping margaritas with Sen. Van Hollen in the tropical paradise of El Salvador!🍹”Senator Van Hollen, who travelled to El Salvador this week, said he met Abrego Garcia on Thursday and phoned his wife to “pass along his message of love.” He had earlier been blocked from visiting the CECOT prison, where Abrego Garcia was believed to have been held. “They stopped us because they are under orders not to allow us to proceed,” Van Hollen said.The Trump administration has since admitted the deportation was a “mistake,” and the US Supreme Court has urged officials to facilitate Abrego Garcia’s return. But El Salvador’s Vice President Félix Ulloa reportedly told Van Hollen that their government has no intention of sending him back.","Donald Trump floated the idea of sending ""homegrown criminals"" to El Salvador’s high-security CECOT mega-prison.

MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred meets President Donald Trump

“President Trump is a longtime fan of baseball. As he has done in the past, Commissioner Manfred was pleased to visit the White House again to discuss issues pertaining to baseball with the President.”

“Over the next few weeks I will be signing a complete pardon of Pete Rose, who shouldn’t have been gambling on baseball, but only bet on his team winning.”

Rob Manfred made his stand clear on Pete Rose but now a change in opinion



“I believe that when you bet on baseball, from Major League Baseball’s perspective, you belong on the permanently ineligible list, When I dealt with the issue, the last time he applied for reinstatement, I made clear that I didn’t think that the function of that baseball list was the same as the eligibility criteria for the Hall of Fame. That remains my position. I think it’s a conversation that really belongs in the Hall of Fame board. I’m on that board, and it’s just not appropriate for me to get in front of that conversation.”

MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred and President Donald Trump had a meeting at the White House on Wednesday, where Manfred said he met him to discuss various issues concerning baseball.As per Washington Post, an MLB official confirmed the visit. MLB, had in a statement said:While it hasn’t been confirmed over what the meeting was about, the Commissioner’s visit comes after Donald Trump made statements over Pete Rose.In February, Trump had said that he was planning to issue a posthumous pardon to Pete Rose. Pete died in September. Back then, Trump had shared on Truth Social:It hasn’t been made clear as to why Trump would be pardoning Pete. The New York Post suggests that Pete had pleaded guilty to tax evasion and had even served five months in prison in 1990, Trump, however, hasn’t specifically mentioned this conviction when referring to a pardon.Rob Manfred had been considering a petition that would make Pete Rose eligible for the hall of fame on March 1. This was just less than 24 hours after US President Donald Trump made his stand very clear.However, this update could be seen as a change of what the decision was, since Manfred had no intentions of giving Pete Rose the Hall of Fame consideration.

The attack sparked a massive fireball, with NASA satellite data showing intense heat signatures at the site near Kamaran Island.According to the rebels, the strikes hit paramedics and civilian workers. “This completely unjustified aggression represents a flagrant violation of Yemen’s sovereignty and independence and a direct targeting of the entire Yemeni people,” the Houthis said via their SABA news agency. “It targets a vital civilian facility that has served the Yemeni people for decades.”The Ras Isa terminal, connected to Marib governorate by pipeline, is currently under Houthi control. While Yemen’s official oil exports have halted due to the prolonged war, the Houthis have continued to use the port to import oil.The attack comes days after Israeli strikes on Houthi-controlled oil infrastructure and follows a U.S. State Department warning issued on April 9 that said, “The United States will not tolerate any country or commercial entity providing support to foreign terrorist organizations, such as the Houthis, including offloading ships and provisioning oil at Houthi-controlled ports.”This latest strike is part of a wider US operation that began in mid-March. According to an AP review, the Trump administration’s campaign has intensified compared to that under President Joe Biden, expanding targets from launch sites to rebel leaders and urban infrastructure.The escalation follows Houthi threats to resume attacks on “Israeli” ships amid the Gaza blockade. Since November 2023, the rebels have targeted more than 100 commercial vessels, sinking two and killing four sailors. They have also launched unsuccessful assaults on US naval ships.Washington has tied the air campaign not only to Houthi maritime threats but also to broader efforts to counter Iran’s nuclear ambitions.","The US Central Command (CENTCOM) confirmed the strikes but did not acknowledge any casualties. “US forces took action to eliminate this source of fuel for the Iran-backed Houthi terrorists,” CENTCOM said in a statement.

Tough talk on Europe and China

Ukraine war exposes a rift

EU unity at risk?

US President Donald Trump and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni struck an unusually upbeat note on Friday as they met at the White House, signaling hope for a new US-EU trade deal and highlighting a growing ideological alignment between the two conservative leaders .“There will be a trade deal, 100 percent,” Trump declared confidently, seated beside Meloni during her charm offensive in Washington. The far-right Italian leader echoed the optimism: “I’m sure we can reach a deal.”Meloni, who became the first European leader to meet Trump since he imposed 20% tariffs on EU exports earlier this year, now suspended for 90 days, has pitched herself as a key intermediary between the US and Europe. “Even if we have some problems between the two shores of the Atlantic, it is the time that we try to sit down and find solutions,” she said.Throughout her visit, Meloni emphasized their shared worldview—from curbing immigration to battling “woke” ideology. “The goal for me is to make the West great again, and I think we can do it together,” she said, co-opting Trump’s signature slogan.Trump, who hosted her for a working lunch and Oval Office meeting, praised Meloni as “fantastic” and said she had extended an invitation to visit Rome soon—an offer he’s considering, potentially in conjunction with a broader EU leaders' meet.While the atmosphere was friendly, Trump returned to familiar criticisms. He accused the EU of trying to “screw” the US on trade and said the bloc needed to “get smart” on immigration and step up defense spending in Nato.“Everybody wants to make a deal and if they don't want to make a deal, we'll make the deal for them,” Trump warned, adding he was “in no rush.”He also claimed that China had “reached out” about resolving their trade war, despite his imposition of a steep 145% tariff following the April 2 “Liberation Day” tariffs. “I think we're going to make a very good deal with China,” he said.The Russia-Ukraine war remained a point of friction between the two. Meloni has been a firm supporter of Ukraine and recently called Russia’s Palm Sunday strike on Sumy “horrible and vile.” Trump, meanwhile, has shifted toward a more sympathetic stance on Moscow and has publicly attacked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.“I don't hold Zelensky responsible but I'm not exactly thrilled with the fact that that war started,” Trump said with Meloni beside him. “I'm not a big fan of the Ukrainian.”Meloni’s outreach has raised eyebrows in Brussels and across European capitals. While the European Commission stressed that the bloc alone can negotiate trade deals, it welcomed the Italian PM’s initiative as “coordinated with Brussels.”Still, some European leaders aren’t convinced. “If we start having bilateral discussions, obviously it will break the current dynamic,” warned France’s Industry Minister Marc Ferracci.According to Italian media, one aim of Meloni’s visit was to pave the way for a meeting between Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.After wrapping up her US trip, Meloni is expected back in Rome Friday to host US Vice President JD Vance. But her decision to personally engage Trump comes at a high-stakes moment. The tariffs he’s threatening could hit Italy hard—nearly 10% of its exports go to the US.Yet for now, both leaders are betting on their chemistry. As Meloni puts it, “I am aware of what I represent and I am aware of what I am defending.”",Giorgia Meloni is the first European leader to meet Trump since he imposed 20% tariffs on EU exports earlier this year.

Alps Are Freezing ! ❄️ Homes & Cars Buried Under Mountains of Snow | France, Switzerland, Italy

A powerful and rare spring snowstorm struck the Alps on Thursday, dumping over a metre of snow in just a few hours and causing widespread disruption across France, Italy, and Switzerland. Authorities in all three countries responded by closing roads, cancelling trains, and urging residents to stay indoors.At least one death has been reported. In Italy’s Piedmont region, firefighters found the body of a 92-year-old man inside his flooded home. In the French resort of Val Thorens, a woman went into cardiac arrest after being caught in an avalanche.In France, resorts such as Tignes and Val Thorens were temporarily closed due to high avalanche risk. In Tignes, more than 1.1 metres of snow fell overnight, prompting officials to order a lockdown. “All cars are covered up to the roof,” said Mathis, a hotel employee. “Just walking outside is worrying.”Similar scenes were reported in Sion, Switzerland, where all 36,000 residents were told to stay home. Roads in several regions were shut due to fallen trees and avalanche dangers. The Mont Blanc tunnel, a key route between France and Italy, was closed to heavy trucks, causing traffic jams and leaving dozens of lorries stuck on the A43 highway.Trains were also cancelled, and around 3,300 homes in France’s Savoy region lost power. In Milan, parks were shut due to flooding and strong winds.While snow in April is not unusual, the volume and intensity of this storm took many by surprise. Retired ski instructor Yann Geaudry told news agency AFP that once the sun returns, melting snow could quickly trigger flooding in lower areas.","A powerful and rare spring snowstorm struck the Alps on Thursday, dumping over a metre of snow in just a few hours.

‘A disgrace’: Donald Trump hits out at Harvard University

US President Donald Trump intensified his administration’s ongoing clash with Harvard University on Thursday, labeling the Ivy League institution “a disgrace” as federal agencies take unprecedented steps against its funding, tax status, and ability to host international students.Speaking to reporters outside the White House, Trump delivered a scathing rebuke of the university, citing what he called its failure to uphold American values. “I think Harvard’s a disgrace,” Trump said calling them ""obviously antisemitic"".Further talking about the reports that the Internal Revenue Service was planning to remove Harvard's tax-exempt status, Trump addressing the press at the White House claimed to not know the status of their findings. He did not think a final ruling had been made, and indicated other schools were under scrutiny. ""I'm not involved in it. It's being handled by lawyers. I read about it just like you did,"" he said about the reports. However, talk about the exemption he said, ""Tax-exempt status, I mean, it's a privilege. It's really a privilege, and it's been abused by a lot more than Harvard.""Then naming other universities he went on to say, ""When you take a look whether it's Columbia, Harvard, Princeton, I don't know what's going on, but when you see how badly they've acted and in other ways also. So we'll, we'll be looking at it very strongly.""The scriticism came after the Department of Homeland Security formally ordered Harvard to provide detailed records on foreign students allegedly involved in “illegal and violent activities.” In a separate action, the administration canceled two federal grants worth $2.7 million and froze over $2 billion in additional funding for research and academic programs.Read full story: Donald Trump administration asks Internal Revenue Service to strip Harvard of tax-exempt status over campus antisemitism Harvard, the oldest and wealthiest university in the United States, became a primary target after refusing to comply with federal demands to discipline student activists, revise admissions policies, and monitor international students for ideological alignment with “American values.”In an open challenge to the government, Harvard President Alan Garber declared Monday that the university would not submit to politically driven demands, citing constitutional protections. “Harvard will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights,” the university said in a statement.Earlier, Trump has also questioned whether Harvard should retain its tax-exempt status as a nonprofit, writing on Truth Social that the university’s actions may violate laws governing charitable institutions. While federal law bars the president from directly initiating an IRS investigation, officials confirmed that a review into Harvard’s tax standing was underway before his remarks.Former Harvard President and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers condemned the effort, calling it “an abuse of executive power,"" as quoted by Reuters.The administration’s aggressive stance has sparked alarm across academia, especially among international students. At Harvard, where 27% of students come from abroad, many expressed fear that their legal status is in jeopardy.“Harvard without its international community is simply not Harvard,” said Leo Gerdén, a Swedish senior studying economics and government. “We feel like targets, and it’s terrifying.”With tensions escalating and institutions like Columbia University following Harvard’s lead in defying government pressure, the standoff appears far from over. “This is not just about Harvard,” said democracy professor Archon Fung. “It’s about whether academic institutions can remain independent in the face of political coercion.”","US President Donald Trump intensified his administration’s ongoing clash with Harvard University on Thursday.

Watch: Italian reporter asks Donald Trump if he called Europeans 'parasites'; Giorgia Meloni reacts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-italian-reporter-asks-donald-trump-if-he-called-europeans-parasites-giorgia-meloni-reacts/articleshow/120396477.cms,"AP photo

During a joint press conference at the White House between Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni and US president Donald Trump, an Italian journalist asked Trump if he had ever called Europeans ""parasites.""The question was asked in Italian, after the journalist requested to switch languages. Meloni quickly stepped in and responded, ""No, he never said that.""She then turned to Trump and asked him, “Have you ever said Europeans are parasites? Have you said that?” Trump denied the claim, saying, “I have never said that. I don’t even know what you’re talking about.”A March 2025 article in The Atlantic cited leaked Signal messages from Trump administration officials that described Europeans as parasites in the context of discussions around airstrikes in Yemen.The awkward exchange at the press meet did not derail the leaders’ meeting, focused on trade and diplomacy. Trump, who recently imposed 20 percent tariffs on EU exports, said a deal with the European Union was “100 percent” possible. Meloni echoed that confidence and said she was sure they could find common ground. She invited Trump to visit Rome and possibly meet other EU leaders.Meloni’s visit marked her as the first European leader to meet Trump since his tariff announcement. She used the opportunity to underline their shared stances on immigration, defence spending, and cultural issues. “The goal for me is to make the West great again,” she said, mirroring Trump’s MAGA slogan.""Even if we have some problems between the two shores of the Atlantic, it is time that we try to sit down and find solutions,"" she said.But even as Trump sounded confident about reaching a deal with the 27-nation European Union, which he has accused of trying to “take advantage” of the United States, he said he was in “no rush.” “Everybody wants to make a deal — and if they don’t, we’ll go ahead and make the deal for them,” he added.Some EU members expressed concern about Meloni’s direct engagement with Trump, fearing it could undermine EU unity. France’s industry minister warned that individual deals might “break the current dynamic,” reported Associated Press.Meloni returns to Rome on Friday and is set to host US vice president JD Vance. Trump’s tariff threats remain a key issue, especially for Italy, which sends around 10 percent of its exports to the US.","Italian journalist asked Trump if he had ever called Europeans ""parasites"" Trump denied the claim, saying, ""I have never said that.

Officers responded to reports of gunfire and found Patel lying on the sidewalk with a gunshot wound to the chest. He was rushed to Illinois Masonic Medical Center, where he later died. The Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office later confirmed his identity.Garrett Moores, a neighbour who rushed to Patel's side, described the desperate attempt to save his life. “I grabbed towels and ran down,” he said. Guided by a 911 operator, Moores and another neighbour tried chest compressions and worked to keep Patel conscious. “You almost build a personal connection in those moments. It was devastating,” Moores added, reported ABC 7 Chicago.The incident happened just yards away from 43rd Ward Alderman Timmy Knudsen’s office. He addressed the violence in a statement, calling it a reminder of the ongoing fight against citywide crime. He said he has asked for increased patrols and more support from City Hall, especially with summer approaching.Witnesses reported seeing a man and a woman running from the area shortly before police arrived. No arrests have been made, and Area Three detectives are continuing the investigation.","Kevin Patel, a 28-year-old man, was shot and killed in Chicago’s Lincoln Park neighbourhood on Wednesday night.

Donald Trump Comments On Zelenskyy: 'Don't hold him responsible but I'm not exactly thrilled': Trump shifts tone on Zelenskyy on Russia-Ukraine war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/dont-hold-him-responsible-but-im-not-exactly-thrilled-trump-shifts-tone-on-zelenskyy-on-russia-ukraine-war/articleshow/120397977.cms,"'Don't hold him responsible but I'm not exactly thrilled': Trump shifts tone on Zelenskyy on Russia-Ukraine war (Picture credit: AP)

US President Donald Trump on Thursday softened his tone for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and said he does not blame him for the Russian invasion. However, he continued to criticise his leadership regarding the handling of the war.""I don't hold Zelenskyy responsible but I'm not exactly thrilled with the fact that that war started,"" Trump told reporters at the White House during a joint press conference with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. ""I'm not blaming him, but what I am saying is that I wouldn't say he's done the greatest job, OK? I am not a big fan.""This comes days after Trump accused Ukraine of starting the war and blamed Zelenskyy for “millions” of deaths. The Ukrainian leader had earlier this week invited Trump to visit Ukraine to witness the destruction firsthand, during an interview with CBS. In response, Trump issued threats against the broadcaster.Meanwhile, Trump said a long-delayed minerals agreement with Ukraine was likely to be signed next Thursday. “We have a minerals deal which I guess is going to be signed on Thursday... next Thursday. Soon. And I assume they're going to live up to the deal. So we'll see,” he said.Kyiv and Washington had previously been close to finalising the agreement, but a heated clash in February between Trump, Zelenskyy and US Vice President JD Vance at the White House had stalled progress.Ukraine’s economy minister Yulia Svyrydenko confirmed on X that a “Memorandum of Intent” had been signed with Washington for an “Investment Fund for the Reconstruction of Ukraine.”While she offered no details, Svyrydenko said the memorandum marked significant progress.“There is a lot to do, but the current pace and significant progress give reason to expect that the document will be very beneficial for both countries,” she wrote.According to The New York Times, the memorandum, signed via video call with US treasury secretary Scott Bessent, fell short of a full minerals agreement. Bessent said a final deal was expected by April 26 and noted the deal could allow the US to earn up to $500 billion through access to Ukraine’s rare earth resources.Trump has framed the agreement as repayment for military assistance sent by the Biden administration.Earlier drafts of the deal reportedly included plans to redirect a portion of Ukraine’s resource revenues to fund postwar reconstruction, a clause critics have described as exploitative. The document signed on Thursday omitted such specifics, as well as references to US security guarantees.","US President Donald Trump says he does not blame Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for the Russia-Ukraine war.

'Now sipping margaritas with senator': Fresh images of deported US resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia amid legal row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/now-sipping-margaritas-with-senator-fresh-images-of-deported-us-resident-kilmar-abrego-garcia-amid-legal-row/articleshow/120397168.cms,"Fresh images of deported Maryland resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia emerged Thursday after El Salvador President Nayib Bukele posted photos of him sipping margaritas with US Senator Chris Van Hollen , sparking a new wave of controversy around the 29-year-old’s detention.Bukele in a post on X said, “Now that he’s been confirmed healthy, he gets the honor of staying in El Salvador’s custody. Kilmar Abrego Garcia, miraculously risen from the ‘death camps’ & ‘torture’, now sipping margaritas with Sen. Van Hollen in the tropical paradise of El Salvador!🍹”The meeting comes months after Abrego Garcia was deported in March by the Trump administration despite an active immigration court order blocking his removal. His lawyers have since been fighting for his return to the United States, accusing the administration of violating due process and international law.Sen. Van Hollen, who travelled to El Salvador this week to push for Abrego Garcia’s release, said he met the detainee on Thursday and called his wife to “pass along his message of love.” Earlier that day, Van Hollen said he was denied access to the high-security CECOT prison, where he believes Abrego Garcia had been held.“They stopped us because they are under orders not to allow us to proceed,” the senator said, describing how soldiers turned his vehicle away just kilometres from the facility.The Trump administration acknowledged the deportation as a “mistake” and the US Supreme Court has urged officials to facilitate Abrego Garcia’s return. However, El Salvador’s Vice President Félix Ulloa reportedly told Van Hollen that their government has no intention of sending him back.Meanwhile, human rights groups have accused President Bukele’s administration of mistreating detainees in the country’s sprawling gang prison system. Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national and former Maryland resident, has not been charged with any crime in the US , though Trump officials have claimed he has ties to the MS-13 gang — allegations his lawyers say remain unsubstantiated.“This is about due process and the rule of law,” Van Hollen said. “We won’t give up until Kilmar has his due process rights respected.”The senator’s visit has deepened partisan tensions back home. While Democrats argue the deportation exemplifies the Trump administration’s disregard for court orders, Republicans have rallied around the crackdown. GOP lawmakers, including Rep. Riley Moore of West Virginia and Rep. Jason Smith of Missouri, have toured the CECOT prison in support of Trump's immigration policy. Moore wrote on social media that the facility “houses the country’s most brutal criminals,” while Smith praised Trump for its expansion to include “illegal immigrants who broke into our country and committed violent acts against Americans.”More Democratic lawmakers, including Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, are reportedly planning similar visits. Since March, El Salvador has received over 200 deportees from the US , many accused of gang affiliations, and detained them in the controversial maximum-security prison outside San Salvador.Court documents show the US government has repeatedly declined to disclose its plans for Abrego Garcia’s repatriation, further fuelling legal battles and international scrutiny over the case.","El Salvador President Nayib Bukele posted photos of Kilmar Abrego Garcia sipping margaritas with US Senator Chris Van Hollen.

Trump: ‘The gun doesn’t do the shooting, the people do’

United States' president Donald Trump responded on Thursday to the shooting at Florida State University that left two people dead and six others injured, calling it “terrible” and a “shame.” However, he stood firm on his long-held position against tightening gun laws .Speaking to reporters, Trump said, “These things are terrible. But the gun doesn’t do the shooting, the people do.”When asked whether stricter gun laws would be considered in light of the attack, Trump said he remained committed to protecting the second amendment. The second amendment to the United States constitution protects the right to keep and bear arms.“As far as legislation is concerned, this has been going on for a long time,” he said. “I have an obligation to protect the second amendment. I ran on the second amendment… and I will always protect the second amendment,” said Trump.The shooting, which took place on the Florida State University campus in Tallahassee on Thursday, left two dead and six injured.

Baloch separatists kill 8 Pakistanis in Iran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/baloch-separatists-kill-8-pakistanis-in-iran/articleshow/120262403.cms,"ISLAMABAD:

Eight Pakistani car mechanics were shot dead in Iran late Saturday, sparking outrage and deepening fears that the country was becoming a hub for anti-Pakistan militants after Afghanistan.Balochistan National Army (BNA), a lesser-known separatist group, claimed responsibility for the attack in Sistan-Baluchestan province, escalating tensions between the neighbouring countries as Pakistan demanded swift action. The eight workers hailed from Punjab -- Pakistan’s most populous province -- and were killed at a workshop in Mehrestan district, near Afghanistan’s border, Pakistani authorities said.BNA framed the killings as retaliation against perceived Punjabi dominance in Balochistan’s economic and political spheres. “We will not allow outsiders to exploit our land and resources,” BNA said in an online statement, echoing long-standing Baloch grievances over resource exploitation and marginalisation. The outfit has aligned itself with the broader Baloch insurgency led by groups like Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA).Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif called the attack “barbaric”. “We demand the perpetrators be brought to justice swiftly,” he said, urging Tehran to act. Sharif ordered the foreign ministry to help the victims’ families and repatriate the bodies. Foreign minister Ishaq Dar issued a similar condemnation. “This attack challenges our sovereignty. We cannot allow our citizens to be targeted abroad,” Dar said.Iran’s response was measured but conspicuously vague. Ambassador Reza Amiri Moghadam condemned the killings as “inhumane and cowardly”, calling terrorism a “chronic plight” that demands regional cooperation. Yet, Tehran offered no concrete assurances of cracking down on groups like BNA, prompting scepticism in Islamabad.Thousands of Pakistanis, particularly from economically deprived areas, travel to Iran on a regular basis to take up informal jobs in sectors such as vehicle repairs, construction, and agriculture.In Jan 2024, nine Pakistani labourers were killed and three critically injured in a similar attack in Saravancity, also located in Iran’s southeastern border region. Like in the latest killings, the victims in that case worked in an automobile repair shop. These murders occurred at a time when Pakistan and Iran were attempting to repair diplomatic relations after tit-for-tat missile and drone attacks.","Balochistan National Army (BNA), a lesser-known separatist group, claimed responsibility for the attack.

The resolution also demanded an immediate halt to any plans or work related to the project until an agreement with all provincial governments, especially Sindh, was reached to ensure that the province's rights were fully protected and respected.While addressing a PPP rally in Garhi Khuda Bakhsh on the anniversary of Pakistan's former Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's execution, Bhutto said that the PPP had always fought for peoples' rights to water, Dawn reported.He said, ""The workers of the PPP have grown old fighting for the fair distribution of water."" Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said, ""Be it Musharraf's unilateral canal proposal, or that of the PTI founder, there is no forum where we have not taken up our struggle."" He stated that the IRSA report shows there are water shortages in Punjab also, Dawn reported.He said, ""If we take water from here (Sindh), it'll harm farmers in South Punjab. These are reservations we have had for a very long time."" He stated that he was the first to raise his voice against the canal project.","Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has been re-elected as Chairman of the Pakistan People's Party.

Poll Do you believe that Pakistan is adequately prepared for earthquakes? No Yes

A moderate-intensity earthquake with a magnitude of 5.8 struck Pakistan at around 1 pm on Saturday, with tremors felt in Jammu and Kashmir.Tremors were felt across many parts of the Valley, but there were no immediate reports of casualties or property damage. The earthquake occurred at a depth of 10 kilometres, with coordinates of 33.63 degrees North latitude and 72.46 degrees East longitude.According to the National Center for Seismology (NCS), the recent earthquake struck at a shallow depth of 10km, increasing the likelihood of aftershocks.Shallow earthquakes are typically more dangerous than deeper ones because the seismic waves travel a shorter distance to the surface, causing stronger ground shaking and potentially more damage to structures and higher casualties.Pakistan, located on the boundary of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates, is one of the most seismically active countries. The nation frequently experiences destructive earthquakes due to its position on major fault lines. Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, and Gilgit-Baltistan lie on the southern edge of the Eurasian plate, while Sindh, Punjab, and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir are on the north-western edge of the Indian plate. The collision of these plates makes the region highly susceptible to violent earthquakes.Earlier, Pakistan’s neighbor Tajikistan was also jolted by a 4.2 magnitude earthquake.","A moderate-intensity earthquake with a magnitude of 5.8 struck Pakistan at around 1 pm on Saturday, with tremors felt in Jammu and Kashmir.

Poll Should the Pakistani military have a role in politics? No, it undermines democracy. Yes, they provide stability.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s political landscape remains a battleground of competing forces, with the military, former prime minister Imran Khan, and the current govt under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif locked in a tense struggle.The interplay of US foreign policy and the Pakistani diaspora’s growing voice adds further complexity to a nation grappling with economic woes, security threats and democratic erosion.Imran Khan, ousted in April 2022 via a no-confidence vote, continues to challenge the status quo from behind bars. Convicted on corruption and state secret charges, the cricketer-turned-politician retains a fervent base, accusing the military and Sharif’s govt of colluding with the US to orchestrate his downfall.Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) alleges widespread rigging in the Feb 2024 elections, which saw Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) secure power through a fragile coalition. PTI supporters, galvanised by Khan’s claims, have staged protests, clashing with the security forces and deepening the political divide.The military, longtime kingmaker in Pakistani politics, appears to have shifted allegiance. Once Khan’s backer in his 2018 rise, the army soured on him after policy disputes and his public criticisms of General Asim Munir, the current army chief.Analysts suggest the military now props up Sharif’s govt, a dynamic evident in legislative moves like the 2023 Pakistan Army Act amendment, which stifled dissent and empowered the armed forces. This hybrid regime – blending electoral democracy with military influence – has drawn scrutiny for undermining constitutional norms, yet the generals show no sign of relinquishing their grip.However, Shehbaz Sharif, re-elected in March 2024 as PM, faces a legitimacy crisis. His coalition, including the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) and other smaller factions, struggles to address surging militant attacks, crumbling infrastructure, and an economy reliant on IMF bailouts.Sharif vows to mend ties with Washington but his govt’s dependence on military support raises questions about its autonomy. Khan’s call for an election audit, echoed in a letter to the IMF, threatens to derail these efforts as Pakistan awaits a critical loan installment.The US role remains contentious. Khan’s unproven claims of a Washington-led conspiracy resonate with a populace wary of foreign interference, a sentiment rooted in decades of strained relations. The Biden administration, while engaging Sharif’s govt, has maintained robust military ties with Pakistan, prioritising counter-terrorism over democratic concerns. This ambivalence has fuelled Khan’s narrative, even as US officials dismiss his allegations.Meanwhile, the Pakistani diaspora, particularly in the US, has emerged as a vocal force. Pro-democracy activists, many aligned with PTI, have lobbied Congress, securing bipartisan support for resolutions condemning elections irregularities and Khan’s detention. Over 100 lawmakers have urged his release, while some advocate sanctions against military leaders like Munir. This diaspora-driven pressure marks a shift, challenging the traditional US-Pakistan security nexus.As Pakistan teeters between chaos and stability, the military’s shadow looms large, Khan’s defiance endures, and Sharif’s govt navigates a treacherous path. With the US and Pakistani diaspora adding external weight, the nation’s democratic future hangs in the balance.","Imran Khan, ousted in April 2022 via a no-confidence vote, continues to challenge the status quo from behind bars.
