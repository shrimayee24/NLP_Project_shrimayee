NEW DELHI: India on Friday voted in favour of a United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) resolution permitting Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to deliver a virtual address next week after the United States cancelled his visa after the Trump administration cancelled his visa.The UN General Assembly concluded its session with a positive signal for the Palestinian President as it received overwhelming majority, with 145 countries supporting it, while five nations, including Israel and the US, opposed, and six abstained from the vote. The other countries opposing were Palau, Paraguay and Nauru, ANI reported.Earlier, the US blocked Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas from attending the UN General Assembly session in New York next month after he and 80 other Palestinian officials had their visas revoked, the State Department has said.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio blamed them for undermining peace efforts and for seeking ""the unilateral recognition of a conjectural Palestinian state"".The ban comes as France leads international efforts to recognise a state of Palestine at the session—a move Donald Trump's administration has opposed. The Palestinian ambassador to the UN, Riyad Mansour, had earlier said that, as head of its delegation, Abbas would be attending the meeting of heads of state and government.But a State Department official later said Abbas and about 80 other Palestinians would be affected by the decision to deny and revoke visas from members of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the Palestinian Authority (PA).

'Could have stayed silent': Ian Bremmer praises PM Modi for 'defying' Trump; how it had positive impact,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/could-have-stayed-silent-ian-bremmer-praises-pm-modi-defying-trump-how-it-had-positive-impact/articleshow/123997468.cms,"India’s oil purchase from Russia



US-Pakistan ties



From dead economy to great country



American political scientist and Eurasia Group president Ian Bremmer praised PM Modi for publicly rejecting US President Donald Trump’s claim of mediating between India and Pakistan during the escalation in May following Operation Sindoor.Bremmer described the move as a rare show of resistance against Washington that stood out on the global stage, claiming that other countries would have “sucked it up and not said anything”.In an interview with ANI, Bremmer said PM Modi’s decision to openly contradict Trump was an example of personality-driven diplomacy.“There have been no consequences to the Russians for telling Trump no. And I think Modi is in that space, right? Because Modi could have easily not embarrassed Trump about the India Pakistan issue and instead Modi decided to publicly say no you had nothing to do with this and really did embarrass Trump on the global stage.”“Modi decided personally that he was going to make this public, he was going to embarrass the US president even though the US president is much more powerful than Modi is. And you know most other leaders in that position have chosen to remain silent,” he said.To stress his point, Bremmer cited UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s example who chose to be more accommodating towards Trump, even if he didn’t agree with him in private..“Some of them have even proactively talked about how amazing Trump is, how wonderful Trump is. I mean, look at Kier Starmer, who certainly doesn't like what Trump stands for, but loves the fact that he got a better deal from Trump than other countries have. He's in a very weak position,” Bremmer explained.In early August, Trump raised tariffs on India by 25% for continuing to buy Russian oil, saying the trade was helping Moscow’s war effort. This pushed the total tariff on Indian goods entering the US to 50%.Bremmer said that PM Modi’s close ties with Russia gave a direct message to the US president.“He got into Putin 's limousine just like Putin got into Trump's limousine and made it very clear as Trump was saying, ‘I'm going to increase tariffs on you because you're buying all this oil.’ Modi saying, ‘I'm going to do whatever I want with Putin and I'm not going to listen to you.’ That was a very direct message,” Bremmer said.Pointing to what he called hypocrisy over US pressure on India to stop buying Russian oil, the political scientist said, “I wouldn't talk about oil, I would talk about the Americans buying Russian uranium, billions of Russian uranium and fertilizer. So at the same time the Americans are telling you don't buy oil, the Americans are buying Russian product and and they're not suggesting that they're going to stop.”He added that India’s refusal to accept Trump’s claims had not harmed bilateral relations. “I think that was, it was noticed but it did not lead to negative consequences. In fact, it probably made Trump pay more attention to the need to engage with Modi in a friendlier way. I would say that worked.”On the broader India-US relationship, Bremmer was cautious. “I don't think the relationship is fundamentally broken. But the idea that the US is going to become India's reliable trusted great power partner is clearly not in the cards,” he said.Bremmer also warned of India’s declining trust in the United States as it inclines towards Pakistan.“I think there's less trust. I think that there is a sense in India that the US is less reliable than it used to be. Part of that is the Pakistan relationship with the United States both officially as well as unofficially and the business connections. Part of it is Trump's recklessness in diplomacy, his desire for credit and his indifference to how that may affect others that he's working with.”When asked if this was about trade or personality politics, Bremmer linked it also to Washington’s ties with Islamabad. “Well, I think it's about Pakistan too, right? I mean, the US suddenly is working more closely with Pakistan,” he said.He also criticised the Trump administration’s approach, suggesting it was driven largely by economic and business interests. “This is mostly about business...There is a kind a of lack of ethics, a kleptocratic and oligarchic impulse with the family, and a constellation of people that are around the administration, trusted by light, who are conducting a lot of business with Pakistan. And that has brought them in. I don't think it's a particular strategic shift. I think it's opportunistic, and it's about some money,” he said.Bremmer further noted that US support in Europe had already weakened. “If the Americans aren't even interested in a strong Europe, it's hard to imagine they're going to be very interested in a strong India,” he observed.Turning to regional developments, he linked the Saudi-Pakistan mutual defence pact to growing frustrations with Washington’s handling of Israel’s actions in Gaza.Talking about Trump’s changing remarks about India’s economy, Bremmer was dismissive.“Trump changes what he says about you on a dime depending on, you know, sort of how he feels in the moment. It has nothing to do with with the Indian economy.”Earlier on July 31, the US President wrote on his social media platform, “I don’t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care.”However, days later on September 10, he changed his stance, “I am pleased to announce that India, and the United States of America, are continuing negotiations to address the Trade Barriers between our two Nations. I look forward to speaking with my very good friend, Prime Minister Modi, in the upcoming weeks. I feel certain that there will be no difficulty in coming to a successful conclusion for both of our Great Countries!”",Bremmer praised PM Modi for publicly rejecting US President Donald Trump’s claim of mediating between India and Pakistan during the escalation in May.

'Manmohan Singh Thanked Me For Meeting Hafiz Saeed': Yasin Malik's Bombshell Claim; BJP Slams Cong

SRINAGAR: Former J&K CM and PDP president Mehbooba Mufti wrote to home minister Amit Shah on Friday, taking up cudgels on behalf of jailed separatist Yasin Malik and seeking ""a compassionate and urgent review"" of the terror funding case against him on grounds of what she described as ""his long-standing commitment to non-violence"".""Over the years, Malik engaged in dialogue involving senior officials, intelligence personnel, and even controversial figures like Hafiz Saeed, all with the tacit consent of Indian agencies. These efforts represented a painstaking and deliberate attempt to build bridges in a deeply fractured land,"" Mehbooba said, referring to Malik's recent affidavit in Delhi high court.The PDP president, whose many controversies include her claim that J&K accepted the Indian tricolour in 1947 on certain conditions and constitutional guarantees, said she was writing to Shah ""not merely as a witness but as someone who has lived through the turbulent times of Kashmir, bearing its grief, enduring its silences, and holding on to its fragile hopes"".She claimed Malik's journey was no secret. ""In 1994, he took a courageous and rare decision to lay down arms and embrace political, non-violent means to pursue change. According to his sworn affidavits, this shift was neither unilateral nor impulsive but encouraged and facilitated through back-channel understandings with Indian agencies,"" the letter states.In his affidavit, Malik spoke of his involvement in backchannel diplomacy, including private meetings with PMs, ministers and intelligence chiefs.He was convicted and sentenced to life in prison by an NIA court on charges of receiving foreign funding and collaborating with terrorist groups. NIA has since appealed to Delhi HC to turn his life term into death penalty.""This appeal does not seek to undermine the judiciary's authority but calls for the responsible exercise of democratic instruments to honour both justice and mercy. The spirit of India, I firmly believe, lies in our capacity to show magnanimity and uphold promises made in pursuit of peace,"" Mehbooba's letter pleads.Peoples Conference chief and MLA Sajad Lone accused the ex-CM of ""hypocrisy"". He said seeking clemency for Malik, chairperson of the banned Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front, amounted to ""mere theatrics"".","Mehbooba Mufti writes to home minister Amit Shah seeking clemency for Yasin Malik.

NEW DELHI: Moving fast on PM Narendra Modi’s Independence Day announcement, the Union cabinet has approved setting up of a High Level Committee (HLC) which will study and suggest measures to deal with the demographic changes arising from illegal immigration. It will also study “other abnormal causes” behind the issue what Modi has called a security challenge.TOI has learnt that the proposal got the go ahead in the last cabinet meeting held on Sept 10. Sources said home minister Amit Shah had briefed his cabinet colleagues about the setting up of the HLC in the light of illegal immigration, particularly in border areas. The details of composition of the panel and the timeline for giving the recommendations are not yet known.They added that soon there would be a detailed notification about the HLC, including the terms of reference of the panel which may also have some representation from bordering states.In his last Independence Day speech, the PM had announced the launch of a High-Power Demography Mission to address the “severe crisis” of a “deliberate conspiracy” to alter the country's demography. Terming illegal immigration as seeds of a new crisis being sown, Modi had said infiltrators are snatching away the livelihoods of the youth.“These infiltrators are targeting our sisters and daughters. This will not be tolerated. These infiltrators are misleading innocent tribals and seizing their lands. The nation will not endure this. When demographic change occurs, particularly in border areas, it creates a crisis for national security. It threatens the unity, integrity, and progress of the country. It sows the seeds of social tension. No country can hand itself over to infiltrators. No nation in the world does so—how then can we allow Bharat to do so?” Modi had said.Both the PM and home minister have highlighted the issue of illegal immigration in their recent addresses at rallies in Assam and Bihar. Last week, Modi, in his address in Assam, had blamed Congress for the ongoing demographic challenges while branding the main opposition party as “defenders of infiltrators and anti-national forces”. The PM had said, “Any change to demography is a danger to national security. BJP’s objective is to protect the country from infiltrators and restore its integrity. ..We will show the way we dedicate our lives to remove infiltrators.”Last month, Shah had urged district magistrates of border districts to take action to remove illegal encroachments within 30 km from the borders while stating that demographic changes in border areas directly impact country’s security and they could be part of a “deliberate design”.",The High Level Committee (HLC) will study and suggest measures to deal with the demographic changes arising from illegal immigration.

"Donald Trump to levy $100,000 H-1B visa application fee; overhaul aimed at protecting American workers: Report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/donald-trump-to-levy-100000-h-1b-visa-application-fee-overhaul-aimed-at-protecting-american-workers-report/articleshow/124004906.cms,"Donald Trump (File photo)





The US administration plans a major change to the H-1B visa programme, with President Donald Trump expected to sign a proclamation Friday imposing a $100,000 application fee, according to a White House official, quoted in a Bloomberg report.The order is intended to curb misuse of the visa category and its perceived impact on American jobs. Entry under the programme would require the hefty payment, the official said (anonymously), while the Labour Secretary will be directed to begin revising H-1B wage rules to protect US workers from wage suppression.The technology sector, a heavy user of H-1B visas, is likely to feel the sharpest effects. The White House argues the new measures will bolster the integrity of the system and reduce exploitation. A document reviewed by Bloomberg News describes the replacement of American workers with lower-cost foreign labour as a national-security issue that discourages domestic STEM careers.It remains unclear whether the $100,000 fee will be added to or replace existing charges. Current costs include a $215 lottery registration and a $780 Form I-129 filing.The programme grants 85,000 visas annually through a lottery that some firms allegedly game by submitting multiple applications, often to hire lower-paid staff via staffing and outsourcing companies.This move aligns with broader immigration fee hikes for work permits, asylum requests and other services, intended to fund detention facilities, expanded border barriers and additional enforcement personnel.","Technology sector, a heavy user of H-1B visas, is likely to feel the sharpest effects.

MUMBAI: Rahul Mukerjea was offered advice and assistance to lodge a missing person's report when he said his girlfriend, Sheena Bora, disappeared in 2012, but ""he never took"" the help offered by a lawyer.Bora's childhood friend, a 38-year-old homemaker from Guwahati, said this during a cross-examination in the Sheena Bora murder case , while deposing as a prosecution witness before a trial court on Friday.The witness also admitted that although the lawyer, her cousin practising at the Supreme Court, offered Rahul help to file a Habeas Corpus petition before the HC, he never filed it. The cross-examination was conducted by defence counsel Ranjeet Sangle, representing the prime accused, Indrani Mukerjea , who the prosecuting agency said is Sheena's biological mother.""It is correct to say that my cousin offered help to Rahul, but he never took it,"" the witness said in response to a question from Sangle.Indrani and her two former husbands, Sanjeev Khanna and Peter Mukerjea-all three present in court and on bail-are facing the murder trial.The prosecuting agency, CBI, claims that on April 24, 2012, Sheena's biological mother, Indrani, and Khanna strangled Sheena in a car driven by Indrani's driver, Shyamwar Rai, the original accused-turned-approver.The car allegedly picked Sheena up from a shopping mall in Bandra.Indrani's counsel, Sangle, in his cross-examination of the witness, posed questions to poke holes in her testimony as a prosecution witness and to establish Indrani's denial of any role in the alleged murder.To a question from Sangle, the witness, dressed in a pink salwar kameez and answering all questions quietly after contemplation, also said Rahul-son of Peter from his previous marriage-never told her that when he dropped Sheena in Bandra to go shopping with Indrani, he saw anyone outside the store.She said that, until Oct 2009, Sheena informed her that she merely shared a flat with Rahul but did not disclose that she had been in a romantic relationship with him since 2008.The prosecution witness had earlier deposed that Indrani was against the Sheena-Rahul relationship, and the prosecution's case also hinged on the alleged objection as one of the motives for the crime.To another question, the witness admitted that she had, in an email, asked Sheena if Rahul ""was clean."" Sangle asked what she meant by 'clean.' To further prodding by the lawyer, her testimony said, ""By this email, I mean whether Rahul was a genuine person, taking care of her, whether he was addicted to any vices ...""","Sheena Bora's childhood friend, a 38-year-old homemaker from Guwahati, said this during a cross-examination.

BHOPAL: A woman in her full-term pregnancy delivered in the washroom of the Community Health Center after her water broke, and the infant fell to the floor, dying on the spot from a skull injury. The incident took place in Chourai village of Chhindwara district on Sept 11, with the family accusing hospital staff of failing to provide timely care.The victim, Sona Kahar of Mandriya village, was brought to the hospital around 2 am in a 108 ambulance. The family alleged that no doctor was present, and the duty nurse after a brief check said it was ""too early"" for delivery and went to rest.When labour pains intensified, Sona's mother-in-law took her to the washroom, where she delivered. The newborn slipped from her womb, hit the floor, and died immediately of head injuries, said sources.The family claims the baby cried briefly before dying, but hospital staff later declared the infant stillborn. They alleged that the hospital made them sign papers, collected a discharge fee, and handed over the dead child. A memorandum has been submitted to the administration demanding strict action. The family staged a protest at the facility.The next day, on the directions of SDM Prabhat Mishra, the Block Medical Officer visited the victim's home to record her statement. As her condition worsened, she was readmitted.Hospital authorities maintained the baby was stillborn. A duty doctor's report said intra-uterine deaths can happen at any stage of pregnancy. However, experts admitted that without a thorough medical examination, it could not be conclusively said whether the infant died in the womb or after delivery.Chhindwara district collector Sheelendra Singh told TOI: ""Staff nurse Veena Thakur has been suspended for negligence after the initial probe.

Moscow’s statement





Nato's response





Global reactions







Russia on Saturday denied that three of its fighter jets violated Estonian airspace on Friday, insisting that its aircraft flew only over neutral waters.Tallinn on Friday said three MiG-31 fighter jets crossed into its airspace over the Gulf of Finland, staying for 12 minutes before Italian F-35s forced them to withdraw. The incursion took place near Vaindloo Island, about 100 kilometres from the capital.Officials added that the aircraft did not file flight plans, their transponders were switched off, and they were not in contact with air traffic control. Estonia summoned a Russian diplomat in protest.Foreign minister Margus Tsahkna called the incident “unprecedentedly brazen,” noting, as quoted by Reuters, “Russia has violated Estonian airspace four times already this year, which is unacceptable in itself, but today’s violation, during which three fighter jets entered our airspace, is unprecedentedly brazen.”The Russian defence ministry dismissed the accusations. “During the flight, the Russian aircraft did not deviate from the agreed flight path and did not violate Estonian airspace,” it said.According to Moscow, the jets were flying from northwest Russia to Kaliningrad “over neutral waters of the Baltic Sea.”“The flight was carried out in strict conformity with international rules governing airspace with no violation of the borders of other states as is confirmed by independent checks,” the ministry wrote on Telegram.Nato confirmed its jets intercepted the Russian aircraft. “Earlier today, Russian jets violated Estonian airspace. Nato responded immediately and intercepted the Russian aircraft. This is yet another example of reckless Russian behaviour and Nato's ability to respond,” a spokesperson said on X.The alliance patrols the skies over Estonia and other Baltic states under its “Baltic Sentry” mission.US President Donald Trump said he had not yet been briefed on the incident. “I don’t love it. I don’t like when that happens,” he told reporters. “Could be big trouble. I’ll let you know later.”Ukraine condemned the move as “an unacceptable new destabilisation measure.” President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Telegram, as quoted by Reuters, “Strong action is needed, both jointly and from individual countries.”French President Emmanuel Macron also expressed solidarity with Estonia. “I strongly cndemn the incursions of Russian aircraft into Estonia. They represent yet another step in Russia’s accumulation of provocations and irresponsible actions. I extend my full support to the Estonian authorities. A security posture will be adopted in response to these repeated violations,” he wrote on X.The airspace clash came three days after Russia and Belarus completed their large-scale “Zapad-2025” military exercises, which included rehearsals of nuclear weapons use. It also followed an earlier drone incursion into Polish airspace that Western officials described as a test of Nato's readiness.",Three MiG-31 fighter jets crossed into Estonian airspace over the Gulf of Finland on Friday.

US President Donald Trump on Friday slammed US media coverage that portrayed him negatively, calling it “illegal” and claiming that networks report “97 per cent bad” news about him, although he did not provide any evidence to support the figure.The remarks have reignited debate over free speech following the suspension of comedian Jimmy Kimmel ’s television show by ABC.“They’ll take a great story and they’ll make it bad. See, I think it’s really illegal, personally,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, reiterating his long-standing view that coverage of him and his administration is overwhelmingly hostile, according to news agency AFP.The 79-year-old Republican has sued several major news organizations this year, including The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, as part of his ongoing criticism of US media.Trump also defended Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr, whose recent threats to broadcasters over Kimmel’s remarks about conservative activist Charlie Kirk have sparked a national debate. “He’s an incredible American patriot with courage.”The controversy began when Kimmel suggested on his show that “many in MAGA land are working very hard to capitalize on the murder of Charlie Kirk.”Within 24 hours, Carr condemned the comments as “truly sick” and hinted that ABC could face regulatory consequences, including fines or potential license actions.Shortly afterward, ABC announced Kimmel’s show would be suspended indefinitely.Trump’s remarks followed his previous statements aboard Air Force One, where he suggested networks broadcasting negative coverage of him could face government punishment, even hinting that their licenses “maybe” should be revoked. “Again, 97% negative, and yet I won easily. I won all seven swing states,” he said.Not all Republicans agreed with Trump’s stance. Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a close ally, warned that it is dangerous for the government to dictate which speech it may or may not like.President Trump recently filed a $15 billion lawsuit against The New York Times, accusing the newspaper of participating in a decades-long smear campaign aimed at damaging him politically. However, the case suffered a setback when a federal judge dismissed it as without merit.","US President Donald Trump slammed US media coverage that portrayed him negatively.

"'Contrary to national interest': Trump admin asks SC to revoke TPS for 300,000 Venezuelans; slams lower court order",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/contrary-to-national-interest-trump-admin-asks-sc-to-revoke-tps-for-300000-venezuelans-slams-lower-court-order/articleshow/124008805.cms,"Donald Trump and US Supreme Court (AP images)





US President Donald Trump 's administration on Friday asked the Supreme Court to overturn deportation protections extended to roughly 300,000 Venezuelans living in the United States, accusing a lower court of issuing a “needless affront” by ruling otherwise.The case centers on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ’s decision earlier this year to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS), a form of humanitarian relief granted to Venezuelan migrants.The administration noted that, as long as the district court’s order stands, over 300,000 Venezuelans would remain in the United States despite Secretary Noem’s determination that doing so even temporarily is “contrary to the national interest.”Beyond this policy, the case raises broader questions about how courts, including the Supreme Court, handle fast-tracked emergency appeals under Trump’s second term.Friday’s appeal is the second emergency petition submitted to the Supreme Court that day and highlights an ongoing debate within the judiciary: how much weight lower courts should give to brief or vague Supreme Court emergency orders.Earlier this year, in May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to move forward with ending TPS protections while the case continued in lower courts, despite a dissent from liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.A federal judge in California later issued a new order siding with the Venezuelans, temporarily blocking the policy again.In its latest emergency appeal, the administration criticized US District Judge Edward Chen and the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals for taking what it called an “indefensible” position by blocking the policy once more, as reported by CNN.The administration also argued that the lack of reasoning in the Supreme Court’s initial order does not excuse lower courts from following it. “Whether those orders span one sentence or many pages, disregarding them – as the lower courts did here – is unacceptable,” it said.Some lower court judges have expressed uncertainty over how to handle cases when the Supreme Court provides little explanation on emergency rulings. “They’re telling us nothing,” US Circuit Judge James Wynn said during an oral argument earlier this month in a case concerning whether the Department of Government Efficiency can access Social Security data.A key issue in the case is whether Secretary Noem had the authority to end the existing TPS designation before it was scheduled to expire.The former President Joe Biden 's administration initially granted TPS for Venezuelans in March 2021 due to political instability in the country and expanded it in 2023. Two weeks before Trump took office, the Biden administration renewed the protections for another 18 months.Venezuelan migrants covered under TPS have challenged Noem’s reversal, arguing it violated the Administrative Procedure Act, which requires federal agencies to follow specific procedures when changing policies. They also contend that the decision was motivated by political and racial bias.","The case centers on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ’s decision earlier this year to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) The case raises broader questions about how courts, including the Supreme Court, handle fast-tracked emergency appeals under Trump’s second term.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124008881,imgsize-977968,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

US President Donald Trump ’s administration on Friday escalated its campaign against Harvard University by placing new restrictions on the Ivy League school’s access to federal funds for student aid, citing concerns about the ""financial position"" of the nation’s oldest and wealthiest university.The US Department of Education said Harvard has been moved to a “heightened cash monitoring” status, which requires the university to use its own money to disburse student aid before being reimbursed.It also directed Harvard to provide a $36 million letter of credit to guarantee its financial obligations, pointing to the school’s recent bond issuances and staff layoffs as causes for concern, news agency Reuters reported.“While Harvard remains eligible to participate in the federal student aid program for now, these actions are necessary to protect taxpayers,” Education Secretary Linda McMahon said.The department further warned that Harvard could lose access to federal student aid if it fails to comply with records requests from the Office of Civil Rights, which is investigating whether the university still considers race in admissions despite the Supreme Court’s 2023 ruling against affirmative action.Harvard, with an endowment of $53 billion, has denied being in financial trouble but acknowledged that federal actions have strained its budget. In July, it estimated the impact of the Trump administration’s measures at nearly $1 billion annually.Earlier this month, a federal judge ruled that the government had unlawfully terminated more than $2 billion in research grants awarded to Harvard.The restrictions are the latest step in a larger confrontation. The Trump administration has accused Harvard of harboring “radical left” ideologies and failing to curb antisemitism, while targeting its funding, admissions policies and international student programs.Harvard has mounted multiple legal challenges, calling the measures unlawful and politically motivated. It has sued over frozen research grants and directives threatening international students, with courts granting temporary relief in some cases.Trump has personally taken aim at the university. During a recent cabinet meeting, he said Harvard should pay “nothing less than $500 million,” accusing the institution of having “been very bad.”",The US Department of Education said Harvard has been moved to a “heightened cash monitoring’ status.

US Vice-President JD Vance has said that national unity is impossible with people who celebrate the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk , warning that such behaviour fuels further political violence.Speaking as guest host of The Charlie Kirk Show on Monday, Vance said: “Call them out, and hell, call their employer. We don't believe in political violence, but we do believe in civility.”The vice-president took over presenting duties from his ceremonial office at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, with the programme livestreamed into the White House press briefing room. It was the first episode of the podcast since Kirk, 31, was fatally shot in the neck while moderating a debate at Utah Valley University last week.Vance, who flew Kirk’s body home to Arizona aboard Air Force Two, said he was “filling in for somebody who cannot be filled in for”. He recounted conversations with Kirk’s widow Erika, describing him as “a kind, loving husband”, and admitted her words had inspired him to “be a better husband and… a better father”.In his remarks, Vance directly challenged those making light of Kirk’s assassination. “There is no unity with the people who celebrate Charlie Kirk's assassination,” he said.“There is no unity with someone who lies about what Charlie Kirk said in order to excuse his murder… And there is no unity with the people who fund these articles, who pay the salaries of these terrorist sympathisers who argue that Charlie Kirk, a loving husband and father, deserved a shot to the neck because he spoke words with which they disagree. ”He added: “I’m desperate for our country to be united in condemnation of the actions and the ideas that killed my friend. I want it so badly that I will tell you a difficult truth. We can only have it with people who acknowledge that political violence is unacceptable.”Other Republicans have echoed calls for accountability. Florida congressman Randy Fine said he would “demand their firing, defunding, and licence revocation”, while South Carolina’s Nancy Mace urged federal funding to be cut from universities that refuse to act.Vance, who described Kirk as a close friend and mentor, credited him with helping President Donald Trump’s re-election and with shaping the administration. “If it weren't for Charlie Kirk, I would not be the vice president of the United States,” he said.","US Vice-President JD Vance said national unity is impossible with people who celebrate the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

The Trucial States and British Control: Foundations of UAE National Day





1820–1853: A series of treaties were signed between Britain and the ruling sheikhs, starting with the defeat of the Qawasim maritime force. These agreements aimed to curb maritime conflict, prohibit the construction of warships or coastal fortifications, and maintain peace at sea.

1853: The Perpetual Maritime Truce formalized an indefinite end to hostilities at sea. Britain limited its role to maritime security without interfering in the internal governance of the emirates.

1892: The Exclusive Agreements prohibited the Trucial States from engaging with foreign powers without British approval. In exchange, the UK pledged military protection against external threats.



Path to federation: Early steps toward UAE National Day





February 18, 1968: Sheikh Zayed met with Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum of Dubai at Al Samha . They agreed to unite their emirates and invite others to join, forming the first step toward regional federation — the Union Accord.



They agreed to collaborate on foreign affairs, defense, security, social services, and immigration policy. Judicial and internal governance would remain under individual emirate control.

February 25–27, 1968: Rulers from Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al Quwain , Fujairah, Ras Al Khaimah , Bahrain, and Qatar met in Dubai to draft a federal framework.



The proposed Federation of the Arab Emirates was based on 11 foundational principles including mutual respect for sovereignty, unified foreign policy, and joint developmental goals. A Supreme Council was to be established to oversee federal legislation and policy, with decisions requiring unanimous consent.

December 2, 1971: The birth of the UAE and National Day





July 18, 1971: The six Rulers formally agreed to establish a federation.

December 2, 1971: The United Arab Emirates was officially declared an independent, sovereign state.



A Provisional Constitution was adopted. Abu Dhabi was designated as the temporary capital. Sheikh Zayed was elected as the first President; Sheikh Rashid became Vice-President, both for a five-year term. The Federal National Council (FNC) was established with 34 seats:



8 each for Abu Dhabi and Dubai 6 for Sharjah 4 each for Ajman, Umm Al Quwain, and Fujairah Ras Al Khaimah was allocated 6 seats should it choose to join later.



UAE National Day: Completion of the union, constitution, and global standing

The constitution

The Provisional Constitution guided federal operations from 1971 until it was made permanent in July 1996.

It consists of 152 articles, establishing the foundation of:



Governance Distribution of federal and local powers Citizens’ rights National security, judiciary, and legislative structure



Federal goals outlined in the constitution:

Preserve the UAE’s independence and sovereignty

Ensure security and stability

Defend against any external aggression

Protect citizens' rights and freedoms

Promote economic prosperity, better standards of living, and unified national identity

Uphold each emirate’s internal autonomy within the constitutional framework

Why the federation worked

Common language and religion

Shared customs, traditions, and topography

Complementary economic resources

December 2, 1971: Joined the Arab League as its 18th member

December 9, 1971: Gained admission to the United Nations

1972: Became a member of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC)

1981: Co-founded the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman.





December 2 marks a pivotal moment in the history of the United Arab Emirates — the day it became an independent, sovereign nation in 1971. But the choice of this date was not symbolic alone; it was the culmination of decades of treaties, negotiations, British withdrawal, and a shared vision among the region's leaders. This is the detailed story of how the UAE came to be, why December 2 became its National Day, and the constitutional foundations that shaped the Federation.The territory that is now the UAE was historically known as the Trucial States, a group of independent emirates along the southern coast of the Persian Gulf. British involvement in the region began in the early 19th century:British control over the region intensified in the mid-20th century, largely driven by oil exploration and geopolitical interests. They controlled oil concession grants and intervened in territorial disputes to secure exploration zones, including helping define inter-emirate boundaries in the 1950s.However, by 1968, economic constraints pushed the UK to announce a full military and political withdrawal from the Gulf by end of 1971. This move set off a chain of political activity among the Trucial States’ rulers to form a new, self-governed entity before the British departure.The initiative to form a unified state began with Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, who became Ruler of Abu Dhabi in 1966. Seeing the necessity of regional cooperation, he envisioned a federation that could unify resources and political will.Despite this progress, Bahrain and Qatar opted for independent statehood in August and September 1971, respectively.As the British exit approached, six emirates — Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al Quwain, and Fujairah — committed to forming a new union.The Supreme Council of Rulers, composed of the Rulers of each emirate, became the highest federal authority. Decisions would require a majority vote — with both Abu Dhabi and Dubai needed to be part of the majority for any decision to pass.Article 138 specifically enabled the unification of the UAE Armed Forces under federal command, ensuring centralized defense policy and organization.Several shared factors helped facilitate a smooth transition to federation:Immediately after its formation, the UAE began establishing itself as a credible state in the international community:","December 2 marks the UAE’s formation, uniting seven emirates into a strong, independent federation.

US attorney investigating Trump ‘adversary’ Letitia James for fraud to be removed; DOJ 'pushing' to charge New York AG – report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-attorney-investigating-trump-adversary-letitia-james-for-fraud-to-be-removed-doj-pushing-to-charge-new-york-ag-report/articleshow/124006418.cms,"Erik Seibert; Donald Trump; Letitia James





Erik Siebert, the US attorney whose office has been investigating mortgage fraud allegations against New York attorney general Letitia James , has been told he is being removed from the position, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press on Friday.The move comes amid efforts by the Donald Trump administration to pursue criminal charges against James, who has been viewed as a ""political adversary"" of the US president.According to ABC News, Seibert had been ""resisting"" effort to charge James.Siebert, a career prosecutor, joined the Eastern District of Virginia in 2010, becoming part of an elite Justice Department office known for handling complex national security and criminal cases. A former District of Columbia police officer, he was nominated as US attorney by Trump in May with the support of Virginia’s Democratic senators, Mark Warner and Tim Kaine.It was unclear which official informed Siebert of his removal, the reasoning given, or who might replace him. No public announcement had been made by Friday afternoon, and spokespeople for his office and the Justice Department declined to comment.The allegations against James involve paperwork discrepancies related to her Brooklyn townhouse and a Virginia home. The Justice Department has been investigating for months but has not brought any charges, and there has been no indication that prosecutors have found evidence sufficient to secure an indictment.Her lawyers have strongly denied the allegations, calling the investigation an act of “political revenge.”The New York attorney general has long been a target of Trump’s criticism, in part due to a civil lawsuit she filed against him and his company that resulted in a substantial financial penalty. That penalty was overturned last month by an appeals court, which narrowly upheld a judge’s finding that Trump had engaged in fraud by inflating his wealth over decades.","Erik Siebert, the US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, has been told he is being removed from the position.

Hundreds March In NYC Urging Trump To Stop U.S. Arms To Israel Amid Gaza Starvation Crisis





In a renewed show of support for Israel, which faces growing global isolation over the Gaza war, the Donald Trump administration has notified Congress of plans to sell nearly $6 billion in weapons to the US ally.According to a US official cited by the Associated Press, the package includes a $3.8 billion deal for 30 AH-64 Apache helicopters—almost doubling Israel’s current fleet—and a $1.9 billion sale for 3,200 infantry assault vehicles. Delivery is expected to take at least two to three years.The State Department declined to comment on the proposal, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.The development comes as Washington struggles to broker an end to the nearly two-year conflict. Peace talks have stalled, particularly after Israel’s recent strike on Hamas leaders in Doha, Qatar.Despite mounting international criticism and efforts by some Senate Democrats to block offensive arms transfers, the Trump administration has remained steadfast in backing Israel, whose latest offensive in Gaza City has drawn widespread condemnation.The previous Biden administration had paused shipments of 2,000-pound bombs over concerns about civilian casualties, but Trump reversed that hold after taking office in January.

Former US transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg — revealed by Kamala Harris as her initial first choice for running mate before she ultimately selected Minnesota governor Tim Walz — said he was ""surprised"" by the disclosure, arguing that it is wrong to assume Americans would not vote for a Black woman as president and a gay man as vice president.“I believe in giving Americans more credit than assuming they couldn’t vote for a Black woman and a gay man on the same presidential ticket,” Buttigieg told Politico. He added: ""My experience in politics has been that the way you earn trust with voters is based mostly on what they think you’re going to do for their lives, not on categories… Politics is about the results we can get for people and not about these other things. ”In her memoir 107 Days — set for release September 23 — Harris writes that Buttigieg topped her initial list of eight potential running mates before she ultimately chose Walz. The then–vice president explained she felt it would be “too big of a risk” to ask voters to back a ticket led by a Black woman married to a Jewish man and paired with an openly gay running mate.“Part of me wanted to say, ‘Screw it, let’s just do it,’” Harris writes.“But knowing what was at stake, it was too big of a risk.” She added that Buttigieg “also knew that — to our mutual sadness.”Buttigieg disputed that claim, saying such a discussion never took place between them.The book’s title refers to the 107 days between July 21, 2024, when then-President Joe Biden announced he would not seek re-election, and November 5 (Election Day). Harris, elevated to the Democratic ticket, ultimately lost with Walz to the Republican duo of Donald Trump and JD Vance — not only in the Electoral College but also in the national popular vote.The outcome marked Trump’s return to the White House, four years after his loss to Joe Biden in 2020 while serving as the incumbent president.","Former US transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg was revealed by Kamala Harris as her initial first choice for running mate before she ultimately selected Minnesota governor Tim Walz.

More Than 150,000 Evacuated in Pakistan Punjab After India’s Flood Alert

Relief in Jalalpur Pirwala, Alipur

Waters recede, but threat not over

Fields and cattle lost





Even as floodwaters began to recede in parts of south Punjab, the scale of destruction remains staggering, nearly 2.5 million people have been forced to flee their homes and at least 101 lives have been lost, the Dawn reported.The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has called the ongoing evacuation and relief drive one of the largest in recent memory. More than 1,500 boats were deployed to rescue stranded families, with 12,427 people evacuated from villages along the Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej rivers.Multan, Muzaffargarh and Rahim Yar Khan districts bore the brunt of the floods. Entire villages were submerged — including the union council of Lati Mari in Alipur tehsil, home to 40,000 people.“Nearly 15,000 people from our basti had to leave on their own as water rose,” said Syed Kausar Shah, a local resident. “Homes and crops were destroyed, and people escaped on a hired boat. Some now live in relief camps, others under the open sky.” He added that two villagers drowned while attempting to flee.Officials declared Jalalpur Pirwala and Alipur tehsils safe after a major flood wave passed through Head Panjnad.Multan Deputy Commissioner Waseem Hamid Sindhu confirmed that 100,000 people had been evacuated from Jalalpur Pirwala alone in three days.Breaches in Shujabad and Jalalpur Pirwala are now being filled, while helicopters and drones drop food and medicine into cut-off areas. Boats continue to ferry supplies into rural belts.At a press briefing in Bahawalpur, PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said Panjnad Headworks still faced a “high flood” but levels had dropped from 700,000 cusecs earlier this week to 575,000 cusecs on Saturday. By evening, the Flood Forecasting Division reported further decline to 492,695 cusecs.“There is no threat to Jalalpur Pirwala and Alipur cities,” Kathia assured, adding that water in Bahawalpur would also recede within 24 hours. He called the scale of evacuation “historic,” stressing that Multan could have faced forced evacuations if operations were delayed.According to official data, 4,447 mouzas across 28 districts have been inundated. Alongside the mass displacement of people, more than 2.19 million cattle were rescued and shifted to higher ground.For now, the rivers appear to be calming, the Sutlej at Ganda Singh Wala was recorded at 95,000 cusecs, categorised as medium flood. But for the millions already uprooted, the crisis has only just begun.","Nearly 2.5 million people have been forced to flee their homes and at least 101 lives have been lost.

Protests Erupt in Pakistan, as Imran Khan Supporters Call for His Release

“

(With ANI inputs)





The sons of jailed former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said their father “will not be broken” by his “unlawful” imprisonment, as his legal team lodged an appeal with the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture.The elder son, Sulaiman Khan, condemned Khan's treatment in a statement attached to the appeal:Our father is being kept in conditions that no human being should endure. These are violations of his rights, and they amount to torture.”The younger son, Kasim Khan, said:The UN has already recognised that our father’s imprisonment is arbitrary and unlawful. What he is enduring now shows how far the regime will go to break him. But he will not be broken.”Sulaiman and Kasim are the cricketer-turned-politician’s sons with British filmmaker Jemima Goldsmith, with whom he was married for nine years until 2004. They live in the UK with Goldsmith.The appeal, filed by the US-based law firm Perseus Strategies on behalf of Khan’s legal team, alleged a “systematic pattern of abuse, including prolonged solitary confinement, denial of medical care, contaminated food, and restricted access to legal counsel and family visits.”His lawyers argued that these conditions breach Pakistan’s obligations under the UN Convention against Torture (CAT) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). They urged the UN to press authorities to safeguard the former PM’s physical and mental well-being.Khan has been in prison since August 2023 after being charged in multiple cases.","The sons of jailed former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said their father “will not be broken” by his “unlawful” imprisonment.
