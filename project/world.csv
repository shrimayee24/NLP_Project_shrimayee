PM Modi to visit Cyprus in the middle of Turkiye-Pakistan solidarity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-to-visit-cyprus-in-the-middle-of-turkiye-pakistan-solidarity/articleshow/121742472.cms,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi (File photo)

NEW DELHI: As India works to expand its footprint in Europe, PM Narendra Modi will visit Cyprus on his way to Canada for the G7 summit and Croatia while returning home.Both Cyprus and Croatia are members of the EU and the former will hold the rotating presidency of the EU Council for the first half of the next year. Modi was scheduled to travel to Croatia last month, along with the Netherlands and Norway, but the visit had to be postponed because of the military tensions between India and Pakistan.The G7 summit takes place at Kananaskis in Alberta from June 15 to 17, with Modi participating in the outreach session on the last day. The eleventh hour invitation by Canada means that PM’s programme is yet to be finalised but government sources said efforts are underway to schedule bilateral meetings.The visit to Cyprus, only the 3rd by an Indian PM after A B Vajpayee in 2002 and Indira Gandhi in 1983, will also be followed closely as it comes in the middle of tensions between India and Turkiye over the latter’s support to Pakistan - and the show of solidarity by President Recep Erdogan himself - during the India-Pakistan military clash last month.Ankara’s recognition of the so-called Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in the northern region that was seized by Turkish forces in 1974 and differences over gas exploration rights in the Eastern Mediterranean remain a constant source of tensions between Turkiye and Cyprus.India has consistently backed solution of what is known as the Cyprus problem through UNSC resolutions and international law.As Turkiye stands solidly with Pakistan, India has sought to strengthen ties with both Cyprus and Greece, focusing on defence and security cooperation. Modi became the first Indian PM to visit Greece in 40 years when he travelled to Athens in 2023.Both countries have supported India on issues concerning terrorism and also on Kashmir. According to the MEA, Cyprus has backed India on a number of significant issues like India’s election to UNSC, the India-US Civil Nuclear Agreement, NSG membership and also the 1998 nuclear tests.Modi’s visit to Croatia on his way back will also be the first visit by any Indian PM to the country. S Jaishankar became the first Indian foreign minister to visit the southeast European country in 2021 as the 2 countries looked to expand bilateral ties. Two years later, India and Croatia also signed an MoU for defence cooperation.","PM Narendra Modi will visit Cyprus on his way to Canada for the G7 summit.

AGRA: Days after a woman's charred body was found in a forest in Muzaffarnagar, police have arrested her father and brother for allegedly strangling her and setting her body on fire.Saraswati Maliyan, 23, who worked with an e-commerce MNC in Gurgaon, handling orders and last-mile delivery, had been in a live-in relationship with Amit, a man from her village. Police said her father, Rajveer Singh, 55, and brother, Sumit Singh, 24, a truck driver, confessed to killing her when she visited home as they were opposed to the relationship.Saraswati, police said, had been forced into marriage in 2019 but left her husband after two years. ""Another marriage was arranged by her family in 2022 but that didn't wotk out either. She later began living with a man called Amit in Gurgaon, where both started working with the e-com firm that same year. Despite pressure from her family, she continued the relationship and returned to her village in Muzaffarnagar on May 10 to persuade her parents to accept it. Amit told us he last heard from her on May 26, when she said it would be her final attempt to convince them,"" an officer investigating the case said.The officer added that the murder was carried out on the night of May 29–30. Rajveer and Sumit allegedly strangled Saraswati inside their home, while a third accused, Gurdayal Singh, a friend of Sumit's, held her legs. The trio then carried her body about 5km into a forest near a canal, poured petrol on it and set it ablaze.Two days later, the family filed a missing person's report to mislead the police. The investigation shifted course when a half-burnt body was found in a forest in Kakrauli police station area on June 3. Initial identification was difficult due to the state of the body. ""However, SHO Joginder Singh and constable Lalit Moral noticed bangles on the woman's wrist and matched them with a post on a social media platform. The jewellery helped us confirm her identity,"" Muzaffarnagar SSP Sanjay Kumar Verma said.Verma added, ""Rajveer admitted to killing his daughter out of anger over her relationship. The third accused, Gurdayal Singh, is absconding and we are conducting raids to arrest him.""A case has been filed under BNS sections 103 (murder) and 238 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence or giving false information to screen offender). Legal proceedings are under way. The efforts of the SHO and the constable have been recognised with a cash reward.","Saraswati Maliyan, 23, worked with an e-commerce MNC in Gurgaon, handling orders and last-mile delivery.

US Navy permanently ends dog and cat testing after activist pressure

PETA reacts to the initiative for animals by White Coast Waste members

A major win for the innocents





White Coat Waste Project uncovered a $10 Navy-funded lab that was performing painful experiments on cats, some of which were already disabled. The experiments involved tests and electroshocking experiments on the cats as a part of strange and disturbing research on things like constipation and erectile problems. After their relentless investigation and public campaign, the US Navy has officially announced a ban on all experiments involving dogs and cats. With this, a very painful chapter of government-funded abuse comes to an end.According to WAN, the White Coast investigators uncovered the barbaric practices, exposing them to the public through international media outlets. The shocking news led to a huge response from regular people all over the country, including concerned taxpayers, animal lovers, and pet ownersAnthony Bellotti, President and Founder of White Coat Waste, told WAN “White Coat Waste didn’t just shut down this one cat crippling lab—we ended all future dog and cat testing by the Navy, for good. As someone who’s proudly adopted several cat survivors who were rescued after White Coat Waste shut down their labs, this victory is deeply personal. Knowing that no more puppies or kittens will suffer behind Navy lab doors makes this a defining moment in the movement to end animal testing. ”“We’re grateful to Secretary John Phelan, Pete Hegseth, and the Trump Administration for this policy. Pets are family. For too long, beloved dogs and cats were abused in secretive government labs.That era is ending—because White Coat Waste is ending it. The solution is simple: Stop the Money. Stop the Madness,” added Bellotti.According to the reports, the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) penned a letter to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Navy Secretary John Phelan, thanking the Trump administration for its ban on Navy-funded dog and cat experiments and requesting a broader ban on all animal testing in all the military branches.PETA Vice President Shalin Gala wrote in a statement, ""PETA appreciates the Trump administration’s decision to stop the Navy’s torture tests on dogs and cats, and we urge a broader ban across the Pentagon to end the use of animals in Navy-funded decompression sickness and oxygen toxicity tests, Army-funded weapon-wounding tests and DOD-funded foreign experiments.PETA further urged the Department of Defense to conduct a similar comprehensive, agency-wide audit aimed at rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse in cruel and outdated animal experimentationFor the public and members of the White Coat Waste team who have adopted rescued animals from closed-down government labs, this mission is very personal. Knowing that no more puppies or kittens will suffer behind Navy lab doors marks a powerful and emotional victory.With this major win, we must continue to push for the end of animal testing nationwide, once and for all.","US Navy permanently ends dog and cat testing after activist pressure.

Derek Guy, also known as Menswear Guy, who is well-known on X for his men's fashion tips and analysis, claimed on the social media platform that he came to the US from Canada as a child and never had any documentation. The long post detailing his family's migration from Canada to the US came as ICE raided several locations in Los Angeles arresting illegal aliens -- leading to riots. Social media users tagged Vice President JD Vance and alerted him about the illegal status of Deek Guy, to which the vice president responded with a GIF, suggesting that he would be deported.Derek Guy said there is a perception that millions of violent criminals are pouring across the border carrying drugs but not everyone falls in the same category.""My family escaped Vietnam after the Tet Offensive and went through an arduous journey that eventually landed them in Canada. My father worked there for a time as a janitor; my mother, a secretary. When work fell through, my dad was offered to work with his sister in the United States, so he went, as our family needed money.

Maharajganj Accident: 'Speeding toward dead end': App leads car to unfinished flyover in UP; vehicle dangles mid-air,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/app-leads-car-to-unfinished-flyover-vehicle-dangles-mid-air/articleshow/121737060.cms,"Guided by his digital map, the driver cruised along the Gorakhpur- Sonauli NH around 1am, oblivious to the lurking danger





LUCKNOW: What was supposed to be a routine late-night drive turned into a near-death experience when a car following a driving direction app ended up dangling from the edge of an unfinished flyover in Uttar Pradesh's Maharajganj. The lone occupant, a young man from Lucknow en route to Nepal via Gorakhpur, had no idea he was speeding toward a dead end — until it was almost too late.Guided by his digital map, the driver cruised along the Gorakhpur-Sonauli national highway around 1am, oblivious to the lurking danger. The app led him straight onto an under-construction flyover near Bhaiya Pharenda village. With no barricades, warning signs, or diversion indicators to stop him, the car shot up the incomplete bridge at high speed. Then came the horror. As his headlights cut through the darkness, they revealed a terrifying truth: the road ahead simply ended. Before he could process the sight, instincts took over. He slammed the brakes, but the car, propelled by its own momentum, skidded forward and teetered off the edge. For a split second, death loomed.Instead of plummeting into the abyss, the car miraculously came to rest on a mound of rubble and soft earth beneath the flyover.A few more inches and it would have been fatal. The driver, dazed and shaken but alive, scrambled out of the vehicle and disappeared into the darkness.Soon afterwards, police from Pharenda station arrived, only to find the vehicle empty. The car, a Lucknow-registered vehicle owned by Haris Siddiqui of Ramgarh (Gorakhpur), was later returned in the presence of two witnesses. Siddiqui refused to press charges, perhaps still stunned by how close the disaster came. SHO Shant Pathak said, ""The driver had minor injuries and fled. The vehicle was empty, and we're investigating. ""","A car following a driving direction app ended up dangling from the edge of an unfinished flyover in Uttar Pradesh's Maharajganj.

"'If she had a lover, why not just walk out of marriage. Why kill Raja?': Indore family seeks answers from Sonam Raghuvanshi",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/happy-to-marry-whoever-you-choose-sonam-had-told-father/articleshow/121737278.cms,"



Sonam Raghuvanshi, now arrested for murdering her husband on their honeymoon, was asked during the matchmaking if she was happy with the wedding proposal from Raja Raghuvanshi's family, and she said yes, according to her father.As both families struggle to come to terms with the brutal murder and Sonam's alleged role in it, the question Raja's family asks is, why did she go ahead with the marriage, and if she had a lover, why not just walk out of it. Why kill Raja?The marriage was fixed through traditional and community-based means, say family sources. The couple tied the knot on May 11 in what both families believed was a well-matched, arranged marriage. Speaking to TOI, Raja's mother Uma Raghuvanshi recalled, ""It all happened like any other arranged marriage. We had submitted Raja's profile for publication in our community booklet as well as on social media in October last year. When we came across Sonam's profile and her family reached out, we agreed to meet.""Raja's family consulted several relatives and acquaintances who lived near Sonam's family. ""Everyone we spoke to had only good things to say about her.Based on their positive feedback, we decided to go ahead,"" Uma said. The families met multiple times before the wedding.""They visited our home, and we went to theirs. Everything appeared normal and the atmosphere was warm and welcoming,"" she added.Sonam's father, Devi Singh, said, ""When we were discussing the proposal, Sonam was sitting with a friend. I asked her clearly if she had someone else in mind. She immediately said no, and told me she would marry whoever I chose for her,"" he told TOI. ""In fact, she even asked her friend to tell me not to bring up such questions again, as she fully trusted my decision."" By all appearances, it was a conventional and respectful union — one that both families believed had been carefully and sincerely matched. No one had a clue to the horror that would unfold.","Sonam Raghuvanshi, now arrested for murdering her husband on their honeymoon, was asked during the matchmaking if she was happy with the wedding proposal, according to her father.

BENGALURU: A reunion of a 33-year-old married woman and her 25-year-old lover at a hotel in South Bengaluru's Poornaprajna Housing Society Layout recently ended in the murder. The youth stabbed the woman, mother of two children, 13 times after she revealed her decision to end the relationship.The accused, Yashas from Kengeri Satellite Town, informed police about the murder after stabbing himself.The deceased is Harini R, a resident of Hemmigepura in Banashankari 6th Stage.Yashas, a BCA graduate and employee of a private firm, attacked Harini with a knife while she was resting in the room at 9.30pm on June 6, police said.

Greta Thunberg's LAST VIDEO: Claims 'Kidnapped By Israeli Forces' In International Waters

BIG! Zelensky To Flee Ukraine Any Moment? ‘Secret Escape Plan’ Out As Russia Advances | Watch





Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg and 11 other international volunteers were detained on Monday evening after their aid ship, the Madleen, was intercepted by Israeli forces and brought to the port of Ashdod.The group had been trying to deliver humanitarian supplies to Gaza when their boat was stopped in international waters, according to organizers.Upon arrival in Israel, the activists underwent medical checks. Israel’s foreign ministry confirmed their detention, while defence minister Israel Katz said the group was shown footage of the Hamas-led October 7 attack on Israel.Defense minister Katz said they were shown a screening of ""the horror film documenting the October 7 massacre"" by Hamas, but ""when they saw what it was about, they refused to continue watching."" He accused Thunberg and others of ignoring Hamas atrocities by ""closing their eyes to the truth.""The Madleen was organised by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition (FFC), a group known for challenging Israel’s blockade on Gaza.The ship carried baby formula, food, and medical supplies meant for civilians in the war-torn territory.According to the FFC, Israeli forces used quadcopters to spray the deck with a white, paint-like substance, jam communications, and play disturbing sounds.In a livestream, one activist said the substance was irritating her eyes.Thunberg, in a pre-recorded video later posted by the group, said the ship had been “kidnapped in international waters by Israeli occupation forces.”Israeli authorities say the aid will be redirected to Gaza through official humanitarian channels. But FFC organizer and lawyer Huwaida Arraf said the interception violated international law and ignored a binding ruling from the International Court of Justice that calls for unrestricted humanitarian access to Gaza.Amnesty International echoed that concern. Its Secretary General Agnes Callamard said the nighttime operation in international waters was dangerous and unlawful.US President Donald Trump also commented on the incident, calling Thunberg “a strange, young, angry person” and sarcastically suggesting she take an “anger management class.” Still, he criticized the interception, saying, “Israel has enough problems without kidnapping Greta Thunberg.”Hamas called the operation a “flagrant violation of international law” and demanded the activists’ immediate release. In Ashdod, around 15 protesters gathered with placards reading “Resist genocide” and “Stop state terror.”France confirmed that six of the detainees are French citizens and said President Emmanuel Macron has requested their quick return. The French foreign ministry also called on Israel to allow large-scale humanitarian aid into Gaza without delay.The Madleen had left Sicily last week and had previously rescued four migrants off the coast of Libya during its journey. The FFC said the activists knew the risks, noting past flotillas had been attacked or blocked by Israel. In April, another flotilla vessel was allegedly hit by a drone near Malta, though Israel did not comment.Despite global pressure, only limited aid has reached Gaza. A UN-backed report in April warned that one in five people in Gaza faces starvation. The FFC said the seized shipment contained vital baby formula and medical supplies.Israel maintains a strict blockade on Gaza, especially during wartime, and has said unauthorized sea access to the territory will not be allowed.","Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg and 11 other international volunteers were detained on Monday evening after their aid ship, the Madleen, was intercepted by Israeli forces.

"Sonam Raghuvanshi's secret life: It all started when her MBA dreams ended, drawn into family business before murder plot",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/sonam-raghuvanshis-secret-life-it-all-started-when-her-mba-dreams-ended-drawn-into-family-business-before-murder-plot/articleshow/121741680.cms,"



INDORE: Sonam Raghuvanshi, now at the centre of a chilling honeymoon murder case involving the killing of her husband, Raja Raghuvanshi, once harboured dreams of pursuing an MBA. According to her relatives, she had completed her graduation and was preparing for further studies.However, her aspirations were quietly set aside when her family discouraged her from working outside. Instead, she was asked to assist her brother, Govind, in managing the family’s plywood business.It was in this very workplace that Sonam reportedly met Raj Kushwaha — the man now accused of helping her plot her husband's murder just days after their wedding.Raj had been handling billing and accounts in the family firm. Police say that behind his calm and composed exterior, he was hiding dangerous intent.During their trip to Meghalaya, Raja’s elder brother Vipin, who had accompanied Sonam’s brother Govind, grew suspicious when he overheard Govind speaking frequently with Raj. “Govind kept saying, ‘I’ve left everything to you, please manage the business while I’m away in Shillong,’” Vipin recalled. “Looking back, I’m sure Govind had no idea Raj was involved.None of us did.”Shockingly, just two days before the case broke open, Raj had even visited Sonam’s family, speaking to everyone as though nothing was amiss.“He came over and chatted with everyone,” Sonam’s father, Devi Singh, said. “We had no idea he might have been with Sonam or involved in this at all.”Investigators allege Raj masterminded the plan from behind the scenes, instructing his three childhood friends — Akash Rajput, Vishal Singh Chauhan, and Anand Kurmi — to travel to Meghalaya to carry out the murder, while he stayed back and coordinated everything remotely.Family members now speak of a betrayal that cut deep. Raj was someone they considered one of their own — sharing meals, business, and trust, all while allegedly playing a key role in a cold-blooded crime.As the investigation deepens, more disturbing layers continue to emerge — including the revelation that Sonam had, at the time of matchmaking, agreed to marry Raja willingly.“When we discussed the proposal, I asked her clearly if she liked someone else,” her father said.“She said no and told me she would marry whoever I chose. She even asked her friend to tell me not to raise the question again.”What appeared to be a respectful, traditional union between two families turned out to be a front for an unthinkable act of betrayal.","Sonam Raghuvanshi once harboured dreams of pursuing an MBA.

As the nation's capital cleans up from the culmination of World Pride this past weekend, focus now shifts to a very different massive event - Saturday's military parade to honor the 250th birthday of the Army and the 79th birthday of President Donald Trump.""We're preparing for an enormous turnout,"" said Matt McCool of the Secret Service's Washington Field office, who said more than 18 miles of ""anti-scale fencing"" would be erected and ""multiple drones"" would be in the air. The entire District of Columbia is normally a no-fly zone for drones.Army officials have estimated around 200,000 attendees for the evening military parade, and McCool said he was prepared for ""hundreds of thousands"" of people.""We have a ton of magnetometers,"" he said. ""If a million people show up, then we're going to have some lines.""A total of 175 magnetometers would be used at security checkpoints controlling access to the daytime birthday festival and the nighttime parade. Metropolitan Police Department chief Pamela Smith predicted ""major impacts to traffic"" and advised attendees to arrive early and consider forgoing cars for the Metro.""This is a significant event with a large footprint,"" she said. ""We're relying on the public to be an extra set of ears and eyes for us.""The military parade has been designated a National Special Security Event - similar to a presidential inauguration or state funeral. That status is reserved for events that draw large crowds and potential mass protests. It calls for an enhanced degree of high-level coordination among D.C. officials, the FBI, Capitol Police and Washington's National Guard contingent - with the Secret Service taking the lead.The Army birthday celebration had already been planned for months. But earlier this spring, Trump announced his intention to transform the event - which coincides with his 79th birthday - into a massive military parade complete with 60-ton M1 Abrams battle tanks and Paladin self-propelled howitzers rolling through the city streets.Multiple counter-protests of varying sizes are planned for Saturday, with the largest being a mass march to the White House dubbed the No Kings rally. Officials say they are also on alert for signs that the immigration-related clashes between law enforcement and protesters currently roiling Los Angeles would spread.""We're paying attention, obviously, to what is happening there. We'll be ready,"" McCool said. ""We have a robust plan for civil disobedience.""Agent Phillip Bates of the FBI's Washington Field office, which is tasked with counterterrorism and crisis management, said there were ""no credible threats"" to the event at the moment.Lindsey Appiah, the deputy mayor for public safety, told The Associated Press last week that the city had longstanding plans for the Army birthday celebration. But those plans ""got a lot bigger on short notice"" when Trump got involved.Still, Appiah said the city has grown ""very flexible, very nimble"" at rolling with these sort of changes.","The military parade has been designated a National Special Security Event - similar to a presidential inauguration or state funeral.

A deadly confrontation between two rival YouTubers unfolded live on camera Sunday night, leaving a man and a woman dead near the iconic Bellagio fountains in Las Vegas.Police say the shooting stemmed from a long-running social media feud and was captured on a livestream before the suspect fled, reports BNO news.The suspect, identified as 41-year-old Manuel Ruiz, turned himself in at the Henderson Police Department on Monday morning. He is expected to be charged with two counts of open murder with a deadly weapon, according to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.The shooting occurred around 10:40 p.m. on 3600 block of South Las Vegas Boulevard. Officers patrolling nearby heard gunshots and rushed to the scene where they found two victims with gunshot wounds. “Our officers rendered medical aid to both victims, but their efforts to save those victims’ lives were unsuccessful, and both victims were pronounced deceased at the scene,” Undersheriff Andrew Walsh said during a briefing.The victims have not been officially named by authorities, but online speculation and viral clips suggest they were YouTuber Finny Da Legend and his wife, known to fans as Bubbly. Finny was livestreaming at the time, and footage widely shared online shows a man, believed to be Ruiz, briefly appearing in the frame before a confrontation and gunfire erupted.According to Walsh, “the suspect and the victim had previously engaged in some type of conflict using a variety of social media platforms.” Though officials have not confirmed the motive, the evidence points to a personal dispute rooted in their online rivalry. “It appeared the suspect and one of the victims had feuded with each other in the past,” Walsh added.In the days prior to the shooting, Finny reportedly accused Ruiz, known online as SinCity-MannyWise or Sin City Manny, of being suicidal. Ruiz, in turn, posted several videos appearing to search for Finny around Las Vegas, hinting at a confrontation. These interactions are now under investigation.Police say that the incident appeared targeted and isolated. “What happened last night was a terrible act of hate and we are heart broken for the children and families on both sides, as well as the sorrow of losing our close friends,” said Marc Sanson, a YouTuber known as TheOtherMeLV, who knew both victims and the suspect.Clips of the shooting showed Bubbly confronting a man before he pulled out a gun and fired at someone off-screen, believed to be Finny. Screams followed as bystanders fled. A police officer later turned off the camera.The video has since been taken down from YouTube , and Ruiz’s channel “Sin City Family” has been removed for violating community guidelines. Finny’s channel remained live as of Monday, still displaying his last post from June 7.The area was temporarily cordoned off after the incident, but normal activity resumed the next morning. Locals and tourists expressed shock, but many praised the police for their quick response.","The shooting occurred around 10:40 p.m. on 3600 block of South Las Vegas Boulevard.

'Degrading and arbitrary ordeal': Goa doctors give health minister Vishwajit Rane 24 hours to apologise; threaten stir,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/gmc-doctors-give-goa-health-minister-rane-24-hours-to-apologise-in-casualty-department/articleshow/121736489.cms,"



PANAJI: In an unprecedented show of strength, over 600 doctors, consultants, and interns of Goa Medical College staged a protest on the campus on Monday demanding a public apology from health minister Vishwajit Rane at the same casualty department for abusing and threatening Rudresh Kuttikar and gave the minister a 24-hour ultimatum or face a strike.The doctors’ ultimatum came after Rane “extended heartfelt apology to Kuttikar for the harsh words” spoken by him on Saturday. But Kuttikar and the Goa Association of Resident Doctors (GARD) rejected Rane’s apology on social media and demanded a public apology at the same place where the incident took place, and a video of the apology to be made viral in the same way the first video was.GARD said that it “cannot and will not stand by while the dignity of our profession is trampled upon”. The doctors also demanded an end to VIP culture, a total ban on videography in patient care areas, and assurance from govt that no healthcare professional will ever be subjected to such a “degrading and arbitrary ordeal” again.The doctors also demanded the immediate and unconditional revocation of Kuttikar’s suspension, but dean S M Bandekar said there was no suspension order issued, no note moved, and no inquiry initiated against him.GARD presented a list of five demands to the dean, who called for a meeting of all heads of departments to discuss the issue.After the meeting, Bandekar told reporters that this was the “first incident” of this scale at GMC. “Something like this has never happened before on such a scale… and it is escalating. Somewhere we need to preserve this institution. It is one of the greatest in the country, and we cannot allow it to go for a toss,” he said, adding that many OPDs were delayed due to the protest on Monday.GARD president Aayush Sharma, however, countered the dean’s assertion, and said that no emergency or elective services were stopped, and that doctors attended to patients. He called for an end to VIP culture and said that on the same night following the Rane incident, four medical residents of the medicine department were verbally assaulted, threatened, and videographed by a patient’s relatives, who threatened to send the video to higher authorities and get them all fired. All doctors, especially the junior-most doctors at GMC, face regular threats from various higher authorities via someone, he said.“Everyone wants their patient to be treated first, and there’s no respect for hospital protocol or the triage system, where doctors decide which patient to attend to first,” he said. The VIP culture is prevalent all around India, said Sharma, and added that the same no-VIP culture guidelines and SOPs followed at AIIMS, New Delhi, and other medical colleges, should directly influence Goa’s SOPs.GARD’s former president Pratik Savant, speaking on behalf of all doctors at GMC, said that the protest was not political and not about one doctor.“It is about the whole medical fraternity being brought up by their teachers to stand up for self-respect and dignity. It’s not even about a doctor, but about the basic self-respect and dignity of a person,” he said, adding that doctors toiled during Covid-19 and during the recent Shirgao jatra stampede to save patients.Savant added that doctors spend years studying triage — deciding which patient to give preference to in an emergency situation — and that this should be left up to doctors. He said GARD’s demands were very simple and don’t require any external interference, adding that it would be a shame on doctors to let this incident go.","Over 600 doctors, consultants, and interns of Goa Medical College staged a protest on the campus on Monday. They demanded a public apology from health minister Vishwajit Rane at the same casualty department for abusing and threatening Rudresh Kuttikar. They also demanded an end to VIP culture, a total ban on videography in patient care areas, and assurance from govt that no healthcare professional will ever be subjected to such a “degrading and arbitrary ordeal” again.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121737606,imgsize-1065255,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/121737606.jpg"

Who is Brad Bondi? Pam Bondi's brother routed in DC Bar race; Seltzer wins with 90% margin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-brad-bondi-pam-bondis-brother-routed-in-dc-bar-race-seltzer-wins-with-90-margin/articleshow/121741344.cms,"Brad Bondi

Brad Bondi loses bid to lead DC Bar Association

Seltzer: A vote for transparency







Brad Bondi, a prominent white-collar defense attorney and brother of US attorney general Pam Bondi, suffered a resounding defeat in his bid to become president of the DC Bar, the mandatory bar association for over 120,000 legal professionals in Washington DC.Bondi, a partner at Paul Hastings LLP and co-chair of its investigations and white-collar defense practice, lost to employment attorney Diane Seltzer of The Seltzer Law Firm. The results, announced Monday by D.C. Bar CEO Robert Spagnoletti, marked a historic election with over 38,600 ballots cast, a dramatic increase from just 7,500 in the previous cycle. Seltzer won with more than 90% of the vote.According to Newsweek, Brad Bondi is well known in Washington legal circles for his work in securities enforcement and corporate investigations. He previously served as counsel to commissioners at the US Securities and Exchange Commission and has carved out a career defending high-profile clients in complex regulatory cases.But his deep connections to the Trump administration — particularly through his sister, Pam Bondi, who now serves as Attorney General under President Trump — fueled anxiety among many members of the legal community. That concern intensified earlier this year after Trump signed an executive order directing Pam Bondi to identify lawyers and law firms allegedly coaching clients to lie in immigration cases, with an eye toward disciplinary referrals.While the DC Bar president has no direct power over attorney discipline, the 23-member board does influence appointments to the panel that oversees the Office of Disciplinary Counsel — an indirect but meaningful role in shaping how the rules of professional conduct are enforced.Bondi’s candidacy, announced shortly after Trump’s executive order, was seen by some attorneys as an extension of the administration’s efforts to police the legal profession. Critics warned on social media that his election could bring political interference into what is traditionally viewed as a nonpartisan professional body.Bondi pushed back on those claims, insisting his campaign was focused on the bar’s governance and not politics. Still, the response from voters was decisive.In a statement after the election, Bondi acknowledged defeat but struck a defiant tone.“Although I did not prevail, I stand with a heart full of gratitude and a mind heavy with concern for the future of the DC Bar,” he said. “I am disgusted by how rabid partisans lurched this election into the political gutter, turning a professional campaign into baseless attacks, identity politics, and partisan recrimination.”Diane Seltzer, now set to lead the DC Bar, ran a campaign cantered on transparency and integrity. Ahead of the vote, she responded to growing unease over Bondi’s candidacy by assuring members that if elected, she would maintain the bar’s independence.“These are people who care deeply about the rule of law and the integrity of our bar,” Seltzer said. “If I’m elected president, everything will be done properly and transparently.”With the legal community watching closely, the election results mark a powerful statement: Washington’s attorneys remain wary of any perceived political entanglements, even from well-connected names like Brad Bondi.",Brad Bondi loses bid to lead DC Bar Association.

"From red flags to American flags: Trump keeps Tesla, Musk keeps quiet; 'big, beautiful' feud over?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/from-red-flags-to-american-flags-trump-keeps-tesla-musk-keeps-quiet-big-beautiful-feud-over/articleshow/121740338.cms,"Elon Musk and Donald Trump (R)





Just days after calling for US President Donald Trump ’s impeachment, Elon Musk is now softening his stance, offering indirect praise and patriotic emojis for the administration, in a dramatic shift after what had been dubbed the “big, beautiful breakup” between the two giants.The rapid shift in tone comes after a public and messy split between the tech mogul and the US president.Last week, Musk’s social media posts took direct aim at Trump, accusing him, without evidence, of appearing in documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and demanding his removal from office. But by the weekend, many of those posts had vanished.As clashes between demonstrators and Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers escalated in LA, Musk threw his weight behind the administration’s firm stance on immigration enforcement.He reposted Vice President JD Vance’s message that the “president will not tolerate rioting and violence,” adding a string of American flags.Musk has long voiced support for closed borders and stricter immigration controls, positions closely aligned with Trump’s own policies.Tech billionaire also amplified a post from Trump on Truth Social demanding apologies from California governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass over the chaos in the city.“They should apologize to the people of Los Angeles,” Trump wrote, as images of burning cars and violent confrontations flooded social media.In a gesture that signals a possible thaw in tensions, President Trump announced Monday that he would not sell the Tesla he purchased from Elon Musk—despite their recent public fallout. The car, acquired during friendlier times as a symbolic move to promote American-made electric vehicles, was reportedly intended for White House use rather than personal driving.Following the clash between the two, there had been speculation that Trump might sell or give away the vehicle. However, the President clarified he had no plans to part with it.“I could move it around,” Trump said, “but I won’t sell the car.”He also confirmed he had no intention of cutting ties with Musk’s Starlink satellite service, further suggesting that a complete break between the two may not be in the cards.In another surprising turn, Musk re-followed White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, one of the architects of the administration’s immigration policy -- after unfollowing him during last week’s feud.The move stirred speculation, especially given that Miller’s wife, Katie Miller, recently left her White House post to work with Musk full-time. The Millers had been regulars at Musk’s social gatherings, and their proximity to both camps has made them the subject of White House gossip amid the falling out.Katie Miller declined to comment.Musk also moved to quash viral rumours that had fanned the flames of the feud. When his AI chatbot Grok seemingly confirmed a fake post showing Musk telling Miller “Just like I took your wife,” Musk replied, “No, it’s fake ffs I never posted this.”Despite the apparent thaw, Musk has not fully abandoned criticism. Over the weekend, he took more subtle jabs at the president’s sweeping domestic policy proposal, nicknamed the “One, Big, Beautiful Bill”—which recently passed the House and is now under Senate review.Wall Street, however, seems to be welcoming the détente. Tesla’s stock rebounded 4.6% on Monday, though it remains below levels seen before last week’s dramatic fallout.“While we do not expect Trump and Musk to be back to their Mar-a-Lago connected at the hip days, it would not be a surprise to see Trump and Musk slowly mend the fences (with the help of intermediaries behind closed doors) over the coming months,” wrote WedBush analyst Dan Ives. “At the end of the day Trump needs Musk to stay close to the Republican party and Musk needs Trump for many reasons including a green light on a federal framework for autonomous [vehicles]. ”On Monday afternoon, Trump himself struck a more conciliatory tone when asked about Musk.“We had a good relationship, I wish him well, very well,” the president told reporters at the White House.But when asked if he would answer Musk’s call, Trump paused: “I haven’t really thought about it actually. I would imagine he wants to speak to me, I would think so.”","Elon Musk is softening his stance on US President Donald Trump.

After days of sharp exchanges and rising tensions between US President Donald Trump and world's richest man, Elon Musk , signs of de-escalation are beginning to emerge. On Monday, Trump appeared to strike a conciliatory tone when asked whether he would speak with Musk soon.At a White House press conference, a reporter asked: ""Do you plan to speak to Elon Musk on the phone any time soon?""Trump replied: ""Umm... I haven’t really thought about it actually. I would imagine he wants to speak to me. If I were him, I would want to speak to me. Maybe he’s already called. You’d have to ask him. Ask him if he’s already called. But I’d have no problems with it.""He also added ""We had a good relationship and I just wish him well, very well actually.""The remarks follow a high-profile fallout between the two powerful figures. Musk, once a key informal adviser to the Trump administration, publicly broke ranks last week over the president’s sweeping domestic legislation, branded the Big, Beautiful Bill, which Musk harshly criticised.Musk not only accused Trump of lying but also claimed, without evidence, that the president’s name appeared in documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein He suggested the administration was withholding those records.The clash intensified when Musk floated the idea of launching a new political movement called ""the American Party"", prompting Trump to warn that he would act if Musk funded Democratic candidates.However, within a day, tensions began to cool. Musk deleted several inflammatory posts, including the one tying Trump to Epstein. He also reposted a statement from Trump about the Los Angeles immigration protests, adding American flag emojis, a gesture seen by many as an olive branch.Despite their public dispute, Trump made it clear he is not closing the door on future dialogue. His remark that he wouldn’t be surprised if Musk had already reached out signals a possible reopening of communication between the two former allies.","Trump appeared to strike a conciliatory tone when asked whether he would speak with Musk soon.

Two people were shot dead late on Sunday near the Bellagio fountains on the Las Vegas Strip.Police believe it was a targeted attack following a social media dispute, reports the New York Times.The suspected gunman was identified as 41-year-old Manuel Ruiz, who turned himself in at a police station in nearby Henderson on Monday. According to the Las Vegas Metropolitan police department, Ruiz is expected to be charged with two counts of murder with a deadly weapon.Undersheriff Andrew Walsh told reporters at a press briefing that the victims and suspect ""knew each other and had previously engaged in conflict over social media prior to the shooting."" He added that the feud had taken place across ""a variety of social media platforms.""The shooting occurred around 10:40 pm local time on Las Vegas Boulevard, close to the Bellagio Resort & Casino. Police officers who were patrolling the area at the time heard gunshots and rushed to the scene, where they found two individuals on the sidewalk with gunshot wounds. They were pronounced dead at the scene by medical personnel.Footage of the incident, shared widely online and verified by Storyful, shows a man looking into the camera as crowds move along the pavement behind him. A second man wearing a cap and sunglasses is then seen firing a weapon while a woman attempts to intervene. Around seven gunshots are audible in the video, as bystanders flee or drop to the ground in panic.Police described the shooting as an “isolated incident” and said it was not a random act of violence. ""It is believed that the suspect and the victims knew each other,"" the police said in a statement.As of Monday morning, court records did not list an attorney for Ruiz, and the Clark County Public Defender's Office said it was unclear whether he had legal representation.","Two people were shot dead late on Sunday near the Bellagio fountains on the Las Vegas Strip.

Frederick Forsyth Death: 10 remarkable facts about the master storyteller—that seem fake,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/frederick-forsyth-death-10-remarkable-facts-about-the-master-storytellerthat-seem-fake/articleshow/121740328.cms,"1. He Rewired the Modern Thriller into a Machine

9. He Predicted Putin’s Rise in Icon



10. He Had a Dalliance With an Eastern Bloc Spy







When Frederick Forsyth passed on to Elysium on June 9, 2025, at the age of 86, it marked the end of a literary era that fused storytelling with surveillance, narrative with national security. His novels didn’t just entertain—they instructed. They didn’t merely imagine what could go wrong in the corridors of power—they reverse-engineered how it might happen, step by meticulous step.Forsyth’s life was as compelling as his fiction: a Royal Air Force pilot, a war reporter censored by the BBC, an MI6 asset, and a bestselling novelist whose understanding of realpolitik was sharp enough to worry governments. He wrote thrillers, yes—but thrillers with classified undertones.Here are ten remarkable facts about the man who turned geopolitics into gripping fiction and fiction into geopolitical insight.Before Forsyth, spy thrillers were either romanticised (James Bond) or psychological (George Smiley). He introduced a third way: technical, procedural, and deeply embedded in the machinery of statecraft. His prose was efficient, his plots logical to the point of inevitability, and his characters often secondary to the operation itself.In his novels, tension came from the detail: the timing of a train, the forging of a passport, the exact dimensions of a rifle part hidden in a suitcase. Plot was king. Emotion, a luxury.Forsyth joined the Royal Air Force at 19 and flew de Havilland Vampire jets during his national service in the 1950s. At one point, he was the youngest pilot in the RAF. This early training in discipline, focus, and logistics would later become the framework for his fiction.His novels are structured like flight plans: precise, pre-checked, and unflinching in their execution.As the BBC’s Africa correspondent during the Nigerian Civil War, Forsyth was horrified by what he saw in Biafra: starvation, massacres, and a humanitarian crisis unfolding in slow motion. But the BBC, under government pressure, censored his dispatches.Disgusted, he resigned. He later published The Biafra Story in 1969—a brutally honest account that accused the British state of complicity in war crimes. That break with institutional media shaped his career. Fiction, he realised, could sometimes speak where journalism was gagged.In 1970, unemployed and living in a modest flat, Forsyth decided to fictionalise a failed real-life plot to kill French President Charles de Gaulle. He wrote The Day of the Jackal in just over a month, relying on research, precision, and instinct.The book had no named protagonist, no dramatic arc, and a known outcome. Still, it became a bestseller, selling over 10 million copies, winning awards, and becoming a film. It also became required reading for intelligence trainees, thanks to its detailed depiction of clandestine operations.To write The Dogs of War, Forsyth orchestrated a fictional coup in a fictional African country. He recruited real mercenaries, mapped out logistics, arranged weapons shipments, and led them to believe they were about to topple a real regime.Only at the last moment did he reveal the operation was fake—a research exercise for a novel. The mercenaries were furious. The book, meanwhile, became a classic. It exposed how corporations could exploit post-colonial instability to stage regime change.Forsyth confirmed in 2015 what had long been rumoured: that he had worked as an informal asset for MI6 for more than twenty years. His global travel, his journalist’s cover, and his instinct for detail made him a valuable cut-out.He wasn’t a spy in the cinematic sense. He didn’t kill, carry arms, or steal secrets. He observed. He reported. He blended in. And, occasionally, he wrote fiction that came uncomfortably close to fact.During the late 1980s, Forsyth travelled frequently to Southern Africa, particularly Rhodesia and apartheid-era South Africa. It has been reported—though never officially confirmed—that he acted as an intermediary in backchannel discussions about nuclear disarmament.According to sources close to British intelligence, Forsyth offered informal counsel to South African officials on the logistics and diplomatic value of dismantling their nuclear arsenal. In 1989, South Africa began the process, becoming the first nation in history to voluntarily give up nuclear weapons.Forsyth never used ghostwriters or research assistants. He wrote every sentence himself—often in longhand. His bibliography spans more than 20 books, translated into 30 languages and read by presidents, spymasters, and soldiers.From The Odessa File to The Fist of God, his novels exposed war crimes, arms trafficking, the drug trade, and terrorist financing. Several prompted concern from Western governments due to their alarming accuracy.In 1996, Forsyth published Icon, a novel set in a post-Soviet Russia teetering on collapse. The villain is Igor Komarov, a former KGB officer turned populist nationalist who conceals a secret manifesto outlining his plan to restore authoritarian rule.Three years later, Vladimir Putin took power. The novel, once considered far-fetched, now reads like prophecy. Forsyth didn’t just write thrillers—he extrapolated trends. He saw Russia’s future before most analysts did.In his 2015 memoir The Outsider, Forsyth admitted to a brief romance in his youth with a woman later revealed to be an agent for the Czech secret police. He described it as a lapse in judgement, though he learned quickly how intelligence agencies use relationships to extract information.Like many of his protagonists, Forsyth learned his lessons the hard way—and wrote them down for others to read.The Final DispatchFrederick Forsyth didn’t just redefine the thriller. He redefined the relationship between writer and truth. His stories were thrilling because they were possible. His villains were terrifying because they were plausible. His style was cool, exact, unsentimental—yet layered with meaning for those willing to pay attention.He believed that good fiction could explain bad politics. That well-constructed lies could reveal hidden truths. And that sometimes, a novelist was more useful to a nation than a dozen diplomats.He is gone now. But his books remain—quiet, exact, and dangerous in the best possible way.","Frederick Forsyth passed on to Elysium on June 9, 2025, at the age of 86.

'Clean sweep needed': RFK Jr fires vaccine advisory board; AMA calls move 'undermining trust',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/clean-sweep-needed-rfk-jr-fires-vaccine-advisory-board-ama-calls-move-undermining-trust/articleshow/121737863.cms,"

What is the ACIP?







Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced on Monday that he had dismissed all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the key scientific group advising the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on vaccine use. Kennedy said he would replace them with his own nominees and planned to convene the new committee in just two weeks in Atlanta.The decision sparked sharp criticism from major medical organisations. The American Medical Association (AMA) described the move as undermining trust and disrupting a transparent process that has saved countless lives. Dr. Bruce A. Scott, AMA president, warned that Kennedy’s action, coupled with falling vaccination rates, could lead to an increase in vaccine-preventable diseases.Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, called the mass dismissal ""a coup"" and said it was “not how democracies work.” He added the decision raised concerns about whether the new committee members would be seen as impartial, and accused Kennedy of breaking his promise not to remove the existing panel.Kennedy, a former anti-vaccine activist turned health secretary, justified the sweeping change in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece.He claimed that many committee members had conflicts of interest and argued that the overhaul was necessary to restore public confidence in vaccine science. He wrote: “A clean sweep is needed to re-establish public confidence in vaccine science.” However, an NPR investigation found that the government report Kennedy cited to support his conflict of interest claims showed no such issues.The ACIP is a crucial advisory body that sets national vaccine policy, including schedules for routine immunisations for children and adults. Its members are independent experts who base their recommendations on thorough scientific review. The CDC director then approves these recommendations for official use.Kennedy also noted that without removing the current members, the previous Trump administration would not have been able to appoint a majority of new members until 2028. The Biden administration had installed the entire current panel, though ACIP is traditionally a non-partisan group.This shake-up follows other controversial actions by Kennedy since taking office. These include changing COVID-19 vaccine recommendations without consulting the committee and cancelling vaccine research programmes aimed at future pandemics. The ACIP’s webpage listing members was removed shortly after the announcement.Despite Kennedy’s assurance that new members would prioritise “public health and evidence-based medicine” and no longer serve as “a rubber stamp for industry profit-taking agendas,” public health experts remain deeply concerned about the impact of this overhaul on vaccine policy and public trust.",Health Secretary Robert F.

Los Angeles protests: Why are Waymo robotaxis being torched?

Waymos caught in the chaos

Not just about immigration

Robotaxis: Vulnerable in unrest

Fire risks and health concerns





Several Waymo self-driving taxis were vandalised and set alight during tense protests in Los Angeles following a wave of immigration raids.While the demonstrations were not specifically aimed at Waymo, the Alphabet-owned robotaxis became targets amid growing anger towards law enforcement, surveillance, and perceived inequality driven by Big Tech.At least five Waymo vehicles, all Jaguar I-PACE electric SUVs, were destroyed during protests over the weekend. Thick plumes of smoke billowed over downtown LA after demonstrators smashed windows, spray-painted anti-ICE slogans, and set the driverless cars on fire. Some protesters reportedly threw electric scooters into the burning shells, while others ripped off car doors or used skateboards and improvised flamethrowers to damage the vehicles.The scenes unfolded on Los Angeles Street between Arcadia and Alameda around 5 pm on Sunday. According to CNN and the Los Angeles Times, the vehicles were found lined up and were soon overwhelmed by a crowd angry over the Trump administration’s decision to send in the National Guard, a move California governor Gavin Newsom opposed.Waymo insists the protests were not directly related to its operations. However, critics argue that the robotaxis represent more than just technology.They say the cars, equipped with dozens of cameras, function as roving surveillance devices and may pose a threat to protester anonymity.“Safety is our highest priority,” Waymo spokesperson Ethan Teicher said in a statement. “We removed vehicles from Downtown Los Angeles and will not be serving that specific area for the time being, out of an abundance of caution and with guidance from LAPD.”A spokesperson told USA Today that the company is still operational across most of Los Angeles but has paused services in certain areas where protests have intensified.Waymo’s driverless vehicles, unlike human-operated taxis, lack the ability to judge and flee dangerous situations. Their programmed behaviour makes them passive targets during public unrest. They do not attempt to evade crowds or protest zones. This vulnerability, combined with their high-tech appearance, has made them stand out.The company’s rapid expansion has also drawn criticism. In January, Waymo said it had completed 1.9 million miles in LA alone. While the cars are popular with many users, some residents feel they were never consulted about having driverless technology tested in their neighbourhoods.The destruction of electric vehicles raised significant safety issues. The Los Angeles Fire Department responded to the blazes, and the LAPD warned that burning lithium-ion batteries release toxic gases, such as hydrogen fluoride, which pose risks to both emergency responders and bystanders.Electric vehicle fires are harder to extinguish. Unlike petrol-fuelled cars, EV batteries do not need oxygen to burn. Firefighters instead have to cool the battery using large volumes of water, often through special nozzles that spray directly beneath the vehicle.","At least five Waymo vehicles, all Jaguar I-PACE electric SUVs, were destroyed during protests over the weekend.

What he's done to that state is like what Biden's done to this country.""The comment followed a weekend of rising tensions after Trump deployed thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles without the state’s consent.On Monday, Trump returned to the White House from Camp David and addressed the media on the South Lawn, where he appeared to endorse former immigration official Tom Homan’s recent remarks about possibly arresting Newsom. “I would do it if I were Tom. I think it's great,” Trump told reporters.Newsom quickly hit back, sharing a video of Trump’s comment on Instagram and calling it a turning point for the country. “The President of the United States just called for the arrest of a sitting Governor,” he wrote. “This is a day I hoped I would never see in America. I don't care if you're a Democrat or a Republican, this is a line we cannot cross as a nation – this is an unmistakable step toward authoritarianism.”On X, he added, “These are the acts of a dictator, not a President. ”Homan, speaking on Fox News, clarified that there had been “no discussion” about arresting Newsom or Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass, although he had previously said that “no one’s above the law.” He stressed that criminal acts, such as interfering with federal officers or damaging property, would be prosecuted by the Trump administration.Speaker of the House Mike Johnson voiced his support for Trump’s remarks and deployment of federal troops. “We have to maintain the rule of law, and if the state and local leaders are unable or unwilling to do so, it is the job of the federal government to step in,” Johnson said.Despite his past assertion that governors must request National Guard deployments, Trump has changed his stance, claiming the situation in California justified federal action. “The biggest change from that statement is we have an incompetent governor,” he told reporters.Shortly after Trump’s comments, officials confirmed that 700 Marines from Twentynine Palms had been ordered into Los Angeles. Their specific role has yet to be outlined.Furthermore, the Pentagon confirmed that Trump announced the deployment of 2,000 more National Guard troops to Los Angeles.Newsom said the state was suing the Trump administration over what he described as the illegal federalisation of the National Guard. “The order he signed doesn't just apply to CA. It will allow him to go into ANY STATE and do the same thing,” Newsom said.","US President suggests California governor Gavin Newsom should be arrested.

"Trump authorises additional 2,000 National Guard members to Los Angeles, US officials say",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-authorises-additional-2000-national-guard-members-to-los-angeles-us-officials-say/articleshow/121742602.cms,"AP image





Another 2,000 National Guard troops along with 700 Marines are headed to Los Angeles on orders Monday from President Donald Trump, escalating a military presence local officials and Gov Gavin Newsom don't want and the police chief says creates logistical challenges for safely handling protests.An initial 2,000 guard troops ordered by Trump started arriving Sunday, which saw the most violence during three days of protests driven by anger over Trump's stepped-up enforcement of immigration laws that critics say are breaking apart migrant families.Monday's demonstrations were was far less raucous, with thousands peacefully attending a rally at City Hall and hundreds protesting outside a federal complex that includes a detention centre where some immigrants are being held following workplace raids across the city.Trump has described Los Angeles in dire terms that Mayor Karen Bass and Newsom say are nowhere close to the truth. They say he is putting public safety at risk by adding military personnel even though police say they don't need the help.Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell said in a statement he was confident in the police department's ability to handle large-scale demonstrations and that the Marines' arrival without coordinating with the police department presented a ""significant logistical and operational challenge"" for them.Newsom called the deployments reckless and ""disrespectful to our troops"" in a post on the social platform X.""This isn't about public safety,"" Newsom said. ""It's about stroking a dangerous President's ego.""The protests began Friday in downtown Los Angeles after federal immigration authorities arrested more than 40 people across the city. The smell of smoke hung in the air downtown Monday, one day after crowds blocked a major freeway and set self-driving cars on fire as police responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and flash-bang grenades.US officials said the Marine troops were deployed to protect federal property and personnel, including federal immigration agents. Trump's Monday order put the national guard members on active duty.One U.S. official warned that the order was just signed and it could take a day or two to get troops moving. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss troop movements.Despite their presence, there has been limited engagement so far between the Guard and protesters while local law enforcement implements crowd control.California pushes back against presence of federal troopsCalifornia Attorney General Rob Bonta filed a lawsuit over the use of national guard troops following the first deployment, telling reporters in his announcement Monday that Trump had ""trampled"" the state's sovereignty.""We don't take lightly to the president abusing his authority and unlawfully mobilising California national guard troops,"" Bonta said. He sought a court order declaring Trump's use of the Guard unlawful and asking for a restraining order to halt the deployment.Trump said Monday that the city would have been ""completely obliterated"" if he had not deployed the Guard.Bass criticised the deployment of National Guard troops and Marines as a ""deliberate attempt"" by the Trump administration to ""create disorder and chaos in our city.""She made a plea to the federal government: ""Stop the raids.""Early protests remained peacefulOn Monday, thousands flooded the streets around City Hall for a union rally ahead of a hearing for arrested labor leader David Huerta, who was freed a few hours later on a $50,000 bond. Huerta's arrest on Friday while protesting immigration raids has become a rallying cry for people angry over the administration's crackdown. He is the president of the Service Employees International Union California, which represents thousands of the state's janitors, security officers and other workers.Early protests had a calm and even joyful atmosphere at times, with people dancing to live music and buoyed by Huerta's release.Protesters linked hands outside the downtown federal detention centre where Huerta was being held in front of a line of police officers. Religious leaders joined the protesters, working with organisers at times to de-escalate moments of tension.There was a heavy law enforcement presence in the few square blocks including the federal detention facility, while most in the immense city of some 4 million people went about their normal business on peaceful streets.Chanting against a line of national guard troops with Homeland Security officers behind them surrounding the federal buildings ramped up in the afternoon as people yelled, ""Free them all!"" and ""National guard go away.""As the crowd thinned in the evening, police began pushing protesters away from the area, firing crowd-control munitions as people chanted, ""Peaceful protest.""Other protests took shape Monday afternoon across LA County. Outside a Los Angeles clothing warehouse, relatives of detained workers demanded at a news conference that their loved ones be released.The family of Jacob Vasquez, 35, who was detained Friday at the warehouse, where he worked, said they had yet to receive any information about him.""Jacob is a family man and the sole breadwinner of his household,"" Vasquez's brother, Gabriel, told the crowd. He asked that his last name not be used, fearing being targeted by authorities.Several dozen people were arrested in protests throughout the weekend. Authorities say one was detained Sunday for throwing a Molotov cocktail at police and another for ramming a motorcycle into a line of officers.McDonnell said police officers were ""overwhelmed"" by the remaining protesters, who included regular agitators who show up at demonstrations to cause trouble. He said the protests followed a similar pattern for episodes of civil unrest, with things usually ramping up in the second and third days.Guard deployment is a nearly unprecedented escalationThe deployment appeared to be the first time in decades that a state's national guard was activated without a request from its governor, a significant escalation against those who have sought to hinder the administration's mass deportation efforts.The last time the national guard was activated without a governor's permission was in 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson sent troops to protect a civil rights march in Alabama, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.In a directive Saturday, Trump invoked a legal provision allowing him to deploy federal service members when there is ""a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the government of the United States.""","President Donald Trump orders 2,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines to Los Angeles.

Chinese student held for smuggling 'biomaterial'; wiped device before landing; third arrest in a week,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/chinese-student-held-for-smuggling-biomaterial-wiped-device-before-landing-third-arrest-in-a-week/articleshow/121739062.cms,"Had erased her electronic device just days prior: Kash Patel





A Chinese national has been arrested at Detroit Metropolitan Airport for allegedly smuggling biological material into the United States, marking the second such incident in recent days. Chengxuan Han, a Ph.D. student at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, was taken into custody by the FBI after arriving on a flight from China.According to federal authorities, Han had shipped four packages from China to individuals associated with a laboratory at the University of Michigan. The contents reportedly included biological material related to roundworms, which require a permit to import under U.S. regulations. Some of the shipments were intercepted by authorities last year and earlier this year, with one concealed inside a book.Speaking on the arrest, FBI director Kash Patel, posted on X: “Yesterday, @FBIDetroit arrested a second Chinese national on charges of smuggling biological materials into the US and lying to federal agents. This individual is Chengxuan Han, a citizen of the People’s Republic of China and a Ph.D.student in Wuhan, China. Han is the third PRC connected individual charged on similar allegations in recent days.”Patel added: “Upon arriving at the Detroit Metropolitan Airport on June 8, Han allegedly made false statements to federal officials regarding the packages she had previously mailed — and had erased her electronic device just days prior. In a follow-up interview with FBI and ICE HSI agents, Han admitted to sending the packages and lying about their contents. This case is part of a broader effort from the FBI and our federal partners to heavily crack down on similar pathogen smuggling operations, as the CCP works relentlessly to undermine America’s research institutions. ”The FBI’s court filing did not suggest that the material posed an immediate threat, though U.S. Attorney Jerome Gorgon Jr. said the smuggling “threatens our security.” John Nowak from US Customs and Border Protection said, “The guidelines for importing biological materials into the U.S. for research purposes are stringent, but clear, and actions like this undermine the legitimate work of other visiting scholars. ”Biologist Michael Shapira of UC Berkeley, who reviewed the court documents, said, “It doesn’t strike me as something that is dangerous in any way. But there are rules to ship biological material.”This follows the recent charges against two other Chinese researchers, Yunqing Jian and Zunyong Liu, who allegedly attempted to smuggle Fusarium graminearum, a dangerous plant fungus described by authorities as a potential “agroterrorism weapon,” into the U.S. Jian was working at the University of Michigan at the time.","Chengxuan Han, a Ph.D. student at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, was taken into custody by the FBI after arriving on a flight from China.

PESHAWAR: A gas cylinder explosion killed six people and injured two others in Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Saturday, according to an official.The incident, which occurred in the Mardan district's Aram Colony, caused the collapse of a two-storey house, said Bilal Ahmad Faizi, spokesperson for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Rescue 1122, an emergency rescue service.""Six people were killed and two girls were seriously injured in the accident,"" Faizi said.Rescue teams reached the site soon after receiving information about the explosion and recovered the bodies while rescuing the injured trapped under the rubble, he said.Mardan Deputy Commissioner Azmatullah Wazir, District Emergency Officer Syed Shoaib Mansoor and Assistant Commissioner Junaid Khalid were present at the scene and supervised the entire operation, he added.The operation was completed in seven hours, including the recovery of the dead and transfer of the injured to a hospital.Incidents of fire caused by leakage and explosion of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinders occur routinely across the country.Following an LPG tanker explosion in Punjab province's Multan that killed at least 19 and injured over a dozen others earlier this year, the Senate Standing Committee on Cabinet Secretariat ordered a probe into the sale of adulterated LPG.In February, 12 people were injured after a gas cylinder exploded in a roadside cafe near the Khyber Teaching Hospital (KTH) in Peshawar, a rescue official said.","A gas cylinder explosion killed six people and injured two others in Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif has urged the US to broker a ""comprehensive dialogue"" between India and Pakistan. Addressing an event at the US embassy in Islamabad on Wednesday, Sharif lauded US President Donald Trump for what he said was his role in defusing a four-day military clash last month that was triggered by the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that claimed 26 lives. India has rejected all claims of a US role in bringing about a cessation of hostilities.Sharif's praise for Trump as a leader ""against escalation and war"" was mirrored by Pakistan Peoples Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari in Washington. Bilawal credited Trump's diplomacy for the ceasefire and suggested that US mediation could facilitate broader talks. ""If America can help sustain this ceasefire, its role in arranging a comprehensive dialogue would benefit both nations,"" he said. This appeal to Trump's deal-making persona has sparked suspicion in India, where analysts see it as Pakistan's attempt to shift focus from its alleged role in cross-border terrorism and regain diplomatic leverage.Sharif's call for dialogue signals willingness to engage but raises questions about Pakistan's commitment to India's concerns, especially after dismissing the Simla Agreement and seeking US involvement.","Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif has urged the US to broker a ""comprehensive dialogue"" between India and Pakistan.

"Over 200,000 Afghans forced to leave Pakistan amid intensified deportation drive; Iran ramps up expulsions too",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/over-200000-afghans-forced-to-leave-pakistan-amid-intensified-deportation-drive-iran-ramps-up-expulsions-too/articleshow/121626249.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: ANI)





More than 200,000 Afghans have left Pakistan since April as Islamabad ramped up its deportation campaign targeting undocumented migrants, with Iran also increasing expulsions, raising concerns over Afghanistan’s capacity to manage the influx.According to Pakistan’s ministry of interior, over 135,000 Afghans left the country in April, followed by 67,000 in May, and more than 3,000 in just the first two days of June. The repatriation drive, which began in November 2023, has now seen over one million Afghans return from Pakistan, reported news agency ANI, citing ARY News.The deportation campaign is aimed at more than 800,000 Afghans whose residency documents have been revoked. Among them are individuals born or raised in Pakistan. Islamabad has accused Afghan nationals of links to terrorism and blamed Kabul for harbouring militants, a charge the Taliban authorities have repeatedly denied.Farmer Mohammad Wali, who crossed into Afghanistan via the southern Spin Boldak border, was quoted by AFP as saying, “We left behind our orchards... but we said to ourselves, ‘If we stay, maybe one day we’ll lose our dignity.’”With Eid al-Adha approaching, the pace of returns has slightly slowed, though crossings continue daily.Iran, meanwhile, is pushing ahead with similar measures. The UN's International Organisation for Migration (IOM) recorded 15,675 Afghan deportations from Iran in May, more than double the figure in April.The IOM expressed alarm at the increasing number of families, rather than single men, being sent back, calling this “a new and concerning trend.”In late May, Iranian authorities ordered undocumented Afghans to leave by July 6—a move that could impact as many as four million people, according to AFP. Already, more than 450,000 Afghans have returned from Iran since January.Both nations host millions of Afghan refugees who fled decades of conflict.But as economic conditions worsen and political tensions rise, public support for Afghan migrants has diminished. Pakistan, which still hosts around three million Afghans, has also warned it may revoke the UNHCR-issued refugee cards of 1.3 million cardholders by the end of June.The IOM has repeatedly urged countries to “immediately suspend the forced return of Afghans... until safe, voluntary, and dignified return conditions are in place.”The Taliban authorities, who remain internationally unrecognised, have echoed the call, asking for returns to occur in a “dignified” manner.Analysts view the deportation moves, particularly by Pakistan, as politically driven. Islamabad is under pressure to address domestic security threats, especially in border regions plagued by insurgencies.However, rights groups and humanitarian agencies warn that Afghanistan’s already fragile infrastructure is ill-equipped to absorb such a massive and sudden return of people.","More than 200,000 Afghans have left Pakistan since April as Islamabad ramped up its deportation campaign targeting undocumented migrants.
