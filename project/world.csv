"After losing its last inhabitant, Tamil Nadu ghost village stands as example of perils of climate change",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/after-losing-its-last-inhabitant-tamil-nadu-ghost-village-stands-as-example-of-the-perils-of-climate-change/articleshow/110543651.cms,"MADURAI: When 73-year-old Kandasamy Naicker breathed his last Sunday in Meenakshipuram , it was the last breath of his village in Tuticorin district of Tamil Nadu . Naicker, the lone inhabitant, was a poignant symbol of a community once thriving, now a ghost village.Meenakshipuram in Sekkarakudi panchayat had 1,296 residents according to the 2001 census. Yet, the relentless grip of environmental changes, inconsistent rainfall, and enduring droughts gradually eroded the village's lifeblood, leading to a mass exodus over the past decade. Fields once fertile turned barren, pushing families to seek stability elsewhere.Amidst this exodus, Naicker clung to Meenakshipuram, outliving his wife by 20 years and continuing to reside in the village where he was born. He is survived by two sons and two daughters.Younger son Bala Krishnan reflected on Meenakshipuram's transformation. ""The village was highly dependent on farming,"" he recounted. ""The situation began to deteriorate due to the lack of rainfall and water shortage . People had to walk 3-4km to get water and other basic facilities, which made them disinterested in staying in the village.""Naicker's last wish was to die in the village. Up until his final months, he managed his daily chores, cooking his own meals. Only recently did Krishnan arrange for someone to assist his father. Living in Kasilangapuram, 15km away, Krishnan would often bring food for his father, or Naicker would travel to his son's home.After Sunday's sundown, the man who checked on Naicker found him lifeless. ""Even though my father was a farmer, he was well-known for participating in rekla and jallikattu (bull races),"" Krishnan said.Sekkarakudi panchayat president I Ramalakshmi spoke with a heavy heart: ""There are six villages within the panchayat's limits. Now, officially we have lost a village due to the exodus that occurred over the past decade."" She noted that while the groundwater table has improved and roads have been laid in recent years, the spectre of the past struggles looms large. ""No one is ready to come and settle in the village.""As Meenakshipuram fades into memory, it stands as a poignant reminder of the challenges faced by many similar villages in the region. Its abandonment underscores the harsh realities of environmental change and the inexorable forces that shape the world.","Kandasamy Naicker, 73, was a poignant symbol of a community once thriving, now a ghost village.

HYDERABAD: Telangana is set to get a new emblem soon, with chief minister A Revanth Reddy on Wednesday reportedly giving artist Rudra Rajesham a set of guidelines. The new emblem will replace the one adopted by the BRS govt on June 2, 2014.

The Reddy regime has already changed the abbreviation for Telangana from TS, used by the previous govt, to TG in official documents.

Reddy and his deputy are also said to have finalised a state song : 'Jaya Jayahe Telangana', penned by Ande Sri with music scored by Oscar winner MM Keeravani .

Bharat Rashtra Samithihas objected to the new emblem, while some musicians have said it would be a mistake to ask Andhra-born Keeravani to set the score for the state song.

JAMMU: BSF troops shot down a suspected Pakistani drone flying close to the LoC in J&K's Poonch district late Tuesday, making this the second such instance along the international border in less than three weeks.

Official sources said the border guards fired several rounds after suspected drone activity was reported from across the LoC in Khanetar garrison. BSF cordoned off the area immediately and a search operation was launched to sanitize the area as the troops suspected the drone could have dropped arms and ammunition.

On May 10, BSF troops opened fire at a Pakistani drone near the international border in J&K's Samba district, forcing the flying object to retreat to the Pakistani side.

On February 29, Samba SSP Vinay Kumar and BSF IG (Jammu frontier) D K Boora presented Bhagwan Dass, a civilian, with a cheque for Rs 3 Lakh and a cash prize of Rs 50,000 for alerting security forces about a drone flying over his fields in January.

US Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito rejects Democrats’ calls to step away from Trump cases,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-supreme-court-justice-samuel-alito-rejects-democrats-calls-to-step-away-from-trump-cases/articleshow/110548804.cms,"US Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito told lawmakers he won’t recuse from cases involving Donald Trump and the January 6 Capitol riot after revelations that flags associated with far-right causes flew over his homes in Virginia and New Jersey.Responding to Democratic calls that he disqualify himself, Alito said in two letters that his wife, Martha-Ann Alito , was responsible for flying the flags.“My wife is an independently minded private citizen,” he wrote. “She makes her own decisions, and I honor her right to do so.”The court is set to decide by the end of June whether Trump is immune from criminal charges that he illegally tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election. In a second case that could have implications for the Trump prosecution, the justices are also weighing an appeal by a man charged with being part of the Capitol assault.The New York Times reported that an upside-down American flag was displayed at Alito’s Virginia house in the days before President Joe Biden’s inauguration. More recently, an “Appeal to Heaven” flag flew at Alito’s beach residence in New Jersey, the Times said. Similar flags were carried by January 6 rioters.“My wife is fond of flying flags. I am not,” Alito wrote to Democratic lawmakers including Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois and Representative Hank Johnson of Georgia. “She was solely responsible for having flagpoles put up at our residence and our vacation home and has flown a wide variety of flags over the years.”Alito said his wife flew the upside-down flag during a “very nasty neighborhood dispute” during which a house displayed a sign personally attacking her and a man directed a vile epithet at her. He said he asked Martha-Ann Alito to take down the flag as soon as he saw it, “but for several days, she refused.”He said he presumed his wife was expressing a patriotic and religious message with the “Appeal to Heaven” flag and that neither Alito was aware of any connection to the “Stop the Steal Movement.”Johnson, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary subcommittee that oversees federal courts, said Alito’s response underscored the need for Congress to impose an enforceable code of conduct on the Supreme Court. The code adopted by the Supreme Court in November doesn’t include any enforcement mechanism.“Any unbiased and reasonable person would find laughable Justice Alito’s ‘the dog ate my homework, and I didn’t even know I had homework’ defense,” Johnson said in an emailed statement.Alito, 74, is one of the anchors of the conservative wing that controls the Supreme Court. Two years ago, he wrote the court’s opinion overturing the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling and eliminating the constitutional right to abortion.",US Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito told lawmakers he won’t recuse from cases involving Donald Trump and the January 6 Capitol riot.

Violence clouds the last day of campaigning for Mexico's election,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/violence-clouds-the-last-day-of-campaigning-for-mexicos-election/articleshow/110548139.cms,"MEXICO CITY: Mexico held the last day of campaigning Wednesday before Sunday's nationwide election, but the closing rallies were darkened by attacks on candidates and the country's persistently high homicide rate.Opposition candidate Xochitl Galvez started her last campaign rallies early Wednesday on the outskirts of Mexico City, and she focused her ire on President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador 's ""hugs not bullets"" policy of not confronting the drug cartels .Galvez is facing the candidate of Lopez Obrador's Morena party , former Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum. Sheinbaum, who leads in the race, has promised to continue all of Lopez Obrador's policies.""Are we going to continue with hugs, or are we going to apply the law to criminals?"" Galvez asked a cheering crowd. ""Mexico wants peace, wants tranquility.""Lopez Obrador has withdrawn funding for police forces and directed it to the quasi-military National Guard, which critics say lacks the professional and investigative abilities needed to fight the drug gangs. Galvez promised to return the funding to police forces and guarantee them wages of at least $1,200 per month.Galvez also pledged to reconcile a country that has been highly polarized by the outgoing president's rhetoric, saying ""enough division, enough hatred ... we are all Mexicans.""Sheinbaum held her final rally later Wednesday in Mexico City's vast, colonial-era central square. She delivered a strongly nationalistic speech to a large crowd.""Mexico is respected in the world, it is a reference point,"" Sheinbaum said, claiming that Lopez Obrador's government ""has returned to us the pride of being Mexicans.""""Mexico has changed, and for the better,"" she said.On the violence issue, Sheinbaum vowed to continue Lopez Obrador's policy of offering apprenticeships to encourage youths not to join drug cartels.""We will deepen the strategy of peace and security, and the progress that has been made,"" she said. ""This is not an iron fist"" policy, Sheinbaum said. ""This is justice.""While Lopez Obrador has increased the country's minimum wage and increased government benefit programs, he has been unable to significantly reduce the historically high homicide rate, which currently runs at more than 30,000 killings per year nationwide. That gang-fueled violence has also cast a shadow over the campaigns.A mayoral candidate in the western state of Jalisco was shot multiple times by intruders in his campaign offices late Tuesday. Two members of Gilberto Palomar's campaign staff were also wounded, and all three were hospitalized in serious condition, according to Jalisco state security coordinator Sanchez Beruben.Mexicans will vote Sunday in an election weighing gender, democracy and populism, as they chart the country's path forward in voting shadowed by cartel violence. With two women leading the contest, Mexico will likely elect its first female president. More than 20,000 congressional and local positions are up for grabs, according to the National Electoral Institute.Gunmen killed an alternate mayoral candidate in Morelos state, just south of Mexico City on Tuesday, state prosecutors said.Local media reported attackers on a motorcycle shot Ricardo Arizmendi five times in the head in the city of Cuautla in Morelos. Alternate candidates take office if the winner of a race is incapacitated or resigns.About 27 candidates, mostly running for mayor or town councils, have been killed so far this year. While that is not much higher than in some past elections, what is unprecedented is the mass shootings: candidates used to be killed in targeted attacks, but now criminals have taken to spraying whole campaign events with gunfire.","Mexicans will vote Sunday in an election weighing gender, democracy and populism.

""The lava has already conquered (a lot).""Workers and anyone still in town were ordered to leave earlier in the day, police said.At one point, a dark plume of ash boiled up over the crater from an explosive interaction of magma hitting groundwater, scientists said.The cloud did not rise high enough to initially pose any threat to aviation, but scientists were closely monitoring the situation, Johanna Malen Skuladottir, of the Met Office, told RUV.Grindavik, which is about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Iceland's capital, Reykjavik, has been threatened since a swarm of earthquakes in November forced an evacuation in advance of the initial Dec. 18 eruption. A subsequent eruption overwhelmed some defensive walls and consumed several buildings.The area is part of the Svartsengi volcanic system that was dormant for nearly 800 years before reawakening.The volcano erupted again in February and March. The Feb. 8 eruption engulfed a pipeline, cutting off heat and hot water to thousands of people.Iceland, which sits above a volcanic hot spot in the North Atlantic, sees regular eruptions and is experienced at dealing with them. The most disruptive in recent times was the 2010 eruption of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano, which spewed huge clouds of ash into the atmosphere and led to widespread airspace closures over Europe.","Lava shoots 50 meters into the sky from a fissure that grew to 3.5 kilometers (2.1 miles) in length.

More than 1 million homes and businesses were without electricity across Texas at one point, but by Wednesday afternoon, the lights had come back on for about 70% of those customers.Houston was flooded and damaged just weeks after a storm walloped the area, killing eight people. The 16-year-old worker was killed northeast of the city, in the suburb of Magnolia. He was a construction company employee, the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office said.A 6-year-old boy and two others who were shocked by the downed power line at a campground north of Houston were in critical condition, authorities said.Witnesses saw a 59-year-old man touch the line Tuesday, but investigators were trying to determine how the two others were shocked, Montgomery County Fire Marshal Jimmy Williams said Wednesday.A couple driving during the storm in the Houston suburb of Spring missed a turn and then spotted a pickup truck submerged in a culvert.Ashley Renee Young said her boyfriend, Robert Chance, grabbed a sledgehammer from his toolbox, broke the back window and pulled out the driver, who only suffered minor cuts from broken glass. They then bought the man a shirt from a nearby gas station before driving him home.""I think we have lifelong friends now,"" Young said.The potential for heavy rains, localized flash flooding and severe weather continued Wednesday through Oklahoma and Texas. Thunderstorms were predicted late Wednesday and Thursday across eastern Montana and Wyoming and northeast Colorado before pushing into Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma and northern Texas.Tuesday's power outages in the Dallas area prompted officials to extend voting by two hours in the state's runoff elections after dozens of polling places lost electricity amid 80 mph winds (129 kph) that caused extensive damage.Social media posts showed winds pushing an unoccupied American Airlines plane away from a gate at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. No one was injured, but the airport said about 500 flights were canceled because of the weather.The National Weather Service said the ""very active and highly impactful"" weather pattern will continue in the central US over the next several days.Destructive storms over the Memorial Day weekend killed 24 people in seven states across the South, the deaths stretching from Texas to Virginia.","More than 1 million homes and businesses were without electricity across Texas at one point.

UK parliament dissolved ahead of general election,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-parliament-dissolved-ahead-of-general-election/articleshow/110546979.cms,"The British parliament was dissolved on Thursday, as the five-week campaign period begun leading up to the general election on July 4.The election is expected to bring the Labour party back to power after 14 years of Conservative rule. As the clock struck one minute past midnight, all 650 seats of members of parliament (MPs) became vacant, marking the official commencement of the electoral process.Prime Minister Rishi Sunak 's election announcement, which took place amidst a heavy downpour, has been seen by many as a shaky start to the campaign, with some interpreting the rain as an ill omen.Sunak's decision to hold the election on July 4, earlier than anticipated, is viewed as an attempt to regain momentum as his party's popularity wanes in opinion polls. Meanwhile, the Labour party, led by former human rights lawyer Keir Starmer, is poised to capitalize on the opportunity to regain power after 14 years in opposition.The ruling Conservative party is not only trailing significantly behind Labour in the polls but also facing a mass exodus of parliamentarians. An unprecedented 129 MPs, including 77 Conservatives, have announced their decision not to seek re-election, reflecting the bleak prospects of victory for the governing party. Some Tory MPs have expressed frustration at being caught off guard by the July election date, with Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Steve Baker opting to continue his vacation in Greece while preparing his campaign remotely.Despite Sunak's efforts to promote the Conservatives as the ""safe"" option during his campaign travels across the country, his campaign has encountered some early setbacks. A visit to the site where the Titanic was built drew comparisons between his leadership and captaining a sinking ship. Sunak's campaign has focused on appealing to older voters and right-wing supporters, with pledges to bring back national service and a substantial tax break for pensioners. However, these efforts have done little to boost the party's favor, with polls indicating a significant lead for Labour.Labour, on the other hand, is aiming to capitalize on the public's fatigue with the Conservatives, who have seen five prime ministers since 2016, along with numerous scandals and economic challenges. The party has sought to position itself as the ""natural party of business,"" garnering the support of 120 industry leaders this week. Under the leadership of Keir Starmer, Labour has shifted towards the center in an attempt to win back voters, including by expelling former leader Jeremy Corbyn and taking steps to address anti-Semitism within the party.However, the past week has also exposed long-standing factional divisions within Labour, with MP Diane Abbott expressing dismay at the party's desire to bar her from candidacy. Starmer has faced criticism from leftist voters who accuse him of backtracking on promises made during his successful leadership campaign. As the campaign progresses, both parties will need to navigate internal challenges while presenting a compelling vision to the electorate.(With AFP inputs)","The British parliament was dissolved on Thursday, as the five-week campaign period begun leading up to the general election on July 4.

What would an ICC arrest mean for Israel's Netanyahu?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/what-would-an-icc-arrest-mean-for-israels-netanyahu/articleshow/110519943.cms,"The International Criminal Court could soon issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu along with his defense minister and three Hamas leaders. If it does, what are the potential consequences?The government in Tel Aviv has cast a cautious eye toward The Hague, Netherlands, home of the International Criminal Court (ICC).The court's chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, has requested arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. They are accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip.Khan also requested arrest warrants for three Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Ismael Haniyeh — on similar charges related to the Islamist militant group's October 7 attacks on Israel What type of criminal case could the ICC bring against Netanyahu? The International Criminal Court only investigates individuals and only becomes active when a person is suspected of being responsible for one of four core crimes: genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, or starting a war of aggression.The ICC has in fact been looking into possible war crimes committed by Israel since 2021. At the same time, the court has also been investigating similar accusations leveled against Hamas fighters. Moreover, investigations are currently ongoing in regard to acts of violence committed by Israeli settlers in the West Bank. Recent developments in the war between Israel and Hamas are all being considered in that context.This most recent conflict began when militant Islamist Hamas fighters attacked southern Israel on October 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and abducting more than 240 back to Gaza. Hamas is considered a terrorist organization by numerous Western nations, including many EU member states as well as the US.According to the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry, Israel's military response to the attack has killed more than 34,000 people, though these numbers cannot be independently verified. When does the ICC have jurisdiction over Israeli citizens?As a rule, the ICC may only take action when states cannot or will not pursue charges for the above-mentioned crimes at the national level. The current war makes it even more unlikely than usual that Israeli courts would initiate criminal proceedings against the head of its government, its ministers or army leadership. Furthermore, either a perpetrator's home country must also acknowledge the court. Israel does not or the country in which a crime is alleged to have taken place must.That could well be the case here, as the Palestinian territories are signatories to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Joining Israel in their rejection of the ICC are the US, China, Russia, India, almost all Arab states, and Iran.When none of the nations tied to the crimes are ICC Treaty signatories, then the task of contracting the ICC to investigate falls to the United Nations Security Council as was the case, for instance, with Libya and Sudan. What consequences could the ICC warrant have for Netanyahu?An arrest warrant is not a conviction. In the first instance it is a sign that the ICC takes accusations leveled against an individual seriously enough to investigate them.According to the ICC website, judges will issue a warrant of arrest if it appears necessary to ensure that the person will actually appear at trial, that he or she will not obstruct or endanger the investigation or the court's proceedings, or to prevent the person from continuing to commit crimes. However, as the ICC has no police force to arrest individuals against whom it has issued warrants, it is highly unlikely that members of the Israeli government will ever appear before judges in The Hague.Still, an arrest warrant would greatly limit the freedom of movement that Netanyahu and his associates enjoy, for each of the ICC treaty's 124 signatories are obliged to arrest individuals with outstanding warrants and to hand them over to the court.That is why Russian President Vladimir Putin has been forced to avoid traveling to most international meetings since the ICC issued a warrant for his arrest over accusations that he is involved in the systematic abduction of Ukrainian children. Putin only travels directly to and from nations that do not recognize the legitimacy of the ICC. How would such an arrest warrant be tied to accusations of genocide leveled at Israel?The ICC's investigation should not be confused with another similar case pending against the state of Israel, namely the charge of genocide leveled against it by several nations. Among others, South Africa has spearheaded a case before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) based on the high number of casualties in Gaza.The ICJ is also based in The Hague, but does not investigate individuals nor does it issue arrest warrants, instead dealing exclusively with legal disputes between states. In late January, the ICJ said it recognized the ""risk of genocide in the Gaza Strip.Still, the ICJ refused to back an emergency motion filed by South Africa demanding Israel immediately cease all military operations in the enclave. As a result of that stance, the genocide case against Israel could potentially drag on for months or even years.","The International Criminal Court could soon issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu along with his defense minister and three Hamas leaders.

Israel's Rafah operation not a major offensive: US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israels-rafah-operation-not-a-major-offensive-us/articleshow/110516106.cms,"WASHINGTON: The White House on Tuesday provided the most complete definition yet of what it considers a ""major ground operation "" in Rafah that could trigger a change in United States policy toward Israel, and said Israel's actions there have not yet reached that level.""We have not seen them smash into Rafah - we have not seen them go in with large units, large numbers of troops in columns and formations in some sort of coordinated maneuver against multiple targets on the ground. That is a major ground operation. We have not seen that,"" White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters at a briefing.Israel's three-week-old Rafah offensive stirred renewed outrage and prompted an outcry from global leaders after an airstike on Sunday that Gaza officials said killed at least 45 people when a blaze ignited in a tent camp in a western district.The Biden administration has repeatedly warned Israel against launching a large-scale military offensive in Rafah, a city in southern Gaza packed with refugees who followed Israel's previous orders to evacuate there. President Joe Biden himself publicly warned Israel this month that the U.S. would stop supplying it with weapons if Israeli forces conduct a major invasion there without a credible plan to protect civilians.Israel told around one million Palestinian civilians displaced by the almost eight-month-old war to evacuate to Al-Mawasi when it launched its incursion in Rafah in early May. Around that many have fled Rafah since then, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA reported on Tuesday.Asked about reports that Israeli forces have moved into central Rafah, Kirby said ""my understanding is, and I believe the Israelis have spoken to this, that they are moving along something called the Philadelphia corridor, which is on the outskirts of the town, not in the town proper.""""We have not seen a major ground operation and these tanks are moving along a corridor that they have told us previously that they would use on the outskirts of the town to try to put pressure on Hamas,"" Kirby said.The World Court last week ordered Israel to immediately halt its military assault on Rafah, in a landmark emergency ruling in South Africa's case accusing Israel of genocide.Israel said it had targeted two senior Hamas operatives in a compound and had not intended to cause civilian casualties.""I don't know how anybody could dispute that they were trying to go after Hamas in a targeted precise way,"" Kirby said, adding that the U.S. would wait for the results of Israel's investigation into the incident.The U.S. is by far the biggest supplier of weapons to Israel, and it accelerated deliveries after the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attacks.Rafah was a major entry point for humanitarian relief before Israel stepped up its military offensive on the Gaza side of the border earlier this month and seized control of the crossing from the Palestinian side.More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, Gaza's health ministry says. Israel launched its air and ground war after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.",The Biden administration has repeatedly warned Israel against launching a large- scale military offensive in Rafah.

Could US-Saudi 'mega deal' spark Middle East nuclear race?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/could-us-saudi-mega-deal-spark-middle-east-nuclear-race/articleshow/110524194.cms,"Saudi Arabia 'cannot be trusted'

What does Israel have to do with it now?

US outbidding China?

One part of a predicted, closer US-Saudi relationship is particularly controversial. Experts fear Saudi Arabia may use a civilian nuclear energy program, which the US will help with, to develop their own atomic bombs.Last week, several media reports suggested that Saudi Arabia was on the verge of a ""mega deal"" with the United States. Bombastic phrases like a ""mega deal"" or a ""grand bargain"" are being used because the agreement would bring the US and the Saudis closer in significant ways, including in a mutual defense pact and through cooperation on emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and a civilian nuclear program . Such a deal was originally supposed to be closely tied to the normalization of Saudi Arabia's relations with Israel. However, with the Saudis insistent that any normalization include Israeli recognition of a path towards Palestinian statehood and the Israelis equally insistent that they don't want that, normalization has been put on hold. Instead, according to various reports published by the likes of Reuters, The New York Times, the UK's Financial Times and The Guardian since the start of May, the ""mega deal"" between Saudi Arabia and the US is likely still going ahead — just without Israel. The exact details are not known, but any deal is likely to involve cooperation on Saudi Arabia's long-held ambitions for civilian nuclear energy, a way for the country to diversify away from oil. Many analysts say this is among the most likely-to-happen aspects of a ""mega deal"" — and also among the most controversial.The controversy stems from the fact that the Saudis are determined to enrich uranium on their own soil, Kelsey Davenport, director for nonproliferation policy at the Arms Control Association in Washington, told DW. The technology used for uranium enrichment produces fuel for civilian nuclear reactors but can also result in uranium suitable for nuclear weapons. ""Saudi Arabia is adamant on [this],"" Kelsey said. ""Riyadh will walk away from a nuclear cooperation agreement with Washington before it forgoes enrichment."" Last September, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman created international headlines when he said if Iran, his country's regional rival, manages to get a nuclear bomb, then Saudi Arabia will need one, too.As reports about a US-Saudi deal started coming out in early May, US Senator Edward Markey wrote to President Joe Biden. ""I fear that Saudi Arabia — a nation with a terrible human rights record — cannot be trusted to use its civil nuclear energy program solely for peaceful purposes and will instead enrich uranium and seek to develop nuclear weapons,"" argued Markey, co-chair of his government's nuclear weapons and arms control working group. Besides fears that the Saudis might end up with nuclear bombs, there are also concerns that simply permitting them to enrich uranium would set off a regional race. ""Allowing Saudi Arabia to acquire such capabilities could set a problematic precedent at the international level. It could possibly encourage other countries in the region, such as Egypt or Turkey, to pursue similar nuclear capabilities, leading to a proliferation cascade in an already volatile Middle East,"" Manuel Herrera, a researcher focused on nuclear non-proliferation at Istituto Affari Internazionali, an Italian thinktank, wrote late last year. Herrera and other experts hope that if a Saudi civilian nuclear program happens, the US government will enforce strict guardrails. These might include deferring uranium enrichment inside Saudi Arabia until later or setting up an enrichment facility that only American citizens can access. It could also include allowing a Saudi-based conversion plant to turn refined uranium powder into gas, but not enriching uranium. The Saudis could also be asked to adhere to conditions, including signing on to specific non-proliferation criteria under Section 123 of the US 1954 Atomic Energy Act and agreeing to additional inspections by the Austria-based International Atomic Energy Agency. ""As far as we know, the US is trying to put forward a deal very similar to the one that they did with the United Arab Emirates in 2009, in which they applied Section 123,"" Herrera explained to DW in an interview earlier this week. However, the Saudis have previously said no to that.""The assumption has been that the various elements [of a US-Saudi agreement] would be mutually reinforcing,"" Robert Einhorn, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Brookings Institute, wrote in an April briefing. ""For example, normalization would make nuclear cooperation with [Saudi Arabia] more palatable to Israel, and a US security guarantee and nuclear cooperation would make normalization more palatable to [Saudi Arabia]."" But now that Israel is not involved, analysts say the ""mega deal"" may be another way to pressure the Israeli government. Israel's allies, including the US, have been pushing Israeli leaders towards a different, more careful approach in Gaza. The Israeli government has previously said it doesn't want the Saudis to get any kind of uranium enrichment capacities.However, there are also other equally significant motives for US-Saudi nuclear cooperation. As Davenport of the Arms Control Association pointed out, Saudi Arabia's interest in nuclear energy predates the ""push for a broader Israeli-Saudi normalization."" ""And there are also some other countries who have been putting offers on the table,"" Herrera told DW, referring to China.If a US-Saudi nuclear deal goes ahead, this would sideline any Chinese influence in this area. From a commercial perspective, it would also result in healthy contracts for US companies. The recent progress on a US-Saudi deal also has a lot to do with upcoming US elections, Davenport argued. ""The Biden administration wants an agreement before the presidential election."" Other experts have suggested that closer cooperation between Saudi Arabia and the US may also mean the Americans have more influence over Saudi Arabian decisions on oil prices. The US government would obviously prefer these to stay lower in the run-up to elections. But could a deal still end up causing a nuclear race of some kind in the Middle East? ""There is a risk … if you give one actor access to this technology, then the race will be on,"" Herrera agreed. But he thinks that, with sufficient guardrails and monitoring in place, risks could be minimized. Davenport is not as sure. ""It's not inevitable that there will be a proliferation cascade in the region, but Saudi enrichment does make it more likely."" And all that is heightened ""by the disintegration of great power unity on preventing proliferation and the stress facing the broader nuclear order,"" she concluded, referring to increasing threats to use nuclear weapons, such as in Ukraine, or to launch them into outer space.","Reports suggest Saudi Arabia is on the verge of a ""mega deal"" with the United States.

His unopposed at the party’s general council meeting came on a day that was declared a public holiday by his younger brother, PM Shehbaz Sharif , to commemorate the 26anniversary of Pakistan’ nuclear tests , conducted during Nawaz Sharif’s second term as PM.Pakistan conducted the tests on May 28, 1998, almost three weeks after India tested its devices, in Chaghi hills of southwestern Balochistan province, making it the seventh nuclear nation in the world and the first Muslim state to have a nuclear arsenal.While Nawaz was at peak of his popularity in May 1998, he could not celebrate the first anniversary of the nuclear tests following his ouster from office in Oct 1998 by General Pervez Musharraf in a military coup.The anniversary is being commemorated for the first time in 26 years, coinciding with his re-election as PML-N president . He took the party’s reins back from Shehbaz, who had stepped down on May 13, paving the way for the 74-year-old party founder, to be elected again.Shehbaz hailed Nawaz, who returned to Pakistan in Oct 2023 after a four-year self-imposed exile in UK, for the nuclear tests, which he said ensured “credible minimum deterrence”. In a post on X, he said: “On this historic day in 1998, then-PM Nawaz Sharif demonstrated bold leadership by rejecting nerve-wracking pressures and inducements to make Pakistan a nuclear-armed nation.” He also paid tribute to ex-prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who, he said, was the founder of Pakistan’s nuclear programme, for his “strategic foresight and unwavering commitment to the cause”.Shehbaz was elected PML-N president in March 2018, months after the Supreme Court disqualified Nawaz for life in the Panama Papers case.

The Dawn newspaper reported that the General Council meeting is set to take place at a local hotel. It is likely that the 74-year-old veteran politician, who returned to Pakistan in October last year after a four-year self-imposed exile in the UK, will be elected unopposed even though as many as 11 party members have received the nomination papers for the top post, the report said.The PML-N had earlier announced convening the general council meeting on May 11 but it was postponed to coincide with the celebration of 26 years of Pakistan becoming a nuclear power, the report said.PML-N Punjab president Rana Sanaullah, while addressing a press conference, hinted that the elder Sharif would be elected without a contest.Responding to a question if others were contesting against the former premier, Sanaullah said if any party member wanted to contest against him, they should come forward.When asked why the party didn't adopt a democratic process to vote for a new president, Sanaullah said the party was a ""servant of power corridors and it was Nawaz Sharif who made it a party of the public"". He added that after Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, it was Nawaz Sharif who ""made the party vibrant"".Replying to another question on why Nawaz Sharif wasn't active in politics after the February 8 general elections, Sanaullah said the former PM is not angry with anyone and he is active in the party. ""All major decisions of the party and government are taken by him,"" he added.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had earlier this month resigned as the PML-N president citing the ""unjust"" disqualification of the party supremo and his elder brother Nawaz Sharif from the PM Office.Shehbaz, 72, said that it was time for the latter to ""resume his rightful place as the president of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz party.""The February 8 general elections had delivered a fractured mandate and the PML-N did not get a clear majority. It joined hands with the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) led by Bilawal Zardari Bhutto and other smaller parties to form the government at the federal level when Nawaz relinquished the post of prime minister in favour of Shehbaz.Much before that, in 2017, Nawaz had stepped down as the country's prime minister after the Supreme Court disqualified him for life from holding public office for not declaring a receivable salary.Following his trial in the Panama Papers case, the apex court, in February 2018, disqualified the PML-N supremo as the party's president.",Nawaz Sharif is set to be re-elected as the President of the ruling PML-N party.
