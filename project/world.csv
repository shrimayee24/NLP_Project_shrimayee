A career cut short by family tragedy

NEW DELHI: In a shocking twist to the death of former Karnataka DGP Om Prakash, Bengaluru Police have detained his wife, Pallavi, after she allegedly threw chilli powder in his face and stabbed him to death in their HSR Layout residence.Their daughter, Kriti, has also been detained for questioning as investigators dig deeper into what appears to be a domestic dispute turned deadly.The development comes following a formal complaint filed by the deceased officer’s son, who alleged that both women had a role in the killing.According to police sources, the 68-year-old retired IPS officer was killed following a heated argument with Pallavi, who reportedly lost control and attacked him with a knife after blinding him with chilli powder, reported PTI.The murder is said to have occurred on the ground floor of their three-storeyed home on Sunday, where Prakash was found lying in a pool of blood.What makes the case more chilling is what followed: PTI sources say Pallavi made a video call to a friend immediately after the incident and declared, “I have killed the monster.”Prakash's son Kartikesh has come forward with a damning accusation that his mother Pallavi had been threatening to kill his father for a week, and that his sister Kriti pressured him to return home just two days before his death.“Due to these threats, my father had gone to stay at his sister’s house,” Kartikesh said in his police complaint. “My younger sister Kriti went there and brought him back against his will.”According to the complaint, the fatal incident came to light around 5 pm on Sunday when a neighbor alerted Kartikesh while he was at the Karnataka Golf Association. “I rushed home and found police and others already there. My father was lying in a pool of blood with injuries on his head and body. A broken bottle and a knife were found near his body,” he said, adding that his father was taken to St John’s Hospital.“My mother Pallavi and sister Kriti used to fight with my father often. I strongly suspect they are involved in his murder,” he added, urging police to take legal action.Investigators believe the murder was the result of long-standing tensions in the family, including a property dispute over land in Dandeli, Karnataka. Sources said the couple had frequent confrontations, and Pallavi had even visited the HSR Layout police station months ago to file a complaint. When her grievance wasn't taken seriously, she allegedly staged a dharna outside the police station.Pallavi is also reportedly undergoing treatment for schizophrenia and has been on medication, police sources revealed.Om Prakash, a 1981-batch IPS officer from Champaran, Bihar, had an illustrious career in the Karnataka police force. He held a Master’s degree in Geology and rose through the ranks to serve as Director General and Inspector General of Police from March 1, 2015, until his retirement in March 2017.He began his service in Ballari district as Additional Superintendent of Police and held key roles in Shivamogga, Uttara Kannada, Chikkamagaluru, the Lokayukta, and the Fire and Emergency Services.The case has sparked massive interest in Karnataka and beyond, with police sources earlier confirming the use of a weapon and visible signs of physical assault. An autopsy report is awaited, and further investigation is underway.","Former Karnataka DGP Om Prakash, 68, was found dead in his home on Sunday.

He was convicted two weeks ago.Although Bidre-Gore's body parts were never found, a Panvel sessions court held that their absence was not an ""absolute ground to exonerate the offenders"". It, however, said the case also did not fall in the rarest of rare category to warrant death penalty, as sought by the prosecution.Additional sessions judge K G Paldewar also came down heavily on Navi Mumbai police for not taking prompt action and said the entire police machinery stood behind Kurundkar. It directed the police chief to initiate action against two officers over probe lapses.Two aides-driver Kundan Bhandari and friend Mahesh Phalnikar -who were convicted for helping Kurundkar dispose of the body were given 7 years in prison each.The court held that the time spent by Kurundkar, who was arrested in Dec 2017, as well as of Bhandari and Phalnikar since their arrest in Feb 2018 will be set off against their sentences.The judge said police officers Anil Survase and Kondiram Popere's lapses in investigation were ""intentional omission"" and should not be ""exonerated"". Bidre-Gore's brother had filed a missing person complaint in July 2016, but an FIR was lodged only in Jan 2017 and Kurundkar arrested that Dec. ""It is painful that a lady police officer was brutally murdered and her torso and parts of body were in a creek. Despite that, police did not step into action to take cognisance of this crime promptly though sufficient evidence was before them,"" the court said.Holding that circumstantial evidence in the case was sufficient, the judge noted that it was established that Kurundkar wanted to get rid of Bidre-Gore, with whom he was having an extramarital affair , as she was repeatedly demanding that he marry her. ""Thus, the homicidal death as well as the motive of the crime are established. The circumstances against the accused pointing towards his guilt are sufficient to establish the offence of murder even in the absence of the dead body."" The prosecution had said Kurundkar had killed Bidre-Gore with the help of three others at his house in Bhayander, chopped her body into pieces, kept the parts in a refrigerator, and threw them into the Bhayander creek.Defence lawyer Vishal Bhanushali said an appeal against Kurundkar's sentence will be filed in Bombay HC. Special public prosecutor Pradip Gharat said the state may file an appeal against the time spent in jail being counted as part of Kurundkar's sentence. Bidre-Gore's husband Raju Gore said he will approach the high court to demand a probe by an independent agency against the police officers who allegedly shielded Kurundkar.Kurundkar had received the President's medal for meritorious service on Republic Day in 2017, months after the crime. While convicting him on April 5, court questioned how he had cleared the screening process for the award despite being under scrutiny.It had earlier acquitted the fourth accused in the case, Dnyandeo alias Raju Patil , the nephew of former cabinet minister Eknath Khadse, for lack of evidence.(With inputs from agencies)","Abhay Kurundkar (52) was on Monday sentenced to life imprisonment for murdering assistant police inspector Ashwini Bidre-Gore, chopping up her body and disposing of it in 2016.

The NGO alleged that the same comedian had even attempted to ridicule a visually challenged person.It also drew the court's attention to a widely circulated video on social media in which former cricketers Yuvraj Singh, Harbhajan Singh and Suresh Raina were seen limping and holding their backs to depict the impact of cricketing careers on their bodies.""Unfortunately, the aforesaid video clips are only a drop in the bucket and there are numerous other instances where the media platforms have treated persons with disabilities (and their issues) as objects of derision, pity, or public entertainment. It is humbly submitted that free speech does not entail within its scope the liberty to speak loosely on such serious issues and sliding such statements off as humour or satire,"" it said. The bench asked the senior counsel to prepare a list of such videos being circulated on social media, along with transcripts, and file it in the court along with her suggestions for further course of action.Meanwhile, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for both Maharashtra and Assam where Allahbadia is facing investigation on FIRs lodged for his crass comments on parental sex, informed the court that while Maharashtra Police have completed probe and are ready to file chargesheet, Assam Police are awaiting questioning of one of the co-accused.The bench posted the matter to be heard on April 28 to consider Allahbadia's request for release of his passport as his counsel Abhinav Chandrachud said it was part of his livelihood to enable him travel abroad and fix interviews for his shows.",Supreme Court took adverse note of comedian Samay Raina ridiculing the exorbitant treatment cost of people suffering from spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh asked an NGO to list incidents of vacuous comments along with transcripts for consideration of appropriate action.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120498538,imgsize-932848,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

This is the situation because of the heavy rainfall yesterday. We have to go on foot. We started travelling at 6 am. We parked our cars behind and now we will walk the rest of the way. We still have around 7-8 km more to walk. We would bring the bride the same way, as the roads are not cleared. We request the government to clear NH 44 as soon as possible...,"" says Mashkoor, the groom who is on his way to his wedding on foot as the roads are blocked after landslides.Mashkoor further mentioned that they plan to bring the bride back by the same route, as the roads remain uncleared.The groom urged the government to clear NH 44 at the earliest possible opportunity.Road clearing activities are in progress on National Highway 44 in Ramban district of Jammu and Kashmir.In the early hours of Sunday, intense rainfall caused by cloudbursts led to flash floods and landslides in Jammu and Kashmir's Ramban district.The vital 250-kilometre Jammu-Srinagar National Highway, which serves as the sole all-weather connection between Kashmir and the rest of India, was rendered impassable. Numerous vehicles were stranded as debris from mountainsides blocked approximately twelve locations along the route between Nashri and Banihal.Due to persistent severe weather conditions and predictions, Kashmir valley schools will suspend all classwork on Monday, April 21, announced Sakina Itoo, the education minister of Jammu and Kashmir (J-K).The announcement follows ongoing heavy rainfall, cloudbursts and landslides affecting various regions of Jammu and Kashmir, particularly in mountainous areas.The Srinagar Meteorological Centre has issued a yellow alert or 'watch' for the majority of districts, with the exception of Jammu, Poonch, Kathua, Muzzafarabad and Mirpur.","The Jammu-Srinagar National Highway (NH 44) was shut down after heavy rainfall.

Harvard University announced on Monday it has filed a lawsuit to stop the administration of US President Donald Trump from blocking its federal funding of more than $2.2 billion.The funding freeze is ""unlawful"" and ""beyond the government's authority,"" the university said in a statement on its X handle.""Moments ago, we filed a lawsuit to halt the funding freeze because it is unlawful and beyond the government’s authority,"" the statement quoted Harvard University president Alan Garber as saying.Harvard University has filed its lawsuit in a Massachusetts federal court, and named several other universities targeted by the US president.""This case involves the government's efforts to use the withholding of federal funding as leverage to gain control of academic decision making at Harvard. The government's actions flout not just the First Amendment, but also federal laws and regulations,"" according to the lawsuit.Earlier, Harvard president Garber said, ""No government, regardless of which party is in power, should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.""This was in response to the federal government's list of demands which Harvard would have to ""satisfy"" to continue receiving federal funds.Trump and his White House team have publicly justified their campaign against Harvard and other universities as a ""reaction"" to what they say is ""uncontrolled anti-Semitism"" on campuses, and the need to ""reverse"" diversity programmes aimed at addressing ""historical oppression of minorities.""The administration claims that anti-Israel protests, which swept across US college campuses last year, were ""rife with anti-Semitism.""Universities, including Harvard, had cracked down on the protests over the allegations at the time, with the Cambridge-based institute placing 23 students on probation and denying degrees to 12 others, according to protest organizers.Other institutions, including Columbia, have bowed to less far-ranging demands from the Trump administration, which claims that the educational elite is ""too left-wing.""","Harvard University has filed a lawsuit to stop the administration of US President Donald Trump from blocking its federal funding of more than $2.2 billion.

Soon after the desecration of a Gurdwara in Vancouver, British Columbia, the Lakshmi Narayan Mandir in Surrey was defaced with pro-Khalistan graffiti , marking another alarming incident targeting religious institutions in Canada.Images shared online showed the temple walls sprayed with pro-Khalistan slogans, drawing widespread condemnation from community leaders and elected officials. Indian-origin Canadian Member of Parliament Chandra Arya strongly condemned the act, calling it “yet another chilling reminder of the growing influence of Khalistani extremism .”“The attacks on Hindu temples that began several years ago continue unabated today, this latest graffiti on the Hindu temple is yet another chilling reminder of the growing influence of Khalistani extremism,” Arya posted on social media platform X. “Well-organized, well-funded, and backed by significant political clout, Khalistani elements are brazenly asserting their dominance and successfully silencing Hindu voices across Canada.”The incident in Surrey followed the vandalism of the Ross Street Gurdwara, operated by the Khalsa Diwan Society in Vancouver, where walls were defaced with slogans like “Khalistan Zindabad” and graffiti containing the word “murdabad.” The slogans reportedly included threats aimed at Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Vancouver Police Department confirmed an investigation is underway.“This Khalistani extremists have targeted Khalsa Diwan Society (Ross Street Gurdwara) in Vancouver with pro-Khalistan graffiti and intimidation tactics,” Arya added. “In a statement issued after the desecration, KDS said that a small group of Sikh separatists, advocating for Khalistan, defaced our sacred walls with divisive slogans like ‘Khalistan Zindabad’.”The Khalsa Diwan Society condemned the act, calling it part of “an ongoing campaign by extremist forces that seek to instill fear and division within the Canadian Sikh community.”“We call on all Canadians, Sikhs, and people of goodwill to stand together in the face of this extremism,” the Society said. “We must denounce these acts and reaffirm our shared commitment to the values of peace, unity, and respect. This attack is an attack on all of us — on the very unity that makes Canada strong.”Calling for unity, Arya urged Hindu and Sikh communities in Canada to “rise with urgency and demand immediate, decisive action from authorities at all levels of government.”“Silence is no longer an option,” he said.Canada has seen a rise in religious vandalism in recent years. Earlier this year, the Sri Krishna Brundavana Temple in the Greater Toronto Area was targeted. In 2023, PM Modi had condemned the defacement of a temple in Brampton, saying, “I strongly condemn the deliberate attack on a Hindu temple in Canada. Equally appalling are the cowardly attempts to intimidate our diplomats. Such acts of violence will never weaken India’s resolve. We expect the Canadian government to ensure justice and uphold the rule of law.”","Lakshmi Narayan Mandir in Surrey was defaced with pro-Khalistan graffiti.

All the mistimed homeruns in 2024

The morning of April 21, 2025, brought with it grave news for the world: the Pope is dead. Pope Francis departed the world, and while people are grieving the loss, baseball fans are betting all over social media. What are they betting on? Well, baseball fans are speculating about another home run from Philadelphia Phillies’ right fielder, Nick Castellanos, who is apparently the king of hitting homers during bad timing. The reason behind this is Castellanos’s long history of mistimed home runs, which has become the talk of the baseball town. Here’s a timeline of all mistimed home runs that the player has made from 2020.The saga of mistimed home run started in 2020, when Nick went for a home run during the Phillies vs Kansas City Royals. During the match, broadcaster, Thom Brennaman, was apologizing on-air for the homophobic slang he used recently.During the apology, Castellanos hit a home run for which Thom had to pause, give an update on the home run, and then return to his apology. The awkward timing went viral all over social media.The second strike happened in 2021, when the Royals’ broadcaster was eulogizing a World War II veteran, who died a few days back, at the age of 97. During the eulogy, Castellanos went for a home run, and the broadcaster had to chime in,During the Spring Training of 2022, Nick again had his bad-timing moment. The broadcaster was discussing coach Pete Walker’s recent DUI arrest when Castellanos went for a single. The player again had his moment during Memorial Day, when broadcaster Tom McCarthy was paying tribute to the fallen members.In the middle of the tribute, Nick went for a home run, and Tom had to pause his tribute mid-way.said McCarthy to keep up with the game.It seems the curse of bad-timing home runs is not just limited to memorable events and broadcasters. Nick had apparently hit a home run in 2023 when broadcaster Brian Anderson was sending good wishes to Charlie Manuel, the Phillies manager who recently had a stroke.The year 2024 seems to be the one when Nick had the most mistimed home runs. He hit a homer when Willie Mays, legendary Giants player departed the world, one when former US President Donald Trump was shot in the ear, and again when Joe Biden said he won’t be standing for re-election. Nick even had a home run on the 23rd anniversary of the tragic 9/11 incident.Apparently, Nick had his career first home run when he was in the Minors on the same day when Osama Bin Laden was declared dead. Well, it seems like the curse has been with the right fielder long back.But, the real question is, will Nick hit another home run in the next Phillies game? Now that the news of Pope Francis's demise is all over the news, will Nick’s poorly-timed homer curse return? Only time will tell.Also Read: Phillies’ star Bryce Harper’s wife Kayla captures heartwarming moment as son Krew celebrates dad’s homer","Nick Castellanos hit his first home run on the day Osama Bin Laden was declared dead.

MELBOURNE: Australians began voting Tuesday at general elections as campaigning was overshadowed by the death of Pope Francis. Polling stations opened to voters who for a variety of reasons will be unable to vote on May 3. Around half the votes are expected to be cast before the election date.Both Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and opposition leader Peter Dutton cancelled campaign events planned for Tuesday out of respect for the late pontiff.Flags were flown at half staff from government buildings across the country where a 2021 census found 20% of the population were Catholics.Albanese was raised as a Catholic but chose to be sworn in as prime minister when he was elected in 2022 by making a secular affirmation rather than by taking an oath on a Bible.Albanese attended a Mass in honour of the pope in Melbourne's St. Patrick's Cathedral on Tuesday morning.""I try not to talk about my faith in public,"" Albanese told reporters.""At times like this, I think what people do is they draw on who they are and certainly my Catholicism is just a part of me,"" he added.Albanese and Dutton, who leads the conservative Liberal Party, will meet in Sydney later Tuesday for the third televised leaders' debate of the campaign.A fourth debate is planned Sunday.Dutton, who was raised by a Catholic father and Protestant mother and attended an Anglican school, planned to go to a church service in Sydney.""I don't think it's a day for overt politicking at all. I think that the day is best spent reflecting,"" Dutton told Australian Broadcasting Corp.""I don't think there's a place for the body blows of politics today.

"Signalgate 2.0: After Hegseth’s leaked Signal chat, watchdog files suit to preserve Trump officials’ messages",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/signalgate-2-0-after-hegseths-leaked-signal-chat-watchdog-files-suit-to-preserve-trump-officials-messages/articleshow/120501809.cms,"A nonprofit watchdog group, American Oversight, expanded a lawsuit on Monday aimed at several senior national security officials in the Trump administration, requesting a federal judge to mandate the preservation of all messages sent via the encrypted communications app Signal.The lawsuit was filed in US District Court in Washington, DC, and focuses on messages related to official business that have been sent using Signal, an app with an auto-delete feature and no apparent record-keeping system for federal records.The amended lawsuit follows a New York Times report revealing that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared details about military strikes in Yemen on March 15 in a private Signal group chat. The chat, which also included Hegseth’s wife, brother, and personal lawyer, was part of a broader issue of government officials using Signal for official communications.The suit expands on an earlier version filed by American Oversight in response to the revelation that Hegseth, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, and Vice President JD Vance were part of a separate Signal chat where they discussed sensitive matters about military strikes in Yemen against Houthi rebels. The lawsuit contends that the use of Signal by top officials for official government business is widespread and may violate federal records retention requirements.American Oversight’s new request asks Judge James Boasberg, who is overseeing the case, to preserve messages sent by or received from Hegseth, Ratcliffe, and other officials, including National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Late last month, Boasberg had already ordered the preservation of messages from the ""Houthi PC Small Group Chat,"" where officials discussed the Yemen strikes.Hegseth's use of Signal for these communications raised further concern when it was revealed that a second chat—dubbed “Defense 'Team Huddle'”—included details of the same Yemen strikes and involved 13 individuals, including Hegseth's family members and other personal associates. The group was not authorized to use Signal for sensitive or classified information, raising questions about the handling of government communication.In response, the White House and Pentagon dismissed concerns, accusing former employees of spreading false information. White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly argued that ""no classified information was shared"" in the chats and claimed that disgruntled ex-employees were attempting to undermine the administration.President Donald Trump publicly defended Hegseth, calling any concerns over his actions a ""waste of time."" Speaking on the South Lawn after the Easter Egg Roll, Trump expressed confidence in Hegseth's handling of military operations. ""He's doing a great job – ask the Houthis how he's doing,"" Trump remarked, referring to the Yemen rebel group targeted in the strikes.Trump’s backing of Hegseth is part of a broader pattern of standing by his top officials, despite controversies. Sources close to the president have stated that Trump is determined to resist any pressure to dismiss Hegseth, emphasizing that he does not want to provide satisfaction to ""fake news"" outlets by firing a key figure in his administration.","The lawsuit was filed in US District Court in Washington, DC.

Sheyla Baez Ramirez , garrison commander of Fort McCoy in Wisconsin, after images of President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth were missing from the base’s chain of command display.The Army confirmed the suspension Monday but clarified, “This suspension is not related to any misconduct. We have no further details to provide at this time while this matter is under review,” the US Army Reserve Command said in a statement.The move follows social media outrage and a formal investigation launched by the Department of Defense (DOD) into why the display wall featured empty frames where the images of Trump, Vance, and Hegseth should have appeared. The incident gained attention after Hegseth reposted a message on X that stated: “Commander of Fort McCoy, whose base chain-of-command board was missing photos of Trump, Vance and Hegseth, has been SUSPENDED.”Shortly afterward, a new image was posted showing the wall had been updated. “Regarding the Ft. McCoy Chain of Command wall controversy… WE FIXED IT! Also, an investigation has begun to figure out exactly what happened,” the Pentagon’s rapid response team wrote on X.Ramirez took over as garrison commander in July 2024 and had previously served in key roles, including at Fort Belvoir, Virginia.Her suspension comes amid broader leadership upheavals in the military. Earlier this month, Col. Susannah Meyers was removed from command at Pituffik Space Force Base in Greenland after internal backlash to an email in which she distanced herself from remarks made by Vice President Vance during a visit. The Space Force cited a “loss of confidence in her ability to lead.”In a separate controversy, Hegseth dismissed four aides last week following tensions over internal leaks tied to a second Signal group chat discussing Houthi strikes. The chat reportedly included Hegseth’s wife, brother, and personal lawyer. Hegseth attributed the leak to “disgruntled employees.”","Col.

Who is the Camerlengo?

As the first Jesuit and Latin American pontiff, Pope Francis , died on Easter Monday at the age of 88, the responsibility of leading the Catholic Church has fallen to Cardinal Kevin Farrell , the Vatican 's camerlengo , during its period of mourning and transition.It was Farrell who stood before the world to deliver sombre news from the Vatican, ""The Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the Father’s house."" He is an Irish-born cardinal and longtime ally of the late pontiff.As camerlengo, Farrell has now assumed an important administrative role in Vatican to oversee the Church's daily operations and preparing for the election of a new pope.""Dearest brothers and sisters, with deep sorrow, I must announce the death of our Holy Father Francis,"" Farrell said. ""At 7:35 this morning, The Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the Father’s house… With immense gratitude for his example as a true disciple of the Lord Jesus, we commend the soul of Pope Francis to the infinite merciful love of God."" he added while delivering the news of Francis's death.As the papal throne is now vacant, Cardinal Farrell has assumed an important role that is vital to the Church's continuity. As camerlengo — or chamberlain — he becomes the acting head of the Vatican during the "" sede vacante ,"" the period between the death (or resignation) of a pope and the election of a new one.The camerlengo's first official duty is to verify the pope's death and draw up the death certificate. Farrell will also place ceremonial seals on the pope's bedroom and study and begin preparations for the funeral, which is expected to draw global dignitaries and millions of mourners.But his role doesn't end there. Over the coming weeks, Farrell will oversee the day-to-day administration of the Holy See, chairing a committee of three other cardinals and coordinating with Vatican officials to ensure the smooth functioning of Church affairs.Pope Francis, the first Latin American pontiff and a global religious leader known for his humility, compassion, and progressive stance on social issues, died on Monday at the age of 88, the Vatican announced. His death followed a prolonged battle with respiratory illness and marks the end of a historic 12-year papacy that left a deep imprint on the Catholic Church and the world.The Argentine-born pope had been hospitalised at Rome's Gemelli hospital since February 14, 2025, with a severe respiratory crisis that developed into double pneumonia. It was the longest hospitalisation of his papacy, lasting 38 days. Francis had long suffered from lung complications, having had part of one lung removed in his youth.World leaders including PM Modi, former US President Joe Biden, US Vice President JD Vance, Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, French President Emmanuel Macron, Israeli President Isaac Herzog and others mourned Pope Francis.","Cardinal Kevin Farrell is the Vatican's camerlengo, or chamberlain.

The US Justice Department on Monday announced it was charging 27 people accused of being connected to Venezuelan drug gang Tren de Aragua with an array of serious crimes, including drug conspiracy, sex trafficking and murder.Acting US Attorney for New York's Southern District Matthew Podolsky said those charged included alleged members, former members, and associates of Tren de Aragua,"" a gang designated by US President Donald Trump as a ""foreign terrorist organization.""Of the 27 defendants, 21 were in federal custody and five more were arrested Sunday and Monday in New York and other jurisdictions, the statement said.The charges include murder, shootings, human trafficking of women into sex work, extortion and drug trafficking , the department said.Tren de Aragua became a high-profile target of law enforcement under the Trump administration after the president declared the group a ""terrorist"" organization and invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, saying the United States was facing an ""invasion.""Since then, Trump has sent two planeloads of alleged members to a prison in El Salvador on March 15 -- a case that led to a standoff with US courts.Attorneys for several of the deported Venezuelans have said that their clients were not members of Tren de Aragua, had committed no crimes and were targeted largely on the basis of their tattoos.Despite facing challenges, the US Supreme Court lifted a lower court order barring the deportations on April 7, handing Trump a long-sought political victory.The court did note, however, that the deportees must be given an opportunity to legally challenge their removal -- a requirement that Trump has called unworkable.""We cannot give everyone a trial, because to do so would take, without exaggeration, 200 years,"" the US president said in a social media post on Monday.","The charges include murder, shootings, human trafficking of women into sex work, extortion and drug trafficking.

Mob lynches Ahmadi businessman in Karachi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/mob-lynches-ahmadi-businessman-in-karachi/articleshow/120494757.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The death of Laeeq Cheema , a 47-year-old Ahmadi businessman, killed by a frenzied mob for praying in a Karachi worship hall, has ignited outrage, exposing the relentless persecution of Pakistan’s Ahmadiyya community.The attack, led by activists of the far-right Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) enraged over Cheema allegedly filming them on Sunday, underscores a state-backed system of bigotry.Pakistan’s 500,000 Ahmadis face an apartheid-like existence, stripped of religious freedom since the 1974 second amendment to the constitution declared them non-Muslims. Ordinance XX of 1984 bans Ahmadis from identifying as Muslims or using Islamic symbols, with violations risking imprisonment or death under blasphemy laws. Over 4,100 Ahmadis have faced charges since, including 335 for blasphemy, fuelled by TLP’s hate-filled rhetoric at Khatm-e-Nabuwat conferences. Urdu media and businesses amplify this bigotry, with shops in Punjab and Sindh refusing service to Ahmadis.The Karachi lynching is not isolated. In 2023, 34 attacks targeted Ahmadi worship sites, with police often complicit, demolishing graves or detaining victims instead of attackers.After Cheema’s killing, a TLP-affiliated union council chairman and over a dozen others were arrested, but justice remains doubtful. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan condemned police for taking 25 Ahmadis into “protective custody”, calling it state-enabled persecution. Posts on X labeled it “religious apartheid”.The military, though not directly involved, shares blame for this impunity. General Zia-ul-Haq’s 1980s Islamisation policies entrenched anti-Ahmadi laws, and the military’s political dominance lets groups like TLP thrive. The state’s inaction against TLP’s violent campaigns, like the 2017 Islamabad sit-in, emboldens mobs. Last June, 11 Ahmadis in Punjab faced FIRs after TLP complaints, with police caving to extremists.Ahmadis live in fear, hiding their identities to avoid harassment, job loss, or violence. Many boycott censuses, shun public worship, and face grave desecration. Cheema’s death highlights their vulnerability, with women especially trapped by religious and gender discrimination.","Laeeq Cheema, a 47-year-old Ahmadi businessman, killed by a frenzied mob for praying in a Karachi worship hall.

Poll Should the federal government halt the canal project in response to protests? No, it should continue Yes, it should be halted

A Pakistani Hindu state minister was attacked with tomatoes and potatoes in Sindh on Saturday by protesters opposing the federal government’s proposed canal projects, which critics say will reduce the province’s share of irrigation water.Kheal Das Kohistani , state minister for religious affairs in Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s cabinet, was targeted by a group of demonstrators in Thatta district, however, he remained unharmed.The attack, which took place amid rising tensions over the Green Pakistan Initiative , drew swift condemnation from both federal and provincial authorities. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif termed the assault on Kohistani “unacceptable” and assured of “a thorough investigation” into the incident. “The attack on the public representatives is unacceptable. The persons involved in the incident would be given exemplary punishment,” he said.Federal information minister Atta Tarar also called it “an attack” and sought a report from the Sindh Inspector General of Police and the federal interior secretary.Sindh chief minister Syed Murad Ali Shah issued a stern warning against taking the law into one’s own hands and instructed Hyderabad’s deputy inspector general to arrest the culprits immediately.Kohistani, a member of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), hails from Sindh’s Jamshoro district and was first elected to parliament in 2018. He returned to the National Assembly in 2024 and was later appointed as a state minister.The protestors chanted slogans against the PML-N-led federal government, accusing it of threatening Sindh’s agricultural livelihood by backing controversial canal projects in Punjab under the Green Pakistan Initiative.The plan, supported by the federal government, Punjab authorities and the military, includes the construction of six new canals to irrigate Cholistan. Opponents argue it will cut downriver water flow to Sindh, worsening irrigation issues in the province.Political tensions flared further after PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari issued a strong warning to the PML-N at a rally in Hyderabad. He said the PPP would withdraw support from the federal government if the canal plan wasn’t shelved.In response, PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif directed the federal government to initiate talks with the PPP to resolve the dispute amicably.Rana Sanaullah, a senior PML-N leader and adviser to the prime minister, later stated, “Politics should not be played over the issue of water. Matters must be resolved through dialogue.” He reiterated that the 1991 Water Accord and 1992 IRSA Act protect inter-provincial water rights.","Kheal Das Kohistani, state minister for religious affairs in Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s cabinet, was targeted by a group of demonstrators in Thatta district.

"‘No right to appeal for Kulbhushan Jadhav’: ICJ only granted consular access, Pakistan SC told",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/no-right-to-appeal-for-kulbhushan-jadhav-icj-only-granted-consular-access-pakistan-sc-told/articleshow/120450503.cms,"Poll Do you believe Kulbhushan Jadhav should have the right to appeal his conviction? No, the conviction should stand Yes, he deserves an appeal

The Pakistani Supreme Court was told on Wednesday that Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav was never granted the right to appeal his conviction because the 2019 ruling by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) only required consular access , not a legal right to challenge his sentence, the Dawn reported.Pak defence ministry counsel Khawaja Haris Ahmed, appearing before a seven-judge constitutional bench, said the ICJ ruling did not obligate Pakistan to provide Jadhav, who was convicted of espionage and terrorism, with an automatic right to appeal. “The ICJ verdict addressed only the consular access issue under Article 36 of the Vienna Convention. It never directed Pakistan to extend appeal rights,” he told the court.The bench is currently hearing 38 intra-court appeals, including from the federal and provincial governments, against the Supreme Court’s October 2023 judgment that struck down military trials for civilians involved in the May 9 riots.Responding to criticism that Pakistani citizens convicted by military courts after the May 9 violence are not being given the same appeal options as Jadhav, Haris argued that Pakistan’s 2021 ICJ (Review and Re-consideration) Act was a “unique jurisdiction” created specifically for compliance with the ICJ ruling, not a general legal provision.The Dawn reported Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar pointed out that the ICJ law stemmed from earlier Pakistani court rulings like the 2017 Said Zaman Khan case, which had expanded the rights of the accused. Justice Musarrat Hilali added that the Said Zaman ruling, initially contested by the government, was eventually cited in Pakistan’s defence before the ICJ.The case of Jadhav, a former Indian Navy officer, remains one of the most high-profile legal controversies between India and Pakistan. Captured in Balochistan in 2016, Jadhav was sentenced to death by a military court in 2017. India moved the ICJ, which ordered Pakistan to grant him consular access but stopped short of overturning the conviction.Attorney General Mansoor Usman Awan is expected to weigh in on whether Pakistani civilians tried in military courts post-May 9 should be allowed to appeal, a decision that could have broader implications for the ongoing constitutional debate.Justice Jamal Mandokhail pressed the government on whether military court proceedings can begin without filing a formal FIR. The counsel replied that under Section 157 of the Pakistan Army Act, a court of inquiry can initiate proceedings and no FIR is needed.","Pakistani Supreme Court told Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav was never granted the right to appeal his conviction.

Poll Do you support Pakistan's recent deportation of Afghan refugees? No, it harms vulnerable families. Yes, it's necessary for national security.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar met Afghan acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Kabul on Saturday to mend frayed bilateral ties strained by security concerns and the contentious repatriation of Afghan refugees.The high-level talks, which included meeting with Afghan interim prime minister Mullah Muhammad Hassan Akhund and other officials, focused on trade, security and people-to-people ties, but the shadow of Pakistan’s intensified deportation drive loomed large, particularly for low-income Afghans facing upheaval.The visit, described by Pakistan’s foreign office as a “reflection of commitment to enhance sustained engagement”, follows a recent Pak-Afghan joint coordination committee meeting in Kabul. Dar emphasised “brotherly ties” and opportunities for trade, stating, “Our link with Central Asia depends on Afghanistan as a partner.”However, the talks come as Pakistan has expelled over 80,000 Afghans since April 1, targeting those deemed “illegal”, including many low-income families integrated into Pakistani society for decades.Afghanistan’s foreign ministry expressed deep concerns over the expulsions, with Muttaqi urging “dialogue based on trust” to resolve the issue. “The forced deportation of Afghans is unacceptable and undermines mutual respect,” he said, highlighting the plight of vulnerable returnees facing economic hardship and insecurity in Afghanistan.Since Nov 2023, Pakistan has repatriated 907,000 Afghans, with 44,000 still awaiting relocation to Western countries.In Pakistan’s border regions, low-income Afghan families, many of whom fled conflict decades ago, face acute distress. Akbar Khan, a Peshawar restaurant owner, said, “I’ve been here 50 years. This is my home, but now we’re being uprooted.” The rugged border terrain complicates enforcement, with many returnees using illegal channels to re-enter Pakistan.","Pakistan's deputy prime minister and foreign minister met Afghan acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Kabul.

Tensions quickly escalated when the group accused the minority community of violating Pakistan’s controversial anti-Ahmadi laws.“One member of the community was killed after the mob identified him as an Ahmadi,” said Muhammad Safdar, a senior police official in Karachi.“They attacked him with sticks and bricks.”Police said members of several religious parties were part of the mob. To protect others from further violence, officers took around 25 Ahmadis into custody and moved them away in a police-escorted van after negotiating with the crowd, which had swelled to around 600 people.The Ahmadiyya community, considered heretical by Pakistan’s state and many religious groups, has long faced systemic discrimination. Ahmadis, who have a population of almost 10 million worldwide, consider themselves Muslims and have faith identical to mainstream Islam in almost every manner. Though they regard themselves as Muslim, a 1974 constitutional amendment declared them non-Muslim, and a 1984 ordinance criminalised many of their religious practices.Friday’s killing is the latest in a long history of persecution. According to community records, six Ahmadis have been killed in 2024 so far, with over 280 killed since 1984. Thousands more have faced criminal charges, including hundreds under Pakistan’s harsh blasphemy laws.Abdul Qadir Ashrafi, a 52-year-old businessman who took part in the protest, said the group’s intention was to pressure police to act against the Ahmadis.“We requested that the place be sealed and that those conducting the Friday prayers be arrested, with criminal proceedings initiated against them,” he told AFP.The human rights commission of Pakistan condemned the attack, saying it was ""appalled by the orchestrated attack by a far-right religious party on a colonial-era Ahmadi place of worship.""“This failure of law and order is a stark reminder of the continued complicity of the state in the systematic persecution of a beleaguered community,” the commission posted on social media platform X.Mob violence has become an all-too-common response to accusations of blasphemy in Pakistan, often with deadly consequences. In a similar incident last year, dozens of churches were torched in the city of Jaranwala after a Christian man was falsely accused of blasphemy.","A member of Pakistan’s Ahmadiyya community was beaten to death on Friday after a mob of radical surrounded an Ahmadi place of worship in Karachi.

Bangladesh on Thursday called on Pakistan to issue a formal apology for the genocide committed by its forces during the 1971 liberation war.

The meeting that took place today was supposed to be a regular practice, but the last one was held in 2010,” Bangladesh foreign secretary Jasim Uddin said at the meeting.Uddin shared details of the day's diplomatic engagements, following a round of secretary-level talks held earlier that morning at the Padma state guest house.He led the Bangladeshi delegation, while Pakistan’s foreign secretary Amna Baloch headed her side. Following the talks, Baloch paid courtesy visits to chief adviser professor Muhammad Yunus and Foreign Affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain.
