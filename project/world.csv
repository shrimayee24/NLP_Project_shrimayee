Usha Chilukuri Vance , an Indian-origin litigator, is the wife of J D Vance, who was recently announced as Donald Trump 's vice presidential pick for the upcoming US elections on Monday. Usha Vance carries rich Indian cultural values and has a strong legal background, making her a key figure in this political partnership.Usha Vance, daughter of Indian immigrants, is a litigator at a national law firm.She graduated from Yale University with a bachelor's degree in History and earned a Master of Philosophy degree from the University of Cambridge. A corporate litigator at a prestigious law firm in San Francisco, has clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts of the Supreme Court , as well as for Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his tenure as an appeals court judge.Raised in a suburb of San Diego, California, Usha's upbringing emphasised education and hard work. Her academic journey saw her serving as Managing Editor of the Yale Journal of Law & Technology and Executive Development Editor of The Yale Law Journal. As a Gates fellow at Cambridge, she engaged with left-wing and liberal groups and was a registered Democrat in 2014.Usha and JD Vance first met at Yale Law School and were married in Kentucky in 2014. Their wedding included a Hindu priest presiding over a separate ceremony. The couple has three children together.Usha Vance has been instrumental in her husband's political success. She played a key role in helping JD Vance organise his thoughts on the social decline in rural white America, which inspired his best-selling memoir, ""Hillbilly Elegy."" The memoir was adapted into a film directed by Ron Howard in 2020.In the past, Usha has made some rare public appearances alongside JD Vance during his campaign from the Ohio Senate seat.As the US presidential elections approach, former President Donald Trump announced JD Vance as his Vice Presidential pick. Trump confirmed Vance's candidacy through a social media post.""Usha Vance is a highly accomplished attorney and daughter of Indian immigrants—and her husband brings youth and diversity to the Trump ticket,"" said AI Mason, a US-based global real estate investment advisor and entrepreneur, speaking to ANI. ""She knows the Indian culture and all about India. She can be a big help to her husband in navigating great ties between USA and India,"" added Mason.Earlier, in an interview with Fox & Friends, Usha Chilukuri Vance and her husband talked about their different faiths and his potential candidacy for Vice President of the US.""I don't think people understand how hard he works and how creative he is. Everything he says and does is built on a foundation of so much thought. He's always trying to do better,"" said Usha Vance.On supporting her husband, Usha told Fox, ""There are a few different reasons...One is that I grew up in a religious household. My parents are Hindu, and that was one of the things that made them such good parents, that makes them really very good people. And so I think I've seen that...the power of that in my own life, and I knew that JD was searching for something. This just felt right for him.""The interview was conducted three weeks before JD Vance was announced as Trump's running mate for the upcoming US presidential elections.JD Vance was born James David Bowman in Middletown, Ohio, to a mother who struggled with addiction and a father who left the family when he was a toddler. Raised by his grandparents, Vance's challenging early life shaped his perspectives.The Trump campaign has stated that following his near-death experience, the former president will focus on calling for unity in times of tragedy, instead of criticising his political adversaries. This approach will be pivotal as he faces off against President Biden in the 2024 election rematch.","Usha Chilukuri Vance is the wife of J D Vance, who was recently announced as Donald Trump's vice presidential pick for the upcoming US elections.

But courage can be contagious, too. That, too, is what it means to be an American...If you're at home and you disagree with everything I just said, our message to you is this: We will still defend to the death your right to say it, because that is who we are as Americans,"" said Ramaswamy, who had exited the presidential race earlier this year.He highlighted the opportunity for Americans to hold differing opinions yet come together peacefully, stating, ""We are the country where we can disagree like hell and still get together at the dinner table at the end of it. That is the America I know. That is the America we miss.""Tesla CEO Elon Musk reacted to Ramaswamy's remarks, ""Well said!!""on his X handle.Ramaswamy emphasised the US's potential for growth, asserting, ""we don't need to be a nation in decline,"" and that it can still be a ""nation in ascent"" with its best days ahead.He elaborated that in the US, people can succeed based on their hard work and dedication irrespective of their identity or background. ""That country where, no matter who you are, where your parents came from or what your skin color is, or how long your last name is, you will still get ahead in this country with your own hard work, your own commitment, your own dedication, and that you know what? You are free to speak your mind at every step of the way,"" he said.The GOP leader further linked the concept of ' American exceptionalism ' to the potential revival under Donald Trump's presidency. ""That is the American dream. That is what won us the American Revolution. That is what reunited us after the American Civil War. That is what won us two world wars and the Cold War. That is what still gives hope to the free world,"" Ramaswamy stated.He added, ""And if we can revive that dream over group identity, victimhood, and grievance, then nobody in the world, not a nation, not a corporation, not a virus, not China, is going to defeat us. That is what American exceptionalism is all about. And that is what we will revive this November when we send Donald J Trump back to the White House.""Earlier in the day, the 38-year-old addressed the issue of illegal immigration, promising firm action. ""Our message to illegal immigrants is also this; we will return you to your country of origin. Not because you're all bad people, but because you broke the law, and the United States of America was founded on the rule of law,"" he declared.Ramaswamy also pledged to seal the southern border on the first day if they came to power.Speaking directly to black Americans, he sought to counter media perceptions about Republican neglect. ""The media has tried to convince you for decades that Republicans don't care about your communities. We want for you what we want for every American: safe neighborhoods, clean streets, good jobs, a better life for your children, and a justice system that treats everyone equally - regardless of your skin color or your political beliefs,"" he said.","Ramaswamy emphasised the US's potential for growth, asserting, ""we don't need to be a nation in decline,"" and that it can still be a ""nation in ascent"" with its best days ahead.

They said a larger bench should clarify which order - May 13, 2022, or Jan 8, 2024 - would be applicable.A bench headed by Justice Sanjiv Khanna said their petition was misconceived and the appeal was filed against its verdict in the garb of a PIL under Article 32.

""When a serious criminal offence is alleged, police machinery must move with alacrity to gather evidence, which otherwise may be obliterated with passage of time and the constitutional post holder may influence witnesses,"" he said.A bench of CJI D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra issued notice to West Bengal govt, sought assistance of attorney general R Venkataramani to adjudicate this complex constitutional question and asked Divan to make Centre a party to the petition where the woman said while she was left without remedy, the governor is giving statements ridiculing her and trashing her allegations as politically motivated.It posted the matter for hearing after three weeks.Clauses 2 and 3 of Article 361 of the Constitution provides, ""No criminal proceedings whatsoever shall be instituted or continued against the President, or the governor of a state, in any court during his term of office; and, no process for the arrest or imprisonment of the President, or the governor of a state, shall issue from any court during his term of office.""The petitioner, who has a masters in computer applications and was working in Raj Bhavan's EPABX department, through her advocate on record Udayaditya Banerjee said SC must decide whether the immunity conferred on the President and governors could be unfettered and absolute, a privilege that is conferred on none as all are governed by the rule of law.""While a civil suit against the governor can be instituted after two months of a notice in writing is served on the governor, no such timeline is prescribed for criminal proceedings, which again renders the petitioner remediless,"" the petition said.""The incident resulting in the present case arises out of two major instances that took place on April 24 and May 2 this year, when the Bengal governor called upon her on a false pretext of offering her a better job only to sexually harass her, within the premises of Raj Bhavan during working hours,"" the petition alleged.Giving details of the alleged sexual harassment and molestation in the petition, she said while no action was taken by police to investigate her complaint, the governor has been giving statements to media terming her as a political tool.","For the first time, Supreme Court will test the constitutional validity of immunity from criminal proceedings accorded to the President and governors.

""It drew close to me. I did not have time to think. I raised my axe and struck the animal on its forehead. I was lucky the tiger died in one blow. Had I hit on any other part of its body, the tiger would not have given me a second chance,"" she had said. Lalzadingi had said she only had the future of her children in mind when she came face-to-face with the animal. ""My two little kids, the younger just three months old, came to my mind... I did not have a choice. I had to kill it before it killed me.""She was decorated with Shaurya Chakra for her bravery in 1980 and received the award from then President Neelam Sanjiva Reddy in New Delhi. A young woman killing a fearsome animal with just an axe was an extraordinary story at that time, and it travelled beyond the borders of Mizoram.","Lalzadingi killed the tiger with a single blow of an axe 46 years ago. She was only 26 when she had an unexpected encounter with the wild cat in a jungle not far from her village. ""My two little kids, the younger just three months old, came to my mind... I had to kill it before it killed me,"" she said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111871191,imgsize-974021,width-400,resizemode-4/111871191.jpg"

TOI

CHENNAI: Exposing more tentacles of the gold smuggling racket at Chennai airport , government has suspended an undisclosed number of immigration officials for their suspected links with the smugglers .A top Intelligence Bureau official said three of the officials had been placed under suspension. But airport sources toldthat many more officers have faced action.“The number is being under-reported to avoid scrutiny of the immigration section by other agencies such as Directorate of Revenue intelligence (DRI) and Customs ,” an official said.The charge against the suspended personnel is that, for a cut from the smugglers, they collected gold from carriers arriving at the airport and sneaked it outside to receivers. They are also accused of allowing flyers through without scrutinising passports and other documents properly.An IB officer, who did not wish to be identified, said the nexus of the three officers with gold smugglers was being probed. One of them is Saravanan, who was on deputation to the IB. The officer refused to name the other two. “Action is being taken for the charges against them as mentioned in the memo,” he said.The officer said the suspension procedure was initiated only for internal procedural lapses. “We got intelligence that they allow flyers without verification of documents under the Emigration Check Not Required (ECNR) category. How long they have been doing this and the money trail are being probed. If their involvement in gold smuggling had been proved, they would have been booked by now,” he said.The officer said the suspension orders were issued before Customs busted a cartel that smuggled in 267kg gold, worth about Rs 167 crore, in about two months. They used a souvenir shop as a front at the international terminal.Officials said they have detected similar offences in the past and suspended erring personnel. At least 45 immigration personnel, including many state police personnel on deputation to IB, are deployed at the airport for clearing international passengers.","Officials accused of allowing flyers through without scrutinising passports and other documents properly.

Yorkshire police assured complete investigation



Reactions from Officials



Major riots broke out in Leeds, UK, with protesters overturning police vehicle and setting double-decker bus on fire.West Yorkshire Police reported that they were dispatched to Luxor Street, Harehills , at 5 pm on Thursday in response to an ongoing incident. Upon arrival, officers ""found an ongoing disturbance which involved some agency workers and some children.""As a crowd began to gather, the officers decided to relocate the agency workers and children to a safer location.However, the situation escalated, and ""pockets of disorder"" emerged in the area.Social media posts allegedly showed a sizable crowd gathered on the street, with a police car being overturned and a bus being set on fire.Reports suggest that the riots were triggered by a protest following the removal of four children from a family by social services. One of the children had been taken to the hospital for treatment of an injury inflicted by a sibling. Local media reports indicate that the hospital authorities informed social services about the incident, leading to the children being removed from the family, which in turn sparked the protests.Police arrived to find an ongoing disturbance. By 9 pm, no uniformed officers were visible at the main disturbance site, although a police helicopter monitored the situation from above. Yorkshire police promised a thorough investigation into all criminal activities, including property damage caused by fires, and emphasised their commitment to holding those responsible accountable. ""We want to emphasise that those responsible will face the full consequences of the law,"" said the police.Tom Riordan, chief executive of the Leeds City Council, said calm was restored by about 1 am and authorities have already begun to clean up the damage.“There was a family incident earlier in the day that the police attended and our officials attended that a lot of the community got concerned about,” Riordan said in an interview with the BBC. “And that appeared to be the trigger of concern for groups of people being concerned about what had happened.”Mayor of West Yorkshire, Tracy Brabin, expressed gratitude to emergency services in a social media post and urged those escalating tensions to reconsider their actions. She noted that no serious injuries had been reported. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper condemned the violence, stating that such disorder has no place in society. Councillor Salma Arif of Gipton and Harehills urged residents to remain indoors in a video statement, confirming that police were managing the situation. ""There is an ongoing situation currently in Harehills, we’re aware of that so police are here. We are asking everybody in the area to please stay at home at this moment in time,"" she said.","Major riots broke out in Leeds, UK, with protesters overturning police vehicle and setting double-decker bus on fire.

What is Bangladesh's quota system and will it be reintroduced?

The United Nations human rights chief on Friday called the attacks on student protesters in Bangladesh ""shocking and unacceptable,"" as the death toll from the crackdown by authorities crossed the 100 mark.Almost daily demonstrations broke out at the beginning of July against plans to reintroduce job quotas for public sector jobs , which were abolished in 2018 after earlier student protests.The students are demanding a merit-based system.""I am deeply concerned by this week’s violence in Bangladesh , resulting in reports of dozens of deaths and hundreds of injuries. The attacks on student protesters are particularly shocking and unacceptable,"" UN human rights chief Volker Turk said in a statement.""There must be impartial, prompt and exhaustive investigations into these attacks, and those responsible held to account,"" the statement continued.Turk said he was very worried about reports of the deployment of paramilitary police units , which he said have ""long track records of violations.""He urged the government to take measures to ensure the safety of students in peaceful protests and to guarantee the right to freedom of assembly without fear of attacks.Violence continued in the capital Dhaka on Friday as several hundred student demonstrators blocked roads and clashed with police, the day after the bloodiest day of the protests.Police fired tear gas to scatter protesters in some areas, journalists from Reuters news agency said. One reporter said many fires could be seen across the city.A tally by AFP news agency, based on victims from hospitals around the country put the death toll at 105, late Friday. They included at least 52 people killed Friday, according to a list drawn up by the Dhaka Medical College Hospital.The government has not released a figure for the number of dead.Also Friday, Dhaka's police force banned all public gatherings for the day - a first since the protests began.A group of demonstrators stormed a jail in the central Bangladeshi district of Narsingdi, freeing hundreds of inmates and setting the facility on fire, AFP news agency reported, citing a police officer.Trains services were suspended nationwide, communications networks were disrupted and television news channels, including the state broadcaster BTW, fell silent.The official websites of the central bank, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's office and the police appeared to have been hacked by a group calling itself ""THE R3SISTANC3,"" Reuters reported.Ruhul Kabir Rizvi, a senior leader of the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, which has backed the protests, was arrested.Hasina's office late Friday announced a nationwide curfew and deployed military personnel to keep order.The quota system would allow for more than half of public-sector jobs to be reserved for certain groups.Some 30% of jobs would be set aside for the descendants of ex-military personnel who fought for the country's independence against Pakistan in 1971. A smaller quota would be earmarked for women, the disabled and people from poor neighborhoods.Critics say the proposals are discriminatory and will benefit those groups aligned with the Awami League party of Hasina, who has ruled Bangladesh with an iron fist for the past 15 years.Competition for stable and lucrative public-sector jobs in Bangladesh is fierce. Each year, some 400,000 graduates compete for around 3,000 jobs in the civil service exam.The quota system is potentially being reintroduced after the High Court last month overturned a ban when relatives of the 1971 veterans filed petitions.That ruling was suspended by the Supreme Court pending an appeal hearing scheduled for Sunday.On Wednesday, Hasina urged protesters in a televised address to ""wait with patience"" for the court verdict, saying that she believes they ""will get justice"" and ""will not be disappointed.""The government also said it had offered to hold talks with the protesters but the call was rejected.","UN human rights chief calls attacks on student protesters in Bangladesh ""shocking and unacceptable"" Death toll from crackdown by authorities crosses the 100 mark.

As per Karnataka Cine and Cultural Activists (Welfare) Bill of 2024 introduced in the legislative assembly on Friday, the cess will range between 1% and 2% and will be determined by the govt.Labour secretary Mohammad Mohsin said the govt also plans to extend the cess to theatrical plays staged within the state.The bill proposes establishment of a seven-member welfare board for cine workers and cultural activists, with one-third of the members nominated for a three-year term.The board will use the cess to support social-security schemes for film workers .According to Karnataka Film Workers' Artists' Technicians' Union, some 2,355 workers, including artists and technicians, are working in the industry. However, many small-time artists and technicians may not have registered with any organisation in the state. Each registered member will receive a unique identity card to claim benefits. There is uncertainty on how the cess will be imposed on OTT subscriptions, which are typically managed through online platforms without local addresses.

A 'miserable relationship'

A regional court in the Bavarian capital , Munich , on Friday issued the German World Cup-winning soccer star Jerome Boateng with a warning over alleged intentional bodily harm against his ex-girlfriend .Ex-Bayern Munich player Boateng received a suspended fine of €200,000 ($227,000), which he would only have to pay if he committed another offense.The proceedings center on allegations of violence made by Boateng's former partner, the mother of his 13-year-old twins, during a vacation together in the Caribbean in 2018.It was the third retrial of the case. The presiding judge spoke of a toxic relationship between Boateng and his former partner.Prosecutors had demanded a fine of €1.12 million, while the defense maintained the incident in question amounted only to a scuffle and argued for a more moderate sentence.Boateng denied hitting his former partner and throwing a lantern and cooling bag at her during the vacation. Early in the trial, he spoke of a ""nightmare,"" while his lawyer maintained there had been a ""fabricated narrative of a wife-beater.""In a summing up on Friday, presiding judge Susanne Hemmerich said this narrative did not stand.Before the closing arguments, a mutual acquaintance of Boateng and his ex-girlfriend had given evidence, describing their relationship as emotionally charged and very difficult. The pair had ""a miserable relationship,"" the man said.The court had heard that Boateng had pushed his ex-girlfriend away to defend himself and that she had injured him on the lip.Boateng was found guilty of domestic violence in the case in September 2021 and ordered to pay a €1.8 million euro fine — the highest possible financial damages that could be imposed by the district court in which he was tried. Boateng's team appealed the verdict.In November 2022, he was ordered to pay €1.2 million to his former partner after the assault sentence was upheld. That decision was overturned at a regional court because of legal errors, meaning the process had to be restarted.The long-time Bayern defender recently transferred from the Italian club US Salernitana to the Austrian side Linzer ASK.","Jerome Boateng receives a suspended fine of €200,000 ($227,000) over alleged intentional bodily harm.

How can any Dem pushing him to drop out of the presidential race argue in good faith that he should stay on as POTUS?"" Vance questioned.This comment parallels sentiments from several Democrats urging Biden to drop out as the party nominee. Biden's debate performance, lasting 90 minutes, drew critical responses due to his visible struggle with vocal clarity and statistical citations. Democratic dissatisfaction was highlighted when Senator Martin Heinrich and four House Democrats publicly called for Biden to withdraw his re-election bid.Biden faced additional challenges last week as a report indicated that nearly 20 Congressional Democrats suggested he step down from the 2024 race. Most of these lawmakers, including national security Democrats Jim Hines and Adam Smith, hail from safe Democratic districts. Long-serving Congressman Lloyd Doggett of Texas was the first to voice this call, representing a secure seat and with nearly 30 years in Congress.Despite internal party pressure, Biden remained resolute in his candidacy. On Friday, he responded to Trump's previous speech at the Republican National Convention, criticising it as a bleak vision for America's future.""Donald Trump's dark vision for the future is not who we are as Americans. Together, as a party and as a country, we can and will defeat him at the ballot box,"" Biden emphasised.Biden also expressed his eagerness to resume campaigning and counter Trump's agenda while advocating for his own vision. ""I look forward to getting back on the campaign trail next week to continue exposing the threat of Donald Trump's Project 2025 agenda while making the case for my own record and the vision that I have for America: one where we save our democracy, protect our rights and freedoms, and create opportunity for everyone,"" Biden stated.Biden's campaigning efforts were temporarily paused after testing positive for Covid-19 during a trip to Las Vegas.

Netanyahu slams ICJ ruling as 'decision of lies'

Why is Israel occupying Palestinian territories?

Israel rejects Palestinian statehood

Israel's settlement policies in the occupied Palestinian territories amount to a violation of international law , the International Court of Justice (ICJ) said on Friday.The ruling from the top UN court is a non-binding advisory opinion that is unlikely to have much direct impact on Israeli policy, but will add to the mounting international pressure on Israel to outline a full strategy to end fighting in Gaza.The ruling is not connected to events since October 7, when Hamas militants led incursions into Israel, taking some 250 hostages and leading to the deaths of around 1,200 people, mostly civilians.The ICJ's panel of 15 judges said ""the transfer by Israel of settlers to the West Bank and Jerusalem as well as Israel's maintenance of their presence, is contrary to article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.""The court also said that Israel's use of natural resources in Palestinian territories was ""inconsistent"" with its obligations as an occupying power.The ICJ called the presence of Israeli forces in occupied territories illegal and said it should end ""as rapidly as possible.""The court also said Israel must pay reparations for the damages it caused during its occupation.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the court had made a ""decision of lies.""""The Jewish people are not occupiers in their own land — not in our eternal capital Jerusalem, nor in our ancestral heritage of Judea and Samaria,"" Netanyahu said in a statement.""No decision of lies in The Hague will distort this historical truth, and similarly, the legality of Israeli settlements in all parts of our homeland cannot be disputed,"" he added.Israel has occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem since the Six-Day War in 1967. More than 500,000 Israeli settlers have set up home across more than 100 settlements, already deemed illegal by the United Nations, on occupied land .Some 200,000 Israelis also live in East Jerusalem neighborhoods that Palestinians hope would make up their future capital city.The West Bank and East Jerusalem, along with Gaza, would be the foundational territories for a future Palestinian state, a plan backed by Israel's major supporters including the US and Germany.The ruling comes amid the backdrop of Israel's operations in Gaza, in response to the events of October 7, that have killed more than 38,800 people, mostly women and children, according to data from the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, figures that are deemed largely reliable by the UN.Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected the idea of a Palestinian state and has continued to promote Israeli settlements in the occupied territories.The Israeli parliament, the Knesset, also voted against the formation of a Palestinian state on Thursday, drawing condemnation from the German government.While Berlin has been largely reticent to criticize Israel, a spokesperson for the German Foreign Ministry on Friday said it was ""deeply troubled"" by the move, adding that ""Israel is isolating itself.""The ICJ took up the case in December 2022, after a large majority of the UN General Assembly voted on requesting an advisory opinion.The court is also considering a separate case filed by South Africa that accuses Israel of committing genocide in Gaza.","International Court of Justice says Israel's settlement policies violate international law.

RNC LIVE: Trump gives speech at Republican National Convention Day 4

Donald Trump , the Republican presidential candidate, on Thursday recounted his personal experience of the assassination attempt on his life during a rally at Pennsylvania rally.While delivering his speech at the closing night of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Trump called for unity among Americans.Trump vividly described the moment when the assassin's bullet nearly struck him, missing by a mere quarter of an inch.He shared the details of the incident, stating, ""I heard a loud whizzing sound and felt something hit me really, really hard on my right ear. I said to myself, 'Wow, what was that? It can only be a bullet. If I had not moved my head at that very last instant, the bullet would have perfectly hit its mark. I immediately knew it was very serious, that we were under attack, and in one movement proceeded to drop to the ground.""Trump said that the attack was swiftly ended by a Secret Service sniper, who took out the assassin with a single shot from a greater distance.“There was blood pouring everywhere, yet, in a certain way I felt very safe because I had God on my side,"" Trump said. “I'm not supposed to be here tonight.""The crowd responded with chants of ""Yes you are,"" to which Trump replied, ""I stand before you in this arena only by the grace of Almighty God. And watching the reports over the last few days, many people say it was a 'providential moment.' Probably was.""In the face of the assassination attempt, Trump described how he raised his fist in the air and began shouting ""fight, fight, fight,"" demonstrating his resilience and determination to continue his presidential campaign.Trump's speech served as the culmination of a four-day Republican rally that attracted thousands of conservative activists and elected officials to Wisconsin, a crucial swing state.With both candidates currently facing low popularity, Trump seized the opportunity presented by his near-death experience to adopt a new tone that he believes will generate more momentum in an election that seems to be shifting in his favor.Meanwhile, 81-year-old Democrat Biden faces mounting pressure from key congressional allies, donors, and even former President Barack Obama , who are concerned about his ability to secure reelection following his poor debate performance.","Trump vividly described the moment when the assassin's bullet nearly struck him, missing by a mere quarter of an inch.

Shooter flew drones over site hours before attempting a shot at Trump: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/shooter-flew-drones-over-site-hours-before-attempting-a-shot-at-trump-report/articleshow/111875074.cms,"The shooter who attempted a shot at former US President Donald Trump at the Pennsylvania rally allegedly flew drones above the site of Trump's speech, the Wall Street Journal reported. The new details that have emerged suggest that 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks flew the drone on a pre-programmed flight path to survey the grounds hours ahead of the ex-president's speech.The report said that the drone circled the location several times while Crooks observed the area and examined the event site. The planned route indicate that Thomas Matthew Crooks likely operated the drone multiple times to collect information about the event site. Crooks later made his way to a rooftop only about 430 feet away from where the Republican presidential candidate, 78, was speaking and fired at least six shots toward the former president.Crooks started researching the rally site soon after the Trump campaign announced the event on July 3, registering for it on July 7. Subsequently, visited the farm show grounds a few days later for further examination.Crooks then returned with two homemade bombs, designed to be remotely detonated using receivers similar to those found in fireworks. Investigators discovered these crude explosives in Crooks' car parked near the grounds, along with a ballistic vest containing three 30-round magazines, indicating he planned to cause more significant harm, as the report by the WSJ noted.This revelation also comes as other chilling information about the would-be assassin's sinister attempt emerge. Recently, it was reported that Thomas Crooks had posted a chilling message on social media, carried images of both Donald Trump and President Biden on his phone, and had searched the dates for the Democratic National Convention and Trump's Pennsylvania rally, making his sinister intentions clear before the assassination bid.According to multiple media reports, the individual who climbed onto a roof and opened fire at a Pennsylvania campaign rally had posted a threatening message on the gaming platform ""Steam,"" stating, ""July 13 will be my premiere, watch as it unfolds.""Investigators so far have examined the suspect's technological devices, including cell phones and a laptop, and discovered this message. On reviewing the laptop, they found searches conducted in July for topics like Trump, Biden, the DNC convention schedule, and the July 13 Trump rally.America's top security officials relayed this information to senators recently. Senators were quoted as telling the media that none of the interviewees reported hearing the suspect discuss politics.The suspect possessed two cell phones. The primary phone was recovered at the scene, along with a remote transmitter. A second cell phone, found at the suspect's home, contained only 27 contacts. The FBI is currently in the process of locating and interviewing these individuals.Multiple media reports also stated that Crooks visited a shooting range, stopped at Home Depot, and a gun store, where he purchased 50 rounds of ammunition and a 5-foot ladder ahead of the attack.Meanwhile, CNN reported that the investigating authorities have put together an early portrait of the would be assassin who is believed to be an intelligent loner with an interest in guns and strangely away from the fences of politics.","Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, flew a drone on a pre-programmed flight path to survey the grounds hours ahead of the ex-president's speech.

Local witnesses said the shots fired during the rally forced protesters to disperse. “Direct firing on peaceful protesters is state terrorism. The people of Bannu will continue their peaceful resistance with unity and consensus for peace,” said former senator Mushtaq Ahmed.Led by young activist Manzoor Pashteen, PTM is known for its strident criticism of Pakistan’s powerful military for its role in alleged enforced disappearances, extrajudicial killings of rights activists and ethnic leaders, as well as the alleged mistreatment of the Pakhtun community by security forces.Pashteen posted on X that the Pakistani army had opened fire on what he described as a “peaceful protest.” The demonstration came in the wake of a militant attack on a military base in the area on July 15 in which eight soldiers were killed.Islamabad has repeatedly raised concerns about cross-border attacks with the Taliban administration in Afghanistan, exacerbating tensions between the two countries. Security forces from both nations have clashed at the border in recent years.The protest underscores growing frustration and fear among residents in this remote region which has been a hotspot of militant activity.","Pakistan Army opened fire on hundreds of people gathered in the northwestern city of Bannu on Friday. At least three people were killed and more than 20 others were injured. The rally was organised by Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM), an organisation working for the rights of people affected by the war on terror.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,imgsize-110164,width-400,resizemode-4/47529300.jpg"
