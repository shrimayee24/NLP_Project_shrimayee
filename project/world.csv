'Couldn't tolerate my jovial nature': Tej Pratap Yadav says 5 families conspired to ruin his life; vows to expose them,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/couldnt-tolerate-my-jovial-nature-tej-pratap-yadav-says-5-families-conspired-to-ruin-his-life-vows-to-expose-them/articleshow/123443310.cms,"NEW DELHI: Expelled RJD leader and former Bihar minister Tej Pratap Yadav on Thursday alleged that five powerful families conspired against him to destroy both his political and personal life.The elder son of RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav claimed he would soon reveal their identities.“Five families together and in a broader conspiracy tried to end my political life. In my more than ten years of political life, I have never wronged anyone, nor have I ever conspired against anyone. But these five families have made every effort to destroy my political and family life completely,” Tej Pratap wrote on X.He further said, “Tomorrow (Friday), I will bring the faces and characters of all five families before the public. I am going to expose each of their conspiracies tomorrow.”On Wednesday, Tej Pratap had also posted, “Five people worked together to completely ruin my life... They could not tolerate my jovial nature and hence made such allegations to ruin my career. I will go to court and file a case too... I think these people took money from RSS and BJP and tried to tarnish my image because they saw that elections are coming and there is a craze among the youth for me.I will soon put the names of these people from five families in front of everyone. .. These conspirators have a gang from Patna to Delhi... They used to be in RJD but were expelled due to their misdeeds... These individuals have no other job except to be constantly active on social media, using it to tarnish the image of others...”Tej Pratap’s remarks come months after his father Lalu Prasad expelled him from the Rashtriya Janata Dal and “family” for six years in May, after a controversial Facebook post claimed he had been in a 12-year-long relationship with a woman named Anushka Yadav. Tej Pratap later alleged that his Facebook account had been hacked and that the post was part of a conspiracy against him.Following his expulsion, Tej Pratap launched a separate political outfit under the banner of ‘Team Tej Pratap Yadav’ and aligned with five smaller parties to contest the upcoming 2025 Bihar assembly elections. He has been campaigning aggressively across the state, often calling his rivals “Jaychand” (traitors).Lalu Prasad earlier in May had justified the expulsion by saying, “Ignoring moral values in personal life weakens our collective struggle for social justice. The actions, public conduct, and irresponsible behavior of my eldest son are not in accordance with our family’s principles. Therefore, under these circumstances, I am removing him from the party and the family.”Tej Pratap’s younger brother and leader of opposition in Bihar, Tejashwi Yadav, had said at the time that while the party would not tolerate such controversies, his brother was “an adult and free to make decisions.”",The elder son of RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav claimed he would soon reveal their identities.

Row Over Attack On Delhi CM Rekha Gupta, BJP Suspects Political Conspiracy By Rivals

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party 's state president Saurabh Bhardwaj on Thursday alleged that Delhi Police is withholding crucial CCTV footage related to the recent attack on chief minister Rekha Gupta during a public hearing at her Civil Lines camp office.Addressing reporters, the AAP leader said that while police promptly registered an FIR in Gupta’s case, similar seriousness was missing in earlier attacks on former chief minister Arvind Kejriwal ""We are glad that in Rekha Gupta's case, the police have registered an FIR, but I believe that the police are hiding the CCTV footage of the incident to cover up their failure,"" Bhardwaj said.He further recalled earlier incidents where Kejriwal was physically attacked during public events. “Before this, several attacks have been made on Arvind Kejriwal… While we haven’t seen CCTV footage of an attack on Rekha Gupta yet, attacks on Arvind Kejriwal were recorded and streamed everywhere.”The AAP leader alleged that police failed in their duty by not registering earlier attacks on Kejriwal as cases of attempt to murder and by not taking the accused into custody. According to him, those incidents were deliberately handled weakly, with lax security, and dismissed as acts of public anger — unlike the swift action taken in Gupta’s case.A day earlier, Bhardwaj had also expressed disappointment over the incident, stressing that violence has no place in society and goes against the principles of Mahatma Gandhi . He questioned the forces “patronising” violence, pointing out that it is not limited to attacks on political leaders but also includes instances where the police took violent action against SSC students and teachers.He also referred to a past incident when a BJP supporter attacked Arvind Kejriwal during an election campaign. At the time, Bhardwaj said, BJP leaders dismissed the attack as the act of a citizen upset with Kejriwal.""During an election program, a BJP supporter had attacked Arvind Kejriwal. At the time, the BJP said that the person was a civil defence volunteer who was upset with Arvind Kejriwal. Whenever there was an attack on Arvind Kejriwal, the BJP said that the people of Delhi were upset with him. We won't say that people of Delhi are upset with Rekha Gupta ji, and this is why an attack happened. An attack on anyone is wrong. We are supporting the BJP at this time as we believe that, in principle, violence is wrong, and all parties should condemn such an act,"" he said in a video message.The attack on Gupta took place on Wednesday morning during her weekly Jan Sunwai session. According to the Delhi CMO, the assault appeared to be part of a “well-planned conspiracy to kill her.” She was taken to hospital for a medical examination and later discharged.Police officials identified the accused as Rajesh Sakriya Khimjibhai, 41, a resident of Rajkot in Gujarat. He has been remanded to five-day police custody, with the Special Cell, Intelligence Bureau and local police jointly probing the case. Investigators are examining his phone and social media activity for possible links.","Aam Aadmi Party's state president Saurabh Bhardwaj alleged that Delhi Police is withholding crucial CCTV footage related to the recent attack on chief minister Rekha Gupta.

'No Big Deal If He is Tamil': DMK Blasts BJP's VP Choice CP Radhakrishnan As Political Appointment



A show of strength in Madurai:

Criticism of DMK government:

.



Tragedy on the way to the rally:

NEW DELHI: Actor-turned-politician and Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) president Vijay on Thursday declared that he would contest the 2026 Tamil Nadu assembly elections from Madurai East, launching a fiery attack on the ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and asserting that his party would emerge as the principal challenger in the polls.Addressing the party’s second state conference in Madurai, Vijay likened himself to a lion marking its territory. “A lion knows how to live in a crowd and also knows how to live alone. It remains unique. A lion comes out only to hunt, not for entertainment. It always hunts only living prey...,” he said, drawing massive support from thousands of party workers who had gathered for the rally.Vijay, who formed TVK in 2024, positioned the party as an alternative to both the DMK and the opposition AIADMK , but singled out the ruling party as his main political rival. “Our only ideological enemy is BJP, our only political enemy is DMK...TVK is not a party that was started just for some political benefits...” he said.The TVK chief asserted that his party was not just another entrant in Tamil Nadu politics but a force with a distinct mission. “TVK is not a political game; it is an ideology. This is not a speech for publicity. This is a warning to those who are in power. TVK is here to dominate.Crores of people are with us. The 2026 election is a fight between TVK and DMK,” he said.""TVK is not a party that makes underground deals, forges alliances, and cheats the people. We are not afraid of anyone. The people of Tamil Nadu, the women and the youth stand with us,"" he added.He also pledged that his party would champion larger Tamil causes, vowing to “free Katchatheevu island from Sri Lanka,” a long-standing political demand in the state.Referring to repeated clashes between Tamil Nadu fishermen and the Sri Lankan Navy, he said, “800 Tamil Nadu fishermen have been attacked by the Sri Lankan Navy. To ensure the safety of our fishermen, retrieve Katchatheevu (islands) and give them to us.”The Madurai rally was billed as TVK’s biggest political mobilisation yet, with party workers thronging the venue from across the state. This conference marks the party’s second since its inception and signals Vijay’s intent to enter the 2026 elections as a serious contender.The actor-politician has repeatedly compared the upcoming polls to the historic elections of 1967 and 1977, when newcomers—DMK under CN Annadurai and AIADMK under MG Ramachandran rose to power by defeating entrenched parties. Vijay, however, differs from these leaders as he has only recently entered active politics, despite being a popular figure since 2004.Last week, he launched the “Now TVK” mobile application to drive membership across Tamil Nadu. At the launch, he urged his cadre to follow Annadurai’s principle of living with the people, learning from them and planning with them.Vijay said the party’s priority is the safety of women, elders and children, adding that a TVK government would focus on supporting groups needing special attention, such as farmers, youth, transgender people, the elderly without care, and the physically challenged.He also stressed that TVK would not engage in secret deals, opportunistic alliances, or attempts to mislead the public. According to him, the party is unafraid of challenges and enjoys strong support from the people of Tamil Nadu, particularly women and youth.TVK president also accused DMK of having a secret alliance with the BJP. ""DMK has a secret alliance with the BJP, but does drama as if they are opposing the BJP,"" he said.Slamming the Centre, Vijay pointed out on the NEET issue. He said, ""Due of your stubbornness, you continue to impose the NEET exam, and it pains me to even speak about what is happening here because of it. NEET must be abolished. Will you do this? You will never give us what we want or do what is right for us.”Directly referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he asked: “Revoke NEET! Can you do it, Narendra Modi avargal?”Vijay has in recent months sharpened his criticism of chief minister MK Stalin ’s government. In a recent post on X, he condemned the arrest of sanitation workers protesting for their rights in Chennai, calling the action “inhumane and anarchic.” He alleged that the government was acting in a “fascist” manner against ordinary people.""Condemn the fascist DMK government for arresting sanitation workers, who have been peacefully fighting for their rights, in an inhumane and anarchic manner in the dead of night!"" Vijay wrote in a post on X.Even as the rally showcased TVK’s strength, it was marred by tragedy. Prabhakaran, a 33-year-old TVK worker from Chennai, collapsed on his way to Madurai to attend the event. He had travelled overnight with friends in a van and reportedly collapsed after stepping out near Chakkimangalam.His friends rushed him to the Madurai Government Rajaji Hospital, where doctors declared him dead. The hospital dean confirmed that he was brought in an unconscious state and was later declared dead.",Actor-turned-politician Vijay declares he will contest 2026 Tamil Nadu assembly elections from Madurai East.

"Whether President would seek SC opinion is her prerogative, says CJI",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/whether-president-would-seek-sc-opinion-is-her-prerogative-says-cji/articleshow/123440901.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: The Centre did not have to labour to persuade a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court on Thursday to recognise an apparent constitutional fallacy in the two-judge bench's April 8 virtual directive to the President to seek SC's opinion on constitutional validity of a bill reserved for her consideration by a governor.The constitution bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar appeared convinced by solicitor general Tushar Mehta's argument that the two-judge bench could not have used SC's Article 142 powers to step into the governor's shoes and grant deemed assent to 10 bills of Tamil Nadu.""These two directions - the President to seek opinion of SC and deemed assent - are fundamentally flawed and unconstitutional,"" Mehta said. SC fallaciously assumed that the President, the highest constitutional authority of India, lacks ability or wherewithal to ascertain constitutional validity of bills, which have been passed by an assembly but reserved for her consideration by the governor, he argued.CJI Gavai responded to his argument about such directions being hazardous for the stone-carved constitutional doctrine of separation of powers by saying, ""If all the bills reserved for the President's consideration become part of Presidential Reference, SC will do no other judicial work except giving advisory opinions as each Reference has to be addressed by a bench of minimum five judges.""A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan had on Apr 9 said whenever a bill is reserved for the President's consideration on the ground of its patent unconstitutionality, ""the President must be guided by the fact that it is the constitutional courts which have been entrusted with the responsibility of adjudicating upon the questions of constitutionality and legality of an executive or legislative action. Therefore, as a measure of prudence, the President ought to make a reference to this court in exercise of powers under Article 143 of the Constitution (and seek SC's opinion)"".Mehta told the bench to take example of a case where the President obtains such opinion from SC on the constitutional validity of a bill and grants assent. With bill thus becoming an Act, as in the case of the Tamil Nadu bills which have been published in the gazette mentioning that SC has granted deemed assent, how would an HC or SC adjudicate its validity given the fact that it has become a law after the SC had already vetted its constitutionally validity?Steering clear of the maze of consequential constitutional complications that would emerge if SC engaged in pre-law stage vetting of validity of bills, the CJI said, ""Whether the President would seek advisory opinion of SC under Article 143 is her sole prerogative.""Mehta said Article 142 powers, exclusively given to SC to do complete justice by acting within the constitutional and statutory parameters, cannot be used to assume the role of another coordinate constitutional authority like governor. He said the Constitution wherever needed has provided the 'deemed' provision, and hence, it prohibits SC from reading in 'deemed assent' provision into the Constitution using the powers it enjoys under Article 142.On the President's last question - whether states could invoke Article 32 right to directly move SC seeking a mandamus to governor, Mehta said any federal dispute involving Centre and state(s); or state(s) and state(s), must be resolved politically or in the alternative, a suit under Article 131 can be filed in SC.However, he said he would take instructions from the President, whether she would still press for an opinion from SC on this issue and inform the bench on Tuesday.",Five-judge bench of the Supreme Court appears to recognise apparent constitutional fallacy.

Local businesses brace for economic impact amid U.S. tariffs

Wayne Gretzky’s reputation caught in the crossfire

Brantford, Ontario, long celebrated as the hometown of hockey legend Wayne Gretzky, is now facing unexpected economic turbulence as U.S. tariffs on Canadian goods take effect. Local businesses, residents, and even Gretzky’s legacy are feeling the ripple effects of the trade measures announced by President Donald Trump.Graeme Roustan, owner of the historic Roustan Hockey company, expressed frustration at President Donald Trump's sudden trade restrictions. “It’s totally ridiculous. This business here has been in place for 178 years and it’s been selling product and trading product with the United States since before Canada was a country,” he said. With finished hockey sticks destined for U.S. customers facing a 25% tariff, Roustan and other manufacturers are rushing shipments to avoid extra costs.Brantford’s economy, tightly linked to cross-border trade, is especially vulnerable. Mayor Kevin Davis noted that some local businesses sell up to 80% of their products in the U.S., while also relying on American suppliers for raw materials.“There’ll be industries in Brantford that may shut down, they may reduce production, they may have to retool, and – for a year or two – not be producing much and employing less,” he warned.Despite this, Davis emphasized the city’s resilience: “You know, we’re nice until we’re not. And yeah, if you want a war, then it’s a war. But it’s a, it’s a totally meaningless war from my perspective.”Beyond economics, the tariffs have stirred controversy around Gretzky himself. Though long admired as Canada’s “Great One,” his public ties to Trump, including attending the inauguration and wearing a MAGA hat, have drawn criticism.Some Canadians have gone so far as to label him a “traitor” online. Local fans, however, remain measured. Rick Mannen, attending a game at the Wayne Gretzky Sports Centre, said, “I wish he would say to Donald ‘back off and treat Canada as a partner instead of trying to take over.’”Also Read: Wayne Gretzky’s daughter Paulina Gretzky enjoys Jason Derulo’s LIV Golf concert while teasing her own music future As Brantford navigates the fallout, many residents are turning to Canadian-made products, reflecting a renewed sense of local support. While the city faces challenges from the tariffs, its history of resilience and community pride remains strong, showing that even amidst political and economic uncertainty, Brantford continues to honor its iconic roots.In tense political times, can “The Great One” be both a Donald Trump supporter and a beloved hero in Canada? Some want him to pick a side.","Brantford, Ontario, long celebrated as the hometown of hockey legend Wayne Gretzky, is now facing unexpected economic turbulence as U.S. tariffs on Canadian goods take effect.

Filing error prompted judges' reaction in Janel Grant’s high-profile legal fight



The recent leak has broader implications in the Vince McMahon-linked lawsuit



The federal court dispute involving former WWE employee Janel Grant and physician Dr. Carlon Colker escalated this week after sensitive medical records appeared publicly online. The unredacted filing, briefly accessible on the federal docket Tuesday night, prompted swift intervention. By Wednesday, Judge Sarah F. Russell ordered the document sealed, citing the exposure of both Grant’s birth date and her confidential medical history. Although a redacted version followed, the private information had already been available to the public.The filing in question came from Dr. Carlon Colker’s legal team as part of his defamation lawsuit against Janel Grant’s attorney, Ann Callis. Colker claims Callis and her firm damaged his reputation with false statements about his treatment of Grant, who has separately accused Vince McMahon and WWE of trafficking and abuse. Grant alleges McMahon directed her to Colker’s Peak Wellness clinic, where she was given unnamed pills and intravenous treatments without clarity about their nature. Colker denies wrongdoing and stresses that he is not a defendant in the federal trafficking suit (per Brandon Thurston of Post Wrestling).To bolster their defamation claims, Colker’s attorneys included excerpts of Grant’s medical records in their brief. That decision quickly backfired. Judge Russell noted the document contained prohibited details: “a non-party’s [Grant’s] birth date” and “medical records that are the subject of an unopposed Motion to Seal.”In her order, she explained, “Given these circumstances, the court finds clear and compelling reasons to seal [Colker’s] response pending the filing of a redacted response. ”On Wednesday, Colker’s team submitted an updated version with the sensitive portions blacked out. So far, neither Colker’s counsel nor Grant’s representatives commented publicly.This courtroom mishap is only one thread in a wider legal web. Colker, represented by attorney Alejandro Brito, who also handles defamation cases for President Donald Trump, argues that Callis acted with “actual malice,” the legal threshold for defamation involving public figures. At the same time, his filings suggest he may challenge that classification, contending he is a private individual, which would lower the burden of proof.Colker’s team doubled down in their brief, insisting “even a cursory review of the medical records supports the notion of patient-initiated, informed, and consented treatments of Grant.” Callis, however, has maintained her statements were grounded in Grant’s own accounts and conditions.Also Read: Trish Stratus shares heartbreaking message as she announces her mother’s passing following long fight with cancer The dispute comes against the backdrop of Grant’s broader case against Vince McMahon and WWE, which alleges years of abuse and trafficking. Grant’s legal team has described lawsuits like Colker’s and delays in accessing her medical files as forms of retaliation. In Connecticut, Grant is also suing Colker and Peak Wellness to secure more records and communications that could shed light on her treatment and connections to McMahon.","Filing error prompted judges' reaction in Janel Grant’s high-profile legal fight.

US Tech Jobs Under Fire? Marjorie Greene Demand Ban On Indian Work Visas Amid Tariff Tensions





The United States will stop issuing worker visas for commercial truck drivers with immediate effect, Secretary of state Marco Rubio announced on Thursday.In a post on X, Rubio said the move was aimed at curbing the rise of foreign drivers on American roads. “The increasing number of foreign drivers operating large tractor-trailer trucks on US roads is endangering American lives and undercutting the livelihoods of American truckers,” he wrote.The decision followed last week’s deadly Florida crash involving Harjinder Singh, an Indian-origin driver who killed 3 people while making an illegal U-turn.Harjinder Singh was driving a semi truck on August 12 when he took a wrong U-turn which resulted in an accident involving a mini van. Two passengers, a 37-year-old woman from Pompano Beach and a 54-year-old man from Miami onboard the mini van, died at the scene.Federal officials said Singh entered the country illegally from Mexico and failed an English test after the accident. He has been charged with three counts of vehicular homicide.Florida’s Republican officials seized on the case, with the lieutenant governor personally flying to California to extradite Singh alongside federal agents.The incident has since escalated into a political flashpoint between President Donald Trump’s administration and Democratic-run California.Trump officials accused California Governor Gavin Newsom of responsibility as the state issued Singh a commercial license. Newsom’s office countered that Singh’s work permit was issued by the Trump administration itself, while California had fully cooperated in the extradition.Transportation secretary Sean Duffy said that the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration was investigating the Florida crash. He added that the government was enforcing stricter English proficiency requirements for truckers to improve road safety.Duffy said, ""This crash was a preventable tragedy directly caused by reckless decisions and compounded by despicable failures.""In April, Trump signed an executive order mandating English proficiency for all commercial drivers operating in the US. “Drivers should be able to read and understand traffic signs, communicate with officers, and give feedback to employers and customers in English,” the White House said at the time.Meanwhile, the State department confirmed it is vetting more than 55 million US visa holders for potential deportable offenses, including overstays, criminal activity and suspected terrorist links.","The United States will stop issuing worker visas for commercial truck drivers with immediate effect, Secretary of state Marco Rubio announced on Thursday.

‘Unlawful appointment’: Federal judge rules Alina Habba serving illegally; acting US attorney for NJ removed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/unlawful-appointment-federal-judge-rules-alina-habba-serving-illegally-acting-us-attorney-for-nj-removed/articleshow/123440889.cms,"Alina Habba (AP)





A federal judge ruled on Thursday that Alina Habba, former personal lawyer to US President Donald Trump, has been unlawfully serving as the acting US attorney for the district of New Jersey, according to news agency Reuters.US district judge Matthew Brann of the middle district of Pennsylvania determined that Habba’s interim period expired in July and that the administration’s effort to retain her through unconventional maneuvers violated federal law.Consequently, Brann ordered that Habba be disqualified from participating in ongoing cases and noted that actions she undertook since July 1 “may be declared void,” as quoted by the agency.The ruling follows legal challenges from two criminal defendants who argued that her appointment was invalid. As a result, plea hearings and sentencing proceedings were cancelled, and grand juries halted indictments amid the uncertainty over her authority.The Justice Department has already signaled it will appeal the decision. Officials argued that President Trump has broad authority to appoint her in a temporary capacity, with attorney general Pam Bondi supporting Habba’s reinstatement after her predecessor was dismissed, according to news agency AP.Legal experts warn that the ruling could have far‑reaching implications. It challenges the administration's broader strategy of retaining acting US attorneys using alternative legal mechanisms. Similar disputes are unfolding in other districts, including the Northern District of New York and Nevada.The case raises pressing questions over the legitimacy of executive‑branch maneuvers circumventing Senate confirmation in appointing top federal prosecutors.","Alina Habba, former personal lawyer to US President Donald Trump, has been unlawfully serving as the acting US attorney for the district of New Jersey.

Colorado dairy accident: Six workers killed in Weld County; gas exposure suspected,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/colorado-dairy-accident-six-workers-killed-in-weld-county-gas-exposure-suspected/articleshow/123443565.cms,"AI image





Six men lost their lives in a possible consequence of gas exposure at a large dairy farm in Weld County, Colorado, authorities confirmed on Thursday.The victims, all Hispanic males, were found inside a confined space at Prospect Valley Dairy near Keenesburg, around 35 miles northeast of Denver.According to news agency AP, chief deputy coroner for Weld County Jolene Weiner said investigators are treating the deaths as likely caused by toxic gas exposure. “We are investigating these deaths as the possible consequence of gas exposure in a confined space,” she said, adding that autopsies are planned to determine the exact cause.Fire crews were called to the farm on Wednesday evening for what was initially reported as a “confined space rescue.” Instead, they recovered the bodies, said Tom Beach, chief of the Southeast Weld Fire Protection District, as reported by the New York Times.Three other individuals were taken to the hospital but have since been released, as per NBC News.Officials emphasised that there was no sign of criminal activity. “It looks like an accident,” Weld County Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Melissa Chesmore said, while declining to elaborate on the precise circumstances.The US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has launched an investigation, according to the department of labour. Farming groups expressed shock. Dairy Farmers of America, which confirmed the site was one of its member farms, called it a “tragic accident,” offering condolences to the families of the deceased.The property, records show, is owned by Prospect Valley Dairy LLC, with a California-based address listed for its owners. The dairy includes a milking parlour of about 3,000 square metres and two free-stall barns, one nearly 42,000 square metres and another over 9,000.Keenesburg, the small town nearest to the farm, has about 2,000 residents, many of whom work in agriculture or the oil and gas sector. “We’re a very close-knit community. It’s mostly just farm fields,” mayor Aron Lam was quoted as saying by the New York Times.Farming is considered among the most dangerous occupations in the United States. As per by the New York Times, dairy workers in particular face risks from machinery, livestock, and toxic gases that accumulate in manure pits.Colorado has seen similar tragedies before: in 2021, an immigrant farmworker drowned after his truck overturned into a manure lagoon at another dairy farm in La Salle.Weiner confirmed that the names of the six victims are being withheld until families are notified.","Victims were found inside a confined space at Prospect Valley Dairy near Keenesburg, around 35 miles northeast of Denver.

Alligator Alcatraz: Judge orders Florida to stop expansion of controversial detention site in Everglades; cites environmental damage,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/alligator-alcatraz-judge-orders-florida-to-stop-expansion-of-controversial-detention-site-in-everglades-cites-environmental-damage/articleshow/123444590.cms,"Alligator Alcatraz: Judge orders Florida to stop expansion of controversial detention site in Everglades (Picture credit: AP)





A federal judge has blocked further expansion of Florida’s immigration detention facility in the Everglades, known as “Alligator Alcatraz,” ruling that it violated environmental laws and ordering that much of the facility be dismantled.US district Judge Kathleen Williams issued the preliminary injunction on Thursday, formalising an earlier temporary order.Her 82-page ruling bars state and federal officials from bringing in new detainees, restricts activity at the compound to safety repairs only, and directs the removal of fencing, lighting and generators once the population is transferred within 60 days.She also prohibited any new construction at the site, reported The New York Times.“What is apparent, however, is that in their haste to construct the detention camp, the State did not consider alternative locations,” Williams wrote, as cited by news agency AP, adding that the facility would have “considerable environmental impacts” on the protected wetlands.She warned the project risked “irreparable harm in the form of habitat loss and increased mortality to endangered species in the area,” including the Florida panther, and threatened water supplies for communities dependent on the Everglades, according to the NYT.The detention centre, erected two months ago on an old airstrip in Big Cypress National Preserve near the border with Everglades National Park, currently holds several hundred detainees but was intended to house up to 3,000 in large white tents ringed by chain-link fencing.Inside, rows of bunk beds sit in sweltering tents where detainees have complained of worms in food, broken toilets flooding floors, mosquitoes, limited access to showers and medicines, and sudden air-conditioning failures, reported AP.Environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe, who filed the lawsuit, argued the project threatens endangered wildlife and risks polluting wetlands through runoff. “This brutal detention centre was burning a hole in the fabric of life that supports our most iconic wetland,” said Elise Bennett of the Centre for Biological Diversity, as quoted by The Washington Post.Eve Samples of Friends of the Everglades hailed the ruling as “a landmark victory… It sends a clear message that environmental laws must be respected by leaders at the highest levels of our government.”Miccosukee Tribe Chairman Talbert Cypress added, “We will always stand up for our culture, our sovereignty, and for the Everglades,” reported AP.Williams ruled that federal agencies should have carried out a full environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act, despite the state’s claim that federal law did not apply because Florida was leading construction. She noted the facility operated under federal immigration enforcement standards and funding, making it a joint venture. “If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, and looks like a duck, then it’s a duck,” she wrote, according to NYT.Governor Ron DeSantis, who has defended the camp as part of Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, immediately appealed the decision. His spokesman Alex Lanfranconi said, “The deportations will continue until morale improves.” The governor has also pushed plans for a second immigration detention site in North Florida, dubbed “Deportation Depot,” reported AP.According to Politico, Florida’s top emergency management official Kevin Guthrie also filed a notice of appeal Thursday night. DeSantis, anticipating the defeat, had earlier accused Williams of bias, “It’s pretty clear we’re in front of a judge who is not going to give us a fair shake on this,” he said Tuesday.The ruling represents a significant victory for environmentalists. Williams noted that since President Harry Truman’s 1947 dedication of Everglades National Park, every Florida governor and national leader has pledged support for its protection. “This order does nothing more than uphold the basic requirements of legislation designed to fulfil those promises,” she wrote.","Judge orders Florida to stop expansion of controversial detention site in Everglades.

War Of Words Erupts As PM Modi’s Independence Day Praise For RSS Draws Fire From BJP, Congress

RAIPUR: A young villager who was killed by Maoists in a ‘jan adalat' in the Bastar region was not murdered for the usual suspicion of being a police informer, but allegedly for hoisting the national flag on a Maoists' memorial and singing the national anthem with students and villagers on the spot.When dozens of remote villages in the Red zone of the Bastar division witnessed the Tiranga fluttering for the first time since independence, Maoists with clenched teeth were possibly seeking a reason to attack the villagers.A young villager, Manesh Nureti, 28, was killed in a ‘jan adalat' of Maoists on Monday, which was initially reported as a killing after he was accused of working as a police informer. However, villagers who attended the ‘jan adalat' on that day, having been summoned by Maoists to appear in the ‘adalat', recounted the horrific story at a weekly market at Chhotebethiyha on Thursday.""Manesh Nureti had called upon children, school students and villagers to gather at a place close to the primary school where Maoists had erected their memorial. All of us gathered happily and celebrated Independence Day, singing the national anthem. Then Nureti hoisted the flag on Maoists' memorial—the red pillar established in memory of deceased cadres,"" a villager narrated before a security personnel deployed at the weekly market.Eventually, other locals also gathered and said, ""His fault was to put Tiranga on the pillar. Maoists had rebuked him during jan adalat. The video of the event was accessed by Maoists and they summoned villagers inside the forest. Nureti was pointed out and was sentenced to death in front of hundreds of villagers.""The villagers of Konge panchayat did not speak any further, a security personnel from the spot told TOI.Police are yet to officially get details and confirmation about the sequence of the incident and how Nureti was killed or if the body was handed over to family.Kanker SP Indira Kalyan Elesela said, ""We haven't heard from Nureti's family, they have closed themselves up and are inaccessible. Police are trying to find out if the celebration of a national event was the trigger point. As far as we know, Nureti was a progressive person who was interested in development of the region.""Nureti had studied till Class XII in a residential school and was contributing as a teacher for school students.After a violent act by Maoists, villagers go into hibernation and do not open up. Even if they have lost a beloved family member, they would be forced to say, ""but he died of snakebite.""Binagunda village, which apparently witnessed flag hoisting for the first time since independence, is located on the borders of Kanker and Narayanpur districts in the Bastar division. It was a special day on Aug 15, because this region had earlier seen only black flags and Maoist banners, leaflets warning villagers not to observe the national event, but this time, they were excited to see arrangements being made for flag hoisting.The wooden Maoist memorial was recently put up by the cadres of the north Bastar division and Partapur area committee during their ‘shaheedi saptah' (martyrs week).Binagunda and surrounding forests and villages were among the worst Maoist-affected places in Bastar until April 2024, when security forces killed 29 Maoists in a single encounter. Those killed included senior rank cadres too.","Manesh Nureti, 28, was killed in a ‘jan adalat' of Maoists on Monday.

A Huge crowd gather at Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam's conference 'Maanadu', in Madurai on Thursday.

Actor and founder of Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK), Vijay addresses the gathering during the party's conference 'Maanadu', in Madurai on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: A sea of supporters thronged Madurai on Thursday as actor-turned-politician Vijay led Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam’s (TVK) second state conference, marking the party’s biggest show of strength yet.The massive turnout set the tone for TVK’s push to establish itself as a formidable third front in Tamil Nadu politics, ahead of the 2026 assembly elections.Addressing cadres amid thunderous applause, Vijay sharpened his attack on both the ruling DMK and the opposition AIADMK while positioning TVK as the “true alternative” for the state.Taking repeated jibes at chief minister MK Stalin, whom he referred to as “Stalin uncle,” Vijay accused DMK of hypocrisy on issues ranging from women’s safety to its changing stance on the BJP. “You ask women to call you appa (father), but there is no safety for women themselves,” he charged, before telling Stalin to “hear the noise of the people.”On the Centre, the TVK chief directed pointed questions at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, demanding clarity on whether his third term was meant “to do good for the people or to plot something against the Muslim community.”He pressed the Union government to retrieve Katchatheevu island, withdraw NEET, and resolve the plight of Tamil fishermen detained by the Sri Lankan navy.Without naming AIADMK, Vijay accused BJP of using the party once nurtured by M G Ramachandran as a “backdoor to enter Tamil Nadu,” adding that even its cadres were disillusioned. He pledged that TVK would remain “truly secular” and never enter into a hidden alliance with BJP.Vijay, who has often been compared with leaders such as Annadurai and M G Ramachandran, told supporters that TVK had already created “ripples” in state politics.“Many said I will not enter politics, then that I will not get support, then that I cannot conduct a conference. Now they say I cannot win elections. To those analysts, I say — this crowd is not just support, we have already entered every household in the state,” he declared.In a surprise announcement, Vijay confirmed he would contest from Madurai East in 2026. At the same time, he symbolically declared himself a contestant in all 234 constituencies, telling supporters to treat every TVK candidate as if he himself were in the fray.“A lion comes to the ground only to hunt, not to pass time. Even if it is single, it will be the king of the jungle,” he said, hailing his cadres as “lion cubs” and TVK as an “army of common people.”The rally ended on a symbolic note, with Vijay singing an MGR song from Enga Veetu Pillai and urging people to “take the whip of politics” against both BJP and DMK. Stressing that governance under TVK would prioritise women, youth, farmers, fisherfolk, weavers, the disabled and transpersons, he promised to build a party rooted in people’s welfare rather than political expediency.","Actor Vijay's Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) held a massive state conference in Madurai, signaling its ambition to become a significant political force in Tamil Nadu.

European leaders back deployment



Trump pushes for quick end







Military leaders from the United States and key European allies have drawn up options for providing security guarantees to Ukraine, officials confirmed on Thursday, marking a significant step in ongoing efforts to end Russia’s nearly four-year war.According to a report from Reuters, the proposals were presented to national security advisers from both sides of the Atlantic after US President Donald Trump pledged to help protect Ukraine as part of any settlement with Moscow. A Pentagon statement said US and European planners had developed military options for “appropriate consideration,” following a Reuters report that first revealed the deliberations.The chiefs of defence from the US, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the UK, and Ukraine met in Washington between Tuesday and Thursday to hash out potential strategies. According to Reuters, sources said discussions focused on how Europe could take the lead in any deployment, with the US likely playing a supporting role.US secretary of state and national security Adviser Marco Rubio later held a conference call with his European counterparts, including UK national security adviser Jonathan Powell, the European Commission president’s chief of cabinet Bjoern Seibert, Nato secretary general’s chief of staff Geoffrey van Leeuwen, and senior officials from France, Germany, Italy, and Finland.While plans remain fluid, officials suggested European countries would bear the bulk of responsibility for forces deployed in Ukraine — a position echoed by US Vice President JD Vance on Wednesday. “The planning work continues,” one source said, adding that Washington is still “determining the scope of its role.”Trump has ruled out deploying US ground troops but signalled openness to other forms of military support, such as command-and-control oversight or US airpower. Options under consideration reportedly include supplying additional air defence systems, deploying fighter jets to enforce a no-fly zone, and placing US officers in charge of European contingents, according to Reuters.French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer have both endorsed the idea of a European-led peacekeeping force, while German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has expressed cautious support. However, Germany’s powerful soldiers’ union warned Thursday that Nato leaders must face the reality that tens of thousands of troops would be required for any long-term mission in Ukraine.The US president has repeatedly pressed for a rapid end to what he has called “Europe’s war,” raising concerns in Kyiv and among allies that Washington might push for a settlement on Russia’s terms. Still, the flurry of military planning underscores the seriousness with which Western leaders are preparing for potential security guarantees, should a ceasefire or broader peace deal be reached.","Military leaders from the United States and key European allies have drawn up options for providing security guarantees to Ukraine.

A strong earthquake with a revised magnitude of 7.5 struck the Drake Passage on Thursday, shaking the remote region between South America and Antarctica but posing no widespread tsunami threat, according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center.Initially reported as an 8.0 magnitude event, the US Geological Survey (USGS) later downgraded the quake and confirmed it occurred at a shallow depth of 11 kilometers (7 miles). The epicenter was located over 700 kilometers (435 miles) southeast of Ushuaia, Argentina — the southernmost city in the country with a population of approximately 57,000.The quake struck at 4:16 PM HST on August 21 (07:46 AM IST on August 22).While the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center briefly issued a warning for parts of the Chilean coast, it later confirmed there was no tsunami threat to Hawaii or other distant areas.Chile’s Navy Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service also issued a tsunami alert for its Antarctic territory after the quake, noting the epicenter was about 258 kilometers (160 miles) northwest of the Chilean Base Frei research station.There have been no reports of damage or casualties, largely due to the remote nature of the area.","A strong earthquake with a revised magnitude of 7.5 struck the Drake Passage on Thursday, shaking the remote region between South America and Antarctica.

Brazil's Bolsonaro faces fresh allegations: Ex-president received $ 5mn over a year - money laundering case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/brazils-bolsonaro-faces-fresh-allegations-ex-president-received-5mn-over-a-year-money-laundering-case/articleshow/123442998.cms,"Jair Bolsonaro (Pic credit: ANI)





Brazilian federal police have accused former president Jair Bolsonaro of receiving more than 30 million reais ($5 million) without apparent justification between March 2023 and February 2024.According to investigators, Brazil’s financial watchdog suspects a case of money laundering involving Bolsonaro. They allege Bolsonaro received the funds, most of them without clear justification, while recording nearly equivalent debits during the same period, reported AP.Almost 20 million reais ($3.48 million) allegedly came from more than 1.2 million PIX transactions. Investigators said Bolsonaro spent similar amounts on investments, as well as on wire transfers, withdrawals, deposit slips and exchange operations.New documents, sent to the Supreme Court, are added to a 170-page obstruction investigation undertaken by Brazilian federal police. Police report included text exchanges, voice messages, and documents seized during investigations.The disclosures emerged from messages found on Bolsonaro’s telephone. The report said Bolsonaro had prepared a request for asylum addressed to Argentine President Javier Milei, dated February 10, 2024.The former president is already set to face the verdict and sentencing phase in early September in his trial over an alleged coup plot. He could also face a fresh trial if the attorney general decides to pursue obstruction-of-justice charges.The federal police further alleged that Bolsonaro and his son Eduardo used “several maneuvers to dissimulate the origin and destination of financial resources, with the aim of financing and supporting activities of illegal nature of the lawmaker (Eduardo Bolsonaro) living abroad.”Bolsonaro did not immediately comment on the new accusations. He has previously claimed he is the target of political persecution by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s government. His lawyers earlier expressed surprise at the federal police’s move to formally accuse him of obstruction of justice.","Jair Bolsonaro accused of receiving more than 30 million reais ($5 million) between March 2023 and February 2024.

California is set to act fast after Texas advances congressional maps to boost Republicans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/california-is-set-to-act-fast-after-texas-advances-congressional-maps-to-boost-republicans/articleshow/123443043.cms,"



SACRAMENTO: The national tit-for-tat redistricting battle entered its next phase Thursday as California Democrats launched their final legislative push to redraw their congressional map to add up to five winnable seats for their party, a direct counter to the Texas House's approval of a new map to create more conservative-leaning seats in that state.California's Democratic-controlled Legislature opened debate on a package to revise the map and place it in front of voters for final approval in a special November election. The election is necessary because California Democrats must override their state's voter-approved nonpartisan commission that drew the existing congressional map.""We don't want this fight and we didn't choose this fight, but with our democracy on the line, we will not run away from this fight,"" Democratic Assemblyman Marc Berman said to kick off debate.Gov. Gavin Newsom engineered the high-risk strategy in response to President Donald Trump's own brinkmanship. Trump pushed Texas Republicans to reopen the legislative maps they passed in 2021 to squeeze out up to five new GOP seats to help the party stave off a midterm defeat in 2026.California Assemblyman James Gallagher, the Republican minority leader, said Trump was ""wrong"" to push for new Republican seats elsewhere, contending he was just responding to Democratic gerrymandering in other states.But he warned that Newsom's approach, which the governor has dubbed ""fight fire with fire,"" was dangerous.""You move forward fighting fire with fire and what happens?"" Gallagher asked. ""You burn it all down.""In Texas, passage by the Republican-controlled state Senate and the signature of Republican Gov. Greg Abbott are now all that's needed to make the maps official.California faces a more uncertain route. Democrats must use their legislative supermajority to pass the map by a two-third margin. Then they must schedule the special election that Newsom must approve by Friday to meet ballot deadlines.Texas Democratic lawmakers, vastly outnumbered in that state's Legislature, delayed approval of the new map by 15 days by leaving Texas this month in protest. They were assigned round-the-clock police monitoring upon their return to ensure they attended Wednesday's session.That session ended with an 88-52 party-line vote approving the map. Democrats have also vowed to challenge the new Texas map in court and complained that Republicans made the political power move before passing legislation responding to deadly floods that swept the state last month.A battle for the US House control waged via redistricting In a sign of Democrats' stiffening redistricting resolve, former President Barack Obama has backed Newsom's bid to redraw the California map, saying it was a necessary step to stave off the GOP's Texas move.""I think that approach is a smart, measured approach,"" Obama said Tuesday during a fundraiser for the Democratic Party's main redistricting arm.The incumbent president's party usually loses congressional seats in the midterm election. On a national level, the partisan makeup of existing districts puts Democrats within three seats of a majority.Trump is going beyond Texas as he tries to ensure Republicans maintain their House majority. He's pushed Republican leaders in states such as Indiana and Missouri to pursue redistricting. Ohio Republicans were already revising their map before Texas moved. Democrats, meanwhile, are mulling reopening Maryland's and New York's maps.However, more Democratic-run states have commission systems like California's or other redistricting limits than Republican ones do, leaving the GOP with a freer hand to swiftly redraw maps. New York, for example, can't draw new maps until 2028, and even then, only with voter approval.Texas Republicans openly said they were acting in their party's interest. State Rep. Todd Hunter, who wrote the legislation creating the new map, noted that the U.S. Supreme Court has allowed politicians to redraw districts for nakedly partisan purposes.Because the Supreme Court has blessed purely partisan gerrymandering, the only way opponents can stop the new Texas map would be by arguing it violates the Voting Rights Act requirement to keep minority communities together so they can select representatives of their choice.",California Democrats want to redraw their congressional map to add up to five winnable seats for their party. It's a direct counter to the Texas House's approval of a new map to create more conservative-leaning seats.

‘You’ve got to be yourself’: JD Vance hits out at Newsom for imitating ‘Trump-style’ posts; says Democrats need authenticity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/youve-got-to-be-yourself-jd-vance-hits-out-at-newsom-for-imitating-trump-style-posts-says-democrats-need-authenticity/articleshow/123422047.cms,"File photo: US Vice President JD Vance (right) and California Governor Gavin Newsom (Picture credit: AP)





US Vice President JD Vance on Wednesday ridiculed California Governor Gavin Newsom for imitating President Donald Trump ’s social media style, calling the approach inauthentic and unlikely to help Democrats win over voters.Speaking on Fox News’s The Ingraham Angle, Vance dismissed the strategy as misguided. “This idea that Gavin Newsom is somehow going to mimic Donald Trump’s style, I think that ignores the fundamental genius of President Trump’s political success, which is that he’s authentic,” Vance said.“He just is who he is,” Vance added. “You’ve got to be yourself. You’ve got to talk to people honestly about the issues.”Newsom, considered a potential 2028 Democratic presidential contender, has in recent weeks rolled out a new online strategy that mirrors Trump’s distinctive approach, long, capitalised rants, dismissive nicknames for rivals, boasts about his policies, and posts laced with exclamation marks.According to the New York Times, his press office X account, which once shared routine policy updates, has transformed into a parody of Trump’s Truth Social feed, branding him “AMERICA’S MOST FAVORITE GOVERNOR.”The change comes amid Democrats’ post-2024 election soul-searching, with some party figures arguing they need a sharper, Trump-like tone to compete. Vance, however, urged them to rethink. “Some free political advice from the president of the United States, stop sounding like crazy people,” he said.“Don’t be a crazy person. Be authentic. If the Democrats did that, they’d do a hell of a lot better.”Vance also pointed to what he called the success of Trump’s federal crime crackdown in Washington, DC, where the president declared a public safety emergency on 11 August.According to the vice president, violent crime dropped 35% and robberies fell 55% in just nine days. “These numbers highlight that law and order is a question of political will,” he told Fox News. “If you’ve got the political will to enforce the law, you can make even cities like DC safe again.”Newsom, for his part, has defended his mocking online style. He argued it is a deliberate attempt to expose Trump’s rhetoric by reflecting it back. “If you’ve got issues with what I’m putting out, you sure as hell should have concerns about what he’s putting out as president,” the governor recently said, as reported by the New York Times.His office has continued with the approach after seeing a surge in online engagement, with follower numbers climbing significantly this month.While some Democrats have embraced the strategy as “fighting fire with fire,” critics say it risks looking childish. Conservative commentator Tomi Lahren recently declared that Newsom had “embarrassed himself” to the point of being disqualified from higher office.Vance’s blunt message, however, was that no amount of theatrics can replace policy. “Gavin Newsom can mimic Donald Trump all that he wants to, but they’re still going to lose unless they get better policies that actually serve the American people”.",US Vice President JD Vance ridiculed California Governor Gavin Newsom for imitating President Donald Trump ’s social media style.

Former US President Barack Obama has thrown his weight behind California Governor Gavin Newsom’s push to redraw House districts, calling the plan a “responsible” way to counter Republican efforts in Texas.Speaking at a Martha’s Vineyard fundraiser on Tuesday, Obama said he admired Newsom’s decision to link California’s proposed changes to Republican-led redistricting elsewhere.“He said this is going to be responsible. We’re not going to try to completely maximise it. We’re only going to do it if and when Texas and/or other Republican states begin to pull these manoeuvres,” Obama remarked, according to the New York Times.The former president, who raised $2 million for the National Democratic Redistricting Committee at the event, added that while he disliked gerrymandering,Democrats could not “unilaterally allow one of the two major parties to rig the game.” He warned, “If we don’t respond effectively, then this White House and Republican-controlled state governments all across the country, they will not stop, because they do not appear to believe in this idea of an inclusive, expansive democracy.”Newsom has proposed a November ballot measure, labelled Proposition 50, that would allow Democrats to bypass California’s independent redistricting commission and enact a party-drawn map.The plan, which he nicknamed the “Election Rigging Response Act,” would only be triggered if Texas or another Republican state pushes through mid-decade changes. If passed, it could reshape five districts currently held by Republicans, boosting Democrats in the 2026 midterms.Obama reinforced that his support was conditional. “Over the long term, we shouldn’t have political gerrymandering in America, just a fair fight between Republicans and Democrats based on who’s got better ideas,” he wrote separately on X on Wednesday.“But since Texas is taking direction from a partisan White House and gerrymandering in the middle of a decade to try and maintain the House despite their unpopular policies, I have tremendous respect for how Governor Newsom has approached this”, he further wrote.Newsom, widely seen as a possible 2028 presidential contender, thanked the former president on Wednesday. “Thank you President Obama for backing Proposition 50 and standing up for America’s democracy,” he posted on X.The redistricting clash has intensified since US President Donald Trump urged Texas leaders to redraw maps in a way that could eliminate five Democratic-held seats.Republican lawmakers in Texas approved the redrawn maps on Wednesday, intensifying the battle over control of the House. In response, Democrats in California, Illinois and New York are weighing counter-moves. Reacting to the Texas bill, Newsom posted on X: “It’s on. See you in November.”According to the LA Times, California lawmakers are expected to vote soon on whether to call the special election.Obama acknowledged the tension between his long-standing opposition to gerrymandering and his present stance.“I wanted just a fair fight … but California is one of the states that has the capacity to offset a large state like Texas,” he told donors, describing Newsom’s approach as a “smart, measured” solution tailored to “a very particular problem in a very particular moment in time.”","Former US President Barack Obama has thrown his weight behind California Governor Gavin Newsom's push to redraw House districts.

Hurricane Erin’s outer bands brushed North Carolina’s Outer Banks, prompting Highway 12 closure

NHC warned of “life-threatening surf and currents,” storm surge and flooding across US East coast

Evacuations began in Outer Banks; NY, NJ closed beaches as Erin churned northward.





The National Hurricane Center (NHC) warned of “life-threatening surf and currents” along much of the US East coast as Hurricane Erin’s outer bands brushed North Carolina on Wednesday evening.A storm surge warning was issued for Cape Lookout to Duck, North Carolina, while a tropical storm warning was in effect from Beaufort Inlet to Chincoteague, Virginia, including the Pamlico and Albemarle sounds.The NHC advisory at 8 pm ET said hurricane-force winds extended outward up to 105 miles from the storm’s center, with tropical-storm-force winds reaching 265 miles.Hurricane Erin, now a Category 2 hurricane, was not forecast to make landfall in the US. However, ""storm surge will be accompanied by large waves, leading to significant beach erosion and overwash,"" has put beaches in the Bahamas, Bermuda, Atlantic Canada, and the US East Coast at risk.The National Weather Service cautioned that waves could exceed 10 feet in the region. Coastal flood warnings were in place for parts of Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, and along the bay south of the York River.Erin had earlier intensified to Category 5 on Saturday before weakening to Category 3 on Sunday morning. It regained strength later that day, with satellite data and a US Air Force Hurricane Hunter mission showing improved organization.Forecasters expected slow strengthening through Thursday night.North Carolina Governor Josh Stein declared a state of emergency on Tuesday to mobilise resources and assist evacuations in the Outer Banks. Low-lying tourist areas were already being cleared.Precautionary measures extended to the Northeast. New York Mayor Eric Adams announced all city beaches would remain closed for swimming on Wednesday and Thursday “due to dangerous riptides from Hurricane Erin.” New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy also urged residents and visitors to avoid the ocean, citing hazardous currents and high surf.On Tuesday, Erin’s slow northward movement had already unleashed rough surf and dangerous rip currents along the East Coast, triggering dozens of water rescues, swimming bans, and beach closures.","Hurricane Erin's outer bands brush North Carolina's Outer Banks.

A fire aboard the USS New Orleans, a US Navy amphibious transport dock ship anchored off Okinawa, raged for nearly 12 hours before being brought under control early Thursday, leaving two sailors with minor injuries.The blaze began around 4 pm (local time) on Wednesday while the warship was anchored near the White Beach Naval Facility, the Navy’s 7th Fleet said in a statement. The New Orleans, commissioned in 2007, carries a crew of more than 360 sailors and is capable of transporting up to 800 troops.According to CNN, the US Navy confirmed that two sailors were treated for minor injuries in onboard medical facilities. The fire was declared out early Thursday, though Japan’s Coast Guard said efforts continued until after 9 am (local time) and that an investigation was underway to ensure the flames were fully extinguished.The New Orleans crew was assisted by firefighters from the USS San Diego, also stationed at White Beach, while the Japan Coast Guard, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, and other US Navy commands on Okinawa provided “critical support,” the Navy said.As per news agency AFP, four Japanese vessels, including coast guard, navy, and private contractor ships, spent the night spraying water on the blaze.Images broadcast by NHK showed tugboats dousing the ship’s bow with water.The cause of the fire remains under investigation. The Navy said the New Orleans crew will remain aboard the vessel.Naval analyst Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain, was quoted by CNN as saying that the scale of the blaze shows the service needs to revisit its prevention and firefighting protocols. He warned that damage could leave the ship inactive for 60 to 120 days. “A fire of that extent used to be rare on US Navy warships,” he said.The incident has revived memories of the 2020 disaster aboard the USS Bonhomme Richard, when a blaze in San Diego burned for more than four days, leaving the ship beyond repair. A subsequent Navy investigation cited systemic failures in maintenance, training, and oversight.The US maintains around 54,000 military personnel in Japan, most based in Okinawa.","Two sailors injured as USS New Orleans burns for 12 hours near Okinawa.

Joe Francescon, a former defense and national security official in the first Trump administration, has been appointed as the new deputy director of the national security agency (NSA), news portal Politico reported on Thursday.The announcement comes months after a major leadership overhaul at the NSA, which included the dismissal of former deputy Wendy Noble and NSA-cyber command head general Timothy Haugh. Francescon's appointment does not require Senate confirmation.Director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and defense secretary Pete Hegseth confirmed the appointment in a joint statement, saying, “with his wealth of experience countering foreign threats, Joe is exceptionally qualified to lead the next generation of American cybersecurity experts, spearheading efforts to outmaneuver evolving threats and counter our adversaries,” as quoted by the portal.Francescon, who previously served over a decade as an intelligence analyst at the NSA, also held roles in the Pentagon and the national security council between 2018 and 2020. He is currently the chief external affairs officer at defense contractor DZYNE Technologies.In his statement, Francescon said he was “deeply honored and filled with excitement to return home” to the NSA, adding, “I am eager to lead NSA’s exceptional team in safeguarding our nation and countering global threats to protect the American people.”His appointment follows the controversial firing of his predecessor and general Haugh by President Donald Trump, reportedly after a meeting with far-right activist Laura Loomer at the White House. While no official explanation was given for the dismissals, Loomer posted on X that both officials were “disloyal to President Trump,” citing their prior appointments under Biden and Obama administrations.Lt Gen William Hartman has been serving as acting NSA and cyber command head since the leadership shake-up. It remains unclear whether he will be formally nominated for the dual-hat role, which requires Senate confirmation.Francescon’s appointment is seen as part of the Trump administration’s broader efforts to install trusted figures in senior national security roles.","Joe Francescon, a former defense and national security official in the first Trump administration, has been appointed as the new deputy director of the national security agency.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s Supreme Court granted bail on Thursday to jailed former prime minister and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chief Imran Khan in eight cases linked to the May 9, 2023 violence, when his supporters stormed government buildings and military installations after his brief detention.The relief, however, offers little respite to the PTI founder. Khan, in prison for more than two years, remains behind bars in the £190 million Al-Qadir Trust graft case, while several other corruption and terrorism-related trials remain pending against him.Khan was first jailed in Aug 2023 in a case involving the sale of state gifts. An anti-terrorism court later refused him bail in cases connected to the May 9 riots, and on June 24 the Lahore high court also dismissed his plea, prompting him to challenge the decision in the Supreme Court.The top court’s order comes days after army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir’s remarks in Brussels stirred a storm back home. Munir was quoted as saying that Khan should “apologise for the May 9 violence, sit silently in Banigala (his residence in Islamabad), and let the present system complete its term”.The comments sparked a furious backlash from PTI’s large social media base, which sees Khan’s continued incarceration as part of a wider military-led effort to crush the party.Party leaders said the remarks were proof that Khan’s legal battles are being dictated not in courtrooms but from Rawalpindi.Political observers say the episode underscores Pakistan’s enduring civil-military imbalance. Once considered close to the establishment, Khan has emerged as its most vocal critic since his ouster in April 2022. His confrontation with Munir is now seen as the defining contest in Pakistan’s power struggle, overshadowing judicial proceedings and parliamentary debates.“The message is clear – Khan will only be allowed political space if he apologises and withdraws from active politics,” a senior analyst in Islamabad said. “This is less about legal cases and more about forcing him into silence.”Khan’s supporters, meanwhile, hailed Thursday’s court ruling as a moral victory. But with his convictions intact and multiple cases still hanging over him, the former prime minister remains far from freedom.","Pakistan’s Supreme Court granted bail on Thursday to jailed former prime minister and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chief Imran Khan.

At least 25 people, including some in critical condition, were injured after an explosion took place at a fireworks storage facility in Karachi, Pakistan.Thick smoke could be seen billowing into the sky from the building where firecrackers were stored, according to television footage.Witnesses cited by AP said that broken glass from nearby shops covered the road and panicked residents fled the scene.Firefighters rushed to extinguish the blaze while ambulances ferried the injured, including passers-by, to hospitals.Senior police official Asad Raza said several shops and vehicles on Jinnah Road were damaged in the blast. The cause of the explosion was not immediately known.The fire was reported in a warehouse near Taj Complex on MA Jinnah Road, a Rescue 1122 spokesperson said, adding,“as soon as Rescue 1122’s Central Command and Control team received the information, the Fire and Rescue team reached the scene along with an ambulance and two fire brigade trucks.”Police surgeon Summaiya Syed told Dawn, “Sixteen injured at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre [with] two critical. Fourteen at Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Trauma Centre,” adding that the warehouse had been storing firecrackers.Karachi traffic police said MA Jinnah Road had been closed due to the fire, with traffic from Numaish being diverted towards Society Signal and Ali Raza Imambargah.Citizens were advised to call the Traffic Police helpline at 1915 for alternate routes “to avoid inconvenience,” the Dawn reported.Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and directed officials to control the blaze and ensure no lives were lost. According to a statement, he also ordered the Karachi Commissioner to provide immediate medical assistance to the injured and submit a detailed report. “There is no permission to produce materials near cities or populated areas which can cause damage,” CM Murad was quoted as saying.The Sindh home ministry later issued a statement saying 20 people had been injured in the blaze.Home minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar directed police reinforcements to the scene, saying, “Police reinforcements should be sent to rescue the injured and transfer them quickly to the nearest hospital. An investigation must be completed and a report submitted soon.”Lanjar also instructed investigators to include statements from the injured and evidence from the scene, Dawn furthed added.Explosions at fireworks facilities are not uncommon in Pakistan. In January, six people were killed in a similar blast at a fireworks storage site in Mandi Bahauddin, Punjab province. Fires in commercial and residential buildings are also frequent, largely blamed on poor infrastructure, weak enforcement of safety rules, and negligence.","At least 25 people, including some in critical condition, injured after explosion at fireworks storage facility in Karachi, Pakistan. Firefighters rushed to extinguish the blaze while ambulances ferried the injured, including passers-by, to hospitals.

Targeting Ahmadiyya community



Blasphemy accusations







The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has raised alarm over violence against minority communities in the country.HRCP on Thursday released its latest report, Streets of Fear: Freedom of Religion or Belief in 2024/25, documenting violations of freedom of religion or belief (FORB) between 1 July 2024 and 30 June 2025.The report painted a picture as grim as in previous years, recording targeted killings, forced conversions, mob lynchings, hate speech, desecration of places of worship and extrajudicial killings. It also warned that religious freedom in Pakistan is facing an unprecedented threat.The HRCP highlighted several cases where individuals were killed over blasphemy accusations, describing the trend as deeply troubling in a country that has already witnessed the assassination of a provincial governor by his own security guard.The HRCP report noted that the pattern of minor non-Muslim girls disappearing and later resurfacing after allegedly converting to Islam and marrying Muslim men persisted in 2024/25.Hindus in Sindh, who form 8.8% of the population, and Christians in Punjab (1.9%), have raised repeated concerns. A fact-finding study found that forced conversions and coerced marriages remain most prevalent among Scheduled Caste Hindus due to poverty and limited social mobility.The report highlighted the role of cleric-politician Mian Abdul Haq, or Mian Mithu, accused of using his influence to facilitate conversions at his seminary in Ghotki. He was sanctioned by the UK in 2022.The report also cited cases where police were seen siding with abductors, often claiming it would be “haram” to return a girl after conversion.In July 2024, Faisalabad police recovered Christian minor Laiba Suhail, abducted in February and forcibly converted before being married off illegally. Another girl, Alina, is still missing. In January 2025, a Mirpurkhas court heard a plea from a couple accused of forcing an underage Hindu girl to convert and marry.Other cases were reported across provinces: in April 2025, 14-year-old a Hindu girl, Chahat disappeared in Quetta and later claimed in a video to have converted, though her parents produced documents proving she was underage.In May, Hindu Panchayats in Ghotki and Rohri protested the disappearance of a Meghwar teenager in Rohri, fearing abduction for forced conversion. In June, civil society groups and Hindu Panchayats in Larkana expressed concern over three minor girls and a teenage boy from Shahdadpur allegedly being forced to convert.The HRCP stressed that such cases continue to deepen insecurity among religious minorities and called for protective measures to safeguard vulnerable children and their families.The report listed multiple killings of Ahmadis: dentist Zakaur Rahman in Lalamusa (July 2024), Tayyab Ahmad in Rawalpindi (December 2024), Amir Hasan in Naukot (December 2024), Laeeq Cheema lynched in Karachi (April 2025), Muhammad Asif in Kasur (April 2025), and senior doctor Mahmood Sheikh in Sargodha (May 2025).The UN warned, “We are alarmed by ongoing reports of violence and discrimination against the Ahmadiyya community in Pakistan.”“According to the data provided by the Ahmadiyya community, 29 Ahmadi places of worship were attacked and damaged during the review period,” the report said.It further added that in 26 cases, the demolition was carried out by law enforcement agencies.“These incidents occurred in Okara, Khanewal, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Vehari, Sheikhupura, Gujrat, and Sargodha, among other locations Back in January, a historic Sialkot site linked to Pakistan’s first foreign minister Zafarullah Khan was “reduced to rubble”.The report said that the blasphemy law has been often misused to settle personal scores or seek financial gain in Pakistan, where, a ‘mere accusation of blasphemy can be a death sentence.’In September, last year, two men accused of blasphemy were killed while in police custody less than a week apart. One was inexplicably shot and killed in Mirpurkhas during an alleged police encounter, and the other was killed by a police constable inside a police station in Quetta.On 12 September 2024, constable Saad Khan Sarhadi shot dead Abdul Ali, a blasphemy suspect, inside Quetta’s Cantonment Police Station after mobs from religious parties gathered outside demanding his custody. It marked the first such incident in the city where a serving officer killed a suspect in custody. Days later, Ali’s family pardoned Sarhadi, while lawyers and a JUI-F senator pledged legal support for him.Later, on 17 September 2024, Shahnawaz Kunbhar, a civil hospital employee from Umerkot, fled to Karachi after a cleric accused him of posting blasphemous content. He denied the charge in a video message before being arrested by police, who assured his family of protection. Two days later, police claimed he was killed in an encounter, with officers celebrated as heroes.His family was prevented from burying him by armed mobs, and the body was desecrated. Following outrage from rights groups, a Sindh police inquiry declared the encounter “fake.”The report also showed that the mainstream media largely ignored issues of religious freedom under the period covered. Even the Islamabad High Court’s hearings into the “blasphemy business group,” affecting nearly 400 households and livestreamed for four months, drew little coverage. Likewise, cases of coerced marriages, forced conversions and violence against minorities rarely made headlines.A worrying trend has emerged in Pakistan, where ultra-right-wing groups are exerting growing pressure on the judiciary and elected officials through propaganda and intimidation, it added.","The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has raised alarm over violence against minority communities in the country.

’14 Pakistani Soldiers Killed’: Baloch Rebels Attack Day After India’s Strike On Terror Hubs | Watch





The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for an attack in Panjgur that left four Pakistan 's army personnel dead. According to BLA spokesperson Jeeyand Baloch, fighters launched a raid in the Surdu area of Panjgur on Tuesday night, eliminating a key operative of the Pakistan army.The statement revealed that Ghulam Sarwar had earlier established and commanded a so-called death squad under the protection of the Pakistani military. This squad, which had been active for years in Gichek and other parts of Panjgur, was later led by his son, Islam Sarwar. The group allegedly supported the army's operations, carrying out targeted killings, enforced disappearances, and other violent acts. In return, the army reportedly allowed them to freely engage in drug trafficking, kidnappings for ransom and extortion through road checkpoints.During the operation, BLA fighters seized three Kalashnikov rifles, an M-4, additional weapons, two vehicles, and three motorcycles from Islam Sarwar's hideout. The site, according to the BLA, also served as a torture chamber, where electric shock devices and other tools of abuse were found. Islam Sarwar was accused of abducting and killing a young man in Panjgur just two months earlier. Jeeyand Baloch warned that the Pakistani army and its allies would be held accountable for crimes against the Baloch people.The BLA's latest offensive is part of the ongoing insurgency in Balochistan , where separatist groups are demanding greater autonomy and recognition of Baloch rights. In recent years, attacks on military and paramilitary forces, along with government facilities, have intensified.Separatist factions argue that the Baloch people face systemic marginalisation and exploitation, despite the province's wealth in natural resources. In response, Pakistan's military has pursued counterinsurgency campaigns to suppress the rebellion. However, human rights groups have repeatedly raised concerns over reports of forced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and excessive force during these operations.Numerous accounts point to the widespread issue of disappearances, with civilians and activists allegedly detained without due legal process. Rights organisations argue that such tactics fuel fear and deepen mistrust, further straining relations between the Pakistani state and the Baloch population.","Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for an attack in Panjgur that left four Pakistan's army personnel dead.

Rescuers in Pakistan are struggling to recover bodies after flash floods triggered by relentless monsoon rains killed at least 321 people in the past 48 hours, officials told AFP on Saturday. Most casualties were reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where 307 people died as rivers burst their banks and houses collapsed.A video shared by RT.com showed the scale of destruction as torrents swept through towns and villages, leaving entire neighbourhoods in ruins. The floods, described by residents as “doomsday”, have left many communities cut off with relief efforts hampered by washed-out roads and ongoing rainfall.Authorities said around 2,000 rescue workers are engaged in operations across nine districts, but access remains severely restricted.“Heavy rainfall, landslides in several areas, and washed-out roads are causing significant challenges in delivering aid, particularly in transporting heavy machinery and ambulances,” Bilal Ahmed Faizi, spokesman for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s rescue agency, told AFP.“Due to road closures in most areas, rescue workers are travelling on foot to conduct operations in remote regions,” he added.Buner district has been hardest hit, recording at least 184 deaths. Other badly affected areas include Shangla, Mansehra, Swat, Bajaur and Battagram. The provincial government has declared these mountainous districts as disaster zones.Survivors have described terrifying scenes as torrents tore through homes without warning.“I heard a loud noise as if the mountain was sliding. I rushed outside and saw the entire area shaking, like it was the end of the world,” Azizullah told AFP. “The ground was trembling due to the force of the water, and it felt like death was staring me in the face.”Mass funerals were held across affected districts on Friday, with mourners grieving in front of rows of bodies covered by blankets. Local schoolteacher Saifullah Khan said: “We still have no clear idea who in this small village is alive and who is dead. I help retrieve the bodies of the children I taught, I keep wondering what kind of trial nature has imposed on these kids.”Officials warned the death toll is likely to rise further as dozens remain missing. Pakistan’s meteorological department has issued more rain alerts, warning that the intensity of the monsoon will worsen over the next two weeks.","Floods triggered by relentless monsoon rains have killed at least 321 people in Pakistan.

Flash floods caused by heavy rains have killed over 320 people in Pakistan, with dozens still missing. The worst hit was Buner district in the northwest, where 157 people died on Friday after homes and villages were swept away.Authorities declared a state of emergency in Buner as rescuers, using boats and helicopters, struggled to reach stranded families. Ambulances carried more than 100 bodies to hospitals.In neighbouring Mansehra district, emergency teams worked through Thursday night to rescue around 2,000 tourists trapped by flash floods and landslides in the Siran Valley.A helicopter carrying relief supplies crashed in Bajaur due to bad weather, killing all five on board, including two pilots.Pakistan's prime minister Shehbaz Sharif has directed the disaster-management authority to evacuate affected families and tourists.Pakistan’s disaster agency has now issued fresh warnings about glacial lake outburst floods in the north and advised travellers to stay away from risky areas.Since June 26, rain-related disasters have killed at least 556 people across the country, according to the national disaster management authority.Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan region has also seen repeated floods since July, with landslides blocking the Karakoram highway.Experts say such cloudbursts and floods are becoming more common due to climate change. A new study found rainfall in Pakistan this monsoon was 10–15% heavier because of global warming, according to news agency Associated Press.In 2022, Pakistan faced its worst monsoon disaster, which killed more than 1,700 people and caused damage worth billions of dollars.","Since June 26, rain-related disasters have killed at least 556 people across the country.
