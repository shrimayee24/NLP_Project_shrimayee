NEW DELHI: Karnataka Congress MLC Yathindra Siddaramaiah signaled stable leadership ahead of upcoming civic polls, firmly dismissing speculation of a chief minister change and affirming that the party high command has ruled out any shift.Speaking amid preparations for local body elections in Bidar, he emphasised unity by noting multiple capable leaders within Congress while deferring final authority to Delhi.Responding to post-budget rumours of replacing CM Siddaramaiah, Yathindra said, ""They have been saying this, but the high command has clearly sent a message that there won't be any change in the leadership.""He further dismissed such claims, stating, ""I don't think there will be reason to speculate that there will be a change in the leadership.""Elaborating on his stance, he noted that while there are many capable leaders within the party, it does not automatically imply an impending change in leadership.He said, ""There are many leaders in Congress who deserve to, who can become chief minister. But the high command has to decide now. They have not told anything that there will be change in the leadership. So for now, I think the currents they will continue for five years.""Yathindra on Friday reiterated that the party high command had, through an internal communication, made it very clear that there would be no change in leadership. Speaking to reporters in Mysuru, he said, ""According to me, the high command might not have said it openly, but have given a clear signal that there will not be any leadership change. So I believe that Siddaramaiah will be the CM for five years.""Reacting to his remarks, Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar , seen as a key contender for the chief minister’s post, responded with sarcasm, ""Yathindra is our high command, and let's accept what he says very respectfully,"" while adding that such speculation can only be addressed by the party high command in Delhi.The internal power tussle in the party came into focus after the Congress government in Karnataka completed half of its tenure, rekindling talk of an alleged power-sharing formula between Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and his deputy, DK Shivakumar.","Karnataka Congress MLC Yathindra Siddaramaiah dismissed speculation of a chief minister change and affirming that the party high command has ruled out any shift.

Following his arrest by Patna Police in connection with a 1995 case, Purnea MP Pappu Yadav said he was unsure about what lay ahead or where he was being taken. The arrest came after high drama at his Patna residence, where police arrived to take him into custody.Speaking to reporters, Yadav said he was unwell and expressed fears over his safety. “I am not well... I don't know what will happen with me,” he said.Ahead of the arrest, Yadav told ANI that he feared the police might harm him and insisted that he wanted to be taken directly to court instead of a police station. He said the court had summoned him the next day and suggested that house arrest could have been considered. He also questioned the police for arriving in civil clothes, saying he initially thought they had come to kill him. Referring to the case, he noted that it was registered nearly 35 years ago and questioned the need for his arrest at this stage.“I have doubt that these people might have killed me. I will go straight to the Court. I will not go to the police station. If they want, they can house arrest me. The Court has called me. Police reached here in civil uniform like criminals. I thought they had come to kill me. Is this a criminal's house? There was a case registered around 35 years ago, and the police came to arrest me in connection with that case,” Pappu Yadav said.Later, the Independent MP was admitted to IGIMS hospital following health concerns.Patna SP City Bhanu Pratap Singh said the case was registered under the old Indian Penal Code, which has since been replaced by the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS). He said the case involves Sections 419, 420, 468, 448, 506 and 120B and is linked to the Gardanibagh police station.“This is a 1995 case which was under the old IPC, now replaced by the BNS (Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita), involving sections 419, 420, 468, 448, 506, and 120B. The arrest is being made under these sections. This case concerns the Gardanibagh police station. The trial was ongoing in court, and the MP was supposed to appear, but he did not appear on the scheduled date.

'Can't be compelled': SC allows termination of minor's 30-wk fetus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/minor-has-right-over-reproductive-choice-supreme-court/articleshow/128008025.cms,"Minor has right over reproductive choice: Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: It was difficult for Supreme Court to decide - protect the interests of a 30-week pregnant minor girl who did not want an illegitimate child and seek termination of pregnancy or save the unborn child who, as a 30-week fetus, has a beating heart. But the scale of justice tilted in favour of the girl and SC allowed termination of pregnancy, saying she can't be compelled to give birth to a child.Finding itself in the tricky situation as it was asked to prioritise the competing interests, a bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Ujjal Bhuyan admitted it was not easy for it to decide the case. The court finally allowed the plea of the pregnant girl's mother.NEW DELHI: A minor's mother sought Supreme Court's permission for termination of her daughter's pregnancy, taking into consideration that the child would be illegitimate and the girl had to live her life with mental trauma and social stigma. The court said the girl has a right over her reproductive autonomy.The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971 allows abortion up to 20 weeks based on the opinion of one registered medical practitioner, and up to 24 weeks for specific categories of women (including rape survivors and minors) with the opinion of two doctors.Contending that she did not want to give birth to the child, the petitioner sought abortion on the grounds that continuing with pregnancy and giving birth would cause her trauma.Maharashtra govt however, told the court that the fetus at 30 weeks had a beating heart and termination at this stage would result in premature birth of a child who would face the risk of abnormality. The lawyer for the state, Devanshi Singh, contended that the baby could be handed over to an orphanage.The bench asked the state whose interests it was trying to protect. The lawyer responded that it was for the court to take a call. She also brought to the notice of the bench an earlier order passed by SC in 2017, when termination of more than 30 weeks pregnancy was allowed as the girl was only 13 and a rape survivor.Considering the totality of the situation, the court passed the order in favour of the girl but said that termination of pregnancy should not result in feticide. ""It is an illegitimate child. We don't want to comment on the relationship. They cannot get married and she has to carry the stigma for the rest of her life. We have to consider her mental aspect. Can the court ask her to continue with the pregnancy and deliver the child? If we do, then people would not come to court to seek permission and they would go to quack and illegal centres for abortion and life and health would be put at risk,"" the bench said.""Whose interest would prevail is the question. It is very difficult to decide,"" the SC bench said.With any delay likely to complicate the situation further, the bench directed termination of pregnancy. ""We direct the JJ Group of Hospitals, Mumbai, to conduct the procedure of medical termination of pregnancy of the daughter of the appellant herein by bearing in mind all medical safeguards,"" the bench said.The mother had moved SC, through lawyer Shantanu Adkar, after her plea was rejected by Bombay HC, which had held that a forced termination would amount to feticide as the ""fetus is healthy and viable"". It had directed that the teen be provided comprehensive medical and psychological support until her delivery and the child be given away to a registered orphanage.According to the petition, the pregnancy was the result of the girl's relationship with a friend. The mother alleged that the friend had forced the girl into a physical relationship after promising to marry her and FIR had been filed against him.",The court said the girl has a right over her reproductive autonomy. Maharashtra govt told the court that the fetus at 30 weeks had a beating heart. The court passed the order in favour of the girl but said that termination of pregnancy should not result in feticide.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128008111,imgsize-182462,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

‘Nitish Still X-Factor’ Pavan Verma Decodes Why Jan Suraaj Couldn’t Break Through in Bihar Polls

NEW DELHI: Prashant Kishor-headed Jan Suraaj Party on Friday was criticised by the Supreme Court for filing a writ petition seeking annulment of recently concluded Bihar assembly elections on the ground that the poll-eve Rs 10,000 dole to women was a corrupt practice that altered the level-playing field.""How many votes did your party get? People rejected you in the elections. Now you want to use the judicial platform to garner popularity,"" said a bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi. JSP contested 238 seats and failed to win a single seat mustering a poor 3.4% of the votes. The party got less votes than NOTA in 68 constituencies.JSP's counsel C U Singh said that the distribution of Rs 10,000 under the Mukhyamantri Mahila Rojgar Yojna, amounting to a total of Rs 15,600 crore, during the period when the model code of conduct for election was in force amounted to corrupt practice. Terming the doles as freebies, Singh said Bihar is one of the top five fiscal deficit states, and spending such a huge amount from exchequer without economic planning would further impact its financial health.The SC bench said, ""There is a difference between legal and constitutional questions and fiscal policy. If a governing political party is causing harm to the state through its economic policy, then it is for the people to vote it out.We cannot entertain such petitions. It is an omnibus election petition seeking to annul the entire election.""""You file an election petition for each constituency and prove that because of the corrupt practice the candidate has won. Otherwise, if a candidate has won by a margin of 10,000 votes and there were only 1,000 women who got the dole, why should his election be set aside,"" the bench asked.When the counsel continued to persuade the court to examine the legality and constitutionality of election-eve freebies, the bench said it would seriously examine the issue in the pending petitions but not at the instance of a political party which lost the election badly. ""All political parties indulge in the same freebies game once they come to power,"" the bench said.""Why did you not challenge it when the announcement was made about giving Rs 10,000 to each woman in Bihar by the govt,"" the SC bench said.It told the party to move Patna high court. ""You withdraw the petition and file a petition in the HC. We will have the benefit of HC's view,"" the bench said. JSR withdrew its petition.","JSP's counsel C U Singh said that the distribution of Rs 10,000 under the Mukhyamantri Mahila Rojgar Yojna amounted to corrupt practice.

One hospital will come up in Uri and the other in Poonch. Both had borne the brunt of Pakistani shelling during Operation Sindoor.“...In J&K, just as our economy was consolidating with renewed vigour, the barbaric terrorist attack at Pahalgam and its aftermath shocked us.

‘Cannot force her to continue pregnancy’: SC allows abortion of 30-week pregnant minor — why this ruling matters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cannot-force-her-to-continue-pregnancy-sc-allows-abortion-of-30-week-pregnant-minor-why-this-ruling-matters/articleshow/127984216.cms,".

Why the ruling matters

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday allowed the medical termination of a 30-week pregnancy of a 17-year-old girl, observing that courts could not force a woman, especially a minor, to continue a pregnancy if she does not want to.A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Ujjal Bhuyan said the key issue was the minor’s right to decide whether she wanted to continue the pregnancy. They observed that the girl was a minor facing an unfortunate situation and did not wish to give birth.The court also considered the hospital medical board’s report, which stated there was no threat to the life of the mother or the child if the pregnancy continued. However, the judges said the girl’s reproductive autonomy must be respected.During the hearing, Justice Nagarathna said such cases involve difficult moral and legal questions. She pointed out that if courts do not allow safe medical termination in such situations, people may turn to unauthorised and unsafe medical providers, which can be dangerous.Medical termination of pregnancy (MTP) is legal in India under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Act, 2021.The law allows abortion up to 20 weeks with the opinion of one doctor. For certain categories, including minors, rape survivors, and women with disabilities, abortion is allowed between 20 and 24 weeks with the opinion of two doctors. The law also applies to unmarried women.By allowing the termination, the Supreme Court also showed that each case must be considered on its own facts, especially when a minor is involved and has clearly expressed unwillingness to continue the pregnancy. The decision underlines that courts can step in to protect the rights, safety, and dignity of women when required.","Justices B V Nagarathna and Ujjal Bhuyan said the key issue was the minor’s right to decide whether she wanted to continue the pregnancy.

NEW DELHI: Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Friday alleged that Tirupati laddus were prepared using ghee adulterated with ""bathroom-cleaning chemicals"" during the previous Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy–led YSRCP government.Addressing a village meeting in Kalugotla village of Kurnool district, Naidu claimed, ""Ghee made out of bathroom-cleaning chemicals was used in laddus by them (the previous YSRCP government).""He alleged that the earlier regime had undermined the sanctity and prestige of Lord Venkateswara Swamy by allowing adulterated prasadam (consecrated food) to be used at the Tirumala temple.Naidu further claimed that such adulterated ghee was supplied not only for Tirupati laddus but also to the famous Srisailam temple during the YSRCP rule.Ghee mixed with chemicals was allegedly used in the preparation of laddus for nearly five years under the previous government, the chief minister added.Naidu said there are two types of chemicals used in ghee, noting that some are of vegetable origin and costlier, while animal fat is cheaper.Reiterating his charge, Naidu said the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) report stated that animal fat was used.Responding to claims by YSRCP leaders that a CBI-led special investigation team (SIT) had given a clean chit in the case, Naidu alleged that Reddy's uncle and former TTD chairman YV Subba Reddy himself had earlier admitted that adulteration had taken place.Naidu said his government was trying to correct the alleged wrongdoing and claimed there was a ""lot of difference"" between the laddus being prepared now and those made during the previous regime.He alleged that Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) had been desecrated due to the use of adulterated prasadam.Responding to these allegations, YSRCP chief and former chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy said the CBI had given a clean chit to Subba Reddy and B Karunakar Reddy in the case.Speaking to reporters, Reddy reiterated that the CBI SIT had categorically stated that there was no adulteration of animal fat in the ghee""As claimed by (chief minister) Chandrababu Naidu there was no trace of beef tallow, lad or animal fat in the ghee supplied to TTD. Chandrababu Naidu undertook a malicious campaign to insult the sentiments of (Tirupati) Venkateswara Swamy devotees,"" he said.""Not only that, the CBI also gave a clean chit to former TTD chairmen Subba Reddy and Bhumana Karunakar Reddy stating that they did not indulge in any wrongdoing,"" Jagan added.However, Naidu rejected claims of a clean chit, stating that the CBI report does not certify anywhere that there was no adulteration.

NEW DELHI: Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Friday criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Union government over what he called a denial of facts surrounding the publication of former Army chief General M.M. Naravane’s memoir, saying the issue was “right under your nose” and accusing the government of evading key questions raised by the Opposition.Kharge’s remarks came after Opposition parties walked out of the Rajya Sabha during the Prime Minister’s reply to the debate on the President's address yesterday, alleging that their concerns – particularly on national security and China – were not addressed.""There is no need to react to the PM's speech, but I would like to respond to the things he said. Because repeating the lies has been one of his habits,” Kharge said, referring to the Prime Minister’s speech. “In 97 minutes of this speech, the PM did not say anything conclusive, he didn’t reply to any of the concerns we had raised during the discussion, but only spoke about the last 100 years, 75 years and 50 years.”Referring to the controversy over former Army Chief General Naravane’s memoir, Kharge questioned the government’s claim in Parliament that the book had not been published.“When we talk about the country’s defences, we received the published book by General MM Naravane (Retd), but how did you not get it? And you say in the parliament that the book hasn't been published. How can the Defence Minister say that the book is not published? It is a privilege. It is right under your nose,” Kharge said.He alleged that both home minister Amit Shah and defence minister Rajnath Singh repeated the same position in the House before Rahul Gandhi brought an alleged ""memoir"" of ex-Army Chief Naravane in Parliament. “In the end it turned out to be true,” he said.Kharge also questioned the government’s response when Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi raised the issue of China during the debate.“Why were they troubled when LoP Rahul Gandhi raised the issue (China issue)? Listen to the truth and reply… deny it,” he said.Kharge said the Opposition decided to walk out as it felt the Prime Minister had failed to substantively respond to the debate. “It is so unfortunate that he had no substance and answer to the issues we had raised in the House. Later, they only kept abusing me,” he said.Rejecting allegations that the Congress had insulted the Sikh community, after Rahul Gandhi’s comment calling Union minister Raveneet Bittu “traitor” snowbowled into a big controversy, drawing sharp reaction from BJP.Kharge said, “We respect the Sikh community.” He cited former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, saying, “Dr Manmohan Singh, a renowned economist was appointed the Finance Minister and PM twice, the same post as Modi ji.”Accusing the ruling party of relying on attacks rather than governance, Kharge said, “In the last 10 years, what have they done except abuse the Congress?”",Mallikarjun Kharge criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Union government over what he called a denial of facts.

NEW DELHI: Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju on Friday defended the Centre’s decision to keep the Henderson Brooks-Bhagat report on the 1962 India-China war classified, as a political row erupted in Parliament over Leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi being stopped from quoting the “unpublished memoir” of former Army Chief General MM Naravane.In a post on X, Rijiju described the report as a sensitive defence document and said it should not be used for political purposes. He wrote, “Our Govt is led by a matured leader. Since 1962, the Henderson Brooks-Bhagat Commission report has remained secret.

NEW DELHI: BJP MP Nishikant Dubey on Friday said he has decided to set up a library documenting what he described as the “misdeeds, corruption and policy failures” of the Nehru-Gandhi family, and appealed to supporters to contribute books, documents and research material for the initiative.In a post on X, Dubey said the proposed library would serve as a consolidated resource for students, researchers and future generations seeking information on the Congress party ’s first family.“I have decided to create a library on the misdeeds of the Nehru-Gandhi family, the corruption perpetrated by them, the damage inflicted on the country due to their policies, and the harm caused to the nation by their personal activities,” Dubey wrote. “I need cooperation and suggestions from all of you. This library will serve as an ideal resource for future generations and students engaged in research.”In a video message attached to the post, Dubey said his decision followed what he described as a strong public response to remarks he made in Parliament a day earlier, where he had displayed and mentioned a few books.“Yesterday in parliament I said a few things about the Gandhi family's misdeeds, corruption among other things.And there’s been a massive response to it from across the country,” he said.Dubey said people associated with the BJP, the Sangh Parivar and others he described as “nationalist” had reached out to him with historical material. He said the proposed library would compile information related to what he alleged were economic and social policy failures, the Partition of India, and links to figures such as Warren Anderson and Ottavio Quattrocchi.He also referred to documents and reports he said were not fully in the public domain, including material related to the Henderson Brooks report on the 1962 China war and the Shah Commission report.“Bringing it all together I’ll make a library… a one point centre that if you need any information regarding them for research or for the coming generation you find it there in the library,” he said, appealing for cooperation and inputs.Dubey’s remarks come amid heightened political sparring in Parliament, where proceedings have seen disruptions following a row involving Congress MP and Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi.The controversy began after Gandhi attempted to refer to excerpts from an unpublished memoir of former Army chief General MM Naravane during a debate on Motion of Thanks to the President's address to parliament, drawing objections from treasury benches, including defense minister Rajnath Singh, and home minister Amit Shah over the use of material not yet in the public domain.The issue has since escalated into broader exchanges between the ruling BJP and the Congress, with both sides accusing each other of politicising sensitive historical and institutional issues. After Rahul was not able to speak in the Lower House, opposition has been continuously protesting in and outside the house, leading to suspension of eighth Congress MPs.Later on Thursday the motion was passed without a customary reply by the PM. It came as PM Modi who was scheduled to address the Lok Sabha at 5.00 pm on Wednesday couldn’t speak amid the constant pandemonium in the house, after Speaker Om Birla insisted PM not to come to parliament fearing some untoward incident.","BJP MP Nishikant Dubey says he has decided to set up a library documenting what he described as the “misdeeds, corruption and policy failures” of the Nehru- Gandhi family.

'Justice Is Crying...': Mamata Banerjee Takes EC Head On In Supreme Court Over SIR Row In Bengal

Observing that a govt must behave as a ‘model employer’ and lack of funds cannot be a ground to deny its employees their dues, Supreme Court Thursday directed West Bengal govt to pay dearness allowance (DA) to its employees for the 2008-19 period.A bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and Prashant Kumar Mishra ordered that the first instalment should be paid by March 31 and appointed a committee, comprising its former judge Indu Malhotra, former chief justice of Jharkhand HC Tarlok Singh Chauhan, former HC judge Goutam Bhaduri and Comptroller and Auditor General of India, to monitor implementation of its order.SC rejected Bengal govt’s defence it lacked funds and said it is not open for the State to shirk its responsibility of paying DA on account of financial difficulty, given that it is an obligation arising out of a statute of its own creation.“It has often been recognised that the State must set an example for other employers in the country by behaving as a ‘model employer’. Such a position should not be difficult to attain given all the advantages that it has. Its power lies in the volume of employment, its sovereign/constitutional authority to tax, ability to borrow and manage public finances... Leading by example, fulfilling its financial duties in times of fiscal strain, gives it the moral authority to wield the sword of law against private entities, should they not do so.SC said the least that is expected of a State in a democracy is that it honours its obligations and commitments arising from a legislation or judicial decisions, for such obligations are not discretionary.“This clear position protects such statutory obligations, for if such a ground of limited financial ability was readily available to govt, which may undoubtedly in certain situations face tough times, it would render these obligations illusory. When it comes to employees’ dues, this proposition would be extremely dangerous and stifling since the amounts received thereby are not handouts or acts of charity but are earned compensation/consideration for services given,” it said.",West Bengal govt ordered to pay dearness allowance (DA) to its employees for the 2008-19 period.

While some other senior NCP functionaries showed reluctance for a merger with NCP (SP), the Pawar family said Sunetra would speak about it on behalf of her party.Interacting with reporters in Baramati, NCP (SP) state general secretary and Ajit Pawar’s nephew Rohit Pawar said: “As the Pawar family, we also wish that after taking charge as deputy CM, Sunetra Kaki (aunt) should be the next NCP chief.” On the issue of merger, he said there had been no discussion so far in the family. “We will take it up after the mourning period as it is important to know the members’ opinions. Since Sunetra Kaki (aunt) has taken charge as deputy CM and all NCP MLAs support her, she will speak on the merger after Feb 9.

Trial courts across the country continued to impose death penalty in significant numbers in 2025 even as appellate courts set aside or modified most of these sentences, raising “serious concerns about the reliability of convictions in capital cases”, finds an annual study by The Square Circle Clinic — a criminal justice initiative of NALSAR University of Law, Hyderabad.From 2016 to 2025, trial courts imposed 1,310 death sentences but high courts confirmed only 106, according to ‘Death Penalty in India: Annual Statistics Report 2025’ released on Feb 4. Of the death sentences confirmed by HCs, Supreme Court decided a little over a half of them and upheld none, shows the report.The data points to a persistent gap between trial court sentencing and appellate outcomes. As of Dec 31 last year, 574 prisoners were on death row which the report described as “the largest number of persons on death row at the end of a calendar year since 2016”.In this backdrop, sessions courts sentenced 128 people to death across 94 cases in 2025, finds the study.In 2025 alone, HCs acquitted, commuted, remanded or recorded abatement in most of the death sentence cases they decided, and SC’s record reflects a similar pattern, shows the report. The study finds that the apex court has not confirmed a single death sentence in 2023-2025, even where HCs had initially upheld them.In 2025 alone, high courts acquitted 35 individuals across 22 cases. SC acquitted accused in more than half the cases it decided, recording the highest number of death row acquittals — 10 persons — in the past decade.“The frequency with which death sentences are overturned at the appellate stage raises serious concerns about the reliability of convictions in capital cases,” the report states.Those acquitted by HCs spent an average of 5.17 years on death row, with several remaining under death sentence for close to two decades before being exonerated.“High rates of acquittals from death row expose a deep fracture in the criminal legal system,” said Shreya Rastogi, director, litigation and forensics at The Square Circle Clinic. “When more than a third of HC confirmation cases result in acquittals, it indicates failures in investigation and prosecution that harm victims and accused alike. These errors cost people decades of their lives and freedom.”The failures identified by the report are spread across the criminal justice process, said Maitreyi Misra, director, research and mitigation, The Square Circle Clinic. “Supreme Court itself has repeatedly pointed out failures at multiple levels — investigation agencies, prosecution and lower courts — while acquitting people on death row,” she said.","From 2016 to 2025, trial courts imposed 1,310 death sentences but high courts confirmed only 106.

What the data says

No gangs, priority to children

Political sparring





NEW DELHI: Delhi Police on Friday said claims of a sudden surge in missing girls and children in the capital were being amplified through paid promotions, warning of strict action against those “creating panic for monetary gains”.In two posts on X over the last 24 hours, the police rejected what they called rumour-driven narratives. On Thursday evening, Delhi Police appealed to citizens “not to fall victim to rumours of a sudden rise in cases of missing children”, cautioning that those misrepresenting statistics to spread fear would face legal action.On Friday morning, the force went a step further, saying that after following multiple leads, it had found the “hype” around missing girls being pushed through paid promotion.The police assertion is backed by official data released the same day, which shows that missing-person cases in Delhi have remained largely stable over the past decade, with a marginal decline in recent months.According to Delhi Police, the city recorded a 2% drop in missing-person cases in 2025, a downward trend that has continued into early 2026. In January 2026, 1,777 cases were reported — lower than the 2025 monthly average of 2,042 and slightly below the 1,786 cases recorded in January 2024.Police said Delhi maintains a per-capita missing-person rate of 122.5 per 1,00,000 population, which it claims is lower than comparable figures in the UK and the US. Since 2016, 1,80,805 missing persons have been traced, reflecting a cumulative recovery rate of about 77%.Senior officers stressed that high reporting numbers should not be mistaken for a rise in long-term disappearances. “Delhi follows a digital-first, transparent reporting system. Even short-duration absences — a child delayed from school, a teenager temporarily unreachable due to connectivity issues, or precautionary complaints by anxious parents — are immediately recorded,” an officer said. Many such cases, police added, are resolved within hours but remain on record if families do not formally report the person’s return.The pace of recovery has also accelerated. In 2016, 23,409 people were reported missing, of whom 20,029 were eventually traced — an 85% recovery achieved over nine years. In contrast, 2025 saw 24,508 missing-person reports, with 15,421 traced within the same calendar year itself, indicating a 63% recovery rate in a much shorter time frame. Police said these figures will continue to improve as ongoing investigations conclude.Delhi Police PRO Sanjay Tyagi said there was “no need for fear or panic”, particularly regarding children. “Compared to the past, there has been no increase in missing-person reports in Delhi. In January 2026, there was a drop compared to the same period last year,” Tyagi said in a video message.He emphasised that missing children cases are prioritised under standard operating procedures, with dedicated district-level missing-person squads and the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit (AHTU) of the Crime Branch working round the clock. Missing persons can be reported at police stations, online, or through ERSS-112.Importantly, Tyagi said no organised gangs have been found involved in missing children or kidnapping cases in the capital. “We appeal to people not to pay heed to rumours. Appropriate action will be taken against those spreading them,” he said.Officers working on the ground said many recovered children had left home willingly. Senior Constable Monika of the AHTU explained that younger children often go missing because they do not know their address or parents’ contact details, while teenagers are sometimes lured by strangers or influenced by social media. “With technical surveillance and CCTV analysis, we trace such children,” she said.Head Constable Seema Tyagi added that academic pressure, family disputes and personal issues are common triggers among teenagers. “Many provide false details after leaving home. Sometimes families hesitate to report immediately due to fear of social stigma,” she said.The police clarification comes amid a political row after former Delhi chief minister and AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal raised concerns over safety, citing reports of 807 missing persons in the first 15 days of 2026.“In Delhi, 807 people have gone missing in just 15 days, most of them women and children. These circumstances are extremely frightening,” Kejriwal posted on X, questioning law and order under BJP rule.Delhi Police, however, maintained that such figures, when seen without context, can be misleading. “Transparent and accessible reporting often leads to higher immediate numbers, but that reflects responsiveness — not a breakdown of safety,” a senior officer said, reiterating that panic-driven narratives, especially those pushed through paid campaigns, would not be tolerated.","Delhi Police rubbishes'missing' girls theory after Arvind Kejriwal raises concern.

KOLHAPUR: Sunil Motilal Sadarangani (59), former owner of Solapur’s well-known Multani Bakery, allegedly died by suicide on Thursday afternoon by jumping from the 17th floor of an apartment building in the Vijapur Road area of the city.Police said no suicide note was found and the family informed them that he had been facing financial problems.Police said Sadarangani had shifted to Pune after selling the bakery some years ago.At around 2.30 pm on Thursday, he drove to the apartment building in Solapur, parked his car and took the stairs to reach the top floor to avoid biometric check-in.He was initially seen walking along the side portion of the terrace. After a security guard noticed him, the guard took him down to the 10th floor and tried to convince him.However, Sadarangani asked the guard to go away and went back up, saying he had left his car keys behind. By the time the security guard reached the terrace again, Sadarangani had jumped, police said. He died on the spot.Police confirmed his identity using the car’s registration number.Solapur commissioner of Police M Rajkumar said, “He had shifted to Pune.The family told us that he was undergoing psychological issues and was in debt, which led him to take this step. We are yet to record statements from the family members as they are grieving. There is no foul play detected so far in the case, and no suicide note was found.”A close relative told TOI, “Sadarangani belonged to the Sindhi community. His father, Motilal, started the bakery, which later became famous. The family also ran a flour mill. Sunil Sadarangani took over the business after his father passed away, but sold it due to debt. He is survived by two sons—one settled abroad and the other in Pune, where he had shifted four years ago.”The last rites of Sadarangani were performed on Friday evening in Solapur. As he was the third generation of his family to grow up in the city, a large number of people gathered at the crematorium.","Sunil Motilal Sadarangani (59), former owner of Solapur’s well-known Multani Bakery, allegedly died by suicide on Thursday afternoon by jumping from the 17th floor of an apartment building.

The US Pentagon has announced it will end all military training, fellowship and certificate programmes with Harvard University, escalating the Trump administration’s long-running confrontation with the Ivy League institution over higher-education reforms.US defense secretary Pete Hegseth said on Friday that the decision would take effect from the 2026-27 academic year and would halt graduate-level professional military education offered at Harvard. Personnel currently enrolled will be allowed to complete their courses. Similar programmes at other Ivy League universities will be reviewed in the coming weeks, he added.“Harvard no longer meets the needs of the War Department or the military services,” Hegseth said in a statement. “For too long, this department has sent our best and brightest officers to Harvard, hoping the university would better understand and appreciate our warrior class. Instead, too many of our officers came back looking too much like Harvard – heads full of globalist and radical ideologies that do not improve our fighting ranks. ”In a separate post on X, Hegseth wrote, “Harvard is woke; The War Department is not.”The move comes as part of a broader campaign by President Donald Trump’s administration against Harvard, which has been a central target in its effort to reshape the nation’s most prominent universities.Federal officials have cut billions of dollars in research funding to the university and sought to bar it from enrolling foreign students after Harvard rejected a series of government demands last April.The White House has said the measures are intended to punish Harvard for tolerating anti-Jewish bias on campus. Harvard leaders, however, argue they are facing unlawful retaliation for refusing to adopt the administration’s ideological positions. The university has filed two lawsuits against the government, and a federal judge has issued rulings siding with Harvard in both cases. The administration is appealing those decisions.Tensions appeared to ease over the summer after Trump suggested a deal with Harvard was close, but negotiations stalled. On Monday, the president raised his demands, seeking $1 billion from the university as a condition for restoring federal funding, double the amount previously proposed.Hegseth himself earned a master’s degree from Harvard but publicly returned his diploma during a 2022 Fox News segment. A Pentagon social media account later reposted the clip, showing him writing “Return to Sender” on the diploma.The US military traditionally allows officers to pursue graduate education through its own war colleges and select civilian institutions. While civilian degrees often offer limited immediate benefit to military promotion, they can enhance career prospects after service.",US defense secretary Pete Hegseth said on Friday that the decision would take effect from the 2026-27 academic year.

White House Defends Trump Post As Racism Row Over Obama Video Intensifies | WATCH





US President Donald Trump refused to apologise Friday after posting and then deleting a racist video depicting former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama as apes in a jungle, insisting he had not seen the offensive content and blaming a staffer for the mistake.The video was posted late Thursday night and remained online for nearly 12 hours before it was removed amid bipartisan outrage, including criticism from close Trump allies. The White House initially defended the post and dismissed the backlash as “fake outrage,” but later said a staffer had posted the video in error.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday evening, Trump acknowledged that he had watched a part of the video before it was posted. He said it was taken down “as soon as we found out about it.”“I looked at the beginning of it. It was fine,” Trump said, referring to the opening portion of the video that contained debunked claims about fraud in voting machines.“It was a very strong post in terms of voter fraud,” he continued, as quoted by CNN. “Nobody knew that that was in the end. If they would have looked, they would have seen it, and probably they would have had the sense to take it down.”Trump said he passed the video along to a staffer after watching the beginning and said that person should have reviewed it fully before posting it. “Somebody slipped and missed a very small part,” he said.When asked directly whether he would apologise for the post, Trump declined.“No,” he said. “I didn’t make a mistake.”The White House’s statement came after intense backlash, including from GOP Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only Black Republican in the Senate, who called the video racist and urged Trump to remove it.“Praying it was fake because it’s the most racist thing I’ve seen out of this White House. The President should remove it,” Scott wrote on X.One White House adviser, as quoted by CNN, said, “The president was not aware of that video, and was very let down by the staffer who put it out.” Another ally sought to place blame on a specific aide.Near the end of the short video, the Obamas briefly appear with their faces superimposed onto the bodies of apes as it promotes false claims that voting machines helped steal the 2020 election. For about one second, the song “The Lion Sleeps Tonight” plays in the background.Former vice president Kamala Harris criticised the White House’s explanation, writing on X, “No one believes this cover up from the White House, especially since they originally defended the post. We are all clear-eyed about who Donald Trump is and what he believes.”The office of California governer Gavin Newsom also condemned the video. “Disgusting behavior by the President. Every single Republican must denounce this. Now,” it said in a post on X.","White House initially defended the post and dismissed the backlash as “fake outrage,” but later said a staffer had posted the video in error.

DHAKA: Violent anti-govt protests returned to the streets of Dhaka, but this time against the interim administration headed by Muhammad Yunus.Hundreds of govt employees, demanding implementation of the Ninth National Pay Scale and raising slogans - such as ""there is no rice in the stomach, development is only in words"" and ""injustice will be washed away with blood""- against Yunus, marched through the Bangladesh capital as police used tear gas, water cannons and sound grenades to disperse them.

ISLAMABAD: A suicide blast at a Shia mosque in Islamabad killed at least 31 on Friday, with a police source saying more than 170 were wounded in the deadliest attack in Pakistan's capital since the 2008 Marriott bombing that claimed 60 lives.The explosion at the Imam Bargah Qasr-e-Khadijatul Kubra mosque on the city's outskirts occurred after Friday prayer, police said, adding the toll was ""expected to rise"".""The attacker was stopped at the gate and detonated himself,"" a security source said.No group claimed responsibility.

Mandelson-Epstein Scandal Rocks UK Parliament; Starmer Under Siege Over Russian Spy Claims, Judgment

Leadership challenges add to pressure on Starmer





The global fallout from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal is threatening the political future of a world leader — but not the one many might expect.British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has never been directly linked to Epstein, yet he is facing mounting political pressure connected to the wider fallout of the case. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump — whose name appears in some investigative files related to the disgraced financier — is facing no immediate political threat. As political tensions grow in Britain, Epstein victims continue to push for further accountability in Washington.The contrast highlights the different political environments facing both leaders. While British institutions focused on scrutiny and accountability are actively probing links tied to the scandal, Trump’s influence over the Justice Department and strong backing within the Republican-controlled Congress have limited political fallout for him. At the same time, the reach of the Epstein files continues to expand globally, with implications now touching countries including Norway and Poland, nearly seven years after Epstein’s death.In the United Kingdom, public anger over any association with Epstein has been intense. King Charles III stripped his brother, former Prince Andrew, of royal titles and removed him from royal duties due to his links with Epstein.In contrast, the United States has not seen similar political or institutional consequences for figures connected to Epstein, who died by suicide in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking and abuse charges involving underage girls.One of the most prominent figures to face professional consequences was former US treasury secretary Larry Summers. The former Harvard University president stepped back from public roles last year after emails revealed he had exchanged sexist remarks and sought personal advice from Epstein. Summers later said he was “deeply ashamed.”Trump, meanwhile, is attempting to move past renewed scrutiny after the US Department of Justice said there would be no further prosecutions tied to the case. Authorities have not charged Trump or anyone else named in newly released files, and there is no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by the president. Some references to Trump in the documents are routine, while others include newly surfaced, unverified sexual assault allegations and accounts from some Epstein victims describing encounters with the future president.Starmer’s political crisis, however, has deepened. His leadership came under further strain after unrest among Labour Party lawmakers added to ongoing challenges facing his government.During a tense parliamentary session, Starmer acknowledged he was aware of the relationship between former Cabinet minister Peter Mandelson and Epstein before appointing him ambassador to Washington.Starmer dismissed Mandelson last year after earlier Epstein documents showed Mandelson maintained ties with Epstein after his 2008 sex offense conviction in Florida. The controversy intensified this week following newly released files suggesting Mandelson may have shared sensitive, market-moving information with Epstein during the 2008 financial crisis. Mandelson is now under criminal investigation and has resigned from both the House of Lords and the Labour Party.“Mandelson betrayed our country, our parliament and my party,” Starmer told parliament.The political fallout in Britain is being driven not only by Epstein’s crimes but by deeper, ongoing tensions in British politics. Starmer is facing pressure less than two years after winning a landslide election victory, with speculation growing about potential leadership challenges within the Labour Party.British prime ministers face constant internal party pressure in a system where leadership challenges can emerge quickly. The current crisis comes after more than a decade of political instability that saw the UK cycle through multiple prime ministers.The Epstein scandal has also revived scrutiny of Mandelson’s long and controversial political career. Once a key architect of Labour’s transformation in the 1990s alongside Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, Mandelson helped move the party toward the political center. However, repeated controversies — often linked to his connections with wealthy and influential figures — have overshadowed his legacy.The scandal has also revived debate about the British royal family, particularly Prince Andrew’s association with Epstein and his settlement with Virginia Giuffre, who accused him of abuse after being trafficked by Epstein. Andrew denied wrongdoing and made no admission of liability or guilt, but the settlement intensified public criticism and contributed to his removal from royal duties.While Epstein-related developments have created turbulence in US politics, they have not posed a direct threat to Trump’s presidency. He has not been accused of any crimes related to the case, though his past association with Epstein continues to draw scrutiny.Trump remains politically resilient despite ongoing controversies, from immigration policies to disputes over election integrity. His political strategy often involves overwhelming public discourse with multiple issues simultaneously, reducing the impact of any single controversy.","UK PM Keir Starmer has never been directly linked to Epstein, yet he is facing mounting political pressure. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump — whose name appears in some investigative files related to the disgraced financier — is facing no immediate political threat. The contrast highlights the different political environments facing both leaders.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127929154,imgsize-946021,width-400,resizemode-4/feb-05.jpg"
US accuses China of secret N-tests in 2020,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-accuses-china-of-secret-n-tests-in-2020/articleshow/128009899.cms,"China Rejects Trump De-Nuclearisation Suggestion As Russia-US Treaty Collapses After Decades





GENEVA: The US accused China Friday of conducting a secret nuclear test in 2020 as it called for a new arms control treaty that would bring in China as well as Russia. The accusations at a global disarmament conference highlighted serious tensions between Washington and Beijing at a pivotal moment in nuclear arms control, a day after the treaty limiting US and Russian missile and warhead deployments expired.The 2010 New START treaty which ran out Thursday left Russia and the US for the first time since 1972 without any binding constraints on their deployments of strategic missiles and warheads. President Trump wants to replace it with a new pact including China, which is rapidly increasing its own arsenal. In the meantime, Washington says it will keep modernising its own nuclear forces. ""Russia and China should not expect the US to stand still while they shirk their obligations and expand their nuclear forces. We will maintain a robust, credible, and modernised nuclear deterrent,"" US secretary of state Marco Rubio said.President Trump Thursday rejected an offer from President Putin to voluntarily extend the caps on strategic nuclear weapons deployments. On Friday, Russian and US negotiators discussed the expiration of the strategic arms pact, the Kremlin said. ""There is an understanding, and they talked about it in Abu Dhabi, that both parties will take responsible positions and both parties realise the need to start talks as soon as possible,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.Speaking at the disarmament conference in Geneva, US under secretary of state for arms control and international security, Thomas DiNanno said, ""I can reveal that the US govt is aware that China has conducted nuclear tests, including preparing for tests with designated yields in the hundreds of tons.""China has used 'decoupling', a method to decrease the effectiveness of seismic monitoring, to hide their activities from the world,"" DiNamo said. He said China had conducted one such ""yield-producing test"" on June 22, 2020.China's ambassador on disarmament, Shen Jian said Beijing had always acted responsibly on nuclear issues. ""China notes that the US continues to hype up the so-called China nuclear threat. China firmly opposes such false narratives,"" he said. ""It (the US) is the culprit for aggravating the arms race.""DiNanno said : ""Today, the US faces threats from multiple powers. A treaty with only one nuclear power is inappropriate in 2026.""

What happened in the shooting





A federal judge on Friday cleared the way for Chicago woman Marimar Martinez to publicly release critical evidence from her case, including text messages from the Border Patrol agent who shot her, body camera footage, photos, and FBI reports.US District Judge Georgia Alexakis said the materials reveal not only the agent’s mindset but also how the Department of Homeland Security responded after the October 4 incident.Among the texts are messages from agent Charles Exum boasting about the shooting. In one, he wrote: “I fired 5 rounds and she had 7 holes. Put that in your book, boys.” DHS lawyers had argued the release could harm Exum and his family, but the judge countered that Martinez, wrongly labelled a “domestic terrorist,” deserves her reputation to be cleared.Martinez was shot five times after a collision between her vehicle and federal agents’ cars in Chicago. She denies ramming their vehicles and claims the agents were the aggressors.Exum’s body camera was off, but other agents’ footage and Martinez’s 911 call capture the chaos.

Obama ‘monkey’ video: From birtherism to the Nobel Prize — why Donald Trump is so obsessed with Barack Obama,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/obama-monkey-video-from-birtherism-to-the-nobel-prize-why-donald-trump-is-so-obsessed-with-barack-obama/articleshow/128006360.cms,"Trump's Meme Backfires; US Pres. Deletes Video Of Obamas As Monkeys | White House Blames Staffer

Why Obama? The answer is hardly a mystery.

Nobel prize

Birther theory

How he went dismantling Obama victories?





Nearly a decade after Barack Obama left the White House, Donald Trump continues to invoke his predecessor, keeping Obama at the center of political attacks, online commentary, and viral controversies, a pattern that has resurfaced once again with Trump’s latest social media post.Trump's obsession with Obama is not a hidden fact for anyone. Trump shared an AI-generated video, which was posted on X in October 2025, on his Truth Social account, showing several prominent Democrats as animals bowing before Trump.Last year also, Trump posted on social media an AI-generated video based on footage of that meeting that showed the former president being forcibly detained by the FBI and then pacing inside a jail cell.The AI-generated video appears to project everything Trump fears and envies about his predecessor: Obama’s composure, intellect, global standing — and, above all, the way his presidency reshaped what power and leadership could look like in America. Obama’s presence in the White House challenged long-held assumptions, and that legacy continues to loom large.For years, Obama has occupied an outsized place in Trump’s political psyche.Some observers trace Trump’s decision to run for president to the moment Obama publicly mocked him at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner. On the campaign trail, Trump has repeatedly conflated Obama with President Joe Biden, at times incorrectly claiming he “beat Obama” in the 2016 election. He has even compared their health, insisting he is fitter than his former predecessor.Trump who is obsessed to win the Nobel prize, is actually won by Obama. Donald Trump spent years obsessing about winning it himself. Barack Obama passed a historic health care law, and Trump made it his top priority to overturn it.""He got it for doing nothing. Obama got a prize - he didn't even know what - he got elected, and they gave it to Obama for doing absolutely nothing but destroying our country,"" Trump said.""They gave it to Obama for absolutely nothing but destroying our country,"" Trump told reporters.""I've stopped eight wars, so that's never happened before - but they'll have to do what they do. Whatever they do is fine. I know this: I didn't do it for that, I did it because I saved a lot of lives,"" he added.Trump’s rise in politics was fueled in large part by his fixation on Obama. The birther conspiracy — falsely claiming Obama was foreign, un-American, and illegitimate, helped Trump build a loyal base by turning racial resentment into political capital. That strategy did not merely attack Obama; it questioned his right to hold power.In March 2011, Trump publicly claimed he had “real doubts” about whether Barack Obama possessed a valid US birth certificate. In the days that followed, he said he was dispatching private investigators to Hawaii to uncover the truth and even pledged to donate $5 million to charity if anyone could prove Obama was born in the United States.On April 27, 2011, the Obama White House released Obama’s long-form birth certificate in an effort to put the conspiracy theories to rest. Trump later cited the release as a “great service” he claimed to have performed by forcing the issue into the open.The reality, however, unfolded differently. In the years that followed, Trump continued to question Obama’s birthplace. In 2012, he tweeted that an “extremely credible source” had told him the birth certificate was fraudulent. In 2013, he cast suspicion on the death of a Hawaiian health official who had verified copies of the document. A year later, he urged hackers to obtain Obama’s college records to check his “place of birth. ”As president, Trump systematically dismantled Obama’s legacy—exiting the Iran deal, attempting to repeal Obamacare, and repeatedly blaming Obama for policy failures—while Obama campaigned against him in 2016 and 2020, claiming he could have beaten Trump in a third term. This long-running feud, equal parts policy dispute and personal grievance, has persisted into Trump’s second term, finding fresh expression in posts like the recent video.","Trump shared an AI-generated video, which was posted on X in October 2025, on his Truth Social account.

USMS responds, cites safety concerns





A two-second cellphone video showing a US Marshal kicking a small dog during an arrest operation in Memphis has gone viral, triggering outrage online and prompting an official response from the US Marshals Service (USMS).The incident occurred around 1 p.m. on February 4, 2026, when members of the Memphis Safe Task Force were serving an arrest warrant in the 1200 block of Raines Road. Authorities said they were attempting to apprehend Jaquize Henderson, who was wanted in connection with a commercial burglary case in north Mississippi.The video, shared widely on social media and obtained by WREG, appears to show a deputy marshal kicking a small dog outside an apartment complex. The woman who recorded the clip described the action as “unacceptable,” telling WREG that “power doesn’t excuse abuse.”According to her account, officers were arresting a man on an outstanding warrant when the dog ran out of an apartment and began moving around the area before it was kicked. She added that the dog was later taken to a veterinarian, who confirmed it had suffered a broken rib.In a statement released after the video gained traction online, the USMS said the dog had “tried repeatedly and aggressively to attack the working K9” that was present during the operation.“The dog’s owner was instructed to restrain the dog but did not do so. A deputy U.S. marshal blocked the animal to keep it away from the K9,” the statement read. While acknowledging that “the appearance of the incident is unfortunate,” the agency maintained that the action was a “last-resort, split-second” decision made to control a potentially dangerous situation.Officials also noted that Memphis leash laws require dogs to be restrained at all times, whether on or off the owner’s property.","A two-second cellphone video showing a US Marshal kicking a small dog during an arrest operation in Memphis has gone viral.

Pakistan has been invited to participate in upcoming talks between Iran and the United States aimed at easing tensions between the two countries, slated to take place on Friday in Turkey.“Pakistan has received the invitation for the upcoming talks between Iran and the United States,” Pakistan foreign office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said while responding to a query, reported Dawn.Pakistan's deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar is expected to take part in the meeting, the daily reported citing a diplomatic source, adding that “Islamabad’s participation was seen as significant.”An Arab official told AFP on condition of anonymity that the meeting is likely to be held in Turkiye on Friday. The format of the talks remains unclear, though the official said the main meeting would take place that day.A regional official told Reuters that the priority of the talks was to avoid conflict and de-escalate tensions between Iran and the US, adding that several regional powers had been invited at the foreign ministers’ level.According to the official, countries invited include Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, Oman and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).US outlet Axios, citing two sources and a US official, reported that Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi was expected to meet US envoy Steve Witkoff in Istanbul to discuss a possible agreement related to Iran’s nuclear programme.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian confirmed on Tuesday that he had instructed Araghchi to pursue “fair and equitable negotiations” in an environment “free from threats and unreasonable expectations”.The talks, he said in posts on X, would be held “within the framework of our national interests”.US President Donald Trump has said he is hopeful Washington would “work something out” with Iran but warned on Monday that “bad things would happen” if no deal was reached.In an interview with CNN on Sunday, Araghchi said: “President Trump said no nuclear weapons, and we fully agree. We fully agree with that. That could be a very good deal.”“In return, we expect sanctions to be lifted,” he added, while warning that Iran was prepared for war if talks failed, saying any conflict would likely spread beyond Iran.Turkiye has been leading diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions, with Araghchi visiting Istanbul last week and engaging with regional counterparts, including in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan.Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have assured Tehran that they would not allow their airspace or territory to be used for military action against Iran, while Jordan has said it would not act as a “launching pad” for any such action.","Pakistan has been invited to participate in upcoming talks between Iran and the United States.

A Pakistani anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Tuesday issued non-bailable arrest warrants against Aleema Khan, sister of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan in connection with a protest held in Islamabad in November 2024.According to news agency PTI citing a media report, the warrants were issued by the ATC in Rawalpindi after Aleema Khan failed to appear before the court despite earlier directions.The court also issued non-bailable arrest warrants against her two guarantors and ordered that all three be arrested and produced before it on Wednesday, without fail. Aleema’s application seeking exemption from personal appearance was rejected.The case, registered at Sadiqabad Police Station, relates to a protest at D-Chowk in Islamabad on November 24, 2024 and includes charges of protesting against the government, chanting anti-government slogans, vandalism and stone-pelting. ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah conducted the hearing.The court also issued a show-cause notice to the Superintendent of Police (SP), Rawal, for failing to execute the arrest warrants.The SP has been directed to appear before the court on Wednesday and explain why Aleema Khan was not arrested and presented despite clear orders, according to Pakistani news website Express Tribune.During Monday’s hearing, Aleema Khan’s defence counsel sought a one-day exemption, citing difficulties in travel and daily affairs after her bank accounts, Computerised National Identity Card and passport were reportedly blocked. The court, however, did not accept the plea.The proceedings have drawn attention as Aleema Khan had earlier skipped multiple hearings in the case and appeared only after the court issued property seizure orders and several arrest warrants. She is among those nominated as accused in protest-related cases filed following the November demonstrations.The protest followed Imran Khan’s “final call” for nationwide demonstrations demanding the restoration of the party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) electoral mandate, the release of party leaders and the reversal of constitutional changes.The D-Chowk protest ended on November 26 after a security operation, with several cases registered across Rawalpindi district.

Troops ‘physically handicapped’ by vast terrain

Insurgency background and wider fallout





Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif said the country’s security forces are “physically handicapped” by the sheer size of Balochistan as they battle a fresh surge in militant violence, after authorities reported killing 177 insurgents in sweeping counter-terror operations across the province.Addressing the national assembly, Asif described the scale of the challenge facing troops deployed in Pakistan’s largest and least populated province, where coordinated attacks triggered one of the deadliest security crises in recent years. His remarks came after militants launched simultaneous assaults in multiple towns, targeting civilians, homes and security installations.“Balochistan constitutes over 40 per cent of Pakistan geographically...To control it is much more difficult than a populated city, and it needs deployment of massive forces. Our troops are deployed there and are in action against them (terrorists), but they are physically handicapped by guarding and patrolling such a big area,” Asif told lawmakers, as quoted by PTI.Security officials said the death toll of militants had risen to 177 in the past two days following large-scale raids and gun battles.The operations were launched after insurgents carried out coordinated attacks at 12 locations, with authorities confirming that at least 17 police and security personnel were killed, along with dozens of civilians.Asif said the weekend violence claimed 33 civilian lives and 17 members of the security forces. He ruled out talks with the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), saying no negotiations would be held with “terrorists” responsible for killing civilians, including women and children.Balochistan, which borders Iran and Afghanistan, has long faced a separatist insurgency driven by ethnic Baloch groups who accuse the central government of discrimination and exploitation. Authorities say groups such as the BLA have targeted security forces, infrastructure and projects linked to the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor.Train services between Balochistan and the rest of Pakistan remained suspended for a third day, while mobile and internet services were cut in several districts during clean-up operations. Provincial officials said services were expected to resume once the security situation stabilised.Asif dismissed claims that Balochistan had been neglected, saying the province had seen development, including multiple airports. He also rejected the “missing persons” narrative, alleging that names of militants killed in operations had appeared on such lists. “This narrative has been concocted. I also used to support this cause and protest over it. But, terrorists and criminal elements have hijacked all these narratives,” he said.","Khawaja Asif says security forces are 'physically handicapped' by sheer size of Balochistan.

Combat-related deaths in Pakistan rose 43% month-on-month to 361 in January, data released on Monday by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) showed.The fatalities included 242 militants, 73 civilians, and 46 security personnel, according to the Islamabad-based think tank.At least 135 people were injured, among them 71 were civilians, 52 security personnel, and 12 militants.PICSS reported 87 militant attacks across Pakistan in January, a 28% rise from the 68 incidents recorded in December 2025. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa bore the brunt, with 58 incidents—38 in the mainland districts and 20 in the tribal areas. The restive Balochistan followed with 27 attacks, while Punjab reported two targeted incidents.Balochistan emerged as the main theatre of militant violence and security operations, recording its highest monthly militant death toll since the current insurgency began in 2001. While the province remained relatively calm for most of January, violence surged dramatically in the final two days. Coordinated attacks by the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) across at least 12 locations, followed by intensified security operations, placed the province at the centre of the conflict.At least 172 militants were killed, the majority in the final two days of last month.Security forces arrested at least 60 suspected militants during the previous month, while militant groups kidnapped eight individuals. In Punjab, 53 militants were arrested, 48 of them from Lahore, the state capital and Pakistan's second-largest city.Meanwhile, no militant attacks were reported in January from Sindh, Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), Islamabad, or the Gilgit-Baltistan region, according to the data.","Combat-related deaths in Pakistan rose 43% month-on-month to 361 in January.
