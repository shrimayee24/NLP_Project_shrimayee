The report, which highlights issues of workplace harassment , gender discrimination , and exploitation of women, has stirred controversy, with Nadda alleging that leaders from the Communist Party are implicated in these issues.""Why delay in justice to the Hema Committee report? What is stopping them (the Kerala government)? What is haunting you? Because you are part and parcel of that...it is something you want to hide because your people are involved,"" Nadda remarked, news agency ANI quoted.He further urged Kerala's chief minister to clarify the involvement of Communist leaders, saying, ""I am very sorry to say that the Hema Committee report very specifically said that Communist party leaders are involved. The chief minister should come out and tell what really happened.""Nadda's comments were made during an event in Palakkad where he interacted with various prominent figures from Kerala.The Hema Committee, led by former high court judge K Hema, was established following a high-profile sexual assault case in 2017 involving a female actor in Kerala. The actor was abducted by five men, assaulted in a moving vehicle, and later filed a police complaint. The committee submitted its findings to Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan in 2018, but the report was only made public on August 19, 2024, five years after its submission.According to the report, many female actors in the Malayalam cinema industry have faced sexual harassment, with some revealing that they were approached inappropriately before starting projects. The report also highlighted instances where female actors felt unsafe in their accommodations, with intoxicated industry workers reportedly knocking on their doors. Despite these concerns, many victims hesitated to report the harassment to the police, fearing repercussions.In response to the growing allegations of sexual harassment within the Malayalam film industry, the Kerala government has decided to form a special investigation team led by senior women police officers under the leadership of IG Sparjan Kumar.Several prominent figures from the Malayalam film industry, including former general secretaries of the Association of Malayalam Movie Artists (AMMA) Siddique and Edavela Babu, filmmaker Ranjith, and actors Mukesh, Sudheesh, and Riyas Khan, have been publicly accused of sexual harassment or misconduct by some women.","BJP National President and union minister JP Nadda criticized the Kerala government for its handling of the Hema Committee report on the Malayalam film industry.

Attacks in Balochistan bid to derail SCO summit in October: Pakistan govt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/attacks-in-balochistan-bid-to-derail-sco-summit-in-october-pakistan-govt/articleshow/112974277.cms,"ISLAMABAD: A surge in daring militant attacks across Pakistan’s volatile provinces of Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has raised questions about the country’s internal security situation . Pakistan interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said the attacks were aimed at derailing the SCO heads of govt meeting in Islamabad on Oct 15-16.Amid heightened political polarisation in Pakistan, both Baloch separatists and Islamic militants, known as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), have intensified their attacks on security personnel and their facilities in the country’s southwest and northwest.The Baloch separatists also target people of Punjabi ethnicity in the province.On Aug 26, more than 70 people were killed in targeted killings and suicide bombings in different districts of Balochistan, while in Kulachi tehsil of Dera Ismail Khan in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.In a separate incident, a senior army officer, Lt Col Khalid Ameer, and three of his relatives, were kidnapped by TTP fighters when they were meeting people on their father’s death in Dera Ismail Khan. The army’s media wing, however, said on Sunday they have been released due to the role played by tribal elders.When the separatist militant outfit, the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), bombed a railway bridge linking Balochistan to the rest of Pakistan, attacked police and military posts, and targeted buses and trucks on a major highway, Pakistan’s Army chief General Asim Munir was meeting General Li Qiaoming, Commander of the People’s Liberation Army, in the garrison city of Rawalpindi. The bombings and shootings on August 25-26 were the deadliest in years in Balochistan, which borders Afghanistan and Iran.Former Balochistan chief minister, Abdul Malik Baloch, said disappointment is pushing people into insurgency. “Many Baloch are losing faith in Islamabad because of what they perceive to be its political intervention in the province. Political activists tell me that democracy here is a fraud. They feel we are wasting their time,” Baloch said.BLA’s coordinated attacks in Balochistan on Aug 25–26 demonstrated their growing strength. It is believed that US military hardware and weaponry have found their way into the hands of Pakistani militant organisations. Military equipment and weapons, worth billions of dollars, were left behind by the US and international forces following their withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. BLA’s acquisition of modern weapons, security experts believe, has enhanced its combat capabilities.Majority of BLA’s sophisticated strikes are thought to have been executed by the group’s suicide squad, known as Majeed Brigade.Islamabad blames Kabul for patronising Baloch separatists and the TTP. Qari Fasihuddin Fitrat, the military chief of Afghan Taliban , denied the accusation saying the militants plan and execute attacks from within Pakistan.","Pakistan interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said the attacks were aimed at derailing the SCO heads of govt meeting in Islamabad on Oct 15-16.

"In alarming sign, US military veterans split publicly over support for Donald Trump",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/in-alarming-sign-us-military-veterans-split-publicly-over-support-for-donald-trump/articleshow/112970591.cms,"WASHINGTON: Alarm bells are starting to go off in the US over a very public and potentially dangerous political schism among military families and veterans, following Donald Trump 's visit to the Arlington National Cemetery last week, ostensibly to honor 13 personnel killed in a suicide bombing in Afghanistan.Under attack from the current administration, veteran groups and Kamala Harris for politicising the event for electoral gains, Trump lashed back on Sunday, posting videos from several families who said they had invited him for the commemoration on the third anniversary of the tragedy, and they were honored he came.A member of one family said they had intimated the White House about the event but did not hear back from the Biden-Harris administration, while some others went so far as to blame the current dispensation for the death of their beloved.At the same time, several military veterans and families of fallen soldiers excoriated Trump for turning a solemn occasion on hallowed ground into a political spectacle and releasing what they characterized as a ""campaign video."" The clash is now turning bitter, with questions ranging from who was responsible for the debacle in Afghanistan to what constitutes patriotism.The disquiet among family members of the fallen and surviving veterans had been simmering for five days when Kamala Harris jumped into the fray over the weekend purportedly provoked by criticism that neither she not Biden went for the event.""As Vice President, I have had the privilege of visiting Arlington National Cemetery several times. It is a solemn place; a place where we come together to honor American heroes who have made the ultimate sacrifice in service of this nation,"" Harris said in a statement, excoriating Trump for turning a private event into a ""political stunt.""""This is nothing new from Donald Trump. This is a man who has called our fallen service members “suckers” and “losers” and disparaged Medal of Honor recipients. A man who, during a previous visit to the cemetery, reportedly said of fallen service members, “I don’t get it. What was in it for them?” This is a man who is unable to comprehend anything other than service to himself,"" she lashed out, adding that someone who cannot show respect and gratitude to the military ""should never again stand behind the seal of the President of the United States of America.""Several veterans also pilloried the former president on social media, with one group, VoteVets, releasing an ad showing Trump as a draft dodger ""who ran to a quack doctor when the draft board called his number."" On X, a former green beret tweeted, ""I'm outraged beyond words at the despicable behavior of Trump ...We can't allow this convicted felon and draft dodger anywhere near the White House.""In one squalid interview, shock jock Howard Stern and Trump had joked that avoiding sexually transmitted disease during peccadilloes in New York was his ""personal Vietnam.""Trump had frequently presented himself as a valorous supporter of the military despite a record of avoiding service during the Vietnam War and disparaging the sacrifice of soldiers living and fallen. On one occasion, he publicly mocked a fellow Republican, the late Senator John McCain, a decorated war hero, for being a prisoner of war in Vietnam, saying, “He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren’t captured.”While a few families came out in support of Trump over the Arlington incident, the former President was also institutionally rebuked by the US Army, which has oversight of the Cemetery. ""Participants in the August 26th ceremony and the subsequent Section 60 visit were made aware of federal laws, Army regulations and DoD policies, which clearly prohibit political activities on cemetery grounds. An ANC employee who attempted to ensure adherence to these rules was abruptly pushed aside,” the Army said in the statement, implicitly confirmed a violation and a physical altercation.Trump has also angered some veterans by frequently disparaging at least three senior military generals who served in his administration, including his former chief of staff John Kelly. He has called them ""stupid,"" and has said if he wins a second term, he will fire ""woke generals"" and replace them with those who subscribe to his MAGA doctrine.Trump often invokes ""men and women in uniform"" and praises them, ostensibly in an attempt to elicit support of the military and police in the country, while suggesting Democrats are ""weak on law and order"" and do not know how to use America's military might to keep world peace. But some of his own MAGA followers are isolationists and anti-interventionists who believe Democrats are war mongers.","Alarm bells are starting to go off in the US over a very public and potentially dangerous political schism.

Poll insights and campaign implications

The 2024 presidential race tightened as Vice President Kamala Harris narrowly led Donald Trump , according to the latest poll data . With less than two months remaining until Election Day , Harris gained momentum and held a slight edge over her Republican rival.A new ABC News/Ipsos poll, released on Sunday, revealed that Harris led Trump 50% to 46% among all adults and registered voters.Among likely voters, Harris’ lead widened to 52% compared to Trump’s 46%. This result was consistent with polling conducted before the Democratic National Convention, where Harris stood at 49% and Trump at 45%.Pollsters noted that while most numbers remained stable since August, Harris gained ground among women, now leading by 13 points (54% to 41%), up from a 6-point lead before the convention. Harris also received higher marks for her campaign, with 56% of Americans rating her performance as excellent or good, compared to 41% for Trump.Harris outperformed Trump in the battleground states, maintaining a slight advantage within the margins of error in nearly every national survey. NBC News reported that Harris fared better against Trump than Biden did before his exit, indicating growing confidence in her leadership.The concept of a margin of error, as explained by Pew Research, refers to the range within which a survey result is expected to fall relative to the true population value. While Harris' lead was within this range, it underscored the competitive nature of the race.Despite Harris’ lead, Trump maintained advantages in areas critical to voters. He outperformed Harris on trust regarding key issues such as the economy and inflation, leading by 8 points in each category. Trump also had a 9-point lead over Harris on handling the US-Mexico border. However, Harris was perceived as more trustworthy on protecting American democracy and Supreme Court appointments.The latest polling index by The Hill and Decision Desk HQ also showed Harris with a 3.8-point national lead over Trump. The ABC News/Ipsos poll, conducted from August 23-27 with 2,496 completed interviews, had a margin of sampling error of 2.1 percentage points at the 95% confidence level.Despite Harris' gains, Trump remained a formidable opponent, consistently polling at around 47% nationwide. Polls conducted by The Wall Street Journal, EPIC-MRA in Michigan, and Bloomberg/Morning Consult in Georgia and Michigan all placed Trump at this level of support. However, the overall trend showed a reversal in fortunes since Biden's departure, with Harris now holding a narrow edge.Swing state polls revealed a complex and evolving landscape. Bloomberg/Morning Consult polls indicated that Harris had overtaken Trump within the margin of error in Georgia (50%), Michigan (49%), Nevada (50%), and Pennsylvania (51%). In Wisconsin, she held a more decisive lead at 53%, while she was tied with Trump in Arizona and North Carolina. This sharply contrasted with Biden’s performance in these states, where he struggled to gain traction.Before Harris took over the Democratic ticket, Biden trailed Trump, even before the June 27 debate that further damaged his campaign. Harris, on the other hand, was now seen as a more trusted leader and was performing better across the board.Additional polls from The Wall Street Journal, Quinnipiac, and Suffolk/USA Today also showed Harris in the lead, with percentages ranging from 48% to 49%. Trump remained close behind, polling between 43% and 48% in these surveys.The ABC News/Ipsos poll reflected Harris’ ability to leverage her campaign effectively, despite the race remaining highly competitive. Trump, while maintaining a solid base, faced challenges in closing the gap with Harris, who managed to capitalize on recent Democratic momentum.As both campaigns intensified their efforts, the upcoming weeks were crucial in determining whether Harris could sustain her lead or if Trump would make a comeback. With the presidential election just around the corner, all eyes were on how these dynamics evolved.","A new ABC News/Ipsos poll, released on Sunday, revealed that Harris led Trump 50% to 46% among all adults and registered voters.

Ukraine's military officials on Monday said that the country's air defense units were actively engaged in countering a barrage of drones, cruise and multiple Russian missile attack on Kyiv .Ukraine experienced nationwide air raid alerts, while neighbouring Nato member Poland activated Polish and allied aircraft to ensure the safety of its airspace.A Russian missile attack on Kyiv partially destroyed a boiler house at a water plant in the city's Holosiivskyi district, and a fire broke out in the Shevchenkivskyi district, which is home to several educational institutions.Medical personnel are on the scene providing assistance, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on the Telegram messaging app.Emergency services were dispatched to the Svyatoshynksyi, Holosiivskyi, and Solomyanskyi districts, he added.Earlier on Sunday, Ukraine conducted multiple drone assault on Russia, targeting power plants and an oil refinery, marking one of the largest attacks since the full-scale war commenced, officials said. Meanwhile, Russian forces continued to make advancements towards a crucial town in eastern Ukraine.In the Russian missile attack on Kharkiv, at least 47 people, including five children, were injured when missiles hit a shopping mall and events complex in the northeastern Ukrainian city.The attack comes at a pivotal moment in the two-and-a-half-year conflict, as Russia intensifies its offensive in eastern Ukraine while attempting to repel Ukrainian forces that breached its western border in a surprise incursion on August 6.Last week, Russia launched its most intense airstrikes of the war, targeting key sites including energy facilities, in the heaviest aerial assault since the conflict began in February 2022.In response to the escalating Russian aggression, Ukraine has bolstered its domestic drone production capabilities and intensified its own strikes on Russian energy, military, and transportation facilities.Following the attack in Kharkiv, which authorities reported involved a minimum of 10 missiles and impacted various sites, President Zelenskyy on his Telegram channel said: ""All necessary forces for the rescue operation have been brought in.""""And all the necessary forces of the world must be brought in to stop this terror.

This renewed push comes in response to Harris’s stance on the Gaza conflict , which the campaign criticizes as inadequate.The campaign's statement on X last week condemned Harris for her support of policies they claim contribute to ongoing violence in Gaza.“We are not interested in hollow rhetoric or empty platitudes,” the campaign said, criticizing Harris for not addressing their concerns about the Gaza situation.Originally based in Dearborn, Michigan—a city with a large Muslim population—the campaign initially focused on President Biden’s re-election campaign, arguing that his support for Israel was problematic. The campaign successfully mobilized over 100,000 voters to cast uncommitted ballots in Michigan during the primaries.Following Biden's withdrawal from the race and Harris's ascension as the Democratic nominee, the campaign shifted its focus to Harris. The group’s criticism of Harris highlights their dissatisfaction with her response to their demands for policy changes regarding Gaza.The campaign's influence is expanding to other critical swing states such as Wisconsin. These states, which have been decided by narrow margins in previous elections, are now seeing significant mobilization efforts from the campaign. According to Real Clear Politics Polling average, Harris has narrow leads in both Michigan (1.1 points) and Wisconsin (1.4 points).The campaign is also targeting additional swing states, having gained traction in Minnesota during the primary season. Although they have not endorsed any third-party candidate, the campaign urges Muslim-American voters to explore alternatives to the major parties as a protest against their stance on Gaza.A spokesperson for the campaign mentioned their efforts to engage with Harris, stating, “We have extended an olive branch to Kamala Harris and expressed our openness to dialogue. However, after her recent rally in Michigan and her response to our concerns, we launched Abandon Harris on August 19.”The spokesperson added that while they do not support former President Donald Trump, they emphasize that abstaining from voting is not an option. “We have consistently urged voters not to support either the Democratic or Republican parties,” they said.The Harris campaign has not yet responded to requests for comment.

The sixth, Carmel Gat, 40, was abducted from the farming community of Be'eri.The army said the bodies were recovered from a tunnel in Rafah, around a kilometre from where another hostage was rescued alive last week.Initially, Hamas did not directly address the accusations, but said responsibility for the deaths lay with Israel.

Jeff Walz declared that he is not supporting his brother and Kamala Harris. He said Tim Walz is not the type of person who should decide America's future.Jeff is open about his differences with Tim with whom he has not spoken in eight years. The revelation was made in a Facebook post which made the Republicans jump in joy -- only to be reminded by the Democrats that Trump and Kennedy Jr too do not have much of a family support.67-year-old Jeff is Tim's elder brother with zero faith in Tim. He's contemplating publicly endorsing Donald Trump but is not sure whether he should drag the entire family in it. “The stories I could tell. Not the type of character you want making decisions about your future,” he said adding that Tim did not inform the family that he was running for the vice president.Jeff has always been a Trump supporter, a registered Republican who donated $20 to Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. On March 30, 2023 when Trump was indicted by a Manhattan grand jury over hush money payments made to porn star Stormy Daniels, Jeff wrote: ""We've just become a third world banana republic.""Jeff lives on the Florida panhandle in Freeport with his wife Laurie.

The initial plan was for PM Shehbaz Sharif to inaugurate it on Aug 14 alongside Chinese officials, but that was called off after an ethnic Baloch rights group started a sit-in protest, the officials said. Following the attacks, two officials at CAA and two others in the provincial govt said the start of flights would be delayed as authorities review security in the region.Pakistan's military, meanwhile, said it had killed five insurgents and wounded three others in intelligence-based operations launched in the province in response to the attacks. ""Operations will continue until all perpetrators, facilitators and abetters are brought to justice,"" the army said.","The $200-million airport in Gwadar, a joint venture between Pakistan, Oman and China, is close to completion.
