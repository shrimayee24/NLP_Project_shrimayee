Pak Army Hit By Ammunition Shortage; Artillery Stockpile Near Zero Amid War Fear | India Ready!

NEW DELHI: The UN Security Council (UNSC) will hold closed consultations on Monday about the situation between India and Pakistan. Pakistan had asked for an emergency meeting on the issue. Pakistan is currently a non-permanent member of the 15-nation Security Council, which is being led by Greece for the month of May.Pakistan ""requested closed consultations"" over the growing tensions, and the Greek Presidency scheduled the meeting for May 5 in the afternoon.Pakistan said on Sunday that it will ""inform"" the UNSC about what it called India's ""aggressive actions"".""Pakistan will inform the UNSC about India's aggressive actions, provocations, and provocative statements,"" the Pakistan's foreign office said.""Pakistan will specifically highlight India's illegal actions to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty,"" it said, adding that the country would clarify how New Delhi's actions are jeopardising ""peace and security"" in the region.The Security Council has five permanent members with veto power: China, France, Russia, the UK, and the US. The ten non-permanent members are Algeria, Denmark, Greece, Guyana, Pakistan, Panama, South Korea, Sierra Leone, Slovenia, and Somalia.Tensions between India and Pakistan have increased following the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam. The Permanent Representative of Greece to the UN and the Security Council president for May, Ambassador Evangelos Sekeris, said last week that a meeting should take place if there is a request.""Then… I think this meeting should take place because, as we said, maybe it’s also an opportunity to have views expressed and this might help to diffuse a bit of tension,"" Sekeris said.""We are in close contact...but this is something which might happen, I would say, sooner rather than later. We will see, we are preparing,"" he added.News agency PTI reported that when it asked Sekeris about India being affected by cross-border terrorism from Pakistan, which is now on the Council, and the need to deal with terrorism, he said, ""It’s an issue which is very pertinent.""He added, ""As I said before, as a position of principle, we strongly condemn any act of terrorism and this is what we did"" on the ""heinous terrorist attack"" in Pahalgam, in which civilians were killed.Sekeris further said, ""We express our condolences to the government of India, Nepal and the families of victims. This is a position of principle. We condemn terrorism in all its forms, everywhere it is happening. On the other hand, we are concerned about this tension which is mounting in the region. Two very big countries. Of course, India is far more bigger"" than Pakistan.After the Pahalgam attack in which 26 civilians died, external affairs minister S Jaishankar spoke with all Council members except China and Pakistan, as per a report by the news agency PTI.He told them that ""its perpetrators, backers and planners must be brought to justice.""Jaishankar had a ""good conversation"" with Greek foreign minister George Gerapetritis and ""discussed the Pahalgam terrorist attack.""India welcomed Greece’s strong stand against cross-border terrorism. Jaishankar said their ""Strategic Partnership reflects the depth of our ties.""He also spoke with UN secretary general Antonio Guterres and the foreign ministers of Russia, the US, the UK, France, South Korea, Denmark, Sierra Leone, Algeria, Guyana, Slovenia, Somalia, and Panama.Last Friday, Pakistan’s permanent representative to the UN, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, said at a press conference that Pakistan has the right to ask for a meeting when it feels it is needed.""We see that all of this that is happening is in the context, in the backdrop of the situation in Jammu and Kashmir,"" Ahmad said.""Here it is evident that there was an incident but now what has evolved in terms of the situation which is a real threat to regional and international peace and security, and we believe that the Security Council, in fact, has the mandate, and it would be very legitimate for any member of the Council, including Pakistan, to request a meeting, a discussion of the Security Council, to consider this very serious situation that has evolved. We have discussed that with the Council members. We have discussed that with the in fact, the previous, last month’s presidency, and this month’s presidency. We are observing the situation very closely, and we have the right to convene a meeting when we feel appropriate,"" he added.Ahmad also met UN Secretary General Guterres last week and gave him a briefing about the situation in the region.Earlier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on April 24 said that the people behind the Pahalgam terror attack and those supporting them will be punished. In a meeting on April 29 with senior defence officials, Modi said that the armed forces have ""complete operational freedom"" to choose how, when, and where to respond to the attack, news agency PTI reported, quoting government sources.","The UN Security Council (UNSC) will hold closed consultations on Monday about the situation between India and Pakistan. Pakistan is currently a non-permanent member of the 15-nation Security Council.

BHOPAL: Police have rescued 16 mentally challenged and destitute men held in modern-day slavery for years - some for two decades - under inhumane conditions in two villages in MP's Guna district, arresting 11 people linked to a widespread trafficking and bonded labour network spanning many states.""They were treated worse than animals,"" an officer involved in the rescue said.The victims - rescued from Binaganj and Cachoda areas, 150km from Bhopal and close to Rajasthan border - were trapped under a local exploitation system known as 'Rahua', a term derived from the regional dialect meaning 'Raho aur Khao' - stay and eat. But behind the seemingly benign phrase lies a brutal form of bondage. Victims were forced to work long hours in return for nothing more than leftover food and a place to sleep, often among cattle. There were no wages, no basic rights, and no way out. Most of the men had been trafficked after being found wandering on highways or abandoned by truck drivers. Once in captivity,they were roped into a network of forced labour across agricultural fields, cattle sheds, brick kilns, roadside eateries, and homes.District collector Kishore Kumar Kanyal said 16 men have been shifted to care centres in Shivpuri, where they are receiving medical and psychological support. Their families are being located.","Police rescue 16 mentally challenged and destitute men held in modern-day slavery. 11 people arrested linked to widespread trafficking and bonded labour network.

Poll Should all individuals involved in a gangrape be held equally responsible? No Yes

Common intention is essence of joint liability: SC

NEW DELHI: Holding that it is not necessary for the prosecution to adduce clinching proof of complete act of rape by each one of the accused to convict all for gangrape, Supreme Court has reiterated that in cases of gangrape, even if one commits rape, all the other persons involved should be held responsible and be equally punished.A bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and K V Viswanathan rejected the plea of an accused who claimed that he was not named along with other accused by the survivor in the FIR and his role was confined to helping the main accused.Rejecting the plea, the bench said, ""In a case of gangrape under Section 376(2)(g), an act by one is enough to render all in the gang for punishment as long as they have acted in furtherance of the common intention. Further, common intention is implicit in the charge of Section 376(2)(g) itself and all that is needed is evidence to show the existence of common intention.""Referring to earlier SC verdicts, the bench said in order to establish an offence under Section 376(2)(g) IPC, the prosecution must adduce evidence to indicate that more than one accused had acted in concert and in such an event, if rape had been committed by even one, all the accused would be guilty irrespective of the fact that the woman had been raped by one or more of them and it was not necessary for the prosecution to adduce evidence of a completed act of rape by each one of the accused.In other words, this provision embodies a principle of joint liability and the essence of that liability is the existence of common intention; that common intention presupposes prior concert which may be determined from the conduct of offenders revealed during the course of action and it could arise and be formed suddenly, but there must be meeting of minds and it is not enough to have the same intention independently of each of the offenders,"" it said.","Justices Sanjay Karol and K V Viswanathan rejected the plea of an accused who claimed that he was not named along with other accused by the survivor in the FIR.

FEROZEPUR: A 30-minute blackout drill from 9pm Sunday in Punjab's Ferozepur Cantonment , along the India-Pakistan border , harked back to the 1971 War when it had become routine to order lights off to reduce visibility for enemy aircraft.Ferozepur Cantonment Board had intimated residents in advance about the power cut as part of a safety preparedness exercise. As the cantonment area plunged into darkness, the only light was from headlamps of vehicles being stopped for frisking at multiple checkpoints on the highway.Residents were mostly cooped up in their homes, keeping even personal generators and inverters switched off for the entire duration of the drill.Hooters pierced the night air continuously, heightening the feeling of an emergency despite everyone knowing that it was a mock exercise.The cantonment board's official statement described the temporary blackout as being part of ""routine safety preparedness"" involving the public. ""This mock drill is being conducted in the interest of public safety, and we greatly appreciate the cooperation and understanding of all residents,"" the statement said, assuring the residents that normal power supply would resume immediately after the drill ended at 9.30pm.Sure enough, lights came on at the designated time. By then, generations who hadn't experienced 1971 knew what it felt like back then.","Ferozepur Cantonment Board intimated residents in advance about the power cut as part of a safety preparedness exercise.

A former FBI official on MSNBC's Morning Joe program commented that FBI director Kash Patel, despite the fear that was spread ahead of his confirmation that he would dismantle the system if he became the FBI director, has surprisingly taken a backseat.Former FBI counter-intelligence official Frank Figliuzzi said Kash Patel is spotted more at nightclubs and less at the office, but people are not complaining because they think things would have been bad, had he been trying to run them, given his experience or the lack of it.""Yeah well, reportedly, he's been visible at nightclubs far more than he has been on the seventh floor of the Hoover building,"" Figliuzzi replied. ""And there are reports that daily briefings to him have been changed from every day to maybe twice weekly.

If he's not plugged in, things could be bad.

"" People don't know what's happening from day to day.

Donald Trump finally doused the speculations of Trump 2028 after his organization launched merchandise, and clarified in NBC's Meet the Press that he would leave the White House at the end of his second term. As successors, he named Vice President JD Vance, secretary of state Marco Rubio and said they are doing great.Weeks ago, he refused to endorse JD Vance for 2028 and doubled down that he gets a lot of requests from his party members to run again in 2028 - which is not permissible by the Constitution, but he said there are many loopholes that would allow him to run for a third time. He even said that he was not joking when he spoke about running for a third time.In an exclusive interview with NBC's Meet the Press, Trump said, ""I’ll be an eight-year president, I’ll be a two-term president. I always thought that was very important.”The Constitution’s 22nd Amendment says “no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.” Amending the Constitution to abolish that limit would be extremely difficult, requiring the support of either two-thirds of both the House and Senate or two-thirds of state legislatures. Another method came into discussion that Donald Trump would be running for the vice president along with JD Vance as the president. If they win, the president could resign to make way for the vice president to take over.“I think [Vance’s] a fantastic, brilliant guy,” he said. “Marco is great. There’s a lot of them that are great. I also see tremendous unity. But certainly you would say that somebody’s the VP, if that person is outstanding, I guess that person would have an advantage.”“But I think the other people would all stay in unbelievably high positions,” he added. “But you know, it could be that he’d be challenged by somebody.

Saquon Barkley’s golf day with Donald Trump triggers mixed reactions

Fiancée Anna Congdon’s old tweets resurface and stir more backlash

Philadelphia Eagles star running back Saquon Barkley has found himself at the center of controversy following a high-profile weekend with former President Donald Trump and the resurfacing of old, offensive tweets by his fiancée, Anna Congdon. The firestorm comes during what should have been a celebratory moment: the Eagles’ Super Bowl victory visit to the White House.Just days before the team’s scheduled visit to the White House, Saquon Barkley joined Donald Trump for a round of golf at the former president’s Bedminster, N.J. club. Barkley even flew to Washington aboard Air Force One with Trump, with cameras capturing them stepping off Marine One together. Trump joked, “I wanted to race him, but I decided not to do it,” calling the Pro Bowl athlete “a nice guy.”But the images sparked online outrage, especially given the political tension surrounding Trump. Critics accused Barkley of aligning himself with a divisive figure right before a non-partisan team event.Barkley responded directly on social media, writing: “Get out of my mentions with all this politics. Some people are really upset ’cause I played golf and flew to the White House with the PRESIDENT… Maybe I just respect the office, not a hard concept to understand.” He also pointed out that he had previously golfed with Barack Obama, emphasizing his stance on respecting the presidency, not the politics.While Barkley was defending his Trump appearance, his fiancée, Anna Congdon, came under fire for a different reason. Social media users resurfaced tweets she made as a teenager in 2012 and 2013 that contained racial slurs and insensitive language, including casual use of the N-word. The tweets drew heavy criticism, especially since Congdon and Barkley have a biracial child.Though the posts were over a decade old, many questioned whether they reflected deeper views. Neither Congdon nor Barkley has commented on the matter publicly, but the timing of the leak — just ahead of the Super Bowl — raised suspicion about the motives behind it.The Eagles' visit to the White House was notable not just for Barkley's presence, but also for the absence of key players, including quarterback Jalen Hurts, A.J. Brown, and DeVonta Smith. While the official explanation was “scheduling conflicts,” the silent boycott echoed past tensions with Trump-era politics.Also Read: “Turning sports into reality TV”: Kelly Stafford urges balance between public curiosity and privacy in Bill Belichick and Jordon Hudson’s relationship Ultimately, Barkley’s actions and the resurfaced tweets have reignited debate over how athletes engage with politics and public figures — and whether personal gestures can ever truly be separated from public perception.",Philadelphia Eagles star running back Saquon Barkley has found himself at the center of controversy following a high-profile weekend with former President Donald Trump.

Trump plans to reopen Alcatraz to jail 'dregs of society': 10 things to know about the infamous prison,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-plans-to-reopen-alcatraz-to-jail-dregs-of-society-10-things-to-know-about-the-infamous-prison/articleshow/120887155.cms,"Here are 10 things to know about Alcatraz:

The name Alcatraz comes from the Spanish “Alcatraces,” meaning pelicans or strange birds. It was named by explorer Juan Manuel de Ayala in 1775. In 1850, the island was set aside for military use and became part of a “triangle of defence” for San Francisco Bay. It also housed the West Coast’s first lighthouse.

The US Army built a fortress on the island in the 1850s and later used it as a military prison. Between 1909 and 1911, prisoners themselves helped construct a new prison building.

Alcatraz became a federal penitentiary in 1934, intended for the “worst of the worst” prisoners—those who caused trouble in other federal facilities.

Notable inmates included mob boss Al Capone, kidnapper George “Machine Gun” Kelly, and murderer Robert Stroud, known as the Birdman of Alcatraz.

Conditions were harsh. Most cells were just 9 feet by 5 feet, with minimal furnishings. However, inmates did receive hot showers and were fed some of the best meals in the US prison system.

The most famous escape attempt happened in 1962 when Frank Morris and brothers John and Clarence Anglin vanished from their cells. They used a raft made of raincoats. Though presumed drowned, no bodies were ever found.



Alcatraz was a self-contained community. Around 300 civilians, including guards and their families, lived on the island. Children who lived there took a boat to school on the mainland daily.

The prison closed in 1963, not due to an escape, but because of its extreme operating costs. It was three times more expensive to run than other federal prisons.

After closure, the island saw an occupation by Native American activists in 1969, which lasted 19 months and ended in a federal eviction.

Today, Alcatraz is a major tourist attraction, drawing around 1.4 million visitors each year. It is part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and includes historic buildings, gardens, and a lighthouse



President Donald Trump on Monday called for the rebuilding and reopening of the infamous Alcatraz prison, as part of a broader crackdown on violent crime. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said, “REBUILD, AND OPEN ALCATRAZ!” and criticised “vicious, violent, and repeat Criminal Offenders” as “the dregs of society.”He argued that when the US was a “more serious Nation”, dangerous criminals were locked away without hesitation, adding, “That’s the way it’s supposed to be.” Trump announced he is directing the Bureau of Prisons, Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security to reopen a “substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ” to house the country’s most dangerous offenders.Often referred to as “The Rock,” Alcatraz was one of the most notorious federal penitentiaries in the United States, housing criminals like Al Capone and George ""Machine Gun"" Kelly. Located on a rocky island in San Francisco Bay, it operated from 1934 until 1963 before closing due to high maintenance costs and logistical challenges.","Alcatraz was a federal penitentiary in San Francisco Bay from 1934 to 1963.

Tricked, trapped, tortured: Survivors recount horrors of forced labour

BHOPAL: Police have arrested eleven people after rescuing 16 mentally challenged and destitute men from two villages in Madhya Pradesh ’s Guna district. The victims, some held in captivity for as long as two decades, were forced into slavery and bonded labour through a local exploitative system known as ‘ Rahua ’.'Rahua', a local exploitation system, derives its name from the regional dialect phrase 'Raho aur Khao', which translates to ""stay and eat"".This deceptively simple term conceals a harsh system of bondage where individuals were compelled to work extensive hours, receiving only scraps of food and accommodation amongst livestock as compensation. The victims were denied wages, fundamental rights and any possibility of escape.The majority of these labourers were individuals who had been trafficked after being discovered wandering on highways or left behind by lorry drivers.Their captors forced them into various forms of labour across farms, animal shelters, brick manufacturing units, roadside restaurants and residential properties. These individuals, stripped of their personal identity, endured years of enforced servitude without any voice.One of the survivor recounted his previous employment at a government establishment before becoming disoriented whilst travelling. He described how an unknown person gained his trust, subsequently deceived him, imprisoned him and compelled him into forced labour. His captors assigned him tasks of maintaining livestock shelters and gathering animal waste, whilst subjecting him to physical abuse whenever he showed opposition or became unwell.Another survivor recounted how he was deceived with promises of meals and accommodation during his time of poverty, only to be forced into servitude for multiple years. His movements were severely restricted, and he remained under continuous surveillance. The captors reportedly warned him of being 'hunted down and punished' should he attempt to flee from their control.Another survivor, who previously worked at a small restaurant in a neighbouring state, recounted being picked up whilst seeking a lift and transported to Binaganj with deceptive job offers. At the location, he was forced to tend to buffaloes, remove dung, and labour from sunrise to nightfall without compensation. His sleeping arrangements consisted of the uncovered ground adjacent to the animals, whilst his sustenance was limited to stale roti and water.“They were treated worse than animals,” an officer involved in the rescue operation said.The rescue operation, conducted jointly by the labour department, district police, revenue, and municipal officials, exposed the full extent of the abuse and the trafficking network behind it.“We have arrested 11 people and are looking for another accused. Investigations are on to trace their origins and the people involved in trafficking them,” Guna SP Amit Soni told TOI.After undergoing initial medical screening at the Binaganj health centre, the rescued men were shifted to the Apna Ghar Ashram in Shivpuri.The victims, originating from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Odisha, Gujarat, and Jharkhand, reflect the wide interstate reach of the trafficking network.","Police arrest 11 people after rescuing 16 mentally challenged and destitute men from two villages in Madhya Pradesh’s Guna district.

BEIJING: Four boats capsized in a sudden storm on a river in southwestern China, leaving nine dead and one missing, state media said Monday. More than 80 people fell into the Wu River when strong winds hit the scenic area in Guizhou province on Sunday afternoon, state broadcaster CCTV said.Initial reports said two tourist boats had capsized, but CCTV and the official Xinhua News Agency said Monday that four boats were involved. It wasn't clear if any of the victims were on the other two boats.The boats capsized after a sudden rain and hail storm hit the Wu, a tributary of the Yangtze, China's longest river. In one video shared by state media, a man could be seen performing CPR on another person, while one of the vessels drifted upside down.Guizhou's mountains and rivers are a major tourism draw, and many Chinese are traveling during a five-day national holiday that ends Monday.Chinese President Xi Jinping called for ""all-out efforts"" to find the missing and care for the injured, Xinhua said on Sunday.Xi's administration has pushed to reduce the death toll in China's transportation sector, but overloading, poorly maintained vehicles and a lack of safety equipment have frustrated those efforts, particularly during major holidays.CCTV said two of the capsized boats each had about 40 people on board and were not overloaded.An eyewitness told state-owned Beijing News that the waters were deep but some people had managed to swim to safety. However, the storm had come suddenly and a thick mist obscured the surface of the river.","More than 80 people fell into the Wu River when strong winds hit the scenic area in Guizhou province.

NEW YORK: President Donald Trump says he is directing his government to reopen and expand Alcatraz, the notorious former prison on a hard-to-reach California island off San Francisco that has been closed for more than 60 years.In a post on his Truth Social site Sunday evening, Trump wrote that, ""For too long, America has been plagued by vicious, violent, and repeat Criminal Offenders, the dregs of society, who will never contribute anything other than Misery and Suffering. When we were a more serious Nation, in times past, we did not hesitate to lock up the most dangerous criminals, and keep them far away from anyone they could harm. That's the way it's supposed to be.""""That is why, today,"" he said, ""I am directing the Bureau of Prisons , together with the Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security, to reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ, to house America's most ruthless and violent Offenders.""Trump's directive to rebuild and reopen the long-shuttered penitentiary was the latest salvo in his effort to overhaul how and where federal prisoners and immigration detainees are locked up. But such a move would likely be an expensive and challenging proposition. The prison was closed in 1963 due to crumbling infrastructure and the high costs of repairing and supplying the island facility, because everything from fuel to food had to be brought by boat.Bringing the facility up to modern-day standards would require massive investments at a time when the Bureau of Prisons has been shuttering prisons for similar infrastructure issues.The prison, infamously inescapable due to the strong ocean currents and cold Pacific waters that surround it, was known as the ""The Rock"" and housed some of the nation's most notorious criminals, including gangster Al Capone and George ""Machine Gun"" Kelly.It has long been part of the cultural imagination and has been the subject of numerous movies, including ""The Rock"" starring Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage.Still in the 29 years it was open, 36 men attempted 14 separate escapes, according to the FBI. Nearly all were caught or didn't survive the attempt.The fate of three particular inmates - John Anglin, his brother Clarence and Frank Morris, is of some debate and was dramatized in the 1979 film ""Escape from Alcatraz"" starring Clinton Eastwood.Alcatraz Island is now a major tourist site that is operated by the National Park Service and is a designated National Historic Landmark.Trump, returning to the White House on Sunday night after a weekend in Florida, said he'd come up with the idea because of frustrations with ""radicalized judges"" who have insisted those being deported receive due process. Alcatraz, he said, has long been a ""symbol of law and order. You know, it's got quite a history.""A spokesperson for the bureau of prisons said in a statement that the agency ""will comply with all Presidential Orders."" The spokesperson did not immediately answer questions from The Associated Press regarding the practicality and feasibility of reopening Alcatraz or the agency's role in the future of the former prison given the National park service's control of the island.Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat whose district includes the island, questioned the feasibility of reopening the prison after so many years. ""It is now a very popular national park and major tourist attraction. The President's proposal is not a serious one,"" she wrote on X.The island serves as a veritable time machine to a bygone era of corrections. The Bureau of Prisons currently has 16 penitentiaries performing the same high-security functions as Alcatraz, including its maximum security facility in Florence, Colorado, and the US penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana, which is home to the federal death chamber.The order comes as Trump has been clashing with the courts as he tries to send accused gang members to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador, without due process. Trump has also floated the legally dubious idea of sending some federal US prisoners to the Terrorism Confinement Center, known as CECOT.Trump has also directed the opening of a detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to hold up to 30,000 of what he has labeled the ""worst criminal aliens.""The bureau of prisons has faced myriad crises in recent years and has been subjected to increased scrutiny after Jeffrey Epstein's suicide at a federal jail in New York City in 2019. An AP investigation uncovered deep, previously unreported flaws within the bureau of prisons. AP reporting has disclosed widespread criminal activity by employees, dozens of escapes, chronic violence, deaths and severe staffing shortages that have hampered responses to emergencies, including assaults and suicides.The AP's investigation also exposed rampant sexual abuse at a federal women's prison in Dublin, California. Last year, President Joe Biden signed a law strengthening oversight of the agency after AP reporting spotlighted its many flaws.At the same time, the bureau of prisons is operating in a state of flux, with a recently installed new director and a redefined mission that includes taking in thousands of immigration detainees at some of its prisons and jails under an agreement with the department of homeland security. The agency last year closed several facilities, in part to cut costs, but is also in the process of building a new prison in Kentucky.",President Donald Trump says he is directing his government to reopen and expand Alcatraz. The notorious former prison on a hard-to-reach California island off San Francisco has been closed for more than 60 years. The prison was closed in 1963 due to crumbling infrastructure and the high costs of repairing and supplying the facility.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120887136,imgsize-502492,width-400,resizemode-4/US-President-Donald-Trump-AI.jpg"

Taiwan plans stricter rules for officials' travel to China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/taiwan-plans-stricter-rules-for-officials-travel-to-china/articleshow/120886754.cms,"Lai Ching-te, Taiwanese President (ANI)

TAIPEI: Taiwan is weighing stricter controls on travel to China by legislators and elected officials, potentially requiring prior approval to prevent infiltration efforts by Beijing, a national security official said on Saturday, Taipei Times reported.The move comes amid growing concerns over the exposure of sensitive information through unofficial or undocumented exchanges during such visits.President William Lai, in March, had unveiled a package of 17 countermeasures targeting Chinese infiltration , with a focus on ensuring transparency in the travel of civil servants to China. The measures aim to make officials publicly accountable for their cross-strait movements and limit opportunities for covert influence operations.According to the official, the government is considering amending the act governing Relations between the People of the Taiwan Area and Mainland Area to standardise travel regulations across all levels of public service. The proposed changes would apply to military personnel, civil servants, borough wardens, elected officials, and lawmakers, reported Taipei Times.""As these people exercise public authority, they are prime targets of Chinese infiltration, and their trips to China should be open and transparent,"" the official said.""The Legislative Yuan is a national security loophole,"" they said, pointing out that lawmakers currently are not obligated to seek approval for China trips despite having access to sensitive national information. Moreover, the legislature does not disclose which of its members handle classified data, unlike other government agencies that follow strict security reporting protocols.Under the proposed system, travel oversight would be implemented through a tiered approach. ""Grassroots civil servants would not be required to obtain permission to travel to China, but would have to publicly disclose their travel,"" the official said. In contrast, individuals with access to classified information would face tighter scrutiny, with some cases requiring joint reviews and formal approvals, Taipei Times reported.Although lower-level public servants may not handle sensitive material, they remain potential infiltration targets, the official added.Once revisions to the law are in place, a complete set of supporting measures will be rolled out to ensure consistent enforcement and oversight.","Taiwan is weighing stricter controls on travel to China by legislators and elected officials.

Northumbria police on Sunday released 14 children—11 boys and 3 girls—on bail after being arrested on suspicion of manslaughter of a teenager in a fire at a disused industrial building in Gateshead, a town near Newcastle in north-east England.The body found inside the building is believed to be that of Layton Carr, a 14-year-old boy who had been reported missing on Friday.Residents in the area told the BBC that children and teenagers frequently enter the industrial site, which they say has long been left unsecured.A GoFundMe page has been launched to support Layton’s mother, Georgia, with funeral expenses. Organiser Stephanie Simpson wrote, “The last thing Georgia needs is the added stress of trying to cover funeral costs for her boy. Any donation, big or small, will help.

Harris won't be able to be back home, predicts Brazilian psychic Athos Salome



Team Harry vs Team King Charles



Prince Harry gave an explosive interview to the BBC, in which he said he wanted to bury the hatchet with the royal family and that he did not nurse any emotional wound. He revealed that he does not talk to his father, confirming what has long been in speculation -- that he had wanted to get back. But the interview did much damage to his prospects of returning home as it came out of the blue after he lost the legal case of security in the UK.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle resigned from their royal duties in 2020 and left the UK to start a new life in California. Their main grievance was the prying family that choked them like they did to his mother, Princess Diana. His security cover in the UK was withdrawn as a result, but Harry contested that and now he has lost the case. This means if Harry, Meghan and their children come to the UK, they are not under Royal security.The loss converted into a sudden interview that stunned the world as it was clear that the sit-down was being planned in the shadows and Prince Harry was ready to take the Royal Family down once again in public.Psychic Athos Salome , referred to as the ' Living Nostradamus ', told The SUN that Harry will leave California as he feels trapped there though he would not be back in Buckingham, his new home will be a third country.A silent rapprochement with King Charles in possible but it will be only between the fathers and the son. Prince William will remain distant and resentful.After Prince Harry's interview, social media users got divided between team Harry and team Charles -- sparring at the new Royal feud. King Charles was slammed as a pathetic father, after being a pathetic husband to Princess Diana, as Harry revealed that his father does not speak to him.

President Trump offers US help to Mexico against cartels, calls Mexican president “Afraid”

US president Donald Trump said on Sunday that Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum turned down his offer to send American troops into Mexico to help crack down on drug cartels because she was “too afraid” of the cartels to accept his proposal.Trump further said that Sheinbaum was unable to “think straight” because of fear. ""She's so afraid of the cartels she can't walk,"" Trump said to reporters aboard Air Force One. ""And I think she's a lovely woman. The president of Mexico is a lovely woman, but she is so afraid of the cartels that she can't even think straight.""The remarks followed Sheinbaum’sconfirmation that Trump had pressed her during a call last month to let US forces take a larger role in Mexico’s fight against organised crime. Sheinbaum rejected the idea, saying that while cooperation is possible, it must respect national boundaries.“He said, ‘How can we help you fight drug trafficking? I propose that the United States military come in and help you,” Sheinbaum said. “And you know what I said to him? I told him, ‘No, president Trump. Sovereignty is not for sale. Sovereignty is loved and defended.”Trump has taken a more aggressive approach to cross-border crime during his second term. Since January, the US military presence at the southern border has grown. Troops, surveillance aircraft, and equipment have been deployed to target fentanyl trafficking. Trump has also designated several cartels as foreign terrorist organisations, giving US agencies broader powers to act against them.","President Trump offers US help to Mexico against cartels, calls Mexican president “Afraid” Trump has taken a more aggressive approach to cross-border crime during his second term.

""I don't know,"" Trump replied. ""I'm not, I'm not a lawyer. I don't know."" Welker reminded the president that the Fifth Amendment says as much. ""I don't know,"" Trump said again.

In the interview, he went further than he had previously in saying he did not intend to run again, despite the fact that the Trump Organization's online store is selling Trump 2028 hats.

Donald Trump thinks Marco Rubio could be his potential successor. 10 things to know about him,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-thinks-marco-rubio-could-be-his-potential-successor-10-things-to-know-about-him/articleshow/120879262.cms,"Donald Trump said Marco Rubio can also become his successor.

Why Marco Rubio has become so important in the second Trump administration



Marco Rubio is a veteran in politics. He entered politics in 1999, serving in the Florida House of Representatives, where he rose to become Speaker from 2006 to 2008. He later served as a US Senator from Florida from 2011 to 2025. Marco Rubio ran for president in 2016, initially clashing with Trump, who nicknamed him “Li’l Marco,” but later reconciled and became a Trump ally. Rubio became the 72nd US Secretary of State. After the Trump administration dismantled USAID, Marco Rubio was given the responsibility as the acting director of the agency. Marco Rubio was confirmed by the Senate unanimously by a vote of 99-0. Rubio is also the acting archivist for the National Archives. He is wearing so many hats that JD Vance joked that he should become the pope as well. Rubio has been vocal on international issues, condemning Germany’s labeling of the AfD party as extremist, advocating for a nuclear deal with Iran that avoids uranium enrichment. Rubio’s net worth is now estimated at $500,000 to $1 million in 2025, thanks to book royalties, real estate investments, and his government salaries Rubio is married to Jeanette Dousdebes, a former Miami Dolphins cheerleader, and they have four children. When JD Vance said he should become the pope, Rubio deflected, citing his marriage. Marco Rubio was born in Miami, but as the son of Cuban immigrants he has lived the American dream and stands for it as the Trump administration cracks down on illegal immigrants. US visas are not a right but a privilege, Marco Rubio recently wrote explaining Donald Trump's hardline on US visas.

In his interview with MSNBC, US President Donald Trump finally named his potential successors but he did not stop at the obvious choice, Vice President JD Vance who is also the Republicans' favorite candidate for 2028. Trump also mentioned Marco Rubio , the secretary of state who is also the interim NSA of Trump after Mike Waltz's ouster.In the interview, Trump was asked about his successor though he has been steadily hinting so far that he would love to run for another term. Trump said it's too early to name a successor but he has a vice president who is doing a fantastic job.""He would be at the top of the list?"" Trump was asked.""It — it could very well be — I — I don’t want to get involved in that. I think he’s a fantastic, brilliant guy. Marco is great. There’s a lot of them that are great. I — I also see tremendous unity. But certainly you would say that somebody’s the VP, if that person is outstanding, I guess that person would have an advantage,"" Trump said.""But I think the other people would all stay in unbelievably high positions. But you know, it could be that he’d be challenged by somebody. We have a lot of good people in this party,"" Trump said.","Marco Rubio is the 72nd US Secretary of State.

Preliminary injunction awarded to 133 international students who had sued over SEVIS termination,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/preliminary-injunction-awarded-to-133-international-students-who-had-sued-over-sevis-termination/articleshow/120869408.cms,"AI generated image

“We won!” - these words were echoed by 133 international students - perhaps the first cohort of plaintiffs to get a preliminary injunction , in a lawsuit of this size, which challenged the abrupt and unlawful SEVIS terminations.Judge Victoria Marie Calvert of the US district court (for the Northern District of Georgia) issued a preliminary injunction on May 2, converting an earlier temporary restraining order (TRO) into a more lasting protection for the students while their lawsuit against the Trump administration proceeds.The district court had previously directed the US agencies to reinstate the students' status retroactively to March 31, 2025, a directive that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) confirmed it had complied with by manually updating each student's SEVIS record.Charles H. Kuck, founding partner at Kuck Baxter, an immigration law firm, who represented these students told TOI, “We are excited for our 133 plaintiffs who had the courage to challenge this in court. Litigation works, and we have to hold rogue administrative actions accountable.”Also read: All 133 international students, including many Indians, who filed a lawsuit get their SEVIS records restored Read more: Georgia district court provides interim relief as it blocks termination of legal status of 133 international students All 133 international students, many of whom were from India, had proceeded with the lawsuit pseudonymously and had initially sought a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO). The lawsuit was filed against ICE, Department of Homeland Security and the US Attorney General. This lawsuit was prompted by notices received between April 1 and April 14, informing them that their SEVIS records had been terminated—citing either criminal background checks, visa revocations, or alleged failure to maintain lawful status.These international students were either enrolled in colleges and universities throughout the US, or were lawfully undergoing Optional Practical Training . They did not have any criminal history that would warrant their SEVIS records being terminated. Nonetheless, many of them received emails from their Designated School Official (DSO) directing them to leave the US immediately. Without active SEVIS records, students can lose their F-1 visa status , become unlawfully present, and risk deportation, despite being otherwise compliant with immigration rules.The students argued that ICE acted arbitrarily and capriciously by terminating their records without sufficient justification or process. Judge Calvert agreed, concluding the students are likely to succeed on their legal claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).In her 35-page ruling, Judge Calvert stated that the students faced “imminent risk of irreparable harm,” including the loss of legal status, educational opportunities, and career prospects. Contrary to this, the US agencies had claimed that the harm to the international students owing to SEVIS termination was minimal and largely theoretical.ICE claimed that the plaintiffs’ claims under the APA were supplanted by the Privacy Act, which they argued provided an adequate alternative remedy. However, the district court rejected this argument, noting that the Privacy Act does not apply to the plaintiffs as they are neither US citizens nor lawful permanent residents.ICE also argued that the plaintiffs were seeking a mandatory injunction to reverse the termination of their SEVIS records, rather than a prohibitory injunction to preserve the status quo. The court dismissed this argument, clarifying that the status quo refers to the ‘last peaceable uncontested’ status before the dispute arose. ICE contended that the venue of the district court was improper for plaintiffs located outside Georgia and requested dismissal or transfer of their claims. However, the district court overruled this objection.As ICE failed to provide a lawful explanation for the SEVIS terminations and did not submit evidence to support its claims during the hearings, Judge Calvert emphasized that the public has a vested interest in ensuring government agencies follow the law, noting: “There is no public interest in the perpetuation of unlawful agency action.”The order now bars US agencies from terminating or undoing that reinstatement unless authorized by the district court. However, DHS may still take lawful actions under immigration law.In a final move, the judge waived the requirement for the students to post a bond, which is typically required when a court grants injunctive relief, citing the students' good faith and the minimal risk of financial harm to the government.","133 international students, including many Indians, who filed a lawsuit get their SEVIS records restored.
