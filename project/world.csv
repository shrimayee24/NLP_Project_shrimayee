The thick smoke resulted in poor visibility and difficulties in breathing, and a few women staffers who managed to run out of the ground floor and basement stood outside shouting for help.According to eyewitnesses and rescue operation participants, a group of about 15 local residents , most in their 20s, swung into action. From the staff, they took down details of the patients and how to reach the top floors, before entering the building. The ramps built for accessing all the floors provided perfect paths to evacuate the ill.Ramesh, a resident of Rajanukunte, told TOI, “I had come to buy medicines from the pharmacy in the hospital building.

Somehow, we evacuated the people on the ground floor, but entering the first and second floors wasn’t easy.”He continued: “The patients’ attendants were screaming for help. Following their screams, we fanned out across the first and second floors. We broke the glasses of windows and side walls so the smoke could exit the building.

Netanyahu vows Israel will fight alone even without US help,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/netanyahu-vows-israel-will-fight-alone-even-without-us-help/articleshow/109994571.cms,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu struck a defiant tone against President Joe Biden after the US withheld a shipment of bombs as a warning to its top Middle East ally not to invade the southern Gaza city of Rafah.In a first, punchy clip on the social media site X, Netanyahu said: “If we have to stand alone, we will stand alone” and “fight tooth and nail.” He then pivoted to a more conciliatory approach when chatting with Phil McGraw, the American talk show host known as Dr.Phil.“I’ve known Joe Biden for many years, 40 years and more,” Netanyahu said in the interview Thursday on “Dr. Phil Primetime” broadcast on Merit Street Media. “We often had agreements, but we’ve had our disagreements and we’ve been able to overcome them. I hope we can overcome them now.”Netanyahu said Israel must go into Rafah to finish off the remaining battalions of Hamas, the US-designated terrorist group that killed 1,200 Israelis and kidnapped about 250 last Oct. 7. He said Hamas will “murder again and again” if allowed to survive in Rafah.“We have to achieve victory,” he said. “That means we have to destroy all these battalions, which we will. We face very strong opposition to that, but we’re going to overcome it.”Netanyahu said Israel would do its utmost to make sure civilians leave Rafah, where more than a million people are sheltering, before any attack. He also criticized the “madness” of pro-Palestinian rallies on US college campuses, saying protesters are “supporting genocide,” adding that this reflected “the sorry state of American higher education.”On Wednesday, Biden said he would halt additional shipments of offensive weapons to Israel if it launches a ground invasion of Rafah, decrying the potential loss of civilian life as “just wrong.”“We’re going to continue to make sure Israel is secure in terms of Iron Dome and their ability to respond to attacks that came out of the Middle East recently,” Biden said in an interview with CNN, referring to air-defense weaponry. “But it’s just wrong. We’re not going to supply the weapons and artillery shells.”Like Netanyahu, US officials followed sharp criticism with more conciliatory remarks on Thursday.White House officials insisted the US stands by its ally, while urging Netanyahu to refrain from an assault that could worsen the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.Spokesman John Kirby reiterated that the administration paused, but didn’t cancel, the shipment of about 3,500 bombs, which he said was limited to specific munitions that could add to the civilian death toll in Gaza.“The arguments that somehow we’re walking away from Israel flies in the face of the facts,” Kirby told reporters.There were also indications that the White House hadn’t sought an open confrontation with Netanyahu.US officials initially planned to inform the Israeli government privately that the US intended to pause the bomb shipment, in order to ramp up pressure on Netanyahu — but not to follow through unless there was a major incursion into urban areas of Rafah. But that plan was foiled when Israeli officials leaked it, people familiar with the situation said.","Netanyahu says he's known Biden for 40 years, hopes they can overcome their disagreements. He says Israel must go into Rafah to finish off the remaining battalions of Hamas.

Saudi Arabia's stark warning against Israel's Rafah ground operation| seeks Int'l intervention

Has the US ever withheld military aid from Israel before?

American President Joe Biden has warned that the US would not provide offensive weapons to Israel for a potential full-scale assault on Rafah, a critical Hamas stronghold in Gaza. In an interview with CNN, Biden affirmed the US's commitment to Israel's defense by continuing to supply Iron Dome rocket interceptors and other defensive equipment. However, he made it clear that if Israeli forces were to enter Rafah, the US would withhold supplying weapons and artillery shells.Biden reiterated the conditional nature of US military support: ""I made it clear that if they go into Rafah — they haven’t gone in Rafah yet — if they go into Rafah, I’m not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities, that deal with that problem."" Biden's stance marks a significant policy shift, emphasizing a strategic withdrawal from supporting offensive operations in such densely populated areas, saying, ""We’re not walking away from Israel’s security.We’re walking away from Israel’s ability to wage war in those areas.""Here is all you need to know about why the US is stopping some bomb shipments to IsraelThe US has paused a shipment that includes 1,800 2,000-pound bombs and 1,700 500-pound bombs. These are significant because their use in densely populated areas like Rafah can lead to high civilian casualties. President Biden expressed this concern clearly: “Civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs and other ways in which they go after population centers.""The decision comes amidst escalating violence in Gaza, particularly in Rafah, where the potential for civilian casualties is substantial due to the dense population. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin stated, ""We've been very clear...from the very beginning that Israel shouldn't launch a major attack into Rafah without accounting for and protecting the civilians that are in that battlespace."" The concern is that the large bombs could cause excessive damage and civilian deaths in such settings.Israel's US ambassador, Gilad Erdan, described the US decision to pause the bomb shipment as ""very disappointing,"" even frustrating, suggesting it might be a result of political pressure on Biden. Despite this, Erdan expressed confidence that the US would not completely stop supplying arms to Israel.Yes, there have been instances in the past where the US has withheld military aid from Israel. For example, in 1982, President Ronald Reagan imposed a six-year ban on cluster weapons sales to Israel following reports that they were used in populated areas during the 1982 invasion of Lebanon. Such decisions are often influenced by concerns over the use of US supplied weapons in conflict zones and their impact on civilian populations.(With inputs from agencies)","US President Joe Biden has warned that the US would not provide offensive weapons to Israel for a potential full-scale assault on Rafah, a critical Hamas stronghold in Gaza.

New Russian space weapon raises alarm in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-russian-space-weapon-raises-alarm-in-us/articleshow/109919862.cms,"NEW DELHI: US officials have expressed grave concerns about Russia 's development of a new nuclear anti-satellite (ASAT) weapon, which could potentially transform Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) into a perilous battleground. The discussions about this emerging threat were highlighted by Mallory Stewart, the US assistant secretary of state for arms control, and John Plumb, the assistant secretary of defense for space policy, underscoring the serious implications of such developments.The ASAT weapon in question, allegedly already tested by Russia in high radiation orbits under the guise of electronic testing, diverges from typical scientific satellite protocols. This weapon is designed to disrupt a wide array of satellite operations spanning civilian, commercial, and military sectors by detonating in LEO, which extends approximately 100 to 1200 miles above the Earth, a report in Asia Times said.While there is no immediate deployment, the indiscriminate nature of such a weapon could severely damage satellites and impair critical global services including communication, weather forecasting, and security operations. The US officials emphasized the widespread implications of deploying such technology, noting its potential to make LEO unusable for any satellite operations.The concept of using nuclear weapons in ASAT roles isn't new and harks back to Cold War anxieties. Historical precedents like the US's Project 437 during the Kennedy administration, which was later abandoned due to its potential to damage both enemy and US satellites and infrastructure indiscriminately, illustrate the complexities and risks associated with such weapons.Recent simulations, such as those conducted by Chinese military scientists, have explored the effects of a nuclear detonation at altitude on satellite functionality. These studies show that while a high-altitude nuclear explosion would not create a traditional explosive cloud due to the absence of air, it would generate a belt of high-energy particles trapped by Earth’s magnetic field, posing a significant risk to spacecraft.In response to the decisive role satellite constellations like Elon Musk’s Starlink have played in modern warfare, evidenced by their utility in the ongoing Ukraine conflict, both Russia and China have hinted at developing ASAT capabilities to counter these systems. Reports suggest that these nations view the neutralization of such satellite networks as crucial to diminishing their adversaries' operational effectiveness.US and allied commercial satellites, including those like Starlink which have been pivotal in supporting Ukraine, have been identified by Russian officials as potential targets in the event of escalating hostilities. This stance highlights the broader strategy of using space capabilities as a means of asserting dominance and the potential shift towards militarization of space, despite international treaties like the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which seeks to bar such activities.The development and potential deployment of nuclear ASAT weapons pose not only a technological or tactical challenge but also a diplomatic and strategic one, threatening the fabric of international space law and the peaceful use of outer space.",US officials have expressed grave concerns about Russia's development of a new nuclear anti-satellite weapon.

Biden, in an interview with CNN on Wednesday, said that the US was still committed to Israel's defence and would supply Iron Dome rocket interceptors and other defensive arms but that if Israel goes into Rafah, ""we're not going to supply the weapons and artillery shells used.""Biden acknowledged that ""civilians have been killed in Gaza"" by the type of heavy bombs that the US has been supplying - his first validation of what administration critics have been loudly protesting, even if he still stopped short of taking responsibility.His threat to hold up artillery shells expanded on earlier revelations that the US was going to pause a shipment of heavy bombs.The US has historically provided enormous amounts of military aid to Israel. That has only accelerated in the aftermath of Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, which killed some 1,200 people in Israel and led to about 250 being taken captive by militants.Biden's comments and his decision last week to pause the shipment of heavy bombs to Israel are the most striking manifestations of the growing daylight between his administration and Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu's govt. Biden said Wednesday that Israel's actions around Rafah had ""not yet"" crossed his red lines, but has repeated that Israel needs to do far more to protect the lives of civilians in Gaza.The shipment was supposed to consist of 1,800 2,000-pound (900-kg) bombs and 1,700 500-pound (225-kg) bombs, according to a senior US administration official. The focus of US concern was the larger explosives and how they could be used in a dense urban area.""Civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs and other ways in which they go after population centers,"" Biden told CNN.

At first, under both Truman and President Dwight Eisenhower, the US refused to sell Israel weapons at all.President John F Kennedy became the first to open up the arsenal by providing Hawk antiaircraft missiles. President Lyndon B. Johnson expanded ties by sending M-48 tanks, A-4 Skyhawk planes and F-4 Phantom planes. Presidents have held back aid to Israel before to indicate displeasure or influence policy. President Ronald Reagan more than once delayed shipments of warplanes and other munitions out of dissatisfaction with Israeli intervention in Lebanon. President George H.W. Bush postponed $10 billion in housing loan guarantees to keep American money from being used to finance settlement construction in the West Bank.Overall, since World War II, the US has given more aid to Israel than any other country in the world.

US says Rafah offensive would jeopardize cease-fire talks as Biden threatens to halt more Israel aid,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-says-rafah-offensive-would-jeopardize-cease-fire-talks-as-biden-threatens-to-halt-more-israel-aid/articleshow/109989054.cms,"WASHINGTON: The United States warned on Thursday that Israel will be dealing a strategic victory to Hamas if it carries out plans for an all-out assault on Rafah , the militants' last major stronghold in Gaza.The warning was backed by a new threat from President Joe Biden : He says he will pause more offensive military assistance to Israel if it goes through with the operation in a city where more than 1 million civilians are sheltering.Biden last week put on hold a shipment of large bombs to Israel over concerns the weapons are of the type that has caused significant civilian casualties in Gaza and would almost certainly do more such damage if Israel conducted a major offensive in Rafah.On Wednesday, he held out the possibility of holding up future shipments of bomb guidance kits and artillery to Israel, in hopes the threat would turn Israel back from an operation in the city.The pronouncements are part of last-ditch push for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his far-right government to rethink their public commitments to invade the city in an effort to eradicate Hamas. The U.S. believes such a move would result in significant civilian casualties and exacerbate an already dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza.The U.S. is making its sharpest moves yet to influence the decision-making of its ally in the ongoing war against the militant group that was triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel. Some 1,200 people in Israel were killed and about 250 were taken captive.“Our view is any kind of major Rafah ground operation would actually strengthen Hamas' hands at the negotiating table, not Israel’s,” White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Thursday. He said more civilian deaths in Rafah from an Israeli offensive would give more ammunition to Hamas' “twisted narrative” about Israel.Talks in Cairo aimed at securing a six-week cease-fire to allow for the release of some hostages and a surge of food and aid to civilians in Gaza are continuing, Kirby added. But CIA Director Bill Burns and other delegations to the talks left Egypt on Thursday without a deal.Kirby said it was too soon to know whether the aid holdup had altered the Israeli calculus, but that the U.S. was continuing to advise Israel on how it could defeat Hamas through more surgical operations.“We believe that they have put an enormous amount of pressure on Hamas and that there are better ways to go after what is left of Hamas in Rafah than a major ground operation,"" he added.Biden, in an interview with CNN on Wednesday, insisted that despite the arms hold up, the U.S. was still committed to Israel's defense and would supply Iron Dome rocket interceptors and other defensive arms .He acknowledged that “civilians have been killed in Gaza” by the type of heavy bombs that the U.S. has been supplying. It was his first validation of what administration critics have been loudly protesting, even if he still stopped short of taking responsibility. His threat to hold up artillery shells expanded on earlier revelations that the U.S. was going to pause a shipment of heavy bombs.Biden said Israel’s actions around Rafah had “not yet” crossed his red lines, but he has repeated that Israel needs to do far more to protect the lives of civilians in Gaza. The Hamas-run health ministry puts the toll at more 34,000 dead, though it doesn’t distinguish between militants and civilians.Israel's military spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said that despite the American pause, “we have what we need” to press ahead with the mission. His comments came after Netanayahu brushed Biden's threat, saying in a statement, ""If we have to stand alone, we will stand alone.”The U.S. has historically provided enormous amounts of military aid to Israel. The shipment that was paused was supposed to consist of 1,800 2,000-pound (900-kilogram) bombs and 1,700 500-pound (225-kilogram) bombs, according to a senior U.S. administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter. The focus of U.S. concern was the larger explosives and how they could be used in a dense urban area.“I made it clear that if they go into Rafah — they haven’t gone in Rafah yet — if they go into Rafah, I’m not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities, that deal with that problem,"" Biden said.“We’re not walking away from Israel’s security,"" the Democratic president continued. “We’re walking away from Israel’s ability to wage war in those areas.”U.S. officials had declined for days to comment on the halted transfer. Word about it came as Biden on Tuesday described U.S. support for Israel as “ironclad, even when we disagree.”Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, Gilad Erdan, in an interview with Israeli Channel 12 TV news, said the decision to pause the shipment was “a very disappointing decision, even frustrating."" He suggested the move stemmed from political pressure on Biden from Congress, the U.S. campus protests and the upcoming election.The decision also drew a sharp rebuke from House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who said they only learned about the holdup from press reports, despite assurances from the Biden administration that no such pauses were in the works. The Republicans called on Biden in a letter to swiftly end the blockage, saying it “risks emboldening Israel's enemies,” and to brief lawmakers on the nature of the policy reviews.Biden has faced pressure from some on the left and condemnation from the critics on the right who say Biden has moderated his support for an essential Mideast ally.“The American people support Israel overwhelmingly,” said South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 Republican, who pushed a resolution condemning Biden’s decision. “And they also believe that Israel needs to do what is necessary, and if that includes going into Rafah to root out the Hamas threat, then that is necessary for their very survival.”Former President Donald Trump, entering a New York courthouse for his criminal trial over hush money payments, criticized Biden as well, saying Thursday that “What Biden is doing with respect to Israel is disgraceful.” The presumptive GOP presidential nominee added, “If any Jewish person voted for Joe Biden, they should be ashamed of themselves. He’s totally abandoned Israel.”Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a Biden ally, said in a statement the pause on big bombs must be a “first step.”“Our leverage is clear,” Sanders said. “Over the years, the United States has provided tens of billions of dollars in military aid to Israel. We can no longer be complicit in Netanyahu’s horrific war against the Palestinian people.”Israeli troops on Tuesday seized control of Gaza’s vital Rafah border crossing in what the White House described as a limited operation that stopped short of the full-on Israeli invasion of the city that Biden has repeatedly warned against.Israel has ordered the evacuation of 100,000 Palestinians from the city. Israeli forces have also carried out what it describes as “targeted strikes” on the eastern part of Rafah and captured the Rafah crossing, a critical conduit for the flow of humanitarian aid along the Gaza-Egypt border.The State Department is separately considering whether to approve the continued transfer of Joint Direct Attack Munition kits, which place precision guidance systems onto bombs, to Israel, but the review didn’t pertain to imminent shipments.","Biden last week put on hold a shipment of large bombs to Israel over concerns the weapons are of the type that has caused significant civilian casualties in Gaza.

The HRCP demanded economic justice and protection of civil rights and stressed the importance of upholding democratic principles and the rule of law.In its annual report, 'State of Human Rights 2023', released on Wednesday, the HRCP noted with concern that irreparable political divisions led to public acts of arson and violence on May 9, 2023, after the arrest of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan.""What followed was flagrant disregard for the Constitution as unelected forces tightened their grip on the country's democratic structures and civic spaces shrank to an all-time low,"" the report read, according to Dawn.According to the report, the state's response to the May 9 riots was to quell dissent by resurrecting military courts to try civilians, perpetrating enforced disappearances, ordering mass arrests and allegedly orchestrating public disassociation from the PTI among many senior party leaders.The report noted that the right to freedom of expression and assembly took a particular hit during the year. According to the report, the rule of law was poor, with six-year high in fatalities related to terrorist attacks and counter-terrorism operations. The report noted that the practice of extrajudicial killings continued while street crime and the incidence of mob lynchings witnessed a rise.According to the report, journalists, activists and political workers were subjected to enforced disappearances across the country, like what happened in previous years, Dawn reported. The report noted that young Baloch women held a long march from Turbat to Islamabad to protest against alleged extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances.The report said that religious minorities reported an increasing climate of fear, particularly following the attack in Jaranwala, in which scores of churches and homes were torched and looted by mobs after allegations of blasphemy against a Christian man.The report said that Afghan nationals were rounded up in police raids and sent to deportation centres. Speaking at the launch of the report, HRCP secretary-general Harris Khalique said the economic crisis in 2023 had 'pushed tens of millions of ordinary citizens to the brink of desperation.'Speaking on incidents of enforced disappearances, Harris Khalique condemned the role and performance of the Commission of Inquiry of Enforced Disappearances and termed it 'disgraceful,' Dawn reported.HRCP chairperson Asad Iqbal Butt called it critical for the state to fulfil people's rights to education, livelihood and health. He also expressed concern over the low rate of trade unionisation.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan on Tuesday said the attack on a Chinese engineers' convoy in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in March, which killed five Chinese nationals, was planned in Afghanistan .""The March suicide bombing connects to Afghanistan. The planning of this terror act was done in Afghanistan. Terrorists and their facilitators were also being controlled from Afghanistan and the suicide bomber was also an Afghan [national],"" said Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Maj-Gen Ahmed.Over the past few months, Pakistan has repeatedly criticised the Taliban regime in Kabul for helping terrorists carry out attacks targeting security personnel, and Chinese nationals working on projects linked to Beijing's crucial Belt and Road Initiative.Speaking at a press conference, military spokesperson Ahmed Sharif strongly condemned the acts of terrorism and assured that necessary actions were being taken to bring the facilitators to justice.Despite Pakistan's efforts for peace in the region and hosting Afghan refugees, TTP terrorists continue to launch attacks from Afghan soil, he said.The DG added that Pakistan had presented concrete evidence to the Afghan interim government, but no positive progress has been made.""There is concrete evidence that TTP terrorists are still using Afghan soil to launch attacks in Pakistan ... In this regard, we have registered 12 protests and the army chief has taken a clear stance that Pakistan has its reservations on hideouts of banned outfits in Afghanistan,"" said Sharif.The DG ISPR emphasized that Pakistan will take all measures to eradicate terror networks and protect its citizens.""Pakistan will leave no stone unturned to eradicate terror networks and provide protection to its citizens at all costs ... the purpose of the armed forces is to establish peace in the country ... to ensure this, we will go to every extent to suppress the terrorists and their patrons and enablers,"" said Sharif.Pakistan recently carried out counter-attacks in Afghanistan's border areas, targeting terrorist safe havens.The DG ISPR mentioned that in 2024, security forces have conducted 13,135 operations against terrorists and their facilitators, resulting in the elimination of 249 terrorists and the arrest of 396 others.Pakistani forces are carrying out more than 100 operations daily against terrorism.","Pakistan says attack on Chinese engineers' convoy in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in March was planned in Afghanistan.

"Pakistan wheat scam probe: Evasive response of govt raises concerns, says report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-wheat-scam-probe-evasive-response-of-govt-raises-concerns-says-report/articleshow/109853452.cms,"LAHORE: The Pakistan government's response to the wheat scam investigation appears to be evasive, despite Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif 's assurance to safeguard farmers ' interests, Dawn reported.While he has pledged unwavering support for farmers, the federal government's reluctance to thoroughly probe the alleged scam and hold accountable those responsible is palpable.Heading the fact-finding committee tasked with unravelling irregularities in the wheat import is Cabinet Secretary Kamran Ali Afzal. However, there seems to be an element of hesitancy within the government to engage fully in the investigation, the report noted.A source within the PML-N revealed Nawaz Sharif 's insistence on robust action against the perpetrators, regardless of their political influence. However, there's a noticeable lack of enthusiasm from the current government to involve bodies such as the NAB or FIA in the investigation, despite suggestions, according to Dawn.Information Minister Attaullah Tarar's dismissal of engaging the NAB or FIA raises eyebrows, especially given the magnitude of the alleged scam, which surpasses PKR 500 million, warranting their involvement according to new laws. The government's cautious approach, attributed to the involvement of the former caretaker government, reflects a reluctance to tread on contentious ground.Reports suggesting substantial wheat imports under Shehbaz Sharif's administration post-elections have added another layer to the controversy, the report noted. Denials from government officials contradict the allegations, further complicating the situation. Blame for the wheat crisis is shifted to the caretaker government, distancing the current administration from any culpability.Adding to the confusion are reports of the summoning of former caretaker officials by the fact-finding committee, which were swiftly denied by its head, Kamran Ali Afzal.Tensions continue to escalate within the PML-N, with Hanif Abbasi confronting former caretaker premier Anwaarul Haq Kakar over the wheat scandal. Kakar's veiled threats hint at underlying political manoeuvring, adding intrigue to the unfolding drama. The PTI seized the opportunity to push for a judicial commission, capitalising on the discord within the opposition camp.Amidst the chaos, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif strived to reassure farmers of his unwavering support.His formation of a committee to address farmers' grievances demonstrates a proactive stance, aiming to alleviate concerns regarding wheat procurement, Dawn reported.","The Pakistan government's response to the wheat scam investigation appears to be evasive.

Civilian casualties rise in Myanmar's civil war as resistance forces tighten noose around military,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/civilian-casualties-rise-in-myanmars-civil-war-as-resistance-forces-tighten-noose-around-military/articleshow/109975142.cms,"BANGKOK : Six months into an offensive against Myanmar 's military government, opposition forces have made massive gains, but civilian casualties are rising sharply as regime troops increasingly turn toward scorched-earth tactics in the Southeast Asian country's bitter civil war.There is pressure on all fronts from powerful militias drawn from Myanmar's ethnic minority groups and newer resistance forces .Troops are retaliating with air, naval and artillery strikes on hospitals and other facilities where the opposition could be sheltered or aided.""When the mass of people rise up against them, I think it terrifies them,"" said Dave Eubank, a former US Special Forces soldier who founded the Free Burma Rangers, a humanitarian aid organization that has provided assistance to both combatants and civilians in Myanmar since the 1990s.""They know that hospitals, churches, schools and monasteries are important places for human care, and gathering, and symbols - and they hammer them,"" said Eubank. ""That's new.""Military forces now control less than half the country, but are holding on tenaciously to much of central Myanmar including the capital, Naypyidaw - recently targeted by drone attacks - and largest city, Yangon, and is far better armed than the resistance forces, with support from Russia and China.""People have been saying that the regime was on the brink of collapse since two weeks after the coup,"" in February 2021, said Morgan Michaels, an analyst with the International Institute of Strategic Studies who runs its Myanmar Conflict Map project.""On the other hand, obviously the regime is weaker than it's ever been.... so there's no doubt that it's in serious, serious trouble,"" he said.Thet Swe, a spokesman for the military government, denied that troops were targeting buildings and areas where civilians were sheltering, blaming their destruction instead on the opposition forces, without citing evidence.""The military never harmed hospitals, churches and civilians in our country,"" he told The Associated Press in an email. ""They did not use that strategy and are fighting the rebels only for the sovereignty of our country.""As the fighting has moved into more populated areas, about 1 million people have been forced to flee their homes since the start of the offensive in October, contributing to the more than 3 million internally displaced people in the country of some 56 million, according to the UN's humanitarian aid agency.With the collapse of its health care system and food supplies dwindling, 18.6 million people are in need, up 1 million from a year ago, including 6 million children, the agency said.HOW IT BEGAN Opposition in Myanmar, also known as Burma, had been growing since the army seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021, but it gained new momentum in October when major militias known collectively as the Three Brotherhood Alliance launched a joint offensive.Together, the Arakan Army, the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army and the Ta'ang National Liberation Army - among the most powerful militias formed by Myanmar's ethnic minorities - made quick advances.As they captured huge swaths of territory largely in the north and northeast, including economically important border crossings with China and several major military bases, other ethnic armed groups sensed momentum and joined the fighting.At the same time, People's Defense Forces - armed resistance groups that support the shadow National Unity Government, which views itself as Myanmar's legitimate administration - have been increasing in number and launching their own attacks, often supported and trained by the ethnic armed militias.Both sides claim they have inflicted heavy tolls. And the military government under Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing has acknowledged it is under pressure, recently reintroducing conscription to increase its ranks.That has pushed some young people into the resistance. Many more have fled to rural areas or neighboring countries to avoid fighting.With the violence across its border, China helped broker a cease-fire in Myanmar's north in January with the Three Brotherhood Alliance. But the alliance's Arakan Army continues to fight in its home Rakhine state in the west and has made significant gains, while PDFs and other ethnic armed groups continue their own attacks elsewhere.THE LATEST FIGHTING The fiercest fighting in recent weeks has been in the southeast, where the main ethnic Karen fighting force, the Karen National Liberation Army, claimed in early April to have seized all the military bases in Myawaddy, the main town on the border with Thailand in Kayin state, also known as Karen state.One army battalion clung to a position beside one of Myawaddy's two bridges, assisted by the Border Guard Force, a rival Karen group that had been in charge of border area security for years, conducting lucrative business by providing protection to area casino resorts with links to organized crime.The force, which declared itself neutral in January, now controls the town with military government administrators still in place, highlighting how some militia groups still prioritize their own interests.""This is not a black and white situation. This is not the regime reconquering and reconsolidating control,"" Michaels said of the fighting in the area. ""This is the regime hanging on, keeping a foothold by the razor's edge.""Meanwhile, the military has pushed KNLA and People's Defense Forces out of Kawkareik, a strategically important town along the road that connects Myawaddy with the rest of the country.Thousands of civilians have fled Myawaddy and Kawkareik. But many civilians haven't managed to escape.At least 1,015 civilian deaths have been documented from Nov 1 through May 1, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a watchdog group that tracks political arrests, attacks and casualties. It says 4,962 civilians have been killed overall since the military took power three years ago.The watchdog blamed the deaths on the military's increasing use of scorched-earth tactics and fighting moving into more populated areas.""The military has increasingly lost areas of control in recent months, which has only increased their use of this strategy, responding with airstrikes, shelling and so on in civilian areas,"" the AAPP said in an email.The group added that the number of civilian deaths in the recent months of fighting is likely double what it reported, if not more, but that it can't document the numbers due to the intensification of the conflict.Kyaw Zaw, a spokesperson for the shadow National Unity Government, said the military had destroyed 343 hospitals and clinics since it took power, and that those attacks had accelerated in the last two months, though he didn't have specific details.Eubank, with the Free Burma Rangers, said he and his teams operating near the front lines have witnessed the military, known as the Tatmadaw, fighting with a "" speed and force and a viciousness that we've never seen.""But in fighting a common enemy, the resistance is showing growing unity, he said.""The Burma army is still stronger than any of these resistance groups, and if they want to bring a division or two to bear, they will win the battle, but they're not stronger than everybody else together,"" he said.WHAT COMES NEXT Whether that unity will continue if the regime falls, and if the disparate resistance forces can agree on a common path ahead for Myanmar, is an open question, Michaels said.""On one hand, Myanmar is not Syria - there is common cause in fighting the regime,"" Michaels said. ""But at the same time, as the regime has receded from some areas, there are at least indicators of potential future conflicts between groups.""He noted an incident in northern Shan state last month in which troops from two members of the Three Brotherhood Alliance - the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army and the Ta'ang National Liberation Army - traded fire over a territorial dispute. One person was injured.The groups quickly agreed to stand down, but the incident illustrates that territorial tension is real, Michaels said.An opposition politician still inside the country, speaking on condition of anonymity for his own safety, said Myanmar's people have a common desire for peace and stability, but the various factions still pursue their own interests.""It is hard to predict what is ahead, and they still don't have a single political direction or goal. I think there is quite a problem in this situation,"" he said.""Myanmar is now at a crossroads.""","Six months into an offensive against Myanmar's military government, opposition forces have made massive gains. Military forces now control less than half the country, but are holding on tenaciously to much of central Myanmar. About 1 million people have been forced to flee their homes since the start of the offensive in October.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109975896,imgsize-1290399,width-400,resizemode-4/109975896.jpg"
US and Philippine forces sink a ship during largescale drills in the disputed South China Sea,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/us-and-philippine-forces-sink-a-ship-during-largescale-drills-in-the-disputed-south-china-sea/articleshow/109972767.cms,"LAOAG: US and Philippine forces, backed by an Australian air force surveillance aircraft, unleashed a barrage of high-precision rockets, artillery fire and airstrikes Wednesday and sank a mock enemy ship as part of largescale war drills in and near the disputed South China Sea that have antagonized Beijing.Military officials and diplomats from several countries watched the display of firepower from a hilltop along a sandy coast in Laoag City in Ilocos Norte, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr's northern home province.More than 16,000 military personnel from the United States and the Philippines , along with a few hundred Australian troops and military observers from 14 countries, were participating in annual combat-readiness drills called Balikatan, Tagalog for shoulder-to-shoulder. The drills, which started April 22 and end Friday, include a scenario of a foreign invasion of the Philippine archipelago.It's the latest indication of how the United States and the Philippines have bolstered a defense treaty alliance that started in the 1950s amid their concern in recent years over China's increasingly aggressive actions in disputed territories in Asia.Marcos has ordered his military to shift its focus to external defense from decades-long domestic anti-insurgency operations as China's actions in the South China Sea become a top concern. That strategic shift dovetails with the efforts of U.S. President Joe Biden and his administration to reinforce an arc of alliances in the Indo-Pacific region to counter China.China has angered the Philippines by repeatedly harassing its navy and coast guard ships with powerful water cannons, a military-grade laser, blocking movements and other dangerous maneuvers in the high seas near two disputed South China Sea shoals. They have led to minor collision that have injured several Filipino navy personnel and damaged supply boats.""We're under the gun,"" Philippine Ambassador to Washington Jose Romualdez told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.""We don't have the wherewithal to be able to fight all of this bullying coming from China so where else will we go?"" Romualdez said. ""We went to the right party, which is the United States and those that believe in what the US is doing.""China has accused the Philippines of setting off the hostilities in the disputed waters by encroaching in what it says are its offshore territories, demarcated by 10 dashes on a map. It says the Chinese coast guard and navy have been forced to take action to expel Philippine coast guard and other vessels from those areas. The Philippines has repeatedly cited a 2016 international arbitration ruling based on the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea that invalidated China's claim over virtually the entire South China Sea on historical grounds.China did not participate in the arbitration complaint filed by the Philippines in 2013, and has rejected the ruling and continues to defy it.After being hit repeatedly by missile and artillery fire and bombs dropped by U.S. and Philippine warplanes during the combat drills, the mock enemy ship sank as black smoke billowed from its stern. The target ship was made in China but decommissioned by the Philippine navy in 2020 due to mechanical and electrical issues, according to the Philippine military.Philippine military officials said the drills were not directed at any country. China has opposed military drills involving U.S. forces as well as increasing U.S. military deployments in the region, which it warned would escalate tensions and endanger regional stability.For the first time in years, the combat exercises were staged in and near the fiercely contested Spratly Islands area, which China has closely guarded with its coast guard, navy and suspected militia flotillas.On Monday, US and Filipino marines transported by Black Hawk helicopters practiced securing an airfield in the country's northernmost town of Itbayat along the Bashi Channel near southern Taiwan. A small group of journalists, including from the AP, was invited to witness the air and ground combat maneuvers.""They're not operating in safe areas. They're operating slightly further to the western bounds and they're doing that in order to practice in ways that they might have to work for real,"" said British Defense Attache to Manila Bea Walcot, who watched the ship-sinking drill.Washington and Beijing have been on a collision course over China's increasingly assertive actions to defend its territorial claims in the South China Sea, and Beijing's stated goal of annexing Taiwan, by force if necessary.In February last year, Marcos approved a wider US military presence in the Philippines by allowing rotating groups of American military forces to stay in four more Philippine military camps. That was a sharp turnaround from his predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, who feared that a larger American military footprint would antagonize Beijing.China strongly opposed the move, which allows US forces to establish staging grounds and surveillance posts in the northern Philippines across the channel from Taiwan, and in western Philippine provinces facing the South China Sea.China has warned that the deepening security alliance between Washington and Manila and their ongoing military drills should not harm its security and territorial interests or interfere in the territorial disputes. The Philippines countered that it has the right to defend its sovereignty and territorial interests.""An alliance is very important to show China that you may have all the ships that you have, but we have a lot of firepower to sink all of them,"" Romualdez said.","More than 16,000 military personnel from the United States and the Philippines are participating in annual combat-readiness drills. The drills, which started April 22 and end Friday, include a scenario of a foreign invasion of the Philippine archipelago. China has opposed military drills involving U.S. forces as well as increasing American military deployments in the region.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109972533,imgsize-850000,width-400,resizemode-4/109972533.jpg"
"Rape, terror and death at sea: How a boat carrying Rohingya children, women and men capsized",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/rape-terror-and-death-at-sea-how-a-boat-carrying-rohingya-children-women-and-men-capsized/articleshow/109951864.cms,"MEULABOH: Huddled on board the boat, the 12-year-old girl quaked with fear.The captain and crew who she says had tortured her and three other women and girls were not finished. And the punishment for disobedience, the men warned, would be death.It was the third night that the girl and around 140 other ethnic Rohingya refugees had been trapped on the fishing boat off Indonesia 's coast.They had fled Bangladesh and their homeland of Myanmar in a bid to escape violence and terror , only to face the same at sea.The 12-year-old - identified in this story only by the initial N, because she is a sexual assault survivor - tried to hide. She had already survived a night in the captain's bedroom, where she says he and several crew members had beaten and sexually abused her.Like most of the passengers, she had survived attacks by Myanmar's military that forced her and her family to flee to neighboring Bangladesh. There, she had survived nearly seven years in violence-plagued refugee camps. And she had thus far survived this journey without her family, who hoped she'd make it to Malaysia , where she was promised as a child bride to a man she had never met.The captain ordered more girls to join him and his crew in the bedroom.""If you don't come to us,"" he shouted, ""then we will capsize this boat!""What happened next would force N and the other Rohingya on board into yet another battle for survival.For many, this would be the battle they finally lost.In March, Indonesian officials and local fishermen rescued 75 people from the overturned hull of a boat off the coast of Indonesia's province of Aceh. Another 67 passengers, including at least 28 children, were killed when the boat capsized, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.Until now, little was known about why the boat capsized. This account, as told to The Associated Press in interviews with eight surviving passengers, provides the first insight into what happened.N's journey began in Bangladesh, where a series of boats ferried her and other Rohingya across the Bay of Bengal.The bedlam began, the passengers say, when they were transferred to a cramped Indonesian vessel that was supposed to take them to Indonesia. From there, they would be smuggled into Malaysia.The Indonesian captain and crew separated the men from the women and forced the men into the boat's cargo holds. Anyone who protested was beaten, says Muhammed Amin.The captain and crew - who warned they were armed, though no one saw a gun - forced N and four other women and girls into the captain's bedroom.One of the women slipped out, but N and the others were trapped. The assaults by the captain and five of his six crew lasted all night, N says.When morning dawned, N was allowed out to use the toilet. She hid among the other women, but the other three girls were abused for a second night.On the third night, the three girls emerged from the captain's room, sobbing and speechless.The captain and crew demanded fresh victims. The women refused.The captain and crew had been drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana, the passengers say. The furious captain threatened to capsize the boat unless the women complied.Soon after, Jannat Ullah says, he saw the captain push the steering wheel with his leg.The vessel tilted violently, sending passengers tumbling. And then it smashed into a wave.In the blackness of the water, people screamed for salvation, for God, for their children.N battled her way onto the boat's overturned hull. Once again, she had managed to survive. But the three girls who were abused alongside her had not.Amin spotted the captain and three crew members swimming away.In the morning, a small fishing boat arrived, and took six people to shore.Meanwhile, worsening waves had destabilized the capsized boat, which overturned again, killing more people.Rain spared passengers death by dehydration. But as another night passed, it was clear not everyone would survive. Rahena Begum's 9-year-old daughter stopped breathing.The passengers prayed, then slid the child's body into the sea.Around 30 minutes later, Rahena says, the rescue ship finally arrived.The bodies of 12 women and three children have since been recovered off Aceh, according to the UNHCR.Although the fishing boat's crew rescued the initial six people the morning of March 20, search vessels weren't launched until that evening. Officials didn't finish rescuing the passengers until midday on March 21.Ibnu Harris Al Hussain, chief of Banda Aceh's search and rescue agency, said the rescue operation began shortly after his agency learned about the boat.""The most important thing is that we have ensured their safety when they were found,"" Hussain wrote in a message to the AP.On April 2, police announced they had arrested three crew members, plus a fourth man who was not on the boat. They were charged with people smuggling, which carries a maximum 15-year prison sentence. Police are searching for the remaining crew, including the captain, who fled to Malaysia, West Aceh Police Chief Andi Kirana told the AP.Police are not considering murder charges, Kirana says, because they believe the capsize was an accident.But N and the other passengers believe the disaster was a deliberate act of revenge by a sadistic captain and crew. And for that, N says, the punishment should fit the crime.""They tortured us. They treated us like animals,"" she says. ""We want the government to treat them like animals.""Kirana also said police are not considering rape charges, because they haven't received reports of sexual assault. But N says police have never questioned her.N hopes to make it to Malaysia and to the man who wants her as his wife.Maybe then, she says, she will finally be free - though in reality, Rohingya child brides in Malaysia often become prisoners to abusive husbands.For now, all she can do is fight to survive another day.""I don't want to suffer anymore,"" she says.___Gelineau reported from Sydney.","In March, Indonesian officials and local fishermen rescued 75 people from the overturned hull of a boat off the coast of Indonesia's province of Aceh.

The agency reported that over 100 houses suffered severe damage, and 42 were completely swept away.Additionally, four roads and one bridge were damaged in the disaster.The landslides occurred in Luwu regency, South Sulawesi, just after 1.00 am local time on Friday, as stated by Abdul Muhari, the spokesperson for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency (BNPB). ""A total of 14 residents died due to floods and landslides in Luwu regency, South Sulawesi province,"" he said.More than 100 people have been evacuated to mosques or the homes of their relatives, and the authorities are working to evacuate more than 1,300 affected families.In a separate incident in South Sulawesi province, at least one person died, and two others were injured in floods on Friday, according to another statement by Indonesia disater agency spokesperson Muhari.Indonesia frequently experiences landslides during the rainy season, and the situation is exacerbated in certain areas by deforestation. Prolonged heavy rainfall also leads to flooding in various parts of the archipelago nation.The country has been grappling with a series of extreme weather events during its rainy season, which experts attribute to the increasing likelihood of such occurrences due to climate change.In March, flash floods and landslides on Sumatra island claimed the lives of at least 30 people, with many still missing. In December, a landslide and flooding near Lake Toba on Sumatra destroyed a hotel and swept away dozens of houses, resulting in at least two fatalities.(With AFP inputs)","At least 14 people died due to landslides and flooding that occurred on Saturday in central Indonesia.

'Fuel for water': Heatwave piles misery on Myanmar displaced,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/fuel-for-water-heatwave-piles-misery-on-myanmar-displaced/articleshow/109805863.cms,"A swelling camp

'Borrowing water'

Zay Yar Tun fills his truck with water for delivery to refugees in the parched hills of war-ravaged eastern Myanmar, where a heatwave is adding to the misery of life in displacement camps.Under a roof of plastic sheets in one of the camps in Kayah state, Augusta waits for the 10 gallons that must cover her family's drinking, cooking and washing needs for the next three days.More than 123,000 people have been forced to flee their homes in Kayah by the conflict unleashed by the military's 2021 coup, according to the United Nations .Now, a heatwave that has sent the mercury in Myanmar to 48 degrees Celsius (118 Fahrenheit) in some places has added to uncertainties of life in the camps.""Last year, we got water from a spring nearby,"" Augusta told AFP.""But now we can't get water from that place as there is no water left there.""We have to be frugal... If we don't shower today, maybe tomorrow we can wash our hands and faces.""The scarcity means she and her children are often unable to wash properly or clean their clothes in the baking heat.""The children are itching and they seem dirty, and we also don't have clean clothes for them,"" she said.A dozen or so camp residents queue up at the truck for water rations that will have to last them three or four days.Children carry the containers home in baskets on their backs or via trolleys as hot wind whips up dust from the dirt road.""When there were only residents living in this place, there was enough water,"" said Zay Yar Tun, of the charity Clean Yangon.""But after the displaced people fled here, the population is too much for the amount of water we can get here.""Donations keep Zay Yar Tun's team and its two trucks running, and they make two deliveries to the camp each week.Finding the streams or springs to fill up their truck can be dangerous in Kayah, which has emerged as one of the hotspots of resistance to military rule.The military regularly calls in air and artillery strikes on its opponents and landmines are a constant danger.Transporting cargo to the camps is difficult too.The fuel the team needs to run their trucks and pumps is expensive because of military restrictions on importing fuel into Kayah, Zay Yar Tun said.""The price of fuel is very expensive, and it seems like we are exchanging fuel to get water,"" he said.Families like Augusta's are forced to make similar calculations as they try to get through the heat.""If we are going to take a bath in the creek, we have to go far away from the camp,"" she said.""It's not a walkable distance under this temperature.""""If we go by motorcycle, it's not worth it because of the cost of fuel. If we save money for fuel, we may as well use it to buy water.""Respite in the form of the rainy season may be some way off yet.Myanmar's weather office has forecast that the monsoon, which usually begins around May, is likely to arrive late this year, state media reported this week.Until then, water will be priceless in the camp, said Augusta.""Sometimes we say to each other: 'I haven't got any water left, have you got any? Please could you give me some?'"" she said.""Our life has come to this, where we have to borrow water.""","More than 123,000 people have been forced to flee their homes in Kayah state.

""Under Rishi Sunak, the Conservatives have become a byword for incompetence and division."" Elphicke is the second Conservative lawmaker to defect to Labour in two weeks after Dan Poulter quit in anger over the govt's handling of the National Health Service.The defection of Elphicke is particularly surprising as she was widely considered to be on the right of the Conservative Party and has been hugely critical of Labour in the past. But she has recently been increasingly disapproving of the govt's approach to migrant crossings.
