'Battleship Potemkin' and several other films land in troubled waters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/battleship-potemkin-and-several-other-films-land-in-troubled-waters/articleshow/126028211.cms,"Kerala Fest Claims Centre Refused Clearance; I&B Min Points To Norms

Thiruvananthapuram/New Delhi: The ongoing 30th International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK) plunged into a crisis following the Centre's refusal to grant censor exemption certificates to several films, including Soviet auteur Sergei Eisenstein's black and white classic, 'Battleship Potemkin', leading to cancellations, uncertainty in scheduling and sharp political and artistic reactions.'Battleship Potemkin' was first released on Dec 21, 1925 and will celebrate its 100th birth anniversary this weekend.However, the Centre on Tuesday rejected allegations of selective denial saying the decision was based purely on procedural grounds. Ministry sources said 178 films were granted exemption out of 187 applications received, adding that the organisers applied for exemption on Dec 3, whereas guidelines require applications to be submitted at least 15 days before the start of a festival.The 30th edition of IFFK began on Dec 12 and will continue till Dec 19.According to organisers, screening permission was denied to some films as they did not have the mandatory censor exemption certificate issued by the Union ministry of information and broadcasting. As a result, seven screenings scheduled over the past two days were cancelled. Organisers warned that the situation could worsen, with up to eight more screenings facing the risk of cancellation if clearances were not received in time.The delay or denial of these exemptions triggered the current impasse, leaving organisers legally barred from proceeding with the screenings, even for internationally acclaimed works.'Battleship Potemkin', 74 minutes long, invariably figures in every list of ""Greatest Films of All time"". The film dramatised the Potemkin crew's real-life mutiny against its officers in 1905 Czarist Russia. Over the decades, the film's 'Odessa Steps' sequence became part of every cinema syllabus for both cinematographers and editors.Apart from Eisenstein's film, several other high-profile movies were initially refused permission. Three films under the Palestine package, including 'Palestine 36', were also denied permission, raising concerns over selective clearances. 'Palestine 36', however, was screened during the opening ceremony as organisers said they had not received the list of restricted films at that time.The state govt said later that the Centre on Tuesday granted clearance to four more films: 'Beef', 'Once Upon A Time In Gaza', 'Eagles of the Republic' and 'Heart of the Wolf'.Veteran filmmaker Adoor Gopalakrishnan said denying films permission based on titles or perceived themes undermined artistic freedom and the very spirit of international film festivals.CPM general secretary M A Baby alleged that the Centre was deliberately attempting to sabotage the festival, accusing it of interfering in cultural spaces. Congress MP Shashi Tharoor intervened in the matter, seeking an early resolution to prevent further disruption to the festival.Meanwhile, Kerala's cultural affairs minister Saji Cherian directed the State Chalachitra Academy to ensure that none of the selected films were dropped and asserted that all films would be screened in accordance with the original schedule.",The 30th International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK) plunged into a crisis following the Centre's refusal to grant censor exemption certificates to several films.

Ex-Maharashtra CM Prithviraj Chavan's 'Op Sindoor' Remark Sparks Row, BJP Hits Back

.

NEW DELHI: A political storm erupted on Tuesday after former Maharashtra chief minister and senior Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan claimed that India was “completely defeated” on the first day of Operation Sindoor, while questioning the conduct of the military operation. His remarks triggered sharp criticism from the BJP Speaking to reporters in Pune, Chavan alleged that India suffered setbacks on the first day of the operation.“On the first day (of Operation Sindoor) we were completely defeated. In the half-hour aerial engagement that took place on the 7th, we were fully defeated, whether people accept it or not. Indian aircraft were shot down. The Air Force was completely grounded, and not a single aircraft flew. If any aircraft had taken off from Gwalior, Bathinda, or Sirsa, there was a high probability of being shot down by Pakistan , which is why the Air Force was fully grounded,” Chavan said.The Congress leader further alleged that Operation Sindoor, involved only aerial and missile warfare and saw no ground movement by the armed forces.“Recently, we saw during Operation Sindoor, there was not even a one-kilometre movement of the military... Whatever happened over two or three days was only an aerial war and missile warfare. In the future too, wars will be fought in the same way. In such a situation, do we really need to maintain an army of 12 lakh soldiers, or can we make they do some other work?” he said.Reacting strongly to Chavan’s remarks, BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla accused the Congress of repeatedly disrespecting the Indian Armed Forces and undermining national security operations.In a post on X, Poonawalla wrote that the statements made by the former Maharashtra chief minister were “shocking” and targeted the Air Force and the armed forces.He said, “Shocking Controversial statements by congress on Air Force and Armed Forces By Prithviraj Chavan. He says on the first day (of Operation Sindoor) we were completely defeated. In the half-hour aerial engagement that took place on the 7th, we were fully defeated, whether people accept it or not. Indian aircraft were shot down. In the future too, wars will be fought in the same way. In such a situation, do we really need to maintain an army of 12 lakh soldiers, or can we make they do some other work?”He further alleged that the Congress “hates Indian Armed Forces” and said “Sena ka apman is Congress ki pehchaan,” adding that the party has a history of questioning military actions, from “Sadak ka gunda to doubting Sindoor / Surgical Strike/ Balakote and even Op Mahadev.”Operation Sindoor was launched by India on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure deep inside Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). The operation was carried out in retaliation for the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, in which 26 civilians were killed.",Former Maharashtra chief minister Prithviraj Chavan claimed that India was “completely defeated” on the first day of Operation Sindoor.

Bangladesh Election Turmoil Deepens, Hasina's Awami League Rejects Poll Timeline Under Yunus Re

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Tuesday warned that India would not remain silent and teach a ""lesson"" if politicians in Bangladesh continued to make remarks about India's northeastern region.His comments came a day after Hasnat Abdullah, a senior leader of the newly formed National Citizen Party, said Dhaka should “isolate” India’s northeastern states and support separatist elements in the region if New Delhi attempted to “destabilise” the neighbouring country.""For the last one year, statements have been coming repeatedly from that country (Bangladesh) that the states of northeast India should be separated and made a part of Bangladesh.We are a very big country, a nuclear nation and the world’s fourth-largest economy. How can Bangladesh even think about it?"" Assam CM told reporters, according to PTI.""This mindset should not be encouraged, and Bangladesh should not be helped much in any way. We should teach them a lesson that if they continue to behave in this way. We will not remain silent,"" the BJP leader added.On Monday, Abdullah, a key leader of the student-led protests that brought down Bangladesh's Sheikh Hasina government in August last year, claimed that India’s north-eastern states were geographically ""vulnerable"" as they depend on the narrow Siliguri Corridor, also known as the ""Chicken’s Neck"", for connectivity with the rest of the country.Hasina has been living in Delhi since fleeing Dhaka, and ties between the two neighbours have been at an all-time low since her ouster. Last month, an International Crimes Tribunal found her guilty and sentenced her to death for ""crimes against humanity"" during the protests. Hasina rejected the verdict, describing it as ""politically motivated.""Dhaka has repeatedly sought the former prime minister’s extradition, a request New Delhi has said is “being examined.”Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, whose caretaker administration has been governing Bangladesh since the fall of Hasina’s government, has also repeatedly commented on India’s north-eastern region, commonly known as the ""Seven Sisters"" after the seven states that constitute it.","Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma warned that India would not remain silent and teach a ""lesson"" if politicians in Bangladesh continued to make remarks about India's northeastern region.

Arrested at Delhi airport after deportation



Charged with culpable homicide and negligence



What has happened so far?



Fled hours after fire



Detained in Thailand, shifted to immigration centre



Delhi court rejected anticipatory bail pleas



Extradition treaty enabled swift deportation



HC converts civil suit into PIL







Case registered under BNS



NEW DELHI: The owners of Goa’s Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub, Gaurav Luthra (44) and Saurabh Luthra (40), where a massive fire on December 6 claimed 25 lives, were taken into custody by the Goa Police on Tuesday.The Luthra brothers landed at Delhi’s IGI airport earlier in the day after being deported to India on “emergency certificates” following the extradition process.Investigators alleged that the two fled India within hours of the incident in an attempt to abscond after the tragedy.A Delhi court later granted a 48-hour transit remand to the Goa Police, following which the accused brothers were taken for medical examination as part of standard legal procedure.The Goa police formally arrested the Delhi-based brothers at the immigration control of Indira Gandhi International Airport on Tuesday after they landed in the national capital.They arrived on an IndiGo flight in the afternoon, wearing masks and surrounded by immigration security officials, and were immediately handed over to authorities for further legal proceedings.The Luthra brothers are facing charges of culpable homicide and negligence in connection with the December 6 blaze at their nightclub in Arpora, North Goa.Investigators alleged that the tragedy was compounded by serious violations of mandatory fire safety norms by the management, raising questions about regulatory lapses and accountability.According to investigators, Gaurav and Saurabh Luthra fled to Phuket in the early hours of December 7, just hours after the fire. Authorities subsequently cancelled their passports and issued an Interpol Blue Corner Notice to trace their movement.The duo was detained by Thai authorities on December 11 from Hotel Indigo Phuket’s Patong area following a request from the Union government. They were later shifted to an immigration detention centre in Bangkok as India coordinated with Thailand for their deportation under existing legal frameworks.On December 11, a Delhi court rejected the brothers’ transit anticipatory bail pleas. Additional sessions Judge Vandana termed the allegations “prima facie grave and serious” and sharply criticised the conduct of the accused.The court also noted that the brothers had booked tickets to Phuket just one hour after the fire, a fact their counsel had allegedly concealed while seeking protection from arrest.The judge observed that leaving the country immediately after the tragedy was a clear attempt to “evade the legal process”.An extradition treaty between India and Thailand has been in force since 2015. Thai officials said due process was followed as part of cooperation between the two countries, leading to the lawful and prompt deportation of the accused.Observing that “someone has to be held accountable” for the tragedy, a Goa bench of the Bombay high court on Monday converted a civil suit against the nightclub into a public interest litigation, underscoring the seriousness of the incident.The Goa Police registered a criminal case on December 7 at the Arpora Anjuna Police Station under Sections 105, 125, 125(a), 125(b) and 287, read with Section 3(5) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023.The fire broke out late on December 6 during a crowded event at the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub, killing 25 people, including five tourists and 20 staff members. A magisterial inquiry was ordered to determine the cause of the fire and fix responsibility for the lapses that led to the deadly incident.","Gaurav and Saurabh Luthra, owners of Goa's Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub, were taken into custody by the Goa Police on Tuesday.

‘Shameless’: Video of Nitish Kumar trying to remove doctor’s hijab sparks row; oppn slams Bihar CM,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shameless-video-of-nitish-kumar-trying-to-remove-doctors-hijab-sparks-row-oppn-slams-bihar-cm/articleshow/125995725.cms,"“I Supported You Twice, But Never Again” Nitish Kumar Hits Out At RJD

NEW DELHI: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Monday triggered a controversy after he pulled the hijab of a woman doctor during an appointment letter distribution programme.A video shared by the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) on X shows Nitish on stage alongside deputy chief minister Samrat Choudhary and health minister Mangal Pandey.The incident took place at a programme held at the chief minister’s residence, where appointment letters were being distributed to newly recruited AYUSH doctors.When it was the turn of Nusrat Parveen, who had arrived with her face covered with a hijab, Nitish frowned and exclaimed, “What is this?”Standing on a raised platform, Nitish then bent down and pulled the hijab down. The visibly flustered appointee was soon pulled aside by an official present at the event, while d CM Samrat Choudhary, standing beside Kumar, was seen tugging at his sleeve in an apparent attempt to restrain him.The incident drew sharp reactions from the opposition, with questions raised about Nitish Kumar’s conduct and mental health.Sharing the video on X, the RJD wrote, “What has happened to Nitish Ji? Has his mental state completely deteriorated, or has Nitish Babu now become a 100 per cent member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh?”Reacting to the incident, RJD MP Manoj Jha said the visuals were unsettling and raised serious concerns.“I have seen the visuals and they were unsettling. The Deputy CM even tried to stop him. It should be a matter of concern. As someone who has grown up in Bihar, I am worried that such visuals do not give a good message and raise several doubts,” Jha said.The Congress also attacked the Bihar chief minister, calling the act “vile.”“This is Bihar’s chief minister Nitish Kumar. Look at his shamelessness—a female doctor had come to collect her appointment letter, and Nitish Kumar pulled off her hijab. A man occupying the highest position in Bihar is openly indulging in such a vile act,” the party said in a post on X.“Nitish Kumar should immediately resign for this disgusting behaviour. This vileness is unforgivable,” it added.Congress MP Sukhdeo Bhagat also condemned the incident, accusing the chief minister of violating traditions and faith.“This does not seem appropriate from any angle. Treating a woman like this is condemnable,” Bhagat said.Shiv Sena MP Priyanka Chaturvedi also criticised the act, saying no one should be allowed to publicly humiliate an adult woman.“It is her dignity and knowledge of being an equal that makes her stand there to receive the acknowledgement she deserves. No father figure, CM, PM, brother or husband should be allowed to publicly humiliate an adult, educated woman for her choice of dress,” she wrote on X.According to the Chief Minister’s Office, the appointees included 685 Ayurveda doctors, 393 homeopaths and 205 practitioners of the Unani system of medicine.Of them, 10 appointees received their job letters in person from Kumar, while the rest were issued appointment letters online.","Bihar chief minister pulls hijab of woman doctor during appointment letter distribution programme.

Pune/Nashik: Conviction over securing a flat under a 10% EWS quota in 1995 by showing lower income has put a question mark over Manikrao Kokate's continuation as an MLA and as a Maharashtra cabinet minister.A Nashik sessions court upheld Tuesday a Feb 20 trial court judgment convicting and sentencing the sports minister and NCP functionary, along with his brother Vijay Kokate, to two years of rigorous imprisonment in the housing quota cheating case. The siblings had secured two flats. The court, however, set aside the trial court's direction to Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority and deputy collector to cancel the allotment of flats to the Kokate brothers and restore possession as earlier.Kokate represents Sinnar in rural Nashik. The ruling triggers the risk of ""immediate disqualification"" under the Representation of the People Act for sentences of two years or more, unless a higher court stays the conviction.Public prosecutor Sudhir Kotwal said the matter must now go to the high court. ""Under the law, Kokate's disqualification is certain unless he gets a suspension of his sentence and a stay on his conviction from the high court.Even with urgent circulation, this may take eight to 10 days. There is no bar on disqualification in the intervening period,"" Kotwal said.Assembly speaker Rahul Narwekar said he had not yet received the order. Supreme Court ruling from 2013 states disqualification is immediate, despite a three-month window to appeal. Relief comes only if conviction itself is stayed.Kokate's lawyer Avinash Bhide disagreed. ""We have a month's time to secure a stay and suspension from the high court. Even after that, the matter goes before the speaker,"" Bhide said.After the trial court ruling, Kokate had secured bail and on March 5, a sessions court stay on conviction and sentence during pendency of appeal. That protection has lapsed. ""Once a sessions court confirms conviction in appeal, it has no power to grant bail. The matter goes to the high court,"" Kotwal said.The prosecution said the brothers applied for flats under the EWS quota, declaring annual income of Rs 25,000 each, below the Rs 30,000 eligibility ceiling. ""Allotment relied on affidavits. When falsity emerged, onus lay on the deponents to prove otherwise,"" Kotwal said. Prosecutors said Kokate failed to disclose improved finances even by 1995, citing documents showing supplies of 70 tonnes, 80 tonnes and 120 tonnes of sugarcane in 1993, 1994 and 1995 to the Kopargaon cooperative sugar mill, yielding substantial earnings. ""This line weighed with the sessions court while affirming conviction and sentence,"" Kotwal said.Opposition parties accused BJP-headed govt of double standards, citing the swift disqualification of Congress MP Rahul Gandhi after his 2023 defamation conviction and contrasting it with the continued tenure of Kokate. ""Govt should immediately dismiss Kokate,"" Maharashtra Congress chief Harshvardhan Sapkal said. NCP state president Sunil Tatkare said the party would decide its next course of action after discussing the ruling with party chief and deputy CM Ajit Pawar.","Kokate represents Sinnar in rural Nashik.

The duo — Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra — was arrested by a team of Goa police at immigration.They will be flown to Goa on Wednesday morning after a Delhi court on Tuesday granted a two-day transit remand.“We have arrested Saurabh and Gaurav,” Goa director general of police (DGP) Alok Kumar told TOI.The brothers were sent back to India from Bangkok on an ‘emergency certificate’ on Tuesday morning as their Indian passports were suspended by the ministry of external affairs shortly after they flew to Thailand.Anjuna police will produce the Luthra brothers before a judicial magistrate first class (JMFC) at Mapusa on Wednesday to seek their custody for investigation.The duo had fled India on an IndiGo flight on Dec 7, hours after a deadly blaze led to the death of 25 people at their Arpora-based nightclub, Birch by Romeo Lane. They were staying at the Indigo hotel in Phuket and returned to India on an IndiGo flight as well.On Tuesday morning, the duo was spotted at the Bangkok airport wearing masks and surrounded by immigration security officials.They were allotted seats on either side at the very back of the aircraft with security personnel accompanying them. They were produced at the Patiala House Court in New Delhi at around 6.45pm where Goa police sought three days’ custody. The JMFC granted two days of transit remand. They were medically examined and taken back to the airport after that. The brothers folded hands and nodded when reporters asked them why they fled the country.“After taking custody of the deported Luthra brothers in New Delhi and on obtaining a transit remand, Goa police is bringing both the accused to the state. A police team is likely to land in Goa along with deported and arrested accused at around 11am on Wednesday,” Goa police’s public relation officer DySP Nilesh Rane said.Goa police had registered an FIR against them under various sections of the BNS, including culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Last week, a local court in Delhi had rejected the transit anticipatory bail of both the accused in connection with the case.Once a lookout notice was issued, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) decided to impound their passports, which meant that they were staying without valid travel documents in Thailand. India and Thailand signed a formal extradition treaty in 2013, which came into force on June 29, 2015.The duo was detained last week by Thai authorities for staying in that country illegally. A special team had subsequently gone to Phuket on Saturday to complete the deportation process. The brothers were then brought to the Bangkok detention centre. The Indian embassy in Thailand consequently issued an emergency certificate — a one-way travel document — to the Luthras since their passport was suspended by the Indian govt.So far, Goa police have arrested Gurgaon resident Ajay Gupta, 55, a partner of the Luthra brothers, New Delhi natives Rajiv Modak, 49, chief general manager, and Priyanshu Thakur, 32, gate manager, along with UP natives Rajveer Singhania, 32, bar manager, Vivek Singh, 27, general manager, and Bharat Kohli from Delhi.When the fire broke out at the nightclub at around 11.45pm on Dec 6, there were more than 150 tourists attending an event. A preliminary investigation by police and the directorate of fire services concluded that the fire broke out after electric firecrackers struck the wooden ceiling during the event.","The duo — Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra — was arrested by a team of Goa police at immigration.

'Paid Campaign': Nitin Gadkari Slams Criticism Of E20 Program; Calls It 'Politically Motivated'

New Delhi: Concerned about instances of poor quality and substandard work in several national highway (NH) projects, the office of road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari has sought details of all show-cause notices issued to contractors since Jan 2024, the responses received from companies and the action taken so far. Agencies have been directed to submit the details within 15 days.TOI has learnt that the minister’s office said that representations regarding poor-quality work had been submitted to officials concerned and that, in many cases, show-cause notices were issued. However, information on final action taken after replies were received has not been submitted in several instances.In a letter issued to the heads of highway agencies, it was stated that Gadkari has “expressed serious dissatisfaction” over the continuing deficiencies in construction quality and inadequate action against non-performing contractors.The minister has now sought comprehensive reports on notices issued to such defaulters, their responses — including corrective measures taken by them — and details of final action taken, such as imposition of monetary penalties and termination of contracts after scrutiny of replies.The minister’s office has also sought the current status of cases where responses are still under scrutiny, along with reasons for the pendency.The move gains significance in light of the rising instances of structural failures and damage to highway stretches, including on newly opened corridors, reported from different states.",Road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari has sought details of all show-cause notices issued to contractors since Jan 2024.

NEW DELHI: Opposition members in the Rajya Sabha on Monday pressed for reforms in the anti-defection law and electoral processes, arguing that defections, voter list issues and institutional weaknesses undermine the people’s mandate and raise questions over the “purity of elections”.While questioning the need for the special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls currently under way in 10 states and Union territories, the govt said the exercise was “constitutionally valid” and had been conducted several times in the past.Placing the debate in a broader ideological context, Congress leader Randeep Surjewala said electoral reforms strike at the heart of India’s freedom struggle and constitutional democracy, warning that any dilution of voting rights or institutional independence would hollow out the republic from within.“The core of Indian democracy lies in every individual’s right to vote and a government elected through those votes. If universal voting rights, free and fair elections by an independent Election Commission , and constitutional institutions are weakened, democracy becomes an illusion,” he said.Former Prime Minister H D Devegowda cautioned the Opposition against repeatedly alleging “vote chori”. “By using the words ‘vote chori’ you are going to suffer in the coming days.You are not going to win the battle,” he said, asserting that institutions such as the Election Commission and the Supreme Court were in place to address electoral issues and that people had confidence in the system.Senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh demanded that all slips generated from VVPAT machines be counted simultaneously to restore public trust in EVMs. On the proposed ‘One Nation, One Election’ framework, he termed it an “insult” to federalism and a step towards “fascist dictatorship”. Singh also alleged that Union home minister Amit Shah was never part of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, triggering sharp reactions from the treasury benches. Union minister Arjun Ram Meghwal accused Singh of “misinterpreting” Shah’s earlier statement in the Lok Sabha.Opposition members also cited the wide gap in funding available to political parties, stressing the need for a level-playing field in electoral processes. AAP MP Sandeep Kumar Pathak urged reforms in the funding of political parties.K R Suresh Reddy of the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) said defections had become routine, particularly in smaller states with narrow legislative margins. “Anti-defection is the name of the game today, especially in smaller states,” he said, noting that defecting legislators often fail to deliver on manifesto promises. He suggested setting up a parliamentary committee to make anti-defection provisions “watertight”.Echoing similar concerns, CPI(M) member John Brittas said the mandate must be respected even after elections. “When horse trading happens, when mass defections happen, when resorts become sanctum sanctorum, the purity of elections is in question,” he said, observing that while the law earlier curbed “retail defection”, “now wholesale defection is happening”.Responding to the Opposition, Law minister Arjun Ram Meghwal said SIR was constitutionally valid and had been undertaken several times earlier. He said the revision of electoral rolls was rooted in the constitutional framework laid down by B R Ambedkar, adding that even the Supreme Court had affirmed the Election Commission’s power to conduct SIR. Meghwal alleged that Congress had humiliated Ambedkar during his lifetime and public career.JD(U) member Sanjay Kumar Jha cited the February 2005 Bihar elections, claiming that despite Nitish Kumar having support, President’s rule was imposed after a midnight Cabinet meeting. “No MLA took oath… they are called ‘abhutpurv MLAs’,” he said.","Opposition members in the Rajya Sabha on Monday pressed for reforms in the anti- defection law and electoral processes.

India Slams Pakistan As ‘Global Epicentre Of Terror’, Vows To Counter Pak-Sponsored Attacks At UN

NEW DELHI: India on Monday firmly rejected Pakistan ’s reference to Jammu and Kashmir during an open debate at the United Nations Security Council , saying the Union territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh are an integral part of India and will always remain so.Speaking at the UNSC Open Debate on 'Leadership for Peace', India’s Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador Harish P, said Pakistan’s repeated mention of Jammu and Kashmir reflected an “obsessive focus” on harming India and its people.He said: ""I refer to the statement made by the representative of Pakistan today. India would like to reiterate that the Union Territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh are an integral and inalienable part of India.They were, are, and will always remain so. Pakistan’s unwarranted reference to Jammu & Kashmir in today’s open debate attests to its obsessive focus on harming India and its people. A serving non-permanent Security Council Member that chooses to further this obsession in all meetings and platforms of the UN in pursuit of its divisive agenda cannot be expected to fulfil its designated responsibilities and obligations.The Indian envoy said India signed the Indus Waters Treaty 65 years ago in good faith and with a spirit of friendship. However, he said Pakistan had violated the spirit of the treaty over the decades by waging three wars and sponsoring thousands of terror attacks against India. He added that tens of thousands of Indian lives have been lost in Pakistan-sponsored terrorism over the last four decades.Referring to the April 2025 Pahalgam terror attack, the ambassador said, ""The Pahalgam terror attack in April 2025, involved religion-based targeted killings of 26 innocent civilians by Pakistan-sponsored terrorists. It is in this backdrop that India has finally announced that the Treaty will be held in abeyance until Pakistan, which is a global epicentre of terror, credibly and irrevocably ends its support for cross-border and all other forms of terrorism. ""India criticised Pakistan's domestic political situation over jailing former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan and allowing its armed forces to engineer a ""constitutional coup"" through the new 27th amendment, which granted lifetime immunity to its chief of defence forces Asim Munir.""Pakistan, of course, has a unique way of respecting the will of its people - by jailing a Prime Minister, by banning the ruling political party and by letting its armed forces engineer a constitutional coup through the 27th amendment and giving lifetime immunity to its Chief of Defence Forces,"" Parvathaneni said.He further added that India would continue to counter Pakistan-sponsored terrorism in all its forms with full resolve.",India firmly rejected Pakistan’s reference to Jammu and Kashmir during an open debate at the United Nations Security Council.

LUDHIANA: Prisoners went on the rampage in Ludhiana Central Jail on Tuesday, attacking several officials, including jail superintendent Kulwant Singh Sidhu, who collapsed unconscious and was rushed to hospital. Jail DSP Jagjeet Singh and some CRPF personnel were also wounded.Ludhiana residents realised something was wrong when police vehicles from across the city, sirens blaring, started speeding towards Tajpur Road, where the jail is located.According to police, the violence began with a fistfight between inmates in the evening — two fighting against three. The alarm was raised and officials moved in to pacify both sides.The attempt to separate the five from the others somehow worsened the situation. An officer told TOI, ""The five started creating a ruckus. One of them alleged he was being targeted because of his religion. He gathered some supporters, so did the other side. Jail staff tried to stop the faceoff.""""When the jail superintendent arrived and tried to control the situation, the inmates started pelting bricks. One brick hit the superintendent on his head, following which he collapsed.Some other personnel were also injured in the brick-batting,"" added the officer.Asking how prisoners got hold of bricks, he said they picked them up from the garden bed in the open area of jail.With violence escalating, jail authorities switched on the siren and called police for immediate reinforcements. Within minutes, police forces, led by Ludhiana commissioner Swapan Sharma, and other senior officers rushed to the prison. Police helped the jail authorities push inmates back into their barracks.In June 2019, police had to fire over 150 gunshots to quell violence that broke out in the barracks.","Prisoners went on the rampage in Ludhiana Central Jail on Tuesday, attacking several officials, including jail superintendent Kulwant Singh Sidhu.

Delhi-Agra Expressway Crash: Multiple Buses Catch Fire, 4 Dead, 25 Injured

AGRA: The death toll in the devastating multi-vehicle collision on the Yamuna Expressway in Mathura has risen to 13, officials told news agency ANI on Tuesday, as rescue and relief operations continue.The tragic accident, which involved seven buses and three cars, left several victims charred to death after some of the buses caught fire. Among the deceased, one each was identified from Prayagraj, Gonda, and Azamgarh, while efforts are underway to identify the remaining victims.District authorities confirmed that all 60 injured passengers are receiving treatment in various hospitals, with doctors attending to burn injuries and trauma sustained in the crash.In the wake of the tragedy, Mathura District Magistrate Chandra Prakash Singh ordered a magisterial inquiry into the accident, with the Additional District Magistrate (Finance and Revenue) tasked to submit a report on the causes and recommend measures to prevent similar incidents in the future.Both the state and central governments have taken swift notice of the calamity.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath announced assistance of Rs 2 lakh for the families of each deceased, while Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his condolences via a tweet and announced an ex-gratia of Rs 2 lakh from the PMNRF for the next of kin of each deceased and Rs 50,000 for the injured.The PM said, “The loss of lives due to a mishap on the Yamuna Expressway in Mathura, Uttar Pradesh, is extremely painful. My thoughts are with those who have lost their loved ones. I pray for the speedy recovery of those injured.”Police have begun registering an FIR in connection with the accident, and authorities are examining CCTV footage and vehicle records to determine the cause. The horrific incident has sparked renewed concerns over road safety on high-speed expressways and the need for stricter traffic regulation and monitoring.The accident occurred around 4.30 am on the Agra–Noida stretch of the Yamuna Expressway, near Milestone 127, under the jurisdiction of Baldeo police station in Mathura district. Police said heavy fog and low visibility led to the pile-up involving multiple vehicles.Of the injured, all were rushed to nearby hospitals for primary treatment. Police said none of the injured is in critical condition.Speaking about the incident, SSP Mathura Shlok Kumar said the crash was triggered by poor visibility caused by dense fog. “Around 4.30 am, approximately seven buses and three small vehicles collided with each other due to low visibility. The vehicles caught fire after the collision. Local administration and emergency teams reached the spot immediately,” he said.He added that rescue operations are nearly complete. “So far, four deaths have been confirmed. Around 25 people have been admitted to hospital and none of them is serious. They are being provided the best possible treatment. The expressway was completely blocked, so traffic has been diverted from behind. The debris has now been removed and passengers have been sent to their destinations using government vehicles,” the SSP said.SP Mathura Rural Suresh Chandra Rawat said three cars first collided with each other, following which seven buses — including one roadways bus and six sleeper buses — rammed into them.“All the buses caught fire. Eleven fire tenders are at the spot and the fire has now been brought under control. Four dead bodies have been recovered so far. Rescue work is underway,” he said.The fatal crash on the Delhi–Agra Expressway comes a day after dense fog triggered multiple pile-ups across NCR expressways, leaving at least six people dead and several injured.The first major accident occurred near Raniyala Patakpur village in Nuh district, where at least 20 vehicles, including two trucks, were involved in a chain collision on the Delhi–Mumbai Expressway. Two people — CISF inspector Harish Kumar (38) from Alwar and Khalil (45) from Jaipur — were killed, while five others were injured.Another pile-up involving seven to eight vehicles was reported near Banarsi village on the same expressway, though no injuries were recorded. A separate accident on Delhi–Alwar Road near Ghaseda village involved a Haryana Roadways bus and a tractor, causing damage but no casualties.In Faridabad, a Ford Endeavour rammed into a stationary truck near Kail village on the Delhi–Mumbai Expressway, killing two men from Jaipur. A third occupant later succumbed to injuries during treatment.On the other side of NCR, two pile-ups involving around 20 vehicles were reported on the Eastern Peripheral Expressway near Attai village in Noida, leaving a 24-year-old truck driver dead and 13 others injured, police said.Traffic police across NCR said dense fog and near-zero visibility were the common factors in all the crashes and urged motorists to slow down, maintain lane discipline and avoid stopping on expressways during foggy conditions.","Death toll in multi-vehicle collision on Yamuna Expressway in Mathura rises to 13.

(With agency inputs)

GOA: Goa Police have sought transit remand for nightclub owners Gaurav and Saurabh Luthra, arguing that their presence in Goa is crucial for a critical stage of the investigation into the deadly fire. The police told a Delhi court that the blaze occurred after a fireworks event was organised at their nightclub without proper fire-safety equipment and other essential safety measures.In submissions to the Patiala House Court, the Goa Police stated that the Luthra brothers are the principal owners and partners of Birch by Romeo Lane in North Goa’s Arpora area, holding full control over the club’s operations, safety arrangements, permissions, and events conducted on the premises.It was alleged that on December 6, a firework was organised at the club without proper care, caution or adequate firefighting equipment, which led to a massive fire resulting in the death of 25 persons, including staff and tourists, and serious injuries to several others.The police further submitted that the investigation is at a critical stage, with the recovery of key documents such as licences, event permissions, and internal communications still pending, and that the conspiracy behind the incident is yet to be unearthed.It was also pointed out that the accused had allegedly absconded abroad after the incident and was arrested only after returning to India.After reviewing the submissions, FIR, arrest memos, and case diary, Duty Metropolitan Magistrate Twinkle Chawla approved the transit remand but limited it to 48 hours from the time of custody.The court noted that there is sufficient material at this stage indicating the accused’s involvement, while further investigation would fall under the jurisdiction of the competent court in Goa.While granting the remand, the court instructed the investigating officer to ensure the accused are kept in safe and secure custody during transit and to produce them before the relevant court in Goa immediately upon arrival.The magistrate also took note of the medical status of the accused, observing that they were fit to travel, and directed that all prescribed medicines and necessary medical care be provided to them during the transit period.Following the order, Advocate Surjendu Shankar Das, appearing for the State of Goa, said that the transit remand had been granted and that both accused would be taken to Goa.Visuals of early Wednesday morning from Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport showed the two in police custody following their deportation from Thailand and arrest by a Goa Police team.The Arpora nightclub fire on December 6 claimed 25 lives and led to criminal proceedings against the club owners for alleged negligence and breach of mandatory safety regulations.","Goa Police have sought transit remand for nightclub owners Gaurav and Saurabh Luthra.

Erika Kirk’s Fiery Warning Sparks Candace Owens' Clapback — Inside The 'Conspiracy' War

Erika Kirk calls meeting with Candace Owens “very productive”





Erika Kirk has offered a rare public assessment of her long-awaited sit-down with Candace Owens, calling the meeting “very productive” despite months of tension fueled by conspiracy theories surrounding her husband’s killing. Since conservative activist Charlie Kirk was fatally shot in September, Owens, once considered a close ally, had promoted unsubstantiated claims that questioned the official narrative of his death.Those theories deeply angered Kirk’s widow, who has since taken over leadership of Turning Point USA and publicly urged Owens to stop. Their private, hours-long conversation now marks a fragile attempt to reset a relationship strained by grief, mistrust, and public scrutiny.Following the four-and-a-half-hour meeting, Kirk shared a brief message on X, writing, “Had a very productive conversation with [Owens]. More to come from both of us.” Owens echoed the sentiment, saying, “We agreed much more than I had anticipated. Of course, we also disagreed on various points and people as well. Most importantly, we were able to share intel and clarify intent.”The meeting came after Owens repeatedly speculated that forces beyond the accused gunman were involved in Kirk’s assassination, including claims implicating foreign governments and even Turning Point USA associates.Law enforcement, however, maintains that Tyler Robinson acted alone. Prosecutors allege Robinson shot Kirk during an outdoor event at Utah Valley University and later texted his roommate, “I had enough of [Kirk’s] hatred. Some hate can’t be negotiated out.”Despite acknowledging the official account during her podcast, Owens continued to express doubt. “I said one of the reasons why I really want to sit down is because I want to walk out of here and feel confident saying to my audience, ‘Hey, there's stuff going on behind the scenes, but Tyler Robinson shot Charlie Kirk,’” she said. Yet Owens added that a conversation with Turning Point’s lawyer left her unconvinced, stating, “I don't believe that Tyler Robinson pulled the trigger. ”For Erika Kirk, the meeting appears less about agreement and more about containment. With Turning Point USA under intense pressure and legal proceedings ahead, her willingness to engage Owens signals an effort to prevent further damage, even as fundamental disagreements over Charlie Kirk’s death remain firmly unresolved.Also Read: Candace Owens accuses Erika Kirk of evading answers as ‘Egyptian plane’ theory resurfaces in Charlie Kirk murder case","Erika Kirk met privately with Candace Owens after months of frustration over conspiracy claims surrounding Charlie Kirk’s assassination.

Since then, the situation has grown more heated.Candace Owens has shared several theories about Kirk’s death and has claimed that some people inside Turning Point USA may be linked to what happened.Tucker Carlson has also said he does not trust the FBI investigation. Marjorie Taylor Greene has voiced support for parts of their concerns.In the middle of all this public fighting, John Crist’s comments suggest something very different is happening behind closed doors.John Crist spoke about this on the December 10 episode of the “Net Positive With John Crist” podcast after attending a recent Tucker Carlson event.He said everyone many people think are enemies were actually calm and friendly in person.Crist said:“And I was like, I go, all right, this is what, and this is what I always have thought about those kind of things, and I’ll just say it out loud for everybody, listening, and I’ve said this before in some kind of context. There was Turning Point people there. And Candace Owens was there. Marjorie Taylor, Tucker Carlson. I hate to say this out loud, out loud. Everybody friends. Everybody friends.”Crist then compared it to politics in Washington, saying public fights do not always match private behavior.He said:“And I’ve said that before, and I go, oh, I, and I think, I’ve heard before about Washington, DC. It’s like, we saw like the Democratic majority leader and like the Republican, they’re at dinner. I go, yeah, everybody friends. And everybody, like, kind of in, like, we would see, like, let’s say, like Theo’s, good buddy of ours, he would be, like, doing something. You were like, oh, yeah, they, it’s kind of just they, for the thing, for their job. ”Crist added that he was surprised, because he believed they would be openly fighting.Meanwhile, Candace Owens, in a November 12 YouTube video, claimed that Utah Valley University warned Turning Point USA about safety concerns before Kirk’s event.Owens said:“UVU recommended to Turning Point that they not hold the event in the amphitheatre because of safety reasons. ‘Not a good idea because we can’t shut this area down. It’s not a good idea because there’s no control here. We cannot control the flow of traffic coming in and out of this amphitheatre.’”She added:“But, Turning Point insisted that that was where they wanted to have the event. It was because Turning Point insisted, that the event wasn’t held outside. Now, I can tell you, having done these events, that was the first thing, among many, that struck me as odd, that anyone could just walk into…that’s the whole point of safety.”Candace Owens has also claimed that Charlie Kirk messaged a Turning Point USA member shortly before his death. These claims remain allegations, and no official agency has confirmed them.Also Read: What Really Happened Between Candace Owens And Erika Kirk?

Wedding bells soon? FBI director Kash Patel’s girlfriend Alexis Wilkins fuels engagement buzz online,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/wedding-bells-soon-fbi-director-kash-patels-girlfriend-alexis-wilkins-fuels-engagement-buzz-online/articleshow/125994978.cms,"Kash Patel Justifies Using FBI Aircraft To Visit Girlfriend Alexis Wilkins





It’s not every day that an FBI director finds himself at the centre of a social-media nudge toward matrimony — but Kash Patel ’s love life is suddenly trending almost as much as his job.Patel’s country-singer girlfriend, Alexis Wilkins , appears to be waging a very public, emoji-laced “propose already” campaign, amplifying hints, reposts and playful prods that suggest she’s ready for an engagement ring sooner rather than later.The online cheerleading comes at an awkward moment for the 45-year-old FBI chief, whose relationship with the 27-year-old aspiring musician has already drawn scrutiny over his alleged use of bureau perks to visit and protect her. Still, Patel has stood firmly by Wilkins — and she seems more than happy to stand right beside him, preferably with a ring involved.On Monday Wilkins shared an X post by right-wing activist Xaviaer DuRousseau praising Patel after news of foiled New Year’s Eve bomb plots in Los Angeles.DuRousseau wrote, “God bless you @FBIDirectorKash 🙏🏾 And please propose to my friend soon 😌” Wilkins responded, “Xaviaer over here with facts 😉” She later reposted his Instagram story, adding, “Ride or D1e KING over here 🫶 @xaviaer.”Katie Miller, wife of former Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, teased Patel and Wilkins’ appearance on her podcast, asking, “Where’s her ring?” with both Patel and Wilkins laughing in the clip.Patel defended their relationship in an X post, calling Wilkins “the woman I’m proud to call my partner in life,” and “a country music sensation who has done more for this nation than most will in ten lifetimes.”Insiders told MS Now that Patel twice ordered Wilkins’s security detail to drive a friend home and in one instance shouted at the team leader to comply. News of Patel’s use of $60 million in private jet services and the assignment of SWAT agents prompted national outcry.Rumours that Patel’s position is at risk have circulated, following criticism of his handling of cases including the Brown University mass shooting. White House Secretary Karoline Leavitt dismissed speculation that Patel would be dismissed, posting a photograph of Patel with President Donald Trump from November.","Kash Patel’s country-singer girlfriend, Alexis Wilkins, appears to be waging a very public, emoji-laced “propose already” campaign.

Trump orders blockade of Venezuelan oil tankers: Oil prices jump; supply risks rise,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trump-orders-blockade-of-venezuelan-oil-tankers-oil-prices-jump-supply-risks-rise/articleshow/126029793.cms,"Venezuela EXPLODES: Pro-Maduro Rallies Sweep Caracas After Trump Seizes Oil Tanker | Watch

Oil prices rose sharply on Wednesday after US President Donald Trump ordered ""a total and complete"" blockade of all sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela, stoking fresh geopolitical tensions at a time when markets are already wary about weak global demand.Brent crude futures climbed 57 cents, or 0.9%, to $59.50 a barrel by 0135 GMT, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude gained 59 cents, or 1%, to $55.86 a barrel.The rebound came a day after oil prices settled near five-year lows, pressured by progress in Russia-Ukraine peace talks. A potential deal could lead to easing of Western sanctions on Moscow, increasing supply in an already well-supplied market.Earlier on Tuesday, Trump ordered a blockade of sanctioned oil tankers linked to Venezuela and said he now regarded the country’s rulers as a foreign terrorist organisation.The move could disrupt about 0.4–0.5 million barrels per day of supply and lift prices by $1–2 per barrel, according to a US oil trader.""In regard to pricing impacts, we should see the prompt physical premiums reacting more than flat price, especially natural Merey replacements in the Gulf Coast like Canadian and Colombian Castilla blends, though the total loss of supply would be less than 200,000 barrels per day for the Chevron equity cargoes,"" Matias Togni, analyst at oil market insights firm Next Barrel, told Reuters.Another analysts said that the oil market is currently well supplied, but warned that if the blockade remains in place for an extended period, crude prices could move higher.It remains unclear how the US will enforce the blockade or whether it will deploy the Coast Guard, as it did last week. In recent months, Washington has moved warships into the region.Trump’s latest move follows the US seizure of a sanctioned oil tanker off Venezuela’s coast last week, stepping up pressure on the government of President Nicolas Maduro, whom Trump has accused of allowing drugs to enter the US.Since the seizure, Venezuela’s crude exports have fallen sharply. While many tankers lifting oil from the country are under sanctions, others transporting Venezuelan crude, as well as oil from Iran and Russia, remain unsanctioned. Tankers chartered by Chevron are also shipping Venezuelan crude to the US under a prior authorisation from Washington.","Brent crude futures climbed 57 cents, or 0.9%, to $59.50 a barrel by 0135 GMT.

Republican senator Eric Schmitt took to social media to slam the Democratic states that are trying to block the Trump administration's H1-B crackdown.In a lengthy post on X, Schmitt described how each Blue state is using the visa programme for certain reasons and hence trying to block the GOP crackdown.The MAGA senator said: ""20 Democrat states are suing the Trump Administration to block its H-1B visa crackdown. These states claim they need H-1Bs to import skilled foreign workers.

He said that California's AG, Rob Bonta, accused the Trump administration of trying to ""shut out the skilled workers America depends on.""Schmitt said that California has been the site of some of the most ""egregious H-1B abuse.""He used the example of Southern California Edison: Hundreds of US tech workers were laid off and then forced to train their H-1B replacements just to receive their severance package.One laid-off American worker said: ""They told us they could replace one of us with three, four, or five Indian personnel and still save money. They said, we can get four Indian guys for cheaper than the price of you.""Eric then took aim at Democratic Tony Ever's Wisconsin. The Republican claimed that motorcycle manufacturer Harley Davidson, headquartered in Milwaukee, has been sued in federal court for partnering with Indian outsourcing firms to lay off Wisconsin IT workers and force them to train their H-1B replacements.Like other Blue strongholds, Eric said that multiple major companies in Connecticut have fired American tech workers in high numbers and forced them to train their H-1B replacements.Eric claimed that one laid-off American in Connecticut was forced to train 10 additional workers back in India via web conferencing.Schmitt said that Illinois is ""another plaintiff."" He claimed that Illinois' Democratic senator Dick Durbin has been pushing for H-1B reform for decades.The US workers who were fired in the state put American flags outside their cubicles in protest before they left.Eric said that New Jersey is ""home to Toys ""R"" Us, which brought in H-1B workers from India to shadow employees for weeks (even following them to the restroom) so the foreign workers could create manuals on how to do the jobs themselves. Then the Americans were laid off.""Eric said that Microsoft recently announced mass layoffs while applying for thousands of H-1B visas in the Blue stronghold.Schmitt claimed that Minnesota's largest employers have laid off hundreds of IT workers and outsourced them to India.

Bondi Beach shooting : 11 dead, shooters seized





As panic spread across Sydney’s Bondi Beach during a deadly shooting at a Hanukkah celebration, one man put his life on the line to stop the gunfire.His name is Ahmed al Ahmed, a 43-year-old fruit shop owner who is now being hailed as a hero for tackling and disarming one of the attackers. The heroic act was caught on camera and went viral following the shooting.Ahmed is a father of two from Sydney’s south. He was walking past the area when two gunmen opened fire near the Chanukah By The Sea, a Jewish celebration on Sunday. The gathering was held near a children’s playground and hundreds of families were there for the event.Footage online shows Ahmed, dressed in a white shirt, crouching behind parked cars as shots ring out. At the right moment, he rushed forward and grabbed one of the gunmen from behind, placing him in a headlock. After a violent struggle lasting several seconds, Ahmed wrestles the shotgun from the attacker, forcing him to retreat.In the video, Ahmed can later be seen sitting on the ground as bystanders rush to help him. A towel is brought to stop the bleeding from his leg. He was shot twice. Despite being wounded, he remains conscious and places the seized weapon against a tree.His cousin, Mustafa, spoke to 7News and said Ahmed was undergoing treatment in the hospital.“He’s in hospital and we don’t know exactly what’s going on inside,” Mustafa said. “We do hope he will be fine. He’s a hero 100 per cent.”Ahmed was reportedly due to undergo surgery and had no prior experience handling firearms. According to family members, he acted out of instinct to protect others.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the heroic act, describing it as “the pinnacle of Jewish heroism”.Police said two shooters were involved in the attack. One was shot dead at the scene, while the other was critically injured and taken into custody.Moments after Ahmed disarmed the first attacker, police moved in. An officer approached from behind the bridge and shot the remaining gunman dead. Separate footage later showed officers administering CPR to one of the suspects.At least 11 were killed in the attack.

Trump Roasted Over 'Lack Of Empathy' After Insensitive Remark On Brown University Shooting

(Photo released by police)

Hundreds of tips, but questions over cameras and campus security





A city on edge as victims’ stories emerge









Police investigating the deadly shooting at Brown University have released a new video timeline and clearer images of a masked suspect, as authorities continue an intensive search across Providence with no arrest yet made. The attack on Saturday left two students dead and nine others wounded.At a news conference on Tuesday, Providence Police Chief Oscar Perez presented what he described as an “enhanced” compilation of surveillance footage showing a person of interest moving around the Brown campus and nearby streets. The video appears stitched together from home security cameras and shows the suspect walking for about an hour, beginning shortly after 2 pm, within a few blocks of the engineering building where the shooting occurred at 4.03 pm.In all publicly released footage, the suspect’s face is either masked or turned away. Investigators have described him only in broad terms: stocky, about 5 feet 8 inches tall, wearing dark or brown clothing, including a jacket, hat, gloves and a shoulder bag. In some clips, the person is seen passing the same properties multiple times. In another, he abruptly turns and runs in the opposite direction when someone approaches.Footage taken minutes after the shooting shows the person walking away from a parking lot and continuing along a nearby street. Chief Perez said investigators believe the individual was “casing” the area beforehand, adding that such behaviour is typical of criminals preparing for an attack.Police, working alongside the FBI and state authorities, said around 200 tips have been received so far. Officers have been canvassing homes, yards and dumpsters in surrounding neighbourhoods, urging residents to recheck their camera systems for even fleeting images that could help identify the suspect.“We’re looking for a moment that is shorter than someone taking a breath,” Perez said. Despite Brown University having around 1,200 campus cameras, officials confirmed there is no clear footage from inside the engineering building itself, a gap that has frustrated investigators and raised wider concerns about security.Attorney General Peter Neronha said the investigation was going “really well” but urged patience, warning against speculation about motive or ideology. Brown President Christina Paxson defended the university’s emergency response, explaining why campus sirens were not activated, saying this could have driven people towards danger rather than away from it.Providence remained tense on Tuesday, with extra police deployed to schools and all after-school activities cancelled as a precaution. Parents spoke of fear, while students questioned whether security measures alone could prevent such violence.Details have also emerged about the victims. Two wounded students had been released from hospital, while others remained in critical or stable conditions. Among those killed was 19-year-old Ella Cook, a sophomore described by her church as a bright and uplifting presence. The other victim, 18-year-old MukhammadAziz Umurzokov, a freshman majoring in biochemistry and neuroscience, had long dreamed of becoming a neurosurgeon after overcoming serious health challenges as a child.","Police have released a new video timeline and clearer images of a masked suspect.

The attendee, who did not speak to the Reiners at the party, said that people seemed to be very aware of Nick Reiner's history with drug abuse, which the family has discussed publicly.Another attendee said that he did not witness the dispute, but he recognised Rob Reiner in the crowd and noticed the younger Reiner hovering at the fringes of the informal gathering.The guest said that he and other attendees were worried and that several people commented to him on Nick Reiner's behaviour, saying he looked anxious and uncomfortable in a way that deeply unsettled them. A third person who attended the party said that he saw the Reiners but did not see the argument.

Neighbours and acquaintances said that Nick Reiner's struggles with drugs and alcohol were common knowledge in the affluent West Los Angeles enclave.In 2016, the father and son released a semi-autobiographical film, ""Being Charlie,"" about a Los Angeles teen who abused drugs and who had a turbulent relationship with his father.

Maduro’s response and regional fallout







US President Donald Trump has sharply escalated his confrontation with Venezuela, ordering what he called a “total and complete” blockade of sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving the country and declaring the Maduro government a “foreign terrorist organisation”.Announcing the decision late on Tuesday, Trump accused President Nicolás Maduro’s government of using oil revenues to finance drug trafficking and organised crime, while vowing to expand the US military presence around the South American nation. The announcement follows weeks of rising tension, including naval deployments, air patrols and the seizure of an oil tanker off Venezuela’s coast.Trump’s order targets all sanctioned oil vessels travelling to and from Venezuela, effectively formalising what oil traders say had already become a de facto embargo after US forces seized a tanker last week carrying an estimated two million barrels of Venezuelan crude.Since then, several tankers loaded with oil have remained in Venezuelan waters rather than risk interception.The administration has moved thousands of troops and nearly a dozen warships into the Caribbean, including an aircraft carrier, alongside maritime patrol aircraft and helicopters capable of tracking shipping routes across the region. While the White House has not detailed how the blockade will be enforced, analysts expect the US Navy and Coast Guard to play a central role.Oil markets reacted cautiously, with prices edging higher amid fears that Venezuelan exports could fall sharply. Venezuela produces about one million barrels of oil a day, exporting most of it. Any prolonged disruption could remove close to a million barrels a day from global supply, although traders note that supplies remain ample for now.The impact has been compounded by a cyberattack this week that disrupted systems at PDVSA, Venezuela’s state oil company, further slowing exports. Economists warn that a sustained blockade could trigger shortages of food and medicine by cutting off the country’s ability to earn foreign currency.Maduro’s government has condemned the blockade as illegal and accused Washington of piracy and economic warfare. In a statement, Caracas said Trump was violating international law and the principle of free navigation, adding that Venezuela would raise the issue at the United Nations.Speaking before Trump’s announcement, Maduro said the US was seeking to “colonise Venezuela” to seize its oil, gas and mineral wealth, and pledged to defend the country’s sovereignty. Venezuelan officials have also accused neighbouring Trinidad and Tobago of cooperating with the US during last week’s tanker seizure.Washington insists the military campaign is aimed at stopping drugs reaching the United States. Since early September, US forces have carried out more than 20 strikes on boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, killing at least 95 people, according to official figures. The Pentagon has defended the strikes as lawful and effective, despite growing scrutiny from lawmakers.","US President Donald Trump has sharply escalated his confrontation with Venezuela.

The new proclamation continues full restrictions and entry limitations of nationals from the original 12 high-risk countries: Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen.

It adds full restrictions and entry limitations on five additional countries based on recent analysis: Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, South Sudan, and Syria, as well as individuals holding Palestinian-Authority-issued travel documents.

The new order imposes full restrictions and entry limitations on two countries that were previously subject to partial restrictions: Laos and Sierra Leone.

It continues partial restrictions on nationals from four of the seven original high-risk countries: Burundi, Cuba, Togo, and Venezuela.

The new proclamation lifts the existing ban on non-immigrant visas from Turkmenistan as it has engaged productively with the United States.

This adds partial restrictions and entry limitations on 15 additional countries: Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Cote d’Ivoire, Dominica, Gabon, The Gambia, Malawi, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Tonga, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.

The proclamation includes exceptions for lawful permanent residents, existing visa holders, certain visa categories like athletes and diplomats, and individuals whose entry serves U.S. national interests.

The proclamation also narrows broad family-based immigrant visa carve-outs that carry demonstrated fraud risks, while preserving case-by-case waivers.

The Donald Trump administration expanded the travel ban to over 30 countries now as part of its ongoing crackdown on immigration after the arrest of an Afghan national suspect in the shooting of two National Guard troops over Thanksgiving weekend. In June, President Donald Trump announced that citizens of 12 countries would be banned from visiting the United States and those from seven others would face restrictions.The Trump administration said in its announcement of the expanded travel ban that many of the countries from which it was restricting travel had “widespread corruption, fraudulent or unreliable civil documents and criminal records” that made it difficult to vet their citizens for travel to the U.S.It also said some countries had high rates of people overstaying their visas, refused to take back their citizens who the U.S. wished to deport or had a “general lack of stability and government control,” which made vetting difficult.Also includedIndividuals holding Palestinian Authority issued travel documentsLaosSierra Leone","In June, President Donald Trump announced that citizens of 12 countries would be banned from visiting the United States and those from seven others would face restrictions.

Two children have been killed and more than a dozen others injured in a blast at a seminary in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in an incident that has deepened anxiety in a region already struggling with insecurity.Police said the explosion occurred in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali area at about 2pm after students brought a mortar shell into Madressah Shams-ul-Quran, having mistaken it for a toy they found outside, Dawn reported.The device detonated while the children were playing with it, killing two instantly and injuring 16 others. Several of the wounded were later transferred to hospitals in Bannu and nearby districts.Local officials said security forces had earlier warned residents that an unexploded mortar had landed in the area and urged civilians to avoid it. However, the warning did not reach everyone, and the children unknowingly carried the device into the seminary, as per Dawn.The incident came amid growing concern about public safety in North Waziristan, which on the same day saw a separate overnight attack that destroyed a government primary school in Mir Ali. Officials said explosives were planted at the building in Ayaz Kot, leaving more than 600 children without a place to study.Much of the structure was reduced to rubble, prompting authorities to seal the site and begin planning temporary arrangements for classes.Parents and elders condemned the destruction as a deliberate assault on the community’s future. One elder said the school had been “the heart of our community”, describing its loss as an attack on children’s hopes, Express Tribune reported.Security forces have launched a search operation, though no group has claimed responsibility. District officials called the bombing an “anti-education act” and promised those responsible would be brought to justice. Initial assessments suggest the explosives were detonated remotely or with a timer.","Two children killed and more than a dozen others injured in blast at a seminary in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Pakistan’s military and intelligence agencies face the daunting task of differentiating between groups that sometimes share fluid alliances or conflicting rivalries. Heavy-handed military operations risk alienating local populations and driving recruitment, while political engagement with some groups risks being seen as appeasement. International implications India, Iran, and even China watch these internal Trojan horses with varying stakes. India’s support to Baloch separatists, Iran’s concerns about Baloch unrest along its border, and China’s economic interests in Balochistan add layers of strategic complexity.

Conventional approaches falter

Military campaigns may suppress one group temporarily but provide recruits and sympathy to another.

Political negotiations get undermined when factions splinter or external events shift local calculations—such as the Taliban’s victory in Afghanistan.

Economic development efforts in Balochistan are hampered by ongoing violence but are critical to addressing root causes.

Cross-border sanctuaries and international gray zones complicate decisive action.

Multi-pronged strategy

Enhanced Border Security and Regional Diplomacy Strengthening border management with Afghanistan and Iran, paired with robust diplomatic engagement, can limit militant sanctuaries and cross-border flows.

The challenges Pakistan faces today are often described in binary terms — a threat here, a conflict there — but the reality is far more chaotic and intricate, much like the scientific conundrum known as the ""three-body problem"". This problem, rooted in physics and celestial mechanics, deals with predicting the motions of three gravitational bodies interacting with each other. The paradox is that while two bodies' orbits can be predicted with relative simplicity, introducing a third body creates a system so unstable and non-linear that exact forecasts become practically impossible. Pakistan's existential security dilemmas resemble this dynamic complexity: three powerful, interrelated forces that simultaneously influence and destabilize the country’s internal and external equilibrium.These three forces are the Taliban , the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ), and the Baloch insurgency.Individually, each represents a serious security threat. Collectively, their interactions generate overlapping, tangled challenges that confound policy, military strategy, and diplomatic efforts.Recent escalations are a stark reminder of this peril. In October 2025, Pakistan launched airstrikes in Kabul and other Afghan sites targeting TTP leader Noor Wali Mehsud, prompting Taliban retaliation on Pakistani border posts and further Pakistani precision strikes killing dozens of militants.Meanwhile, Baloch attacks surged 53% in 2024 to 938 incidents with over 1,002 fatalities, spilling into 2025 with high-profile hits on CPEC projects.Over 300 attacks rocked Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2025 alone, mostly TTP-led.For the first time since 2015, the number of terror attacks in Pakistan crossed the 900-mark.Grasping their interplay is crucial to understanding why Pakistan’s security apparatus struggles to restore stability — and why conventional approaches have so far failed.The Taliban, an Islamist militant group born in Afghanistan in the mid-1990s, rose to international prominence with its capture of Kabul in 1996.Following the US invasion after 9/11, the group was ousted but persisted with insurgency tactics. The Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan in 2021 reshaped regional dynamics and profoundly impacted Pakistan.For Pakistan, the Taliban's ascendance is something of a double-edged sword. On one hand, Islamabad sees the group as a strategic asset to exert influence in Kabul and counter Indian presence in Afghanistan. On the other hand, the Taliban's ideological affinity with Pakistan's own Pashtun tribal regions and cross-border networks complicates Islamabad's control over militancy within its own borders.The Taliban's ideology and governance style also inspire elements within Pakistan, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the tribal belt. This ideological inspiration runs parallel to fears that the group's Afghan governance failures or hardline policies could spill over, destabilising Pakistan’s own tribal regions.The Afghan Taliban's 2021 takeover initially promised Pakistan leverage against India, but it backfired spectacularly. Kabul's refusal to dismantle TTP sanctuaries hosting 6,000-6,500 fighters armed with leftover NATO weapons has fueled Islamabad's woes. Tensions peaked in December 2025 with heavy cross-border fire exchanges killing five Afghans, amid soured ties since 2021.Experts like Tahir Khan note the Taliban's inaction strains relations, pushing Pakistan to airstrikes that risk radicalising more TTP factions toward rivals like ISKP. Failed Istanbul peace talks in October 2025 saw Pakistan threaten to ""obliterate"" the Taliban regime after unmet demands on TTP expulsion. Sirajuddin Haqqani dismissed TTP as Pakistan's ""internal matter,"" vowing forceful responses to violations.This dynamic grants TTP ""strategic depth"" unparalleled in its history, enabling mergers and centralisation under Mehsud. As analyst Hazrat Ali warns, Pakistani pressure on Kabul could splinter TTP, worsening regional chaos.Pakistan’s newly appointed armed forces chief Gen. Asim Munir recently called on Afghanistan’s Taliban government to choose between maintaining ties with Islamabad or supporting the Pakistani Taliban.Munir said that a “clear message” had been delivered to the Taliban government in Kabul: it must decide between Pakistan and “Fitna al-Khawarij,” a term authorities use for the outlawed Pakistani Taliban, known a s Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan.While the Afghan Taliban exerts influence across the border, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan represents a homegrown, highly violent insurgency directly challenging the Pakistani state’s writ. Originating as an umbrella militant organisation around 2007, the TTP embodies a coalition of various Islamist militants and tribal groups united against Islamabad's military operations.The TTP has been responsible for some of the deadliest terrorist attacks in Pakistan over the past decade, targeting military installations, government buildings, schools, and civilian populations. Despite several attempted peace negotiations, the TTP's fractured yet resilient network has shown a capacity to regroup, regrouping largely within the tribal regions of northwestern Pakistan and even spilling across the Afghan border during periods of instability.The group opposes Pakistan’s state institutions vehemently and views the military, intelligence agencies, and secular political frameworks as existential enemies. Unlike the Afghan Taliban, which now nominally controls Kabul, the TTP pursues a more violent, confrontational agenda rooted in the Pakistani context.The TTP roared back post-Taliban victory. In 2024, it drove over half of 900+ attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, killing 560+, with 67% targeting security forces. By 2025, its operations hit 600+ confrontations, surpassing all of 2024.A stark October 8, 2025, ambush in Kurram killed 11 Pakistani soldiers, including two officers, via roadside bombs and heavy weapons—exposing border vulnerabilities.TTP now eyes tribal belt control, mirroring Afghan Taliban's path, per CTC West Point analysis. Mehsud's unification of splinters has boosted recruitment, with propaganda invoking Baloch grievances to broaden appeal.Security data shows 96% of attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, blending armed assaults and IEDs, as TTP demands military divestment from businesses. This resurgence, analysts say, stems from Afghan havens, turning Pakistan's past militant proxies into monsters.Simultaneously, Pakistan faces an insurgency in Balochistan—a sprawling, resource-rich, but underdeveloped southwestern province. The Baloch nationalist movement goes back decades, demanding greater autonomy, resource control, and sometimes outright independence. The insurgency has fluctuated in intensity but remains a persistent thorn in Islamabad’s side.Baloch militants have targeted Pakistani security forces, infrastructure projects, and economic installations such as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)—a flagship regional development initiative. The province's rugged terrain and Baloch tribal dynamics create a challenging environment for Pakistani counterinsurgency efforts.Unlike the religious militancy of the Taliban and TTP, the Baloch insurgency is rooted in ethnic nationalism and grievances over political marginalization, economic neglect, and human rights abuses. This ideological and geographical distinctiveness makes it harder for the Pakistani state to craft a unified internal security strategy.Attacks ballooned to 327 sites across 25 districts in 2024, with 80% fatality spike to 1,002+. The March 11, 2025, Jaffar Express hijacking by BLA-Jeeyand killed 26 hostages and kidnapped 400+, showcasing tactical evolution from hit-and-runs to coordinated ops.CPEC remains prime target: Operation Dara-e-Bolan in January 2024 and March 2025 barrages hit Chinese workers, amid Israel-Iran and India-Pakistan tensions stoking fears of wider nexuses. BLA's sophistication targets BRI, militarizing the region further.Unlike TTP's jihadism, Baloch fights for autonomy, but heavy state crackdowns alienate locals, per CTC analysis. Injuries rose to 689, property losses to 546, signaling expanded reach despite counter-ops killing 76 insurgents.Here lies Pakistan’s three-body problem: the Taliban, TTP, and Baloch insurgency don’t operate in isolation.Their influences collide, interact, and ripple across Pakistan’s geopolitical landscape in unpredictable ways.Traditional counterinsurgency and counterterrorism strategies rely on clear, identifiable enemies that can be neutralised through military might, intelligence operations, or negotiated settlements. The three-body dynamic, however, forces Pakistan to wrestle with fluid, overlapping, and at times contradictory challenges.In essence, each ""body"" in this problem pulls Pakistan’s security landscape in different directions, making any single policy or operation insufficient.Addressing this three-body problem requires Pakistan to adopt a holistic, integrated strategy that acknowledges the distinct yet intertwined nature of these challenges.Pakistan's military has intensified operations since mid-2025 to counter the Taliban-TTP-Baloch nexus, focusing on intelligence-based strikes (IBOs), cross-border actions, and sustained ground campaigns amid over 1,000 attacks nationwide. These efforts emphasize decapitation of TTP leadership, border denial, and Baloch insurgency suppression, though resource strains from multi-front threats limit gains.The army launched precision airstrikes into Afghanistan targeting TTP hideouts. On October 9, 2025, raids hit Kabul, Khost, Jalalabad, and Paktika, aiming at TTP chief Noor Wali Mehsud's headquarters, killing dozens of militants despite his survival claim. Retaliatory Taliban attacks on border posts prompted further Pakistani strikes on October 11-12, neutralizing Taliban brigades and TTP operatives.Recent IBOs in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa yielded kills: December 5-6 saw nine TTP fighters eliminated in Tank and Lakki Marwat districts. September 13 clashes in South Waziristan and Lower Dir killed 35 militants but cost 19 soldiers, highlighting ambush risks. December 6-7 Chaman border strikes destroyed three Taliban bases, killing 23 fighters after ceasefire violations.Operation Azm-e-Istehkam, ramped up in summer 2025, reports near-daily TTP neutralizations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, addressing a terrorism surge to highest levels since 2015.In Balochistan, May 2025 operations deployed over 40 vehicles in Surab, Zehri, and Khuzdar, declaring areas ""sensitive"" to hunt Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) amid 70+ attacks under Operation Herof. August 30 actions post-BLA civilian strikes killed five insurgents and captured two in Kech, part of Azm-e-Istehkam's escalation.Security forces targeted BLA convoys, camps, and intelligence squads, seizing arms despite BLA claims of 25 blockades and 15 camp captures in 2024-2025. These ops focus on CPEC protection, countering 938 incidents with 1,002 fatalities in 2024 extending into 2025.The ongoing volatility reveals that no single strategy will yield a definitive victory; instead, Pakistan must adopt nuanced, integrated policies that combine hard military pressure with political dialogue, regional diplomacy, and socioeconomic inclusion.The future of Pakistan’s sovereignty and regional peace depends on how skillfully it navigates this chaotic three-body problem, turning a disordered struggle into a managed equilibrium before the forces pull the nation into further unrest and fragmentation.","Pakistan’s western tribal belt and Balochistan both border Afghanistan and Iran, turning these regions into transnational conflict zones. There is evidence of ideological and tactical cross-pollination between the Afghan Taliban and the TTP. The Baloch insurgency, while largely ethnonationalist, has occasionally sought indirect or tactical alliances with other groups to magnify its impact.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125834167,imgsize-1257718,width-400,resizemode-4/pakistan39s-three-body-problem.jpg"
