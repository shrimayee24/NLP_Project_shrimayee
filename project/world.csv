How Russia's S-400 helped India in Operation Sindoor against Pakistan



NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin were seen sharing light moments and walking hand-in-hand during the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit in Tianjin on Monday, while Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif looked on as the leaders passed him during the group photo session.PM Modi, Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping were also seen laughing together and engaging in a cordial conversation, underscoring the camaraderie among the three leaders at the summit.“Interactions in Tianjin continue! Exchanging perspectives with President Putin and President Xi during the SCO Summit,” PM Modi posted on X, along with pictures from the event.Foreign secretary Vikram Misri confirmed that Pm Modi will address the plenary session of the 25th SCO Heads of State Council Summit later in the day. “Prime Minister will be addressing the plenary session of the Summit, where he will outline India’s approach to fostering regional cooperation under the SCO umbrella,” Misri said.Following the plenary, PM Modi is scheduled to hold a bilateral meeting with Putin. On Sunday, PM Modi also met Xi, where both leaders agreed that India and China are “development partners, not rivals.”They emphasised the need for peace along the border, supported a mutually acceptable resolution of the boundary issue, and agreed to resume direct flights.Modi also invited Xi to attend the 2026 Brics Summit in India.In another engagement, PM Modi met Xi’s close aide Cai Qi in Tianjin. During the meeting, PM Modi shared his vision for India-China relations, while Cai reaffirmed Beijing’s intent to deepen exchanges. Misri said a banquet was replaced by a brief interaction due to scheduling constraints.The SCO currently has 10 member states, with India becoming a full member in 2017.Meanwhile, India’s S-400 “Sudarshan Chakra” missile defence systems played a crucial role during “Operation Sindoor” on the night of May 7 and 8. The Indian Air Force successfully intercepted Pakistani drones and missiles aimed at 15 Indian cities, according to ANI reports quoting domain experts.Officials confirmed that debris from Pakistani drones and missiles was recovered at multiple sites, providing evidence of the attack. India’s Integrated Counter-UAS Grid and Air Defence systems thwarted the attempt, preventing damage to key assets.The S-400 “Sudarshan Chakra” — India’s name for the Russian-made Triumf system — can engage targets up to 400 km away and detect threats as far as 600 km. Equipped with phased-array radar, it can track over 100 targets simultaneously and neutralise threats ranging from drones to ballistic missiles.India signed a $5.43 billion deal with Russia in 2018 for five S-400 units, the first of which was deployed in Punjab in 2021. The advanced system is seen as a game-changer in South Asia, bolstering India’s multi-layered air defence and giving it a strategic edge against Pakistan and China.The government described the May 7 strikes as “focused, measured, and non-escalatory,” clarifying that no Pakistani military installations were targeted. However, after Pakistan escalated on Wednesday, Indian forces struck back, neutralising Pakistani air defence systems, including one in Lahore.","PM Modi, Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping were also seen laughing together and engaging in a cordial conversation.

Health speculation lingers

Still firing on Truth Social





The internet’s strangest political rumor of the week, that Donald Trump had secretly died, was put to rest on Saturday when the President was photographed teeing off at his Virginia golf club.Dressed in a white polo, black slacks, and his trademark red MAGA cap, Trump appeared relaxed as he left the White House with his grandchildren before heading to the links. The White House press pool confirmed his departure in the presidential motorcade at 8:49 am, providing definitive proof that the 47th President is alive and well.For much of Saturday, Trump was the top trending search on Google and across social media platforms, with phrases like “Is Trump dead?” and “Trump is dead” flooding timelines. The rumors, though baseless, spread rapidly, fueled in part by his recent absence from the public eye and lingering speculation about his health.Trump’s last major appearance was on August 26, when he chaired a televised cabinet meeting. Before that, he was spotted on August 24 golfing in Virginia alongside former MLB pitcher Roger Clemens.Concerns about Trump’s health have persisted for weeks after photos surfaced of him with a large bruise on his right hand and visible swelling around his ankles.The White House did not address the images directly but last month released a letter confirming Trump had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), a condition linked to age and prolonged standing. Doctors have suggested the ankle swelling may be connected to routine aspirin use.Adding fuel to the rumor mill, Vice President JD Vance recently told USA Today that he was “ready to step in” if a “terrible tragedy” struck, though he emphasized that Trump remained in “great health.”Despite skipping public events this weekend, Trump has remained active online. Hours before his golf outing, he posted on Truth Social lashing out at a US appeals court for striking down most of his tariffs, a reminder that, contrary to internet whispers, the President is still very much at the helm.","The internet’s strangest political rumor of the week, that Donald Trump had secretly died, was put to rest on Saturday when the President was photographed teeing off at his Virginia golf club.

Farmer In Village, Sewadar In Delhi: Singh Handled 2 Jobs To Help Family





NEW DELHI: A 35-year-old sewadar was on Friday brutally beaten to death with sticks by a group of men inside the premises of southeast Delhi's Kalkaji Temple following a dispute over the distribution of chunni prasad.Police have arrested five people so far, including the father of one of the men for harbouring him.The victim, Yogendra Singh , hailed from Fattepur in Uttar Pradesh's Hardoi district, where he used to work as a farmer.

He recalled how Yogendra worked relentlessly and without complaining driven by the single goal of securing a better future for his children. His daughter, who has problems performing basic tasks with her arm and leg, has been undergoing treatment for over a year, costing the family over Rs 1.5 lakh.Yogendra, the youngest of three brothers, last met his wife, mother and two children when he left home two months ago.

India’s ‘Befitting Response’ To Trump’s 50% Tariffs; Sets Russian Oil 'Import Record' | Report





A US federal appeals court on Friday ruled that most tariffs imposed by president Donald Trump under emergency powers were illegal, striking at the heart of his trade policy and setting up a likely battle in the Supreme Court The ruling by the US court of appeals for the federal circuit in Washington, DC, covered two sets of tariffs - Trump’s “reciprocal” duties imposed in April as part of his trade war and another set announced in February against China, Canada and Mexico. It does not affect other tariffs Trump imposed under separate statutes, including those on steel and aluminum imports.In a 7-4 judgement the court observed: “The statute bestows significant authority on the President to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency, but none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax,” as quoted by Reuters.The decision also said Trump had exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).Trump had invoked IEEPA, a 1977 law historically used for sanctions and asset freezes, to justify tariffs by declaring a national emergency over persistent US trade deficits and cross-border drug flows. The administration argued that the law’s power to “regulate” imports extended to tariffs.The appeals court rejected that view, saying: “It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs. The statute neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the President’s power to impose tariffs.”The appeals court put its ruling on hold until October 14, allowing the Trump administration time to seek a reversal from the Supreme Court.Minutes after the ruling, President Donald Trump sharply criticised the judgement, saying if allowed it would be a “ total disaster for the Country”.In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, he attacked the appeals courts as ""Highly Partisan"" and asserted that the Supreme Court would rule in his favour.“If these Tariffs ever went away, it would be a total disaster for the Country,” Trump wrote in his post. “If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America.”“The President’s tariffs remain in effect, and we look forward to ultimate victory on this matter,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a separate statement, as quoted by CNBC.Trump has relied heavily on tariffs in his second term, using them as a central tool of US foreign policy to pressure trading partners and push for revised trade agreements. While the duties have helped his administration secure economic concessions, they have also added to uncertainty in financial markets.The lawsuits were filed separately by five small US businesses and a coalition of 12 Democratic-led states, who argued that under the Constitution, the power to issue taxes and tariffs lies with Congress and any delegation of that authority must be both explicit and limited.Trump had defended the tariffs as a way to rebalance global trade and protect US industries. He said the April tariffs were necessary because the US had imported more than it exported for decades, undermining manufacturing and military readiness.He also said the February tariffs against China, Canada and Mexico were justified because those countries were not doing enough to curb the flow of illegal fentanyl into the US - an assertion those governments have denied.The New York-based US Court of international trade had earlier ruled against Trump’s tariff policies on May 28, saying the president had exceeded his powers when imposing both sets of challenged tariffs. That three-judge panel included one judge appointed by Trump during his first term. Another court in Washington also found that IEEPA does not authorize tariffs, with the government appealing that decision.According to Reuters, at least eight lawsuits have been filed against Trump’s tariff measures, including one brought by the state of California.While the latest decision restricts tariffs imposed under IEEPA, it leaves intact those imposed under other legal authorities. The Justice Department is expected to appeal, with the case likely headed to the US Supreme Court.","US federal appeals court rules that most tariffs imposed by president Donald Trump under emergency powers were illegal.

Megh alleged that Yogesh killed his mother and sister and fled with the children. Sehgal was arrested and the cops seized his blood-stained clothes and a pair of scissors, the alleged weapon of offence.The murder is attributed to domestic disputes and frequent quarrels.""A dispute erupted between Priya and her unemployed husband, Yogesh, over gifts exchanged between the two families and Kusum stayed at Priya's residence to help resolve the issue,"" said Rajeev Ranjan, DCP (Rohini).When Megh couldn't reach his mother by phone on Saturday, he visited Priya's house and found the flat locked and spied bloodstains near the door.

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi landed in Tianjin Saturday evening for what is his first visit to China in 7 years, amid global trade disruptions and shifting alliances. The visit follows an almost year-long effort by both sides to narrow down their differences on the contentious border issue and normalise the relationship in the form of steps already taken like resumption of Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage for Indians and tourist visas for Chinese nationals.As has been reported earlier, Modi will have a bilateral meeting with President Xi Jinping on Sunday, the first of his many engagements over the next 2 days. However, among the highlights on the first day will also be a likely meeting with Myanmar’s acting president and military chief Min Aung Hlaing.“Landed in Tianjin, China. Looking forward to deliberations at the SCO Summit and meeting various world leaders,” said Modi in a post on X, after arriving in China.India has had limited high-level contacts with Myanmar since the military took control of state power in 2021 but this will be Modi’s second meeting with the Myanmar leader this year, after their talks on the margins of the BIMSTEC summit in Thailand. Ahead of a planned election in December, as announced by the military, Modi is likely to stress the importance of an early restoration of democracy in the country torn by ethnic violence through inclusive and credible polls and dialogue.Myanmar under its military has struggled to shed its pariah status in the West but continues to maintain strong ties with both China and India. For India, which has a 1600 km land border with Myanmar, it’s imperative to work with the military rulers to deal with the persistent challenge of border insurgency.While Modi is in China for the SCO summit, his most crucial engagement will likely be the meeting with Xi that is expected to cement the recent progress in ties after an almost 5-year-old military standoff. According to sources, the PM will approach the meeting with the intention to take the relationship forward with a long-term and strategic perspective. The meeting will take place at a time India’s relationship with the US is at its lowest ebb in decades. While both sides have not indicated signing of any big-ticket agreement, the leaders are expected to endorse efforts to resume direct air services between the 2 countries.There will be focus on trade and economic cooperation with Modi likely to underline the need for a fair trade partnership and seek a reaffirmation of the Chinese commitment to address India’s needs in critical areas like rare earths, fertilisers and equipment. Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi recently assured his counterpart S Jaishankar Beijing will lift curbs on export of some of these items. Modi is also likely to raise the issue of cross-border terrorism in the context of the recent Pahalgam terrorist attack.","PM Narendra Modi landed in Tianjin Saturday evening for what is his first visit to China in 7 years, amid global trade disruptions and shifting alliances.

Trump’s ‘Worst Nightmare’ Comes True: Putin’s Friends Modi & Xi Are All Smiles In China, Hold Talks





Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order directing city agencies and police to resist US President Donald Trump’s planned federal immigration enforcement surge, which could begin within days.The order, issued on Saturday, bars the Chicago Police Department from helping federal authorities with civil immigration enforcement, patrols, traffic stops, checkpoints, or arrest operations.Johnson said the measure was necessary to “guard the constitutional rights of Chicago residents amidst the possibility of imminent militarised immigration or National Guard deployment by the federal government,” according to news agency AP.When asked whether he would follow instructions from federal agents, Johnson replied, “Yeah, and I don’t take orders from the federal government.”The order also requires Chicago police, including undercover officers, to wear uniforms and prohibits them from covering their faces, contrasting with federal immigration officers, many of whom now wear masks since Trump took office. At the same time, Johnson urged federal officers deployed in Chicago to identify themselves with names, badge numbers and body cameras, Politico reported.Two US officials cited by AP said the immigration crackdown could start as early as September 5 and last for 30 days. The officials said the operation was part of a wider Trump administration strategy to expand federal law enforcement in Democratic-led cities, similar to earlier actions in Los Angeles.At a news conference, Johnson accused Trump of using federal power for political retribution, calling him ‘reckless and out of control.’“He’s the biggest threat to our democracy that we’ve experienced in the history of our country”, he added.Trump, in a Truth Social post on Saturday, pointed to Chicago’s recent gun violence and attacked Illinois Governor JB Pritzker. “Six people were killed, and 24 people were shot, in Chicago last weekend, and JB Pritzker, the weak and pathetic Governor of Illinois, just said that he doesn’t need help in preventing CRIME. He is CRAZY!!! He better straighten it out, FAST, or we’re coming!”The White House described Johnson’s executive order as a “publicity stunt.” Spokeswoman Abigail Jackson was quoted as saying by CNN, “If these Democrats focused on fixing crime in their own cities instead of doing publicity stunts to criticise the President, their communities would be much safer. Cracking down on crime should not be a partisan issue.”Illinois governor Pritzker also condemned Trump’s plan, accusing the administration of trying to “circumvent our democracy, militarise our cities and end elections,” CNN reported.Vice President JD Vance, however, defended the administration’s approach, saying during a visit to Wisconsin, “Chicago has had a lot of crime problems. Why is it that you have mayors and governors who are angrier about Donald Trump offering to help them than they are about the fact that their own residents are being carjacked and murdered in the streets?”","Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order directing city agencies and police to resist US President Donald Trump’s planned federal immigration enforcement surge.

Tribals to be kept out of UCC ambit: Rijiju,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tribals-to-be-kept-out-of-ucc-ambit-rijiju/articleshow/123621976.cms,"NEW DELHI: Union minority affairs minister Kiren Rijiju on Sunday said tribals in the northeast and other parts of the country will be kept out of the ambit of the proposed Uniform Civil Code (UCC), so that they can ""freely"" live their lives as per their social systems.Speaking at the inauguration of Bhagwan Birsa Munda Bhavan - a tribal research and training centre built by RSS-affiliate Akhil Bharatiya Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram -- in Delhi, Rijiju said: ""Some people create a bizarre atmosphere on social media these days and build a narrative against the Centre. Being a Union minister, I want to share the stand of our govt. Our govt and party (BJP) think about (bringing) a Uniform Civil Code in the country as per the Constitution. When criminal law is equal for all, why should civil law also not be (equal for everyone)?""He added that while some states have already started work on UCC, tribals will remain outside its scope. ""We have clearly said that tribals will be exempted from it. Let Adivasis be given the freedom to live in their own way. This (UCC) will not be implemented in Schedule 6, Schedule 5, the northeast and other tribal areas in the country,"" Rijiju said. The issue of a UCC is being examined by the Law Commission. Uttarakhand has already brought it into force. At the event, Rijiju joined Union urban development and energy minister Manohar Lal Khattar and RSS general secretary Dattatreya Hosabale in unveiling a statue of tribal freedom fighter Birsa Munda.Hosabale underlined the importance of tribal culture in shaping India's national identity. He said tribals should not be seen as relics of the past but as a ""living culture"" that enriches the country. ""India's national identity cannot be imagined without the tribal heritage. Development in tribal areas should empower them, not displace them. Tribals must be partners in growth, not bystanders,"" he said, praising the Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram for its decades-long work to protect tribal identity and traditions.Rijiju also reflected on the role of cultural organisations. ""Except for the Sangh family and a few other organisations, no organisation has genuinely tried to connect tribals in this country. It is said that the tribals should come into the mainstream. I don't understand what the mainstream is because Sanatan includes diverse cultures and is united with them all,"" he said.The organisers of the event said the new centre would serve as a hub for research, youth leadership training, and awareness programmes aimed at preserving tribal traditions, coinciding with the 150th birth anniversary of Birsa Munda.",Union minority affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said tribals in the northeast and other parts of the country will be kept out of the ambit of the proposed Uniform Civil Code.

‘U.S. Image Damaged By India Offensive’: Trump Gets Reality Check In Own Nation On Tariff War





Days after a federal appeals court declared most of his tariffs illegal, US President Donald Trump on Sunday, strongly defended his trade policy and thanked an Obama-appointed judge for siding with him in the ruling.In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump said tariffs had brought “TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS” into the US and without them “our Country would be completely destroyed, and our military power would be instantly obliterated.”Trump wrote, “without Tariffs, and all of the TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS we have already taken in, our Country would be completely destroyed, and our military power would be instantly obliterated.”He went on to criticise the court’s majority decision but praised one Democratic-appointed judge for supporting his position.“In a 7 to 4 Opinion, a Radical Left group of judges didn’t care, but one Democrat, Obama appointed, actually voted to save our Country. I would like to thank him for his Courage! He loves and respects the USA,” Trump wrote.The US court of appeals for the federal circuit ruled this week that Trump had overstepped his presidential authority when he imposed wide-ranging “reciprocal tariffs” on nearly every country in April, and declared them unconstitutional, and illegal.The ruling covered two sets of tariffs - Trump’s “reciprocal” duties imposed in April as part of his trade war and another set announced in February against China, Canada and Mexico.The levies were set to cover about 69 percent of US imports but will now only affect around 16 percent unless overturned by the Supreme Court, before October 14, later this year.Despite the setback, parts of Trump’s trade agenda remain intact. Sector-specific duties and some tariffs first introduced in his previous term, were not impacted by the ruling.Most notably, Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs, imposed under Section 232, remain in effect. Recently, the administration broadened their scope, lifting duties to as high as 50% on more than 400 additional product categories, the commerce department said.“Section 232 tariffs are central to President Trump’s tariff strategy. They aren’t the target of the pending litigation, and they’re more likely to survive a legal challenge and continue into the next presidential administration, which is what we saw with the aluminum and steel tariffs originally imposed under the first Trump administration,” Mike Lowell, a partner at law firm Reed Smith, told CNBC.The Trump administration is said to be preparing to broaden its sector-specific tariffs, such as those on steel and aluminum, in an effort to sidestep the ongoing legal challenges, according to The Wall Street Journal.","US President Donald Trump on Sunday, strongly defended his trade policy and thanked an Obama-appointed judge for siding with him in the ruling.

More than 20 people have died after a 6.0-magnitude earthquake struck eastern Afghanistan near the Pakistan border, as reported by BBC. Over 115 injured individuals have been taken to hospitals in Nangarhar and Kunar provinces. The US Geological Survey reported the shallow quake hit late Sunday night, followed by at least three aftershocks.The US geological survey (USGS) reported reported that the quake hit at 11:47 pm local time (1917 GMT) at a shallow depth of 8 km, with its epicenter located 27 km east-northeast of Jalalabad in Nangarhar province.Provincial authorities said the children died when the roof of their home collapsed during the tremors. Initial assessments also reported multiple injuries.The quake shook buildings for several seconds across eastern Afghanistan, with tremors also felt in Pakistan’s capital Islamabad, around 370 km away, AFP journalists said.Afghanistan is highly prone to seismic activity due to its location near the junction of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates, particularly in the Hindu Kush region.The quake comes just days after Nangarhar province was hit by heavy flooding from Friday night into Saturday, which killed five people and destroyed crops and property, local officials said.","6.0-magnitude earthquake strikes eastern Afghanistan near Pakistan border.

Thousands of Australians on Sunday participated in anti-immigration demonstrations nationwide, which the center-left government denounced as being associated with neo-Nazis and intended to incite hatred. According to the group's website, March for Australia marches against immigration took place in Sydney as well as other state capitals and rural hubs.According to the Australian Broadcasting Corp, between 5,000 and 8,000 people had gathered for the event in Sydney, many of them wearing Australian flags. It took place close to the Sydney Marathon track, where 35,000 racers ran through the streets on Sunday before coming to a stop at the Opera House.""Mass migration has torn at the bonds that held our communities together,"" according to the website. The rally's goal, the group wrote on X on Saturday, was to accomplish ""what the mainstream politicians never have the courage to do: demand an end to mass immigration.""In addition, the group claims that it is worried about infrastructure, hospitals, crime, wages, traffic, housing and water supply, culture, and the loss of community.Right-wing extremism, including neo-Nazi protests, has been on the rise in Australia, a country where one in two people was born abroad or has an overseas parent.""We vehemently oppose today's March for Australia demonstration,"" said Murray Watt, a senior minister in the Labor government. When questioned about the protest in Sydney, the nation's most populous city, he told Sky News television that it is not about fostering more social harmony.Watt stated that the demonstrations were ""organized and promoted"" by neo-Nazi organizations. ""We don't support rallies like this that are about spreading hate and that are about dividing our community,"" Watt added. A request for response to the neo-Nazi allegations was not immediately answered by the March for Australia organizers.Following a series of antisemitic attacks on synagogues, buildings, and vehicles since Israel's war in Gaza began in October 2023, laws in Australia this year prohibited the Nazi salute and the sale or display of symbols linked to terrorist organizations.'Disgust and anger' shared by counter protestersA counter-rally organized by the neighborhood activist group Refugee Action Coalition also happened close by.Hundreds attended the event, according to the organizers.

Xi Sends Powerful Message After Trump Tries To Isolate China & India | ‘Right Choice To Be Friends’

What is the SCO and why it matters



Members with different priorities



India at SCO



The bigger picture







Prime Minister Narendra Modi , Russian President Vladimir Putin , and leaders of eight other countries will meet in northern China for the latest summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO).The 10-member grouping, which includes some of Asia’s biggest powers, has grown steadily over the past two decades and is increasingly seen as a platform where countries seek alternatives to US-led approaches on trade, security and regional disputes.The SCO was created in 2001, with China and Russia as its principal drivers, along with four Central Asian states — Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Over time, it has expanded to include India and Pakistan in 2017, Iran in 2023, and Belarus in 2024, bringing the total membership to 10. Together, these countries cover about 40% of the world’s population.The SCO has 10 members: Russia, Belarus, China, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Formed in 2001, the bloc was initially seen as a counter to US influence in Central Asia. India and Pakistan joined in 2017, Iran in 2023 and Belarus in 2024.The bloc includes countries with very different positions on the global stage. Iran and Belarus remain under Western sanctions. Pakistan depends heavily on China for military and economic support. Russia faces growing isolation over its war in Ukraine. India, meanwhile, has taken a more independent stance, engaging with the SCO while maintaining ties with the US and its partners in the Quad.This diversity means the SCO has influence but also internal differences. Its goals are not always clearly defined, which limits its ability to act as a unified bloc.Some members, such as Iran and Belarus, are considered opponents of the West. Others, including India, China and Russia, have mixed relations with the US, shaped by Washington’s policies on the war in Ukraine and trade tariffs affecting Beijing and New Delhi.Since its creation, the SCO has been led mainly by China, the region’s largest economy, while Russia has sought to use it to retain influence over former Soviet republics Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. Russia’s economic role has weakened under Western sanctions, but both Moscow and Beijing continue to use the bloc for regional military cooperation, limited to joint drills and exercises.India’s position within the SCO brings a different dynamic. India has maintained a policy of neutrality, which some see as self-interest. Since the Ukraine war began, India has become a significant buyer of Russian oil, creating friction with Washington. PM Modi recently spoke of ""steady progress"" in ties with China after meeting its foreign minister last week, saying there was ""respect for each other’s interests and sensitiveness. ""India’s presence challenges the dominance of Russia and China in the group. While India has strong trade with both, it is unlikely to support Russia’s actions in Ukraine or China’s claims over Taiwan and the South China Sea.India has also pushed for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council but has received only limited support from China and Russia, which may want to avoid weakening their own leverage with the West.The SCO is one of the most prominent regional organizations China has cofounded, University of Chicago political scientist Dali Yang was quoted as saying by the news agency Associated Press.“For China’s leadership, there is a lot of emphasis on maintaining existing relations in the international arena even though the SCO has not been effective in dealing with the major challenges of today,” Yang said.According to June Teufel Dreyer, a China expert at the University of Miami, the SCO now appears to be moving beyond its earlier role as mainly a dialogue forum. She said the grouping seems to want to become a ""full-fledged mechanism of practical cooperation that brings tangible results to the citizens of the member states."" However, she added, as quoted by AP, the key question is, “to what end and how?”","The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) was created in 2001. The 10-member grouping includes some of Asia’s biggest powers. India and Pakistan joined in 2017, Iran in 2023, and Belarus in 2024.

The three victims, killed when an illegal Indian-origin driver, Harjinder Singh , made a reckless U-turn on a Florida highway earlier this month, were not Americans but Haitian immigrants.According to a report from the Miami Herald, the driver, Herby Dufresne, 30, and passengers Faniola Joseph, 27, and Rodrigue Dor, 53, were all Haitian immigrants who were in the minivan that ploughed into an 18-wheeler truck driven by Singh.The report cited a friend of the victim who claimed that Dufresne arrived in Miami in December 2023 from Port-au-Prince. Later, after obtaining a financial sponsor under the Biden era, he got a two-year permit to live and work in US.However, there is very little information about the other two victims, Joseph and Dor's arrival or immigration. The Miami Herald reported that the two previously lived in Florida.The friend told the outlet that all three victims were travelling to Indiana, where Dor relocated after failing to secure work in Miami.The incident was condemned widely, which showed Singh making a U-turn that led to the horrific accident. Singh, who came to US illegally in 2018, failed English proficiency exams administered by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration after the deadly incident.According to the department of transportation, Singh was only able to read one of the four signs during the test.He was about to be deported in 2018, but was granted a work permit under the Biden administration in 2021. Singh, who is in jail in Florida, received a commercial driver's license in California in 2024 and one in Washington in 2023.","Herby Dufresne, 30, and passengers Faniola Joseph, 27, and Rodrigue Dor, 53, were all Haitian immigrants who were in the minivan that ploughed into an 18-wheeler truck driven by Harjinder Singh.

NEW DELHI: A birthday celebration in northwest Delhi’s KN Katju Marg turned into tragedy after a quarrel over gifts escalated into a double murder, police said.According to investigators, Priya Sehgal (34) allegedly made an uncharitable remark about her husband’s family not bringing gifts during their younger son’s 15th birthday celebrations.Enraged, her husband Yogesh Sehgal attacked her with a pair of scissors, stabbing her in the neck, before turning on his mother-in-law Kusum Sinha (63).Both women died on the spot.The killings came to light when Priya’s brother, Megh Sinha, reached her Rohini flat and found the house in disarray.“When I lifted my mother, I noticed deep injuries on her throat and abdomen, with blood flowing from the wounds,” he told reporters.Megh later learnt that Yogesh had gone to the police station, accusing his wife and mother-in-law of assaulting him.Police said Yogesh attempted to clean the scene, locked the flat, and waited for his sons to return from school. He later roamed around with them until he was arrested in Rohini.Investigators added that the couple’s frequent domestic disputes had worsened in recent months, and the birthday-related remark appeared to have triggered the fatal violence.Brother of Priya, told PTI, ""My mother had gone to my sister's house a day before and told us she would return the next day. When we called her in between, she said there was a fight going on between my sister and her husband, and that she would help sort it out and then come back. But she never returned. We kept calling her the next morning around 11,00 am, 11.30 am and again at 12, but neither she nor my sister picked up. We thought maybe they were asleep. By afternoon, we decided to go and check. When we reached the house and knocked, we saw blood stains on the lock.""He said that when they went in, they found his mother and sister lying soaked in blood.""We went to their house around 3.30 pm. My brother-in-law had killed them and fled with the children. Who does this? Everybody has fights in a marriage, they have been married for 17 years. But who kills their wife and mother-in-law like this? It is so inhuman,"" he said.","Priya Sehgal, 34, allegedly made an uncharitable remark about her husband's family not bringing gifts during their younger son's 15th birthday celebrations.

He’s got a girlfriend that is half his age, who is apparently is both a country music singer, a political commentator on Rumble, a friend of John Rich through Bongino, who also now owns a big chunk of Rumble, and she’s also a former Mossad agent in what is like the equivalent of their NSA. But I’m sure that’s totally because, like, she’s really looking for like a cross-eyed, you know, kind of thickish built, super cool bro who’s almost 50 years old who’s Indian in America.

“Definitely not. That is a firm no.”

“I’ve spent my career saying no to anything that would compromise my character and working to restore America.

These accusations are obviously insanely ridiculous and coming from accounts that are farming because their engagement dried up after Trump’s win.

As global leaders gathered in China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, a moment of warmth and familiarity between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping drew attention on the sidelines of the event.The two leaders were seen warmly greeting each other at a photocall, before Xi called in an interpreter for what seemed like a friendly conversation. Their interaction continued as the family members gathered for the family photo, underscoring the close personal rapport they share.Putin arrived in Tianjin on Sunday with a high-level delegation that included foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, Deputy Prime Minister Alexey Overchuk, Kremlin Aide Yury Ushakov and Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov, among others, according to Russian news agency Tass.The Russian leader was greeted with a classic Russian folk song Kalinka upon his arrival in the summit, as reported by RT news agency.The ceremony was held at the Tianjin Meijiang International Convention and Exhibition Center, where Xi delivered an address before hosting the guests for a concert.The summit in Tianjin, the largest SCO gathering since the bloc was founded in 2001, highlights Beijing’s push for stronger multilateral platforms as an alternative to Western-led alliances such as Nato.Putin, in an interview with Chinese state media ahead of his trip, described the China-Russia partnership as a “stabilizing force” for the world, adding that both nations were “united in our vision of building a just, multipolar world order.”The Russian leader is expected to stay on in China for a military parade in Beijing on Wednesday to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, which China commemorates as the war of resistance against Japanese aggression. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is also expected to attend.On the sidelines of the SCO, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held separate meetings with both Xi and Putin. In his conversation with Xi, PM Modi said India was committed to advancing bilateral ties on the basis of “mutual trust, dignity and sensitivity.” Xi, in turn, stressed that China and India should view each other as “partners rather than rivals.”","Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping met on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit.

‘Digital tokens’ to tourist resorts: What is US planning for post-war Gaza? Report claims 2 million Palestinians to relocate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/digital-tokens-to-tourist-resorts-what-is-us-planning-for-post-war-gaza-report-claims-2-million-palestinians-to-relocate/articleshow/123625125.cms,"AP file photo

The proposed plan







US President Donald Trump’s administration is considering a post-war Gaza plan under which the US would oversee the enclave for at least a decade, relocate its residents, and redevelop the area into a tourist destination and manufacturing hub, the Washington Post reported on Sunday.The proposal is named the “Gaza Reconstitution, Economic Acceleration, and Transformation Trust (GREAT Trust) and was drafted by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).The GHF works with the Israeli forces and private US security and logistics firms to deliver food into the beseiged Gaza Strip. GHF is backed by both the Trump administration and Israel and is preferred over the UN-led system that Israel claims allows militants to divert supplies, as per Reuters.As per a 38-page prospectus, Gaza’s 2 million residents would be required to leave temporarily, either through “voluntary” relocation abroad or by moving into designated restricted zones within the territory during reconstruction, reported the Post.The landowners would reportedly receive “digital tokens” granting rights to redevelop their property, while Palestinians who left would be given $5,000 in cash, rent subsidies for four years, and food support for one year.The report noted that financial planning for the project was handled by a team from the Boston Consulting Group.Under the administration’s vision, Gaza would be redeveloped into a tourist resort as well as a hub for high-tech manufacturing and technology. Two sources who are familiar with the planning said that the key aspects of the proposal were curated to realize Trump’s vision of a “Rivera of the Middle East.”Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff expressed confidence that the war in Gaza could be resolved in four months.""We're going to settle this one way or another, certainly before the end of this year,"" he said in an interview with Fox News last week.When asked about a “post-war plan” in the war-battered Gaza Strip, Witkoff said, ""It's a very comprehensive plan we're putting together on the next day that I think many people are going to... see how robust it is and how it's how well meaning it is, and it reflects President Trump's humanitarian motives here.""A proposal to establish large-scale camps, called ""Humanitarian Transit Areas,"" within Gaza, and potentially outside, to accommodate the Palestinian population, was previously reported on by Reuters.No Arab state has so far agreed to take part in governing Gaza after the war. The Israeli army says it currently controls roughly 75 percent of Gaza, though most of the territory’s 2 million residents have been displaced repeatedly over the past 22 months.Meanwhile, in the West Bank, the Israeli government has approved 3,400 settlement homes in a project that finance minister Bezalel Smotrich, a hard-line coalition partner, described as proof that the “idea of a Palestinian state is being erased from the table.”","US President Donald Trump’s administration is considering a post-war Gaza plan under which the US would oversee the enclave for at least a decade.

Haunting Yearbook Photo Emerges of Minnesota Mass Shooter Robin Westman Living as a Woman





Weeks before a gunman opened fire at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis, killing two children and injuring 18 others, the Trump administration cut funding for a Minnesota program intended to prevent acts of mass violence, according to documents cited by the New York Times.In July, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced $18.5 million in spending cuts from the Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships (CP3).About $700,000 of that funding had been allocated to the Minnesota Department of Public Safety (DPS) for roles aimed at preventing targeted violence and terrorism.DPS Commissioner Bob Jacobson wrote to the state’s congressional delegation at the time that “without this funding, our capacity to protect our communities from targeted violence and terrorism will be significantly diminished.”DPS spokesperson Jill Oliveira was quoted as saying by the New York Times that since the cuts, the agency had cancelled a statewide training conference and redirected resources to cover costs.Previous CP3 funding, she said, supported training for law enforcement, schools, and faith institutions in threat prevention.The Trump administration argued the program was misused. In its letter to Minnesota authorities, DHS said CP3 grants were “no longer in line” with its priorities, citing immigration enforcement, border security and combating antisemitism.A Homeland Security official said in a statement that CP3 had been used for “left-wing ideologies and did next to nothing to combat actual threats.” The official also said that many grants had gone to groups that “celebrated and encouraged transgenderism in children,” a remark that drew criticism from Democrats.The cuts also impacted the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office, which had received about $100,000 for multidisciplinary threat-assessment work, according to CNN. A former DHS employee told the outlet the Minneapolis attack was “100% preventable. This was exactly the kind of event we could have stopped.”The assailant, Robin Westman, left behind journals expressing surprise at evading detection. “Should be harder for people like me to carry out these attacks,” he wrote, as reported by CNN.In one journal entry, he wrote, “I have been showing signs for a while. I need to be stopped! … If I did something, they would say it was obvious in hindsight.”Jacob Ware, a research fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, was quoted as saying by CNN that “the capacity to combat domestic terrorism is eroding. It seems like the focus on prevention has slipped in this country.”Minnesota lawmakers criticised the decision. Sen. Tina Smith said, “This shooting was horrific, and to think we had a strategy in place aimed at preventing this type of violence is tragic.”Rep. Betty McCollum added that cancelling the grant “limits our state law enforcement from access to vital federal counterterrorism partners and resources and leaves Minnesota communities more vulnerable.”The attack followed an earlier June assassination plot that killed a state representative and her husband and wounded a senator and his wife, events that further fuel concerns about weakened prevention efforts.After the shooting, US First Lady Melania Trump urged more proactive measures, posting on X, “To prevent future tragedies, it is crucial we look into behavioural threat assessments across all levels of society … Being aware of these warning signs and acting quickly can save lives and make American communities safer.”","In July, the Department of Homeland Security announced $18.5 million in spending cuts from the Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships (CP3) About $700,000 of that funding had been allocated to the Minnesota Department of Public Safety for roles aimed at preventing targeted violence and terrorism.

Trump’s health drama: Mystery bruise and swollen ankles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-health-drama-mystery-bruise-and-swollen-ankles-what-the-white-house-isnt-saying/articleshow/123608297.cms,"Trump’s Health Mystery DEEPENS: President Hides Massive Bruise From Public Eyes

The bruise that wouldn’t fade

Makeup, cameras, and awkward excuses

The ankle twist

Experts weigh in





A bruise on the hand of a 79-year-old man wouldn’t normally make headlines, unless that man is Donald Trump, the president who campaigned in 2024 on being sharper, stronger, and healthier than Joe Biden What began as a curious blotch on his hand has spiraled into months of speculation, with the White House offering shifting explanations that have only deepened doubts about Trump’s health.The saga began on February 24, 2025, when a Getty photographer snapped Trump greeting French President Emmanuel Macron.The close-up revealed a dark bruise smeared with makeup, clumsily concealed but unmistakable.Observers soon realized the mark had been visible as far back as spring 2024, when Trump himself dismissed it as the byproduct of “overzealous handshakes.”“A woman gripped my hand so hard, the Secret Service had to step in,” Trump told the Washington Examiner in 2024. He repeated the story to Time magazine later that year.But as the bruise lingered into 2025, the explanation began to unravel.By summer, Trump was regularly spotted with mismatched concealer caked on his hand.A C-SPAN cameraman zoomed in on the blotchy makeup during a July press event, sparking fresh scrutiny.The White House doubled down, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt calling the bruise nothing more than “soft tissue irritation” from endless handshakes and daily aspirin.Then came the curveball. At the FIFA Club World Cup Final in New Jersey on July 13, Trump was photographed with swollen ankles. Days later, the White House abandoned the handshake defense and admitted the president had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), a vascular condition common in older adults that hampers blood flow from the legs to the heart.Trump’s doctor, Sean Barbabella, assured reporters there was “no evidence of heart failure or serious illness.” But crucial details about treatment remain undisclosed, with Leavitt insisting, “You see the president every day, he’s working, he’s moving, he’s continuing.”Not everyone is convinced the story adds up. Dr Peter Henke, a former chair of the American Heart Association’s vascular council, told New York Magazine that the bruising on Trump’s hand is “unrelated to venous insufficiency.” Instead, Henke suggested, aspirin use could explain the unusual bruising.The White House has not allowed Dr Barbabella to face questions directly, despite earlier promising transparency.","Donald Trump, 79, was photographed with a bruise on his hand in February 2025.

‘Use paper ballots only’: Donald Trump vows executive order on voter ID; seeks mail-in voting only for ill and military,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/use-paper-ballots-only-donald-trump-vows-executive-order-on-voter-id-seeks-mail-in-voting-only-for-ill-and-military/articleshow/123610120.cms,"File photo: US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)





US President Donald Trump announced plans on late Saturday to issue an executive order that would make voter identification mandatory and restrict mail-in voting.“Voter ID must be part of every single vote. No exceptions! I will be doing an executive order to that end!!!” Trump wrote on Truth Social.He added, “Also, No Mail-In Voting, except for those that are very ill, and the far away military. Use paper ballots only!!!”.The post builds on Trump’s repeated pledges to overhaul US voting systems. A few days ago, he said the order was being prepared “by the best lawyers in the country” to eliminate mail-in ballots, reported The New York Times.Trump argued that Republicans needed to “get tough and stop it” because, in his view, Democrats benefited disproportionately from the practice.Mail-in and absentee voting accounted for just over 30 per cent of ballots in the 2024 elections, according to news agency AFP. Although Trump and his allies have repeatedly claimed the system is open to fraud, experts and officials have stressed there is no evidence postal voting is less secure than in-person voting.Pro-democracy groups have also warned that scrapping it could disenfranchise millions of Americans, particularly those with disabilities or other barriers to reaching polling places.Constitutionally, the president does not have the authority to unilaterally change election rules. The power to regulate the “times, places and manner” of elections lies with state legislatures, and only Congress can override those laws. As The New York Times noted, any executive order targeting mail-in ballots or voting procedures would face immediate legal challenges.Trump has previously relied on absentee voting himself, including during Florida’s 2020 primaries. His critics argue the push to end mail-in voting is politically motivated, pointing out that Democrats have historically outnumbered Republicans in using postal ballots.","US President Donald Trump announced plans on late Saturday to issue an executive order that would make voter ID mandatory and restrict mail-in voting.

White House planning rebranding of defence dept: Reports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/white-house-planning-rebranding-of-defence-dept-reports/articleshow/123624281.cms,"(Taken from Reuters)





WASHINGTON: The Trump administration is advancing plans to rename the department of defence as the department of war, the Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday, citing a White House official, after President Donald Trump raised the prospect on Monday. Restoring the department of war name for the govt’s largest department would likely require congressional action, but the White House is exploring alternative methods to implement the change, the report said.Republican Representative Greg Steube of Florida filed an amendment to the annual defence policy bill that would change the name of the department, indicating some Republican support in Congress for the change.The White House gave no details. “As President Trump said, our military should be focused on offence – not just defence – which is why he has prioritized warfighters at the Pentagon instead of DEI and woke ideology. Stay tuned!” said White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly.Trump raised the idea of rebranding while speaking with reporters in the Oval Office on Monday, saying it “just sounded to me better.” “It used to be called the department of war and it had a stronger sound,” Trump said.The war department became the department of defence through a gradual process, beginning with the National Security Act of 1947, which unified the Army, Navy, and Air Force under a single organization called the National Military Establishment. An amendment to the law passed in 1949 officially introduced the name “department of defence.”","Wall Street Journal: Trump administration advancing plans to rename department of defence as department of war.

WASHINGTON: The 22-year-old philosophy student from China did not expect any problems after his 29-hour flight arrived at a Texas airport this month as he was on his way to study at the University of Houston.His paperwork was in order. He was going to study humanities - not a tech field that might raise suspicions. He had a full scholarship from a US school and had previously spent a semester at Cornell University for an exchange program with no issues.But the student, who asked to be identified only by his family name, Gu, because of the political sensitivities of the matter, was stopped, interrogated and 36 hours later, put on a plane back to China. He was also banned from coming back for five years, abruptly halting his dream for an academic career in the US. ""There is no opportunity for the life I had expected,"" Gu said.He is one of an unknown number of Chinese students with permission to enter the US who have been sent back to China or faced intense questioning after their arrival, drawing strong protests from Beijing and showing the uncertainty from President Donald Trump's shifting policies.His administration has quickly pivoted from a plan to revoke visas for Chinese students to Trump himself saying he would welcome hundreds of thousands of them, partly to help keep some American schools afloat. The US has put restrictions on Chinese students.Even so, some officials and lawmakers have expressed suspicions about Chinese students, especially those who study advanced technologies and their possible links to the Chinese govt and military. Some lawmakers want to ban Chinese students altogether.The Chinese embassy said it has received reports involving more than 10 Chinese students and scholars being interrogated, harassed and repatriated when entering the US. ""The US side has frequently carried out discriminatory, politically driven and selective law enforcement against Chinese students and scholars, inflicting physical and mental harm,"" the Chinese Embassy said.","An unknown number of Chinese students with permission to enter the US have been sent back to China.

President Donald Trump said late Saturday that he would issue an executive order to require voter identification for all US elections, a continuation of his efforts to overhaul the nation's election laws, which he has long attacked and falsely blamed for his 2020 election loss.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said, ""Voter ID Must Be Part of Every Single Vote. NO EXCEPTIONS! I Will Be Doing An Executive Order To That End!!!"" He did not provide further details about the order. He also reiterated his intention to restrict mail-in voting except for those who are very ill or in the military serving far away, as well as his opposition to voting machines.The announcement signals Trump's latest effort to influence election laws using an executive order, something that he has dubious authority to do. The Constitution gives the president no explicit authority to regulate elections. Rather, it gives states the power to decide the rules of elections, oversee voting and try to prevent fraud. It gives Congress the ability to override state laws on voting. Any executive order from the president regarding elections is likely to see legal challenges.",President Donald Trump says he will issue an executive order to require voter ID for all US elections.

‘We haven't taken anything off the table’: Kristi Noem signals expanding ICE ops; Chicago next in line after Los Angeles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/we-havent-taken-anything-off-the-table-kristi-noem-signals-expanding-ice-ops-chicago-next-in-line-after-los-angeles/articleshow/123622495.cms,"Kristi Neom (File - AP)





Homeland security secretary Kristi Noem said Sunday that the Trump administration is considering expanding immigration enforcement operations to more US cities.""We haven't taken anything off the table,"" Noem said on CBS News’ Face the Nation when asked about the possibility of widening immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) activities.""I think there's a lot of cities that are dealing with crime and violence right now. And so, we haven't taken anything off the table. We've been making sure that we have the resources and the equipment to go in.""According to CBS News, ICE is planning to expand its operations to Chicago in the coming days, mirroring immigration arrest drives earlier this year in Los Angeles.Noem confirmed there have been ""ongoing operations with ICE in Chicago and throughout Illinois and other states,"" and added, ""we do intend to add more resources to those operations.""While she declined to share details for security reasons, Noem stressed: ""We will continue to go after the worst of the worst across the country, like President Trump has told us to do.""The Trump administration has recently intensified its focus on cities with ""sanctuary"" policies, filing lawsuits against jurisdictions that limit cooperation with federal immigration agents. The White House has also linked immigration enforcement to its broader push to reduce violent crime in major cities.Earlier this month, Trump federalized Washington DC’s metropolitan police department and deployed the national guard there. A similar deployment in Los Angeles in June had sparked a legal challenge from California’s Democratic governor.On the question of whether the national guard could also be used in Chicago, Noem said the decision rests solely with the President. CBS News reported that current immigration enforcement plans are separate from Trump’s threat to deploy the Guard to Chicago to tackle crime.Illinois Governor JB Pritzker criticised the administration’s approach, calling it “dangerous” and “un-American.”""We have people that have lived, yes in the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago for decades, working here, paying taxes,"" Pritzker said. ""They're law abiding members of our communities, friends, neighbors, and why are we arresting them? Why are we making them disappear?""Pritzker argued that federal operations without local coordination could “cause enormous problems.” Noem countered that even “one murder” should be reason enough for the governor to seek the President’s help.Encouraging other mayors and governors to work with the White House, Noem said, ""I'd encourage every single big city, San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, whatever they are, if they want to help make their city safer, more prosperous… they should call us.""She also clarified that enforcement would not be limited to Democrat-run cities. ""Every single city is evaluated for what we need to do there to make it safer,"" Noem said. ""We absolutely are not looking through the viewpoint at anything we're doing with a political lens.","Homeland security secretary Kristi Noem said Sunday that the Trump administration is considering expanding immigration enforcement operations to more US cities.
