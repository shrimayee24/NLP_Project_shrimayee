South Africa Land Confiscation: Trump Cuts Funding Over Human Rights Concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/south-africa-is-confiscating-land-treating-people-very-badly-donald-trump-announces-halt-on-us-funding/articleshow/117871498.cms,"File photo: US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)

US President Donald Trump announced on Sunday that he would cut off all future funding to South Africa, citing allegations that the government was confiscating land and treating certain classes of people “very badly”.Trump made the announcement in a Truth Social post, stating, “South Africa is confiscating land, and treating certain classes of people very badly. The United States won’t stand for it, we will act. Also, I will be cutting off all future funding to South Africa until a full investigation of this situation has been completed!”.According to US government statistics, the United States allocated nearly $440 million in assistance to South Africa in 2023, covering health programs, economic development, and security cooperation, as per the news agency Reuters.Trump’s decision means future funding will be suspended while his administration looks into alleged human rights violations.The controversy stems from South African President Cyril Ramaphosa ’s recent signing of a land expropriation bill, which allows the government to offer “nil compensation” for property in cases where expropriation is deemed in the public interest.However, the South African government insists that this does not equate to arbitrary seizures and that it will negotiate with landowners first, as per AFP.While land reform remains a sensitive issue in post-apartheid South Africa, critics, including billionaire Elon Musk, a Trump ally and South African-born entrepreneur, have warned that the policy could resemble Zimbabwe’s land seizures of the 1980s, which led to economic collapse.Despite Trump’s move, Ramaphosa has dismissed concerns over relations with Washington. In January, he stated that he had spoken to Trump after his election victory and looked forward to working with his administration.However, the South African government has not yet formally responded to the funding freeze.Trump had previously pledged to investigate alleged violent land takeovers and killings of white farmers in South Africa during his first term, though no evidence of large-scale incidents was found, according to Reuters.The funding cut comes amid Trump’s broader “America First” foreign policy, which has seen him reduce aid to several nations and focus on domestic priorities.","US President Donald Trump announced on Sunday that he would cut off all future funding to South Africa.

'Shows Weak...': Rahul Gandhi Roasts PM Modi Over 'Trump Invite'; Jaishankar Rebuts | Watch

NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha witnessed high political drama as Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched a scathing attack on the ruling BJP, taking jabs at its narratives, budget, and foreign policy.From questioning the government's reluctance to acknowledge Jawaharlal Nehru’s legacy to mocking the absence of photos from the Halwa ceremony and alleging that India sought an invitation for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Donald Trump’s inauguration, Gandhi’s remarks triggered sharp rebuttals from the treasury benches, setting off a heated debate in Parliament.In a fiery speech in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi took direct aim at the ruling BJP, accusing it of selectively invoking historical figures while sidelining India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru.""You talk about Sardar Patel ji, but you destroy his values every day. You talk about Ambedkar ji, but you destroy his values every day. You talk about Nehruji... No, you don’t talk about Nehru ji,"" Gandhi said, correcting himself mid-sentence and emphasizing his point.His remark, made in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, underscored a long-standing critique that the BJP often neglects Nehru’s contributions while in India's historical discourse. Congress leaders have frequently accused the ruling party of distorting history.Gandhi also took a dig at the Centre over the conspicuous absence of photographs from the customary Halwa ceremony preceding this year’s Union Budget. The Congress leader had previously raised concerns about representation at the event, claiming last year that he ""didn’t see one OBC, tribal, or Dalit officer"" present.""Before this year’s budget, there was no photograph. I was appalled that they served the Halwa but didn’t show whom it was served to,"" Gandhi remarked sarcastically.""Halwa khilaya magar dikhaya nahi kisko khilaya (They distributed Halwa but didn’t show to whom it was served),"" he added, drawing laughter and jeers from respective sides of the House.Gandhi linked this to his push for a caste census, citing a recent survey conducted in Telangana that, according to him, revealed “shocking” disparities.“Almost 90% of Telangana’s population comprises Dalits, Adivasis, backwards, or minorities. I am convinced this is the case across the country. The OBC population of this country is not even one less than 55%,” he said, reinforcing Congress’ demand for nationwide caste-based data.Gandhi also launched a broadside against India’s diplomatic approach, alleging that the government was positioning India as a subordinate power rather than a global leader.“When we talk to the United States, we should not be sending our foreign minister to invite our Prime Minister to their coronation,” he said, in a pointed reference to Foreign Minister S Jaishankar’s visit to the US ahead of Donald Trump’s first swearing-in ceremony in 2017.His comments sparked an uproar in the House, with Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju immediately countering the claim.“The Leader of Opposition cannot make such serious unsubstantial statements. This is related to the relationship between two countries, and he is making an unverified statement about the Prime Minister’s invitation,” Rijiju said.Speaker Om Birla intervened, asking Gandhi to either provide evidence or withdraw the claim. The Congress leader, however, chose to respond with a characteristic jibe.“I apologize for disturbing your peace of mind…” he said, drawing mixed reactions from the treasury benches and opposition ranks.Later in the day, external affairs minister S Jaishankar rejected the allegations, stating that the PM does not attend such events, and is instead represented by a special envoy.""Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi deliberately spoke a falsehood about my visit to the US in December 2024. I went to meet the Secretary of State and NSA of the Biden Administration. Also to chair a gathering of our Consuls General. During my stay, the incoming NSA-designate met with me,"" Jaishankar said in a post on X.Jaishankar further said that, ""Rahul Gandhi's lies may be intended politically.

Criticism of USAID

Elon Musk's Involvement

The ""War on USAID"" and Public Discourse

Mike Benz , a former State Department official during the Trump administration , has emerged as a key figure in the escalating discourse surrounding government agencies, particularly the U.S. Agency for International Development ( USAID ). Known for his work in cybersecurity and internet policy, Benz has transitioned from government service to becoming a vocal critic of what he perceives as governmental overreach, focusing on issues related to internet censorship , free speech , and foreign policy influence.Benz's post-government career has been marked by high-profile media appearances and a significant presence on social platforms, particularly X, where his critiques have caught the attention of tech billionaire Elon Musk . Their mutual interests in digital freedom and government accountability have aligned Benz with Musk, fueling what some are calling the ""Trump-Musk war on USAID.""Benz has been outspoken about USAID, alleging that the agency operates beyond its traditional humanitarian aid mission. According to Benz, USAID engages in activities that influence foreign policy and may even play a role in online discourse management, raising concerns about political agendas masquerading as development work. His critiques suggest that the agency has evolved into a tool for advancing specific geopolitical objectives, rather than focusing solely on humanitarian efforts.Benz describes USAID as the central entity within what he calls the ""trifecta of foreign policy establishments,"" alongside the State Department, the Department of Defense (DOD), and the intelligence community. In his view, these agencies manage the affairs of what he refers to as the ""American empire,"" with USAID playing a pivotal role in coordinating activities that span beyond humanitarian assistance. ""USAID isn’t just about aid,” Benz claims. “It’s about capacity building and influencing the course of events in foreign nations, often aligned with U.S. strategic interests.""He argues that USAID was established in the 1960s to streamline operations that had previously caused friction among the Pentagon, State Department, and CIA. Prior to USAID's creation under President John F. Kennedy, these agencies often overlapped in their international development efforts, leading to inefficiencies in the execution of U.S. foreign policy. Benz contends that while USAID was designed to resolve these issues, it has since grown into an influential body capable of shaping political and social dynamics in other countries under the guise of development aid.Elon Musk has amplified Benz's critiques, frequently engaging with his content on X and voicing his own concerns about USAID's role. Musk has publicly referred to USAID as a ""criminal organization"" and called for its dissolution, aligning with broader efforts under former President Trump’s second term to restructure or dismantle government agencies seen as inefficient or politically biased.Reports from early 2025 suggest that Musk’s influence extends beyond rhetoric. Through his involvement with the newly formed ""Department of Government Efficiency"" (DOGE), Musk has reportedly played a role in advocating for reforms targeting USAID. This includes the removal of key security officials within the agency, perceived as barriers to the Trump administration's reform agenda.The so-called ""Trump-Musk war on USAID"" reflects a broader political movement aimed at redefining the role of U.S. government institutions. Benz’s media appearances, including interviews with figures like Joe Rogan, have further propelled his viewpoints into mainstream discourse. His critiques resonate particularly within conservative circles, where concerns about government overreach and lack of transparency are prominent.However, Benz's background is not without controversy. Reports have linked him to alt-right circles, with allegations that he operated under pseudonyms such as ""Frame Game"" to promote conspiracy theories with racist undertones.

We’ll be ripping up the province’s contract with Starlink. Ontario won’t do business with people hellbent on destroying our economy. Canada didn't start this fight with the U.S., but you better believe we're ready to win it,"" the Ontario premier wrote on X.Earlier, Ford announced that his officials would soon be removing American products from provincial liquor store shelves.His statement came a day after British Columbia Premier David Eby announced that the local authority will stop buying liquor from US Republican states.Canada's move is in retaliation to Trump's sweeping new tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China, a move that has triggered sharp reactions from global leaders and financial markets.The tariffs, which Trump says are aimed at protecting American workers and industries, have sparked fears of economic retaliation from affected countries.Meanwhile, Trump said that he would talk to Trudeau at 3.00 PM about drug pouring through the borders of Canada.""Canada doesn’t even allow U.S. Banks to open or do business there. What’s that all about? Many such things, but it’s also a DRUG WAR, and hundreds of thousands of people have died in the U.S. from drugs pouring through the Borders of Mexico and Canada. Just spoke to Justin Trudeau.

Driving the news

This suspension offers a temporary reprieve following a tense period that brought North America to the brink of a trade war.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a 30-day pause on retaliatory tariffs after a phone call with Trump.

Why it matters

This episode underscores Trump’s strategy of using tariff threats as a bargaining tool to extract policy concessions from foreign leaders. His ability to secure border security commitments from both Canada and Mexico suggests that his aggressive trade tactics are still effective.

For Trudeau, the situation is more politically delicate. While his administration portrayed the agreement as part of an existing plan, critics pointed out that Canada had already announced a similar border initiative in December.

Meanwhile, opposition voices in Canada argued that Trudeau gave in too easily to Trump’s demands, reinforcing the perception that the US holds all the leverage in trade disputes.

In Mexico, Sheinbaum’s decision to deploy troops at the border was widely seen as a necessary move to avoid economic hardship. With Mexico deeply reliant on US trade, the risk of tariffs posed a direct threat to its economy.

The big picture

Trump had initially announced new tariffs on Canada over the weekend, citing concerns over illegal immigration and fentanyl trafficking.

Canada responded by announcing its own set of retaliatory levies on US goods, raising the specter of a full-scale trade war.

Similar tariffs were planned for Mexico, but Sheinbaum quickly agreed to send additional troops to the border, prompting Trump to suspend the tariffs there as well.

China, however, remains in Trump’s crosshairs, with new tariffs set to take effect despite Beijing’s objections.

The move sent shockwaves through financial markets. The Canadian dollar initially dropped to a two-decade low before recovering slightly after the tariff pause was announced. US stock index futures, which had slumped on fears of a trade war, also rebounded.

What Trump wants from trade tariffs | Economist explains

What they are saying

Trudeau and Trump both took to social media to announce the agreement.

Trudeau on X : “I just had a good call with President Trump. Canada is implementing our $1.3 billion border plan—reinforcing the border with new choppers, technology, personnel, and enhanced coordination with our American partners. Nearly 10,000 frontline personnel are and will be working on protecting the border.”

“This is victory. There were a lot of doubters out there who seemed to forget we are the world’s biggest economy.” Despite Trump’s triumphal tone, Canadians were less enthusiastic. Opposition politicians accused Trudeau of caving to pressure, while many pointed out that the border measures he announced were already part of a previously planned initiative.

Between the lines

Trump’s tariff strategy is not new. He has consistently used economic pressure to force other nations to meet his demands.

In 2019, he threatened tariffs on Mexico to push its government into cracking down on illegal border crossings.

He has long criticized Nato allies for not spending enough on defense, often tying economic consequences to military obligations.

His latest tariffs on China reflect his ongoing stance that Beijing is engaged in “unfair trade practices.”

For Canada, the situation is more complex. While the country is a key US ally, it has found itself in Trump’s crosshairs before. His threats of tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum in 2018 led to months of tense negotiations before an agreement was reached.

This time, Trudeau appeared eager to de-escalate the situation quickly, knowing that Canada’s economy is heavily reliant on trade with the US.

Trump imposes tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China

Zoom in: The political impact

Trudeau faces significant domestic fallout from this deal. His opponents argue that he effectively rewarded Trump’s aggressive tactics by agreeing to border measures that Canada was already planning. Some fear this sets a precedent where Canada will always be forced to make concessions under US pressure.

Trump, on the other hand, can claim a political victory. By extracting border security commitments from both Canada and Mexico, he can argue that his tariff threats are effective in strengthening US security.

For China, the situation remains tense. Unlike Canada and Mexico, Beijing has shown no willingness to back down. If Trump escalates tariffs further, it could lead to a prolonged trade conflict with global economic consequences.

What’s next

The 30-day tariff pause gives Canada and Mexico breathing room, but Trump has made it clear that he expects continued cooperation on border security. If he feels progress is lacking, the tariffs could be reinstated.

The White House has hinted that Europe may be the next target, with Trump suggesting that the European Union is also engaging in unfair trade practices.

Meanwhile, tariffs on China remain firmly in place, and Trump has warned that they could increase further if Beijing does not curb fentanyl shipments to the US.

Final thoughts

President Donald Trump on Monday agreed to a 30-day suspension of his tariff threats against Mexico and Canada as the United States' two largest trading partners took measures to address his concerns regarding border security and drug trafficking.Trump’s use of tariffs as a tool for economic and security policy is a hallmark of his leadership. By forcing Canada and Mexico to make concessions, he has demonstrated that his approach can yield results. However, the long-term impact on diplomatic relations remains to be seen.For now, the immediate threat of a North American trade war has been averted—but the next 30 days will be critical in determining whether this was a temporary reprieve or just the beginning of a larger economic showdown.(With inputs from agencies)","Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a 30-day pause on retaliatory tariffs after a phone call with Trump.

(Agencies)

A lawsuit was filed on Monday against the University of California, US, accusing the public university system of racial discrimination in its admissions process. The complaint, submitted in a federal district court in California, claims that the university gives unfair preference to Black and Hispanic applicants, violating antidiscrimination laws.The lawsuit was brought by Students Against Racial Discrimination , a group representing White and Asian students who argue that the admissions process should not consider race. The group wants the university to change its policies to comply with federal antidiscrimination laws, the 14th Amendment , and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits racial discrimination by institutions receiving federal funding. If successful, the lawsuit would prevent the university from considering or asking about an applicant’s race during admissions.In response, the University of California said that racial and ethnic data collected in undergraduate applications is ""for statistical purposes only and they are not used for admission."" The university also said it has adjusted its admissions policies to follow Proposition 209, which bans affirmative action in California.This lawsuit follows the US Supreme Court’s June 2023 decision that struck down affirmative action in college admissions at Harvard University and the University of North Carolina. It also comes at a time when some companies are reducing diversity initiatives , which have been criticized by US President Donald Trump and other conservative leaders.Students Against Racial Discrimination, founded in 2024, said that its goal is to ""restore meritocracy in academia"" and oppose admissions policies that prioritize diversity over academic qualifications.The lawsuit claims that the University of California uses a ""holistic"" admissions approach, similar to a system first implemented at UCLA, to reduce differences in admission rates between Black, Hispanic, and other applicants.Since a state referendum was passed in 1996, the nine University of California schools—including the highly selective UCLA and UC Berkeley—have been prohibited from considering race in admissions decisions.The plaintiffs claim that in the years following the referendum, the University of California system spent hundreds of millions of dollars to strengthen the pathway from high school to college for students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. This effort led to an increase in Black and Hispanic applicants and enrollments.","Students Against Racial Discrimination, founded in 2024, said that its goal is to ""restore meritocracy in academia"" The lawsuit follows the US Supreme Court’s June 2023 decision that struck down affirmative action in college admissions at Harvard University and the University of North Carolina.

Canada’s Trudeau announces 25% counter tariffs on US goods | LIVE

Government-run liquor stores in Canada's British Columbia have initiated removing US-made alcohol brands from Republican-led states in response to new American tariffs on Canadian goods.Meanwhile, two more Canadian provinces are planning to get rid of all American alcohol, reported NY post.According to CBC news, by Sunday afternoon, whisky brands such as Jack Daniel’s were absent from store shelves at BC liquor stores’ Cambie Street location in Vancouver, replaced by signs encouraging customers to ""Buy Canadian Instead.""Outgoing Canadian PM Justin Trudeau called on people to ""choose Canada"" and buy Canadian-made products.In a post on X, Trudeau wrote: ""Now is the time to choose products made right here in Canada. Check the labels. Let’s do our part. Wherever we can, choose Canada.""The move came after a directive from BC premier David Eby, who announced Saturday that the province’s liquor distribution branch would stop purchasing alcohol from US states with Republican governors, as CBC news reported.“We have targeted red states because, quite frankly, Donald Trump doesn’t care about Democrat states,” said Housing minister Ravi Kahlon, chair of the cabinet committee overseeing the province’s tariff response. “We want to make sure that we’re not punishing states that have nothing to do with this.”The decision comes after US President Donald Trump signed executive orders Saturday imposing a 25% tariff on most Canadian imports, with a 10% tariff specifically on Canadian energy products.In his order, Trump referenced British Columbia’s role in the “heightened domestic production of fentanyl,” tying it to his justification for the tariffs, alongside concerns about illegal border crossings.However, Kahlon dismissed this claim, instead pointing to a post from Trump’s X account where the president suggested Canada should become the ""Cherished 51st State.""Trump wrote on his Truth Social post: ""We pay hundreds of Billions of Dollars to SUBSIDIZE Canada. Why? There is no reason. We don’t need anything they have. We have unlimited Energy, should make our own Cars, and have more Lumber than we can ever use. Without this massive subsidy, Canada ceases to exist as a viable Country. Harsh but true! Therefore, Canada should become our Cherished 51st State.

"Marco Rubio warns Panama over Chinese influence on canal, says will take 'measures necessary' if not followed",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/unacceptable-rubio-warns-panama-over-chinese-influence-on-canal-says-will-take-measures-necessary-if-not-followed/articleshow/117871295.cms,"File photo: US secretary of state Marco Rubio (Picture credit: AP)

Mulino pushes back, says sovereignty “not in question”

US secretary of state Marco Rubio warned Panama’s President José Raúl Mulino on Sunday to reduce China’s influence over the Canal area or face ""measures necessary"" to protect its rights of Americans under the treaty.Rubio’s message, delivered during his first foreign trip as secretary of state, reflects President Donald Trump’s demand for greater US control over the vital trade waterway.Rubio reportedly told Mulino that China’s growing presence in the canal area could violate the 1977 Panama Canal Treaty, which ensured neutrality and free passage for global trade.According to a state department summary, Rubio made it clear that the current status quo is “unacceptable” and that the US could take “measures necessary” to protect its interests, reported the news agency AFP.Panama took full control of the canal in 1999 under the treaty signed by former US President Jimmy Carter. However, Trump has repeatedly questioned whether the US should reclaim authority over the canal, calling it a strategic asset vital to American security.Despite Rubio’s strong message, Mulino downplayed the threat, saying the talks were “respectful” and “positive”. He insisted that Panama’s sovereignty over the canal remains intact, though he acknowledged US concerns by ordering an audit of the Hong Kong-based company Hutchison Ports , which operates ports on both sides of the canal, according to the news agency AFP.Mulino also confirmed that Panama would not renew its Belt and Road Initiative agreement with China once it expires, signalling a possible shift away from Chinese influence .Rubio’s visit sparked anti-US protests in Panama City, where 200 demonstrators gathered, chanting “Marco Rubio out of Panama” and “One territory, one flag”. Protesters burned an effigy of Rubio, along with a banner featuring Trump’s image. Riot police deployed tear gas to disperse the crowd near the presidential palace.Union leader Saul Mendez slammed the US pressure, saying, “We reiterate that there is absolutely nothing here for Trump. Panama is a free and sovereign nation”, as per AFP.Trump, who has placed China at the centre of his foreign policy agenda, has repeatedly claimed that Chinese investments in Panama’s infrastructure could pose a national security risk. Port facilities at both ends of the canal are controlled by Hutchison Ports, a Hong Kong-based company that was recently granted a 25-year no-bid extension.While Mulino has ruled out US control, some analysts believe Panama may consider a compromise, such as transferring canal operations to an American or European company instead of a Chinese one.However, it remains unclear whether Trump would accept such an alternative.Rubio, who will visit El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala, and the Dominican Republic next, is expected to press Latin American leaders on Trump’s key priority—immigration enforcement.He has also approved waivers for some US foreign aid programs, despite the administration’s freeze on funding for Central America.","US secretary of state Marco Rubio warned Panama to reduce China's influence over the Canal area or face'measures necessary' Panama took full control of the canal in 1999 under the treaty signed by former US President Jimmy Carter.

Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy co-hosted the first-ever X Space on the Department of Government Efficiency last night, dispelling rumors of their apparent clash that prompted Ramaswamy to exit the super-department around the time of President Donald Trump's inauguration. It was rumored that Elon Musk booted Ramaswamy out of the department after his rant against American culture -- becoming the solo head of DOGE as he did not allow Ramaswamy to be on DOGE and to contest for the Ohio governor election at the same time. Ramaswamy, however, asserted that there was no disagreement between him and Elon and he was not fired.

You’ve been kicking a** the last couple of weeks,” Ramaswamy told Musk.The discussion was on DOGE, how the previous government increased mindless expenditure and the announcement that USAID will be shut down. In the end, as Elon Musk thanked everyone for joining the event, he called Vivek Ramaswamy senator and then corrected himself and called him 'Governor'. ""That's the kind of direction we are going in,"" Vivek Ramaswamy replied as both of them laughed.The former presidential candidate and the former co-chief of Doge Vivek Ramaswamy is expected to announce his Ohio Governor bid in mid-February.

The United States late on Monday paused its planned tariffs on Canada and Mexico for 30 days as both countries take measures to address border security and drug trafficking concerns raised by US President Donald Trump. The decision follows negotiations between the leaders of the three countries and agreements on new security measures.Trump announced the temporary suspension, saying, “I am very pleased with this initial outcome, and the Tariffs announced on Saturday will be paused for a 30 day period to see whether or not a final Economic deal with Canada can be structured.

Canada will invest $200 million to support these efforts.Trump also announced a similar 30-day pause on tariffs for Mexico after a conversation with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. Under the agreement, Mexico will deploy 10,000 soldiers to the US-Mexico border to curb fentanyl smuggling and illegal migration while officials continue discussions.Although the tariff suspensions provide temporary relief, the situation remains uncertain.

Trade war averted? Well, for now

FAIRNESS FOR ALL!”Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau confirmed the pause on X, saying that Canada will take several measures, including appointing a fentanyl czar, designating Mexican cartels as terrorist organizations, and launching a joint task force with the US to combat organized crime, fentanyl, and money laundering.Mexico has also reached a similar understanding with the US. The pause allows time for negotiations on drug smuggling and illegal immigration. Meanwhile, the 10 per cent tariff on Chinese imports remains in place, with Trump expected to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping soon.While the immediate risk of a trade war has eased, uncertainty remains. Trump could reintroduce tariffs, and he is also preparing to announce tariffs on imports from the European Union.On Saturday, Trump had directed 25 per cent tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada and a separate 10 per cent tariff on Canadian oil, natural gas, and electricity. Though he had previously indicated these actions, they still surprised investors, businesses, and lawmakers.Analysts suggested that the tariffs could slow economic growth, reduce incomes, and raise prices.

They were referred to as kids as all of them are under 30 with backgrounds in tech, Bloomberg News reported identifying them as Luke Farritor, Edward Coristine, Jeremy Lewin and Gavin Kliger.On Saturday, they requested to enter a highly secure room as they visited several floors and searched desks.

The website of the agency and the social media accounts went dark and thousands of personal services contractors and civil servants lost access to email and SAID systems overnight.“At the direction of Agency leadership, the USAID headquarters at the Ronald Reagan building in Washington, D.C. will be closed to Agency personnel on Monday, February 3, 2025.

PESHAWAR: The Pakistani Taliban claimed the killing of a police officer as he travelled Monday to guard polio vaccinators on the first day of a nationwide immunisation effort after a year of rising cases.The officer was travelling to guard polio vaccinators in the area of Jamrud town in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province when he was killed, local police official Zarmat Khan told AFP.""Two motorcycle riders opened fire on him,"" he said. ""The constable died instantly at the scene."" Pakistan and neighbouring Afghanistan are the only countries where polio is endemic and militants have for decades targeted vaccination teams and their security escorts.The Pakistani Taliban in a statement claimed responsibility for the ""targeted attack"" and said militants also ""seized"" the slain officer's weapon.Pakistan reported at least 73 polio infections in 2024, compared to just six cases in 2023. The vaccination campaign which started on Monday is the first of the year and is due to last a week.""Despite the incident, the polio vaccination drive in the area remains ongoing,"" Khan said.Abdul Hameed Afridi, another senior police official in the area, also confirmed details of the attack and said officers have ""launched an investigation"".Prime minister Shehbaz Sharif acknowledged the violence in a statement from his office, saying ""the anti-polio campaign will continue with full vigour"".Polio can easily be prevented by the oral administration of a few drops of vaccine, but scores of vaccination workers and their escorts have been killed over the years.In the past, clerics falsely claimed that the vaccine contained pork or alcohol, declaring it forbidden for Muslims.In more recent years the attacks have focused on vulnerable police escorts accompanying the vaccinators as they go door-to-door.Last year, dozens of Pakistani policemen who accompany medical teams on campaigns went on strike after a string of militant attacks targeting them.Pakistan has witnessed rising militant attacks since the Taliban returned to power in neighbouring Afghanistan.More than 1,600 people were killed in 2024, the deadliest year in almost a decade, according to the center for research and security studies, an Islamabad-based analysis group.Islamabad accuses Kabul's new rulers of failing to rout militants organising on Afghan soil, a charge the Taliban government routinely denies.In November, at least seven people including five children were killed in a bombing targeting police gathered to guard vaccinators near a school in southwestern Balochistan province.Balochistan, which also neighbours Afghanistan, was the area with the largest number of polio cases in 2024, despite being the most sparsely populated.",The officer was travelling to guard polio vaccinators in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Rich in resources but poverty is rife

Pakistani troops fought insurgents who set up roadblocks in the restive northwestern region of Balochistan, leaving 18 paramilitaries and 23 rebels dead, officials said on Saturday. Three other Pakistani soldiers were seriously wounded in some of the heaviest clashes in recent years.The onslaught was claimed by the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), a militant organization behind rising violence in the Balochistan province that borders Afghanistan and Iran.A vehicle carrying unarmed border troops ""came under gunfire from 70 to 80 armed assailants who had blocked the road,"" a police official told the AFP news agency. The official was speaking on the condition of anonymity.The Pakistani military said the casualties occurred after troops engaged the insurgents who erected barricades on a key highway in Kalat, near the border with Afghanistan.The security forces ""successfully removed the roadblock"" following the overnight clashes, the military said in a statement.The military confirmed 18 soldiers died in the operation and vowed that ""the perpetrators, facilitators and abettors of this heinous and cowardly act, will be brought to justice."" Security forces recovered the bodies of 12 insurgents, the military said.Troops also killed another 11 insurgents in an operation that was still underway, the military added.Pakistan's Balochistan province is currently witnessing a surge in deadly attacks, fueled by demands for independence and control over local resources.A Sunni Muslim ethnic group who live on both sides of the Iran-Pakistan border, and also in parts of southern Afghanistan, over 10,000 Baloch have disappeared since 2011, according to Amnesty International.Efforts for autonomy or independence have been met with violent suppression on both sides of the border. In Pakistan, such efforts are viewed as attempts to fragment the nation — while in Iran the situation is further complicated by the Baloch being a Sunni Muslim minority in a predominantly Shiite country.The largest Baloch militant group, the BLA, is backed by the Pakistani Taliban, also known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).The TTP are a separate group from the BLA, with the TTP being allied with the Afghan Taliban.Balochistan is rich in natural resources such as gold, diamonds, silver, and copper — yet the local population remains among the poorest in Pakistan.","Pakistani troops fight insurgents who set up roadblocks in restive northwestern region of Balochistan. 18 paramilitaries and 23 rebels dead, three other Pakistani soldiers seriously wounded in some of the heaviest clashes in recent years.

Bilal Shabbir, Kalat’s deputy commissioner, said the attacks took place in Pidrang, Khazeni and Mangochar Bazaar areas of the town, where militants started conducting snap checks of passenger vehicles passing through town.In the first incident, Shabbir said a van carrying 17 soldiers from Panjgur to Quetta came under attack near the mountainous area of Khazeni, where armed men battled the security forces. He said one soldier of the Frontier Corps (FC), a paramilitary force, was separately killed in clashes with the militants.“The bodies of the slain soldiers were shifted to Quetta,” Shabbir said. “We don’t know how many attackers were killed because they took the bodies of their fighters into the mountains in the dark.”He said three FC personnel were also injured in the attack, adding that militants set a private bank on fire in Mangochar Bazaar.Separatist groups like BLA have long been at the forefront of a low-level insurgency in Balochistan, Pakistan's largest province by area and rich in mineral resources. Separatists claim that Islamabad is abusing the province’s natural wealth while ignoring the local population.In recent months, the BLA has become a major security threat, carrying out large-scale attacks in Balochistan and other parts of Pakistan, targeting Chinese nationals and interests engaged in investment projects, security forces, and ethnic Punjabis they perceive as outsiders in Balochistan.",At least 18 soldiers killed and five injured in Balochistan attacks.

Just months earlier, in August, the group launched a series of coordinated attacks that left at least 39 people dead, marking one of the deadliest escalations in recent years.Violence has also surged beyond Balochistan, with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province witnessing an increase in militant attacks.The Pakistani military reported that in 2024 alone, 383 soldiers and 925 militants were killed in various clashes.","18 paramilitary personnel killed in ambush in southwest Pakistan's Balochistan province.
