PUNE: A 25-year-old BPO worker, Shubhada Kodare, was hacked to death with a cleaver by a colleague in the parking lot of her office, while two dozen people remained mute spectators.Shubhada was attacked by 27-year-old Krishna Satyanarayan Kanojia on Tuesday, allegedly because she refused to return money borrowed from him on false pretext. She succumbed to injuries late Tuesday at a private hospital. Kanojia was arrested and investigation is on.A grainy minute-long video of the attack surfaced online Thursday, which showed the attacker calmly walking about with the cleaver before Shubhada slumped to the ground and a pool of blood formed around her. While 20-odd people witnessed the scene unfold on premises of the BPO where both the accused and the victim worked, none moved to stop the attacker. Some grabbed the assailant only after he tossed away the cleaver.Additional commissioner of police Manoj Patil said probe revealed that both Shubhada and Kanojia were working as executives in the accounts department of the BPO at Ramwadi in Yerawada. About a year ago, Shubhada, of Karad in Satara, told Kanojia that she needed money to support treatment of her father. He lent her money several times adding up to Rs 4 lakh.A few months ago, she informed Kanojia that her father would be operated upon. After a few days, Kanojia, as a good gesture, visited her father. He was shocked to learn that her father did not have any health issues.After this, Kanojia demanded his money back, but she picked arguments and lodged a non-cognisable offence against him three months ago, Patil said. He kept pursuing her to get his money back, but she avoided him and did not answer his calls.""Enraged, Kanojia came prepared and attacked her,"" he said.","Shubhada Kodare, 25, was hacked to death with a cleaver by a colleague in the parking lot of her office.

Greg Gutfeld took a jab at Taylor Swift

Gutfeld: The left’s ‘matrix of hoaxes’ is ‘imploding’

Fox News personality Greg Gutfeld , the host of a comedy-news hybrid show called Gutfeld that features unapologetic humor often bordering on politically incorrect jokes and body shaming, took aim at pop sensation Taylor Swift in the most recent episode of his program.Gutfeld is an American television host, political commentator, comedian, and author. Until March 2021, when the program became a weeknight offering, Gutfeld was the host of the late-night comedy talk show Gutfeld!, with its Saturday night version being known as The Greg Gutfeld Show.Greg Gutfeld, a comedian, took a jab at Taylor Swift saying she wasn't very smart and had a long list of break-ups. During an interview recently, Gutfeld targeted Swift's height and declared her a six at best. Gutfeld said, “Taylor Swift is a six at best,” sparking loud cheers from the audience.Gutfeld described ""The Trump Effect"" as the freedom to say what people knew, as opposed to what the media was saying, without fear of retribution. He said the election of Donald Trump marked a turning point in the change in society, making once censored opinions safe to say without consequence.Friday's episode marked the second hosted by Gutfeld in two months, following a paternity leave for his daughter's birth. Gutfeld, known for his sharp wit, has often directed biting humor at powerful figures, comparing President Biden to a corpse and fat-shaming The View's ladies.Gutfeld continues to criticize celebrities for blending politics and entertainment, a trend he's previously used to mock Swift's endorsement of Kamala Harris . “Apparently, this singer wanted to show she can make bad choices about women too.” Swift was accused of exploiting her fan base by promoting personal political agendas, disregarding Harris' efforts to address border and economic issues during her Vice President tenure.Also Read: “Never seen a referee huddle with a QB”: Fans trash Josh Allen and head referee Bill Vinovich after they were seen talking during Bills vs Broncos Greg Gutfeld is not alone in his criticism of politically vocal celebrities.

Political fallout and leadership challenges

Los Angeles is reeling under the devastating impact of multiple wildfires that have claimed at least 24 lives, destroyed thousands of homes, and forced over 150,000 residents to evacuate. As firefighters race against time to contain the blazes, fierce Santa Ana winds and a severe lack of rainfall have turned the city into a battleground, with flames ravaging entire neighborhoods. With officials warning of worsening conditions, the situation remains dire as the community grapples with the immense toll of the disaster.The death toll from the wildfires ravaging the Los Angeles area has climbed to 24, with 16 people still reported missing. This tragic update comes as firefighters brace for the return of strong Santa Ana winds, which are expected to intensify through midweek, with gusts reaching up to 65 mph in mountainous regions.Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone expressed concern about the forecast, emphasizing the challenges ahead. “We are prepared for the upcoming wind event,” he said, noting that additional water trucks and fire retardants are being deployed to mitigate the spread of flames.Evacuation orders have displaced over 150,000 residents, leaving many to wonder about the fate of their homes. Some have been allowed to return, only to find neighborhoods reduced to ashes.Altadena resident Jim Orlandini, who lost his hardware store but found his home intact, described the ordeal. “The whole time I was thinking, I don’t know what I’m going to find when I get back here. After 40 years, you have so much to lose. We’re thankful it didn’t.”The fires, which began last week, have consumed more than 62 square miles, leveling entire neighborhoods in Pasadena and the Palisades. Authorities have warned that the number of fatalities and missing individuals may rise as cadaver dogs continue systematic searches.Nearly 14,000 personnel, including teams from other states and Mexico, are on the ground. Their efforts have been bolstered by 1,400 fire engines and 84 aircraft. Even inmates from California’s prison system are assisting, although the program has faced criticism due to its low wages for dangerous work.Despite progress, officials warn that some fires remain active and highly dangerous. LA Fire Chief Kristin Crowley urged residents to stay away from scorched neighborhoods, citing risks like broken gas lines and unstable structures.Wealthy residents in Los Angeles are increasingly turning to private firefighting services, paying up to $2,000 per hour to protect their homes, reported the New York Post. While these private crews employ advanced equipment and techniques, their use has sparked outrage among the general public.Critics argue that these services divert resources from broader firefighting efforts. “So you’re suggesting lifesaving resources should be used to save your house because you’re rich while tens of thousands are evacuating?” read one viral post.Fire hydrants across Los Angeles have run dry, exacerbating the firefighting challenge. Up to 20% of the city’s hydrants were out of service at one point last week, forcing crews to rely on alternative water sources.Governor Gavin Newsom has called for an investigation into the failure. “We need answers to ensure this does not happen again,” he said, acknowledging mounting criticism over the state’s preparedness.Some residents, like Pacific Palisades homeowner Rachel Darvish, have voiced their frustration publicly. Darvish went viral after confronting Newsom, declaring, “I’ll fill up the hydrants myself.”The fires have destroyed over 12,000 structures, with early damage estimates reaching $150 billion. Governor Newsom has issued an executive order to expedite rebuilding, including suspending some environmental regulations and freezing property tax assessments.More than 24,000 residents have registered for federal assistance following President Joe Biden’s disaster declaration. However, rebuilding will be a long and arduous process, with officials urging the adoption of modern, fire-resistant standards.The wildfire crisis has intensified scrutiny of California’s leadership. Allegations of mismanagement, including the water shortages, have led to investigations and public outcry. Mayor Karen Bass and Governor Newsom face growing pressure to address the systemic issues that have compounded the disaster.Meanwhile, the National Weather Service has issued a rare “particularly dangerous situation” warning, underscoring the continued threat. Fire behavior analysts predict that Tuesday will be the most critical day.","The death toll from the wildfires ravaging the Los Angeles area has climbed to 24, with 16 people still reported missing.

Neil Gaiman: Neil Gaiman 'raped family nanny in outdoor bathtub': Shocking details emerge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/neil-gaiman-raped-family-nanny-in-outdoor-bathtub-shocking-details-emerge/articleshow/117213783.cms,"Neil Gaiman earlier dismissed the sexual assault allegations againt him as they surfaced last year.

False memories: What Gaiman said

A year after author Neil Gaiman was accused of sexual assault, more complaints have surfaced revealing shocking details of Gaiman's decades-long abuse of women in the family atmosphere. A Vulture report has compiled the allegations of a total of eight different women including one Scarlett Pavlovich who used to babysit Gaiman's child. Pavlovich was close to Gaiman's ex-wife Amanda Palmer and agreed to babysit their child when she was away. That was the first time she met Neil Gaiman and that encounter led to a non-consensual sexual encounter after Gaiman encouraged her to take bath in their old garden bathtub and later joined her. During that encounter, Gaiman wanted her to call him 'master'.'I said ""no."" I said, ""I'm not confident with my body,'"" Pavlovich said. '[Gaiman] said, ""It's okay — it's only me. Just relax. Just have a chat."" She described that he penetrated her with his fingers, before attempting to do so with his penis - all while she told him no. Pavlovich recalled how as Gaiman was climaxing, he asked if he could ejaculate on a certain part of her body - to which she declined. She claims he did so anyway.Pavlovich noted she confided in his ex-wife and filed a police report but the case didn't move forward as either Palmer or Gaiman didn't release a statement. She claims she later signed an NDA regarding the alleged sexual assault, where he paid her a total of $9,200 over nine months.The report highlights that most of the women he allegedly abused were in their 20s, with the youngest 18. He was in his 40s or older. Another woman, Kendra Stout, reveals the author ""didn't believe in foreplay or lubrication,"" and would engage in BDSM practises although ""there was no discussion of 'safe words' or 'aftercare' or 'limits.'""Since the first report broke out in 2024, the author and his representatives strongly denied all the allegations though it delivered a setback to the production of Good Omens. Gaiman reacted to the stories of Kendra Stout and Pavlovich and defended himself in both cases. He said his relationship with Kendra was never unlawful and said Pavlovich had a condition for which she had false memories.","A Vulture report has compiled the allegations of a total of eight different women including one Scarlett Pavlovich who used to babysit Gaiman's child.

FBI warns of potential ISIS-inspired attacks similar to New Orleans tragedy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fbi-warns-of-potential-isis-inspired-attacks-similar-to-new-orleans-tragedy/articleshow/117220941.cms,"New video from deadly New Orleans terror attack

The FBI has warned that the deadly New Year's Day vehicle attack in New Orleans could inspire ""copycat or retaliatory attacks"" across the United States. The warning follows the New Orleans attack, in which Shamsud-Din Jabbar , a US Army veteran and ISIS sympathiser, ploughed a truck into crowds on Bourbon Street, killing 14 people and injuring dozens more.The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) are particularly concerned about the increasing use of vehicle ramming as a tactic by violent extremists, noting that attackers are often inspired by foreign terrorist organisations (FTOs) and may seek to replicate such actions.The authorities issued the public service announcement, adding the growing threat from “aspiring violent extremist attackers” who have increasingly used vehicles as weapons. These attacks have been carried out with rented, stolen, or personally owned vehicles, which are easy to acquire, and may be accompanied by firearms, knives, or even improvised explosive devices (IEDs).Targets have typically included pedestrians, law enforcement officers, and crowded public venues, which are easily accessible from roadways. “We ask that the public remain vigilant regarding possible copycat or retaliatory attacks and report any suspicious activity to law enforcement,” the FBI urged.Jabbar’s attack in New Orleans unfolded in the early hours of January 1, when he drove a rented F-150 truck onto the pavement around a police blockade at Bourbon Street’s entrance, striking numerous people celebrating New Year’s. After exchanging gunfire with police, Jabbar was fatally shot at the scene. His vehicle was found to contain bomb-making materials, and authorities discovered that he had planted two IEDs, one of which was moved by an unsuspecting passerby before it could detonate.The FBI confirmed that Jabbar had pledged allegiance to ISIS shortly before the attack, posting videos online in which he declared his intention to wage war against ""non-believers.""In the months leading up to the attack, Jabbar conducted detailed surveillance in New Orleans, using Meta smart glasses to record videos of the French Quarter and identify key targets. The FBI believes he was planning the attack for several months, even making purchases for bomb-making materials in Texas before arriving in Louisiana.","Shamsud-Din Jabbar ploughed a truck into crowds on Bourbon Street, killing 14 people and injuring dozens more.

Gaza ceasefire proposal: All you need to know about Qatar’s plan to end violence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/gaza-ceasefire-proposal-all-you-need-to-know-about-qatars-plan-to-end-violence/articleshow/117220084.cms,"Hostage return and phased release plan



Gradual Israeli troop withdrawal



Increased humanitarian aid to Gaza



Gaza’s future governance remains unclear



Hope for a lasting resolution



Qatar mediators have proposed a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas, aiming to stop the ongoing conflict in Gaza and facilitate the exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners. The proposal comes after 15 months of fighting, with hopes for a breakthrough in the region.Negotiations in Doha have reportedly made significant progress, as the international community watches closely. The timing of the talks is particularly critical, coming just a week before US President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration.The draft proposal outlines a two-stage process for the return of hostages. In the first phase, 33 hostages would be freed, including children, women, men over 50, and those who are injured or sick. Israel believes most of the hostages are alive but has not received official confirmation from Hamas.The second phase, beginning on the 16th day after the agreement takes effect, would focus on releasing remaining living hostages, particularly male soldiers and men of military age, while also returning the bodies of those who have died.As part of the deal, Israeli forces would gradually withdraw, with plans to remain stationed at the border for security purposes. Some areas, including parts of the Philadelphi corridor and the Netzarim corridor in central Gaza, would see Israeli troops pull out. North Gaza’s unarmed residents would be allowed to return under strict conditions to prevent weapons movement.Palestinian militants convicted of deadly attacks would also be released, though the number of prisoners freed would depend on the number of hostages still alive. Hamas fighters responsible for the October 7, 2023, attacks on Israel would not be part of the release.A significant portion of Qatar’s proposal calls for the increase of humanitarian aid to Gaza, where international bodies like the United Nations have raised alarms about a severe crisis. Although Israel allows some aid into the region, disputes over distribution and looting have complicated relief efforts.A key issue yet to be addressed is the future governance of Gaza. Israel has firmly stated that Hamas cannot play a role in Gaza’s future and has rejected the involvement of the Palestinian Authority. Israel’s position is that it will maintain security control over Gaza after the conflict ends.Discussions have taken place between Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States about the possibility of a provisional administration to govern Gaza until a reformed Palestinian Authority can take charge. However, alternatives to existing factions, such as civil society groups or clan leaders, have largely failed to gain traction.As Qatar continues its mediation efforts, the international community remains hopeful that a lasting ceasefire and solution can be achieved, despite the many challenges that lie ahead.","Qatar mediators have proposed a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas, aiming to stop the ongoing conflict in Gaza.

A ‘robust response’ to tariff threats

Outgoing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is using his final days in office to voice concerns about former US President Donald Trump ’s remarks on turning Canada into the ""51st state."" Speaking to MSNBC’s Jen Psaki in a wide-ranging interview on Sunday, Trudeau revealed details of a conversation with Trump during a meeting at Mar-a-Lago in November.“It actually sort of came up at one point,” Trudeau said, referring to Trump’s earlier comments about annexing Canada. “We started musing back and forth about this. And when I jokingly suggested we could trade for Vermont or California, he didn’t find it amusing anymore. The conversation quickly shifted.”Trudeau dismissed the notion outright, emphasizing Canada’s sovereignty. “That’s not going to happen. Canadians are incredibly proud of being Canadian,” he said, adding that such discussions served as a distraction from pressing trade issues, including Trump’s threats of imposing tariffs on Canadian exports .Trump has repeatedly made provocative statements about Canada, referring to the country as the “51st state,” labeling Trudeau its “governor,” and even suggesting NHL legend Wayne Gretzky as a potential prime ministerial candidate.In the interview, Trudeau shifted the focus to Trump’s economic policies, warning of significant consequences if tariffs on Canadian goods are implemented. “If he does choose to go forward with tariffs that raise costs for American citizens, we will have to respond robustly,” Trudeau stated.While Trudeau acknowledged that Trump’s rhetoric often veered into the hypothetical — including past remarks about purchasing Greenland and reclaiming the Panama Canal — he urged leaders to address tangible challenges instead of entertaining far-fetched scenarios.Trudeau’s resignation announcement this week has sparked speculation about his political future, but his sharp remarks against Trump’s proposals suggest he isn’t shying away from leaving an enduring political legacy.Trump, meanwhile, has not ruled out extreme measures regarding other territorial aspirations, saying during a recent Mar-a-Lago press conference, “The Panama Canal is vital to our country. We need Greenland for national security purposes.”","Justin Trudeau revealed details of a conversation with Trump during a meeting at Mar-a-Lago in November.

A Texas man faced felony stalking charges for harassing WNBA star Caitlin Clark after sending sexually explicit messages and travelling to Indiana to be in close vicinity of the basketball player.55-year-old Michael Thomas Lewis allegedly harassed the 22-year-old Indiana Fever player from December 16 till January 11, according to the Marion County prosecutor 's office. Lewis is scheduled for a court appearance Tuesday. He reportedly sent numerous messages to Clark's X account, including some that were sexually explicit, according to a sheriff's affidavit.One message claimed he drove by Gainbridge Fieldhouse, where the Fever plays, three times daily. Another said he had “one foot on a banana peel and the other on a stalking charge.” Prosecutors say these messages made Clark feel “terrorized, frightened, intimidated, or threatened” and constituted an implicit or explicit threat “with the intent to place Caitlin Clark in reasonable fear of sexual battery.”Additionally, according to court documents cited by The New York Times, Clark had ""altered her public appearances and patterns of movement"" because she feared for her safety.The FBI traced the messages to Lewis and IP addresses linked to an Indianapolis hotel and library. Indianapolis police questioned Lewis at his hotel on January 8. He claimed he was on vacation but added, “Just the same reason everybody makes posts.”He denied harmful intent, claiming he fantasized about a relationship with Clark. He told police, “It’s an imagination, fantasy type thing and it’s a joke, and it’s nothing to do with threatening.” Prosecutors are requesting a higher-than-standard bond, citing Lewis's travel from Texas to Indianapolis “with the intent to be in close proximity to the victim.” They also want a stay-away order from the Gainbridge and Hinkle fieldhouses. ""No matter how prominent a figure you are, this case shows that online harassment can quickly escalate to actual threats of physical violence,"" the Marion County prosecutor, said in a statementClark, the 2024 AP Female Athlete of the Year, was the WNBA's top draft pick and Rookie of the Year after leading Iowa to the NCAA championship game last year.","Michael Thomas Lewis, 55, allegedly harassed the 22-year-old Indiana Fever player from December 16 till January 11.

'Ban flow of critical minerals': Ex-Trudeau ally Jagmeet Singh responds to threats by 'bully' Donald Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ban-flow-of-critical-minerals-ex-trudeau-ally-jagmeet-singh-responds-to-threats-by-bully-donald-trump/articleshow/117219588.cms,"Canada's New Democratic Party (NDP) leader Jagmeet Singh responded sharply to threats made by US president-elect Donald Trump , warning that such actions could harm Canada’s economy and workforce.Singh described Trump’s recent tariff threats as a “clear” danger to Canadian jobs and warned they could further burden citizens already grappling with rising living costs. “Donald Trump is a clear threat to Canada,” Singh said.“His tariff threats are directly threatening hundreds and thousands of Canadian jobs. They also threaten to increase the cost of living at a time when people are already struggling with the cost of groceries and the cost of their bills. So it is serious. We have to take it seriously.”Singh, who previously helped Prime Minister Justin Trudeau maintain a minority government, has been a vocal critic of the Liberal Party’s handling of key domestic issues. He also expressed frustration with the government’s inability to effectively address the challenges posed by Trump’s threats. “Going to meet with them, trying to wine and dine them, is a failed approach,” Singh said.“Donald Trump is not rational. You can't discuss a plan over a meal with him. He is a bully. And bullies understand one thing: strength.”He further elaborated that if Trump is serious about escalating tensions, Canada must respond in kind. “If he wants to pick a fight with Canada, we have to make sure it's clear that it's going to hurt Americans as well. There’s going to be pain felt for not just Canadians, but also Americans,” Singh warned.His solution is straightforward: “We know that the United States needs our critical minerals. They're very important for the United States. So I'm calling on all political leaders to support turning off the taps on those critical minerals.”Singh argued that halting the flow of vital minerals to the US could be an effective way to force Trump to reconsider his aggressive stance. “There’s no quicker way to get Donald Trump to back away from tariffs than to shut off the tap on critical minerals that the States need very clearly,” Singh asserted.Singh’s comments come as tensions between the US and Canada escalate following Trump’s controversial remarks suggesting that Canada could become the 51st state. Speaking from his Mar-a-Lago resort, Trump reiterated his belief that dissolving the “artificially drawn line” between the two nations would benefit both countries, particularly in terms of national security.In response, Singh took a strong stance, rejecting any notion of Canada’s integration into the United States. “I have a message for Donald Trump. Our country's not for sale. Not now, not ever,” Singh declared. “I’ve lived across this country, and I can tell you Canadians are a proud people. We're proud of our country, and we're ready to fight like hell to defend it.”This call for action echoes Singh’s broader critique of Trudeau's leadership, which has faced criticism over the handling of rising living costs, housing, and healthcare.Despite the looming threat from the US, Singh believes the Trudeau administration has failed to prioritise the protection of Canadian jobs and sovereignty. “We’ve got serious threats of Donald Trump and tariffs that put in question hundreds and thousands of Canadian jobs,” Singh said.","Singh described Trump’s recent tariff threats as a “clear’ danger to Canadian jobs and warned they could further burden citizens already grappling with rising living costs. “Donald Trump is not rational.

Justice Department releases Hunter Biden special counsel report

What were the charges against Hunter Biden?

Special counsel David Weiss defended his investigation into Hunter Biden on Monday, rejecting US President Joe Biden's claims of mistreatment in an attempt to target him.In a new report, Weiss, the lead prosecutor in the probes, stated the gun and tax charges against the president's son stemmed from impartial investigations, not politics.President Biden pardoned his son last month, citing what he called a “miscarriage of justice” and selective prosecution. He stated his son was treated “differently” due to his last name.“No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter’s cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son — and that is wrong,” Biden said.Weiss countered these claims directly. “The president’s characterizations are incorrect based on the facts in this case, and, on a more fundamental level, they are wrong,” Weiss wrote.Weiss emphasised that the prosecutions demonstrated equal application of the law. “Far from selective, these prosecutions were the embodiment of the equal application of justice — no matter who you are, or what your last name is, you are subject to the same laws as everyone else in the United States,” Weiss said. He also criticized the president for using the pardon to attack the Justice Department. He wrote that no other president had used a pardon to ""malign the public servants at the Department of Justice based solely on false accusations.""The legal proceedings against Hunter Biden originated from his conviction in June 2023 on three felony charges concerning a firearm acquisition in 2018. He provided false information on his firearm application form regarding his substance use status. These charges emerged from an extensive investigation into his activities, which were connected to his substance dependency issues. The federal court pursued the case to conviction, despite the contextual circumstances.Joe Biden offered support for his son's situation, noting that similar cases typically avoid criminal prosecution, particularly when substance dependency is a factor. He mentioned that Hunter Biden has maintained sobriety for more than five years whilst facing these legal challenges.In September 2024, Hunter Biden entered a guilty plea for nine tax-related offences, involving unpaid taxes exceeding $1.4 million from earnings he utilised for luxury expenditures, including escorts, substances, and vehicles. The investigation, which commenced in 2018, led to these charges. His defence team contended that he received disproportionate scrutiny from Republicans, with allegations that the prosecution was politically driven to undermine Joe Biden's presidential aspirations. The presidential pardon nullified any potential imprisonment for these tax violations.","US President Joe Biden pardoned his son last month, citing what he called a “miscarriage of justice” and selective prosecution.

ISLAMABAD: Nobel Peace laureate Malala Yousafzai criticized Taliban on Sunday, saying that they do not regard women as human beings and has established a system of “gender apartheid,” justifying their crimes with cultural and religious excuses.“Taliban do not see women as human beings. They cloak their crimes in cultural and religious justifications. They punish women and girls who dare to defy their opaque laws by beating, arresting, or injuring them,” Malala said at a summit in Islamabad focused on girls’ education in Muslim countries.Since retaking power in Afghanistan in 2021, Taliban regime has enforced a strict interpretation of Islamic law, depriving women of participation in many areas of public life. Their restrictions have prevented women and girls from attending secondary and university schools, as well as holding many govt jobs.“They want to eliminate women and girls from every aspect of public life and erase them from society. These policies have no basis in Islamic teachings,” she said.Malala called on Muslim leaders to demonstrate true leadership by refusing to legitimize Taliban govt. “It is time for Muslim leaders to raise your voices and use your power to oppose such injustices,” she added.Afghanistan's Taliban govt snubbed the event by rejecting the invitation.

Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan , currently in Adiala Jail , demanded a transparent investigation and the establishment of a judicial commission to examine violence on November 26 and May 9. He communicated this demand to lawyers and media during a meeting at the jail.Regarding ongoing negotiations in the country, Khan expressed skepticism, stating, ""The government's non-serious attitude towards negotiations is evident from the fact that I haven't even been allowed to meet with my negotiation committee yet. It seems like the purpose of negotiations is merely to waste time so that public reaction over the November 26th Islamabad massacre starts to fade.""Khan called for an impartial judicial commission to investigate the incidents, particularly the November 26 event. ""Peaceful citizens were massacred on November 26th; they were directly shot at, and D-Chowk was drenched in their blood. Many of our people are still missing. In any civilized society, those responsible for such shootings would have been held accountable, but this government has not even managed to form a judicial commission yet. A judicial commission acts as a (neutral) third umpire. Only an impartial commission can provide justice to the martyrs of November 26th (2024) and May 9th (2023). If this massacre is swept under the rug, no one’s life or property in Pakistan will be safe,"" he said.He also alleged mistreatment of PTI members in custody and called for these claims to be raised internationally. ""While in military custody, our innocent people were subjected to severe mental and physical torture. According to my information, three young men attempted suicide during custody. Sami Wazir’s condition is a stark testament to this brutality. What happened to PTI leaders like Shahbaz Gill and Azam Swati is no secret. Zille Shah was brutally murdered, and Intezar Panjutha was treated worse than animals. What kind of justice is this? Those who leave PTI are absolved of any charges related to May 9th, while those who refuse are subjected to all kinds of torture and pressure,"" Khan stated.Further threatening to take the alleges injustice to global forums, the ex-Pakistan PM added, ""We haven't obtained justice despite repeatedly appealing to Pakistan’s judicial system, leaving us with no choice but to raise our voice on international forums. Pakistan’s government is bound by international laws and treaties regarding human rights. I have instructed our lawyers to take these matters to global forums and draw the world’s attention to the ongoing human rights violations in Pakistan.""In connection to the May 9 case, Imran Khan has approached the Lahore High Court for bail, according to ARY News. The case is centred around severe unrest across Pakistan following Imran Khan's arrest on May 9, 2023. Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) supporters demonstrated their outrage through widespread protests in both rural and urban areas, prompting authorities to deploy military forces in Balochistan, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Islamabad to maintain security. During these demonstrations, PTI supporters targeted military facilities, including an assault on the Corps Commander's residence in Lahore. Subsequently, Imran Khan was named as the primary accused in the legal proceedings. The November 26 protests were also centred on similar demands with PTI members demanding release of their leader.Khan also addressed the people of Pakistan saying, ""My message to overseas Pakistanis is that democracy and human rights have been obliterated in Pakistan, to be replaced by the law of the jungle. Your boycott of foreign currency remittances is critical. Your loved ones in Pakistan deserve the same rights that you enjoy abroad.""Khan also talked about the fake allegations and cases against him while putting forward the demand for transparent investigation and justice. ""Our government was falsely accused of resettling the Taliban. Terrorism did not resurface during our tenure, and even a year after it ended. The same people who are responsible for conditions in Balochistan are also responsible for the current chaos,"" he said adding, "" No leader in Pakistan’s history has ever faced 280 cases. This kind of treatment was only meted out to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman during General Yahya's rule, and now it is being done to me.""Additionally, citing a World Bank report, Khan expressed concern about rising poverty and the impact of political instability on the economy. ""according to a recent World Bank report, an additional 13 million people have fallen below the poverty line. Every institution, including the judiciary, NAB, FIA, and police, have been tasked to work against PTI, causing political and economic systems to collapse and instability to reach its peak. Economic growth will remain zero as long as political instability persists. All of this is being done to bolster the plan for a decade-long dictatorship. Anyone who supports this lawlessness can have their corruption of billions pardoned.""According to PTI, Khan has been imprisoned for over 520 days.",Former Pakistan PM Imran Khan is currently in Adiala Jail.

ISLAMABAD: Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Malala Yousafzai will attend an international summit on girls' education hosted by her native Pakistan, where she was nearly killed by militants as a schoolgirl.Yousafzai was evacuated from the country in 2012 after being shot by the Pakistan Taliban , who were enraged by her activism, and she has returned to the country only a handful of times since.A spokesperson for the Malala Fund charity confirmed Yousafzai will appear in person at the summit, which will focus on education in Islamic nations.""I am excited to join Muslim leaders from around the world for a critical conference on girls' education,"" she said on Friday in a post on social media platform X.""On Sunday, I will speak about protecting rights for all girls to go to school, and why leaders must hold the Taliban accountable for their crimes against Afghan women & girls.""Pakistan's education minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui told AFP the Taliban government in Afghanistan has been invited to attend, although Islamabad has not received a response.""Nevertheless, representatives from various organisations dedicated to girls' education in Afghanistan will be participating in the event,"" he said.Afghanistan is the only country in the world where girls and women are banned from going to school and university.Since returning to power in 2021, the Taliban government there has imposed an austere version of Islamic law that the United Nations has called "" gender apartheid "".Girls are only allowed to attend primary school, while women are largely restricted to working in segregated environments in health or education.The Taliban administration claims that Islamic law ""guarantees"" the rights of Afghan men and women.- Focus on Muslim world -The two-day summit backed by the Saudi Arabia-based Muslim World League will be held in the Pakistani capital on Saturday and Sunday and opened by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.It brings together ministers, ambassadors and religious scholars from 44 countries, as well as representatives from the UN and World Bank.Tens of millions of girls are out of school in Muslim-majority countries, including Bangladesh and Nigeria.Pakistan is facing a severe education crisis with more than 26 million children out of school, mostly as a result of poverty, according to official government figures -- one of the highest rates in the world.The summit will confirm ""the shared commitment of (the) Muslim community to empower girls through education"", according to a government statement.Yousafzai became a household name after she was attacked by Pakistan Taliban militants on a school bus in the remote Swat valley.Militancy was widespread in the region at the time as the war between the Afghan Taliban and NATO forces raged across the border in Afghanistan.The Pakistan and Afghan Taliban are separate groups but share close links and similar ideologies, including a strong disbelief in educating girls.Yousafzai was evacuated to the United Kingdom and went on to become a global advocate for girls' education and, at the age of 17, the youngest Nobel Peace Prize winner.",Malala Yousafzai will attend an international summit on girls' education in Pakistan.

KARACHI: Armed militants stormed a police checkpost in Pakistan's restive Balochistan province and also set fire to machinery and equipment of a cement factory in the vicinity before escaping from the scene, authorities said.

Armed outlaws in Pakistan's Punjab province kidnapped three Hindus and issued an ultimatum, demanding the release of their accomplices from police custody.The incident took place in the Bhong area of Rahim Yar Khan district, around 400 kilometers southwest of Lahore, on Wednesday.The victims, identified as Shaman, Shameer, and Sajan, were near the Chowk Sawetra Basic Health Unit (BHU) in Bhong when five armed dacoits abducted them at gunpoint and took them to the Katcha riverine area, a region notorious for criminal activity.In a video released later by the outlaws’ ringleader Ashiq Korai, the gang threatened Ahmedpur Lama police station officer Rana Ramzan, warning that if Korai’s 10 family members were not freed, the kidnapped youths would be killed.The gang also threatened to attack the police. The video showed the abducted Hindus in chains, pleading for their release.The incident shows the ongoing lawlessness in the Katcha area, a riverine belt spanning parts of southern Punjab and Sindh provinces. Despite multiple operations, authorities have struggled to curb the power of these criminal gangs, who frequently engage in kidnappings for ransom and target minority Hindu communities to pressure authorities into compliance.Last year, the region witnessed a deadly attack on police, with 12 officers killed and seven injured when dacoits ambushed two police vehicles in the same district.","Armed outlaws in Pakistan's Punjab province kidnapped three Hindus and issued an ultimatum, demanding the release of their accomplices from police custody.

At least 161 claims were found to be false or untrue, said the report.In a bid to alley fear among the minorities the government reiterated its zero-tolerance policy towards any communal attacks in the country, stressing police have been ordered to arrest the culprits.The government has also announced that it will compensate the victims.","Bangladesh's interim government has attempted to downplay the attacks on minority communities.

Palace officials feared the news that her art adivisor was also a Russian agent would upset her.This was revealed as the the National Archives released MI5 intelligence files about the royal art historian, offering fresh insights into a Cambridge University-linked spy network from the 1930s that leaked classified information to the Soviet Union from within British intelligence.Blunt, the Surveyor of the Queen’s Pictures, confessed in 1964 to giving information to the KGB while working for MI5 during World War II. The released documents indicate that Blunt experienced ""profound relief"" after his confession. He also retained his job and knighthood for cooperation.In 1972, the Queen’s private secretary, Martin Charteris, told MI5 “the queen did not know and he saw no advantage in telling her about it now; it would only add to her worries and there was nothing that could done about him.”However, due to Blunt’s illness and fear of media scrutiny upon his death, the Queen was finally informed in 1973. Charteris revealed that the queen received the news calmly and recalled earlier suspicions from the 1950s. MI5's official historian Christopher Andrew noted that the queen had previously received ""general terms"" information about Blunt.Later, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher publicly revealed Blunt’s spying in 1979. He lost his knighthoot but wasn't prosecuted, and died in 1983.The files are part of a future National Archives exhibition. They also include another Cambridge spy Kim Philby’s confession about betraying KGB defector Konstantin Volkov, who was later abducted and killed. “I really did feel a tremendous loyalty to MI6. I was treated very, very well in it and I made some really marvelous friends there,” Philby said. ""But the overruling inspiration was the other side.” Philby later escaped to Moscow.","Newly declassified MI5 files reveal Queen Elizabeth II was initially unaware of her close aide was also a Russian spy.

It doesn't have eyelashes and things like that because I wanted it to be monocular. It's almost like a camera lens staring at you all the time, unblinking.""The novel, set in a fictional future, depicts civil servant Winston Smith's secret rebellion against a totalitarian government and its leader, Big Brother.Orwell, who also wrote the political fable ""Animal Farm,"" died in a London hospital at age 46 on January 21, 1950, a few months after ""Nineteen Eighty-four"" was published.The Royal Mint said the collector's coin will be released on Wednesday with prices starting from 17.50 pounds each.Other literary figures who have been commemorated on 2-pound coins include William Shakespeare, Jane Austen and JRR Tolkien.","The 2-pound (USD 2.40) coin depicts what appears to be an eye but is a camera lens.
