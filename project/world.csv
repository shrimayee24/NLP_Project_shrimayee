Government: Governor can scrap bill by withholding assent,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-governor-can-scrap-bill-by-withholding-assent/articleshow/123420773.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: Amid conflicts between governors and opposition-led governments in states, the Centre on Wednesday told Supreme Court that if a governor, in rare and extraordinary circumstances, chooses to withhold assent to a bill passed by a state assembly, the bill gets scrapped.Solicitor general (SG) Tushar Mehta had to labour a good part of the day before a five-judge Constitution bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar to explain the sweeping power conferred on governors through Article 200 of the Constitution.The proposition, which the SG said, is backed by two five-judge SC bench judgments categorically stating that if a governor exercised the option of withholding assent, then the bill ""falls through"", evoked questions from a bench that was clearly alive to frequent stalemates between governors and state govts over indefinite pendency of bills with the former.Mehta said on a bill, the governor has options of granting assent, withholding assent, reserving it for the President's consideration or returning it to the assembly with suggestions for modification. ""Once he declares he has withheld assent, the bill falls through. The governor then cannot exercise any of the other three options,"" he said. ""The governor can simpliciter withhold assent ...if he believes the bill is unconstitutional or beyond any remedial changes, in which case the bill would 'fall through' or lapse as has been observed in several SC judgments by five-judge benches.Solicitor general (SG) Tushar Mehta argued that the Constitution fixes no timeline for governors, in exercise of their plenary powers, to choose any of the four options. ""The constitutional provision conferring such powers on the governor can only be amended by Parliament and the judiciary cannot encroach on the legislative domain in the guise of interpretation,"" Mehta said in what appeared to be a challenge aimed at the verdict of a two-judge bench fixing deadlines for governors and the President to take a call on bills sent to them for assent.CJI Gavai said similar arguments were advanced by ruling dispensations when it came to SC directing the speaker to decide within a timeframe petitions on disqualification of MLAs under the anti-defection law. For the sake of democracy, SC has fixed timelines for speakers in such cases, he said.Mehta, however, argued that the two cases are not alike since the speaker, while adjudicating petitions under the anti-defection law, acts as a tribunal and not in his/her constitutional capacity. It is a settled law that as a tribunal he is amenable to the jurisdictions of HCs and SC, he further argued. The SG said discretionary power to 'withhold assent to a bill' is one of the few areas, delineated by the Constitution, where the governor is not bound by the aid and advice of the council of ministers of the state. ""Because no council of ministers would advise the governor to withhold assent to a bill, yet that power is specifically given by the Constitutio,"" he said.The SG cited 10 illustrative situations where the governor would be well within his discretionary powers to withhold assent to a bill to render it ineffective. He said, for instance, if a border state enacts a law allowing citizens of a neighbouring country free entry into the state, the governor would be justified in withholding assent.","Solicitor general (SG) Tushar Mehta had to labour a good part of the day before a five-judge Constitution bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar. He said on a bill, the governor has options of granting assent, withholding assent or reserving it for the President's consideration.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123420783,imgsize-1055243,width-400,resizemode-4/123420783.jpg"

‘India Profiting From Russian Oil’: Scott Bessent Hits Out Again Over Arbitrage, But Backs China

NEW DELHI: The ministry of external affairs on Wednesday dismissed concerns raised by Bangladesh's interim government led by Muhammad Yunus , clarifying that India does not permit political activities targeting other countries from its soil and calling Dhaka's remarks ""misplaced.""MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in an official statement: ""The Government of India is not aware of any anti-Bangladesh activities by purported members of Awami League in India or of any action that is contrary to Indian law.""He added, ""The Government does not allow political activities against other countries to be carried out from Indian soil.""Describing the Yunus government’s statement as ""misplaced,"" Jaiswal further reflected on Bangladesh's upcoming polls: ""India reiterates its expectation that free, fair and inclusive elections will be held at the earliest in Bangladesh to ascertain the will and mandate of the people.""According to Bangladesh news portal BSS, Dhaka earlier urged India to take immediate action to shut down political offices of the banned Bangladesh Awami League, reportedly operating in New Delhi and Kolkata.In a statement, Bangladesh’s foreign ministry said, ""Any form of political activity campaigning against the interests of Bangladesh by Bangladeshi nationals, particularly by the absconding leaders/activists of a banned political party, staying on Indian soil, legally or illegally, including the establishment of offices, is an unambiguous affront against the people and State of Bangladesh.""The reaction came a day after Bangladesh army chief General Waker-uz-Zaman said the military was prepared to assist the interim government in ensuring ""free, fair and neutral"" general elections scheduled for February next year.In Sheikh Hasina's absence, former prime minister Khaleda Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has emerged as the single largest party after Yunus’ government disbanded Awami League activities through an executive order.Meanwhile, an offshoot of Students Against Discrimination (SAD) - the group that spearheaded protests against Hasina -- launched the National Citizen Party (NCP) in February, reportedly with Yunus’ support. The NCP is believed to have developed ties with the far-right Jamaat-e-Islami and other Islamist groups in opposition to the BNP.","MEA: India does not permit political activities targeting other countries from its soil.

His screams reached his mother Maya, 40. She ran and locked in battle with the reptile - known to have the strongest bite force of any living animal, allowing it to take down large prey and easily crush bone.""Without thinking about my life, I jumped in,"" Maya said later. ""The crocodile was pulling him down, but I held on with all my strength. I hit it, clawed at it, and refused to let go. I fought with everything I had. Finally, it released my child after a blow from an iron rod I had grabbed. My son survived and that is what matters.""Veeru suffered serious injuries. Maya came away bruised. Both were taken to a local health facility.Her son remains under treatment.DFO Ram Singh Yadav assured the family a special operation would be launched to capture the crocodile, which has slipped back into the nullah.

NEW DELHI: Mumbai’s heavy rains on Tuesday worsened the city’s situation as a Monorail train broke down and got stuck between Chembur and Bhakti Park stations, leaving over 500 passengers stranded, who were later rescued.Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis assured that all passengers would be rescued safely and an inquiry would be conducted into the incident.""Due to some technical reason, a Monorail is stuck between Chembur and Bhakti Park. MMRDA (Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority), the fire brigade, and the municipal corporation, all agencies have reached the spot.

An inquiry will also be conducted into why this incident occurred,"" he said.Municipal Commissioner Bhushan Gagrani confirmed that around 200 passengers were inside the train.Deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde said the Monorail was overcrowded because local train services were suspended due to waterlogging caused by the ongoing heavy rains. ""In one coach there were around 70-75 people which led to overcrowding of coach,"" he said.

Local businesses brace for economic impact amid U.S. tariffs

Wayne Gretzky’s reputation caught in the crossfire

Brantford, Ontario, long celebrated as the hometown of hockey legend Wayne Gretzky, is now facing unexpected economic turbulence as U.S. tariffs on Canadian goods take effect. Local businesses, residents, and even Gretzky’s legacy are feeling the ripple effects of the trade measures announced by President Donald Trump.Graeme Roustan, owner of the historic Roustan Hockey company, expressed frustration at the sudden trade restrictions. “It’s totally ridiculous. This business here has been in place for 178 years and it’s been selling product and trading product with the United States since before Canada was a country,” he said. With finished hockey sticks destined for U.S. customers facing a 25% tariff, Roustan and other manufacturers are rushing shipments to avoid extra costs.Brantford’s economy, tightly linked to cross-border trade, is especially vulnerable. Mayor Kevin Davis noted that some local businesses sell up to 80% of their products in the U.S., while also relying on American suppliers for raw materials.“There’ll be industries in Brantford that may shut down, they may reduce production, they may have to retool, and – for a year or two – not be producing much and employing less,” he warned.Despite this, Davis emphasized the city’s resilience: “You know, we’re nice until we’re not. And yeah, if you want a war, then it’s a war. But it’s a, it’s a totally meaningless war from my perspective.”Beyond economics, the tariffs have stirred controversy around Gretzky himself. Though long admired as Canada’s “Great One,” his public ties to Trump, including attending the inauguration and wearing a MAGA hat, have drawn criticism.Some Canadians have gone so far as to label him a “traitor” online. Local fans, however, remain measured. Rick Mannen, attending a game at the Wayne Gretzky Sports Centre, said, “I wish he would say to Donald ‘back off and treat Canada as a partner instead of trying to take over.’”Also Read: Wayne Gretzky’s daughter Paulina Gretzky enjoys Jason Derulo’s LIV Golf concert while teasing her own music future As Brantford navigates the fallout, many residents are turning to Canadian-made products, reflecting a renewed sense of local support. While the city faces challenges from the tariffs, its history of resilience and community pride remains strong, showing that even amidst political and economic uncertainty, Brantford continues to honor its iconic roots.In tense political times, can “The Great One” be both a Donald Trump supporter and a beloved hero in Canada? Some want him to pick a side.","Brantford, Ontario, long celebrated as the hometown of hockey legend Wayne Gretzky, is now facing unexpected economic turbulence as U.S. tariffs on Canadian goods take effect.

Redistricting row: Texas Republicans approve Donald Trump-backed redrawn maps in House; Democrats vow legal fight,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/redistricting-row-texas-republicans-approve-donald-trump-backed-redrawn-maps-in-house-democrats-vow-legal-fight/articleshow/123420719.cms,"Texas Speaker of the House Dustin Burrows, R-Lubbock, oversees a debate over a redrawn US congressional map in Texas during a special session, in Austin, Texas. (Pictur ecredit: AP)





The Texas House passed a controversial mid-decade redistricting plan on Wednesday that could hand Republicans five additional seats in the US House of Representatives, triggering a coast-to-coast battle over congressional maps ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.The new boundaries were approved in an 88-52 party-line vote after weeks of political confrontation, reported news agency Associated Press. The move came following direct pressure from US President Donald Trump, who urged Texas lawmakers to deliver what he described as a “big beautiful map” to secure the GOP’s slim majority in Washington.The redrawn districts now move to the Republican-controlled state Senate before heading to Governor Greg Abbott, who has signalled he will sign them into law.Texas Democrats had attempted to derail the measure by leaving the state earlier this month, delaying proceedings for over two weeks. Upon their return, many were assigned round-the-clock police escorts to prevent another walkout.Several even staged overnight sit-ins at the Capitol in protest, as per the New York Times.Now they have vowed to contest the new law in court and have expressed concerns that Republicans undertook this political manoeuvre before enacting legislation in response to the deadly floods that affected the state last month.Republicans made little effort to disguise the motive behind the map. Todd Hunter, the Republican legislator who authored the plan, told colleagues, “The underlying goal of this plan is straightforward: improve Republican political performance”, as quoted by AP.Democrats condemned the move as undemocratic and racially discriminatory. “In a democracy, people choose their representatives. This bill flips that on its head and lets politicians in Washington choose their voters,” said Democratic Representative Chris Turner, as cited by AP.His colleague John H Bucy directly blamed the president, declaring, “This is Donald Trump’s map. It clearly and deliberately manufactures five more Republican seats in Congress.”The vote has already fuelled retaliation. California’s Democratic governor Gavin Newsom vowed to “fight fire with fire,” saying state lawmakers would introduce a rival plan to create five new Democratic-leaning districts.As per news agency AFP, the proposal would need voter approval in a November referendum because California usually relies on an independent commission to draw maps. Former President Barack Obama has endorsed Newsom’s effort, calling it a “smart, measured approach” to counter Texas.Other battleground states are now under pressure to follow suit. Republicans in Indiana, Missouri, Ohio and Florida are considering similar mid-cycle redraws, while Democrats in New York and Maryland are weighing their options despite stricter state limits.Civil rights groups are preparing legal challenges in Texas, pointing out that every redistricting cycle since the 1970s has seen courts find the legislature in violation of the Voting Rights Act.As per AP, critics argue the latest map weakens Black representation in Congress despite claims by Republicans that it increases minority-majority districts.State Representative Ron Reynolds, a Democrat, warned colleagues about their legacy and said, “Just like the people who were on the wrong side of history in 1965, history will be looking at the people who made the decisions in this body today.”Republicans, however, brushed aside accusations of racial bias. Katrina Pierson, a former Trump spokesperson turned lawmaker, told Democrats, “You call my voters racist, you call my party racist and yet we’re expected to follow the rules. There are Black and Hispanic and Asian Republicans in this chamber who were elected just like you.”With Trump personally lobbying Republican leaders across multiple states, and Democrats mobilising in response, the Texas map marks the opening clash in what could become a decisive national redistricting war ahead of 2026.",The Texas House passed a controversial mid-decade redistricting plan on Wednesday that could hand Republicans five additional seats in the US House of Representatives.

Hamas gunmen launched a rare raid on an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) encampment in southern Gaza on Wednesday morning, leaving four Israeli soldiers wounded, one of them seriously. According to a military probe cited by the Times of Israel, at least 18 Hamas operatives emerged from a tunnel in the Khan Younis area at around 9am and opened fire with machine guns and RPGs as they advanced on a position manned by the Kfir Brigade’s Nahshon Battalion. Some of the attackers managed to breach the perimeter, sparking close-quarters combat inside the compound.The IDF said its troops fought back with small arms and air support, killing around ten of the militants, while eight others retreated into the tunnel. “The troops identified more than 15 terrorists who emerged from a tunnel and opened fire, including RPG fire, at the forces,” IDF Spokesman Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin told reporters. “In the same incident, several terrorists entered a building where our forces were residing, and the terrorists were eliminated. We are investigating how this occurred, and will draw the necessary conclusions.”Footage released by the army showed airstrikes carried out to support the soldiers and a tank from the 74th Armored Battalion ramming into an RPG-wielding fighter.Videos circulating online also showed the bodies of two operatives inside the encampment. The wounded soldiers were all members of the Nahshon Battalion, with one in serious condition and two listed in good condition, according to the IDF.In a statement, the military described the battle as “close-quarters combat,” adding that its forces were still pursuing other militants believed to have been involved in the attack. “Kfir Brigade fighters eliminated approximately ten terrorists after they opened fire on them,” the IDF said.The incident came the same day Israel approved a major new settlement project in the occupied West Bank, drawing swift international criticism. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the planned construction in the highly sensitive E1 area “poses an existential threat to the two-state solution.” Britain, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority also condemned the decision, warning it would sever the West Bank and entrench division.","Hamas gunmen launched a rare raid on an Israel Defense Forces encampment in southern Gaza on Wednesday morning.

The fleas typically carry the bacteria from infected rodents such as squirrels and chipmunks.

US vice president JD Vance on Wednesday cautioned Elon Musk against pursuing a third political party after reports that the Tesla CEO is shelving plans to launch the “America Party” to focus on his companies. Vance argued Musk would have greater influence by working within the Republican Party alongside president Donald Trump ’s MAGA movement.""My advice to Elon would be to try to fix the Republican Party. Try to push it in your own way. Disagree with me all you want, disagree with the president of the United States, but don't pretend that you can make a big difference with a third party,"" Vance said in an exclusive interview on The Ingraham Angle of Fox News.""I think Elon would make a much bigger difference if he stayed loyal to President Trump's Republican Party, and if he had disagreements, express those disagreements from the inside as opposed from the outside,” he added.Musk had announced in July on his social media platform X that the new party would be formed to give people their “freedom” back in response to the two-party system.The billionaire entrepreneur split with Trump earlier in 2025 over the president’s “Big, Beautiful Bill,” which Musk argued would add trillions to the US national debt and undermine the department of government efficiency, where he had served in an advisory role.According to The Wall Street Journal, Musk has not ruled out reviving the idea of a new party.“I do think that it would be a huge mistake for Elon to go forward with a third party, and my argument to him is whether you like it or not, you are now perceived by the far left as on the side of the American right,” Vance told Fox News.“You believe in law and order, you believe in closed borders, you believe in economic growth and prosperity, you believe in making things in the United States of America. The idea that Elon is ever going to go back to being sort of in the middle, where Democrats and Republicans both like him, that's just not going to happen.

A fire aboard the USS New Orleans, a US Navy amphibious transport dock ship anchored off Okinawa, raged for nearly 12 hours before being brought under control early Thursday, leaving two sailors with minor injuries.The blaze began around 4 pm (local time) on Wednesday while the warship was anchored near the White Beach Naval Facility, the Navy’s 7th Fleet said in a statement. The New Orleans, commissioned in 2007, carries a crew of more than 360 sailors and is capable of transporting up to 800 troops.According to CNN, the US Navy confirmed that two sailors were treated for minor injuries in onboard medical facilities. The fire was declared out early Thursday, though Japan’s Coast Guard said efforts continued until after 9 am (local time) and that an investigation was underway to ensure the flames were fully extinguished.The New Orleans crew was assisted by firefighters from the USS San Diego, also stationed at White Beach, while the Japan Coast Guard, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, and other US Navy commands on Okinawa provided “critical support,” the Navy said.As per news agency AFP, four Japanese vessels, including coast guard, navy, and private contractor ships, spent the night spraying water on the blaze.Images broadcast by NHK showed tugboats dousing the ship’s bow with water.The cause of the fire remains under investigation. The Navy said the New Orleans crew will remain aboard the vessel.Naval analyst Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain, was quoted by CNN as saying that the scale of the blaze shows the service needs to revisit its prevention and firefighting protocols. He warned that damage could leave the ship inactive for 60 to 120 days. “A fire of that extent used to be rare on US Navy warships,” he said.The incident has revived memories of the 2020 disaster aboard the USS Bonhomme Richard, when a blaze in San Diego burned for more than four days, leaving the ship beyond repair. A subsequent Navy investigation cited systemic failures in maintenance, training, and oversight.The US maintains around 54,000 military personnel in Japan, most based in Okinawa.","Two sailors injured as USS New Orleans burns for 12 hours near Okinawa.

Sudden attack triggered chaos at meet

NEW DELHI: A man with a criminal history arrived at chief minister Rekha Gupta’s residence in Civil Lines in north Delhi and physically assaulted her during her weekly jan sunwai (public hearing) on Wednesday morning.The unarmed man approached the CM, hit her twice and attempted to drag her by her hair, all the while hurling expletives at her. The assailant was swiftly overpowered by security personnel.As Gupta fell down, the man appeared to pick up something from the floor and throw it at her but was prevented from doing so.Police said Rajesh Bhai Khimji Bhai Sakriya, a 41-year-old resident of Rajkot, Gujarat, had been booked on charges of attempted murder. Several agencies are jointly interrogating him to determine the motive for the brazen assault.An inquiry has also been ordered into the glaring security lapses around CM.The accused provided conflicting statements to the cops during questioning. Police also haven’t been able to pin down Sakriya’s motive for assaulting Gupta and suspect a conspiracy, based on his confession that he had conducted a recce of CM’s residence in Shalimar Bagh and had sent a video to an associate.Police are investigating this.Sakriya initially said he had come to seek the release of a jailed relative but later claimed to be a dog lover disturbed by the Supreme Court’s directive against stray dogs, a claim echoed by his mother. He has also claimed that in May, he observed a three-day fast in Ayodhya to highlight the plight of monkeys.He said if he was denied the chance to meet CM, he planned to sit on a hunger strike at Ramlila Maidan in the manner of Anna Hazare. He believed that seeing a dog sitting on a Shivling at a temple near his house recently was a divine sign to take up the cause of dogs.Delhi Police contacted their counterparts in Gujarat for confirmation of the information given by Sakriya, and a police team is being dispatched to that state. The accused, receiving medical attention till late on Wednesday, will be produced in court, where the cops are likely to seek 5-7 days of remand because he needs to be taken to Gujarat and other places.An FIR was registered at the Civil Lines police station under sections 109 (1) (attempted murder), 132 (assaulting or using criminal force to deter a public servant from discharging their duty) and 221 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.Participants at the jan sunwai narrated how the incident unfolded. Mukesh said that CM, as usual, was listening to people’s grievances. When it was Sakriya’s turn, he approached her with a piece of paper in his hand, and when within arm’s reach of her, he attacked her physically. The security personnel, including women cops, were caught off guard.Anjali added that the man was speaking in a normal manner before suddenly launching the attack, which she described as completely unprovoked. “He didn’t give any reason for his actions,” she claimed.Other witnesses said that as about 200 people milled around on the premises, Sakriya neared CM, and while she was reviewing the documents and listening to grievances, he suddenly became aggressive and physically attacked her. Shailender recalled seeing the man attacking CM and police personnel quickly intervening and escorting him away.Gupta was examined by a doctor at the residence and was later taken to hospital.","Rajesh Bhai Khimji Bhai Sakriya, a 41-year-old resident of Rajkot, Gujarat, has been booked on charges of attempted murder.

‘You’ve got to be yourself’: JD Vance hits out at Newsom for imitating ‘Trump-style’ posts; says Democrats need authenticity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/youve-got-to-be-yourself-jd-vance-hits-out-at-newsom-for-imitating-trump-style-posts-says-democrats-need-authenticity/articleshow/123422047.cms,"File photo: US Vice President JD Vance (right) and California Governor Gavin Newsom (Picture credit: AP)





US Vice President JD Vance on Wednesday ridiculed California Governor Gavin Newsom for imitating President Donald Trump ’s social media style, calling the approach inauthentic and unlikely to help Democrats win over voters.Speaking on Fox News’s The Ingraham Angle, Vance dismissed the strategy as misguided. “This idea that Gavin Newsom is somehow going to mimic Donald Trump’s style, I think that ignores the fundamental genius of President Trump’s political success, which is that he’s authentic,” Vance said.“He just is who he is,” Vance added. “You’ve got to be yourself. You’ve got to talk to people honestly about the issues.”Newsom, considered a potential 2028 Democratic presidential contender, has in recent weeks rolled out a new online strategy that mirrors Trump’s distinctive approach, long, capitalised rants, dismissive nicknames for rivals, boasts about his policies, and posts laced with exclamation marks.According to the New York Times, his press office X account, which once shared routine policy updates, has transformed into a parody of Trump’s Truth Social feed, branding him “AMERICA’S MOST FAVORITE GOVERNOR.”The change comes amid Democrats’ post-2024 election soul-searching, with some party figures arguing they need a sharper, Trump-like tone to compete. Vance, however, urged them to rethink. “Some free political advice from the president of the United States, stop sounding like crazy people,” he said.“Don’t be a crazy person. Be authentic. If the Democrats did that, they’d do a hell of a lot better.”Vance also pointed to what he called the success of Trump’s federal crime crackdown in Washington, DC, where the president declared a public safety emergency on 11 August.According to the vice president, violent crime dropped 35% and robberies fell 55% in just nine days. “These numbers highlight that law and order is a question of political will,” he told Fox News. “If you’ve got the political will to enforce the law, you can make even cities like DC safe again.”Newsom, for his part, has defended his mocking online style. He argued it is a deliberate attempt to expose Trump’s rhetoric by reflecting it back. “If you’ve got issues with what I’m putting out, you sure as hell should have concerns about what he’s putting out as president,” the governor recently said, as reported by the New York Times.His office has continued with the approach after seeing a surge in online engagement, with follower numbers climbing significantly this month.While some Democrats have embraced the strategy as “fighting fire with fire,” critics say it risks looking childish. Conservative commentator Tomi Lahren recently declared that Newsom had “embarrassed himself” to the point of being disqualified from higher office.Vance’s blunt message, however, was that no amount of theatrics can replace policy. “Gavin Newsom can mimic Donald Trump all that he wants to, but they’re still going to lose unless they get better policies that actually serve the American people”.",US Vice President JD Vance ridiculed California Governor Gavin Newsom for imitating President Donald Trump ’s social media style.

Mail-in voting trends





US President Donald Trump on Monday announced that he would lead a movement to abolish mail-in ballots and voting machines before the 2026 midterm elections, saying they fueled “massive voter fraud” and undermined confidence in the electoral process.In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said he planned to sign an executive order aimed at eliminating what he described as “highly inaccurate” and “controversial” voting machines, while pushing for traditional paper ballots with watermarks.According to Trump, paper ballots were faster, more reliable, and left “no doubt” about election results. “I am going to lead a movement to get rid of MAIL-IN BALLOTS, and also, while we’re at it, Highly ‘Inaccurate,’ Very Expensive, and Seriously Controversial VOTING MACHINES, which cost Ten Times more than accurate and sophisticated Watermark Paper,” he posted.He added that the effort, which he expected Democrats to oppose, would help bring “honesty” to the 2026 midterm elections. “We are now the only Country in the World that uses Mail-In Voting. All others gave it up because of the MASSIVE VOTER FRAUD ENCOUNTERED,” Trump wrote.Trump argued that states were merely “agents” of the federal government in counting and tabulating votes and insisted they must follow presidential directives “for the good of the country.”He accused Democrats of relying on mail-in voting to remain competitive due to their “radical left” policies. “With their HORRIBLE Radical Left policies, like Open Borders, Men Playing in Women’s Sports, Transgender and ‘WOKE’ for everyone, and so much more, Democrats are virtually Unelectable without using this completely disproven Mail-In SCAM,” Trump said.“Elections can never be honest with mail-in ballots or voting machines, and everybody knows it, especially the Democrats,” he added.Trump’s comments came days after his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Following the meeting, Trump said Putin agreed with him on ending mail-in balloting.""Vladimir Putin, smart guy, said you can't have an honest election with mail-in voting,"" Trump told Fox News after Friday's Alaska summit.Mail-in voting allows eligible voters to cast ballots through the postal system. It includes absentee ballots, used when voters cannot reach polling stations due to illness, travel, or other valid reasons, and mail-in ballots, which can be requested by any eligible voter in many states.A mail-in ballot refers to the actual ballot paper that voters complete and return by mail under this system.Although mail-in voting has long been part of the US election process, Trump has repeatedly attacked it since the 2020 presidential election, claiming it enabled widespread fraud.However, election officials and courts have found no evidence of large-scale fraud linked to mail-in ballots.Despite Trump’s opposition, several Republican-led states, including Florida, have embraced mail-in voting as a secure and convenient method of expanding voter participation. Trump himself voted by mail in previous elections and had encouraged his supporters to do the same for the 2024 presidential election.Mail-in ballots reached record highs in 2020, when states expanded options amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Usage declined in 2024, according to the US Election Assistance Commission.In the 2024 general election, more than two-thirds of voters cast ballots in person, while about three in 10 voted by mail. Every US state offers some form of absentee or mail-in ballot option, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.","US President Donald Trump announced he would lead a movement to abolish mail-in ballots and voting machines before the 2026 midterm elections.

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Monday said he would deploy 4.5 million members of the country’s militia in response to what he described as renewed threats from the United States, after Washington raised the bounty for his arrest and launched anti-drug operations in the Caribbean.""This week, I will activate a special plan with more than 4.5 million militiamen to ensure coverage of the entire national territory -- militias that are prepared, activated and armed,"" Maduro announced on state television.The militia, created by Maduro’s predecessor Hugo Chavez, is officially said to number about five million, though the real figure is believed to be lower. Venezuela’s overall population is around 30 million.Maduro denounced what he called ""the renewal of extravagant, bizarre, and outlandish threats"" from Washington.Earlier this month, the administration of US President Donald Trump doubled its reward to $50 million for Maduro’s capture. He faces US drug trafficking charges, with Washington accusing him of leading the Cartel de los Soles, a network it blames for large-scale cocaine smuggling. The Trump administration also announced sanctions against the group and the Venezuelan government last month.The US military has reportedly dispatched several vessels to the southern Caribbean as part of Trump’s campaign against Latin American drug cartels. ""We are also deployed throughout the Caribbean... in our sea, our property, Venezuelan territory,"" Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said.Though he did not directly reference the recent US actions, Maduro thanked allies for supporting Venezuela against what he called a ""rotten refrain"" of threats. He also urged the expansion of worker and peasant militias across all industries.""Rifles and missiles for the peasant force! To defend the territory, sovereignty, and peace of Venezuela,"" declared Maduro.","Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro says he will deploy 4.5 million members of the country’s militia in response to what he described as renewed threats from the United States.

A violent altercation between two students at Maryvale High School in Phoenix ended in tragedy on Tuesday, leaving one teenager dead and another injured, officials confirmed.Phoenix Police said officers were called to the campus, located near 59th Avenue and Osborn Road, shortly after 11:00 am (local time) following reports of a stabbing.“Officers arrived and learned there was a fight involving two male students,” the department stated.Both students were rushed to the hospital, where one later died, while the other is expected to survive, reported The New York Times.The school was initially placed under lockdown before authorities confirmed there was no ongoing threat to staff or students. Parents were asked to follow school instructions during the release process.Arizona Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Horne described the incident as “a terrible tragedy,” adding: “Schools must be safe places. The on-campus school safety officer responded immediately, rendered aid to the student and did his job well.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Tuesday said President Donald Trump had directed that the US-Mexico border wall be painted black, arguing that the dark surface would make it too hot for migrants to climb.Speaking at a press conference in Santa Teresa, New Mexico, Noem said, ""that is specifically at the request of the president, who understands that in the hot temperatures down here, when something is painted black, it gets even warmer, and it will make it even harder for people to climb.”“Now, if you look at the structure that’s behind me, it’s tall, which makes it very, very difficult to climb, almost impossible. It also goes deep into the ground, which would make it very difficult, if not impossible, to dig under. And today, we are also going to be painting it black"", she added.Trump had signed what he called a “big, beautiful bill” last month, allocating $165 billion to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The bulk of the funds were earmarked for strengthening the southern border and deporting migrants who were in the country illegally. Of this, $46.5 billion was dedicated to the construction of the new border wall, work on which had begun during Trump’s first term in the White House.Noem said the wall would also undergo a technological upgrade with the addition of “technology, cameras, sensors.”Reports of Trump’s plans to paint the border wall black had first surfaced during his earlier administration in 2020, when officials confirmed they were testing a black coating along certain sections.","Trump administration pushes for US-Mexico border makeover; paint walls black to deter migrants.

Yosemite National Park: Ranger fired for hanging transgender pride flag on El Capitan; justice department eyes charges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/yosemite-national-park-ranger-fired-for-hanging-transgender-pride-flag-on-el-capitan-justice-department-eyes-charges/articleshow/123399493.cms,"Ranger fired for hanging transgender pride flag on El Capitan





A ranger at Yosemite National Park has been dismissed after helping drape a giant transgender pride flag across El Capitan, sparking a wider crackdown on protests at the California landmark.Shannon “SJ” Joslin, a 35-year-old ranger and biologist who studies bats, confirmed they were terminated last week after unfurling the 66-foot-wide flag on 20 May with a group of climbers.The flag, which remained for around two hours, was removed voluntarily. In a letter of dismissal, Yosemite’s acting deputy superintendent said Joslin had “failed to demonstrate acceptable conduct” in their role as a federal employee, reported The New York Times.Joslin, who identifies as nonbinary, was quoted as saying by news agency AP that she had acted out of personal conviction amid policies from the Trump administration that “target trans people.” She added, “I hung the flag as a way to tell myself we’re safe in national parks. Instead, this firing says the opposite, that federal workers who don’t align with this administration must stay silent or be eliminated.”Two other rangers who joined the action have been placed on administrative leave pending investigation, Joslin said.Park officials confirmed the justice department is considering administrative and possible criminal action against both employees and visitors involved.Violators could face fines of up to $5,000 and jail terms of six months.The Park Service tightened rules a day after the incident, banning flags or banners larger than 15 square feet in 94% of the park. “Displaying signs, banners and flags outside of designated First Amendment areas detracts from the visitor experience,” said spokesperson Rachel Pawlitz, as cited by AP.Yosemite, she added, must balance free expression with the protection of wilderness and visitor safety.Advocates have condemned the firing. Environmentalist and drag performer Pattie Gonia, who joined in hanging the flag, was quoted by AP as she called Joslin “a respected pillar within the Yosemite community.”Jayson O’Neill from Save Our Parks claimed the decision was meant to intimidate workers from speaking out, while Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility is now representing Joslin.Demonstrations at El Capitan have become more frequent. Earlier this year, protesters displayed an inverted US flag to criticise Trump-era cuts to the Park Service workforce.Since Trump took office, the service has lost about 2,500 employees, with a further $900 million cut proposed for next year, according to AP.For Joslin, Yosemite was more than a workplace. “Everything I did was off the clock and had nothing to do with my role,” she was quoted as saying by The New York Times.“Yosemite is my whole life”, she added.","Shannon ""SJ"" Joslin, a 35-year-old ranger and biologist who studies bats, confirmed they were terminated last week.

Hurricane Erin’s outer bands brushed North Carolina’s Outer Banks, prompting Highway 12 closure

NHC warned of “life-threatening surf and currents,” storm surge and flooding across US East coast

Evacuations began in Outer Banks; NY, NJ closed beaches as Erin churned northward.





The National Hurricane Center (NHC) warned of “life-threatening surf and currents” along much of the US East coast as Hurricane Erin’s outer bands brushed North Carolina on Wednesday evening.A storm surge warning was issued for Cape Lookout to Duck, North Carolina, while a tropical storm warning was in effect from Beaufort Inlet to Chincoteague, Virginia, including the Pamlico and Albemarle sounds.The NHC advisory at 8 pm ET said hurricane-force winds extended outward up to 105 miles from the storm’s center, with tropical-storm-force winds reaching 265 miles.Hurricane Erin, now a Category 2 hurricane, was not forecast to make landfall in the US. However, ""storm surge will be accompanied by large waves, leading to significant beach erosion and overwash,"" has put beaches in the Bahamas, Bermuda, Atlantic Canada, and the US East Coast at risk.The National Weather Service cautioned that waves could exceed 10 feet in the region. Coastal flood warnings were in place for parts of Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, and along the bay south of the York River.Erin had earlier intensified to Category 5 on Saturday before weakening to Category 3 on Sunday morning. It regained strength later that day, with satellite data and a US Air Force Hurricane Hunter mission showing improved organization.Forecasters expected slow strengthening through Thursday night.North Carolina Governor Josh Stein declared a state of emergency on Tuesday to mobilise resources and assist evacuations in the Outer Banks. Low-lying tourist areas were already being cleared.Precautionary measures extended to the Northeast. New York Mayor Eric Adams announced all city beaches would remain closed for swimming on Wednesday and Thursday “due to dangerous riptides from Hurricane Erin.” New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy also urged residents and visitors to avoid the ocean, citing hazardous currents and high surf.On Tuesday, Erin’s slow northward movement had already unleashed rough surf and dangerous rip currents along the East Coast, triggering dozens of water rescues, swimming bans, and beach closures.","Hurricane Erin's outer bands brush North Carolina's Outer Banks.

"Gerrymandering row: Barack Obama backs Newsom’s redistricting plan in California; calls it a ‘smart, measured’ response to Texas",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/gerrymandering-row-barack-obama-backs-newsoms-redistricting-plan-in-california-calls-it-a-smart-measured-response-to-texas/articleshow/123421265.cms,"File photo: Former US President Barack Obama (Picture credit: AP)





Former US President Barack Obama has thrown his weight behind California Governor Gavin Newsom’s push to redraw House districts, calling the plan a “responsible” way to counter Republican efforts in Texas.Speaking at a Martha’s Vineyard fundraiser on Tuesday, Obama said he admired Newsom’s decision to link California’s proposed changes to Republican-led redistricting elsewhere.“He said this is going to be responsible. We’re not going to try to completely maximise it. We’re only going to do it if and when Texas and/or other Republican states begin to pull these manoeuvres,” Obama remarked, according to the New York Times.The former president, who raised $2 million for the National Democratic Redistricting Committee at the event, added that while he disliked gerrymandering,Democrats could not “unilaterally allow one of the two major parties to rig the game.” He warned, “If we don’t respond effectively, then this White House and Republican-controlled state governments all across the country, they will not stop, because they do not appear to believe in this idea of an inclusive, expansive democracy.”Newsom has proposed a November ballot measure, labelled Proposition 50, that would allow Democrats to bypass California’s independent redistricting commission and enact a party-drawn map.The plan, which he nicknamed the “Election Rigging Response Act,” would only be triggered if Texas or another Republican state pushes through mid-decade changes. If passed, it could reshape five districts currently held by Republicans, boosting Democrats in the 2026 midterms.Obama reinforced that his support was conditional. “Over the long term, we shouldn’t have political gerrymandering in America, just a fair fight between Republicans and Democrats based on who’s got better ideas,” he wrote separately on X on Wednesday.“But since Texas is taking direction from a partisan White House and gerrymandering in the middle of a decade to try and maintain the House despite their unpopular policies, I have tremendous respect for how Governor Newsom has approached this”, he further wrote.Newsom, widely seen as a possible 2028 presidential contender, thanked the former president on Wednesday. “Thank you President Obama for backing Proposition 50 and standing up for America’s democracy,” he posted on X.The redistricting clash has intensified since US President Donald Trump urged Texas leaders to redraw maps in a way that could eliminate five Democratic-held seats.Republican lawmakers in Texas approved the redrawn maps on Wednesday, intensifying the battle over control of the House. In response, Democrats in California, Illinois and New York are weighing counter-moves. Reacting to the Texas bill, Newsom posted on X: “It’s on. See you in November.”According to the LA Times, California lawmakers are expected to vote soon on whether to call the special election.Obama acknowledged the tension between his long-standing opposition to gerrymandering and his present stance.“I wanted just a fair fight … but California is one of the states that has the capacity to offset a large state like Texas,” he told donors, describing Newsom’s approach as a “smart, measured” solution tailored to “a very particular problem in a very particular moment in time.”","Former US President Barack Obama has thrown his weight behind California Governor Gavin Newsom's push to redraw House districts.

ODNI-shakeup: Trump administration orders major cuts to US intelligence office as 40% staff axed; $700 million budget slashed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/odni-shakeup-trump-administration-orders-major-cuts-to-us-intelligence-office-as-40-staff-axed-700-million-budget-slashed/articleshow/123420218.cms,"File photo: US director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard (Picture credit: AP)





The Trump administration has announced sweeping cuts to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), slashing its budget by over $700 million a year and reducing its workforce by more than 40%.As per news agency AP, director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard confirmed the restructuring on Wednesday, saying the changes were designed to end “the weaponisation of intelligence” and restore public trust.“Over the last 20 years, ODNI has become bloated and inefficient, and the intelligence community is rife with abuse of power, unauthorised leaks of classified intelligence, and politicised weaponisation of intelligence,” Gabbard said in a statement, as reported by AP.She added that her goal was to “provide objective, unbiased, timely intelligence” to the president and policymakers.According to Politico, the initiative, described by ODNI as “ODNI 2.0”, will eliminate hundreds of jobs and consolidate several offices, including the Foreign Malign Influence Centre, the Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center and the National Intelligence University.Some functions will be folded into other intelligence agencies or the National Defence University.According to Axios, ODNI staff have already been cut from around 2,000 in February, when Gabbard took charge, to about 1,500. Following this restructuring, the number will drop further to roughly 1,300.A senior official cited by Axios said that President Trump had even discussed the possibility of shutting down ODNI entirely, but Gabbard’s review concluded it still serves an “important role” in coordination.Among the most high-profile changes is the dismantling of the Foreign Malign Influence Centre, created in 2022 under President Biden to counter foreign disinformation campaigns. Gabbard claimed it had a “hyper-focus” on elections and had been used to suppress free speech.Emerson Brooking of the Atlantic Council, however, disputed that characterisation, saying the centre’s task was “supposed to solve for redundancy, not add to it,” AP reported.The overhaul has drawn sharply divided reactions in Congress. Senate Intelligence Committee chair Tom Cotton praised the move as a return to ODNI’s original mission. By contrast, Democrat Senator Mark Warner expressed doubts, citing Gabbard’s “track record of politicising intelligence,” while Representative Jim Himes called the cuts “a profound betrayal” of ODNI’s duty to protect Americans.Staff affected by the layoffs will receive 60 days’ notice, Axios reported.In total, Gabbard aims to cut $1.3 billion across all 18 US intelligence agencies in the coming years.","The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) has been restructured.

"US appeals court backs Trump admin: Halts TPS relief for 60,000 migrants; Nepal, Honduras in focus",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-appeals-court-backs-trump-admin-halts-tps-relief-for-60000-migrants-nepal-honduras-in-focus/articleshow/123419027.cms,"Representative image (agencies)





A US federal appeals court on Wednesday stayed a lower court’s order that had temporarily protected around 60,000 migrants from Honduras, Nicaragua, and Nepal from deportation. The decision, issued by the 9th US circuit court of appeals in San Francisco, supports the Trump administration’s move to end temporary protected status (TPS) for these groups, reported news agency AP.The three-judge panel, comprising appointees of Presidents Clinton, Bush, and Trump, granted the emergency stay, pausing the earlier July 31 ruling by US district judge Trina L Thompson. Her order had blocked the administration’s attempt to terminate TPS, citing a lack of ""objective review of the country conditions"" in places like Honduras and Nicaragua.TPS shields migrants from deportation and allows them to work legally in the US It can be extended by the secretary of homeland security in cases of war, natural disasters, or unsafe political conditions in a migrant’s home country.Secretary Kristi Noem had determined that conditions no longer justified TPS for 51,000 Hondurans and 3,000 Nicaraguans, with protections set to expire September 8. TPS for 7,000 Nepalis was scheduled to end August 5.The migrants had lived in the US for over two decades following Hurricane Mitch in 1998.Immigration advocates, including the national TPS Alliance, have challenged the decision, alleging it was politically driven and racially motivated. At a Tuesday hearing, US Deputy assistant attorney general Drew Ensign argued the government faced “irreparable harm” if blocked from implementing its policies.Responding to criticism, DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said, “TPS was never meant to be a de facto asylum system, yet that is how previous administrations have used it for decades.”The next hearing in the case is scheduled for November 18.The Trump administration has also moved to terminate TPS for migrants from several other countries, including Venezuela, Haiti, Ukraine, Afghanistan, and Cameroon. Some of those decisions are under litigation.","US appeals court stays lower court's order that protected 60,000 migrants from Honduras, Nicaragua, and Nepal from deportation.

Vice President JD Vance’s lunch event with national guard troops at Union Station on Wednesday was disrupted by a wave of protests, as demonstrators voiced opposition to the Trump administration’s security deployment in the capital.Vance, joined by defence secretary Pete Hegseth and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, met National Guard members - many from red states such as South Carolina, Ohio, and Mississippi - at a Shake Shack inside the station. The visit was intended as a gesture of appreciation for troops deployed to patrol Washington, DC, according to CNN.As Vance entered the venue, he was met with a mix of applause and boos. Protesters blocked from entering the second floor of the restaurant chanted “shame,” “this is our city,” and “we want the military out of our streets.” In response, others began chanting “USA.”When questioned by reporters during a brief press interaction, Vance dismissed the demonstrators as “crazy” and “communists.” Miller added, without evidence, that the protesters were “elderly white hippies” and “not part of the city,” as quoted by the news outlet.Referencing his past visit to Union Station with his children, Vance said, “They were being screamed at by violent vagrants, and it was scaring the hell out of my kids.”The visit highlighted ongoing tensions between DC residents and the Trump administration’s decision to deploy federal forces in the city. A Washington Post-Schar School poll earlier found that about 80% of DC residents oppose the move and the federal takeover of the city’s police department.Vance pushed back against those numbers, stating: “I’m highly skeptical that a majority of DC residents don’t want their city to have better public safety and more reasonable safety standards.”A college student at Union Station, who asked not to be named, told CNN, the troop presence felt “overwhelming.” She added, “I thought I had read that the crime rate in DC is actually going down?”While city officials and Democrats have raised similar points, Vance claimed crime is “massively underreported.” When asked for supporting data, he responded: “Just talk to a resident of this city.”Some media reports suggest that the department of justice is currently investigating whether DC’s metropolitan police department manipulated crime data.As Vance concluded the visit and returned to the main level, more boos followed. “I heard you buddy,” he responded to one protester. “This is the guy who thinks people don’t deserve law and order in their own community,” he said to Hegseth.Outside, another group of protesters gathered near parked National Guard vehicles. One sign read: “Criminals out of DC? Start with the Epstein files.”","DC Vice President JD Vance met with national guard troops at Union Station on Wednesday.

No Epstein grand jury transcript unsealing: Judge rejects DOJ’s request; testimony called ‘hearsay’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-epstein-grand-jury-transcript-unsealing-judge-rejects-dojs-request-testimony-called-hearsay/articleshow/123417285.cms,"Representative image (AP)





A federal judge in Manhattan has denied the US government's request to unseal grand jury transcripts related to the sex trafficking case against late financier Jeffrey Epstein , saying the records offer limited value compared to the wider case file already held by the department of justice, reported news agency AP.The ruling on Wednesday by US District Judge Richard Berman follows a similar decision by the judge who presided over the case of Ghislaine Maxwell , Epstein’s former associate, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence after being convicted of aiding Epstein’s abuse of underage girls.In his order, Berman noted that no victims testified before the grand jury and that the only witness was an FBI agent who had ""no direct knowledge"" of the alleged crimes. The agent’s testimony, described as mostly hearsay, was presented over two sessions on June 18 and July 2, 2019, alongside a PowerPoint presentation and a call log - all of which will remain sealed.Berman wrote, “the grand jury testimony is merely a hearsay snippet of Jeffrey Epstein’s alleged conduct,” adding that the motion to unseal the transcripts appeared to be a “diversion” from the more comprehensive case materials already in the government’s possession, as quoted by the agency.The decision comes amid increased scrutiny over the DOJ’s approach to transparency in the Epstein case. Last month, public backlash followed the justice department’s statement that it would not release additional documents from the investigation.“The government is the logical party to make comprehensive disclosure to the public of the Epstein file,” Berman said, criticising the limited nature of the records it sought to unseal.Meanwhile, Maxwell’s legal team has indicated willingness to cooperate with the House Oversight Committee, which is seeking her testimony as part of a Republican-led probe. However, her lawyers have requested immunity and access to questions in advance, which the committee has rejected. Chair James Comer said the panel was willing to delay her deposition until after her Supreme Court appeal, expected to be resolved in late September.",Federal judge in Manhattan has denied the US government's request to unseal grand jury transcripts related to the sex trafficking case against late financier Jeffrey Epstein.

Ten commandments in Texas schools blocked: Judge cites first amendment; public classrooms exempt for now,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ten-commandments-in-texas-schools-blocked-judge-cites-first-amendment-public-classrooms-exempt-for-now/articleshow/123416429.cms,"Representative image (AP)





A federal judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked Texas from enforcing a new law that would require public schools in Houston, Austin and other districts to display the Ten Commandments in every classroom, ruling that the measure likely violates the US Constitution, reported news agency AP.The ruling came in response to a preliminary injunction request filed by a coalition of families from different faith backgrounds - Christian, Jewish, Hindu, Unitarian Universalist and nonreligious - who argued that the mandate infringes on the First Amendment’s separation of church and state.US district judge Fred Biery, in his 55-page ruling, noted that displaying the religious text in classrooms could lead to students asking questions that teachers would feel obligated to answer.“Even though the Ten Commandments would not be affirmatively taught, the captive audience of students likely would have questions, which teachers would feel compelled to answer. That is what they do,” Biery wrote, as quoted by the agency.The temporary injunction prevents 11 school districts and their affiliates from implementing the law, which was set to take effect on September 1. The judge began his ruling by quoting the First Amendment and ended it with the word “Amen.”Texas is the largest state to attempt such a mandate, and the case is part of a broader legal battle likely to reach the US Supreme Court. A similar law in Louisiana was recently blocked by a federal appeals court, while a judge in Arkansas halted implementation in four districts.Texas attorney general Ken Paxton called the ruling “flawed” and confirmed plans to appeal. “The Ten Commandments are a cornerstone of our moral and legal heritage, and their presence in classrooms serves as a reminder of the values that guide responsible citizenship,” Paxton said in a statement, according to the agency.The families challenging the law are represented by the American civil liberties union, Americans united for the separation of church and state, and the freedom from religion foundation.“Today’s ruling is a major win that protects the constitutional right to religious freedom for Texas families of all backgrounds,” said Tommy Buser-Clancy, senior staff attorney at the ACLU of Texas.A broader lawsuit involving three Dallas-area districts and the state’s education commissioner is still pending in federal court.","A federal judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked Texas from enforcing a new law.

The judge noted that displaying the religious text in classrooms could lead to students asking questions that teachers would feel obligated to answer.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123416467,imgsize-1501215,width-400,resizemode-4/123416467.jpg"

Rescuers in Pakistan are struggling to recover bodies after flash floods triggered by relentless monsoon rains killed at least 321 people in the past 48 hours, officials told AFP on Saturday. Most casualties were reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where 307 people died as rivers burst their banks and houses collapsed.A video shared by RT.com showed the scale of destruction as torrents swept through towns and villages, leaving entire neighbourhoods in ruins. The floods, described by residents as “doomsday”, have left many communities cut off with relief efforts hampered by washed-out roads and ongoing rainfall.Authorities said around 2,000 rescue workers are engaged in operations across nine districts, but access remains severely restricted.“Heavy rainfall, landslides in several areas, and washed-out roads are causing significant challenges in delivering aid, particularly in transporting heavy machinery and ambulances,” Bilal Ahmed Faizi, spokesman for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s rescue agency, told AFP.“Due to road closures in most areas, rescue workers are travelling on foot to conduct operations in remote regions,” he added.Buner district has been hardest hit, recording at least 184 deaths. Other badly affected areas include Shangla, Mansehra, Swat, Bajaur and Battagram. The provincial government has declared these mountainous districts as disaster zones.Survivors have described terrifying scenes as torrents tore through homes without warning.“I heard a loud noise as if the mountain was sliding. I rushed outside and saw the entire area shaking, like it was the end of the world,” Azizullah told AFP. “The ground was trembling due to the force of the water, and it felt like death was staring me in the face.”Mass funerals were held across affected districts on Friday, with mourners grieving in front of rows of bodies covered by blankets. Local schoolteacher Saifullah Khan said: “We still have no clear idea who in this small village is alive and who is dead. I help retrieve the bodies of the children I taught, I keep wondering what kind of trial nature has imposed on these kids.”Officials warned the death toll is likely to rise further as dozens remain missing. Pakistan’s meteorological department has issued more rain alerts, warning that the intensity of the monsoon will worsen over the next two weeks.","Floods triggered by relentless monsoon rains have killed at least 321 people in Pakistan.
