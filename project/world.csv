Even if parents live apart or in different countries, it is important for the child to maintain a relationship with both. Denying such contact (by either parent) would deprive the child of the love, guidance, and emotional support,"" said a bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta.In Nov 2012, a man and woman got married, and had a child in Jan 2016. In 2017, the woman left the matrimonial home, and subsequently filed for divorce. In 2018, the man filed a petition for custody of the child.

Governor's absolute discretion on bills means negating people's will: West Bengal in Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/guvs-absolute-discretion-on-bills-means-negating-peoples-will-bengal-in-sc/articleshow/123685078.cms,"Amit Shah Vs Oppn Showdown: Bill To Remove PM, CMs Over Criminal Cases Sparks Big Lok Sabha Ruckus

Constitution mandates guv to act as soon as possible: Sibal

NEW DELHI: West Bengal on Wednesday warned that vesting governors with discretion to decide the fate of bills would jeopardise states' legislative functions, while Supreme Court-prescribed timeline for governors and the President would expedite transforming people's will into laws. This would not amount to amending the Constitution, it told the court.The TMC govt, through senior advocate Kapil Sibal, told a bench of CJI B R Gavai, and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar that the Constitution does not assign to the governor a dominating position or a significant role in either the legislative or executive functioning of a state.Sibal said if the governor is given unbridled discretion and he decides to simply sit on a bill for years, it will amount to negating the will of the people which is expressed through the bill by the elected representatives in the state legislature.An interpretation that gives the governor the executive power to withhold assent upends the entire constitutional scheme,"" senior advocate Kapil Sibal added. If the Centre's argument is accepted, then it would enable the governor under Article 200 to avoid communication, bypass reasoning, and ignore the primacy of legislature and act on his own, he said.If one goes by the Centre's argument that the governor's decision regarding a bill is not amenable to judicial review, then he can veto any bill, he said, adding that the governor would become a super-constitutional office, a concept wholly alien and incompatible with constitutionalism, responsible govt, and democracy.The reading in of a timeline for the governor or President to take a decision on a bill has become of paramount importance, the senior advocate added, given the distortions of keeping bills pending indefinitely in opposition-ruled states. Sibal said, ""A house cannot run if there is a marital discord. This is also true for the democratic institutions, where there must be harmony between legislature, executive and constitutional heads. ""He said the Constitution mandates the governor to act ""as soon as possible"", which attaches immediacy to the action of the governor. When that is being breached by keeping the bills pending for years without ascribing a reason, the SC would be preventing constitutional distortion by providing a timeline, Sibal said.""Thus, time limits prescribed by constitutional courts under the circumstances above are not to be equated with judicially enacted constitutional amendments,"" Sibal said, and termed the President's queries to the SC as ""vague and based on conjured up situations"" most of which do not warrant the SC's opinion.For Karnataka and Himachal Pradesh, senior advocates Gopal Subamanium and Anand Sharma echoed Sibal's arguments and said in the constitutional scheme for the federal structure of governance in India, the President or the governors are assigned no legislative or executive function.Subramanium said according to Dr B R Ambedkar, the states and Centre are to function as co-equals within their demarcated legislative arenas. ""If the governors, as agents of the Centre acting as titular heads of the states, would have unbridled power to stall bills enacted by state legislatures, then there would be a serious imbalance in the federal governance,"" he said.","West Bengal warns that vesting governors with discretion to decide the fate of bills would jeopardise states' legislative functions.

‘Insult To Every Mother’: PM Modi Tears Into Congress-RJD For Abusing His Late Mother

NEW DELHI: A day after PM Narendra Modi said Bihar will not pardon the opposition for “abusing my mother”, Congress asked him to focus on issues raised by the Vote Adhikar Yatra, instead of “crying” about extraneous matters.AICC spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said the person who hurled the expletives is in police custody and should be punished. But, she said, blaming Tejashwi Yadav, Rahul Gandhi and Congress for the incident is a distraction being created by Modi to shift the focus of the election campaign as he is rattled by the phenomenal success of the Yatra in Bihar.“To make a mother the focal point of electioneering is the worst kind of politics Modi has resorted to. The simple fact is that the PM follows multiple people on social media who abuse women and threaten them with rape, who have fictitious photographs of Sonia Gandhi and other women leaders. What does the PM have to say about it?” she asked.Shrinate said Modi had mocked as “jersey cow” and “Congress ki vidhwa” a leader who is a former president of Congress and a mother, and called Sunanda Pushkar a “50 crore ki girlfriend”, besides heckling Mamata Banerjee and campaigning for Prajwal Revanna who is accused of raping mothers.So, instead of “crying in public about his own issues”, Modi should talk about the concerns of the people, she said.Stating that the abuse incident took place when there were no big leaders on the stage, Shrinate said Modi’s bid to blame Rahul for it is unreasonable because he is a person with zero-tolerance for women being targetted. “When Smriti Irani lost in 2024, some people started ridiculing her. But Rahul had the political courage to come out and say that he does not like it, and that elections are won and lost. He did it for a woman who made a career out of abusing him and his mother. Is the PM questioning this person?” she wondered, adding the “rules have to be the same. The PM has consistently abused women”.“There is an economic crisis, tariffs, factories are shutting down, there are layoffs. And the PM who was laughing loudly in China suddenly returns to India and starts crying. Is this an electoral issue? The issues in Bihar are BJP’s bad governance of 20 years, false promises. Bihar will vote for jobs and equality, and against high prices and poor law and order,” she asserted.","AICC spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said the person who hurled the expletives is in police custody and should be punished.

Indore hospital rat infestation: Another new born girl dies; officials cite blood poisioning,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indore-hospital-rat-infestation-another-new-born-girl-dies-officials-cite-blood-poisioning/articleshow/123678873.cms,"NEW DELHI: Another new born girl, bitten by rats inside Indore's government-run Maharaja Yashwantrao Hospital (MYH), died on Wednesday. Officials said that the infant suffered septicemia or blood poisoning.According to MYH deputy superintendent Dr Jitendra Verma, the baby, who weighed only 1.60 kg, died during treatment as she was suffering from multiple congenital deformities, including an intestinal malformation.He added that the girl had undergone surgery a week ago, but her condition remained critical because of septicemia. She eventually succumbed to the infection, which occurs when bacteria enter the bloodstream and spread.As per the wishes of the girl’s family, no post-mortem was carried out and her body was handed over to them, the superintendent told PTI. He also claimed that the baby had been bitten by rats on two fingers of her left hand, leaving ‘mild scratches’.This comes barely a day after another newborn girl, also a victim of a rat attack at the same hospital, had died on Tuesday. Hospital officials said she too suffered from congenital deformities and died due to a ‘pneumonia infection’.Both babies were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the department dealing with newborn surgery. Following a preliminary probe into the rat-bite incidents, two nursing officers were suspended and the nursing superintendent was removed from her post.“The child was suffering from congenital anomalies. So, she was very weak. She was undergoing treatment of septicemia,” MGM Medical college dean Dr Arvind Ghanghoria told TOI. He further added that an autopsy had been performed and the report would further establish the cause of death.Doctors said the infant weighed only 1.2 kg at birth, had extremely low haemoglobin, and underdeveloped organs. The administration also disclosed that the baby’s parents had abandoned her after admission and never returned.The incident of rat bites, reported on Saturday and Sunday night, has exposed alarming negligence at one of central India’s largest government hospitals and triggered a swift response from authorities. On Tuesday, the state medical education department issued a show-cause notice to the dean of MGM Medical College, to which MY Hospital is affiliated.Madhya Pradesh deputy CM Rajendra Shukla on Wednesday said the government was treating the incident with utmost seriousness, admitting that pest control had not been carried out at the hospital.“The incident is very serious. The government has initiated action and suspended two staff members (nurses). Further action would be taken once the detailed investigation report is available. The pest control wasn’t carried out in the hospital,” he said.Shukla, 61, who also holds the health and family welfare portfolio, added that he has asked the principal secretary of the health department to submit a detailed report within a week.“The pest control and cleanliness drive was not done regularly, which is why MY Hospital has become a shelter for the rodents,” he was quoted as saying by IANS.The hospital further imposed a penalty of Rs 1 lakh on its pest control agency, Agile Company, warning that its memorandum of understanding could be cancelled. Superintendent Dr Ashok Yadav was directed to carry out immediate and comprehensive pest control across the facility.Meanwhile, a high-level six-member inquiry panel, comprising senior doctors, has been formed to investigate the incident and submit a report.The case drew the attention of the Madhya Pradesh Human Rights Commission (MPHRC). Acting chairperson Rajeev Kumar Tandon has taken suo motu cognisance and ordered an inquiry. The commission termed the incident a prima facie violation of human rights and instructed the hospital to file a report on the action taken within a month.","Indore's government-run Maharaja Yashwantrao Hospital (MYH) reports another death.

Pakistani cricketer Haider Ali, 24, has reportedly been cleared of rape charges in the UK after investigators found insufficient evidence. The Greater Manchester Police (GMP) and Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) have closed the case that began with his arrest on August 4 at the Spitfire County Cricket Ground in Kent, following accusations from a British-Pakistani woman.The woman had claimed she met Ali at a Manchester hotel on July 23, where the alleged incident took place. She said they met again on August 1 in Ashford before filing her complaint on August 4. Throughout the investigation, Ali maintained his innocence, stating he knew the woman as a friend and called the accusations ""shocking"" and ""false.""As per news reports, Ali's passport has been returned by the police, allowing him to leave the country at his discretion. The investigation's findings were strengthened by evidence showing the complainant had booked the hotel room under her name for what appeared to be a consensual meeting. The delayed filing of the complaint also weakened the case against Ali.During the investigation, Ali received legal representation from UK-based criminal law expert Barrister Moeen Khan. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) had temporarily suspended Ali following their code of conduct for players involved in criminal cases.With the case now dismissed, he can resume his cricket career.Ali, who made his international debut in 2020, has played in 35 T20 internationals and two ODIs for Pakistan, scoring 499 runs in the T20 format. While he can now return to cricket, the PCB is expected to conduct its own internal inquiry upon his return to Pakistan.His last international appearance was at the 2023 Asian Games.","Pakistani cricketer Haider Ali, 24, has reportedly been cleared of rape charges in the UK.

NAGPUR: Notorious Mumbai don-turned-neta Arun Gawli also called ‘Daddy' stepped out of Nagpur Central Prison on Wednesday after Supreme Court granted him bail in the 2007 murder case of Sena corporator Kamlakar Jamsandekar. After serving over 17 years in a high-security cell, including nine-and-half years in Nagpur Central Jail, the 76-year-old gangster shared a poignant wish with a senior jailor to reconnect with his family and play with his grandchildren, a stark contrast to his fearsome reputation in Mumbai's criminal underbelly.Gawli confided to one of the senior prison officials, his voice heavy with regret, that he missed watching his children grow and now wanted to spend time grandchildren. The emotional confession revealed a softer side of a man, who once ruled Dagdi Chawl in Byculla, offering a glimpse into his longing to reclaim a life lost to incarceration.The release was steeped in drama with Nagpur Police and prison guards orchestrating a fortified security to ensure Gawli's safe exit. Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) personnel and various intelligence units were present to pick up concealed clues.Dodging a throng of media waiting at the jail gates, Gawli was whisked away to Nagpur airport under heavy escort, arriving three hours early for his Mumbai-bound flight.Intelligence sources cited ongoing threats from Dawood Ibrahim 's D-Company, a feud rooted in the violent gang wars of the Eighties and Nineties, as the reason for his cautious departure. Surveillance was ramped up with police videographing the scene.Gawli's conviction in 2012 for Jamsandekar's murder, under the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA), marked a significant blow to his empire. Sentenced to life, he challenged the Bombay High Court's 2019 ruling upholding his conviction. On August 28, the Supreme Court granted him bail, citing his age and the 17 years already served, pending his appeal.Inside Nagpur Central Jail, Gawli was a model prisoner, adhering to protocols and earning commendations for discipline. He was granted 14–15 paroles and furloughs without incident. ""We recalled seeing Gawli spending time with religious scriptures,"" said a senior prison official. In 2018, he grabbed headlines by taking an exam on Gandhian philosophy, scoring 74 out of 80 marks, earning a certificate and khadi clothes — a surprising twist for a man synonymous with Mumbai's underworld.Gawli's release sparked speculation about his next move. Once a formidable figure who transitioned from crime to politics, serving as an MLA from Chinchpokli (2004–2009) under his Akhil Bharatiya Sena, Gawli's legacy is a complex tapestry of power, crime, and redemption. As he returns to Mumbai, questions swirl about whether ‘Daddy' will revive his political ambitions or embrace the quiet family life he craves.With security concerns looming, particularly from D-Company, his homecoming is anything but ordinary. Mumbai watches closely as the aging don steps into an uncertain future, balancing personal dreams with a past that refuses to fade.","Arun Gawli, 76, was released from Nagpur Central Prison on Wednesday.

VASAI: Authorities in Maharashtra have demolished a five-storey apartment block in Nalasopara, near Mumbai, after cracks were spotted in one of its pillars.The move came just days after another illegal building in the area collapsed, killing 17 people and injuring nine.The Vasai-Virar City Municipal Corporation (VVCMC) said 240 residents were evacuated from the Asifa Apartments and a neighbouring building before demolition began on Wednesday. Fire brigade teams and police officers monitored the operation to ensure nearby structures were not damaged.Assistant Municipal Commissioner Alka Khaire said the demolition was necessary for safety reasons. “We had already vacated the adjacent building yesterday and demolished the apartment today after a pillar was found exposed,” she said.The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has taken suo motu cognisance of last week’s collapse and issued notices to the Maharashtra Chief Secretary and Director General of Police. It has asked for a detailed report within two weeks.The commission noted that while the buildings were unauthorised and over a decade old, residents were still paying property taxes to the VVCMC, believing them to be legal.The collapse last week left dozens trapped under the rubble. Rescue teams, including the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), worked for 38 hours to pull survivors and recover bodies before the remains of the building were razed.Officials say several such unauthorised structures in the region pose a continuing risk, with many built close together without adequate safety clearances.","Authorities in Maharashtra have demolished a five-storey apartment block in Nalasopara, near Mumbai.

Perry Lee accuses Jay Cutler of negligence in DUI crash



Jay Cutler’s DUI case and criminal sentence



Former NFL quarterback Jay Cutler’s legal troubles have escalated. Days after a Tennessee judge sentenced him to four days in jail for a DUI case, the man he rear-ended in the October 2024 crash filed a civil lawsuit. The victim, identified as Perry Lee, is seeking more than $25,000 in damages, claiming the accident left him with medical bills, lasting pain, and diminished quality of life.According to court filings, Lee argues that Jay Cutler “failed to use reasonable and due care in the operation of the vehicle he was driving so as to avoid injury to other persons using the roadway, including [Lee].” His attorneys also allege Cutler was intoxicated when he struck Lee’s car in Franklin, Tennessee.Lee, a military veteran, says the crash caused ongoing pain, emotional suffering, and financial strain. “Our client is a veteran who was injured in a car crash due to the alleged negligence of another driver,” attorney John Morgan, founder of Morgan & Morgan, said in a statement. “His injuries from the crash cause him daily pain and have eroded his quality of life. We are seeking justice for him so he can get the care he needs and try to move forward with his life.The lawsuit also outlines claims for lost wages and reduced earning capacity. Lee’s legal team includes Morgan and attorney Sydney Pierce, who emphasized that Cutler’s intoxication was a critical factor in the collision.Cutler, 42, pleaded guilty to one count of misdemeanor DUI in late August as part of a plea deal. Prosecutors dropped his gun possession charge after he agreed to forfeit the weapon found in his vehicle. Along with his four-day jail sentence, Cutler was fined $350, ordered to complete DUI education classes, placed on one year of probation, and had his license revoked.The former Chicago Bears quarterback was arrested on October 17, 2024, after rear-ending Lee’s vehicle with his Dodge Ram truck. According to police, Cutler attempted to flee and even offered Lee $2,000 not to call authorities. Officers said he appeared visibly intoxicated, noting slurred speech, bloodshot eyes, and the smell of alcohol. A search of his truck revealed two firearms, including a loaded pistol.While Cutler has remained silent about the case, his ex-wife, Kristin Cavallari, briefly addressed it on her podcast. “I do, of course, wish Jay nothing but the best, and I do hope that he gets the help that he needs, but that’s the only thing I will be saying about it publicly,” she said.Also Read: Travis Hunter's NFL debut sparks debate as Jaguars push him to offense and critics call it a mistake Cutler is scheduled to begin serving his jail term on September 29.","Former NFL quarterback Jay Cutler was sentenced to four days in jail for a DUI case.

'Choosing merit over DEI': Trump admin to scrap Foreign Service Officer Test; will introduce new version,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/choosing-merit-over-dei-trump-admin-to-scrap-foreign-service-officer-test-will-introduce-new-version/articleshow/123688506.cms,"Donald Trump (AP)





The Donald Trump administration is scrapping the State Department’s current Foreign Service Officer Test (FSOT) and introducing a new version that it says would be strictly “merit-based,” in contrast to what it calls the existing “DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion)-riddled” system.“The Trump Administration is reforming how America recruits its diplomatic corps. That begins with a new Foreign Service Officer Test to select the best and brightest. We are choosing merit over DEI and affirmative action,” the State Department announced on its official X account, confirming an exclusive news report and sharing a link to it.The move is part of the Trump administration’s wider effort to restructure the agency, cut wasteful spending, and realign its priorities with US national interests.According to the report, the FSOT being phased out included questions on how often applicants “seek out activities with diverse ethnic and cultural groups” and whether they were likely to build relationships with people whose first language was not English.“Secretary Rubio, under President Trump’s leadership, is eliminating these distortions and restoring a system where talent—not affirmative action—determines opportunity.The new test will welcome patriots ready to serve, regardless of race, religion, sex, or ethnicity,” a senior agency official was quoted as saying.Another official argued that some questions in the previous exam were designed to “exclude ordinary Americans from the Foreign Service based on their upbringing.”Foreign Service officers are tasked with managing US relations with allies and partners around the world. The new test is part of a broader overhaul of the Foreign Service programme.In February, Trump, who began his second and final term the previous month, signed an executive order directing a revamp of the US diplomatic corps, and charging Rubio with building “an exceptional workforce of patriots.”","Donald Trump administration is scrapping the State Department’s current Foreign Service Officer Test (FSOT) The move is part of a wider effort to restructure the agency, cut wasteful spending, and realign its priorities with US national interests.

A 59-year-old British woman, wife of a Trump supporter, who has lived legally in the United States for more than three decades, is facing deportation after being detained at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport.Donna Hughes-Brown, originally from England, is the wife of James Brown, a Trump supporter who now says he regrets his vote. She was stopped on July 29 after returning from a holiday in Ireland, held in Chicago for five days, and then transferred to a detention facility in Kentucky.James Brown says he “100 per cent” regrets backing Trump, blaming the US president’s immigration purge for his wife’s case. “You look at the news, and they're not telling the truth about what's actually happening to a lot of legal immigrants. What's bad is that Trump is so demeaning to people, and he's so condescending and so retaliatory that people are afraid to say anything,” he said as quoted by Mirror.The case against Hughes-Brown relates to a misdemeanour from 2015, which her husband says was resolved years ago.Hughes-Brown has held a US green card for more than 37 years, renewing it twice, and has built her life around her four children and five grandchildren.Her bond hearing, delayed due to a clerical error, was later denied twice under new legislation. She remains in custody in Kentucky.Brown described his wife as active in her community, helping single mothers, maintaining free food “blessing boxes” and organising aid for families after Hurricane Helene last year.“We helped with supplies for Hurricane Helene. We do volunteer work all the time. We give to single mothers. We help out military families. We have a son who is a Marine, and this is our payment,” said Brown who himself served in the US Navy from 1985 to 2005.If deported, Hughes-Brown could be barred from returning to the US for 10 years.","Donna Hughes-Brown, originally from England, is the wife of James Brown, a Trump supporter.

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday said that America may have to suffer ""greatly"" and can be ""unbelievably poor again"" if it loses a Supreme Court case.Speaking to Reporters at the White House, Trump explained the consequences US may face if the Supreme Court didn't reverse the appeals court ruling from last week that found his tariffs were ""illegal.

Kim Jong-un brings a guest to Beijing: His daughter and potential heir,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/kim-jong-un-brings-a-guest-to-beijing-his-daughter-and-potential-heir/articleshow/123688471.cms,"



North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, travelled to Beijing this week to hobnob with the presidents of China and Russia, two of his nation's key allies. But he seems to have had another purpose for the trip: introducing his daughter as his potential successor.Kim Ju-ae, accompanied Kim to Beijing, where he joined leaders from more than 20 countries at a military parade on Wednesday. After the special train carrying Kim's entourage pulled into Beijing Railway Station on Tuesday, Ju-ae stood close to Kim as he was greeted by senior Chinese officials, as per photographs released by North Korean media. It is the first overseas trip that Ju-ae is known to have taken with Kim.Ju-ae, believed to be 12 years old, is the only child of Kim to have appeared in the North's state media, which refers to her as ""dear daughter"". Since late 2022, she has accompanied her father to military parades, weapons tests and other politically significant domestic events.South Korean analysts have said Kim appears to be grooming her as an heir, though they have also been careful not to jump to conclusions. The fact that he brought Ju-ae on his first trip to China in six years, and to a major gathering, is a significant new sign of her rising status, some said.Yang Moo-jin, a former president of Seoul-based University of North Korean Studies, said the girl was going through the ritual of ""introducing herself"" to the leadership of China, North Korea's most important ally. The scene at the Beijing station ""showed that she was being treated as No. 2 of North Korea not only at home but also abroad,"" said Cheong Seong-chang, a North Korea expert at Seoul-based Sejong Institute. ""By taking her to China, Kim Jong-un is sending a strong signal to the world that she is going to be his successor.""Although Kim was designated as the successor of his father, Kim Jong-il, at an early age, that status was kept secret until his father suffered a stroke in 2008. The gathering in Beijing highlighted Kim's transformation from a nuclear-armed international pariah into a global player. He has built up diplomatic leverage by growing closer with China amid the rivalry between Beijing and Washington, and by intervening in Russia's war against Ukraine.After the parade, Putin and Kim travelled in the Russian leader's car to the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, where they held talks for two and a half hours, according to Russian media. Putin thanked Kim for helping his war effort in Ukraine by sending troops and weapons. Kim said he cherished the new alliance treaty the two leaders signed last year in Pyongyang. North Korea considered helping Moscow ""a fraternal duty,"" Kim was quoted as saying by Russian news agency Tass. ""If there is anything we can do to help Russia, we will definitely do it,"" he added. nyt","Kim Jong-un travelled to Beijing to hobnob with the presidents of China and Russia, two of his nation's key allies.

Some users on X even claimed the White House was hiding his death.“I didn’t see that,” Trump said when Fox News’ Peter Doocy jokingly asked him, “How did you find out over the weekend that you were dead?” Trump smirked, replying: “That’s fake news. I didn’t do anything for two days and they say, ‘there must be something wrong with him.’ Biden wouldn’t do anything for months…”The White House has previously addressed Trump’s health concerns.In July, officials said discoloration on his hand came from “tissue irritation from frequent handshaking” and aspirin use for cardiovascular care.His swollen ankles were linked to chronic venous insufficiency, a benign condition caused by weakened leg veins. His physician, Dr Sean Barbabella, reassured in a letter that Trump “remains in excellent health.”Trump has long bragged about his stamina, even once sharing a meme portraying himself as Superman. But with the two oldest presidents in US history, Biden at 82 when he left office and Trump now 79, health rumors are under heavier scrutiny than ever.","The 79-year-old Republican had not scheduled public events or press briefings for nearly a week.

US president Donald Trump has a low approval rating, according to recent surveys by Gallup, Reuters/Ipsos and other pollsters.More than seven months into his presidency, the numbers show continued low approval, with Americans divided over his handling of the economy, immigration and the deployment of troops in Washington DC.Gallup’s August survey reported that 40% of Americans approve of Trump’s performance, while 56% disapprove. RealClearPolitics put his net approval margin at minus five points at the end of August, and The New York Times tracker showed minus eight.These figures keep Trump below the first-year ratings of earlier presidents such as Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan. Public approval stood at 49% for Joe Biden in August 2021, 36% for Donald Trump in August 2017, 53% for Barack Obama in August 2009, and 56% for George W Bush in August 2001. The highest in the list was George HW Bush, who recorded a massive 69% in August 1989.Public opinion has also been negative on key policy areas. A Reuters/Ipsos poll found only 38% of Americans supported his move to deploy the National Guard in Washington, while 46% opposed it. His immigration policies had 43% approval, and only 37% supported his handling of the economy.Trade has been another sticking point.

Maduro Warns Trump: ‘Rubio Leading U.S. To Bloodbath’ In Venezuela Power Showdown

Venezuelan government responds







President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced that US forces killed 11 “narcoterrorists” while carrying out a strike on a drug-carrying vessel linked to Venezuelan gangs. Trump alleged the gang was controlled by Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro.""Earlier this morning, on my Orders, US Military Forces conducted a kinetic strike against positively identified Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social, while sharing footage of the attack.""The strike occurred while the terrorists were at sea in International waters transporting illegal narcotics, heading to the United States. The strike resulted in 11 terrorists killed in action. No US Forces were harmed in this strike,” he said.The strike is part of broader US counter-narcotics efforts to strengthen maritime operations off Venezuela and combat threats from Latin American drug cartels. While thousands of US personnel are being deployed, officials have not indicated any plans for a land incursion into Venezuela.“Please let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America,” Trump added.Earlier on Wednesday while speaking at the Oval Office, Trump described the operation as part of ongoing counter-narcotics efforts in the southern Caribbean.“The US forces shot out a boat… a drug-carrying boat, lots of drugs in that boat,” he said. “So we took it out.”Secretary of state Marco Rubio also addressed the operation on X, calling it a lethal strike and noting that the vessel was operated by a “designated narco-terrorist organisation.” Rubio made the comments shortly before departing for Mexico and Ecuador to discuss drug cartels, regional security, and trade issues.Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro responded by deploying troops along the coast and the border with Colombia and urged citizens to join a civilian militia. Maduro has repeatedly claimed that the US is exaggerating Venezuela’s role in drug trafficking to remove him from power.He and other government officials have cited a United Nations report indicating that traffickers move only a small fraction of Colombia’s cocaine through Venezuela.On Monday, Maduro told reporters he “would constitutionally declare a republic in arms” if Venezuela were attacked by US forces deployed in the Caribbean.The Venezuelan government’s press office did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Trump’s announcement, and the Pentagon also declined to provide a statement.The latest UN World Drug Report shows that South American countries, including Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, reported increased cocaine seizures in 2022 compared with 2021, but Venezuela is not highlighted as a central hub of trafficking.","US President Donald Trump announced that US forces killed 11 ""narcoterrorists"" while carrying out a strike on a drug-carrying vessel linked to Venezuelan gangs.

Trump administration on Wednesday appealed to Supreme Court after a federal US appeals court ruled that the US president did not have the authority to impose sweeping tariffs on foreign imports.“That decision casts a pall of uncertainty upon ongoing foreign negotiations that the President has been pursuing through tariffs over the past five months, jeopardizing both already negotiated framework deals and ongoing negotiations,” the Trump administration argued in its appeal. “The stakes in this case could not be higher.”This comes as Donald Trump said that US might have to ""unwind"" trade deals it reached with the European Union, Japan and South Korea, among others, if it loses the case, and warned that a loss would cause the US ""to suffer so greatly.""""We made a deal with the European Union where they're paying us almost a trillion dollars. And you know what? They're happy. It's done. These deals are all done,"" he said. ""I guess we'd have to unwind them.""""Our country has a chance to be unbelievably rich again. It could also be unbelievably poor again. If we don't win that case, our country is going to suffer so greatly, so greatly,"" he added.An attorney for the small businesses rocked by the tariffs, Jeffrey Schwab with the Liberty Justice Center, said the stakes are also high for his clients.“These unlawful tariffs are inflicting serious harm on small businesses and jeopardizing their survival. We hope for a prompt resolution of this case for our clients,” he said.The ruling by the US court of appeals for the federal circuit in Washington, DC, covered two sets of tariffs - Trump’s “reciprocal” duties imposed in April as part of his trade war and another set announced in February against China, Canada and Mexico. It does not affect other tariffs Trump imposed under separate statutes, including those on steel and aluminum imports.In a 7-4 judgement the court observed: “The statute bestows significant authority on the President to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency, but none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax,” as quoted by Reuters.The decision also said Trump had exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).","US appeals court rules that Donald Trump did not have authority to impose sweeping tariffs on foreign imports.

Vice President JD Vance on Wednesday visited Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis to honour victims of last week’s mass shooting that left two children dead and 21 others injured. The solemn visit, however, was marked by protests across the street, where demonstrators waved pride flags and heckled him with chants of “do better” and “you’re a coward.”Vance, accompanied by his wife Usha, paused briefly at a statue of the Virgin Mary before entering the church, where he met families of victims. He later told reporters the experience was “heartbreaking but also gratifying,” noting that grieving parents shared stories of their children’s lives, hopes, and dreams.“I have never had a day that will stay with me like this one,” Vance said. “We should talk less about the shooter and more about these kids. Their lives were cut short, and that should be the focus.”Police identified the gunman as 23-year-old Robin Westman, who opened fire during a school Mass with three legally purchased firearms. Court records show Westman, born Robert, changed names in 2019. FBI Director Kash Patel confirmed the shooter’s identity.Protesters outside the church carried signs reading “protect kids not guns,” underscoring frustrations over gun violence. Conservative columnist Dustin Grage criticised the demonstration online, calling it “tone-deaf.”Vance, a practising Catholic, urged prayers for those still hospitalised and pledged to push for policies that address the root causes of such attacks. “One of the ways I’ll honour these parents is by being a better dad,” he said. “There are families who will never again get that chance.”","Vice President JD Vance visited Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis to honour victims of last week’s mass shooting that left two children dead and 21 others injured.

Harvard says cuts were payback

Trump denies retaliation









Harvard University scored a major legal victory on Wednesday after a federal judge blocked the Trump administration’s cuts to more than $2.6 billion in federal research grants.US district judge Allison Burroughs ruled that the administration’s actions amounted to illegal retaliation against the Ivy League school for rejecting White House demands to change its governance and policies.The ruling reverses a series of funding freezes that later became outright cuts as the Trump administration escalated its battle with Harvard. If it stands, the decision will restore hundreds of research projects that had lost federal funding, according to AP.Burroughs noted that the government had tied the freezes to Harvard’s handling of antisemitism on campus, but found little connection between the research grants and the university’s efforts to combat discrimination.“A review of the administrative record makes it difficult to conclude anything other than that Defendants used antisemitism as a smokescreen for a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault on this country's premier universities,” she wrote.Harvard’s lawsuit claims the Trump administration retaliated after the university rejected demands outlined in an April 11 letter from a federal antisemitism task force. The letter had called for sweeping changes in campus policies, academic programs, and admissions, citing concerns over alleged antisemitism and liberal bias.Harvard President Alan Garber said the university is committed to fighting antisemitism but emphasised that “no government should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue,"" as quoted by AP.The Trump administration denied retaliating against Harvard, arguing the grants were under review even before the April 11 letter was sent. Officials said they have the authority to cancel federal contracts for policy reasons. “It is the policy of the United States under the Trump Administration not to fund institutions that fail to adequately address antisemitism in their programs,” court filings stated.Beyond the courtroom, Harvard and federal officials are discussing a potential agreement that could restore access to federal funding. President Trump has said he wants Harvard to pay no less than $500 million, though no deal has been finalised. The administration has reached settlements with other universities, including Columbia and Brown.",Harvard University scored a major legal victory on Wednesday after a federal judge blocked the Trump administration’s cuts to more than $2.6 billion in federal research grants.

A 13-year-old girl was killed and three of her relatives were seriously injured when a small plane crashed in the Bighorn Mountains of northern Wyoming, authorities said Tuesday.The crash happened late Monday afternoon near Big Mountain, an 8,200-foot peak about 15 miles west of Sheridan. A medical service helicopter spotted the wreckage after being asked to fly over the area in Bighorn National Forest, according to the Sheridan county sheriff’s office, reported CBS News.Rescue crews established a command post off US Highway 14 and were flown to the site, where they found the girl dead and three survivors — an 11-year-old boy, a 53-year-old woman, and a 54-year-old man.Two of the injured were airlifted to a hospital in Billings, Montana, and another was taken to a hospital in Sheridan. The medical helicopter also carried the girl’s body back to the command post, where it was transferred to the county coroner.Federal officials said the downed aircraft was a Piper PA-28-180. The victims’ names have not been officially released, but thereported the family was from Boise. The newspaper identified the girl as Amelia Palmer and said her parents, Earl and Cindy Palmer, remained in critical condition, while her younger brother suffered only minor injuries.A GoFundMe campaign for the family had raised more than $25,000 as of Wednesday morning.The federal aviation administration and the national transportation safety board are investigating the cause of the crash. Sheridan county Sheriff Levi Dominguez praised the joint rescue effort, saying, “The coordinated effort between all of the rescuers, EMS, medical teams, and aircraft personnel was exceptional. This was, and still is, a very fluid scene. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims’ and their family,” as quoted by CBS News.","The crash happened late Monday afternoon near Big Mountain, an 8,200-foot peak about 15 miles west of Sheridan.

Chicago, Baltimore also in Trump’s sights





US President Donald Trump on Wednesday floated the idea of sending the National Guard to New Orleans, raising the prospect of expanding federal law enforcement operations to more US cities.“So we’re making a determination now,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office during a meeting with Polish President Karol Nawrocki.“Do we go to Chicago? Do we go to a place like New Orleans, where we have a great governor, Jeff Landry, who wants us to come in and straighten out a very nice section of this country that’s become quite, you know, quite tough, quite bad.” he said, as quoted by AP.The president said New Orleans’ crime problem could be fixed quickly.“So we’re going to be going to maybe Louisiana, and you have New Orleans, which has a crime problem. We’ll straighten that out in about two weeks,” Trump said. “It’ll take us two weeks, easier than DC”City leaders, however, rejected the idea. “Crime is down in New Orleans,” City Councilmember Oliver Thomas, also a mayoral candidate, said via text. “That would seem to be very political or a major overreaction!”Trump’s comments followed his earlier pledge, “We’re going in,"" about deploying the National Guard to Chicago and Baltimore.Local officials have firmly opposed the plan. Illinois governer JB Pritzker and Chicago mayor Brandon Johnson, along with Maryland governer Wes Moore and Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott, all said their cities do not want federal intervention.“We could straighten out Chicago. All they have to do is ask us to go into Chicago,” Trump said, as quoted by AP. “If we don’t have the support of some of these politicians, but I’ll tell you who is supporting us, the people of Chicago.”Trump often points to Washington, DC, as proof of success, calling it a “safe zone” after deploying federal agents and troops. The White House says more than 1,760 arrests have been made since August 7.But unlike DC, which is under federal authority, Trump’s plan to send forces into other Democratic-led cities would mark a major escalation. In Louisiana, the dynamic is different: New Orleans is controlled by Democrats, but the state is run by Republican governer Jeff Landry, who backs Trump’s idea.Washington mayor Muriel Bowser has said violent crime fell after Trump’s intervention, but argued the same results could have been achieved by adding more local police officers instead of deploying the National Guard.","US President Donald Trump floats the idea of sending the National Guard to New Orleans.

Final days and $6,000 ketamine deal





Jasveen Sangha, the dealer dubbed the “Ketamine Queen,” pleaded guilty Wednesday to supplying the ketamine that killed Friends star Matthew Perry.The 42-year-old US and UK citizen admitted to multiple federal charges that could carry a prison sentence of up to 65 years. Sangha pleaded guilty to one count of maintaining a drug-involved premises, three counts of ketamine distribution, and one count of distribution resulting in death.Prosecutors agreed to drop additional charges, including methamphetamine distribution unrelated to Perry’s case. Sentencing will be scheduled later, with prosecutors noting they will seek less than the maximum penalty.The plea marks the conclusion of a yearlong investigation announced after Perry’s Oct. 28, 2023 death. Sangha is the fifth and final defendant in the case to plead guilty, joining Dr Salvador Plasencia, Dr Mark Chavez, Perry’s assistant Kenneth Iwamasa, and friend Erik Fleming.Perry, 54, was found unresponsive in his Los Angeles home by Iwamasa. The medical examiner ruled ketamine the primary cause of death. Perry had been receiving ketamine legally through his doctor as an off-label treatment for depression but sought additional supplies.According to prosecutors, Perry paid Sangha $6,000 in cash for 25 vials of ketamine just four days before his death. Fleming had connected Perry with Sangha, calling her drugs “amazing” and saying she only dealt “with high end and celebs.” On the day Perry died, Sangha urged Fleming to delete their messages.Federal prosecutors described Sangha as a prolific supplier with wealthy and celebrity clients. On social media, she flaunted a lavish lifestyle, sharing photos from luxury destinations alongside influential figures.Sangha and Plasencia were the primary targets of the probe, with the other co-defendants providing testimony that helped build the case against them. None of the defendants have been sentenced.Perry’s long struggle with addiction dated back to his years on Friends, where he became a household name as Chandler Bing. He starred alongside Jennifer Aniston , Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, and David Schwimmer for 10 seasons from 1994 to 2004, cementing his place as one of television’s most beloved actors.","Jasveen Sangha, 42, pleaded guilty to multiple federal charges that could carry a prison sentence of up to 65 years.

After Russia's Threat, Poland Rules Out Military Deployment In Post-War Ukraine





US President Donald Trump on Wednesday offered to increase the US military presence in Poland during a meeting with Polish President Karol Nawrocki at the White House.Nawrocki, a nationalist historian and longtime Trump supporter, made Washington his first foreign visit since taking office. He had previously campaigned with Trump’s backing during Poland’s election and emphasised the importance of strengthening US-Poland ties.Standing alongside Nawrocki in the Oval Office, Trump said, as quoted by AFP, “We’ll put more there if they want. We’re with Poland all the way and we’ll help Poland protect itself.”The US president also commented on the war in Ukraine, calling it a “stupid war” but adding, “It’s going to get done. I thought ending it would have been much easier for me.”Nawrocki welcomed the offer, praising the US troop presence. He said it was “the first time in history” that Poland had been happy to host foreign troops and stressed Warsaw’s goal of continuing to increase its defense spending within Nato.The White House arranged a flyover of F-16 and F-35 jets to honor a Polish F-16 pilot who died last week while preparing for an air show.Deputy press secretary Anna Kelly said the “missing-man formation” was staged to “honor the memory of a brave Polish fighter pilot, whose life was tragically taken too soon, and capture the special relationship between our two countries,"" reported AFP.Poland, a key Nato and EU member, has been a major supporter of Ukraine since Russia’s 2022 invasion. The country serves as a critical transit hub for military and humanitarian aid and hosts thousands of US troops.Warsaw has largely been sidelined in Trump’s efforts to bring Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the negotiating table. On Wednesday, Putin vowed in Beijing to continue fighting if a peace deal cannot be reached, while Zelenskyy said he hoped to speak with Trump about potential additional sanctions against Russia.Nawrocki is also seeking US backing amid political tensions at home with Poland’s pro-EU government led by former European Council chief Donald Tusk.

A relatively unknown militant group, Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen (IuM) Pakistan, has claimed responsibility for the suicide car bomb attack on the Federal Constabulary Corps in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Bannu division on Tuesday.The outfit claimed the attack, which involved a car rigged with IED, killed more than two dozen members of the Frontier Corps but Pakistan acknowledged only six fatalities. Predictably, it blamed India for the attack. Pakistan claimed to have neutralised five operatives in a 12-hour counter operation but the group asserted that its 'fidayeen' blew themselves up after carrying out the attack. One of the suicide bombers was identified by the group as Abdul Aziz alias Qassid Mohajir, a resident of Afghanistan's Paktika province.The Pakistan army camp suffered massive destruction in the suicide attack.

""During early hours of Sept 2, Indian proxy 'Fitna al Khwarij' targeted the Federal Constabulary Headquarters in Bannu district. The Indian-sponsored Kharjis attempted to breach the perimeter security, however, their nefarious designs were swiftly foiled by vigilant and resolute response.In their desperation, the Kahrjis rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the perimeter wall. The suicide blast resulted in the partial collapse of the perimeter wall and damage to adjacent civilian infrastructure, inflicting injuries to three innocent civilians,"" ISPR said.IuM Pakistan, active since April, comprises fighters from outfits like Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, Lashkar-e-Islam and Jamaat-Ul-Ahrar. In the last few months, it has claimed multiple attacks in areas like North Waziristan, Miranshah and Tirah Valley. Its strikes included sniper, rocket launcher and grenade attacks, and ambushes on convoys, besides drone strikes.

We must store it,” he added.Pakistan’s Punjab is reeling under an intensifying flood crisis as the Chenab, Ravi, and Sutlej rivers swell to “exceptionally high” levels, inundating large areas.
