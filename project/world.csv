Apache AH-64e And Prachand Give India A Two-Front Air Strike Edge From Deserts To High Himalayas





US President Donald Trump pulled another hyperbole out of his MAGA hat on Tuesday, claiming that India had ordered 68 Apache attack helicopters from the United States, the delivery of which was so slow that Prime Minister Narendra Modi deferentially sought a meeting with him to raise concern over the delays.A review of official contracts, delivery records, deployment details and conversations with military and diplomatic sources shows that the claim does not align with facts: India ordered only 28 Apache helicopters in total, and as of December 2025, all of them have been delivered.The discrepancy reinforces a pattern critics have frequently noted in Trump’s public remarks where numbers are often inflated and timelines simplified to emphasise US leverage or personal involvement, like for instance in his persistent claim that he forced India and Pakistan into a truce with threat of tariffs. In this case, while delivery delays were real and did frustrate New Delhi, the scale described by Trump was not; neither was his claim that PM Modi asked “Sir, may I see you, please?” to raise the issue.In Trump’s recalls, everyone – even foreign leaders (except Putin and Xi Jinping) – is always calling him “sir.”India’s acquisition of the Boeing AH-64E Apache Guardian helicopters took place in two distinct phases, not one massive order.The first deal was signed in September 2015, during the final months of the Obama administration, when India signed an agreement to buy 22 Apaches for the Indian Air Force (IAF) in a contract worth about $2.2 billion. These helicopters were delivered on schedule, with the final units arriving by 2020 during the first Trump administration. They were inducted into two frontline squadrons and quickly became a central part of India’s attack helicopter capability.The second deal was signed in February 2020 during Trump’s visit to India. This follow-on contract, valued between $600 million and $800 million, covered six Apaches for the Indian Army Aviation Corps. This is the order that experienced repeated delays and became a talking point in US and Indian political discussions, including PM Modi flagging it during his visit to the White House in February 2025, one of many topics that were on the agenda. Combined, both deals amount to 28 helicopters—less than half of the figure cited by Trump.While the Air Force’s Apaches arrived on time, delivered at the end of Trump’s first term, the Army’s six helicopters were significantly delayed. Deliveries were initially scheduled to begin in early 2024. Instead, the first batch reached India only in July 2025—about 15 months late. The final three helicopters arrived in December 2025, completing the order nearly two years behind schedule.Several factors contributed to the delays. Boeing’s Apache production line in Mesa, Arizona, was affected by post-pandemic supply chain disruptions, including shortages of engines, gearboxes, and specialised electronics. In addition, India reportedly had a relatively low priority ranking within the US defence priorities and allocations system (DPAS) in 2024, meaning other customers—including the US. Army—were ahead in the queue for certain components.There were also technical and logistical complications. Boeing briefly paused some Apache deliveries worldwide due to electrical and power-generation concerns that required additional safety testing. In a final twist, the last batch bound for India in November 2025 had to turn back mid-flight after Turkey denied overflight clearance to the Antonov-124 transport aircraft carrying the helicopters, adding several more weeks of delay.Also read: 'If they don't help on Russian oil issue...'; Donald Trump's new tariff warning to India; praises PM Modi These genuine frustrations likely form the basis of Trump’s comments, but the numerical exaggeration undermines their credibility. Is it possible that Trump may have conflated two separate Indian helicopter purchases from Boeing: the AH-64E Apache attack helicopter and the CH-47F Chinook heavy-lift helicopter? Both deals were signed around the same time, both involved Boeing (for which Trump claimed to be the all-time best salesman), but they still add up to only 43, since India ordered 15 Chinooks, all of which have been delivered between 2019 and 2020. There is no record in India’s ministry of defence or US foreign, military Sales (FMS) notifications of any additional Apache orders beyond the 28 units. While the Army originally projected a requirement for 39 Apaches, no new contracts have been signed.In fact, despite the Apache’s formidable firepower, India’s experience with dodgy US supply chains issues and increasingly mercurial strategic shifts vis-a-vis China and Pakistan is such that it is now peeling away from American, and for that matter, any foreign dependency. Instead, New Delhi is increasingly prioritising indigenous solutions under its “Make in India” policy. In this case, it is leaning on the HAL Prachand Light Combat Helicopter. A lighter chopper optimized for extreme altitudes, Prachand can operate where the heavier Apache struggles, including at heights above 20,000 feet like in Siachen. India plans to induct 156 Prachand helicopters across the Army and Air Force, gradually reducing reliance on foreign attack helicopters.The emerging strategy is clear: Apaches will remain India’s heavy strike platforms in plains and desert sectors, but the future of India’s rotary-wing combat power will be increasingly domestic. Trump’s claim of 68 helicopters may have overstated the scale, but it has inadvertently highlighted why India is determined to avoid dealing with a maverick.","US President Donald Trump pulled another hyperbole out of his MAGA hat on Tuesday.

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Tuesday said the safety of people in Venezuela is India’s primary concern amid the crisis following US military operations in the country and the capture of President Nicolas Maduro and his wife.Speaking in Luxembourg, Jaishankar urged all parties involved in the crisis to sit down and reach a position that serves the well-being of the people of Venezuela.“I think we put out a statement yesterday, so I would urge you to look at it. Obviously, what happened—if I can sum up the statement—is that we are concerned about the developments, but we would really urge all the parties involved to now sit down and come to a position which is in the interest of the well-being and safety of the people of Venezuela, because at the end of the day, that is our concern,” Jaishankar said.“We would want Venezuela as a country with whom, over many, many years, we’ve had very good relations. So we would like the people to come out well, whatever the direction of events,” he added.This comes after Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured in Caracas and flown out of the country on Saturday in a joint operation involving intelligence agencies and US law enforcement.Subsequently, the ministry of external affairs reiterated India’s support for the safety and well-being of people in Venezuela as the situation in the country remains tense amid US strikes.“Recent developments in Venezuela are a matter of deep concern. We are closely monitoring the evolving situation,” the MEA said in a statement.“We call upon all concerned to address issues peacefully through dialogue, ensuring peace and stability in the region. The Embassy of India in Caracas is in contact with members of the Indian community and will continue to provide all possible assistance,” it added.","Jaishankar urges all parties involved in the crisis to sit down and reach a position that serves the well-being of the people of Venezuela.

Intellectually disabled woman’s testimony gets rapist 10-year RI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/intellectually-disabled-womans-testimony-gets-rapist-10-year-ri/articleshow/126384966.cms,"MUMBAI: Relying on Supreme Court’s observation that the testimony of a person with a disability can’t be considered weak or inferior only because they interact with the world in a different manner, a sessions court recently sentenced a 35-year-old salon worker to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment for abduction and rape of a woman with moderate intellectual disability in 2019, marking a rare conviction under Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act.Calling the victim a “sterling witness”, judge Surekha A Sinha found the man guilty on multiple counts, including rape under IPC. He was given one year in jail under Section 92(b) of Disabilities Act (assaulting or using force against a person with a disability). The sentences are to run concurrently.Psychiatrists deposed that while the woman was 25 years old physically, her social age was around seven years and two months, with an IQ of 36.According to the prosecution, on April 29, 2019, the survivor’s mother noticed that she had gone missing after the family returned from voting in the Lok Sabha polls. When the woman returned home shortly after, she was in tears and revealed her assault. She said while playing in a nearby lane, the accused caught her hand and forcibly took her to the mezzanine floor of his residence. There, he threatened her with a knife, gagged her with a pillow, and sexually assaulted her.To destroy evidence, she said, the man washed her with soap.During trial, special public prosecutor Geeta Sharma examined 14 witnesses. While forensic reports were inconclusive — a result the prosecution attributed to the accused washing the victim after the assault — medical experts provided critical testimony. Doctors confirmed that the victim had suffered physical trauma consistent with sexual assault.The defence said the case was built on hearsay and cited minor discrepancies in the testimony. The judge rejected these, saying the testimony of a person with a disability must be treated with “utmost sensitivity”. “Minor discrepancies and contradictions are not fatal to the case of prosecution. Courts cannot cling to a fossil formula and insist upon corroboration even if, taken as a whole, the case spoken of by the victim of sex crime strikes the judicial mind as probable. ”","A sessions court recently sentenced a 35-year-old salon worker to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment for abduction and rape of a woman with moderate intellectual disability.

CHANDIGARH: Punjab and Haryana HC denied bail to Gurmukh Singh — son of former Akal Takht jathedar Jasbir Singh Rode — and Gurmej Singh in a narco-terrorism case related to smuggling of arms, explosives (including tiffin bombs), and narcotics from Pakistan via drones to fund terror activities in Punjab and other parts of India.A division bench of Justice Gurvinder Singh Gill and Justice Ramesh Kumari said sponsoring terrorism was an “expensive affair” and the charge was of heroin being smuggled into the country, along with arms and ammunition, to fund terror activities.“Facts brought on record by NIA , prima facie, prove the involvement of appellants in terror activities. Trial is in progress. Since they have links with persons across the border, who fund their activities, there are also chances of their absconding from trial,” HC said. It ordered an expeditious trial and directed police and prosecution to complete evidence in a timely manner.NIA’s prime allegations are that the accused were part of a larger conspiracy involving “receipt, concealment, and distribution of arms, explosives, and terror funds intended to revive militancy in Punjab”. The agency alleged multiple consignments were collected between June and Aug 2021, concealed at locations across Punjab that were shared through encrypted messaging platforms.The agency claimed to have recovered grenades, detonators, pistols, cartridges, explosive materials, large sums of cash, multiple passports, and vehicles from Gurmukh.Gurmukh’s counsel argued he was falsely implicated due to his family background and political reasons, and claimed there was no direct recovery from his possession. NIA asserted that evidence clearly pointed to his role in facilitating terror activities.The agency submitted the appellants were allegedly in contact with Lakhbir Singh Rode alias Baba, a declared terrorist and chief of a banned organisation.","Punjab and Haryana HC denied bail to Gurmukh Singh, son of former Akal Takht jathedar Jasbir Singh Rode.

NEW DELHI: Linking the mounting trade tensions between India and United States with the capture of Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro in the CIA-led operation, Maharashtra's former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan on Tuesday asked: ""Will Trump kidnap our Prime Minister?""Chavan said the central government has been making an effort to diversify the supply source to give a cushion to the exporters hit by the US President Donald Trump's 50 percent tariff on India.""With a 50 percent tariff, trade is simply not possible. In effect, this amounts to blocking India–US trade, especially exports from India to the United States. Since a direct ban cannot be imposed, tariffs have been used as a tool to stop trade. India will have to bear this,"" Chavan said in an interview to news agency IANS.He further said: ""The profits that our people earlier earned from exports to the US will no longer be available. We will have to look for alternative markets, and efforts in that direction are already under way"".""The question then is: What next? Will something like what happened in Venezuela happen in India? Will Mr. Trump kidnap our Prime Minister?"" Chavan asked.Criticising Chavan over his remark, BJP's national spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari said: Congress sinks to a new low every day. Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan shamelessly comparing India’s situation with Venezuela. By asking whether “what happened in Venezuela can happen in India”, Congress is making its anti-India mindset clear. Rahul Gandhi wants chaos in Bharat. Rahul Gandhi is seeking foreign intervention in Bharat’s affairs!""Earlier in the day, Chavan criticised the government for not taking a stand after the US captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, saying such an incident could also happen to India.“Whatever has happened in Venezuela is against the UN Charter. An elected president has been kidnapped. It's a very grave concern that it could happen to any other country tomorrow. Tomorrow it can happen to India,” Chavan said.“India has not spoken as usual, not taken a stand on the Venezuela matter. Russia and China have taken a stand and criticised what America has done. The same thing happened in the Ukraine war. We did not take any side. We did not take a stand on the Israel-Hamas matter, and now here we are, so scared of Americans that we are not even trying to criticise what has happened,” he added.However, the ministry of external affairs on Sunday reiterated India’s support for the safety and well-being of people in Venezuela as the situation in the country remains tense after the US strikes.""Recent developments in Venezuela are a matter of deep concern. We are closely monitoring the evolving situation,"" the MEA said in a statement.Trump on Monday issued a fresh tariff warning to India, saying Washington could raise duties on New Delhi if it does not “help on Russian oil issue,” directly linking the threat to the ongoing Russia–Ukraine war.“We could raise tariffs on India if they don't have help on Russian oil issue,” said US President Trump, quoted by Reuters.US President Donald Trump added, ""They wanted to make me happy, basically... PM Modi's a very good man. He's a good guy. He knew I was not happy. It was important to make me happy. They do trade, and we can raise tariffs on them very quickly...""Trump was referring to India’s continued oil trade with Russia, a point his administration has repeatedly opposed, and which he had cited as the basis for doubling tariffs on India to 50% in August 2025.India is already facing the 50% tariff imposed by Trump, who has been sharply critical of New Delhi’s ties with Moscow and has alleged India of strengthening Russia in the Ukraine war by purchasing Russian crude.",Prithviraj Chavan said the central government has been making an effort to diversify the supply source to give a cushion to the exporters hit by the US President Donald Trump's 50 percent tariff on India.

‘Vote Theft In Bengal’: TMC MP Abhishek Banerjee Slams ECI Over SIR, BJP Fires Back

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Tuesday told the Supreme Court that it has both the power and constitutional competence to carry out a Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, arguing that it is duty-bound to ensure that no foreigners are included in voter lists.The submissions were made by senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, appearing for the EC, before a bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi.The bench resumed final hearings in a batch of petitions challenging the EC’s decision to undertake the SIR exercise in several states, including Bihar. The petitions raise constitutional questions on the scope of the poll panel’s powers, citizenship, and the right to vote.Dwivedi argued that the Constitution makes citizenship a foundational requirement for holding public office. Citing provisions such as Article 124(3), which governs the appointment of Supreme Court and high court judges, he said all key constitutional functionaries across the three organs of the State must be Indian citizens.He added that citizenship is also a prerequisite for holding offices such as president, vice president and prime minister.“All vital appointments ... no appointments can be made unless the person is a citizen, so our Constitution is citizen-centric predominantly,” Dwivedi said, according to news agency PTI.Referring to the constitutional scheme, he said, “The (constitutional) article, when it says citizens, that is something which has to be inquired by the competent authority. What should be the nature, summary etc., that is a different question.... There is a constitutional duty to ensure that on the electoral roll, there should not be any foreigners.”Dwivedi told the court that the Election Commission cannot be expected to respond to political rhetoric.“I am not commenting on the political parties, as the Election Commission, our duty is that no foreigner should be there.... It is to be seen that the power is there and the competence is there,” he said.Resuming his arguments, Dwivedi framed what he described as the central constitutional issue: whether Article 324, which grants the EC powers of superintendence, direction and control over elections, is completely displaced by statutory provisions or whether its application must be examined on a case-by-case basis.He submitted that Articles 324, 325 and 326 of the Constitution, read together with Section 16 of the Representation of the People Act, do not bar the EC from exercising its authority in revising electoral rolls.“The field is not totally foreclosed,” he said, asserting that the Commission retains constitutional competence to ensure the purity of voter lists.Tracing the evolution of voting rights, Dwivedi took the bench through colonial-era electoral practices, beginning with the introduction of separate communal electorates in 1909 and the limited franchise under the Government of India Acts, when only about 15 per cent of the population had voting rights. He argued that the expansion of the franchise was a central goal of India’s freedom struggle.“Not only Article 326, but the entire Constitution, when it speaks of a democratic republic, reflects an intention to create a citizen-centric polity,” he said.Addressing concerns that the SIR exercise could resemble a parallel citizenship determination similar to the National Register of Citizens (NRC), Dwivedi stressed that the two serve fundamentally different purposes.“The NRC includes all persons, whereas the electoral roll includes only citizens above the age of 18,” he said, adding that persons of unsound mind or otherwise disqualified are also excluded from voter lists.“On the face of it, the electoral roll is not like the NRC,” he said, reiterating that Article 326 permits only citizens to vote and that citizenship must be determined by a competent authority.Even if “10 or thousands” of foreigners are found on the electoral rolls, they must be removed, Dwivedi said, clarifying that the EC is not making political judgments but fulfilling its constitutional obligation.The senior advocate is scheduled to resume his arguments on Thursday, January 8.Earlier, the bench had questioned whether the EC is barred from conducting inquiries in cases of doubtful citizenship and whether such an inquisitorial process falls outside its constitutional mandate.","The Supreme Court resumes final hearings in a batch of petitions challenging the EC’s decision to undertake the SIR exercise.

Ambala man arrested for allegedly spying on Air Force; under investigation



NEW DELHI: In two separate cases of alleged espionage reported within 24 hours, authorities in Punjab and Haryana have arrested a 15-year-old boy from Pathankot and a contractor from Ambala for allegedly sharing sensitive defence-related information with Pakistan-linked handlers. Police in both states said the accused were in contact with individuals across the border and had passed on details connected to key security installations.A 15-year-old boy from Pathankot has been arrested for allegedly sharing information related to national security with Pakistan's ISI , terror outfits, and Pakistan military officers, Punjab Police said on Tuesday.Police identified the juvenile as Sanjeev Kumar . According to officials, he was tricked by Pakistani handlers on social media. Police said he believed that his father had been murdered, which made him emotionally vulnerable.SSP Pathankot Daljinder Singh Dhillon said, ""The police have arrested Sanjeev Kumar, aged 15, after receiving information that he had been supplying information related to the security of our nation to the frontal organisations of terror agencies, ISI, and Pakistan military officers.""He added that the boy was drawn in by Pakistani accounts online.""He fell into the trap of Pakistani agencies through social media, as he was suspicious that his father had been murdered, which affected him mentally. However, the investigation did not reveal any such evidence,"" Dhillon said.According to police, Sanjeev had sent videos of several sensitive locations and had been in contact with gangsters based in Pakistan who run terror modules. ""He had been in contact with Pakistan’s terror organisations for almost a year,"" the SSP said.Police are investigating how much information he shared and who he was in contact with. The boy is currently in custody, and further action will be taken based on the investigation.In an another incident in neighbouring state -- Haryana, another man in Ambala was held for allegedly spying on Air Force, as confirmed by DSP Crime on Tuesday.DSP Crime Virendra Kumar said the accused, Sunil alias Sunny, had been a contractor handling repair work at an Air Force station since 2020.“The police had information that he was providing details about our defence area, specifically the Air Force. His mobile was seized and several suspicious things emerged from it,” Kumar said.The officer added that Sunil had been in contact with a woman who allegedly asked for information, which he passed on. “According to his device, he used to send information to a neighbouring country, which we can call an enemy country. But this is his version. Investigation is ongoing,” he said.Sunil is married with two children and is currently on four days of remand. The probe is in its initial stages.","A 15-year-old boy from Pathankot has been arrested for allegedly sharing information related to national security with Pakistan's ISI, terror outfits, and Pakistan military officers.

"Fearless judges bedrock of judiciary, can’t be penalised for error of judgment: Supreme Court",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fearless-judges-bedrock-of-judiciary-cant-be-penalised-for-error-of-judgment-supreme-court/articleshow/126363824.cms,"Probes based on motivated complaints will hit functioning of trial judiciary : SC



NEW DELHI: Observing that a fearless judge is the bedrock of an independent judiciary, Supreme Court on Monday held that disciplinary proceedings can’t be initiated against a judge for an error of judgment on their part. It also expressed concern over frivolous complaints being filed against members of judiciary, which lead to trial court judges treading with trepidation with regard to bail matters.Coming to the rescue of a trial judge whose services were terminated by Madhya Pradesh high court for an error of judgment in grant of bail to an accused, a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and K V Viswanathan said it is not the correctness of the verdict but the conduct of the judicial officer in question which is determinative. While HC must immediately intervene when an allegation against a judge is true “to weed out black sheep sullying the fair name of the judiciary”, it must also defend a judge facing false and anonymous complaints, the court said. “A fearless judge is the bedrock of an independent judiciary, as much as an independent judiciary itself is the foundation on which rule of law rests.”A judicial officer is tasked with the onerous duty of deciding cases.Invariably, one party to the case would lose and go back unhappy. Disgruntled elements amongst them, wanting to settle scores, may raise frivolous allegations. The trial judiciary also has tremendous work pressure and works under trying working conditions. Large number of cases are listed in a day and most of the judicial officers give their very best while discharging their duties,” Justice Viswanathan, who penned the judgment, said.The functioning of trial judiciary would be seriously impacted and fearless discharge of duties would become a casualty if inquiries are launched on ill-conceived or motivated complaints, the court said, pointing out that a wrong decision can be a bona fide error of judgment.“It should be ensured that only because an order is wrong or there is an error of judgment, without anything more, a judicial officer is not put through the ordeal of a disciplinary proceeding or a prosecution... When false allegations fly thick and fast, the judicial officers cannot react. Here is where the high court, which is vested with the supervisory control, has to exercise great caution and circumspection,” the bench said while quashing the HC order and directing that the judicial officer be reinstated with back wages.The court said there was no merit in the allegation against the judge and the integrity of a judge cannot be questioned merely because of an erroneous order. “It will be a dangerous proposition to hold that judgments and orders which do not refer expressly to statutory provisions are per se dishonest judgments.”Justice Pardiwala said that initiation of departmental proceedings on mere suspicion is one of the primary reasons trial court judges are reluctant to exercise their discretion for grant of bail, resulting in HCs and SC being flooded with bail pleas. “It should not happen that because of the lurking fear in the mind of a trial court judge, of some administrative action being taken, that even in a deserving case, well within the principles of law, bail is declined. .. Over a period of time, the trial court judges have exhibited tendency to shirk from their solemn judicial function and responsibility when it comes to exercising discretion in matters relating to bail,” he said.","Supreme Court held that disciplinary proceedings can’t be initiated against a judge for an error of judgment on their part. It also expressed concern over frivolous complaints being filed against members of judiciary. Probes based on motivated complaints will hit functioning of trial judiciary, SC said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126363834,imgsize-81092,width-400,resizemode-4/supreme-court.jpg"
Right to speedy trial irrespective of nature of offence: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/right-to-speedy-trial-irrespective-of-nature-of-offence-supreme-court-grants-bail-to-amtek-chairmanin-jail-for-16-months/articleshow/126384415.cms,"‘Really Happy For Others’: SC Rejects Umar Khalid’S Bail; Partner Shares His Reaction

If state can’t ensure speedy trial, don’t oppose bail plea: Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: A day after Supreme Court rejected the bail plea of activists Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam by holding that delay in trial and long incarceration cannot be the sole ground to grant relief, another bench of the court on Tuesday held that an accused has fundamental right to speedy trial and it is not eclipsed by the nature of the offence.It said delay in trial is a valid ground to grant bail and granted relief to former Amtek Group chairperson Arvind Dham who has been in jail for the last 16 months in a money laundering case.“The right to speedy trial, enshrined under Article 21 of Constitution, is not eclipsed by the nature of the offence,” said a bench of Justices Sanjay Kumar and Alok Aradhe. It said SC had in multiple cases invoked long incarceration to grant bail when the jail period ranged from 3-17 months.Prolonged incarceration of an undertrial, without commencement or reasonable progress of trial, cannot be countenanced, as it has the effect of converting pretrial detention into form of punishment,” said the SC bench.Though Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam, who have spent almost six years in jail, are being prosecuted for terror acts under UAPA, the bail provisions — under Section 43D(5) of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and Section 45 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act — are similar.Both say an accused cannot be released on bail if there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accusation against such person is prima facie true and condition is imposed under the accused to demonstrate prima facie innocence.The court’s order granting bail to former Amtek Group chairperson Arvind Dham is in contradiction to the order passed while rejecting the bail plea of the student activists but it is in conformity with orders passed by SC earlier, including in cases of former Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and TN minister Senthil Balaji. It shows inconsistency in the approach of the apex court.Allowing the plea of Dham, the bench said gravity of offence is one of the factors which is to be considered while deciding bail but said that statutory restrictions (as provided under PMLA, UAPA) cannot be permitted to result in indefinite pretrial detention in violation of Article 21.“It is well settled that if the State or any prosecuting agency including, the court, concerned has no wherewithal to provide or protect the fundamental right of an accused, to have a speedy trial as enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution, then the State or any other prosecuting agency should not oppose the plea for bail on the ground that the crime committed is serious. Article 21 of the Constitution applies irrespective of the nature of the crime,” it said.“The aforesaid proposition was quoted with approval by another two-judge bench of this court and it was held that long period of incarceration for around 17 months and the trial not even having commenced, the appellant in that case has been deprived of his right to speedy trial,” the court added.The bench noted that there was no likelihood of trial being concluded in near future as there are 210 witnesses to be examined in the proceeding. “There is no likelihood of trial commencing in the near future. The continued incarceration in such circumstances, particularly where the evidence which is primarily documentary in nature, is already in custody of the prosecution, violates the right of the appellant to speedy trial under Article 21 of the Constitution of India,” it said.While allowing bail plea of UAPA accused K A Najeeb, alleged to be a member of banned PFI, Chief Justice Surya Kant, who was part of a three-judge bench and penned the judgment, had said Section 43D(5) of UAPA per se did not oust the ability of constitutional courts to grant bail on grounds of violation of fundamental rights of accused.","A day after Supreme Court rejected the bail plea of activists Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam, another bench of the court on Tuesday held that an accused has fundamental right to speedy trial.

KOLKATA: A primary school on the outskirts of Kolkata, which received Rs 12 lakh from Venezuela when Hugo Chavez was president, held a special prayer Tuesday for peace and stability in the country that was plunged into uncertainty following US’ capture and detention of Chavez’s successor, Nicolás Maduro, along with his wife Cilia Flores.Led by headmaster Sandip Baidya, around 30 students of Bagu Junior Basic School in Rajarhat joined the morning prayer and gathered around a portrait of Chavez.“Our students know his (Chavez’s) name and have heard the name of his country but they are not very well informed about what is happening there. We held a prayer for the people of Venezuela, from whom we once received generous funds for the school’s development,” Baidya said. The headmaster gave a short speech before the assembly observed a minute’s silence.On March 6, 2005, the-then Left Front govt arranged the visit of Chavez — a socialist leader — to the school to showcase successful implementation of midday meal scheme in rural Bengal. Impressed by what he saw, Chavez approved a grant of Rs 12 lakh for Bagu Junior Basic School on his return to Venezuela, a country he governed from 1999 till 2013.The cheque arrived in 2007.The school spent a part of the money to add two rooms — one on the ground floor and the other on the first — and the rest to fill a small pond in front of the building for the children’s safety. Baidya said a Venezuelan govt representative visited the school in 2020 to review the work undertaken with the money they sent.All the teachers and other employees who were at the school during Chavez’s visit have since retired, except Kalyani Mandal, who cooks midday meal. Now in her late 60s, Mandal remembers what she, her mother-in-law and two sisters-in-law had prepared that day: “We had cooked rice, dal and sabji, and boiled eggs. The guest (Chavez) served the meal to the children. There was a huge crowd. People from other villages had come to see him. ”","Bagu Junior Basic School in Rajarhat, West Bengal, received Rs 12 lakh from Venezuela when Hugo Chavez was president.

THANE: A rare alliance between BJP and Congress has emerged in the township of Ambernath after recent local body elections, surprising political observers and party cadres. BJP has joined hands with councillors from Congress and the Ajit Pawar-headed Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) to form the Ambernath Vikas Aghadi and take control of a municipal council in the Mumbai region, keeping Shiv Sena out of office.The polls were held last month, during which Shiv Sena and BJP, despite being allies at the state and national levels, contested separately. In the 60-member council, Sena emerged the single-largest party, winning 27 seats. BJP secured 14 seats, while Congress won 12. Ajit Pawar-headed NCP managed to win four seats, and two independents were also elected. Shiv Sena, however, suffered a setback in election to the municipal president's post, where its candidate Manisha Walekar lost to BJP nominee Tejashree Karanjule Patil.BJP captured the president's position, but lacked the numerical strength among councillors to run the civic body independently. In a municipal council, which functions in a manner largely similar to a municipal corporation, the president has the authority to decide which issues are taken up for discussion in General Body meetings. However, when it comes to passing a proposal or resolution by consensus, the matter must be approved by a majority vote.To overcome the lack of a majority, BJP initiated talks with opposition parties at the local level. The negotiations culminated on Tuesday with the formation of the Ambernath Vikas Aghadi.The Congress state brass said ""no formal proposal"" for a tie-up has been received yet, but the alliance announced in Ambernath includes 14 BJP corporators, a BJP-backed municipal president, 12 Congress corporators, four NCP (Ajit Pawar faction) corporators, and one independent, giving the coalition a combined strength of 32 - crossing the majority mark in the 60-member council. BJP corporator Abhijit Karanjule Patil has been appointed group leader of the alliance.Speaking to TOI, Abhijit said BJP had contested the elections against corruption and a culture of intimidation under the Shiv Sena's long rule in the civic body. ""Our objective was to free the municipal administration from fear and corruption and to ensure development in Ambernath. Keeping that goal in mind, we formed this alliance.""The move has drawn sharp criticism from Sena. Party netas have termed the Aghadi as an ""unethical and opportunistic arrangement."" Shiv Sena MLA from Ambernath, Balaji Kinikar, said that while the BJP campaigns nationally for a ""Congress-free India,"" it has strengthened Congress at the municipal level for the sake of power. A Congress neta said the options are either aligning with BJP or the Shinde faction or remaining absent. However, no formal proposal for an alliance has been received by the Congress, he said, and no decision has been taken so far.",A rare alliance between BJP and Congress has emerged in the township of Ambernath.

PALGHAR: An alleged ragging incident at a private medical college hostel in Maharashtra’s Palghar district has led to police action and the suspension of a hostel warden and a teacher, after a female student was reportedly forced to perform namaz, according to news agency PTI.The incident occurred on Sunday night at the institute located in Posheri village of Wada taluka.

Donald Trump Says PM Modi 'Not Happy With Me' Over Higher Russian Oil Tariffs

The US Supreme Court is likely to announce its final ruling on President Donald Trump's global tariffs on Friday, with regards to its legality that has put global economies on edge.According to Reuters, the court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, will also address cases involving voting rights, conversion therapy bans, and future matters concerning transgender athletes and Federal Reserve leadership.The last hearing on tariffs was in November, when, both conservative and liberal justices questioned the legality of using a 1977 emergency powers law to impose trade restrictions. Trump has defended his actions strongly on social media, stating ""Because of Tariffs, our Country is financially, AND FROM A NATIONAL SECURITY STANDPOINT, FAR STRONGER AND MORE RESPECTED THAN EVER BEFORE.""The US president used the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to tackle what he called trade deficit emergencies. He also applied it to pressure China, Canada, and Mexico to help fight fentanyl trafficking.Trump recently expressed worry about possibly losing the case, calling such an outcome a ""terrible blow"" to the United States.The court is also weighing other significant matters. In October, they heard arguments about the Voting Rights Act's Section 2, which protects minority voting power. The conservative majority seemed likely to limit this protection. They also considered a challenge to Colorado's ban on conversion therapy for LGBT minors, with justices appearing to favor a Christian counselor's free speech argument.Looking ahead, the court will hear cases about transgender athletes in school sports on January 13. Later this month, they'll also consider Trump's unprecedented attempt to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, a case that could affect the central bank's independence.","The US Supreme Court is likely to announce its final ruling on President Donald Trump's global tariffs on Friday.

Trump wants to buy, not seize Greenland: US secretary of state Marco Rubio

What is Greenland's stand?





The White House on Tuesday (local time) said that President Donald Trump is actively discussing options to acquire Greenland, including the potential use of the US military, reviving an ambition first floated during his initial term despite firm opposition from Europe and Greenland itself.In a statement, the White House said Trump views control of the Arctic island as a national security priority, aimed at deterring US adversaries in the region.“The president and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the US military is always an option at the commander-in-chief’s disposal,” the statement said.A senior US official toldd said the administration is considering multiple pathways, including an outright purchase of Greenland or a Compact of Free Association. Such an agreement would stop short of incorporating the territory as part of the United States. No potential purchase price has been discussed.“Diplomacy is always the president’s first option. He loves deals,” the official said.Secretary of state Marco Rubio told lawmakers in a classified briefing on Monday that the administration’s goal is to buy Greenland from Denmark and that recent rhetoric does not signal an imminent invasion, according to New York Times.Some Republicans and Democrats pushed back, warning that the United States must respect Danish sovereignty and Nato commitments. Administration officials argue Greenland is strategically vital due to its untapped mineral resources critical for advanced technology and defense.Trump’s push to acquire the island, the official said, “is not going away.”Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, has repeatedly said it does not want to become part of the United States.Denmark, Canada and several major European powers reiterated on Tuesday that the island belongs to its people. According to Reuters, US military seizure of Greenland from Denmark, a Nato ally, would send shockwaves through the alliance and further strain US-European relations.Despite the pushback, Trump has continued to explore ways to expand US influence over the island, which sits at the center of intensifying Arctic competition involving Russia and China.His renewed interest comes after the recent US arrest of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, an event that Trump allies say has emboldened his broader foreign policy posture.","The White House said that President Donald Trump is actively discussing options to acquire Greenland, including the potential use of the US military.

Post-Maduro Venezuela: Foreign Reporters TARGETED, Gunfire & Armed Patrols Under Delcy Rodriguez





Venezuela’s interim leader Delcy Rodriguez on Tuesday firmly rejected claims by the United States that it is now in control of the country, and also announced a week of national mourning for those killed during the US military operation that led to the capture of President Nicolas Maduro.Speaking on state television, Rodriguez said Venezuela remained sovereign and was being governed by its own people. She pushed back against statements by US President Donald Trump, who has said Washington is now “in charge” and that Venezuela will hand over millions of barrels of oil to the United States.""The government of Venezuela is in charge in our country, and no-one else,"" Rodriguez said, three days after US special forces carried out a raid in the Venezuelan capital and detained Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, who have since been taken to the United States to face trial.At the same time, Rodriguez struck a sombre tone at home. She announced seven days of mourning for those killed in the US assault, describing them as people who lost their lives defending the country.""We are a people that does not surrender, we are a people that does not give up,"" she declared, paying tribute to the ""martyrs"" of the US attacks.Venezuelan authorities confirmed that at least 23 members of the armed forces, including five generals, were killed.Cuba, a close ally, said 32 Cuban military personnel also died. Venezuela has not released an official civilian death toll, though the attorney general said there were “dozens” of civilian and military casualties.In Caracas, thousands of Maduro supporters marched through the streets, demanding his release. While some Venezuelans oppose Maduro, fear of state repression has limited public celebrations over his downfall.The constitution says that once Maduro is formally declared absent, elections must be held within 30 days, setting the stage for a deeply uncertain period ahead for the country.",Venezuela's interim leader Delcy Rodriguez firmly rejects claims by the United States that it is now in control of the country.

Sergio Jimenez found dead as family describes final moments during livestream





A 37-year-old streamer died while live on camera in Spain, and police are now checking if viewers who paid to watch him could face legal trouble. The man, Sergio Jimenez, was found dead at his family home in Vilanova i la Geltrú, near Barcelona, during the early hours of December 31.Police confirmed the death is being treated as a serious case linked to an extreme online challenge. Investigators have not ruled out expanding the probe to see if anyone may be criminally responsible for encouraging risky behavior.According to Spanish authorities, Sergio Jimenez had agreed to take part in a private, pay-per-view livestream where viewers donated money and pushed him to carry out dangerous acts over several hours. While the broadcast was still running, his younger brother discovered him unresponsive in his bedroom.A spokesperson for the Mossos d’Esquadra said:“We can confirm we are investigating the death of a 37-year-old man found lifeless at a property in Vilanova i la Geltrú in the province of Barcelona in the early hours of December 31. We are awaiting the full autopsy results and are looking into the context of this man’s death to determine whether a crime has occurred.”Sergio Jimenez lived in the home with his mother, Teresa. She told Catalan newspaper El Periodico that the family had been worried about his online activity for months.She said:“Jordi, my eldest son, who lives in the Pyrenees, warned us a couple of months ago Sergio was making these kinds of videos.”Teresa described the moment she realized something was wrong.“I got up to go to the bathroom just before 2am and saw the door to his room was ajar. I asked him what he was doing but he didn’t answer.”She added:“I tried to go in, but there were clothes or something on the bedroom floor and I couldn’t. I kept asking him from outside but he didn’t answer. I could see him kneeling on the bed, as if he were praying.”Her other son, Daniel, rushed in and called emergency services after confirming Sergio had already died.Daniel said:“There was an almost empty bottle of whisky, a couple of cans of energy drinks and a pile of cocaine on a red plate. My brother was kneeling on the floor, his head resting on the mattress. The computer was on and I could hear voices asking him if he was sleeping off his hangover.”Spanish media reported the livestream was limited to a private group, where viewers paid money and demanded more extreme actions. Police are now checking whether those payments and messages could count as encouragement of dangerous behavior under Spanish law.Also Read: Did Twitch Get Hacked?

Twitch streamer Krimoe detained near the Houses of Parliament during live broadcast







A Twitch streamer has been arrested in London after a livestream showed a toy gun being waved near the Houses of Parliament. The incident happened in a busy public place, with famous landmarks clearly visible in the background. Police acted fast after the video appeared online and raised safety concerns.The streamer, known online as Krimoe, was broadcasting live on Twitch when officers arrived at the scene. He was later arrested on suspicion of having an imitation firearm in a public place. The arrest happened while the group was still live, making the moment spread quickly on social media.The Metropolitan Police confirmed that 11 men were arrested in total. All were later released on bail as officers continue their investigation. No one was hurt, but the case has sparked serious questions about public safety, livestream behavior, and responsibility online. The incident happened close to some of the most guarded locations in the UK, which is why police took it very seriously from the start.Krimoe, who has more than 48,000 followers, was part of a group livestreaming near the Houses of Parliament.The video showed the Big Ben and the Palace of Westminster clearly behind them.During the stream, a toy gun appeared on camera. It was pointed toward the lens and then passed around between people in the group. Moments later, police officers arrived and stopped the broadcast.The Metropolitan Police said in a statement that officers arrested 11 men “on suspicion of possession of an imitation firearm in a public place.” Police added that all suspects have been bailed while further checks are carried out.UK law treats imitation firearms seriously, especially in public places. Although it was a prop - it could still cause fear and panic especially when used in an environment such as Parliament that is very sensitive to the public. There were many comments made during the live-streamed incident stating how reckless the actions were. Others pointed out how livestreams can turn risky when creators try to shock viewers for attention.Twitch, which launched in 2011, allows users to broadcast live for long hours. While it started mainly for gaming, many streamers now use it for outdoor and lifestyle content. This case has again raised concerns about safety rules and how far creators should go during live broadcasts. Police have not confirmed when charging decisions will be made. For now, the investigation remains open.Also Read: Did Twitch Get Hacked?

Delcy Rodriguez was sworn in as Venezuela’s interim president on Monday, two days after US forces captured her predecessor, Nicolas Maduro, and his wife, Cilia Flores, to face trial in New York.Rodriguez took the oath in the National Assembly, telling lawmakers she did so ""in the name of all Venezuelans."" She has hinted she will cooperate with Washington. She had been serving as the vice president of the nation since 2018.Rodriguez was already effectively running the country since Maduro’s capture on Saturday. She initially said that Venezuela would “never again be anyone’s colony.”By Sunday evening, she dialled down her tone and issued a statement inviting the US government “to work jointly on an agenda of cooperation, aimed at shared development, within the framework of international law, and that strengthens lasting peaceful coexistence.”Addressing President Donald Trump directly, Rodriguez said: “President Donald Trump: our peoples and our region deserve peace and dialogue, not war. That has always been President Nicolás Maduro’s conviction and it is that of all Venezuela at this moment. This is the Venezuela I believe in and to which I have dedicated my life. My dream is for Venezuela to become a great power where all decent Venezuelans can come together.Venezuela has the right to peace, development, sovereignty and a future.”Rodriguez’s rise followed a series of extraordinary events. Maduro and Flores were captured by US forces and taken to New York, where they pleaded not guilty on drug and weapons charges in a federal court on Monday. The Supreme Court of Venezuela had sworn Rodriguez in as president on Saturday, and the country’s armed forces formally recognised her authority the next day, while still demanding the immediate release of Maduro and his wife at the same time.US President Donald Trump warned that Rodriguez could “pay a very big price” if she did not comply with his orders. He added that the US would now “run” Venezuela and hinted at a possible second strike if remaining members of Maduro’s administration refuse to cooperate with Washington. US secretary of state later clarified Trump's position that US will only create an oil blockade in Venezuela and does not want total hold and governance of the Latin American country.Furthermore, the situation sidelined Venezuela’s democratic opposition, which is led by Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado. Machado had dedicated her Peace Prize to Trump after winning it last year.A lot of Venezuelans have been celebrating Maduro’s downfall, but many remain cautious due to the alarming number of arrests of people who opposed the ousted leader.The American forces last week carried out Operation Absolute Resolve, in which they conducted coordinated strikes across key locations in Caracas, killing dozens.","Delcy Rodriguez was sworn in as Venezuela’s interim president on Monday.

US Shooting Probe | ‘He Killed Himself By...': BIG Reveal After Brown University Shooter Found Dead

Planning, intent, and lack of remorse

“I don’t give a damn about how you judge me or what you think of me,” he said in one recording.

“I’m not going to apologize because during my lifetime no one sincerely apologized to me.”

“To say that I was extraordinarily satisfied, no, but also I don’t regret what I did,”

Views on responsibility, injury, and mental state

“Actually, I think that coming here, both times I did, was a f****g mistake. But to say that you all are extraordinarily bad, that would be neither bad nor good.”

“Honestly, my only regret is this thing in the eye,” he said, laughing. “But it was really hard, man.”

“I already know that you are going to say that I am mentally ill, or some shit like that,” he said. “That is all nonsense.”

“I am sane… I am sane, and… I’ve always been, more or less.”

“In my take on all of this,” he said, pausing repeatedly, “I think the world cannot be redeemed. To sum it all up, that is it.”





Federal assessment





Federal authorities say the man who killed two Brown University students and an MIT professor planned the attacks for at least six semesters and later recorded a series of videos in which he expressed no remorse, rejected apologies, and described the shootings as deliberate. The US Department of Justice released transcripts of the recordings on Tuesday, days after formally confirming the shooter’s death.The shooter, identified by law enforcement as Claudio Neves Valente, was a 48-year-old Portuguese national and former Brown University student. On 13 December, he opened fire inside an engineering building at Brown University, killing two students, Ella Cook and MukhammadAziz Umurzokov, and wounding nine others.Two days later, on 15 December, Valente fatally shot Nuno F.G. Loureiro at his home in Brookline, Massachusetts. Loureiro was an MIT professor and had attended school in Portugal decades earlier with Valente.On Thursday, 18 December 2025, the US Attorneys’ Offices, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives jointly announced Valente’s death. He was found dead inside a storage facility in Salem, New Hampshire.During a federal search of the storage unit, investigators recovered an electronic device containing several short videos Valente recorded after the shootings.In a statement released by the US Department of Justice, officials said the FBI recovered the device while executing a federal search warrant on 18 December. The videos were recorded in Portuguese and later translated into English.“In these videos, Neves Valente admitted that he had been planning the Brown University shooting for a long time,” the department said, adding that he did not provide a motive for targeting either the Brown students or the MIT professor.In the recordings, Valente said he had been planning the attack for more than six semesters and claimed he had numerous chances to carry it out earlier, but did not. In one video, he said he had “plenty of opportunities” but “always chickened out”.Across more than 11 minutes of footage, Valente spoke about the shootings, addressed how he was portrayed in the media, complained about a self-inflicted eye injury, and repeatedly rejected the idea that he owed anyone an apology.In another, he said:He framed his actions as intentional and final. He said his goal was to “leave on his own terms” and made clear he felt no regret for the killings themselves. In a DOJ statement, Valente was described as having “showed no remorse during the recordings”.the transcript reads.Valente also spoke at length about how he expected his actions to be interpreted. He dismissed claims that he was motivated by hatred of the United States, saying instead that the shootings were about opportunity rather than ideology.“When I say that I have no hatred toward America, I also have no love for it,” he said, before adding:He complained repeatedly about a serious eye injury he said he sustained during the attack on the MIT professor, describing it as the only thing he regretted.Valente rejected the suggestion that mental illness explained his actions.He insisted:Near the end of one recording, as the lights in the storage facility began to dim, Valente reflected on his worldview.The DOJ said Valente showed no remorse in the recordings and instead blamed others while complaining about his injuries.“He exposed his true nature when he blamed innocent, unarmed children for their deaths at his hand and grumbled about a self-inflicted injury,” the department said.Officials said the investigation into motive remains ongoing, but added that based on the evidence reviewed so far, authorities do not believe there is any continuing public safety threat linked to the shootings. Additional updates will be provided as more information is developed and after appropriate victim notifications.","US Department of Justice released transcripts of the recordings on Tuesday.

Trump mocks French President Emmanuel Macron





On Tuesday, December 6, 2026, US President Donald Trump gave a speech to the House GOP members at the Trump Kennedy Center in Washington, DC. From the impact of the Trump administration to the US's domination over the world and even his dancing skills, the 79-year-old leader of the nation addressed numerous topics and people in his 1-hour 25-minute speech.What should have been an address prepping the Republican leaders for the upcoming midterm elections, became a wide-ranging speech on everything he and his administration were able to achieve after the 'mess' they were handed post former President Joe Biden's term.Interestingly, Trump referenced three world leaders in his speech-Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi , former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and French President Emmanuel Macron . He made some surprising and eye-raising comments about the world leaders that have left many shocked.While praising the 'brilliant' operation that the US military carried out during the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, he said that his decision should have been appreciated. ""They'd been after this guy for years and years and years. And you know he is a violent guy, he gets up there and he tries to imitate my dance a little bit. But he's killed millions of people,"" he said, justifying the attack and capture of the president and his wife on January 3, 2026.Next, he went on to praise the US military and its weapons. ""Nobody has our weapons, nobody has our quality of weapons. The problem is we don't produce them fast enough,"" he said.""We have the best weapons in the world, but it takes too long to get them. Including allies, when allies want to buy they have to wait four years for a plane, five years for a helicopter, we are not doing that anymore"" added Trump.He referenced how India had ordered 68 Apaches but had to wait for five years to receive them, which led to the country's prime minister, Narendra Modi reaching out to Trump. ""Prime Minister Modi came to see me, 'Sir, may I see you please? Yes!' I have a very good relationship with him. He's not that happy with me, cuz they are paying a lot of tariffs now, but they have now reduced it substantially, because of Russia,"" he explained. ""We’re getting rich from tariffs. Over $650 billion is set to flow into our country shortly"" he added.One of the most controversial segments of Trump's address was his mocking of French President Emmanuel Macron. While talking about the price of prescription drugs in America and comparing how the country paid more than any other country in the world, he referenced a conversation with Macron.Trump claimed he confronted Macron about the cost of prescription drugs, alleging that the US was paying '14 times more' than other countries for the same 'fat drug' Ozempic. He argued that America was subsidising lower prices across Europe and beyond. Thus, he contacted France and several other nations to increase their drug prices, a demand that initially faced pushback. ""Every country said the same thing,"" said the president.""No, no, no, we will not do this. Some were strong. Some were very nice, some were rude. But they all said one thing - no, we won't. And within, I'd say on average, 3.2 minutes, they were all saying, 'we would be honoured to quadruple our drug prices'.""He singled out Macron ""just as an example"" and shared how the threat of an increased tariff had the French president agreeing to the demand. ""Emmanuel, if on Monday, you haven't agreed to every single thing that we want, I'm putting a 25% tariff on everything coming out of France, including your wines, your champagnes and everything else,"" warned Trump.""Emmanuel said to me, 'Donald, uh, you have a deal, I would increase my prescription drug prices by 200% or whatever. I would love to do it would be such an honour,"" he claimed, Macron replied to him .While Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores face trial in New York, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and French President Emmanuel Macron are yet to respond to the shocking claims and comments which have made quite a buzz globally.","US President Donald Trump gave a speech to the House GOP members at the Trump Kennedy Center in Washington, DC.

"‘If we don’t win 2026 midterms, they’ll impeach me’: Trump rallies Republicans ahead of November polls",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/if-we-dont-win-2026-midterms-theyll-impeach-me-trump-rallies-republicans-ahead-of-november-polls/articleshow/126379702.cms,"Trump's Venezuela Invasion Sparks Rare MAGA Rebellion; MTG, Masssie Erupt | 'Russia, China Will...'





US President Donald Trump on Tuesday warned Republicans that failing to win the 2026 midterm elections would leave him vulnerable to impeachment by Democrats, as he sought to rally party lawmakers ahead of a high-stakes electoral cycle.“You gotta win the midterms ’cause, if we don’t win the midterms, it’s just gonna be – I mean, they’ll find a reason to impeach me,” Trump told House Republican lawmakers at a closed-door retreat in Washington. “I’ll get impeached.”Trump’s remarks came as Republicans prepare for November’s midterm elections, when all seats in the House of Representatives and a third of the Senate will be contested. With the GOP holding a razor-thin majority in the House, the outcome could determine the fate of Trump’s legislative agenda and his political standing in Washington.In a wide-ranging and often meandering speech that stretched close to 90 minutes, the president defended his actions during the Capitol riot five years ago, joked about courting transgender voters, and mocked a predecessor’s use of a wheelchair. While the event was intended to align the party’s executive and legislative wings, Trump devoted more time to airing grievances than outlining new policy initiatives.“We won every swing state. We won the popular vote by millions. We won everything,” Trump said, revisiting his 2024 election victory. “But they say that when you win the presidency, you lose the midterm.”Historical trends suggest the party in power often loses congressional seats during midterms, leaving Republicans with little margin for error. Trump acknowledged those risks but argued that his record should be enough to deliver victories in November.“You have so many good nuggets. You have to use them. If you can sell them we’re going to win,” he told lawmakers. “We’ve had the most successful first year of any president in history and it should be a positive.”The House GOP’s fragile majority has narrowed further following the death of California Rep. Doug LaMalfa and the resignation of former Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. Trump noted the challenge facing Speaker Mike Johnson, saying, “You can’t be tough when you have a majority of three, and now, sadly, a little bit less than that.”Trump also referenced health care talks with insurers and briefly touched on Venezuela, tariffs and drug pricing, though he did not announce new legislative proposals. The meeting came amid renewed debate over Trump’s powers following the administration’s capture of Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro, an operation largely backed by House Republicans.As the midterms loom, Trump made clear the stakes for his presidency, framing the election as a firewall against Democratic efforts to remove him from office.","President Donald Trump warned Republicans that failing to win the 2026 midterm elections would leave him vulnerable to impeachment by Democrats.

Europe sees red over Greenland as Trump aide asserts it belongs to US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/europe-sees-red-over-greenland-as-trump-aide-asserts-it-belongs-to-us/articleshow/126378478.cms,"TOI correspondent from Washington:

'End Of NATO': Denmark 'SURRENDERS' Greenland To U.S. As PM Admits Trump Serious About Takeover?





Hours after top Trump aide Stephen Miller audaciously asserted US “right” over Greenland, leaders of eight European nations on Tuesday stood up for Denmark and its self-governing constituent, bringing the 75-year old transatlantic alliance to a crossroad.""Greenland belongs to its people. It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland,” leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Denmark and the U.K said in a rare joint statement, pushing back at the US position.In stunning remarks on CNN on Tuesday, White House Deputy Chief of Staff and Trump immigration czar Stephen Miller questioned Denmark’s right to Greenland, while asserting that it is the formal position of the Trump administration that the long-recognized Danish realm should be part of the United States.“By what right does Denmark assert control over Greenland? What is the basis of their territorial claim? The United States is the power of Nato . For the US to secure the Arctic region, to protect and defend Nato and Nato interests, obviously Greenland should be part of the United States,” Miller said.The Trump aide repeatedly rebuffed the host’s question if he could take the military option off the table, scoffing at Greenland’s 30,000 population and asserting “We wouldn’t need military action…nobody is gonna fight the US militarily over the future of Greenland.”Indeed, the European statement, while pushing back at US claims, was not exactly muscular, preferring to remind Washington of mutual Nato obligations to defend the Arctic. It said that security in the Arctic must be achieved collectively with Nato allies, including the United States, by upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of border, adding ""These are universal principles, and we will not stop defending them. """"Nato has made clear that the Arctic region is a priority and European allies are stepping up. We and many other allies have increased our presence, activities and investments, to keep the Arctic safe and to deter adversaries. The Kingdom of Denmark—including Greenland—is part of Nato ,"" the statement said.Individually, European leaders have made stronger statements. Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has said any US invasion of Greenland would spell an end to Nato , and Germany’s foreign minister Johann Wadephul has warned that the United States will be at war with Europe if it grabs Greenland, asserting Nato members will have an obligation to defend Denmark if it was attacked by the US.“Greenland is part of the Kingdom of Denmark. And since Denmark is a member of Nato , Greenland will, in principle, also be subject to Nato defence,” he said.Greenland, a Danish colony from 1721 until 1953, is now an autonomous constituent country within the Kingdom of Denmark, locked in a relationship known as the Rigsfællesskab or ""Unity of the Realm.""While it is largely self-governing, Denmark controls Foreign Affair, Defense & National Security, and Monetary Policy. No administration before Trump’s had challenged this arrangement.Miller faced questions on the Trump White House position on Greenland after his wife, also a former White House staffer, posted on social media map of Greenland draped in US colors with the word “Soon” – soon after the US infiltration into Venezuela and its abduction of President Nicolas Maduro. The answers were a cold, chilling assertion of US “right” over Greenland that seemed to answer the question now raging across global capitals: Who’s next?","Leaders of eight European nations on Tuesday stood up for Denmark and its self- governing constituent, bringing the 75-year old transatlantic alliance to a crossroad.

Vivek Ramaswamy faces racist jab as Florida governor candidate James Fischer says ‘we wear shoes’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/vivek-ramaswamy-faces-racist-jab-as-florida-governor-candidate-james-fischer-says-we-wear-shoes/articleshow/126378334.cms,"Usha Vance J**t Slur Sparks Firestorm: Vivek Ramaswamy’s Outburst Splits MAGA | ‘You Have No Place…’





A Florida Republican gubernatorial candidate is facing backlash after a video surfaced appearing to mock Vivek Ramaswamy ’s Indian origin, drawing cheers from a crowd as he delivered what critics are calling a racially coded attack.The remarks were made by James Fishback, a 30-year-old hedge fund CEO and first-time Republican candidate for Florida governor, during a recent public event. In the clip circulating online, Fishback appears to ridicule Ramaswamy through a series of remarks that many have described as openly racist.The video begins with Fishback saying: “there is a fork in the road...I told that to Vivek and he said, ‘what’s a fork?’”The crowd immediately reacted with laughter and cheers, with Fishback visibly pleased as the joke landed.He then continued: “It’s weird we are all wearing shoes, it’s weird. We do that in oir country. We wear shoes. It would be weird if I showed uo not wearing shoes, right?”The clip ends shortly after, with applause from those in attendance.The exchange has fueled criticism online, with many pointing out that Ramaswamy’s Indian heritage appears to be the clear target of the remarks. One user pointed out, ""This guy is so fake.He used to support Vivek when he was trying to make a name for himself.""Another said, ""He’s running for mayor or standup comedian?""The rivalry between Fishback and Ramaswamy is not new, nor is Fishback’s hostility toward immigrants.Fishback has repeatedly positioned himself against immigration programs, particularly the H-1B visa system. He has previously stated that “there is no American Dream when H-1B visa holders are stealing jobs from Americans,” a comment he made after Ramaswamy posted about American exceptionalism, writing: “There’s no ‘Canadian Dream.’ There’s no ‘British Dream.’ There’s no ‘Chinese Dream.’ It’s called the American Dream for a reason. It’s what makes American exceptionalism possible.”Fishback has made opposition to the H-1B visa program a centerpiece of his campaign, declaring: “I’m running for Florida governor to end the H-1B scam so our workers can get great-paying jobs again.”Fishback, who is campaigning on a platform of “aggressive affordability” and “anti-H-1B” policies, reportedly drew more than 150 supporters to the event where the remarks were made.The situation is made more complex by Fishback’s past political ties. He previously served as an adviser to President Donald Trump’s government efficiency advisory commission, which Ramaswamy was co-chairing with Elon Musk. Fishback was also once described as a confidant of Ramaswamy.More recently, Fishback has found himself at the center of another major controversy, this time involving Walt Disney World.In late December 2025, Fishback attempted to host an unsanctioned political “meet-and-greet” at a Walt Disney World Resort. According to reports, more than 150 supporters gathered for the event. Disney security intervened, citing the company’s strict ban on unauthorized political activity on its private property.Fishback was escorted off the premises and later issued a formal lifetime trespass warning, barring him from all Disney-owned properties.The fallout escalated in early January 2026, when Fishback took to X (formerly Twitter), accusing Disney of political censorship and ideological manipulation.“Disney is no longer just a theme park; it is a political machine,” Fishback wrote in a viral post. “By banning a candidate for Governor from speaking to citizens, they are showing their true colors. They are terrified of leaders who will stop them from manipulating the youth with their ‘woke’ social engineering.”","James Fishback, a hedge fund CEO and first-time Republican candidate for Florida governor, appeared to mock Vivek Ramaswamy's Indian heritage.

He's tortured.” He alleged the existence of a torture facility in Caracas and accused the “radical left” of backing protests in support of the Venezuelan leader.Trump further claimed that demonstrators calling for Maduro’s release were organised and paid, saying, “They're all paid people.

Conservative commentator and longtime Donald Trump supporter Megyn Kelly said she would “exercise caution” over the Trump administration’s military operation in Venezuela, sharply criticizing her former employer Fox News for what she described as uncritical coverage following the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.Speaking on The Megyn Kelly Show on Monday, Kelly made clear she remains pro-Trump and pro-military, but warned against what she said would have been the expected tone had she still been working at Fox.“I would have known that I was supposed to cheerlead it, and I turned on Fox News yesterday, and I’m sorry, but it was like watching Russian propaganda,” Kelly said. “There was nothing skeptical. It was all rah-rah cheerleading, yes, let’s go.”She added that there “are serious reasons to just exercise a note of caution before we just get on the rah-rah train.”Kelly pointed to recent US military interventions, including Iraq and Libya, which she said ended in a “quagmire” and have failed “nine times out of ten.”“I have seen what happens when you cheerlead unabashedly US intervention in foreign countries, thinking it’s for our good and for the international good,” she said.She went on to criticize Fox News more broadly, saying she has “been embarrassed” in the past by being part of what she described as “green light territory” when it came to approving US military involvement overseas.“We’re not great at going into these foreign countries, decapitating them at the leadership level, and then saying, either we’re going to steer the country to a better place, or it’s going to steer itself,” Kelly said.Kelly also expressed deep discomfort with Trump floating the idea of “boots on the ground” in Venezuela, framing her concerns as a parent.“I speak for a lot of moms and dads, for that matter, when I say I’m staying in yellow territory until we know more, and I will not be joining the Fox News cheerleading brigade this time. I’ve been burned too many times,” she said.She also took aim at Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who appeared alongside Trump on Air Force One on Sunday praising the operation.“The fact that Lindsey Graham is standing next to him is enough for me to know I don’t want it. I’m concerned,” Kelly said. “All of the neocons have been celebrating this whole thing like it’s, you know, Christmas in January, and that alone gives me pause. When Lindsey Graham is cheering, I’m not.”To underline her skepticism, Kelly invited Aaron Mate, an anti-war journalist, as her guest for the discussion.Later on Monday evening, Trump said the US would need to “nurse” Venezuela back to health, suggesting oil companies would play a central role and that taxpayers might ultimately help foot the bill.Trump said it would cost “a lot of money” to rebuild Venezuela’s energy infrastructure, but claimed the US could do it ahead of an 18-month timeline. He added, however, that American taxpayers could be on the hook, as oil companies may receive assistance to carry out the rebuilding.","Megyn Kelly said she would ‘exercise caution’ over the US military operation in Venezuela.

Craze, for love



A history of legal troubles







While the world might not be in love with FBI chief Kash Patel , he seems to have set an example for some young Republican members. A top aide to a Georgia Republican congressman is facing massive backlash after investigators alleged that he quietly handed out a fake internship to his girlfriend and got her on the federal payroll, despite her never having shown up for the job.Brandon Phillips, is a 39-year-old Chief of Staff to a Georgia representative. Mike Collins. Phillips has been accused of funding a paid congressional internship for a woman he was dating while she was simultaneously working elsewhere, as per a newly released report from the Office of Congressional Conduct (OCC).The findings, revealed in a 33-page referral were made public on Monday and have been forwarded to the House Ethics Committee for further review.As per the report, the OCC found ""substantial reason to believe"" that Phillips violated House rules by participating in the hiring and retention of Caroline Craze, 26, who was paid the dues of a district office intern despite never having worked at Collins' office.Craze received more than $10,000 in roughly four months for the alleged internship while she continued a full-time job elsewhere. As per the report, Craze's LinkedIn profile states her as working as an ""Internal Consultant"" at Cox Communications from January 2022 through January 2024.This overlaps with the period when the congressional office was paying her. Additionally, the OCC added that multiple witnesses had independently reported that Craze never worked in the office.“Ms. Craze never performed any duties in or for Rep. Collins’s District Office,” investigators wrote, despite being paid as an intern.Craze's Instagram profile obtained by the OCC includes pictures of her alongside not only Phillips but also Trump himself. Many on the internet have been questioning if the Phillips' decision was approved by Collins, too.Phillips on the contrary has been accused of failing to disclose the romantic relationship and improperly using his position to grant ""special favours or privileges"" to a person with whom he had a personal connection. House rules prohibit members and staff from engaging in biased employment decisions that benefit romantic partners.The report also mentioned Phillips' previous legal troubles. In 2022, he was arrested on a misdemeanour animal cruelty charge after he was accused of kicking a woman's dog. He was later released on a $1,200 bond.He also resigned as executive director of the Trump-Pence Georgia campaign in 2016 after reports of earlier criminal trespassing and battery charges resurfaced.As of now, Collin's office released a statement calling the complaint a politically motivated attack and describing it as “a sad attempt to derail one of Georgia’s most effective conservative legislators in Congress.”","Brandon Phillips, is a 39-year-old Chief of Staff to a Georgia representative.
