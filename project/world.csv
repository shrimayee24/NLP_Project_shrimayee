He was received at the airport by Russia's First Deputy Prime Minister Denis Manturov , who is senior to the Deputy Prime Minister that received Chinese President Xi Jinping during his recent visit to Russia.The protocol of having Manturov personally welcome PM Modi and accompany him to the hotel in the same car sends a strong signal about the importance Russia places on its relationship with India.This reception, with the highest-ranking Russian official below President Putin himself, contrasts with China's welcome, where the lower-ranking Deputy Prime Minister received President Xi.India has maintained a close relationship with Russia since the Cold War, and Russia was once India's largest arms supplier. However, the Ukraine conflict has strained Russia's military resources, leading to a decline in Russian arms exports to India in recent years.At the same time, India has emerged as a major buyer of discounted Russian oil, providing much-needed revenue for Moscow. This has reshaped the energy partnership, with India saving billions while bolstering Russia's war coffers.PM Modi's visit, his first to Russia since 2019, comes as India seeks to balance its longstanding ties with Moscow with growing security cooperation with Western powers.The high-level reception by Russia underscores India's continued significance as a partner, even as the global landscape shifts.","India has maintained a close relationship with Russia since the Cold War.

"Courts can't ask accused to share live location as bail condition, says Supreme Court",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/courts-cant-ask-accused-to-share-live-location-as-bail-condition-says-supreme-court/articleshow/111589569.cms,"SC: Riders can't be so severe as to frustrate bail order itself

NEW DELHI: Frowning upon courts, including itself, for directing accused to share their 'live location' with investigating agencies as a condition for being released on bail, Supreme Court Monday said that allowing a probe agency to continuously peep into the life of a person would constitute violation of the right to privacy.A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan reminded all courts to ensure that bail conditions should be such that constitutional rights of an accused were curtailed only to the ""minimum extent required"" and to maintain restraint and refrain from imposing ""fanciful, arbitrary or freakish"" conditions.Courts must show restraint while imposing bail conditions. Therefore, while granting bail, courts can curtail the freedom of the accused only to the extent required for imposing the bail conditions warranted by law. Bail conditions cannot be so onerous as to frustrate the order of bail itself. For example, the court may impose a condition of periodically reporting to the police station/court or not travelling abroad without prior permission, the SC bench said.Where circumstances require, the court may impose a condition restraining an accused from entering a particular area to protect the prosecution witnesses or the victims, the Supreme Court bench added.""But the court cannot impose a condition on the accused to keep the police constantly informed about his movement from one place to another. The object of the bail condition cannot be to keep a constant vigil on the movements of the accused enlarged on bail,"" it said.""The investigating agency cannot be permitted to continuously peep into the private life of the accused enlarged on bail, by imposing arbitrary conditions since that will violate the right of privacy of the accused, as guaranteed by Article 21,"" it added.The bench also held that a bail condition could not be imposed on a foreign national to get a certificate from the embassy that he shall not leave the country and shall appear before the special court as and when required.The bench noted that the object of imposing conditions of bail was to ensure that the accused did not interfere with or obstruct the investigation, remained available for the probe, did not tamper with or destroy evidence, remained regularly present for the trial and did not create obstacles in trial proceedings.""While imposing bail conditions, constitutional rights of an accused, who is ordered to be released on bail, can be curtailed only to the minimum extent required. Even an accused convicted by a competent court and undergoing a sentence in prison is not deprived of rights to life and privacy guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution,"" the bench said.It said presumption of innocence was applicable with the accused and he could not be deprived of all his rights guaranteed under the Constitution.Taking note of Google's reply in this case, the court said the PIN location did not enable real-time tracking of the user or the user's device. ""Therefore, the condition of the accused dropping a pin on Google Maps, as it stands, is completely redundant as the same does not help,"" it said.","Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan reminded all courts to ensure that bail conditions should be such that constitutional rights of an accused were curtailed only to the ""minimum extent required"" They said courts must show restraint and refrain from imposing ""fanciful, arbitrary or freakish"" conditions.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111589694,imgsize-422344,width-400,resizemode-4/111589694.jpg"

He gave up his life to save others,” said an inconsolable Smriti Singh, the widow of Captain Anshuman Singh, while she stood before President Droupadi Murmu with folded hands to accept the Kirti Chakra , India’s second-highest gallantry honour, awarded posthumously to her husband on Friday for saving his fellow men's lives and trying to protect critical medical equipment during a fire incident at an Army dump on the world’s highest battlefield, the Siachen Glacier.Captain Singh was posted with the 26th Battalion of the Punjab Regiment as a medical officer at Siachen. On July 19, 2023, an ammunition dump caught fire in the dead of night. The Captain saw a fibreglass hut engulfed in flames and quickly acted to save those trapped inside. He successfully rescued several individuals, but while trying to save critical medical equipment from a medical investigation centre that also caught fire, he laid down his life.The Rashtrapati Bhavan statement said: “Disregarding his own safety, Captain Anshuman Singh exhibited exceptional bravery and resolve to rescue many people during a major fire incident in Siachen. He was awarded the Kirti Chakra (posthumously) for his act of conspicuous gallantry and sacrifice.” Smriti Singh, along with the Captain’s mother Manju Singh, received the award from the President.After receiving the Kirti Chakra, Smriti Singh, in a video posted by a defense ministry spokesperson, recalled, “He once told me, ‘I would die with the brass on my chest. I would not die an ordinary death’.”Recalling her first meeting with Captain Singh, Smriti said, “We met on the first day of college. I don’t want to be dramatic, but it was love at first sight. After a month, he got selected into the Armed Forces Medical College (AFMC). We met at an engineering college, but then he got selected for medical college. Super intelligent guy. From then on, after just one month of meeting, it was a long-distance relationship for eight long years.”“Then we decided to get married. Unfortunately, within two months of our marriage, he got posted to Siachen,” she said.“On July 18, we had a long conversation about how our life was going to be in the next 50 years. We would build a house, have kids... On the morning of July 19, I got a call that he was no more. For the next 7-8 hours, we were not ready to accept that anything of this sort had happened. Now that I have the Kirti Chakra in my hand, maybe it is true. It’s okay; he’s a hero. We can manage our lives. But he gave his life to save the other three families, his army family,” Smriti said, trying to hold back her tears.After the incident last year, Captain Singh was cremated with full state honours in Bhagalpur in UP’s Deoria district, on July 22, 2023.President Murmu also presented 26 Shaurya Chakras, including seven posthumously, to personnel of the armed forces, Central Armed Police Forces, and state/UT police during a defence investiture ceremony.","Captain Anshuman Singh was posted with the 26th Battalion of the Punjab Regiment as a medical officer at Siachen.

'Israeli army used controversial Hannibal directive during October 7 Hamas attack',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israeli-army-used-controversial-hannibal-directive-during-october-7-hamas-attack/articleshow/111584527.cms,"Hannibal directive

The Israeli military reportedly employed the Hannibal Directive during the October 7 attack by Hamas , according to a recent report. This directive is a contentious policy within Israel's military framework, designed to prevent the capture of soldiers by enemy forces, even at the risk of endangering the soldiers' lives.During the attack, Hamas launched a significant assault on southern Israel, leading to intense clashes and a high number of casualties.The use of the Hannibal Directive during this incident has sparked considerable debate due to its controversial nature, a report in Aljazeera said.The Hannibal Directive, initially formulated in the 1980s, aims to thwart the capture of Israeli soldiers by any means necessary, including the use of overwhelming force. Critics argue that this policy places soldiers' lives in jeopardy and can lead to excessive and indiscriminate use of force, potentially violating international humanitarian laws.According to the report, the Israeli Defense Forces ( IDF ) invoked the directive in response to Hamas's aggressive actions, which involved taking hostages and infiltrating Israeli territory. The directive's implementation involved deploying significant military resources to prevent the capture of soldiers, even at great risk to those involved.The Hannibal directive is a controversial military protocol used by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) until 2016 to prevent the capture of Israeli soldiers by enemy forces. The key points about the Hannibal Directive are:It was introduced in 1986 after a number of abductions of IDF soldiers in Lebanon and subsequent prisoner exchanges.The directive authorized the use of maximum force, even at the risk of killing the captured soldier, to prevent the soldier from being taken prisoner.The exact wording of the directive was never made public, but reports indicate it allowed soldiers to fire at vehicles, roads, and abductors to stop a kidnapping, even if it meant harming the captive soldier.There were different versions of the directive that were interpreted differently by IDF commanders, leading to concerns about the value placed on a soldier's life.The directive was officially revoked in 2016, but reports suggest it may have been invoked again during the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, where the IDF was ordered to prevent ""at all costs"" the abduction of Israeli civilians or soldiers.The use of the Hannibal Directive is controversial under international law, as it risks violating a state's obligation to protect the right to life of its citizens, even if they are captured.","The Israeli military reportedly employed the Hannibal Directive during the October 7 attack by Hamas.

Amid reports that a Parkinson's disease expert visited the White House and met President Joe Biden's doctor in January, the White House Monday said the president is not being treated for Parkinson's disease. The press briefing turned chaotic as press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked to give clear answer on the visit of the Parkinson's specialist to which she strongly reacted and said she won't be able to divulge any name of experts for privacy and security reasons.She said Biden had seen a neurologist three times -- in three years -- connected to Biden's annual physical exams.Reports claimed not only in January, the neurologist visited the White House eight times, according to the visitors' log. The January meeting was with Biden's chief physician and a cardiologist.Dr Kevin Cannard , who works at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, has made early morning visits to the White House residence clinic seven times between July 2023 and March 2024 to meet with Megan Nasworthy, who coordinates primary care visits for the 81-year-old president and his family, New York Post reported.The eighth visit took place on January 17 where Dr Cannard met Biden's chief physician Dr Kevin O'Connor and cardiologist Dr John E Atwood. Cannard also met at the White House with Joshua Simmons, an emergency medical specialist at Walter Reed, in November 2022, the report said.The press secretary once again said that Biden did not have any medical examination after the debate.

They were accused of promoting terrorism through their adaptation of a classic fairy tale, which tells the stories of Russian women lured online to join the Islamic State group.Prosecutor Ekaterina Denisova claimed Petriychuk held ""extremely aggressive Islamic ideologies"" and that Berkovich justified and propagated terrorism. The court also banned both women from ""administering websites"" for three years after their release.""Finist the Brave Falcon"" premiered in 2020 and won two Golden Mask awards, the highest honor in Russian theater. The play's main character, feeling betrayed by her recruiter, returns to Russia only to be imprisoned as a terrorist. Both Petriychuk and Berkovich insisted the play had an anti-terror message.""I absolutely do not understand what this set of words has to do with me,"" said Berkovich, when she pleaded not guilty. ""I have never partaken in any forms of Islam: neither radical nor any other. I have respect for the religion of Islam, and I feel nothing but condemnation and disgust toward terrorists.""The trial, held partly behind closed doors, heightened concerns about freedom of expression in Russia. Defense lawyer Ksenia Karpinskaya described the hearing as ""absolutely illegal"" and ""unfair,"" pledging to appeal despite ""little hope.""The case has been condemned by prominent Russian intellectuals and performers, including Nobel Peace Prize laureate Dmitry A. Muratov and actress Yulia Peresild. Supporters suggest Berkovich'sprosecution may be linked to her critical poems about Russia's military offensive in Ukraine.Since the invasion of Ukraine, Russia's artistic community has faced increasing pressure from the Kremlin. The crackdown has effectively criminalized anti-war sentiment, and more than 99% of criminal trials in Russia result in convictions.The sentencing occurs amid recent deadly attacks by Islamist militants in Moscow and Dagestan, with the Kremlin suggesting unsubstantiated links to Ukraine.

Go ahead, announce for president.

Although only five lawmakers have publicly called for Biden to withdraw from the presidential race , those who are still backing him are said to be shrinking in numbers.Polls -- and public figures aligned with the Democratic Party -- are also suggesting that Biden should withdraw, and do it quickly, so that the party can nominate a new challenger to Trump before the party convention in Chicago on August 19.""Joe Biden has been a fine president, but it’s time for him—in the interests of the America he so clearly loves—to announce he will not run for re-election,"" the writer Stephen King, a fierce Trump critic, tweeted on Monday.Liberal media maven Michael Moore is among those pressing for Biden's withdrawal, saying putting him up to such scrutiny is the ""cruelest form of elder abuse.""""He was in epic distress that Thursday night (at the debate). Every cognitive default in his mind seemed to be shutting down. If this had been somebody that you truly cared about, loved, embraced, what would you have done?

The frontrunners on the former President's mind are either North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum or Senator JD Vance from Ohio, barring a last-minute surprise, New York Post reported quoting insiders.Trump 2024 senior adviser Jason Miller informed Fox News on Monday that the VP choice would be revealed by next Monday.The leading candidates for the GOP's VP slot are Doug Burgum, 67, and JD. Vance, 39, with Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) having a slim chance. Other potential candidates like Senator Tim Scott (R-SC) and former HUD Secretary Dr. Ben Carson are unlikely to be chosen, with one source stating there was ""no way"" Trump, 78, would pick Carson.While Burgum and Vance have been leading the list of potential running mates, Trump and his campaign have been cautious not to reveal too much. The report suggested Burgum has a 50-50 chance of being selected, Vance has a 30% chance, and Rubio and others have a 10% chance each.The report quoted another source as telling that it would likely be JD, Marco, or Burgum, believing that one of these three would ultimately be selected.“I would give Burgum and JD a little more of an edge than Marco,” the source was quoted as telling, handicapping that “Marco still has a shot” and that “Burgum and JD have an equal shot.”Trump is known for keeping the public and his aides in suspense about staffing decisions. This selection process is expected to include false leaks to generate speculation and intrigue, similar to the last-minute surprises during his 2016 selection of then-Indiana Gov. Mike Pence.There are indications that any of the top three candidates could be chosen next week. Rubio is reportedly set to attend Trump’s rally at Doral, Florida, on Tuesday night, having adjusted his schedule to be there. Another rally in western Pennsylvania on Saturday could be an opportune moment for Trump to announce Vance, who represents neighboring Ohio, as his choice.However, Trump may announce his decision at any time and in any manner, whether during a nighttime campaign event or a morning post on Truth Social.“Who, when, and where will be decided by President Trump,” campaign spokesperson was quoted as saying.All three main VP candidates have been strong supporters of Trump throughout his re-election campaign and participated in the post-debate spin room activities at the June 27 CNN showdown in Atlanta","Trump 2024 senior adviser Jason Miller informed Fox News on Monday that the VP choice would be revealed by next Monday.

Other potential candidates like Senator Tim Scott (R-SC) and former HUD Secretary Dr. Ben Carson are unlikely to be chosen, with one source stating there was 'no way' Trump would pick Carson.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111587323,imgsize-2090620,width-400,resizemode-4/111587323.jpg"
'Why UFOs target high-speed planes and nuclear warheads',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-ufos-target-high-speed-planes-and-nuclear-warheads/articleshow/111585689.cms,"A former senior intelligence official has come forward with startling claims regarding the recent surge in UFO sightings, attributing these mysterious objects' interest towards high-speed aircraft and nuclear weapons.As per a Daily Mail report, David Grusch , who previously worked with the US Department of Defense 's Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) Task Force, suggested that UFOs are drawn to areas where advanced military technology and nuclear warheads are present.According to Grusch, ""There are quite a few things we can’t explain... It’s not a leap to say that these objects are interested in the pinnacle of our technological achievements.""Grusch's statements have reignited public curiosity and debate about the existence of extraterrestrial life and their potential interest in human military advancements. The former official emphasized that many of these sightings have occurred near military installations and during significant test flights.Adding to the intrigue, Grusch highlighted the correlation between UFO sightings and locations with a high concentration of nuclear weapons, suggesting that these objects might be monitoring our nuclear capabilities. He noted, ""We’ve had incidents where these objects have interfered with our nuclear capabilities.""Key reasons behind UFOs reportedly targeting high-speed planes :Advanced drones or electronic warfare systems: Some experts speculate the UFOs could be highly advanced drones or electronic warfare systems deployed by rival powers like Russia or China to gather intelligence on US military capabilities. However, the Pentagon has not confirmed the origin of these objects.Classified US government technology: ThePentagon report dismissed the possibility of the UFOs being linked to classified US government or Pentagon projects. However, the advanced flight characteristics exhibited, such as accelerating to hypersonic speeds over 5 times the speed of sound and performing seemingly impossible maneuvers, suggest they could be experimental US aircraft not publicly acknowledged.Extraterrestrial Craft: While the Pentagon report did not mention extraterrestrials, some believe the UFOs could be alien spacecraft from distant planets or galaxies. However, the report concluded the evidence analyzed does not support the notion of alien originsNatural phenomena or misidentification: Some skeptics argue the UFO sightings could be caused by natural atmospheric phenomena, misidentification of known objects, or hoaxes.These revelations have prompted calls for greater transparency and further investigation into the nature of these unexplained phenomena. The US government has recently declassified several reports and videos showing unidentified objects performing maneuvers that defy current technological understanding.As the debate continues, experts and officials urge the public to keep an open mind. Grusch concluded, ""We need to continue to collect and analyze data. The truth is out there, and we must be willing to seek it.""","David Grusch, a former senior intelligence official, said UFOs are drawn to areas where advanced military technology and nuclear warheads are present.

'We have one job'

Cornered by the age question, President Joe Biden found some time for humor as he said to one supporter in Pennsylvania that Dark Brandon is coming back. For the uninitiated, Dark Brandon is president's cool, laser-eyed internet avatar -- a successful meme campaign of the Democrats. Besieged by the detractors and also supporters urging him to opt out of the race, does Biden think Dark Brandon will come to his rescue?Dark Brandon was born on the Internet but was embraced by Joe Biden as Biden's cool alter-ego helped the party reach the youngsters with Biden's success stories.Dark Brandon has its line of merchandise -- quite popular among youngsters.According to reports, Dark Brandon came to existence during the 2020 election -- was created by Chinese illustrator Yang Quan. He visualized Biden as the laser-eyed super hero after he defeated Trump in the election but it was only in 2022 that Dark Brandon went places.Hours after Biden announced that Dark Brandon will be back, Biden supporters started sharing his byte on Morning Joe where Biden sounded resolute and defiant.“I’m getting frustrated by the elites in the party, ‘Oh, they know so much more,’” Biden said on the MSNBC morning show. “Any of these guys that don’t think I should run, run against me. Announce for president, challenge me at the convention.”“I don’t think what those big names think,” Biden said. “They were wrong in 2020. They were wrong in 2022 about the red wave. They’re wrong in 2024.” “I am not letting up,” Biden said.“This is a guy who’s an extreme candidate. I can’t think of a candidate in my lifetime who’s been more extreme,"" the president said. ""He makes George Wallace look like a patriot.”The Morning Joe interview came as Biden released letter Monday morning addressed to the Democrats assuring them that he is in the race to win.

Could Kamala Harris defeat Donald Trump in the US presidential election?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/could-kamala-harris-defeat-donald-trump-in-the-us-presidential-election/articleshow/111584723.cms,"What has sparked the discussion about Biden stepping aside for Harris?

Why do some believe Kamala Harris could be a strong candidate?

How does Harris perform against Trump in recent polls?

What challenges might Harris face if she were the nominee?

What do Harris's supporters say about her capabilities in a debate against Trump?

What is the overall sentiment among Democrats about Harris replacing Biden?

As President Joe Biden continues his campaign for reelection, there are growing concerns within the Democratic Party about his viability as a candidate due to his age and performance during the first debate against Donald Trump . Some Democratic leaders and supporters have suggested that Vice President Kamala Harris might be a better option to face off against Trump in the 2024 election.This has led to a debate about whether Harris could defeat Trump if Biden were to step aside.Here is all you need to know about prospects and chances of Harris if she contests against Trump:The discussion gained momentum after President Biden faced intensified scrutiny regarding his fitness for another term. During a recent campaign trip in Pennsylvania, Biden urged unity among his supporters, but some leading congressional Democrats privately suggested it might be time for him to abandon his reelection bid. As the party remains divided, with some Democrats advocating for Biden to stay and others urging him to step aside, the possibility of Harris stepping in as the candidate has become a significant topic of conversation.Supporters of Harris argue that she has the potential to energize key Democratic-leaning groups, including Black voters , young voters, and those dissatisfied with Biden's handling of certain issues. Harris has also become a prominent voice on reproductive rights following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v Wade. Former Democratic Congressman Tim Ryan stated, ""She would energize the Black, brown, and Asian Pacific members of our coalition...she would immediately pull the dispirited youth of our country back into the fold.""Recent polls suggest that Harris could fare better against Trump than Biden. A CNN poll found that while Trump leads Biden by six percentage points (49% to 43%), Harris trails Trump by a narrower margin (47% to 45%), within the margin of error. Another Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Harris and Trump nearly tied, with 42% supporting Harris and 43% backing Trump. Harris also showed strength among independents and moderate voters in these polls.Harris's tenure as Vice President has had its ups and downs, with early challenges and criticisms, particularly regarding her handling of immigration and voting rights issues. Some Democratic donors worry about her association with the far-left wing of the party, which they believe could alienate moderate and independent voters. Dmitri Mehlhorn, a fundraiser and adviser, said, ""Her greatest weakness is that her public brand has been associated with the far left wing of the Democratic Party ... and the left wing of the Democratic party cannot win a national election.""Supporters believe Harris's prosecutorial background could be a significant advantage in a head-to-head debate with Trump. Dmitri Mehlhorn commented, ""She is incredibly focused and forceful and smart, and if she prosecutes the case against the criminality of Donald Trump, she will rip him apart.""While there is no consensus, influential Democrats like House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Rep Jim Clyburn have indicated that Harris could be the best option if Biden steps aside. Civil rights leader Rev. Al Sharpton emphasized Harris's loyalty and the potential consequences of bypassing her, stating, “She’s a loyal Democrat. I think the question is whether the Democratic Party will be loyal to women and loyal to Blacks, who have been loyal to them as symbolized by her.”",Some Democratic leaders and supporters have suggested that Vice President Kamala Harris might be a better option to face off against Donald Trump in the 2024 election.

He emphasised the concerns expressed by his legal team about the CJ’s infrequent attendance, reflecting a growing sentiment in his camp that justice might not be administered fairly in these circumstances.Imran also expressed disappointment over a cancelled meeting with his legal and political teams. The superintendent, allegedly at the request of a jailed colonel, denied Khan’s team access, citing operational reasons.“They (Pakistan’s powerful military authorities) are mistaken; they think my party will weaken. They don't realize that the party with the strongest voter base remains strong,” Imran said while asserting his party’s resilience.He emphasised that the IMF cannot solve the country’s issues and that the solution lies in fair and transparent elections. “The entire nation states that the biggest fraud (Feb 2024 national and provincial polls) occurred, yet the chief justice is defending the election commission. The electoral watchdog has committed the greatest fraud in the country. We are seeking justice. If investigations proceed, the chief election commissioner will face Article 6 (guilty of high treason).”“I will never succumb to the tyranny of time; I am prepared to die in jail. As long as I live, I will wage this battle,” Imran remarked.About national security, he highlighted the necessity of a strong relationship with Afghanistan. “Why did Bilawal Bhutto and our foreign minister not visit Afghanistan? Without support from the Afghan govt, we cannot win this war (against TTP) across a 2,500-km-long border,” he added.","Imran cites ongoing concerns over Justice Isa’s involvement in benches handling PTI cases and his personal cases.
