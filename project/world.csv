'Physically tired and mentally retired': Prashant Kishor's jibe at Bihar CM Nitish Kumar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/physically-tired-and-mentally-retired-prashant-kishors-jibe-at-bihar-cm-nitish-kumar/articleshow/118614804.cms,"Nitish Kumar (left) and Prashant Kishor

NEW DELHI: Political strategist-turned-activist Prashant Kishor on Thursday urged voters to ensure that Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar ’s party, the JD(U), does not win any seats in the upcoming assembly elections. He described Kumar as ""physically tired and mentally retired"" and accused him of staying in power by frequently switching alliances.Speaking to reporters in Patna, Kishor said Kumar had remained chief minister despite the JD(U) having only a small number of seats by shifting alliances. He recalled that Kumar broke ties with the BJP in 2013, later joined the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan in 2015, returned to the BJP in 2017, moved back to the RJD camp in 2022, and then rejoined the NDA last year.""To break this cycle, and to ensure that the arrow (JD(U)'s poll symbol) does not float with the lotus (BJP) nor burn bright with the lantern (RJD), I appeal to the people that they vote in a manner that the JD(U) does not win even one seat. Only then would we be rid of the chief minister who is physically tired and mentally retired,"" Kishor said.Moreover, Prashant Kishor, a former JD(U) national vice president, also criticized the BJP, saying it was using Nitish Kumar as a ""mask"" while holding power. He alleged that the recent cabinet expansion, just months before the elections, was aimed at misusing public money and appeasing certain castes.""Swearing in 7 new ministers 6 months before the term of this government ends simply means that they want to loot the people before tenure of the government ends,"" Prashant Kishor said.Also read: Bihar Cabinet expansion: CM Nitish Kumar allocates portfolios to 7 newly-inducted BJP MLAs Claiming that the people were dissatisfied with both the ruling NDA and the RJD-led opposition, Kishor announced plans for a ""Badlo Bihar Rally"" on April 11. ""We have written to the district administration in Patna, asking for permission to hold the rally on April 11. I wager that the turnout will break all records. Though we also foresee the possibility of the jittery in the ruling dispensation trying to pave hurdles by denying permission,"" he said.Kishor was also asked about recent statements by the chief minister’s son, Nishant Kumar, who has insisted that his father is ""100 per cent"" fit and capable of serving another term. This has led to speculation about Nishant’s possible entry into politics.Responding to this, Kishor said, ""I do not want to say much about Nishant since he is not in public life. But I challenge his father to spell out the names of ministers in the state cabinet without looking at a piece of paper. If Nitish Kumar thus demonstrates his mental soundness, I would give up politics and start working for him.""Recently, Kishor was arrested while on a fast demanding the cancellation of the BPSC exams.","Political strategist-turned-activist Prashant Kishor urged voters to ensure that Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar ’s party, the JD(U), does not win any seats in the upcoming assembly elections.

NEW DELHI: A 26-year-old woman was allegedly raped inside a parked bus at Pune’s Swargate bus depot in the early hours of February 25. The victim, a working woman, was waiting for a bus to return to her home in Phaltan, about 100 km away, when the accused, Dattatray Ramdas Gade , approached her. He falsely told her that the bus to her destination was parked elsewhere and led her to an empty Shivshahi bus inside the depot. After convincing her to board, he followed her inside, where he allegedly committed the crime before fleeing the scene.Maharashtra’s transport minister, Pratap Sarnaik, has ordered a departmental inquiry. Both the Assistant Transport Superintendent and the Bus Depot Manager are under investigation, with instructions for suspension if negligence is found. In response, the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) has decided to replace all security personnel at the depot.The Pune city police have released a poster of the suspect, urging the public to come forward with information.The poster mentions that a case under section 64, 351(2) of 2023 has been registered against the accused.As per the poster, ""A case has been registered under section 64, 351(2) of 2023 and the said case is accused named Dattatray Ramdas Gade, age 37 years, Res.

DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand HC on Thursday asked the state whether fresh suggestions should be invited and amendments considered for Uniform Civil Code (UCC). A division bench of Justices Manoj Tiwari and Ashish Naithani made the observation while hearing two petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the UCC Act and Rules. One petition was filed by activists, including Uma Bhatt, and another by a live-in couple. The court directed the state to file a counter by April 1.Advocate Vrinda Grover, appearing for the petitioners, argued the UCC creates an ""excessive surveillance regime, policing personal choices within the right to privacy ."" She contended that it establishes a framework for inquiry, authorisation, and penalisation of partner choices. The court asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta whether the state should reconsider its provisions.Chief standing counsel C S Rawat said the court orally asked the SG to request the state legislature to implement necessary modifications. Grover said the law, presented as a safeguard for women, could lead to harassment and social coercion.

Probe by CID into Badlapur encounter to continue: Judge

MUMBAI: In partial relief to five policemen indicted for the custodial death of an accused in the Badlapur school sexual assault case , a sessions court has ""kept in abeyance"" findings of a magisterial inquiry questioning legitimacy of the alleged encounter.Thane additional sessions judge D R Deshpande agreed that the magistrate's findings appear to be ""in excess of jurisdiction"" and that if they take effect it may render any revision application filed by indicted cops ""a futile exercise"". He asked the govt to keep the report, particularly paragraphs 81 and 82, in abeyance till the next hearing.Para 81 questioned whether use of force was justified and emphasized that the policemen were in a position where they could have better handled the situation, while para 82 said there were grounds of suspicion regarding their action if forensic reports were considered.The judge has directed that the probe by the crime investigation department (CID) into the custodial death should continue as it was being done independent of the report. The five indicted cops include a senior inspector, an assistant inspector, a head constable and two constables.Akshay Shinde, who was arrested in Aug 2024 for allegedly sexually assaulting two minor girls in the toilet of a school, was shot dead in a police van on Sept 23 while being taken from Taloja jail to Navi Mumbai for questioning. He was an attendant at the school.Police claimed he snatched a gun, opened fire, and was killed in retaliatory firing. The magistrate had raised doubts on the policemen’s claims of opening fire in selfdefence. His report said there was substance in the allegation by the dead man’s parents that it was a fake encounter.The indicted cops filed a revision application before sessions court, questioning the findings. They argued that the magistrate’s role was limited to determining cause of death and an inquiry transcending this purview to assess evidence and record findings was erroneous under Section 196 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita. They urged the court to quash and set aside the “unwarranted findings”, saying the magistrate “overstepped his jurisdiction” by indicting them.A lawyer for one of the cops sought that the effect and operation of the findings be stayed to prevent prejudice to him.Special public prosecutor Ajay Misar submitted that the CID was probing the matter independent of the report. Taking the sessions court through the magistrate’s report, he said the “sort of confusion created due to inconsistency occurring in scientific evidence vis-a-vis the indisputable facts” necessitate “assistance of further scientific tools and tests”.The court said it would keep the findings in abeyance till the next hearing, but the CID probe should continue. The order noted a policeman’s apprehension that the findings may impede his legal rights and said addressing the apprehension was “needful”. The court said the accused's family must also be given an opportunity to be heard or oppose the revision application. Findings which “appear” to be “in excess of jurisdiction” have to be kept in abeyance until the family is heard, the judge said.It then directed the policemen to implead the accused’s parents as respondents and issued notice to them. The court posted the matter for further hearing on March 5.","Akshay Shinde, who was arrested in Aug 2024 for allegedly sexually assaulting two minor girls in the toilet of a school, was shot dead in a police van on Sept 23 while being taken from Taloja jail to Navi Mumbai for questioning.

The Utah social media influencer gained fame through her YouTube channel 8 Passengers, where she documented life with her husband and children.However, reality was far from wholesome, as Ruby imposed a series of harsh punishments on her kids: ranging from the claims that they were possessed by demons to forcing them to manual labour under the scorching sun.Their accounts are part of Hulu’s newly released three-part docuseries, Devil in the Family: The Fall of Ruby Franke, which premiered on Thursday.The series includes testimonies from Ruby’s estranged family, including her soon-to-be ex-husband Kevin, their eldest daughter Shari, 21, and son Chad, 20.In the first episode, the two siblings detailed the harsh reality of life behind the camera, describing a home filled with fear and violence.Shari recalled watching her younger brother suffer brutal punishments, “I did always feel bad when he got in trouble,” adding, “ He’d get a bloody nose and I'd bring him toilet paper and didn't really know what to do.”She further revealed that one time he got beaten up so bad that she had to help him to clean his blood off the walls.Sharing his own years-long ordeal, Chad revealed that his mother often disciplined him for not listening to adults, describing how she would “blow up off camera”, using physical violence to assert control.“She would spank, whip, take the belt out and whip my butt. Pull down my pants, whip me,” he said.Ruby forced her son to perform long tiring physical tasks outside in the summer heat without shoes or sufficient water, leaving him with severe and repeated sunburns. He was also denied proper meals, only given plain food while the rest of the family ate more flavourful dishes.The abuse continued until her arrest in August 2023, after which her four minor children were taken into the custody of child protective services , as per the Independent.Her husband, Kevin Franke told People that he is ready for divorce and is trying to reach a settlement.Ruby Franke and her business partner, Jodi Hildebrandt, were sentenced last year to up to 30 years in prison after pleading guilty to four counts of aggravated child abuse. Court documents revealed that they subjected Ruby’s two youngest children to extreme punishments, convincing them they were “evil” and “possessed by demons” as justification for the abuse.Following her arrest in 2023, Ruby admitted to a series of shocking acts, describing them as “acts of love” in a statement supporting her guilty plea.","Chad and Shari Franke, children of former family vlogger Ruby Franke with almost 2.5 million subscribers, gave a glimpse into the horrifying life they suffered at the hands of their mother.

When to expect election results



Ontarians head to the polls today to elect a new government, with voting open from 9 am to 9 pm across more than 7,000 polling stations. Premier Doug Ford’s Progressive Conservative Party is seeking re-election, facing challenges from Bonnie Crombie’s Liberals and Marit Stiles’ New Democrats. The election has largely been shaped by economic concerns, health care, housing, and an unexpected international factor— US President Donald Trump’s threats of tariffs on Canadian exports.Voters can cast their ballots at designated locations, including schools, community centres, and places of worship. Elections Ontario provides an online tool to help voters find their polling stations based on their postal codes. Those without a fixed address can use the place they have most frequently eaten or slept in the last five weeks as their voting address.Voters must present identification at polling stations, but a photo ID is not mandatory. If a voter information card has been issued, a range of documents, such as a birth certificate, health card, or student ID, can be used. Without a voter card, ID must include both name and address, such as a driver’s licence or utility bill.While Elections Ontario has not predicted long lines, this marks Ontario’s first winter election since the 1920s. Harsh weather, including snow and freezing temperatures, may impact voter turnout and transportation to polling sites. Forecasts suggest a high of 3°C and a low of -6°C in the Greater Toronto Area, with a 60% chance of rain or snow.Premier Doug Ford, leader of the Progressive Conservatives, is seeking a second term after winning in 2018. His campaign has centred on lowering taxes, economic growth, and protecting Ontario’s economy from potential US tariffs. Ford’s main challengers are Bonnie Crombie of the Liberal Party, focusing on health care expansion, and Marit Stiles of the NDP, prioritizing education funding and student debt relief.International trade tensions have unexpectedly dominated the election narrative. Trump has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on Canadian goods unless border security measures are strengthened. Ford has responded by campaigning against the prospect of Ontario becoming economically vulnerable, branding his campaign with the slogan “Canada Is Not For Sale.” His opponents argue that Ontario alone cannot negotiate with the US , and any response would primarily fall under the federal government’s jurisdiction.In past elections, results were called within 30 to 90 minutes after polls closed. With Ford leading in recent polls, analysts suggest a quick result is likely. Full results will be available on Elections Ontario’s website, and networks are expected to declare the winner before midnight.As Ontarians vote, the outcome will shape the province’s political landscape and determine its response to economic and social challenges in the years ahead.","Voters can cast their ballots at designated locations, including schools, community centres, and places of worship.

'No authority': US judge blocks Trump admin's calls for mass firings of federal workers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-authority-us-judge-blocks-trump-admins-calls-for-mass-firings-of-federal-workers/articleshow/118614984.cms,"Donald Trump, Protesters (AP photo)

A federal judge on Thursday ordered the US government to reverse mass firings of probationary federal employees, ruling that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) lacked the authority to direct such terminations. The decision is a legal setback for US President Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s plan to downsize the federal workforce.US district judge William Alsup, presiding over the case in San Francisco, directed the OPM to withdraw directives sent to various federal agencies that resulted in thousands of employees being laid off.""The Office of Personnel Management does not have any authority whatsoever under any statute in the history of the universe to hire and fire employees at another agency,"" Alsup said, according to The Washington Post.The ruling follows lawsuits filed by labor unions and advocacy groups that argued federal agencies had been illegally instructed to terminate all probationary employees. Under federal employment laws, a worker in their first or second year of employment is considered probationary, even if promoted from a lower rank. Tens of thousands of workers were affected by the move.""OPM, the federal agency charged with implementing this nation's employment laws, in one fell swoop has perpetrated one of the most massive employment frauds in the history of this country,"" a plaintiffs' legal filing stated, according to The Washington Post.The government acknowledged that OPM does not have hiring or firing authority over other agencies but argued that the office had only requested agencies review probationary employees’ performance and determine their suitability for continued employment.“I think plaintiffs are conflating a request by OPM with an order by OPM,” said Kelsey Helland, an assistant US attorney, in court Thursday.However, Judge Alsup was unconvinced, stating that OPM’s communications to agencies carried the weight of an order. He instructed the acting head of the agency, Charles Ezell, to testify about a February 13 phone call in which agency heads were reportedly told to proceed with terminations.“The agencies could thumb their noses at OPM if they wanted to if it’s guidance, but if it’s an order, or cast as an order, the agencies may think they have to comply,” Alsup said.Elon Musk, through the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, has spearheaded the effort to streamline the federal workforce. His initiatives have included demands such as a Saturday email requiring federal workers to list five tasks they had completed the previous week or risk termination. The OPM later clarified that the directive was voluntary, though similar performance evaluations could be expected in the future.Unions and advocacy groups welcomed the ruling, viewing it as a crucial victory against what they described as an illegal attempt to purge the federal workforce.“This ruling by Judge Alsup is an important initial victory for patriotic Americans across this country who were illegally fired from their jobs by an agency that had no authority to do so,” said Everett Kelley, national president of the American Federation of Government Employees.“These are rank-and-file workers who joined the federal government to make a difference in their communities, only to be suddenly terminated due to this administration’s disdain for federal employees and desire to privatize their work.”Despite the ruling, it remains unclear whether fired employees will be reinstated or if future layoffs will be prevented. Alsup noted that while unions may lack legal standing to sue, nonprofit organizations involved in the lawsuit likely have a case, as their members would suffer from reduced government services due to staff reductions.“Probationary employees are the lifeblood of our government,” Alsup said, adding that these workers represent younger employees who progress through the ranks.The judge plans to issue a written order, with an evidentiary hearing scheduled for March 13.","A federal judge on Thursday ordered the US government to reverse mass firings of probationary federal employees.

FBI pledges full transparency



Epstein’s past and upcoming auctions of documents

The Justice Department on Thursday released a cache of documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, including his contact list, flight logs, and evidence gathered against him. However, the approximately 200-page document did not reveal any major new details, largely reaffirming previous reports about Epstein’s high-profile associations.Among the names found in the contact list released by the DOJ were Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger, actor Alec Baldwin, pop star Michael Jackson, Ethel Kennedy—mother of Robert F Kennedy Jr, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, supermodel Naomi Campbell, and musician Courtney Love. Others listed included Bob Weinstein, brother of disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein; billionaire David Koch; late Sen. Ted Kennedy; actor Ralph Fiennes; lawyer Alan Dershowitz; former Secretary of State John Kerry; actor Dustin Hoffman; businessman Jon Huntsman; Ivana and Ivanka Trump; and model Liz Hurley. The list was redacted to remove personal contact details.While the document release provided insight into Epstein’s network, it was not a “client list” and did not confirm any direct involvement of the listed individuals in illegal activities. The DOJ also included a redacted list of 254 masseuses, blacking out their names as they were considered victims. Additionally, the binder contained flight logs from Epstein’s private jet, the “Lolita Express,” which had previously been made public with redactions.The release, described as ""Phase One,"" was met with frustration by those expecting significant revelations. Conservative commentator Liz Wheeler, who was given early access to the documents, told followers in a livestream, “We’re all waiting for bombshells… and that’s not what’s in this binder at all.”Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.), who leads a House GOP task force on government transparency, also criticised the release. “THIS IS NOT WHAT WE OR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ASKED FOR and a complete disappointment. GET US THE INFORMATION WE ASKED FOR!” she tweeted.Attorney General Pam Bondi claimed that a witness informed her the FBI's New York field office had demanded access to additional materials. She has given the FBI a deadline of Friday to provide the outstanding documents.FBI director Kash Patel assured the public that there would be “no cover-ups, no missing documents, and no stone left unturned.” He vowed that if any records had been concealed, they would be uncovered and transparently shared with the DOJ.Epstein’s “little black book” had previously surfaced in legal proceedings and was made public in 2015. That version, dated 2004-2005, included names such as former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Prince Andrew, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, singer Jimmy Buffet, and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. A separate 1990s-era book later surfaced, containing 349 names, including figures not in the 2015 version, such as President Trump, billionaire Carl Icahn, and former New Republic publisher Marty Peretz.Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to child prostitution charges in Florida and served a 13-month sentence under a controversial work-release arrangement.A copy of Epstein’s 1990s contact book was discovered on Fifth Avenue in New York and later sold on eBay for $425. The buyer, Vermont social studies teacher Christopher Helali, now plans to auction it in March, expecting it to fetch up to $50,000.It remains unclear whether additional Epstein-related files will be released, but the naming of the binder as “Phase One” suggests more disclosures could follow.","The Justice Department on Thursday released a cache of documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Political and trade implications



Targeting Caro Quintero



Cartel retaliation concerns



Mexico extradited 29 high-profile drug cartel figures, including notorious drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero, to the United States. Caro Quintero, accused of orchestrating the 1985 murder of US DEA agent Enrique ""Kiki"" Camarena, was among those sent to the US on Thursday as President Donald Trump’s administration ramped up pressure on Mexico to combat drug trafficking The transfers took place as top Mexican officials visited Washington, seeking to prevent Trump’s threat of imposing 25% tariffs on Mexican imports. The cartel members were flown from multiple prisons in Mexico to eight US cities, according to the Mexican government.The extradited individuals included members of five of the six Mexican drug cartels that the Trump administration recently designated as “foreign terrorist organizations.” Among them was Vicente Carrillo Fuentes, a former leader of the Juarez Cartel and brother of Amado Carrillo Fuentes, also known as ""The Lord of the Skies,"" who died in a botched plastic surgery operation in 1997.According to prosecutors in both countries, the individuals extradited face charges related to drug trafficking, homicide, and other serious crimes.“We will prosecute these criminals to the fullest extent of the law in honor of the brave law enforcement agents who have dedicated their careers — and in some cases, given their lives — to protect innocent people from the scourge of violent cartels,"" US Attorney General Pamela Bondi stated.The move coincided with a visit to Washington by Mexico’s Foreign Affairs Secretary Juan Ramón de la Fuente, who, along with other top officials, met with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Trump had demanded that Mexico take tougher action against cartels, illegal immigration, and fentanyl production as a condition for delaying trade tariffs.“This is historical, this has really never happened in the history of Mexico,” said Mike Vigil, former DEA chief of international operations. “This is a huge celebratory thing for the Drug Enforcement Administration.”Caro Quintero had been a top priority for US law enforcement. The former Guadalajara cartel leader was released from prison in 2013 after a Mexican court overturned his sentence for Camarena’s killing. He later returned to drug trafficking, engaging in violent turf wars in Mexico’s Sonora state before his re-arrest in 2022.His extradition had been delayed, but pressure from Trump, including the threat of tariffs and the designation of cartels as terrorist groups, expedited the process. A nonprofit group representing the Camarena family had also petitioned the White House to push for Caro Quintero’s extradition.“This moment is extremely personal for the men and women of DEA who believe Caro Quintero is responsible for the brutal torture and murder of DEA Special Agent Enrique ‘Kiki’ Camarena,"" said DEA acting chief Derek Maltz.According to sources, Mexico’s government under President Claudia Sheinbaum bypassed the formal US -Mexico extradition treaty in an effort to strengthen ties with Washington. This move could allow US prosecutors to try Caro Quintero for Camarena’s murder, rather than just the drug trafficking charges originally specified in the extradition request.“If he’s being sent to the US outside of a formal extradition, and if Mexico didn’t place any restrictions, then he can be prosecuted for whatever the US wants,” said former federal narcotics prosecutor Bonnie Klapper.Also among those extradited were Miguel Treviño Morales and Omar Treviño Morales, former leaders of the now-defunct Los Zetas cartel, who had continued to run the successor Northeast Cartel from prison.Mexican security analyst David Saucedo described the extraditions as “an important concession” to the US , warning that the move could provoke cartel backlash against the Mexican government.“There will surely be a furious reaction by drug trafficking groups against the Mexican state,” Saucedo said.","Mexico extradited 29 high-profile drug cartel figures, including notorious drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero, to the United States.

'Worst-case scenario for Starmer'

Keir Starmer vs Donald Trump Press Conference | The White House

When UK PM Keir Starmer met US President Donald Trump at the White House for high-stakes talks on bilateral relations , the contrast between the two leaders was evident before they even spoke a word. From handshakes to subtle gestures, body language experts say the meeting revealed much about their personalities and power dynamics, reports the Mirror.Trump was described as “totally relaxed” and “grounded” by body language expert Caroline Goyder who dominated the encounter. “Trump is the silverback, totally at ease, on his home turf. The difference couldn’t be starker,” Goyder told ITV. “Whatever you think about Donald Trump, he is Mr Charisma with Mr Logic... Mr Legal. And so it's amazing, It's like Mars and Venus.”By contrast, Goyder observed that Starmer looked like a “boy in his new school uniform” when arriving at the White House. The British PM appeared stiff and slightly uneasy, even pulling at his sleeves as if adjusting to the moment. During their conversation in the Oval Office, Starmer was seen touching his stomach, which Goyder interpreted as a “self-soothing” gesture.Trump, who has long used physical gestures to assert dominance over world leaders, wasted no time in setting the tone. At one point, he appeared to mock Starmer by asking if the UK could take on Russia “on your own?” The British PM, however, pushed back when Trump claimed European nations would be reimbursed for their Ukraine war contributions while the US would not. Starmer pointed out: “We're not getting all of ours. Quite a bit of ours was gifted, it was given, there were some loans, but mainly it was gifted, actually.”According to body language expert Judi James, Trump’s tactics were predictable. Speaking to The Mirror, she described his handshakes as “a bottomless buffet of lowering techniques,” often designed to leave opponents off-balance.“His shake and yank is the most lethal ritual, as he will grab the hand then suddenly and quite violently yank it toward or away from him, leaving the other person de-stabilised and fighting to keep their balance,” James explained. “He will also power-pat to register superiority.”Trump’s history with world leaders is filled with such moments. When he met Theresa May, he held her hand in a way that made it appear overly familiar. With Boris Johnson , he made him descend a staircase as if he were a debutante at a ball. French President Emmanuel Macron once crushed Trump’s hand so hard that the imprint lingered on his skin. When they met again earlier this week, Macron playfully pushed Trump’s hand away when the US leader placed it on his knee—only for Trump to slap it back down in a show of defiance. “Trump will, of course, play dirty if pushed,” James noted.James believes Starmer had planned to project an air of authority during the meeting, but his naturally measured style may have worked against him. “Starmer will almost certainly be wanting to stamp some sense of his own alpha leadership power on their body language rituals too,” she said. However, his approach contrasts with Trump’s aggressive style.James suggested Starmer take cues from the Royal Family, who project confidence without direct confrontation. “Prince Philip always turned on some upper-class charm but with an asymmetric smile and an eye twinkle that suggested he was chuckling inside. Prince William tends to use a more bashful charm but makes his status look like a given. The royals would never enter any hand-wrestling contests because they always keep their dignity and therefore their status.”While Starmer aimed to establish himself as a strong leader on the world stage, James warned that Trump’s ultimate power move could be simply appearing disinterested. “Trump only puts in body language effort when he feels an opponent is worth it,” she said.“If he just adopts a polite lip-clamped smile, sits slumped with his hands between his knees, tapping his fingertips together in a gesture of impatience and trots out some cliché about Starmer being ‘someone I can do business with’, it could be the worst of all the options.”The meeting was seen as a test of Starmer’s diplomacy, with Ukraine high on the agenda. The Prime Minister urged Trump to back a security guarantee for Ukraine, warning that without US support, Vladimir Putin could strike again. However, in the battle of body language, experts say it was clear who had the upper hand. “Trump is all about charisma,” said Goyder. “Starmer needs to meet him on that level if he wants to hold his own.”",UK PM Keir Starmer met US President Donald Trump at the White House for high- stakes talks on bilateral relations.

RIO DE JANEIRO: For a man charged with masterminding an attempted coup and banned from public office, Brazil's far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro appears remarkably serene about his political future.As he sees it, if US President Donald Trump could overcome crushing legal woes to make his way back into power, why can't he?""I am calm... I don't give a damn about prison,"" Bolsonaro, 69, said last week after being charged for allegedly plotting to oust President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva after 2022 elections.Buoyed by the global strengthening of the far-right, Bolsonaro is lobbying for Trump to turn up the pressure on Brazilian authorities to halt what he terms legal persecution against him.The firebrand conservative has expressed confidence that Trump would use his influence to intervene on his behalf.""He won't accept that certain people around the world persecute their opponents,"" he told reporters in January.Trump has said the two men are ""great friends"" and described Bolsonaro as a ""great gentleman"" at last week's annual conservative convention in the US.Bolsonaro is awaiting a Supreme Court decision on whether to try him over the alleged coup plot -- charges which carry a jail term of up to 40 years.He is also trying to get Congress to reduce his ban on running for office until 2030, imposed over his repeated attacks on Brazil's voting system.- US targets powerful Brazilian judge -Political analyst Guilherme Casaroes of the Getulio Vargas Foundation said Bolsonaro's hopes of being able to run again ""sound far-fetched at this point.""Nevertheless, ""there are ways through which the Trump administration might try and exert some pressure on the Brazilian authorities,"" such as sanctions.The main target appears to be powerful Supreme Court judge Alexandre de Moraes , who is leading the case against Bolsonaro.Moraes is also spearheading a crackdown on online disinformation which has put him in the crosshairs of Trump's right-hand man and X social network owner Elon Musk.The judge has ordered the suspension of social media accounts accused of spreading hate speech on X and the conservative Rumble video outlet.Last week he suspended Rumble in Brazil, after shutting X down for 40 days last year for failing to comply with court orders.The US State Department warned on X this week that his actions were ""incompatible with democratic values, including freedom of expression.""Brazil hit back, rejecting ""any attempt to politicize judicial decisions.""Bolsonaro's son, the lawmaker Eduardo Bolsonaro, has made several trips to the US to plead his father's case to Republicans and push for sanctions against Moraes.On Wednesday, a US judicial committee approved a bill it said was inspired by Moraes, that could block foreign officials from the United States if they try and censor local companies.- Rising from the ashes? -Despite the campaign against Brazil in the US, Lucas Leite, an international relations professor at the Armando Alvares Penteado Foundation in Sao Paulo, believes it will be more difficult for Bolsonaro to make a comeback than Trump.Bolsonaro ""should be much more concerned"" than he appears, he said.""The only way for him to really escape would be through an amnesty via Congress, some political pact between the main parties, but I very much doubt that will happen.""I think it is very likely that he will be convicted before 2026,"" so as not to ""contaminate"" the electoral race, he added.When Bolsonaro came to power in 2019, two years after Trump, his bombastic rhetoric and style saw him dubbed the ""Trump of the Tropics.""Bolsonaro has doubled down on the comparison in recent weeks, regularly comparing his knifing at a 2018 campaign rally to Trump's brush with assassination, when a bullet nicked his ear.He also recalls how both their supporters stormed government buildings two years apart in indignation over what they saw as stolen elections.""Bolsonaro is trying to reinforce this political, nationalist identity, this rhetoric that is very Trumpist and that mobilizes people very strongly,"" said Leite.His supporters are optimistic.""Trump returned to power, rose from the ashes like a Phoenix, so I believe that Bolsonaro, even with all this persecution, will also return to power in 2026,"" seamstress and Bolsonaro supporter Silvia Lucia Soares, 61, told AFP.",Brazil's far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro appears remarkably serene about his political future.

BRUSSELS: The European Union on Thursday pushed back hard against allegations by U.S. President Donald Trump that the 27-nation bloc was out to get the United States, and warned that it would vigorously fight any wholesale tariff of 25% on all EU products.The tit-for-tat dispute following the comments of Trump, which were aimed at an age-old ally and its main postwar economic partner, further deepened the trans-Atlantic rift that was already widened by Trump's warnings that Washington would drop security guarantees for its European allies.Thursday's EU pushback came after Trump told reporters that ""the European Union was formed in order to screw the United States. That's the purpose of it, and they've done a good job of it,"" adding that it would stop immediately under his presidency.Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland, which holds the EU's rotating presidency, went on a counteroffensive.""The EU wasn't formed to screw anyone,"" Tusk said in an X post. ""Quite the opposite. It was formed to maintain peace, to build respect among our nations, to create free and fair trade, and to strengthen our transatlantic friendship. As simple as that.""European Parliament President Roberta Metsola was in Washington, where she told an audience at Johns Hopkins University on Thursday that ""we are not out to screw anyone,"" adding that both sides should be ""pulling ourselves up together rather than the opposite.""And Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez added fiery fuel to the debate.""We are going to defend our interests when our economies are attacked with tariffs that are completely unjustified and represent a veiled threat to our economic sovereignty.""We are committed and prepared to do so,"" he said in northern Spain.The EU also warned that the moment that tariffs are announced, it would trigger tough countermeasures on iconic U.S. industries like bourbon, jeans and motorcycles.""The European Union and its member states have been working for months and we are going to adopt measures that are proportional to the challenge,"" Sanchez said.Metsola said that the EU would stand up to the Trump administration if tariffs are announced.""We are very ready for anything. So allow me to be clear: The EU will react firmly and immediately,"" she said. ""We don't want to go down that road - let me be clear - but we are ready.""Trump said in comments late Wednesday that the United States stood equally ready for a standoff.""We are the pot of gold. We're the one that everybody wants. And they can retaliate. But it cannot be a successful retaliation, because we just go cold turkey. We don't buy any more. And if that happens, we win.""The EU estimates that the trade volume between both sides stands at about $1.5 trillion, representing around 30% of global trade. Trump has complained about a trade deficit, but while the bloc has a substantial export surplus in goods, the EU says that is partly offset by the U.S. surplus in the trade of services.The EU says that trade in goods reached 851 billion euros ($878 billion) in 2023, with a trade surplus of 156 billion euros ($161 billion) for the EU. Trade in services was worth 688 billion euros ($710 billion) with a trade deficit of 104 billion euros ($107 billion) for the EU.The figures are so big that it remained essential to avoid a trade war, the EU has said.""We should be talking about trade agreements rather than tariffs,"" Metsola said.","U.S. President Donald Trump said the European Union was out to get the United States.

‘Pretty sick’ information on Epstein to be released

US attorney general Pam Bondi has accused the FBI of withholding a vast trove of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein and is demanding their immediate release.Bondi has revealed that “thousands of pages” from the FBI’s investigation into the convicted sex offender and pedophile were missing from the files handed over to her office, the New York Post reports.In a letter to FBI director Kash Patel, Bondi insisted that the full and unredacted Epstein files be delivered by 8.00 am on Friday. She cited a whistleblower from the FBI’s New York office who claimed that only around 200 pages had been provided, while the majority remained hidden. The batch of documents initially handed over included flight logs, phone numbers, and names of victims. However, an insider warned that hundreds more documents had not been disclosed.“By 800 am tomorrow, February 28, the FBI will deliver the full and complete Epstein files to my office, including all records, documents, audio and video recordings, and materials related to Jeffrey Epstein and his clients, regardless of how such information was obtained,” Bondi wrote.“There will be no withholdings or limitations to my or your access,” she added, making it clear that she expects full transparency.The revelation has sparked fears that crucial evidence could be destroyed. Representative Andy Ogles has already introduced a bill aimed at preventing Epstein-related records from being erased.Ogles wrote to Bondi on Wednesday, revealing he was drafting the Preventing Epstein Documentation Obliteration Act—or the PEDO Act—to safeguard records amid “reports that certain FBI agents are allegedly attempting to destroy critical records.”“Should you encounter any statutory barriers to the expeditious public release of Jeffrey Epstein’s client list or other pertinent information related to his activities… I stand ready to assist,” he wrote.Ogles also pointed out that past government secrecy over high-profile investigations—such as those into the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy—had undermined public trust.Whistleblower and former FBI special agent Garret O’Boyle recently suggested that FBI personnel were working to erase sensitive files.“There are FBI servers,” O’Boyle said in an interview with conservative influencer Benny Johnson. “And people inside the FBI have been working night and day to destroy files on these servers. No idea on what it is—I can only speculate—but you mentioned the Epstein list. I’d imagine it’s cases like that.”The FBI already has several Epstein files available to the public, but The New York Post reported that the department of justice was set to release 100 pages from Epstein’s personal address book on Thursday.Bondi had hinted at the impending release of more Epstein documents during an interview on Jesse Watters Primetime, saying the material the government possesses is “pretty sick” and will “make you sick.”On Thursday, conservative influencers who visited the White House were handed what was described as “Phase 1” of the Epstein files release . They left the West Wing holding binders but did not immediately disclose their contents to the press.Senator Marsha Blackburn has also demanded full disclosure of Epstein-related records.“For years, my efforts to crack the Epstein trafficking ring wide open have been stonewalled by Democrats at every turn,” she posted Monday on X. “This will change under FBI Director Kash Patel. I just sent him a letter asking for the complete & unredacted Epstein files.”Patel had previously assured Blackburn during his confirmation hearing that he would “do everything” to reveal the “full weight” of Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring.",US attorney general Pam Bondi has accused the FBI of withholding a vast trove of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein.

WH press secretary slams NY Times reporter as ‘left-wing stenographer’ over Trump-Putin comparison

Newly appointed White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt hit back at a New York Times journalist after he compared US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin Leavitt called journalist Peter Baker a “left-wing stenographer” after he drew comparisons between Trump’s handling of press access and Putin’s media crackdowns .The exchange unfolded on X after veteran reporter and former Moscow correspondent Peter Baker criticised the administration’s decision to take control of the White House press pool and exclude Associated Press reporters from key events, including access to the Oval Office and Air Force One.The shake-up comes amid growing friction between the Trump administration and media outlets. Just last week, AP journalists were removed from the president’s trip to Mar-a-Lago and Miami after refusing to use the White House’s preferred term, “Gulf of America,” instead of the Gulf of Mexico.Baker took to social media on Tuesday to express his concerns, likening the Trump administration’s move to Kremlin tactics.“Having served as a Moscow correspondent in the early days of Putin’s reign, this reminds me of how the Kremlin took over its own press pool and made sure that only compliant journalists were given access,” he wrote on X.Leavitt swiftly fired back with a clown emoji, followed by a sharp rebuttal.“Give me a break, Peter,” she responded.She pointed out that “moments after” Baker’s X post, Trump had invited journalists into the Oval Office for nearly an hour of questions. Leavitt dismissed Baker’s concerns as “hysterical” and defended the White House’s decision as a necessary change to an outdated system.She then took a direct jab at Baker and the wider media landscape, posting on X she said, “Gone are the days where left-wing stenographers posing as journalists, such as yourself, dictate who gets to ask what.”For decades, the White House Correspondents’ Association (WHCA) has determined press access, deciding which journalists could cover the president most closely. However, that changed earlier this week when Leavitt announced the administration would now take full control of the selection process.“A group of DC-based journalists, the White House Correspondents’ Association, has long dictated which journalists get to ask questions of the President of the United States. Not anymore,” Leavitt said.She called the move a step towards fairness.“Today, I was proud to announce that we are giving the power back to the people,” she said. “Moving forward, the ‘White House Press Pool’ will be determined by the White House Press Team.”Leavitt assured that traditional outlets would not be excluded but insisted that access decisions would now rest with the administration.Baker responded with another sharp critique, suggesting the move was designed to silence tough questioning.“Every president of both parties going back generations subscribed to the principle that a president doesn’t pick the press corps that is allowed in the room to ask him questions,” he wrote. “Trump has just declared that he will.”He vowed that professional journalism would continue as usual.“None of this will stop professional news outlets from covering this president in the same full, fair, tough and unflinching way that we always have. Government efforts to punish disfavoured organisations will not stop independent journalism,” Baker said.“The United States is not Russia by any means, and any comparisons risk going too far… But for those of us who reported there a quarter century ago, Mr Trump’s Washington is bringing back memories of Mr Putin’s Moscow in the early days,” Baker wrote.A New York Times spokesperson also criticised the White House’s new approach.“The White House’s move to handpick favoured reporters to observe the president — and exclude anyone whose coverage the administration may not like — is an effort to undermine the public’s access to independent, trustworthy information about the most powerful person in America,” the newspaper said in a statement.",Newly appointed White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt hit back at a New York Times journalist after he compared US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

US VP JD Vance calls out Keir Starmer to his face on free speech concerns in UK

US Vice President JD Vance tangled with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer during an Oval Office meeting on Thursday, accusing the United Kingdom of ""infringements on free speech "" and arguing that such restrictions impact US tech companies and, American citizens.""I said what I said, which is that we do have, of course, a special relationship with our friends in the UK and also with some of our European allies,"" the Republican vice president said.""But we do have of course a special relationship with our friends in the UK and also our European allies, but we also know there have been infringements on free speech that affect not just the British - what the British do in their own country is up to them - but also affect American technology companies and by extension, American citizens. So that's something we will talk about at lunch,"" he added.In response to the remark, Starmer asserted: ""Well, we’ve had free speech for a very, very long time in the United Kingdom and it will last for a very, very long time. Certainly, we wouldn’t want to reach across US citizens, and we don’t, and that’s absolutely right, but in relation to free speech in the UK I’m very proud of our history there.""Vance doubled down on his free speech concerns, reiterating his earlier remarks at the Munich Security Conference, where he stirred controversy in Europe by warning of ""the threat from within"" and criticizing what he described as Europe’s retreat from its core values—principles it shares with the United States.This meeting took place as President Donald Trump hosted Starmer at the White House for discussions on Ukraine, with the British leader emphasizing the need for continued American leadership in securing peace should the three-year war come to an end.Starmer’s visit follows that of French President Emmanuel Macron, highlighting growing European unease over Trump’s push to swiftly end the conflict, which many fear could lead to concessions favoring Russian President Vladimir Putin.Following private talks, Starmer publicly praised Trump’s efforts to bring the war to a close but cautioned, “It can’t be peace that rewards the aggressor.” Standing alongside Trump, adding that, “History must be on the side of the peacemaker, not the invader,”Starmer also formally invited Trump for a state visit to the UK on behalf of King Charles III—an offer the former president accepted. The prime minister described the invitation as “historic” and “unprecedented,” marking the second time Trump would receive such an honor.","US Vice President JD Vance tangled with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer during an Oval Office meeting on Thursday.

Who are the Tate Brothers?



Andrew Tate and brother arrive in Florida

What are they charged with in Romania?



Why was the travel ban lifted?



What cases they have in Florida?



A travel ban on influencer brothers Andrew and Tristan Tate , both charged with human trafficking in Romania, has been lifted, allowing them to travel to the United States, according to officials on Thursday.The brothers, who are dual US-British citizens are strong supporters of President Donald Trump and their large online following, were granted permission to leave Romania under undisclosed conditions. Their exact destination in the United States remains unknown, the Associated Press reported.Andrew Tate , 38, is a former professional kickboxer who has amassed over 10 million followers on X, where he frequently shares controversial views. He describes himself as a misogynist and operates an online academy that claims to teach young men how to achieve wealth and attract women.Tristan Tate, 36 also a former kickboxer, maintains a strong online presence but is less publicly outspoken than his older brother.The Tate brothers and two Romanian women were arrested in late 2022 in Bucharest.Romania's Directorate for Investigating Organised Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT) accused them of forming a criminal group in 2021 to engage in human trafficking in Romania, the United States, and Britain.The Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism alleged the four defendants formed a criminal group in 2021 ""in order to commit the crime of human trafficking"" in Romania as well as the United States and Britain.They were formally indicted last year, but in December, a Bucharest court ruled that their case could not proceed to trial due to procedural and legal irregularities by prosecutors. While the case remains open, a separate legal investigation into the brothers is also underway in Romania.Andrew Tate has repeatedly denied the charges, calling them part of a political conspiracy designed to silence him. Prosecutors, however, have charged the brothers with leading a criminal gang to sexually exploit women, among other offenses.Romania’s anti-organized crime agency, DIICOT, stated on Thursday that prosecutors had approved a request “to modify the obligation preventing the defendants from leaving Romania.” However, the agency noted that judicial control measures remain in place.The restrictions also require the brothers to ""appear before judicial authorities whenever summoned, and DIICOT warned that any violation of these obligations could lead to stricter legal action, including detention.Their departure follows comments from Romania’s Foreign Minister Emil Hurezeanu, who revealed that a US official from the Trump administration had expressed interest in the Tate case at the recent Munich Security Conference. Hurezeanu, however, denied that this amounted to political pressure, as per Associated Press reports.Meanwhile, in the United States, the Tate brothers are involved in a defamation lawsuit in Florida against a woman who accused them of imprisoning her in Romania.A hearing was held Thursday in West Palm Beach, Florida, regarding a motion from the woman, identified as Jane Doe , requesting an indefinite delay in the lawsuit until Romanian proceedings conclude.The Tates' legal team argued against any delay, stating that the Romanian case is expected to take years to resolve. No immediate ruling was issued.Additionally, the brothers filed a court motion expressing fear of ""imminent harm"" from Jane Doe, requesting a temporary restraining order that would prevent her from coming within 500 feet of them. They also sought legal protection barring her from contacting, threatening, stalking, harming, or harassing them.The Tates have asked for an emergency hearing on the restraining order, urging the judge to set a court date as soon as possible.","The Tate brothers and two Romanian women were arrested in late 2022 in Bucharest.

Clock running out for refugees in Islamabad, Rawalpindi



'We've worked with the Americans for years'



Kabul, Islamabad row amid rising crackdown



Forced to move after decades in Pakistan



UN says Pakistan has a tradition of protecting Afghans

A woman who we will call Fatima fled Afghanistan with her family in December 2021. She had worked for an American non-profit organization in Kabul ­until the US pullout in the summer of 2021, when the Taliban retook control of the country.She is now based in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad. And she is in trouble. Her Pakistani visa is days away from expiring, and the authorities are still processing her renewal application.""I am concerned about the renewal of my visa, and if not renewed timely authorities would arrest me and my family for illegally residing in the country,"" Fatima told DW.Police, including female officers, recently conducted a raid on a building where Fatima lives, looking for undocumented Afghan refugees. She was not in the building at the time, but her brother ended up in custody.""Later, we showed them our visa renewal application receipts and proof but police did not cooperate,"" said Fatima, who is now hiding from the authorities.In 2023, Pakistan started a massive initiative to repatriate approximately 4 million Afghans who have entered the country over the past 40 years. And while the authorities granted some leeway last year, Pakistan's government has now set a March 31 deadline to expel foreign nationals residing in the country illegally, with search operations ongoing in January and February.Afghan refugees living in Islamabad and the nearby city of Rawalpindi ""have been verbally asked to leave Pakistan till 28th February,"" Umer Gillani, a legal expert and rights activist, told DW.Moniza Kakar, a lawyer working for refugees advocacy in Pakistan, said there was ""uncertainty and fear"" among the Afghani nationals in the area.""Since the start of this year, over 1,000 Afghans have been detained in Islamabad, and more than 18,000 have been forced to leave Islamabad and Rawalpindi because of government orders,"" she said.Amin, 28, is from Kabul. He spent years collaborating with the United States in the fight against the Taliban in Afghanistan, before he too had to flee across the Pakistani border.Hee said he was just days away from being evacuated to America, but this was put on hold last month with President Donald Trump signing an executive order to suspend a refugee resettlement program.Nearly 20,000 Afghans are presently waiting in Pakistan for approval to resettle in the US through an American government program.""We've worked with the Americans for years, we helped and supported them in Afghanistan, we have given them a part of our lives and they have to support us so that we can live peacefully,"" Amin told DW.Over the last three years, Pakistan's relationship with neighboring Afghanistan has deteriorated. Islamabad holds the Taliban authorities in Afghanistan responsible for their inability to control the operations of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group that formed in 2007 and has conducted numerous attacks on Pakistani security forces.As cross-border tensions with the Taliban regime escalate, concerns were also raised about the well-being of Afghans in Pakistan amid reports of purported intimidation and arrests. The UN special rapporteur has expressed his worries, stating that Afghans in the area deserve more humane treatment.Activist Gilani said millions of Afghan refugees in Pakistan are being used as ""hostages to build pressure whenever there is tension between the two countries.""Last week, Pakistan's Foreign Ministry dismissed claims made by the Afghan representation regarding the mistreatment of Afghan refugees in Pakistan, labeling these allegations as ""misplaced"" and urging Kabul to facilitate the smooth repatriation of Afghan citizens.Pakistan has accommodated hundreds of thousands of refugees from its northern neighbor, a situation resulting from decades of regional instability. Afghans who arrived in Pakistan following the Taliban takeover in August 2021 have been relying on visa renewals to stay in the country, a procedure that is costly, uncertain and often subject to significant delays.""The stories of refugees are devastating. Families who have lived in Pakistan for years, even decades, are now being uprooted due to tensions between the two countries. Children, women, and men who have already suffered so much are being treated as if they don't matter. This is not just a refugee crisis, it's a humanitarian crisis,"" said Kakar.UNHCR's top representative in Pakistan, Philippa Candler, told DW that Pakistan already repatriated over 800,000 Afghan refugees between September 2023 and the end of last year.""As of December 2024, Pakistan hosted over 2.8 million Afghans with 69% of refugees living outside refugee villages,"" she said.Candler acknowledged Pakistan's generosity in hosting Afghan refugees for decades, and the current ""economic and security challenges"" in Pakistan that drive the repatriation efforts.At the same time, UNHCR was urging the Islamabad government to ""see the situation of Afghans through a humanitarian perspective"" and ""continue its long-standing tradition of protecting vulnerable Afghans […] regardless of their status.""""It's essential that we work hand-in-hand with both host countries and countries of origin to develop mechanisms that empower refugees to rebuild their lives in safety and dignity, including voluntary repatriation,"" she said.""We are calling for dialogue between the two countries, and for the refugee issue to be separated from political matters.""","Afghan refugees living in Islamabad and the nearby city of Rawalpindi are in trouble. Pakistan's government has now set a March 31 deadline to expel foreign nationals residing in the country illegally. Nearly 20,000 Afghans are waiting in Pakistan for approval to resettle in the US through an American government program.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118572997,imgsize-927785,width-400,resizemode-4/118572997.jpg"

New York City is terminating a $220m deal with the Pakistan-owned Roosevelt Hotel to house a migrant shelter following a prolonged MAGA meltdown over use of American taxpayer money to facilitate immigration to the US.Under pressure from the federal government and MAGA hardliners, Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat who gravitated to the Trump orbit after facing corruption charges from the Biden administration, announced closure of the site that is said to have housed tens of thousands of migrants in its 1025 rooms at $ 200 a night.The site opened in May 2023 to serve as both a new arrivals center and shelter for asylum seekers under a three-year $ 220 million deal with government-run Pakistan International Airlines, which owns the hotel, having bought out a Saudi stake in it for $ 36.4million in 2005.At peak traffic in 2023 when around 4000 migrants were arriving in the city each week, the sight of asylum seekers camping outside the hotel waiting to be processed triggered MAGA hardliners and even some New Yorkers, as Trump and his supporters complained about Democrats housing ""illegal immigrants"" in ""luxury hotels"" at the expense of US taxpayers.""A taxpayer-funded hotel for illegal migrants is owned by the Pakistani government, which means NYC taxpayers are effectively paying a foreign government to house illegals in our own country.

"No passengers, no planes: China-funded $240m Gwadar airport sits idle",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/no-passengers-no-planes-china-funded-240m-gwadar-airport-sits-idle/articleshow/118512631.cms,"Gwadar airport in Pakistan (Pic credit: AP)

With no passengers and no planes, Pakistan's newest and most expensive airport is a bit of a mystery. Entirely financed by China to the tune of $240 million, it's anyone's guess when New Gwadar International Airport will open for business. Located in the coastal city of Gwadar and completed in Oct 2024, its a stark contrast to the impoverished, restive southwestern Balochistan province around it.For the past decade, China has poured money into Balochistan and Gwadar as part of a multibillion dollar project that connects its western Xinjiang province with Arabian Sea, called the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor or CPEC.Authorities have hailed it as transformational but there's scant evidence of change in Gwadar. The city isn't connected to the national grid - electricity comes from Iran or solar panels - and there isn't enough clean water. An airport with a 400,000 passenger capacity isn't a priority for the city's 90,000 people.""This airport is not for Pakistan or Gwadar,"" said Azeem Khalid, an international relations expert who specialises in Pakistan-China ties. ""It is for China, so they can have secure access for their citizens to Gwadar and Balochistan.""CPEC has catalysed a decadeslong insurgency in resource-rich and strategically located Balochistan. Separatists, aggrieved by what they say is state exploitation at the expense of locals, are fighting for independence - targeting Pakistani troops and Chinese workers in the province and elsewhere. Members of Pakistan's ethnic Baloch minority say they face discrimination by govt and are denied opportunities available elsewhere in the country, charges govt denies.Pakistan, keen to protect China's investments, has stepped up its military footprint in Gwadar to combat dissent. The city is a jumble of checkpoints, barbed wire, troops, barricades, and watchtowers. Roads close at any given time, several days a week, to permit the safe passage of Chinese workers and Pakistani VIPs.Intelligence officers monitor journalists visiting Gwadar. Its fish market is deemed too sensitive for coverage.Many locals are frazzled. ""Nobody used to ask where we are going, what we are doing, and what is your name,"" said Khuda Bakhsh Hashim, 76. ""We used to enjoy all-night picnics in the mountains or rural areas. We are residents. Those who ask should identify themselves as to who they are.""Hashim recalled when Gwadar was part of Oman, not Pakistan, and was a stop for passenger ships heading to Mumbai. People didn't go hungry and found work easily, he said.But Gwadar's water has dried up because of drought and unchecked exploitation. So has the work. Govt says CPEC has created some 2,000 local jobs but it's not clear whom they mean by ""local"" - Baloch residents or Pakistanis from elsewhere in the country. Authorities did not elaborate.There is a perception Gwadar is dangerous or difficult to visit - only one commercial route operates out of its domestic airport, three times a week to Karachi, Pakistan's largest city. There are no direct flights to Balochistan's provincial capital of Quetta, or national capital of Islamabad.Security concerns delayed the inauguration of the international airport. There were fears the area's mountains - and their proximity to the airport - could be the ideal launchpad for an attack. Instead, PM Shehbaz Sharif and his Chinese counterpart Li Qiang hosted a virtual ceremony. The inaugural flight was off limits to media and public.","Gwadar is Pakistan's newest and most expensive airport. Entirely financed by China to the tune of $240 million.

ISLAMABAD: A mob enraged by a local’s murder over a trivial parking dispute snatched the suspect, a watchman, from police and lynched him in the mountainous Galiyat region of Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Sunday. Several police officers were wounded in the violence in a neighbourhood under the jurisdiction of Changla Gali police station, around 80km from Islamabad.Police said Imran Abbasi, a local, had parked his car in the designated area of a housing society and left for home. When he returned the next day, he got into a fight with the watchman, Khan Zaman, who allegedly stabbed him to death and wounded his brother.As word spread about the murder, a mob milled in the area and burned down five houses in the residential society.Police apprehended the culprit, who was hiding in the basement of a building, and were about to take him away when the mob swooped on him and beat him to death with sticks and stones.Lynchings are common in Pakistan and several instances of mob violence have taken place in the past decade. Many people have been lynched for alleged blasphemy, while mobs have also murdered suspects in street crimes.In June 2024, a suspected robber was lynched by a mob in the southern port city of Karachi. The suspect, armed with a pistol, had attempted to rob a citizen, who put up resistance and was joined by others standing nearby. The mob got hold of the suspect and hit him with blunt weapons, resulting in his death on the spot.In May 2024, another mob lynched a suspected robber in Karachi's Orangi town while police saved his accomplice from being killed.The same month, police rescued a Christian man from angry people, who wanted to lynch him and attacked the homes of other minority members in Punjab’s Sargodha district on charges of alleged blasphemy. Workers at a Sialkot garment factory tortured and burned to death their Sri Lankan general manager in 2023 for alleged blasphemy.","Imran Abbasi, a local, had parked his car in the designated area of a housing society and left for home.

Militancy in Balochistan



Airport inauguration delayed due to security concerns



Pakistan’s newest airport in Gwadar, fully funded by China at a cost of $240 million, remains unused months after its completion in October 2024.Spread over 4,300 acres of land. the airport is Pakistan's largest international airport and was officially opened on January 20 this year. Work started on Gwadar airport in 2019.The Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) PK 503 aircraft was the first commercial flight to arrive at the new airport after its inauguration carrying commercial passengers and high-ranking officials.However, the airport, designed to handle 400,000 passengers annually, has no scheduled flights.The New Gwadar International Airport is part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ), a multi-billion dollar project aimed at linking China’s Xinjiang province with the Arabian Sea. While officials have called it a major development, many in Gwadar say they see little benefit.Gwadar, located in Pakistan's Balochistan province , lacks basic infrastructure such as a stable electricity supply and clean water.""This airport is not for Pakistan or Gwadar,"" Azeem Khalid, an expert in Pakistan-China relations was quoted as saying by the news agency Associated Press (AP). ""It is for China, so they can have secure access for their citizens to Gwadar and Balochistan.""The airport’s construction comes amid ongoing security challenges in Balochistan. Separatist groups in the province oppose what they call exploitation of local resources, targeting both Pakistani security forces and Chinese workers.Pakistan has increased its military presence in Gwadar to protect Chinese investments, leading to more checkpoints and restrictions on movement. Roads are often closed to ensure the safety of Chinese workers and high-ranking officials.""Nobody used to ask where we are going, what we are doing, and what is your name,"" 76-year-old Gwadar resident Khuda Bakhsh Hashim was quoted as saying by the AP. ""We are asked to prove our identity, who we are, where we have come from. We are residents. Those who ask should identify themselves as to who they are.""Authorities claim CPEC has created 2,000 jobs, but there is no clarity on whether these positions were given to local Baloch residents or people from other parts of Pakistan.Gwadar remains largely disconnected, with only one commercial flight route operating three times a week to Karachi. There are no direct flights to Quetta, the provincial capital, or Islamabad.Militancy in Balochistan has increased in recent years, with attacks rising after 2021. Groups such as the Baloch Liberation Army have carried out multiple attacks, particularly after the Pakistani Taliban ended a ceasefire in 2022.Earlier, the airport’s opening was postponed due to security risks. Authorities feared that nearby mountains could be used to launch attacks. Instead, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chinese Premier Li Qiang held a virtual inauguration. The first flight landed without media or public presence.Abdul Ghafoor Hoth, a local leader from the Balochistan Awami Party, said no local residents were hired to work at the airport.""Not a single resident of Gwadar was hired to work at the airport, not even as a watchman,"" he was quoted by AP.Hoth had led protests in December demanding better living conditions in Gwadar. The demonstrations lasted 47 days before authorities promised to address local concerns, including improved access to water and electricity. Since then, no progress has been made on these commitments.","Gwadar airport is Pakistan's largest international airport and was officially opened on January 20 this year.

At least seven passengers belonging to Pakistan’s Punjab province were shot dead late on Tuesday night in Barkhan district, in volatile southwestern Balochistan province.The incident occurred on a Balochistan-Punjab highway running through the Koh-e-Sulaiman mountain range.

In Afghanistan, the brutal tradition of Bacha Bazi—the sexual exploitation of young boys—continues to thrive despite official bans and international condemnation. Footage, shared by British journalist and writer David Patrikarakos on social media, showed boys forced to dance for the Taliban, a harrowing precursor to systematic abuse. This centuries-old practice, deeply ingrained in Afghan society, has long been linked to military commanders, politicians, and local elites.Strangely, the supreme Taliban leaders are against the Bacha Bazi practice but it is still being secretly practised by the military commanders, showing the loopholes in their rules framing, Daily Mail reported.After the Taliban took control of Afghanistan on August 15, 2021, they tried to curb this practice but made no efforts to actually stop it as secretly but still the military commanders followed it.Even recently the US state department report has highlighted the systematic recruitment of boys for sexual slavery, with Afghan security forces among the perpetrators.The horror of boy slaves is not confined to Afghanistan. In neighboring Pakistan, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province near the Afghan border, young boys searching for work often fall prey to similar abuse. Many are lured by promises of employment but are instead trafficked and exploited by powerful men, including truck drivers and local elites. According to reports, these boys, often from impoverished families, become trapped in cycles of abuse with little hope of escape. The cultural silence surrounding their suffering mirrors the impunity with which Bacha Bazi operates in Afghanistan.The trauma suffered by victims extends beyond abuse. Many turn to drugs to cope, while others are cast out once they age out of exploitation. Survivors have recounted severe physical injuries and psychological scars, with few avenues for justice in a society where the perpetrators are often the most powerful.The West, despite its decades-long involvement in Afghanistan, failed to dismantle this horrific practice. During the US occupation, American soldiers reported hearing Afghan police officers sexually abusing boys on military bases, yet were ordered to turn a blind eye, as it was considered ""their culture.""With Afghanistan now under Taliban rule, Bacha Bazi remains rampant, exacerbated by extreme gender segregation and the increasing oppression of women. Supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada, an ultra-conservative figure with little regard for human rights, has enforced strict moral laws while failing to eradicate this abuse. His extremist policies have led to deep divisions within the Taliban’s leadership, yet his grip on power remains firm—an assertion also reported by Daily Mail.The West may have withdrawn from Afghanistan, but its failure to protect the country’s most vulnerable lingers. The abandoned victims of Bacha Bazi —boys robbed of their childhood and dignity—serve as a grim testament to a conflict that ended, but left behind an enduring legacy of suffering, not just in Afghanistan but also in Pakistan, where similar atrocities continue in the shadows.","Bacha Bazi is a centuries-old tradition of sexual exploitation of young boys in Afghanistan.

acha bazi

In Afghanistan, a disturbing practice known as ""b"" continues to plague society as young boys, often pre-pubescent, are forced to dance for affluent Afghan men who subsequently sexually abuse them.These children, sometimes sold by impoverished families, are made to wear make-up and perform at gatherings.The practice, dating back to the 13th century, has persisted despite various regime changes. While the Taliban initially banned it during their first rule in the 1990s, the practice flourished again after the 2001 US invasion.Following America's withdrawal in 2021, it has become endemic, particularly in Pashtun tribal areas where estimates suggest half the men participate.""I love my lord. I love to dance and act like a woman and play with my owner. Once I grow up, I will be an owner and I will have my own boys,"" Ahmad, then 17, told to news agency Reuters in 2007, demonstrating how victims are groomed to accept their exploitation.The consequences for victims are severe. Beyond psychological trauma, they suffer serious physical injuries including internal bleeding, broken limbs, and sometimes death. When they mature, these boys often become social outcasts, turning to drugs or becoming exploiters themselves.The practice persists despite homosexuality being punishable by death in Afghanistan.According to Daily Mail, in 2024, the EU Agency for Asylum claimed: ""Afghan security forces, in particular the Afghan Local Police, reportedly recruited boys specifically to use them for bacha bazi in every province of the country.’The contradiction exists because many Afghans consider it culturally acceptable, particularly in conservative religious groups. According to a 2009 Human Terrain Team study, some Pashtun social norms don't view bacha bazi as un-Islamic or homosexual.Western forces encountered this reality during their deployment. Lance Corporal Gregory Buckley Jr's father revealed his son's distressing experience: ""At night we can hear them screaming, but we're not allowed to do anything about it,"" the marine told his father, being instructed to ignore it as ""their culture.""The Taliban has exploited this situation, using child prostitutes to infiltrate military bases and attack Afghan forces working with Americans. In 2016, numerous soldiers and policemen were killed through such honeytrap operations.Despite Afghanistan introducing laws in 2018 to punish those involved in Bacha bazi, the practice continues unabated under current Taliban rule. The situation is exacerbated by strict gender segregation and women's rights restrictions under Supreme Leader Hibatullah Akhundzada's leadership.The international community's departure has left these vulnerable boys without protection, perpetuating a cycle of abuse that remains deeply embedded in certain aspects of Afghan society.This represents a tragic failure of international intervention, leaving countless children exposed to ongoing exploitation and abuse.","Bacha bazi is a practice in which pre-pubescent boys are forced to dance for affluent Afghan men who sexually abuse them.

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer , on behalf of King Charles, formally invited President Donald Trump for a state visit to Britain. The invitation, extended at the start of their White House meeting on Thursday, was swiftly accepted by Trump.Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, the Bristish PM touched Trump’s shoulder as he extended a historic invitation for a second state visit, stating that: ""This is really special. This has never happened before. This is unprecedented.""Recalling Trump’s 2019 state visit, Starmer hailed it as a “tremendous success” and emphasized that the offer for a second visit was “truly historic.”After reading the letter, Trump asserted: “It would be an honor,” calling the United Kingdom a “fantastic” country.The high-profile meeting comes as Starmer makes a strategic push in Washington, urging Trump to recognize that a lasting peace in Ukraine can only be achieved if Kyiv and European leaders are directly involved in negotiations with Moscow.Following French President Emmanuel Macron's recent visit, Starmer's arrival underscores European apprehension regarding Trump's enthusiastic pursuit of ending Russia's Ukrainian conflict, suggesting possible excessive concessions to Russian President Vladimir Putin.Trump stated on Wednesday during his first Cabinet meeting of his second term, ""We're going to do the best we can to make the best deal we can for both sides. For Ukraine, we're going to try very hard to make a good deal so that they can get as much (land) back as possible.""Trump's renewed relationship with Russia has created unease amongst America's traditional European allies. These nations find themselves challenged by Trump's White House return and his commitment to restructure US foreign policy according to his ""America First"" perspective.Recent developments include the Trump administration's discussions with Russia, excluding Ukrainian and European allies. Additionally, the US declined to support UN resolutions attributing responsibility to Russia for the three-year-old conflict. Trump's evolving stance on Ukraine is causing significant changes in transatlantic relationships.The administration contests suggestions that Trump is disregarding Europe or showing excessive eagerness for settlement discussions with Putin.Vice President JD Vance defended the president's approach, stating, ""He hasn't conceded anything to anyone.”""He's doing the job of a diplomat,” he added.Trump’s meeting with Starmer takes place just a day ahead of his scheduled White House talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The two leaders are set to finalise a highly debated agreement granting the US access to Ukraine’s critical minerals—key resources for the aerospace, defense, and nuclear industries on Friday. Zelenskyy had previously resisted signing the deal without concrete security assurances from Washington.","UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer formally invited President Donald Trump for a state visit to Britain.
