Omar’s party goes unrepresented as party MP opts out of outreach trip,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/omars-party-goes-unrepresented-as-party-mp-opts-out-of-outreach-trip/articleshow/121400097.cms,"SRINAGAR: J&K’s National Conference (NC) has no plans to nominate another representative for the all-party delegations briefing foreign nations and UN members about India’s anti-terrorism position and Operation Sindoor after party MP Mian Altaf Ahmad declined to join the team currently visiting key countries. NC will not have political representation in any of the seven delegations.Centre had nominated the Anantnag–Rajouri MP for the delegation led by DMK MP Kanimozhi in his capacity as NC’s parliamentary head, party sources said Sunday. The team includes Rajiv Rai (SP), Capt Brijesh Chowta (BJP), Prem Chand Gupta (RJD), and ambassador Jawed Ashraf. It was in Russia Saturday.Three politicians from J&K — Ghulam Nabi Azad (Democratic Progressive Azad Party), Mian Altaf (NC), and Ghulam Ali Khatana (BJP) — had been named for these outreach efforts.Altaf opted out as he is engaged with the annual religious ceremony of Hazrat Mian Nizamuddin Kiyanvi, popularly known as Baba Nagri, held in early June at Wangath in Kangan of Ganderbal district. The event draws thousands of devotees across J&K.A senior NC functionary said while the party was consulted and Altaf’s consent was sought, the nomination was Centre’s decision. “Centre didn’t ask us for his replacement after he declined,” the functionary said.“Since he was nominated as parliamentary head, I don’t think anyone else can represent NC now.”Tensions within NC also surfaced Sunday, as MP Aga Ruhullah Mehdi accused party brass of yielding to Centre on Article 370 . On X, Mehdi wrote: “Oh leader! Either rise and speak up for your people, or step down, wear bangles, and remain confined to a palanquin.”The post appeared to target CM Omar Abdullah , who had earlier posted: “Sunday musing. There are doers & there are talkers. That’s why I don’t talk as much as some people I know.”The internal rift became public during NC’s working committee meeting on May 21, where Mehdi voiced frustration over lack of progress on restoring Article 370.",NC will not have political representation in any of the seven delegations. Centre had nominated the Anantnag–Rajouri MP for the delegation led by DMK MP Kanimozhi.

Two accused in 2003 Kolkata gang-rape case acquitted 20 years later,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/two-accused-in-2003-kolkata-gang-rape-case-acquitted-20-years-later/articleshow/121399014.cms,"KOLKATA: A gang-rape case, reported in Amherst Street in the city in May 2003, that came up for trial 20 years later -- in Jan 2025 - has led to the acquittal of two persons implicated by police. The complainant, who appeared before a Kolkata trial judge on April 24, said that two decades later, she was unable to recollect ""what happened"" that day and who tortured her.The trial court, in its May 23 order, while acquitting the two accused, also criticised the police for shoddy investigation where none of the witnesses or evidence produced helped unravel the crime.Additional district and sessions Judge Rohan Sinha, in his judgment, said, ""Not a single witness examined by the prosecution could throw any light on the incident alleged. Unfortunately, even the victim has turned turtle from her earlier statement.""The judge also pointed out three key lapses by the investigating officer (IO) which led to the acquittal. The judge said, ""The victim could not identify the wrongdoers, but, curiously, the IO did not try to get the accused persons to face any Test Identification Parade for their identification.""The judge also noted that despite the survivor having given an in-camera testimony to a judicial magistrate, her statement under 164 CrPC was not produced in court.Also, the Amherst Street officer-in-charge did not bother to ""sign or endorse"" the survivor's statement saying that she was gang-raped, which led to the FIR.The trial court also could not rely solely on the survivor's testimony because she filed a formal application not to proceed with the same.The judge, in his order, recorded that the survivor ""firmly deposed that due to the passage of time of more than 20 years, she could not recollect exactly what happened to her on the fateful day. She also failed to disclose the identity of the accused, nor could she identify the accused persons"".According to the case details, the survivor was engaged as a casual labourer to work in an under-construction house in Rajarhat by one of the accused. According to the FIR, which was also corroborated in the police charge sheet filed in 2004, on May 13, 2003, she was working when she was gang-raped by two persons, including the one who engaged her for work. Police, 20 years ago, got the victim medically examined, recorded her statement before a magistrate, and charge-sheeted four persons. Two among those named in the charge sheet were arrested, while the remaining two are still absconding.","A gang-rape case, reported in Kolkata in May 2003, came up for trial 20 years later.

"Tej Pratap: Rebel without cause, felled by poll cause",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tej-pratap-rebel-without-cause-felled-by-poll-cause/articleshow/121398999.cms,"PATNA: In Bihar's complex political theatre, few figures are as erratic, unpredictable and, at times, bewildering as Tej Pratap Yadav , elder son of RJD chief Lalu Prasad . Once introduced as a rising heir to his father's legacy, Tej Pratap has evolved into a political liability, a family outcast, and, most curiously, a man whose personal whims have routinely overshadowed the party's agenda.This election year in Bihar, Tej Pratap has become the proverbial thorn in Lalu's side, a distraction the veteran socialist could no longer ignore. On Saturday, Tej Pratap again seized headlines, not for strategy or statesmanship, but for posting on social media about a new ""relation"" with a woman. The announcement was casual, dramatic and ambiguous, a pattern now familiar to those who have followed his journey over the past decade.While dynastic politics in the country often comes with high expectations, Tej Pratap never seemed to settle into the role. His early appearances as state health minister in 2015 - more notable for clumsy media interactions than policy achievements - left many wondering whether he was suited for public life at all. Reports of him consulting astrologers for state matters and allegedly bringing a cow into his ministerial bungalow for ""positive energy"" became tabloid fodder and marked the beginning of a reputation built more on eccentricity than governance.Tej Pratap's dramatic personal life has also been central to his public persona. His 2018 marriage to Aishwarya Rai, granddaughter of former CM Daroga Rai, was supposed to cement a powerful political alliance. Instead, it turned into a scandal. Within months, he filed for divorce, alleging domestic discord, while Aishwarya accused him of abuse and erratic behaviour.Family tensions spilled into public view as Lalu and Rabri Devi struggled to contain the fallout. In one infamous episode, Tej Pratap declared he was going on a pilgrimage to escape ""toxic atmosphere"" of home. His tantrums did not stop there. He often skipped key party events, launched public tirades against younger brother Tejashwi Prasad Yadav , now firmly established as Lalu's political heir, and floated vague threats of forming his own political outfit.Saturday's post, just months before assembly elections, appears to be another in a long line of personal dramas staged in public view.In a rare but decisive step, Lalu Prasad finally acted. Tej Pratap was formally expelled from RJD and disowned by family. The message was clear - political survival trumps paternal indulgence.","Tej Pratap Yadav has evolved into a political liability, a family outcast, and a man whose personal whims have routinely overshadowed the party's agenda.

"Brett Favre claims Netflix is smearing him over Donald Trump support, not scandals",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/brett-favre-claims-netflix-is-smearing-him-over-donald-trump-support-not-scandals/articleshow/121393942.cms,"Brett Favre implies he's being targeted by Netflix (Image via AP)

Brett Favre implies he's being targeted because of his conservative politics

Documentary revisits scandals that reshaped Favre's post-NFL image

Critics question his legacy, but Favre doubles down

NFL Hall of Famer Brett Favre is once again at the center of controversy—not for his past on-field glory, but for how he believes he’s being portrayed in the new Netflix documentary Untold: The Fall of Favre. The former Green Bay Packers quarterback has implied that the documentary’s critical tone is less about justice and more about politics, suggesting he's being singled out for his outspoken support of Donald Trump.While Favre hasn’t issued a direct statement about the documentary, his actions on social media are telling. He recently reposted two messages on X (formerly Twitter) that accuse Netflix of political bias, insinuating that the streaming giant is punishing him for backing Trump. Though Favre didn’t write the tweets himself, his amplification of them speaks volumes and aligns with a narrative that he is a victim of political targeting.The Fall of Favre explores two major controversies linked to the legendary quarterback: his alleged involvement in the $77 million Mississippi welfare fraud scandal, and sexual harassment claims from his brief tenure with the New York Jets. The documentary paints a sharp contrast between the public's image of Favre as the “everyman” quarterback and the less flattering reality of his legal and ethical troubles.One particularly damning detail is the $5 million that allegedly went toward constructing a volleyball stadium at the University of Southern Mississippi—Favre’s alma mater and the school where his daughter played. Text messages released in 2022 show Favre asking if the funding could be kept under wraps, fueling public suspicion. Though he hasn't been criminally charged, he remains involved in ongoing civil litigation.The documentary also revisits the sexting allegations brought by former sideline reporter Jenn Sterger, who accused Favre of sending unsolicited explicit content. The NFL fined him $50,000 for not cooperating with their investigation, though no formal action was taken on the allegations themselves.As The Fall of Favre garners attention, so does the political undertone of its reception. “Never meet your heroes,” one interviewee quips, capturing the disillusionment felt by many.Also Read: Tom Cruise leaves Pat McAfee stunned after comparing death-defying stunts to NFL quarterbacks' pressure and precision Favre, however, sees this as more than a reputation crisis—he sees it as political persecution. As the legal drama unfolds and the public reevaluates one of the NFL’s most iconic figures, the question remains: is this accountability, or a politically charged takedown?","Brett Favre implies he's being targeted because of his conservative politics.

‘They lost Annabelle?’ Internet meltdown over haunted doll,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/they-lost-annabelle-internet-meltdown-over-haunted-doll-heres-what-really-happened/articleshow/121392274.cms,"Annabelle doll (Screengrab from FB video posted by Ryan D. Buell.)

The haunted doll that terrifies millions

From horror icon to internet meme





The infamous Annabelle doll, known as one of the most feared haunted objects in the world, became the center of an internet firestorm in the past few days after social media users claimed it had mysteriously vanished during a paranormal tour in the US. The doll, currently touring the country as part of the “Devils on the Run” exhibit, reportedly wasn’t visible to visitors at a recent stop, sparking fears, conspiracy theories, and viral panic online.The speculation intensified after a fire broke out at the historic Nottoway Resort in White Castle, Louisiana- just days after Annabelle had been displayed in the state. While officials confirmed that no injuries occurred and dismissed any supernatural link to the blaze, social media users quickly pointed to the doll’s presence as a chilling coincidence.“So the streets are saying after they moved the Annabelle doll out of the Warren museum (when they explicitly said never to move it) she's now gone missing.” one user posted on X (formerly Twitter), echoing the sentiments of thousands who feared the worst. Another exclaimed, “WHAT THE HELL DO YOU MEAN THEY LOST THE ANNABELLE DOLL??? ONE OF THE MOST HAUNTED POSSESSIONS?? THAT ANNABELLE?""Despite the viral meltdown, the panic was short-lived.Dan Rivera of the New England Society for Psychic Research (NESPR), which oversees the Warren Occult Museum’s collection, released a video showing the doll safe and sound in its protective glass case back in Connecticut.“Some wild and crazy internet rumours this morning claiming that we lost Annabelle. She/it is NOT lost,” read the caption alongside the video, posted by Ryan D. Buell.The Annabelle doll’s legend dates back to the 1970s, when it was reportedly given as a gift to a nurse in Hartford, Connecticut. What appeared to be a harmless Raggedy Ann doll soon exhibited disturbing behavior- moving on its own, leaving handwritten notes, and allegedly attacking one of the occupants.The case caught the attention of famed paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, who concluded that the doll wasn’t possessed by a child’s spirit, but manipulated by a demonic entity. The Warrens took the doll into their care and placed it inside a sealed glass case in their Occult Museum, where it has remained under lock and key- until recently.Though the museum in Monroe, Connecticut, remains closed to the public, Annabelle is currently on a national tour, part of the “Devils on the Run” exhibit. The event showcases haunted artifacts from the Warrens' collection and has drawn massive interest across the country. In May, the doll made headlines after appearing at the former Moundsville State Penitentiary in West Virginia- a notoriously haunted site. A video of the doll being moved into the penitentiary racked up over 9 million views on TikTok, reigniting public fascination with the paranormal.Annabelle’s legend exploded into the mainstream with the 2014 release of Annabelle, the horror film that spun off from The Conjuring franchise. The series has since grossed more than $800 million globally, turning the doll into a pop culture icon—and a consistent source of real-world fear.Following its West Virginia appearance, Annabelle’s tour has included stops in New Orleans and is scheduled to continue in San Antonio, Texas, and other cities, including locations in Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky.In the meantime, whether the doll ever left the museum or whether the sightings were part of a promotional stunt remains unclear. What is certain, however, is that Annabelle continues to captivate and terrify the public imagination.(This is a top Google Trends topic)","The Annabelle doll is currently touring the country as part of the “Devils on the Run’ exhibit.

BENGALURU: As schools prepare to reopen, Karnataka Associated Managements of Schools (KAMS) has issued a fresh advisory urging all private educational institutions to stay vigilant in light of alerts over emerging Covid-19 variants and other viral infections. An updated SOP by the association of private schools followed a death due to Covid-19 in the city Saturday.The circular emphasises that while there is no reason to panic, schools must act with responsibility and reinforce hygiene and safety protocols. The advisory outlines a series of updated measures to be implemented before and during school reopening to ensure the safety of students, staff and their families. A key directive is the enforcement of a health-based attendance policy. Students showing symptoms of fever, cough, cold, rashes or allergies should not be sent to school, and parents are advised to seek medical attention immediately. ""The health of all children is a priority over attendance records,"" the advisory stated.Schools are also instructed to conduct thorough sanitisation and promote awareness on hygiene. Teachers and staff are urged to educate children about hand washing, respiratory etiquette, and the importance of clean, ventilated classrooms.In case a child falls sick during school hours, schools must isolate the student in a supervised space and inform the parents without delay. The advisory further reminds stakeholders to avoid spreading panic or unverified news about Covid-19, urging reliance on official updates from health authorities.KAMS general secretary Shashi Kumar D told TOI, ""We haven't got any guidelines from the govt so far. These are guidelines we from the association have shared with all our schools as a social responsibility to take precautionary measures. Considering the rain and how kids can be vulnerable to infections, we don't want schools and parents to panic.""""As of now, these are very general measures and other measures like social distancing and masks are not really needed…in such cases, schools will be informed later on the same,"" he said in a video.","An updated SOP by the association of private schools followed a death due to Covid-19 in the city Saturday.

Patna: If the number of applications received for admission to the undergraduate courses is any indication, the Patna University (PU) colleges have very little charm for the boys and girls passing class XII examination from different boards.The premier colleges of the state, attached to the seventh oldest university of this subcontinent, no longer attract the scholars for higher studies. Figures available with the official sources reveal that the university, which used to attract a large number of admission seekers from across the state and also from some neighbouring states until a decade ago, are finding it difficult to fill up even their sanctioned seats.PU sources told this newspaper that in 2019, the university received as many as 48,000 applications for admission to its UG courses. The numbers declined to 30,000 in 2020. In the following years—2021 and 2022—the numbers further declined to a little more than 21,000. But, the number of applications received for UG admissions further slumped to only about 10,000 in 2023 and 12,000 in 2024.Welfare dean of students, Anil Kumar, said that a centralised entrance test for admission to all the undergraduate courses in PU colleges was introduced in 2012 at the instance of then vice-chancellor Shambhu Nath Singh.But this practice was dropped after the implementation of National Education Policy, 2020 in the university and it started admitting students on marks secured in class XII examination, he said.In the current session (2025-26), PU received only about 8,000 applications till the last date of the receipt of online applications (May 23) for admission to the four-year degree programme in arts, science and commerce streams under conventional courses and three-year degree programme in vocational courses. The university had invited online applications for admission to both the conventional and vocational academic programmes running in Patna College, Patna Science College, B N College, Vanijya Mahavidyalay, and Magadh Mahila College.Considering the poor response of boys and girls for admission in PU colleges and also due to somewhat delayed publication of CBSE class XII results, the university authorities have extended the last date of online submission of applications till May 31. But, it is unlikely to make much difference to the students' growing indifference to the higher education institutions under PU, said a retired teacher.Last year, more than 1,000 out of the total of 4,500 sanctioned seats in UG classes remained vacant as students were least interested in studying in these institutions. Recurring violence leading to the death of students on the campus have only been serving as a deterrent for the admission seekers. ""How can I send my ward to study in PU where students are being murdered in daylight and the hostels are allowed to be occupied by anti-social elements,"" quipped a guardian.Patna: If the number of applications received for admission to the undergraduate courses is any indication, the Patna University (PU) colleges have very little charm for the boys and girls passing class XII examination from different boards.The premier colleges of the state, attached to the seventh oldest university of this subcontinent, no longer attract the scholars for higher studies.

The university had invited online applications for admission to both the conventional and vocational academic programmes running in Patna College, Patna Science College, B N College, Vanijya Mahavidyalay, and Magadh Mahila College.Considering the poor response of boys and girls for admission in PU colleges and also due to somewhat delayed publication of CBSE class XII results, the university authorities have extended the last date of online submission of applications till May 31. But, it is unlikely to make much difference to the students' growing indifference to the higher education institutions under PU, said a retired teacher.Last year, more than 1,000 out of the total of 4,500 sanctioned seats in UG classes remained vacant as students were least interested in studying in these institutions. Recurring violence leading to the death of students on the campus have only been serving as a deterrent for the admission seekers. ""How can I send my ward to study in PU where students are being murdered in daylight and the hostels are allowed to be occupied by anti-social elements,"" quipped a guardian.","The premier colleges of the state, attached to the seventh oldest university of this subcontinent, no longer attract the scholars for higher studies. Figures available with the official sources reveal that the university, which used to attract a large number of admission seekers from across the state and also from some neighbouring states until a decade ago, are finding it difficult to fill up even their sanctioned seats.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121393442,imgsize-50508,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/121393442.jpg"

INDORE: In a rerun of the Nirbhaya horror, a tribal woman was gangraped and tortured so brutally that she died on Saturday afternoon. Savaged with a wooden object or a rod, her intestines were protruding when she was found bleeding, unconscious, and taking her last breaths in a village in Khandwa on Saturday afternoon.Two men, who were the last to be seen with her, have been arrested, said DIG Siddharth Bahuguna, adding: ""The accused had tortured the woman and damaged her private parts.""The blood-curdling crime took place in a village in Khalwa region, around 50km from the district headquarters and 170km from Indore.The woman, a 45-year-old mother of two, had set out to attend a wedding in the village on Friday night.""After the wedding celebration, she set out on Friday night to drop off a female relative along with one of the accused, Hari, at a nearby field, just half a kilometre from her home. When she didn't return that night, her family assumed she had stayed back with them. The woman went to Hari's home where they consumed alcohol along with co-accused Sunil,"" said ASP Raghuwanshi.According to police, Hari's mother claimed that they were sleeping inside their home on Friday night. On Saturday morning, when she woke up, she heard someone whimpering and stepped out to see who it was. To her horror, she saw the woman in agony, bleeding and barely able to hold herself up.She said she was feeling dizzy and asked in a faint whisper if she could lie down. The next moment, she collapsed in the courtyard, unconscious. The neighbour called the woman's family members.""They took her to their home but did not take her to hospital although she was bleeding excessively. She died around 1:30-2pm after which the family members dialled 100 and informed police. The body was taken to a hospital for post-mortem examination,"" said ASP Raghuwanshi.Preliminary medical examination revealed she had been brutalised with a sharp or hard object and suffered terrible internal injuries.Additional SP Rajesh Raghuwanshi said, ""A short post-mortem report has confirmed grievous internal trauma to the private parts. Based on this, a case of gang rape and murder has been registered against Hari Palvi, 40, and Sunil Korku, 30, residents of the same village who work as labourers.""One of the doctors on the post-mortem panel told TOI on condition of anonymity, ""The woman had suffered vaginal tear in a way that her intestinal contents had come out. She had suffered heavy blood loss due to intestinal bleeding. Her uterus and bladder were intact but the pouch containing the uterus was ripped. It is suspected that a hard object like a rod or a stick was used. Marks of dragging and scratches were also found on the body. ""Family members told police that the woman briefly regained consciousness and told them, ""Something terrible has happened to me, I will not survive. Sunil and Hari did this.""Her son said they were initially unaware of the extent of her injuries. It was only when his wife checked on her that they realized she was bleeding profusely from her private parts. After some time, she gasped and died.Her body was transported to hospital on a tractor.According to the family, the woman was carrying Rs 20,000 - savings handed to her by her younger son and daughter who had recently returned from Goa, where they work with a road construction company. The family suspects that along with the brutal assault, she may have been robbed as well.","Tribal woman, 45, was gangraped and tortured so brutally that she died on Saturday afternoon.

RAMAT GAN: Reservist Haim Halevi had to quit his job and leave his young son behind to fight in Gaza, but still felt ""proud"" to serve after his third call-up in 18 months.Israel's military is activating tens of thousands of reservists for its expanded offensive in Gaza, which it says is aimed at defeating Hamas militants in the Palestinian territory.Despite professional, mental and family challenges, most reservists continue to turn up to fight in a war now in its 20th month.""No one is forcing me... I'm proud to defend my country,"" said Halevi, a 35-year-old father of two and non-commissioned officer in a combat unit.He has served more than 200 days since the war began.Reservists serve on a voluntary basis in Israel, and 75 percent have responded positively to the call, according to a report presented to parliament.The army says approximately 295,000 soldiers have been called up since the war began on October 7, 2023 with Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel.Overall, the reservists have served an average of 61 days a year, compared with just eight pre-war. Combat units like Halevi's often serve longer stints.Halevi described himself as a ""patriot"", but also spoke of the difficulties of returning to the front.Like many reservists, on the morning of October 7 he rushed to the area around Gaza to help repel the Hamas attack, even before receiving a call-up.He was then deployed to the Gaza Strip when Israeli ground operations started, and spent almost five months fighting there.Halevi had to leave his job in IT and regrets not seeing his son, now two, grow up.""I left when he was six months old, and when I came back he already had teeth and hair,"" he said.His upcoming redeployment is also complicating major life events like a move and plans to start a business, but ""there's nothing you can do about it"", he said.""If everyone says it's not the right time for them, who will serve in the reserves?""Every one of his deployments is an ordeal for his wife Michal, 29, who said she dreads his next departure in mid-July.""I'll be alone with two small children -- everything will fall on me,"" she said.She ""got used to the lack of sleep"" caring for their son on her own. ""But being alone in the evenings, it was hard. It was really hard.""Halevi's last tour ended six months ago, with the birth of the couple's daughter.The government recently voted to create a fund of three billion shekels (more than $840 million) to support reservists.""Those who give everything to the state, we must give everything to them,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.But some reservists say the support does not address the roots of the financial hardship they face.A recent Direct Polls survey found that 68 percent of respondents felt the government was not doing enough to support reservists.And while most, like Halevi, have continued to respond positively to call-ups, increasing numbers are refusing.Last week, in a rare case, a reservist who had reportedly already served more than 200 days was given 20 days in military prison for refusing to return over his moral objection to the Gaza war.While the army does not provide details about such refusals, reservists online have called for an end to the war, or at least for the army to stop tapping the same troops for repeated stints.A member of an anti-war reservist group, who gave his name as Stav, told AFP at an event in support of the jailed man that ""more and more soldiers are joining us"".He called refusal a ""patriotic act as an Israeli who believes in the future of this country"".A study by Polly Labs, in conjunction with NGOs, showed that the difficulties reservists and their families face are only getting worse.Based on surveys of more than 2,300 reservist spouses, it found 45 percent of reservists and 68 percent of their spouses reported experiencing emotional distress since the war started.Money problems also affect many, with 47 percent citing daily difficulties and 72 percent of the self-employed reporting direct financial losses.""I am aware of the weight of the mission, the responsibility and the burden we are placing on you and your families,"" army chief Eyal Zamir told reservists at a base in mid-May.Halevi, meanwhile, has created an internet platform, Milnik, which aims to connect donors with reservists in need.""I am proud of him and I support him, but it's difficult,"" his wife said.","Israel's military is activating tens of thousands of reservists for its expanded offensive in Gaza.

What Belgian royal family say about Harvard row







Belgium's future queen Princess Elisabeth is not the only VIP foreign student caught in Donald Trump's legal battle with Harvard. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's daughter Cleo Carney is a first-year student at Harvard. While speculations are rife about whether these VIP international students will have to take admission elsewhere if the Trump administration wins the legal battle, Canada has another issue to worry about. Canada is one of the highest contributors to Harvard's international students after China. And for undergraduate studies, the highest number of international students comes from Canada.Canada has not issued any statement after the Trump administrated barred the university from enrolling foreign students for non-compliance. The administration sought extensive records on nonimmigrant students involved in any crime, violence or illegal activities in the last five years. Harvard did not comply even after the ultimatum and went to the court to get a temporary stay on the order. If Trump wins the legal battle, the existing students will have to transfer to other universities.China, which sends the highest number of students to Harvard, said the ban will tarnish the US's image.“China has consistently opposed the politicization of educational collaboration,” a spokesperson for China’s Foreign Ministry said Friday, adding that the US move “will only tarnish its own image and reputation in the world.”The eldest daughter of Carney and economist Diana Fox Carnet, Cleao Carney, is studying social studies with a minor in energy and the environment. Cleo gained public attention in March 2025 when she introduced her father at the Liberal Party leadership event in Ottawa, where he was announced as Canada’s 24th Prime Minister. Ahead of the election, she advocated for her father as a first-time voter. ""My dad may not be the loudest candidate, but he will always be a principled one. He listens when he could perform. He believes in honesty, not spectacle. That’s what quiet leadership is: work without the ego. And that’s what my dad brings to the table. He’s not running for the spotlight. He’s running so this country can work for all of us,"" she wrote.23-year-old Princess Elisabeth has just finished her first year at Harvard, where she is doing a two-year master's degree in public policy. “The impact of [the Trump administration’s] decision will only become clearer in the coming days/weeks,” Belgian royal palace spokesperson Lore Vandoorne told Reuters. “We are currently investigating the situation.”The palace’s communications director, Xavier Baert, added, “We are analyzing this at the moment and will let things settle. A lot can still happen in the coming days and weeks.”",Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's daughter Cleo Carney is a first-year student at Harvard.

According to officials quoted by the justice department, he confronted a security guard outside the building, spitting on him before trying to flee.

‘He should be alive today’: Ilhan Omar marks 5 years since George Floyd’s murder with call to 'dismantle systemic racism',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/he-should-be-alive-today-ilhan-omar-marks-5-years-since-george-floyds-murder-with-call-to-dismantle-systemic-racism/articleshow/121398981.cms,"Ilhan Omar condemns the brutal murder of George Floyd





On the fifth anniversary of George Floyd’s death, US Congresswoman Ilhan Omar said his murder should never be forgotten and neither should the urgent need to reform America’s criminal justice system.In a series of posts on social media, Omar, who represents Minnesota’s 5th congressional district, said, “It’s been five years since George Floyd’s murder. He should be alive today. No amount of grandstanding or rewriting history will change that fact.” She added, “On this day—and every day—we must commit ourselves to the pursuit of justice. That must include dismantling systemic racism and radically transforming our approach to criminal justice. ”George Floyd was a 46-year-old Black man and was killed in Minneapolis in 2020 when white police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes. The killing, captured on a bystander’s phone, sparked worldwide protests against racial injustice and police brutality. Chauvin was later convicted of murder and sentenced to 22 years in prison.Omar’s message came as people across the country marked five years since George Floyd’s death. In Houston , where Floyd grew up, his family gathered near his gravesite.In Minneapolis, where he was killed, locals held a church service, a candlelight vigil, and a gospel concert at George Floyd Square, the street corner now named after him.In another post, Omar reflected on the wider impact of Floyd’s death. “His murder ignited urgent conversations about the state of our nation, the state of policing, and the state of our justice system — as well as who is entitled to justice,” she wrote. “And unfortunately, as we have seen every time there is a movement for the liberation of Black people, for equality, for justice, we see a backslide — a backlash — where things not only stop progressing, but where people are emboldened to express their racism publicly. ”That backlash, she suggested, could be seen in recent efforts to undo police reforms and diversity programmes introduced in the wake of Floyd’s killing. In Minneapolis, reforms introduced after a federal investigation into police misconduct are under threat, as US President Donald Trump ’s administration has questioned their legitimacy, calling the data used “flawed” and the agreements “handcuffing” local police. However, Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey insisted the city would fully comply with the new consent decree.Nationally, Trump has rolled back Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) policies across federal agencies and the military. In Washington DC, the Black Lives Matter Plaza has been removed. In Houston, a famous mural of Floyd was recently demolished as part of a building teardown.Omar also condemned those calling for Chauvin to be pardoned. “We are seeing unjust calls for Chauvin to be pardoned,” she wrote. “Regardless of any federal pardon, he still faces the state murder conviction and will remain in jail. He will always be known to the people of this country and the world as a murderer.”Her posts come as surveys show a drop in public belief that Floyd’s death led to lasting change. According to a recent Pew Research Center poll, 72% of Americans say little or no improvement has been made in the lives of Black people. Support for the Black Lives Matter movement has also declined by 15% since its peak in 2020.Floyd’s family and supporters have continued to honour his memory and push for lasting reform. “We still have a lot of work before we see true justice and liberation,” Omar said. “But today I’m thinking of George Floyd’s family as they continue to grieve his loss. May he forever rest in power.”",US Congresswoman Ilhan Omar said his murder should never be forgotten and neither should the urgent need to reform America’s criminal justice system. George Floyd was a 46-year-old Black man and was killed in Minneapolis in 2020 when white police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121398985,imgsize-874255,width-400,resizemode-4/121398985.jpg"
Former Obama aide reveals why he stayed silent on Joe Biden’s health decline: 'Wanted him to win...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/former-obama-aide-reveals-why-he-stayed-silent-on-joe-bidens-health-decline-wanted-him-to-win-/articleshow/121398386.cms,"Ex-Obama aide on Biden's health decline





Former Obama speechwriter and “Pod Save America” host Jon Lovett has admitted that he held back concerns about Joe Biden ’s health during the 2024 campaign because he wanted Biden to win re-election.Speaking on Jon Stewart’s “The Weekly Show” podcast, Lovett said he was worried about the president’s physical and cognitive state but chose not to talk about it publicly. “I remember feeling I want to talk about this as a huge liability. To talk about this is something Joe Biden can overcome, but I’m not going to go so far as to say, ‘I think Joe Biden must drop out. He is too old to be president,’” Lovett said.He added, “A, because I didn’t know exactly what was going on behind the scenes, but B, if Joe Biden is the candidate, I want him to f—king win.”Lovett admitted he feared that any criticism from the left would be used by Biden’s political enemies. “It was about being honest about Joe Biden’s age as a liability while knowing that if he is the nominee, I want to be clear that I thought it was important to make sure we did everything we could to reelect him,” he said.He explained his reluctance further: “Having the words we’re saying taken out of context and all of a sudden be part of the case against Joe Biden from the right — that would use any person criticising Joe Biden from the left as a weapon against him.”The issue of Biden’s health has been drawing more attention, especially following the release of the book Original Sin by CNN’s Jake Tapper and Axios’s Alex Thompson. The book claims the White House deliberately tried to downplay concerns about Biden’s decline.Lovett himself features in Original Sin, in an anecdote describing a meeting with Biden on April 26, 2024, alongside co-hosts Jon Favreau and Dan Pfeiffer. According to the book, the trio were left “deeply disturbed” after the meeting, reportedly finding Biden “rambling” and “incoherent.”US President Donald Trump has also criticised Biden's physical and mental decline. Last week, Biden, who is 82 years old, was diagnosed with prostate cancer. Doctors have described the form of cancer as 'aggressive'.","Former Obama speechwriter and ""Pod Save America"" host Jon Lovett has admitted that he held back concerns about Joe Biden ’s health during the 2024 campaign.

Poll Do you believe that climate change is contributing to extreme weather events in Pakistan? Yes No





At least 14 people were killed and more than 100 injured after powerful windstorms swept across central and northern Pakistan following a days-long heatwave, officials confirmed on Sunday.The storms, described as “particularly destructive” by authorities, battered the provinces of Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa as well as Islamabad on Saturday afternoon and evening.Mazhar Hussain, spokesperson for the Punjab disaster management authority, was quoted by news agency AFP as saying, “This windstorm was particularly destructive. The wind speed was very high. There was so much dust in it that visibility was greatly reduced.”According to him, the extreme weather followed several days of intense heat, with temperatures exceeding 45°C. “There were three to four days in the recent heatwave where temperatures went up quite a lot,” he added, attributing the sudden storm to the intense build-up of heat.The majority of casualties were caused by collapsing roofs and walls, while at least two people died after being struck by solar panels dislodged by high-speed winds.In one tragic incident, lightning claimed the life of one man and injured three others.The storms uprooted trees, knocked over electric poles, and caused significant damage to vehicles and infrastructure. Social media was flooded with dramatic videos showing the aftermath, including a viral clip filmed inside a passenger plane struggling to land in Lahore before being diverted to Karachi amid severe turbulence.Islamabad and surrounding areas have also seen multiple unusual hailstorms over April and May, damaging vehicles and solar panels—marking a growing trend of erratic and extreme weather events in the country.Pakistan is widely recognised as one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change, with early summers and intense heatwaves becoming increasingly common.India is also battling extreme temperatures. According to news agency ANI, Rajasthan's Jaisalmer hit 48°C, forcing locals indoors. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) warned that severe heatwave conditions will continue in Rajasthan until May 27 and in Punjab, Haryana, and Jammu and Kashmir until May 26.Meanwhile, heavy monsoon rainfall has already arrived on India’s west coast, with IMD forecasting intense downpours over Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Goa in the coming week.Back in Pakistan, the Meteorological Department has predicted more storms on Sunday, raising concerns about further damage and casualties.","Powerful windstorms swept across central and northern Pakistan following a days- long heatwave.

Poll Do you believe that the assassination of journalists in Balochistan is a systematic issue? Yes, it is a systematic issue. No, it's an isolated incident.





Abdul Latif Baloch, a well-known journalist in Pakistan's Balochistan province, was shot dead inside his home in Mashkay, in the wee hours of Saturday.The Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), a local rights group, confirmed that he was shot by state-backed armed groups at around 3 am, in front of his wife and children, reported news agency ANI.Latif was respected for his fearless coverage of human rights abuses and military operations in Balochistan. His work focused on enforced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and the struggle of ordinary Baloch citizens. His death underlines the extreme risk faced by reporters in Pakistan.This incident comes just months after his son, Saif Baloch, and seven other family members were reportedly abducted by security forces and later found dead. Activists describe these patterns of violence as part of Pakistan’s “kill and dump” policy, used to silence dissent and suppress the Baloch identity.Shalee Baloch of the Baloch Women Forum described the killing as part of “systemic violence” against the Baloch people. She urged international organisations and media to intervene, saying silence from the global community is enabling further bloodshed.Human rights groups and press freedom organisations have condemned the assassination and are calling for urgent international pressure on Pakistan with regard to Balochistan. The region has been the site of persistent and grave human rights violations, including enforced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and the suppression of dissenting voices.","Abdul Latif Baloch, a well-known journalist in Pakistan's Balochistan province, was shot dead inside his home in Mashkay.

Jailed former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has ruled out any negotiations with Pakistan's civilian government, declaring that only talks with the country’s military establishment are meaningful.In a post on X, Khan said, “Engaging in any talks with the puppet Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) government is pointless. This illegitimate Form-47 installed government has already wasted two months. Its only objective is to cling to false authority. It holds no real power.”Khan, who has been behind bars since August 2023 in multiple cases following the collapse of his government in April 2022, stressed that negotiations would only be held with those who actually “hold power”, the military establishment, and only in the national interest.“I do not fear hardship as my resolve remains strong,” he said, while alleging that political cases, abductions, and forced press conferences were being used to dismantle his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party. “All prove that the rule of law has been entirely dismantled. What we now have is the law of the jungle,” he added.Reiterating his stance from earlier this week, Khan stated that May 9, 2023, the day of violent protests after his arrest, was a “false flag operation” designed to crush PTI.“No CCTV footage has been presented to this day... The truth will be evident to all if the CCTV footage of that day is made public,” he added, as reported by news agency PTI.In a separate post, Khan also dismissed media reports suggesting that a deal was in the works with the military. “No one has approached me for any negotiations. News claiming otherwise is entirely false,” he said, adding that despite harsh jail conditions, including denial of access to his children and physician, he remains steadfast.He recently took a swipe at Army chief General Asim Munir’s promotion to Field Marshal, saying “it might have been more fitting to give him the title of ‘King’ instead, because right now, the country is ruled by the law of the jungle. And in the jungle, there is only one king,” as per PTI.Meanwhile, the Punjab government said Khan has refused to undergo polygraph and voice analysis tests in 12 terrorism cases linked to the May 9 riots for the third consecutive time.Pakistani Punjab’s information minister Azma Bokhari accused Khan of defying court orders, saying he made repeated excuses to avoid the tests. “He must understand this is Adiala Jail, not his Bani Gala residence,” she said.The trial in the GHQ attack case, which was last heard in February, has been adjourned again until May 29. Separately, the hearing in the Toshakhana-II case was postponed to May 26.Khan’s party has also urged the Islamabad High Court to speed up hearings in the Al-Qadir Trust case involving Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi.

Sindhudesh as an independent nation: JSMM demands UN recognition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/sindhudesh-as-an-independent-nation-jsmm-demands-un-recognition/articleshow/121359382.cms,"ANI image





The Jeay Sindh Muttahida Mahaz (JSMM), a Sindhi nationalist group led by exiled chairman Shafi Burfat, has issued a renewed plea to the United Nations and other international communities, urging recognition of Sindhudesh as an independent nation and calling attention to what it describes as sustained political repression and human rights violations in Pakistan ’s Sindh province.In a comprehensive political manifesto titled The Sindhudesh Global Freedom Charter, JSMM has approached the United Nations, international human rights bodies, democratic governments, and global civil society organizations, arguing that the Sindhi people are subject to a form of internal colonialism under Pakistan’s military and political establishment.In a direct appeal to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Indian public, JSMM cited historical and cultural ties between Sindh and India, requesting moral and political solidarity. The group also called on international institutions to send human rights observers, document alleged violations, and engage with Sindh’s demand for peaceful self-determination.JSMM alleges that demographic engineering through state-sponsored resettlement has diluted Sindh’s ethnic composition, threatening the linguistic and cultural identity of the Sindhi people. Environmental degradation, particularly the diversion of the Indus river’s waters, has compounded local grievances, with widespread desertification of once-fertile lands cited as an ecological consequence of state policy.The statement firmly condemned Pakistan's security forces for committing serious human rights abuses in Sindh, including enforced disappearances, torture, and extrajudicial killings of political activists, journalists, and student leaders. It mentioned that anti-terrorism legislation is being misused to target secular and nationalist movements, whereas religious extremists receive support from the state.Positioning itself as a secular, democratic movement, JSMM has reiterated its vision for a sovereign Republic of Sindhudesh, grounded in principles of equality, minority protections, and social justice. The group invokes international law including the United Nations Charter and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) to support Sindh’s right to self-determination.Long before modern borders were drawn, Sindh flourished as the heart of the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation which was a sophisticated urban society that emerged over 5,000 years ago along the banks of the Indus river. With advanced city planning, intricate craftsmanship, and a vibrant mercantile culture, Sindh was once a beacon of early human progress. Mohenjo-daro, one of the civilisation’s most iconic sites, still stands as a testament to the region’s intellectual and architectural legacy. This deep-rooted historical identity is central to the Sindhi nationalist narrative, which views contemporary political struggles as a continuation of a civilizational arc interrupted by colonial conquests and post partition state formation.I n the colonial era, Sindh existed as a distinct administrative region under British India before being annexed, and eventually was re-established as a separate province in 1936. Advocates for Sindhi autonomy argue that this period fostered a unique political consciousness, one that emphasized cultural plurality and regional pride. The Partition of 1947, however, redrew not just boundaries but identities. Over subsequent decades, Sindhi activists have pointed to a pattern of political marginalization and centralized control, arguing that their historical autonomy has been systematically pulled apart.Framing Sindh’s struggle as both civilisational and contemporary, the charter situated the region within the historical legacy of the Indus valley civilisation, asserting that Sindh was forced into joining Pakistan in 1947 and has since faced cultural erasure and economic exploitation. The document claims that Sindh's resources including oil, gas, coal, fertile farmland, and deep-sea ports have been systematically extracted to benefit other regions, while the local population remains economically marginalised.While JSMM’s claims are politically charged and remain unacknowledged by the Pakistani state, the charter marks a significant step in internationalizing what has largely been a domestic conflict.","The Jeay Sindh Muttahida Mahaz (JSMM), a Sindhi nationalist group led by exiled chairman Shafi Burfat, has issued a renewed plea to the United Nations.

A promotion after defeat: What's behind Asim Munir's Field Marshal gambit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/field-marshal-asim-munir-pakistan-army-chief-operation-sindoor-india-and-pakistan/articleshow/121319156.cms,"Asim Munir’s grip on power may look firm, but it’s anything but secure.

Promotion or protection?

Officially, the move is being framed as a recognition of ""strategic brilliance."" PM Sharif praised Munir’s ""decisive defeat of the enemy,"" asserting that under his leadership, the military ""staunchly defended Pakistan’s sovereignty."" Munir himself called the promotion ""an honour for the armed forces and the nation.""

But few outside Pakistan’s tightly controlled media landscape are buying it.

""Field Marshal rank is usually conferred after a military victory,"" Tilak Devasher, a seasoned Pakistan watcher, told the Economic Times. ""This may be the first time it has been awarded after a defeat-it seems intended to mask that defeat.""

The timing is hard to ignore. Pakistan’s public is still reeling from the fallout of the India strikes, and internal dissent within the army is reportedly rising.

A widely circulated letter from a group calling itself ""The Guardians of Honour"" accused Munir of corruption and military incompetence. The letter reflects what some analysts say is quiet but growing discontent within senior ranks.

A shield against scrutiny

All ceremony, no strategy

The big picture: The war at home

Munir’s rise comes at a fragile moment for Pakistan. The ceasefire with India has held for now. But underneath the diplomatic calm lies a volatile domestic landscape:

Security turmoil: Over 3,700 terror incidents have claimed nearly 3,900 lives in the past 17 months, according to ISPR figures-pointing to a deteriorating internal security climate, especially in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

With rising inflation, IMF-dependency, and India's suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, Pakistan's economy teeters on the edge. The military’s growing political role is being scrutinized for exacerbating the instability. Observers note that Munir is not merely defending national borders-he is navigating a labyrinth of domestic vulnerabilities that could unravel his authority.

His use of the two-nation theory and religious rhetoric to frame the India conflict was seen by critics as an attempt to rally the nation behind him. But the strategy may have backfired. ""Instead of unifying the nation, the gambit drew attention to Pakistan’s widening fractures,"" write analysts Ashok Behuria and Uttam Sinha in a joint commentary in the TOI.

The ghost of Imran Khan

What’s next

Munir’s elevation to Field Marshal is not about military strategy-it’s about political survival. It’s about shoring up a fractured command structure, muffling dissent, and projecting strength in the face of growing weakness.

Though the promotion may temporarily strengthen Munir’s position, it doesn’t erase the challenges ahead:

Internal threats persist, from Baloch separatists to the resurgent Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan.

PTI's political comeback looms, with Khan’s moral leverage growing even from prison.

Civil-military tension could intensify, especially if the rank is seen as an attempt to silence dissent or circumvent institutional checks.

There’s also talk of Munir eventually transitioning into a political role-possibly even as president. Ayub Khan set the precedent. In Pakistan’s fragile democracy, few would be surprised if history rhymed again.





In a move steeped more in symbolism than substance, Pakistan’s powerful army chief General Asim Munir has been elevated to the rarefied rank of Field Marshal . The announcement, made on Tuesday by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s cabinet, marks the first such promotion in over six decades. Only one other man-military dictator Ayub Khan in 1959-has held the title.But unlike Ayub, who awarded himself the rank amid consolidating his political power, Munir’s elevation comes on the heels of a military debacle. A bruising exchange with India, following a deadly attack in Pahalgam, resulted in India striking at least nine Pakistani air bases. The damage, while officially downplayed in Pakistan, left Munir politically exposed.So why the promotion? And why now?In a country where generals often enjoy impunity, the Field Marshal title may serve more as legal and political armor than as a mark of distinction. Some analysts see the promotion as a pre-emptive move to insulate Munir from possible court martial or early retirement, the ET report said.Legal experts point out that the Pakistani constitution makes no mention of the rank.Nor does the Pakistan Army Act. Instead, the promotion was reportedly made under Rule 199A of the Army Regulations (1998), which states that a general may be promoted to Field Marshal ""without regard to seniority or any specific appointment.""In essence, the move raises Munir above the military’s existing command structure-and, potentially, above accountability.Though technically ceremonial, the rank carries potent political meaning. In Pakistan’s civil-military power dynamic, optics often matter more than operational command.""Munir is now very much in the driving seat as the pivot of the power structure,"" said Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed, former chair of the Senate defense committee. ""Given the weakness and divisions amongst the civilian politicians... all the mainstream political forces were convinced that the road to Islamabad lies through Rawalpindi.""That reality is reflected in the government’s simultaneous decision to extend the term of air chief marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu-his second extension. Sidhu was credited with executing Operation Bunyanun Marsoos, Pakistan’s retaliatory air campaign against India's Operation Sindoor Still, in a tightly managed information environment, the military’s version of events prevails. State media declared a historic victory. Social media was flooded with hashtags like #PakistanStandsUnited. Meanwhile, dissenting voices-journalists, analysts, even former officers-vanished from screens.Munir’s political calculus also includes a rising challenge from behind bars: Former Prime Minister Imran Khan. His PTI party has labeled Munir a ""warmonger and coward,"" accusing him of dragging Pakistan into war to consolidate power. Khan’s moral authority, paradoxically strengthened by his imprisonment, continues to mobilize his base.Sharif’s civilian government, already seen as beholden to the military, risks further erosion of legitimacy. As one viral meme put it: ""War fought by Airforce. Army Chief promoted. Army’s only contribution-taking videos of tanks and hiding in bunkers.""(With inputs from agencies)","Pakistan's powerful army chief Asim Munir has been elevated to the rank of Field Marshal.

Pakistan Supreme Court upholds death penalty in beheading case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-supreme-court-upholds-death-penalty-in-beheading-case/articleshow/121300483.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: In a landmark judgment, the Supreme Court of Pakistan on Tuesday upheld the death sentence of Zahir Jaffer , convicted of the gruesome 2021 murder of Noor Mukadam, the 27-year-old daughter of a former Pakistani diplomat.The decision, delivered by a three-member bench led by Justice Hashim Kakar, reaffirmed the judiciary’s stance on a case that has gripped the nation and exposed deep-seated issues of gender violence and privilege in Pakistan’s elite circles. The ruling, however, also raises questions about the consistency of justice in a country where systemic inequalities often shield the powerful.The case, one of the most high-profile in Pakistan’s recent history, stems from the horrific events of July 20, 2021, when Noor Mukadam was found tortured and beheaded at Jaffer’s residence in Islamabad’s upscale Sector F-7/4.Jaffer, a Pakistani-American and son of a wealthy industrialist, was arrested at the scene, covered in blood. Investigations revealed that Mukadam, a childhood acquaintance, was held hostage for two days, tortured with a knuckleduster, raped, and ultimately decapitated after allegedly rejecting Jaffer’s marriage proposal. The brutality of the crime, coupled with the elite status of both the victim and the perpetrator, sparked nationwide outrage and reignited debates over violence against women in Pakistan.The apex court’s verdict dismissed Jaffer’s appeal, which claimed “erroneous appreciation” of evidence and questioned the fairness of the trial due to media influence. The court upheld the death penalty for murder but converted Jaffer’s second death sentence for rape to life imprisonment, citing legal considerations.“This is not just my daughter’s case; it is a case for all the daughters of Pakistan,” said Shaukat Mukadam, Noor’s father. The ruling has been hailed by many as a victory for accountability, with social media posts on X reflecting public relief: “I hope Noor’s parents will sleep a little better tonight,” wrote one user, while another called it a “win for humanity.” Yet, the decision also exposes uncomfortable truths about Pakistan’s legal and social landscape.Critics argue that the case’s prominence owes much to the victim’s elite background, highlighting a stark disparity in how justice is pursued. “Mukadam’s status as a diplomat’s daughter shone a spotlight on her murder,” said women’s rights activist Tahira Abdullah, noting that countless similar cases involving less privileged women rarely garner such attention or swift judicial action.

Pakistan promotes army chief Munir to 5-star rank of Field Marshal for ‘crushing enemy’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-promotes-army-chief-munir-to-5-star-rank-of-field-marshal-for-crushing-enemy/articleshow/121300334.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: The Shehbaz Sharif govt in Pakistan promoted Tuesday army chief Syed Asim Munir from general to the five-star rank of Field Marshal in recognition of what it described as “exemplary leadership” while responding to India’s Operation Sindoor and bringing “great honour to our motherland”.For a country that has had four military rulers at different periods in its history, Field Marshal Munir is only the second Army chief to have been elevated to the apex rank, modelled on the British army’s structure. The first one, Field Marshal Ayub Khan, assumed the rank in 1959 while he was President, citing “requests” from Pakistani civil society.PM Shehbaz’s office announced that the cabinet unanimously decided to also continue the services of Air Chief Marshal Zahar Ahmed Babar Sidhu after his term ends.The statement also claimed that Pakistan downed five Indian jets and thwarted “further incursions”, leading to a US-mediated pause in military operations from May 10. Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the army’s media affairs wing, quoted Field Marshal Munir as dedicating the honour to “the nation, armed forces, and martyrs”.In a congratulatory statement on X, Shehbaz credited Field Marshal Munir with orchestrating a “high strategy” during the conflict with India, which escalated with the latter’s May 6-7 airstrikes targeting nine terrorist sites.Operation Sindoor was India’s response to 26 deaths in the April 22 terrorist attack on tourists in J&K’s Pahalgam.Without naming India, Shehbaz said that under Field Marshal Munir, the army “crushed the enemy’s nefarious designs”.With Pakistan’s history of military coups looming large, newly coronated Field Marshal Munir is widely seen as the kingmaker behind Shehbaz’s premiership. Critics of the move within Pakistan argue the promotion strengthens the military’s grip over civilian governance, especially amid domestic challenges like the Baloch insurgency and economic woes.The timing of the promotion, coinciding with Pakistan seeking US and EU’s support to counter “India’s terrorism narrative”, suggests a bid to project strength.While the PM's office and ISPR frame Field Marshal Munir’s elevation as a tribute to national resilience, its political undertones and opaque military claims raise concerns about democratic backsliding and regional instability.","Shehbaz Sharif govt in Pakistan promoted Tuesday army chief Syed Asim Munir from general to the five-star rank of Field Marshal.

DHAKA: The Bangladesh interim govt has said necessary steps will be taken together with the people if under ""instigation of defeated forces or as part of a foreign conspiracy"", the govt's performance of responsibilities becomes impossible.This came amid a growing rift between Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus and the military leadership over a controversial proposal to facilitate a ""humanitarian corridor"" to Myanmar and days after the govt refuted a key ally's claim that Yunus had mulled resignation. ""The interim govt will take necessary decisions together with the people of the country if the govt's autonomy, reform efforts, justice process, fair election plan, and normal operations are obstructed to the point of making its duties unmanageable,"" the council of advisers said in a statement after an unscheduled meeting on Saturday.It said that if ""under the instigation of defeated forces or as part of a foreign conspiracy, the performance of these responsibilities becomes impossible, the govt will present all reasons to the public and then take the necessary steps with the people"".During a series of meetings on Saturday and Sunday, Yunus also rejected demands by major national parties, including BNP, to hold the national election by Dec this year, reiterating that the poll will be held in 2026 but not after June.""Muhammad Yunus is a man of his word. He gave a cut-off time. He won't go beyond that,"" chief adviser's press secretary Shafiqul Alam told reporters referring to the election likely to be held between Dec 2025 and June next year.Leaders of BNP, Jamaat-e-Islami, National Citizen Party and other political parties, except Awami League, held separate meetings with Yunus. NCP members said local govt polls should be held ahead of the national election - a demand being seen as the party's bid to have a chance at making its position stronger at the grassroots-level before the Bangladesh poll.","Bangladesh interim govt says necessary steps will be taken together with the people if under ""instigation of defeated forces or as part of a foreign conspiracy"" This came amid a growing rift between Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus and the military leadership.

DHAKA: Bangladesh began the first trial on Sunday at a special court prosecuting former senior figures connected to the ousted government of Sheikh Hasina, the chief prosecutor said.The court in the capital Dhaka accepted a formal charge against eight police officials in connection to the killing of six protesters on August 5 last year, the day Hasina fled the country as the protesters stormed her palace.The eight men are charged with crimes against humanity.

Poll Do you believe that Afghanistan is adequately prepared for natural disasters? Yes No





An earthquake of magnitude 4.2 struck Afghanistan in the early hours of Sunday, marking the fifth tremor to jolt the country in just over a week. According to the National Center for Seismology (NCS), the latest earthquake occurred at 6.33am IST at a depth of 135 kms.So far, there have been no confirmed reports of injuries or structural damage, though assessments are still underway.The region experienced four previous earthquakes between May 16 and May 20. On Monday, May 19, a 4.2 magnitude quake was recorded. A day earlier, on May 18, a slightly stronger 4.5 magnitude earthquake struck at a depth of 150 kms. Prior to that, quakes of magnitudes 4.2 and 4.0 were reported on May 17 and 16, respectively.The recent spike in seismic activity has raised concerns among experts and residents alike. Afghanistan, particularly the Hindu Kush region, is recognised as a seismically active zone due to its location along the collision boundary between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. A major fault line also runs through the western province of Herat, further amplifying the region’s vulnerability.The International Red Cross and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) have frequently highlighted Afghanistan’s susceptibility to natural disasters, including earthquakes, landslides, and seasonal flooding.More information is awaited as monitoring agencies continue to assess the impact.","The latest earthquake occurred at 6.33am IST at a depth of 135 kms.

Alan Yentob, a pioneering figure in British broadcasting and the creative force behind decades of acclaimed BBC content, has died aged 78, his family confirmed on Saturday.Yentob joined the BBC in 1968 as a trainee and went on to become one of its most influential and recognisable figures. His long career spanned roles including controller of BBC One and Two, head of music and arts, director of television, and the organisation's first creative director, a position he held for more than a decade.His wife, Philippa Walker, paid tribute, calling Yentob “curious, funny, annoying, late and creative in every cell of his body,” and remembered him as “the kindest of men and a profoundly moral man.” She added, “Our life was exciting, he was exciting.”Yentob was widely celebrated for his contribution to arts programming. He edited and presented acclaimed series like Arena, Omnibus and Imagine, which profiled major cultural figures including David Bowie , Maya Angelou, Grayson Perry, and Charles Saatchi. His 1975 Omnibus documentary Cracked Actor, which followed a fragile but creatively explosive Bowie, remains one of his most iconic works.As per BBC, Yentob recalled it captured the singer at his “most fragile and exhausted.”BBC director-general Tim Davie described Yentob as “a creative force and a cultural visionary” whose “passion wasn’t performative – it was personal.” He added, “To work with Alan was to be inspired and encouraged to think bigger. He believed in the power of culture to enrich, challenge and connect us.”According to The Guardian, Davie also said Yentob had “a rare gift for identifying talent and lifting others up – a mentor and champion to so many across the worlds of television, film and theatre.”During his leadership at BBC Two from 1988, Yentob helped launch Absolutely Fabulous, Have I Got News for You and The Late Show. His work was influential in shaping the broadcaster’s arts and comedy output, and he also helped develop children's channels CBBC and CBeebies.Born in London in 1947 into an Iraqi Jewish family, Yentob grew up in Greater Manchester and studied law at the University of Leeds. When he joined the BBC World Service, he was the only non-Oxbridge graduate among his peers that year, reported The Guardian.Yentob's career wasn't without controversy. In 2015, he resigned as the BBC’s creative director amid scrutiny over his role as chairman of the charity Kids Company, which collapsed the same year. He denied any conflict of interest but admitted the coverage had become a “serious distraction” for the broadcaster, according to the BBC.Despite this, he continued producing content and was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2024 for services to the arts and media.Tributes have poured in from colleagues and friends. Actress Dawn French posted a photo with Yentob and Jennifer Saunders, calling him “our advocate from the start” and “a tip top chap.” The Pet Shop Boys called him “a legend in British TV” on social media, noting he was behind some of the BBC’s “finest programmes.”BBC Radio 4 presenter Amol Rajan called him “a towering figure in the culture of post-war Britain” and described his shows as “always brilliant, often masterpieces, sometimes seminal.” Rajan added: “He oozed fortitude until the very last… one of the most generous, influential, singular, passionate, supportive, creative and loved men of his generation.”Yentob is survived by his wife, Philippa Walker, and their two children.","Alan Yentob, a pioneering figure in British broadcasting, has died aged 78.

EDINBURGH: The Scottish Government has reaffirmed its commitment to supporting religious freedom and human rights for the Tibetan people, especially concerning the reincarnation of the 14th Dalai Lama , as reported by the central tibetan administration (CTA).In a session of the Scottish Parliament held on May 22, MSP Ross Greer raised inquiries about the Scottish government's preparations to celebrate the upcoming 90th birthday of the 14th Dalai Lama alongside the Buddhist community in Scotland and highlighted concerns over potential Chinese interference in the reincarnation process, as noted by the CTA.In reply, the minister for equalities Kaukab Stewart, expressed the Scottish Government's gratitude for the contributions made by various faith and belief communities in Scotland, including Buddhists.She conveyed warm wishes to Dalai Lama and the Buddhist community, acknowledging their vital role in promoting peace, compassion, and cultural diversity in the country, as emphasised in the CTA report.MSP Ross Greer also reminded everyone of the Chinese government's abduction of the six-year-old Panchen Lama three decades ago and the subsequent replacement with another boy.Greer articulated concerns that are widely held among Tibetans regarding the possibility of similar interference regarding the reincarnation of the 14th Dalai Lama in the future.He inquired if the Scottish Government would commit to recognising only a future Dalai Lama chosen according to Tibetan Buddhist traditions and teachings, free from outside influence.Stewart asserted, ""The Scottish Government upholds the principles of religious freedom and human rights. It believes that the Tibetan Buddhist community should have the autonomy to select the next Dalai Lama without external interference,"" as stated by the CTA.Since the 1950s, Tibetans in China have experienced persecution following the Chinese government's annexation of Tibet.

What is the Kneecap controversy? Pro-Palestine Band charged with terror offences,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/what-is-the-kneecap-controversy-pro-palestine-band-charged-with-terror-offences/articleshow/121360089.cms,"What is Kneecap?



How the Kneecap controversy started?



Terror charge and legal proceedings

Political activism and support for Palestine

Rise to global fame through film

Controversial performances and symbolism



Footage and investigations

Public apology and Band response

Cancelled shows and political reaction





Kneecap, an Irish Band, hailed as cultural disruptors by supporters and branded dangerous extremists by critics, has been thrust into the global spotlight after one of its members was charged with a terror offence in the United Kingdom. Liam Og O hAnnaidh, known on stage as Mo Chara, faces charges related to allegedly displaying a Hezbollah flag during a performance in London. This legal development follows a series of controversies involving the band’s outspoken support for the Palestinian cause, provocative performances, and incendiary lyrics that have drawn fierce political and media backlash. The trio’s actions have prompted investigations, concert cancellations, and calls for bans, all while igniting intense debates about the limits of artistic freedom, political expression, and national security.Formed in 2017, Kneecap is a politically charged rap trio from west Belfast, composed of Mo Chara (Liam Og O hAnnaidh), Moglai Bap (Naoise O Caireallain), and DJ Provai (JJ O Dochartaigh). Known for their fusion of Irish and English lyrics, the group embraces themes of resistance, identity, and satire, often courting controversy through provocative imagery and performances. All three members are fluent Irish speakers, and their music is seen as both a celebration and a defence of the Irish language.Their debut single, “CEARTA,” released during a campaign for Irish language rights in Northern Ireland, set the tone for their defiant public persona.The controversy escalated when London’s Metropolitan Police confirmed that Mo Chara had been charged with a terror offence under UK law. The charge stems from a performance on 21 November 2024, during which video footage appeared to show him displaying a Hezbollah flag and shouting slogans allegedly in support of proscribed terrorist groups. Both Hezbollah and Hamas are designated terrorist organisations in the UK, and it is illegal to publicly express support for them. Mo Chara is due to appear before Westminster Magistrates’ Court on 18 June. The UK’s Counter Terrorism Command was reportedly alerted to the video in April 2025, leading to the charge after consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service.On 21 May 2025, UK authorities officially charged Mo Chara (under the legal name Liam O’Hanna) with a terror offence. The charge relates to the alleged display of a Hezbollah flag during a concert at the O2 Forum in Kentish Town in November 2023. The Crown Prosecution Service authorised the charge following an investigation prompted by an online video. Mo Chara is scheduled to appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on 18 June.Kneecap’s strong pro-Palestinian stance has become a focal point of international attention. During their set at the Coachella festival in April 2025, the band displayed on-screen messages condemning Israel for genocide and accusing the United States of enabling war crimes. One message read: “F*** Israel. Free Palestine.” These statements triggered significant backlash from US commentators, including Sharon Osbourne, who called for their US work visas to be revoked and likened the group to a “Hamas fan club. ” The band’s manager later revealed they had received serious death threats as a result of their comments.Kneecap’s influence expanded rapidly following the release of their semi-fictionalised film in 2024, which starred Oscar-nominated actor Michael Fassbender. The film was both a critical and commercial success, earning six BAFTA nominations and winning for Outstanding Debut. It also secured four awards from the Irish Film and Television Academy, including Best Director for Rich Peppiatt. The film depicted the band’s origins, blending humour, music, and social commentary, and was praised by international outlets like The Independent, which called it “a sweary, crude, and brilliantly political Irish comedy. ”Throughout their career, Kneecap has attracted criticism for what some view as the glamorisation of drug use and militant Irish republicanism. They have worn balaclavas in the colours of the Irish flag during performances and sparked outrage by commissioning a mural in Belfast of a burning police Land Rover, seen by opponents as glorifying terrorism. Their lyrics and public appearances frequently contain anti-British sentiment, including a song titled “Get Your Brits Out” and chants calling for British withdrawal from Northern Ireland.Following Coachella, old videos resurfaced of Kneecap performances in London, allegedly showing Mo Chara displaying a Hezbollah flag and shouting slogans such as “Up Hamas, up Hezbollah.” Another clip included the statement: “The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.” These incidents led to a criminal investigation by London’s Metropolitan Police, involving counter-terrorism officers. As both Hamas and Hezbollah are proscribed as terrorist organisations in the UK, expressions of support for them are criminal offences.Amid growing backlash, Kneecap issued an apology to the families of murdered British MPs Jo Cox and David Amess, stating they never intended to incite violence and expressed regret for any pain caused. The group reaffirmed their message of “love, inclusion, and hope” and rejected claims of promoting terrorism. They also alleged they were the target of a “coordinated smear campaign,” particularly from the United States, and announced plans to pursue legal action against what they described as malicious misinformation.As the controversy intensified, several of Kneecap’s scheduled concerts in the UK and Germany were cancelled. The British government urged Glastonbury organisers to reconsider the band’s participation in the upcoming festival. Politicians, including UK Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, called for Kneecap to be banned entirely from performing. In contrast, a group of artists including Pulp, Annie Mac, Massive Attack, Paul Weller, and Primal Scream signed an open letter in support of the band’s right to political expression.The Kneecap controversy has become a flashpoint in debates over free speech, artistic freedom, and the boundaries of political activism in music. While their supporters view the band as fearless truth-tellers and cultural revolutionaries, critics argue that their methods flirt with extremism and incite division. As legal proceedings continue, the world will be watching to see how the justice system, the music industry, and public discourse respond to a band that has consistently refused to play by the rules.","Liam Og O hAnnaidh, known on stage as Mo Chara, faces charges related to allegedly displaying a Hezbollah flag during a performance in London.
