NEW DELHI: West Bengal leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari on Friday sent a legal notice to chief minister Mamata Banerjee after she made allegation against him and Union home minister Amit Shah over coal smuggling case.Adhikari demanded Mamata to prove the allegations made by her within 72 hours, adding that failure to do so would compel him to initiate appropriate civil and criminal proceedings for defamation.In a social media post on X, Adhikari said that chief minister's allegations were made in a desperate attempt to divert attention from the ongoing investigation by Enforcement Directorate.""Today, CM Mamata Banerjee, in a desperate attempt to divert attention from an ongoing ED investigation, made absolutely baseless defamatory allegations against me, linking me to an 'alleged' coal scam alongside the Hon'ble Union Home Minister. These reckless statements, laced with personal insults, were made publicly without any shred of evidence. Such unsubstantiated claims not only tarnished my reputation but also undermine the dignity of public discourse,"" Adhikari said.""Today, through my Advocate, I have served a Legal Notice demanding that she provide all purported evidence within 72 hours. If she fails to do so, I will pursue appropriate Civil and Criminal actions for Defamation,"" he added.This comes after Mamata alleged that Amit Shah and Suvendu Adhikari were involved in the alleged coal scam and claimed that money from the scam was routed to Amit Shah through Adhikari.The chief minister made these remarks while addressing a public gathering amid protests against the Enforcement Directorate (ED) raid in Kolkata's I-PAC office on Thursday.In the notice, the leader of opposition termed the chief minister's statements as ""reckless, baseless, and wholly unsubstantiated,"" accusing her of making defamatory allegations without producing any evidence.""It has come to the knowledge of my client that on 08.01.2026 and again on 09.01.2026, you have made reckless, baseless, and wholly unsubstantiated allegations against my client by publicly insinuating that my client, along with the Union Home Minister of India, is involved in an alleged coal scam. You have further claimed that you are in possession of evidence in support of such allegations,"" the notice read.""On the contrary, my client states that such statements appear to be part of a calculated and sinister design to divert public attention from serious issues concerning you, your family members, and your political party, which are presently engaging public scrutiny...,"" it added.This comes after Mamata, while addressing a gathering, said, ""You know who is sitting in the Election Commission. He was the Cooperation Department Secretary of Amit Shah. I have no issues with that. If Gyanesh Kumar is vanishing votes, why will I stay quiet? If the voter's rights are snatched, I will snatch your rights.""""TMC MPs have been dragged mercilessly when they were protesting in Delhi. All the agencies have been grabbed. I challenge them that they came to power in Haryana and Bihar forcefully. In one more state, they come to power forcefully. Now they are trying to do this in Bengal. Who gets the coal scam's money? Amit Shah gets it. The money goes through Suvendu Adhikari. The money goes through BJP leader Jagannath Chattopadhyay to Suvendu Adhikari.

BJP Targets Mamata Banerjee Over ED Raid At I-PAC, Alleges Evidence Tampering

ED raids I-PAC-linked locations; Mamata alleges political vendetta

NEW DELHI: Several Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders, including MPs Mahua Moitra and Derek O’Brien, were detained by Delhi police on Friday while protesting outside Union home minister Amit Shah’s residence and office.The protest was staged against the Enforcement Directorate (ED) raids conducted at the office of the political consultancy firm I-PAC in Kolkata on Thursday.TMC MPs gathered with placards reading “Bengal rejects Modi-Shah’s dirty politics”, highlighting their opposition to the ED action, which they termed politically motivated and aimed at intimidating the party ahead of the West Bengal Assembly elections.Speaking to the media during the protest, Mahua Moitra said, “Yesterday, entire India, Bengal witnessed how ED was misused by the Home Ministry. The ED was sent to steal our party's political, strategic information. Mamata Banerjee is a lioness, she protected our party's properties.”TMC MP Kirti Azad added, “They are acting undemocratically; even the raid was illegal. They loot and accuse us of scams. They took away our strategy and candidate lists. BJP’s internal survey shows they won’t get more than 25 seats. But Mamata Banerjee will secure a massive mandate as CM and go on to become the Prime Minister.”The protest comes ahead of a planned march in Delhi led by West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee. Banerjee will lead the march from Jadavpur 8B Bus Stand to Hazra More at 2 pm to protest the ED raids, news agency PTI reported.The raids at I-PAC offices targeted two locations in Kolkata on Thursday. Apart from providing political consultancy to TMC, I-PAC manages the party’s IT and media operations, making the action sensitive for the party’s electoral preparations.Banerjee visited the I-PAC premises during the ongoing search, accusing the central agency of attempting to seize internal documents, hard disks, and digital data linked to the party’s election strategy.The TMC has described the ED action as politically motivated harassment, intensifying the standoff between the ruling party in West Bengal and the Union government ahead of the assembly elections.On Thursday, ED conducted searches at multiple locations, including the residence of I-PAC chief Pratik Jain.Reacting sharply to the raids, CM Banerjee accused the Centre of pursuing a political vendetta and misusing central agencies ahead of elections. She alleged that party documents, hard disks and sensitive data were being seized under the guise of an investigation.Questioning the role of the ED and Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Banerjee said, “Is it the duty of the ED, Amit Shah to collect the party's hard disk, candidate list?... The nasty, naughty Home Minister who cannot protect the country and is taking away all my party documents. What will be the result if I raid the BJP party office?”She also linked the agency action to the ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) exercise in West Bengal, alleging that voter names were being deleted ahead of the polls.“On one side, they are deleting the names of all the voters by carrying out the SIR in West Bengal...Because of the elections, they are collecting all the information about my party,” she said. Banerjee further dared the BJP to fight the TMC politically if it wanted to win Bengal.Banerjee visited I-PAC’s Salt Lake office during the searches, asserting that the Trinamool Congress is a registered political party that pays income tax and cannot be “bulldozed using money and muscle power”.The BJP hit back at the chief minister, accusing her of interfering in a central agency probe. Leader of the Opposition in the West Bengal Assembly Suvendu Adhikari termed Banerjee’s visit to Pratik Jain’s residence during the ED raid as “unconstitutional” and alleged it amounted to direct interference in the investigation.Adhikari further said the ED should take action against the chief minister, claiming her presence along with that of the Kolkata police commissioner, was improper while the search was underway.Officials said the ED raids were conducted at 15 locations in connection with a fake government job scam, allegedly run by an organised gang that duped people by promising employment.",Several Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders detained by Delhi police on Friday.

JAIPUR: One person died and at least 15 were injured when a speeding luxury car mowed down several people by the roadside near Kharbas Circle off Vande Matram Road in Mansarowar Friday night. Confirming the fatality, DCP (South) Rajarshi Raj Varma said the number of those injured in the accident could rise.Eyewitnesses said the red luxury car first rammed into Kharbas Circle and lost control before ploughing into food carts and shacks lining the road. People were having dinner and snacks at makeshift roadside eateries selling tea and other items when they were rammed into by the car.""The car came at very high speed, struck the circle, lost control and flew straight into people milling by the roadside. There was a huge hue and cry, with several people writhing in pain,"" said Vijay Choudhary, an eyewitness.Another eyewitness said the accident at around 9.20pm left people with no time to react, as the car bore down on them within seconds. ""Some were crushed under the wheels of the car, others were tossed to the other side of the road; it was complete mayhem,"" said another person.Eyewitnesses said the three people travelling in the car were pulled out and beaten up by members of the public.Muhana police station SHO Bhupendra Singh, one of the first officers to reach the spot, said the occupants of the luxury car had to be rescued from the angry crowd. ""People were scattered all over the place; the car must have been driven at very high speed,"" he said.The impact was so severe that steel cabins selling tea were twisted out of shape, with overturned carts and debris strewn across the road. Parts of the luxury car, broken pull-carts and food items were left scattered on the road.Police said the car appeared to be registered out of state in the name of a trust. Investigations remain ongoing.Incidentally, the first responders at the scene were three members of a special team of Jaipur police, who were in the area looking for a wanted suspect. In the melee that ensued after the crash, the suspect managed to flee, police said.","Luxury car ploughs into people by roadside in Mansarowar, Jaipur.

After 5th August 2019...’ Army Chief Counters Mehbooba’s Charge Against Centre Over J&K Situation

SRINAGAR: Former J&K chief minister and PDP Mehbooba Mufti on Friday described the National Medical Commission’s order withdrawing permission to Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Institute of Medical Excellence (SMVDIME) in Reasi to run an MBBS course as one with far-reaching consequences, warning that it could embolden “communal forces” across the country to exclude Kashmiri Muslim students from educational institutions.Mehbooba also questioned the role of J&K’s elected govt, stating that just hours before the NMC announced its decision, CM Omar Abdullah had publicly said the medical college should be shut. “Was there some understanding or discussion going on that whatever he said happened? The chief minister should have stood up against the decision to close the college,” she said, addressing a presser at PDP headquarters.She alleged that the decision was taken solely under pressure to remove Kashmiri Muslims from the medical institution. “The larger question is that Kashmiri Muslim students didn’t get space in their own state. If this is their fate in J&K, how will they be treated in other parts of the country?” she said.The NMC on Tuesday withdrew its Letter of Permission to start the MBBS course at SMVDIME with 50 seats for the 2025-26 academic year, citing major deficiencies in faculty strength, clinical material and infrastructure. It said students admitted during counselling would be accommodated in other govt medical colleges.Many political parties have questioned this, asking if the minimum standards were not met, how was the permission granted just four months ago, on Sept 8, 2025?Omar had on Thursday reacted strongly, saying people across the country fought to get medical colleges while those in Jammu were celebrating the shutting down of one after protests on religious lines. He said Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University, which was running SMVDIME, should be asked why the NMC withdrew permission. “Who is the chancellor of the university? You should ask him too,” he told reporters.The chancellor of the university is LG Manoj Sinha.The controversy erupted in Nov last year after 42 of the 50 seats went to Muslim students, mostly from Kashmir, while only seven Hindu students from Jammu made the list.This led to protests by the Jammu-based Shri MataVaishno Devi Sangharsh Samiti, an umbrella group of about 60 religious and civil society groups, which argued that an institution funded by Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board should give preference to Hindu students.BJP later backed the agitation, with party leaders making representations to LG Sinha, who heads the shrine board. They sought a review of the admission policy, arguing that “faith” should be the admission criteria in a college run on the donation of Hindus.","Mehbooba Mufti says decision could embolden 'communal forces' to exclude Kashmiri Muslim students from educational institutions.

It said that the attempts to dismiss such incidents as ""personal or political disputes"" only ""emboldened the perpetrators"".The remarks came as the reported cases of communal violence in December 2025 rose to 51, including 10 murders, according to Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council (BHBCUC).“We have repeatedly addressed this issue in earlier briefings and continue to see a disturbing pattern of recurring attacks on minorities, their homes, and businesses by extremists in Bangladesh,"" MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.""These communal incidents must be dealt with swiftly and firmly. Attempts to dismiss them as personal or political disputes only embolden perpetrators and deepen fear and insecurity among minorities,"" he added.Earlier this week, a 25-year-old Hindu man was killed in northwestern Bangladesh after leaping into a canal while fleeing a mob that had accused him of theft, marking the latest episode of violence against the minority community.Meanwhile, police detained former madrasa teacher Yasin Arafat, the main suspect in the murder of Hindu worker Dipu Chandra Das on December 18.Bangladesh’s Hindu community has faced a wave of attacks on minorities following the December killing of youth leader Sharif Osman Hadi.Among the victims was 40-year-old grocery shop owner Moni Chakraborty, who was hacked to death by unidentified assailants at Charsindhur Bazar in Palash Upazila on the night of January 5. The same day, Rana Pratap Bairagi, 38, an ice factory owner and acting editor of the Narail-based newspaper, was shot dead in the head by unknown attackers in Jessore district.In another incident, 50-year-old Khokon Chandra Das was viciously assaulted, hacked and set ablaze while returning home after shutting his shop on December 31.

Supreme Court Directs Dogs Be Shifted From Schools, Bus Stands To Shelters; Petitioner Breaks Down

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday continued hearing pleas seeking changes to its earlier order on stray dogs, with actor Sharmila Tagore appearing as one of the applicants through her counsel.The top court sharply pushed back against the submissions made on Tagore’s behalf, saying such arguments were “completely removed from reality.""Appearing for Tagore, counsel told the court that there cannot be a “one size fits all” solution when it comes to stray dogs on the streets. It said the issue must be looked at through science and psychology, adding that while the Animal Birth Control (ABC) rules may not be perfect, they need to be reviewed, not discarded.The counsel said the law already recognises a difference between normal street dogs and aggressive dogs and argued that some aggressive dogs can improve after treatment and behavioural care, though it accepted that aggression can return in some cases. Such dogs, he said, must be clearly identified by designated committees.When the Counsel cited example of a long-standing stray dog at AIIMS, the court said any dog living on the streets is likely to carry ticks and warned that allowing such animals inside hospitals could have “disastrous consequences”. The judges told the counsel not to romanticise the presence of dogs in sensitive public spaces.""Was she being taken to the hospital theatre also? Any dog that’s in the streets is bound to have ticks.And a dog with ticks in a hospital will have disastrous consequences. Do you understand? We’ll let you know the reality of what is being argued. You (the dog lover’s side) are completely removed from reality. Don’t try to glorify these dogs in the hospitals,"" the bench said.Suggestions like colour-coded collars to identify dogs with a history of biting were also raised by Tagore's counsel, citing examples from other countries. The court questioned the comparison and asked lawyers to remain realistic, pointing to differences in population size.The Supreme Court was hearing petitions seeking modification of its earlier directions in the stray dog matter.",Supreme Court on Friday continued hearing pleas seeking changes to its earlier order on stray dogs.

The unsung heroes of espionage,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-unsung-heroes-of-espionage/articleshow/126436503.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres. Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece. As Operation Absolute Resolve, which captured the Venezuelan President in a 30-minute manoeuvre, stunned, my thoughts turned to something else. Without well planted spies in Venezuela, this would have never been possible for the US. Spying is as ancient as the first kingdom that feared its neighbour. Egyptian scouts moved like wraiths through enemy camps. Sun Tzu, the 500 BCE philosopher, writes in his book ‘Art of War’, ‘Empires rise and fall on whispered intelligence. Whether the object is to crush an army, storm a city, or assassinate an individual, it is always necessary to begin by finding out the names of the aides-de-camp, servants, and doorkeepers through espionage.” Nearly 2000 years ago, Thiruvalluvar gazed into the heart of warfare and saw the same truth. In Kural 585, he captures the essence of the perfect spy in verses that shimmer with ancient wisdom: ""Kadaa Uruvodu Kannanjanjaadhu Yaandhum Ugaamai Valladhe Otru."" Of unsuspected disguise and all-unfearing eyes, who lets No secret out, are trusty spies. The sequences in the recent Bollywood spy movie Dhurandhar awakened a deep reverence for those valiant knights who work in darkness and shadows, unnamed and uncredited, who die without gun salutes or state honours. Saraswathy Rajamani was sixteen when fire entered her soul. Netaji's call to the Indian National Army rang through her privileged world, and with five other girls, she joined his army. They became spies in British households, dressed as boys, taking menial jobs that rendered them invisible. They served tea while empires schemed. And they listened. Every scrap of intelligence flowed back to INA headquarters. Each girl carried a gun and an instruction: if caught, end your life. When one was arrested but was unable to kill herself, Saraswathy walked into a military barracks as herself, a teenage girl. She drugged the officer on duty and vanished with her captured friend as police bullets tore into her legs. Not every tale is as dramatic. Kashmir Singh went to Pakistan on a mission that swallowed him whole. Caught by their intelligence service, he spent 35 years in their prisons—17 of them chained to a post in a lightless cell. Ravindra Kaushik achieved what intelligence agencies dream of—he became a deep cover agent planted within the Pakistani army itself. RAW trained him and sent him across the border where he rose through enemy ranks to the position of major. Until the mask slipped and he was caught, tortured and sentenced to death—erased as if he had never existed. There are legends that slip through the cracks of classified files too. Ajit Doval, now our National Security Advisor, once crossed into China to negotiate with the Mizoram Liberation Army chief. And then there is Sehmat. We don't know her real name. Perhaps we never will. Harinder Sikka's novel Calling Sehmat brought to life in the Bollywood movie Raazi , tells the tale of a 19-year-old girl asked by her dying father to become a bride and a weapon simultaneously. She married into a Pakistani military family, and during the 1971 war, passed intelligence so critical it saved INS Vikrant, the aircraft carrier, from destruction. But such salvation demands sacrifice measured in souls. She killed a servant who grew suspicious, and her brother-in-law who asked too many questions. She returned to India carrying her Pakistani husband's child—a son who would grow up to serve in the Indian Army. These are the invisible warriors Thiruvalluvar honoured. We may never know them. But we breathe free because they chose to suffocate in darkness.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’ Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.

MEA Calls For Firm Action As India Flags Disturbing Pattern Of Attacks On Minorities In Bangladesh

NEW DELHI: Slamming the Muhammad Yunus-led interim govt over the relentless attacks on minorities - including Hindus - and their properties in Bangladesh, and for watering down the incidents, India on Friday said attempts to whitewash the communal intent behind the crimes and attribute these to ""personal rivalries and political differences"" only ""emboldens the perpetrators"".Seven Hindu men have been killed in Bangladesh since Dec 18 - the day garment factory worker Dipu Chandra Das was lynched and his body hanged from a tree and set ablaze in Mymensingh, a killing that India described as ""horrendous"" and ""barbaric"". Of the seven, three, including a journalist, were killed this week.""We continue to witness a disturbing pattern of recurring attacks on minorities as well as their homes and businesses by extremists. Such communal incidents need to be dealt with swiftly and firmly,"" ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in his weekly briefing.The others killed in violence against Hindus were Amrit Mandal (Dec 24); factory security guard Bajendra Biswas (Dec 29); businessman Khokon Chandra Das (Dec 31); journalist Rana Pratap and businessman Moni Chakraborty (Monday); and Mithun Sarkar (Tuesday).In a briefing following the lynching of Mandal, who Dhaka said was a ""listed criminal"", Jaiswal on Dec 26 said over 2,900 incidents of violence against minorities, including cases of killings, arson, and land grab, had been documented by independent sources during the tenure of the interim govt and these incidents could not be brushed aside as mere media exaggeration or dismissed as political violence.The Yunus-led administration has repeatedly dismissed India's concerns as propaganda by Indian media.The internal situation deteriorated in Bangladesh after the death of radical leader and India-baiter Sharif Osman Hadi on Dec 18, a prominent face of the 2024 anti-govt protests that led to then PM Sheikh Hasina abdicating and fleeing to India.","Seven Hindu men have been killed in Bangladesh since Dec 18 - the day garment factory worker Dipu Chandra Das was lynched.

BJP Targets Mamata Banerjee Over ED Raid At I-PAC, Alleges Evidence Tampering

KOLKATA: A day after high drama and tense standoff as CM Mamata Banerjee walked into its office challenging the ongoing ED raid, the 450-odd employees of I-PAC office in Kolkata returned to work on Friday, in 100% attendance.There were some ""visible changes"", though, right outside its office on the 11th floor at Godrej Waterside in Sector V, the most crucial one being the added police post on the 11th floor.

It was then decided that the staff would be asked to report back to the office from Friday to ""restore normal work"" as quickly as possible.""There was an apprehension that ED would seal our office premises.

Mamata Banerjee Hits Streets, Leads Kolkata Rally Against ED Raids

KOLKATA: Alleging violation of 'right to privacy', TMC, in its petition against ED before Calcutta HC, said the search and seizure at the office of its political strategist I-PAC and the residence of the firm's director came after party chief Mamata Banerjee threatened to go to Supreme Court against the chaotic implementation of SIR process, report Subrata Chattoraj and Srishti Lakhotia.The petition stated under the pretext of investigation, ED ""unlawfully"" gained access to and control over TMC's electoral roll management, campaign planning, and political strategy, with the intent to disrupt election process.""The entire action is out of political vendetta and to scuttle the democratic process of free and fair upcoming elections,"" it stated.The party sought a direction to ED to return ""confidential and sensitive"" documents seized during the searches, which, according to it, included ""political documents relating to campaign strategy, internal assessments, research inputs, organisational coordination, and electoral roll-related data used for electioneering purposes"" in the forthcoming Bengal assembly polls.It claimed that these materials had no ""nexus"" with any scheduled offence or alleged proceeds of crime, and did not fall within the scope of the probe under PMLA. ""Such targeted seizure amounts to an impermissible intrusion into TMC's right to privacy under Article 21 and its constitutional right to participate meaningfully in the democratic process under Article 19.""The petition stated I-PAC, a professional political consulting organisation that provides strategic, research, communications and on-ground campaign support to political parties and their members across India, has been associated with TMC for 6 years, providing end-to-end campaign support. It is ""intrinsically"" linked with the party in maintaining ""crucial, private, confidential and sensitive data"", including that of the upcoming election, it said.ED's action, TMC said, was in ""transgression of its powers and authority"" under PMLA.

NEW DELHI: Indian military retaliation against the terror attack in Pahalgam led Pakistan to frantically seek US mediation to make New Delhi pause the strikes deep inside its territory.Disclosures from US FARA (Foreign Agents Registration Act) filings reveal that between May 7, when IAF struck headquarters of JeM, LeT and Hizbul Mujahideen, and May 10, when Pakistan director general of military operations Major General Kashif Abdullah rang up his Indian counterpart Lt General Rajiv Ghai, Islamabad had launched an urgent lobbying campaign in Washington. Pakistani diplomats, including its ambassador and defence attache, initiated over 60 points of contact - comprising meetings, calls and emails - with high-ranking US officials and media outlets to solicit international intervention. The details are part of the filings by Squire Patton Boggs, hired by Pakistan for lobbying and which, like other US lobbying firms, are mandated to share with the US Department of Justice, the details and nature of their dealings.A majority of meetings were sought between the onset of Operation Sindoor and the eventual suspension of India's military operations with requests to secure American mediation to ""somehow halt"" India's retaliatory military operations.While Pakistan tried to dismiss the impact of India's strikes, the records confirm a high-level of behind-the-scenes panic.Pakistan had hired lobbying firm Squire Patton Boggs originally to help it steer away from FATF grey list.

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh's interim government on Thursday announced that it has asked its key diplomatic missions in India, including the High Commission in New Delhi, to temporarily suspend visa services citing ""security concerns"".""What I have done is that I have asked our three missions (in India) to keep their visa sections closed for the time being. It's a security issue,"" Foreign affairs adviser M Touhid Hossain told reporters at a media briefing.The remarks came after Bangladesh's Deputy High Commission in Kolkata overnight restricted visa services, following similar steps taken earlier in New Delhi and Agartala.However, business and work visas have been kept outside the scope of the restrictions. Bangladesh also has diplomatic missions in Mumbai and Chennai, where visa services continue to operate normally.Hossain also said Bangladesh has approached the United States seeking a reversal of a recently imposed visa bond requirement. Dhaka will pursue diplomatic channels to seek an exemption, calling the move ""certainly unfortunate and painful for us,"" PTI reported.At the same time, he noted that the US decision was ""not abnormal"", as it was not applied only to Bangladesh and several other countries were facing similar immigration-related measures.Ties between Dhaka and New Delhi have remained strained since the Awami League government led by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted in violent, student-led protests in July–August 2024.Relations have since hit another roadblock following the killing of youth leader Sharif Osman Hadi in Dhaka, which triggered anti-India protests. Hadi, a prominent figure in last year's July uprising, was killed amid rising political tensions, sparking widespread unrest.Protests also broke out after the killing of Dipu Chandra Das, a young Hindu factory worker who was lynched in Mymensingh after being falsely accused of religious defamation.Hindu religious organisations and minority rights groups held a protest outside the National Press Club in Dhaka on Monday, describing the incident as part of a wider pattern of religious extremism, attacks on minorities and official inaction.India too raised concerns over the safety of minorities, the security of diplomatic missions and what it calls ""misleading narratives"" emerging from Bangladesh. New Delhi further urged Dhaka to bring those responsible for the lynching of Dipu Chandra Das to justice and said it remained ""vigilant about the safety of minorities.""From exile in India, Sheikh Hasina blamed interim chief adviser Muhammad Yunus for Bangladesh's instability, accusing the interim government of empowering extremists, failing to protect minorities and undermining ties with India.","Bangladesh has asked its key diplomatic missions in India to temporarily suspend visa services.

NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday accused the Centre of holding political vendetta, alleging that central agencies were being misused ahead of elections, after the Enforcement Directorate carried out searches at various locations, including the residence of IPAC chief Pratik Jain.Reacting sharply to the action, Banerjee questioned the role of the ED and Union home minister Amit Shah .

Court grants Antonio Brown permission to travel to Tampa amid ongoing Miami shooting case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/court-grants-antonio-brown-permission-to-travel-to-tampa-amid-ongoing-miami-shooting-case/articleshow/126441976.cms,"Antonio Brown receives court approval to travel (Image via: Getty Images)

Antonio Brown granted travel permission as Miami shooting case unfolds



Former NFL wide receiver Antonio Brown returned to court Friday as his high-profile Miami shooting case continues to draw attention across the sports and legal world. The hearing centered on a motion seeking permission for Brown to travel outside Miami-Dade County while awaiting further proceedings, a request that faced opposition from state prosecutors.The case stems from an alleged shooting after a celebrity boxing event last year and marks another difficult moment in Brown’s life since leaving the NFL. With recent court decisions, newly released body camera footage, and a self-defense claim still under review, the case is ongoing and drawing close attention.A Miami judge ruled in favor of Antonio Brown’s request to travel and temporarily reside in Tampa, despite objections from the state. Prosecutors argued Brown posed a flight risk, citing his prior international travel, including a trip to Dubai. Judge Marisa Tinkler Mendez ultimately allowed the move, ordering Brown’s GPS monitor removed for the duration of his stay in Tampa and reinstalled upon his return to Miami-Dade County.Court filings state that Brown plans to attend scheduled business engagements with Energetic Exotic, a luxury and exotic car rental company, along with prearranged music studio sessions.The motion also noted that Brown would stay at his primary private residence while in Tampa.The legal proceedings stem from a May 16 incident in which Brown is accused of firing two gunshots at Zul-Qarnain Kwame Nantambu following a physical altercation outside a celebrity boxing match in Miami. According to investigators, one bullet allegedly grazed Nantambu’s neck. Brown has pleaded not guilty to attempted second-degree murder, a charge that carries a potential sentence of up to 15 years in prison and a $10,000 fine if convicted.Recently released police body camera footage shows Brown handcuffed in a Miami Police cruiser, questioning officers about his detention and complaining of injuries. In the video, Brown repeatedly insists he did nothing wrong and asks to contact his mother while requesting medical attention for cuts on his knee.Brown’s defense has taken an aggressive stance, filing a motion to dismiss the charges under Florida’s “Stand Your Ground” law. His attorneys argue that Brown acted in self-defense, claiming Nantambu had a history of threatening behavior and previously assaulted Brown at other events. The motion alleges Brown fired warning shots, intentionally aiming away, after fearing for his life during the confrontation.Brown maintains that he remained at the scene and cooperated with police, while Nantambu allegedly fled with the firearm. Authorities did not immediately arrest Brown that night, with charges filed days later after Nantambu gave a full statement. As the case moves forward, the ruling allows Brown limited freedom while the court weighs the broader legal questions ahead.","Antonio Brown granted travel permission as Miami shooting case unfolds.

BHOPAL: As fears and concerns around water contamination rise among citizens in the nation, an old and neglected fault-line in Bhopal emerged when the civic body (BMC) arrived at a gasaffected colony on Friday to cut ‘illegal’ water connections here. The residents said they cannot afford Rs 10,000 connections and if the connections are cut, they would be forced to drink ‘poisonous’ groundwater.Residents of Brij Vihar Colony in Nishatpura locality, a gas-affected area, objected as a BMC team arrived there early in the morning to cut ‘illegal’ water connections. There are around 70 households in the colony and they are drawing water from Narmada pipeline which runs across the place.Mayank Pal, one of the residents in the colony, said that their colony is one of the 42 colonies where the Supreme Court had ordered free water supply as the groundwater in the area near the Carbide plant is contaminated.“However, the BMC is asking for Rs 10,000 to provide us connection as it’s a private colony. We can give the BMC monthly water cess ofRs 280 or whatever it is but giving Rs 10,000 for connection is not possible.”he added.Activist Rachna Dhingra, who also took up the issue with BMC officials said the residents of the colony are entitled to free water supply and when the issue of colony not getting tap water was raised with the Monitoring Committee appointed by the apex court, they had arranged for a tank to be placed in the colony.“But it’s difficult to fetch water from the tank, so people have taken connection from the Narmada pipelinerunning across the colony”, she added.The BMC team cut the connections but restored it later in the morning as the residents said they would be constrained to drink ‘poisonous’ groundwater if the connections are cut. BMC additional commissioner Tanmay Sharma, who was also there at the spot, said, “The colony has come up years after the gas tragedy took place. We can still consider giving them connection, but drawing water through illegal connection is not proper in any case. ”","Residents of Brij Vihar Colony in Nishatpura locality objected as a BMC team arrived there early in the morning to cut ‘illegal’ water connections.

Who was Renee Good?





A new video showing the final moments of Renee Nicole Good who was shot dead by a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent in Minneapolis, has surfaced online. The footage has intensified debate over the incident and the use of force by federal agents.The footage showed ICE agent perspective and sheded light on how things unfolded. filmed from inside Good’s car, captures her speaking calmly to an ICE officer moments before gunshots were heard.Sitting in the driver’s seat, Good is heard saying, “That’s fine, dude, I’m not mad at you,” as the officer repeatedly asked her to get out of the vehicle. Seconds later, gunshots were fired.Also Read | ICE shooting in Minneapolis: Woman killed by officer, DHS says it was an act of self-defense The footage adds a new perspective to the incident, as earlier videos circulating online were recorded from the officer’s point of view.The newly surfaced video has triggered strong reactions on social media. Several viewers said the footage reinforced their belief that Good posed no threat at the time of the shooting.One user wrote: ""She was never trying to harm anyone. She was simply trying to escape. Anyone with a functioning brain cell can see that.""Another commented: ""She was absolutely no threat. This is just flat out murder.""It's not confirmed whether the video was taken by ICE agent Jonathan Ross who opened fire at Renee Good or whether it was taken by another agent.The earlier video offered a different angle of what unfolded in Minneapolis. The clip captured the point of view of the ICE agent, whom the Trump administration said acted in self-defense.In the footage, Renee Good and her partner Rebecca Good were seen interacting with the ICE agent during a tense exchange.Renee, who was in the driver’s seat, appeared calm, while Rebecca was heard speaking to the officer and questioning his actions.The video showed the officer repeatedly asking Renee to get out of the car. At one point, Rebecca told Renee to “drive, baby, drive,” after an altercation occurred between them and the agent.The footage then became chaotic, with the camera angle shifting as the ICE agent fell to the ground, followed by gunshots.US vice-president sharing the video in a post on X write, ""Watch this, as hard as it is. Many of you have been told this law enforcement officer wasn't hit by a car, wasn't being harassed, and murdered an innocent woman. The reality is that his life was endangered and he fired in self defense.""Supporters of President Donald Trump and conservative commentators have argued that the video shows the ICE agent being struck by the vehicle before he fired, claiming the shooting was an act of self-defence.Some have also criticised Rebecca Good, accusing her of provoking the situation.Democrats and civil rights advocates, however, say the footage does not show Renee Good attacking the officer. They point to her calm tone and her attempt to drive away as evidence that she was trying to leave the scene, not harm anyone.Several witnesses have also said they did not see Good’s car hit an officer before shots were fired.The US Department of Homeland Security defended the shooting, saying ICE officers were conducting targeted operations when protesters allegedly blocked them.DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said an officer fired “defensive shots” after a vehicle was used as a weapon, describing the act as “domestic terrorism.”President Trump also defended the agent, telling reporters he did not want to see anyone shot but claimed the woman had run over an officer. “She behaved horribly… she ran him over,” Trump said, adding that the situation was “vicious.” After viewing surveillance footage, he described it as “a terrible scene” and said he hated watching it.Also Read | ‘Behaved horribly’: Donald Trump defends ICE agent after Minneapolis shooting; claims 'she ran him over Local leaders disputed the federal account.

BJP state president Ravindra Chavan and party MLA Kishan Kathore had made strong efforts to dislodge the Sena from office in these elections.While BJP succeeded in winning the council president’s post with its candidate Tejashri Karanjule coming on top, the party could get only 15 councillors.On the other hand, though the Sena’s candidate for president lost, the party emerged as the single largest by winning 27 seats.To maintain control of the civic body, the BJP brought together 12 Congress councillors, four from NCP, and one independent, forming a 32-member alliance named the Ambernath Vikas Aghadi. The group was formally registered with the Thane collector, and BJP councillor Abhijit Karanjule was appointed as group leader. However, BJP faced criticism for aligning with Congress, which suspended its councillors, leading all 12 to formally join BJP.","A day after 12 suspended Congress councillors joined BJP, all four councillors from NCP withdrew support to the BJP-led front.

‘ICE Cold Killers’ signs as outrage spreads





A fatal shooting by an ICE officer in south Minneapolis has triggered outrage far beyond Minnesota, with large protests breaking out in New York City and demonstrators openly condemning Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.The woman who was killed has been identified by city officials as 37-year-old Renee Nicole Macklin Good, a US citizen who had moved to the Twin Cities from the Kansas City area. Officials said Good was acting as a legal observer of federal activity and was not the target of any ICE arrest.The shooting happened Wednesday morning at East 34th Street and Portland Avenue, just blocks from where George Floyd was murdered by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020, a killing that sparked weeks of protests across the US and around the world.According to the Department of Homeland Security, the ICE agent’s actions were justified. Federal officials described the woman’s actions before the shooting as an “act of domestic terrorism.” Local officials, however, say video recorded by witnesses contradicts that account and have called for ICE to leave the city.The incident occurred as DHS flooded the area with more than 2,000 officers as part of what it described as one of its largest immigration enforcement operations so far, under the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.The Minneapolis shooting quickly set off protests nationwide. In New York City, demonstrators gathered at Foley Square early Wednesday before marching to One World Trade Center, where Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was speaking about ongoing ICE operations, according to local media reports.By Thursday night, the crowd at Foley Square had grown larger than the night before, with heightened tensions bringing out more protesters, and a heavier police presence, both in the square and across the street at 26 Federal Plaza.Earlier in the day, around 200 protesters marched from Foley Square to 1 World Trade Center in an attempt to confront Noem directly. As she defended the actions of the ICE agent who shot Good, demonstrators in downtown Manhattan chanted “Killer Kristi!”“Go to hell, Kristi Noem!” protesters yelled.In New York, a crowd of roughly 300 people carried signs reading “ICE Cold Killers” and “ICE is Trump’s Gestapo.” The demonstrations were part of a broader wave of protests condemning ICE operations and the federal government’s handling of the shooting.Local officials in Minneapolis have continued to push back against the federal government’s account, saying eyewitness video undermines DHS claims and demanding answers, and accountability, for Good’s death.","A fatal shooting by an ICE officer in Minneapolis has triggered outrage far beyond Minnesota.

Why does it matter?





Renee Good, a 37-year-old poet and mother was fatally killed by an ICE officer on January 7, 2026. The Minneapolis woman was driving an SUV when she was confronted by the agency's officials and was shot through her car window by one officer. The video of the brutal incident went viral on the internet, exposing the reality of the Trump administration's Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, leading to protests and calls for ICE to leave the city.A video of a woman attending a memorial for Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis on Thursday, has gone viral on X. ""It feels kind of wrong being here, in some way,"" she began. ""I don’t know where that stems from. Part of it is being a White woman. I am privileged. I have a lot of privilege. So I feel like my tears are not something that's necessary when black and brown people have been experiencing this. For a long time. This isn't new for them. I don’t know if that makes any sense,"" she told journalist Brecca Stoll of The Daily Wire, a conservative-leaning outlet, when asked why she feels wrong for showing up at the memorial.When asked about how she decided to show up for the memorial, she said: ""Well, I work two miles from here.So, driving by, two miles, I can stop.""The video was posted on the social media app by @Breaking911 and has received 5.4M views and 26K likes as of now. It sparked a debate in the comments section, reflecting various views on race in the United States at a time when immigrants are being targeted by the Trump administration.“If you have a person who thinks like this in your life please do what you can to help free them from their identitarian anxieties. White people should grieve and cry. You should not racialise your tears as a general matter,” wrote Tim Miller, former Republican strategist, on X.“Woke ideology has sent people literally bonkers,” wrote journalist Piers Morgan.""This is honestly more disrespectful than me just saying I don't care,"" wrote an X user.""Leftism, the ideology where you can literally give your life for the cause and still be derided for being white,"" added another.""America wasn't THIS racist since after Obama and before the Civil Rights movement,"" one pointed out.""EVEN GRIEF IS RADICALISEDThis is where the left has landed in 2026 A woman shows up to pay her respects to Renee Good — and instead of acting like a normal human being, she spirals into racial self-flagellation,"" added one.The fatal and shocking shooting of Good has sent America into a spiral.

On the other hand, extremists are justifying the act by blaming the Good herself for her untimely death.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has alleged that she sought to weaponise her vehicle against the ICE officer and that he feared for his life. However, critics have pointed out that the video footage of the shooting showed that Good was attempting to drive away and escape the situation and that the shooting was unnecessary.As the investigation has been taken over by the FBI, ICE continues to face large opposition from protestors across the states who have been privy to the agency's atrocities and shootings for a year now.","Renee Good, a 37-year-old poet and mother was fatally killed by an ICE officer on January 7, 2026.

‘Will Shoot First, Ask Later’: NATO Troops ‘Ready For War’ If Trump Orders Greenland Invasion |Watch

Europe scrambles to push back

'$10,000 to $100,000 per person'





Denmark has warned that its troops are under standing orders to ""shoot first and ask questions later"" if Greenland comes under attack, as anxiety grows in Europe over the United States under President Donald Trump openly weighing military action to seize the Arctic territory.The country's defence ministry said a Cold War-era rule obliges soldiers to respond immediately to any foreign invasion without waiting for political clearance or formal orders. Speaking to Danish newspaper Berlingske, the ministry said the directive requires forces to ""immediately take up the fight"" if attacked and remains fully in force.The rule, introduced in 1952, states that in the event of an invasion, troops must act “without waiting for or seeking orders, even if the commanders in question are not aware of the declaration of war or state of war”. Danish officials said the provision applies regardless of who the invading force may be.The warning comes as European leaders struggle to frame a response to repeated statements by Trump, who has refused to rule out the use of force to annex Greenland. The White House has said Trump is still considering all options, heightening unease among Denmark’s allies.European governments have rallied behind Copenhagen, with calls for a coordinated response to any US move against Greenland.French foreign minister Jean-Noel Barrot said he would discuss the issue with his German and Polish counterparts, emphasising the need for collective action.“We want to take action, but we want to do so together with our European partners,” Barrot told France Inter radio.He added that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio had “discarded” the idea that Greenland could face an intervention similar to the recent US assault on Venezuela aimed at ousting President Nicolas Maduro. Despite those assurances, Denmark’s reaffirmation of its shoot-first doctrine underscores how seriously it is preparing for the possibility of escalation.The Trump administration is considering a plan to offer direct cash payments to Greenlanders in an effort to persuade them to break away from Denmark and move closer to the United States, according to multiple sources cited by news agency Reuters.US officials have talked internally about offering lump sum payments of between $10,000 and $100,000 per person to residents of Greenland. The island nation is currently a semi-autonomous Danish territory with a population of about 57,000 and has an abundance of useful natural resources. The idea remains at a preliminary stage and details are still unclear. Aides have discussed figures that could amount to nearly $6 billion in total, sources said.Another option being discussed is a Compact of Free Association, an agreement the US already has with some Pacific island nations. Under such deals, the US provides financial aid and defence protection in return for military access. Greenland would likely have to become independent from Denmark first, and payments could be used to encourage public support for that step or for a future agreement.Polls show most Greenlanders favour independence from Denmark, but surveys also indicate they do not want to become part of the United States.",Denmark warns troops to'shoot first and ask questions later' if Greenland comes under attack.

Katie Miller, wife of White House aide Stephen Miller, criticised Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez after AOC claimed that Fox News host Jesse Watters made a sexual joke about Stephen.The confrontation involved a Fox News producer who approached AOC and asked her to appear on Watters’ primetime newscast. AOC declined and said: “He has sexualized me on his show. He has sexually harassed me on his show. He has engaged in horrific, sexually exploitative rhetoric,” she said before walking away.AOC referred to a remark Watters made in October about her allegedly wanting to “sleep with Stephen Miller.” At the time, Watters, co-host of The Five, told co-host Dana Perino: “No, I think AOC wants to sleep with Miller. It is so obvious. I’m sorry, you can’t have him. Miller is the best. I know him well socially, and the man is not overcompensating.”The incident follows an Instagram video in which AOC joked that Miller “looks like he’s, like, 4′10” in reference to MAGA’s “insecure masculinity.” Miller later clarified during an interview on The Ingraham Angle that he is 5’10” and called AOC a “trainwreck” and “a walking nightmare.”Reacting to the latest remarks on social media, Katie Miller reposted a video of the exchange with AOC and asked, “Why you so obsessed with my husband?”AOC also addressed the issue on X and said: “You can either be a pervert or ask me to be on your little show.

‘Won’t Tolerate Imperialist…’: Mexico, Cuba Cross Swords With US Over ‘Illegal Venezuela Rule’

Berlingske





After, Venezuelan military op and threatening Greenland and Columbia, US President Donald Trump now seems to turn his attention to Mexico, to target drug cartels, following maritime attacks in the eastern Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea.“We are going to start now hitting land with regard to the cartels. The cartels are running Mexico,” said Trump in an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity aired on Thursday night, signalling a tougher stance on cross-border cartel operations.Any direct action against cartels inside Mexico, however, would represent a major escalation of US military involvement in the region. Trump said on Sunday that he was pressing Sheinbaum to allow US troops to operate in Mexico against drug cartels, an offer he claimed she had previously rejected.then, Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum warned on Monday that the Americas “do not belong” to any single power, responding to Trump’s comments about Washington’s “dominance” of the hemisphere following Maduro’s capture.Trump’s remarks comes after the surprise capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro last weekend, the climax of months of sustained US military and economic pressure on the leftist regime.US had been carrying out strikes on suspected drug-trafficking vessels since September, killing more than 100 people. Trump has also said US forces conducted a land strike on a Venezuelan docking facility used by such boats. Caracas’ left-wing interim government has condemned the US strikes as a threat to regional stability.Trump also said that he plans to ""buy"" Greenland, following Denmark President gave a sharp reaction. Denmark warned that its troops are under standing orders to “shoot first and ask questions later” if Greenland comes under attack, amid rising European unease over the United States under President Donald Trump openly weighing military action to seize the Arctic territory.Denmark’s defence ministry said a Cold War-era directive requires soldiers to respond instantly to any foreign invasion, without waiting for political clearance or formal orders. Speaking to Danish daily, the ministry said the rule obliges forces to “immediately take up the fight” if attacked and remains fully in force.","US President Donald Trump says he will target drug cartels in Mexico.

Can Barron Trump marry Denmark’s Princess and secure Greenland as dowry? MAGA calls it 'diplomatic solution',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/can-barron-trump-marry-denmarks-princess-and-secure-greenland-as-dowry-maga-calls-it-diplomatic-solution/articleshow/126415278.cms,"Melania Trump Accused of THREATENING Mar-a-Lago Members After Models LEAK Barron's Pics





A somewhat orthodox idea running through the MAGA side of social media claims to have solved one of Donald Trump’s most controversial foreign policy obsessions.The so-called diplomatic solution suggests that Donald's son, Barron Trump, could marry Denmark’s Princess Isabella and secure Greenland for the United States as a dowry gift.The bizarre theory has gone viral after Trump once again revived his long-standing ambition to take control of Greenland, and potentially make it the 51st state that the US prez always wanted. The GOP government has described the Arctic territory as of strategic importance to US security.Supporters online now claim that a royal marriage between Trump’s youngest son, Barron, 19, and Princess Isabella, 18, would solve the problem.One user wrote on X: “The simple diplomatic solution is Barron Trump marries Princess Isabella of Denmark and Greenland is given to America as dowry payment”. The post attracted millions of interactions and AI-generated images of the imagined couple.There is no basis in law, diplomacy or royal protocol for such a claim, but it has gained traction at a time when Trump’s is considering different ways of acquiring Greenland, be it through diplomacy, by force, or just ""buying it.""Greenland is part of the Kingdom of Denmark but is a self-governing territory rather than part of Denmark proper, with its own government and parliament controlling most domestic affairs.Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen is not very happy with the MAGA chief thinking Greenland is available for the taking.Frederiksen told public broadcaster DR: “Unfortunately, I think the American president should be taken seriously when he says he wants Greenland.""Greenland does not want to be a part of the US: “I have made it very clear where the Kingdom of Denmark stands, and Greenland has repeatedly said that it does not want to be part of the United States.”She added: “If the United States attacks another NATO country, everything stops.”Greenland is an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark and is not a monarchy in its own right. Princess Isabella has no constitutional role over Greenland. Hence, the idea of a dowry transfer is legally meaningless.Nevertheless, Trump’s interest in Greenland is real.The island has a population of about 58,000 and no independent military. Denmark is responsible for its defence but has limited resources to cover such a vast area.Another option floated by Trump allies is buying Greenland, an idea previously raised by President Harry Truman back in 1946. Both Copenhagen and Nuuk have repeatedly said the territory is not for sale. Any purchase would require congressional approval, Senate backing and likely EU consent.A softer approach could involve influence campaigns aimed at encouraging Greenlandic independence, followed by a close partnership with Washington. However, many Greenlanders favour independence from Denmark; they do not want to become part of the US.","Theory suggests that Donald's son, Barron Trump, could marry Denmark’s Princess Isabella and secure Greenland for the United States as a dowry gift.

Another Trump STRIKE! Fifth Oil Tanker With Venezuelan Oil ‘CAPTURED’; Russia Watches Closely





US President Donald Trump wore a small lapel pin showing a cartoon image of himself during a meeting with top oil executives at the White House on Friday.The pin, placed just below the traditional American flag pin on his suit, was noticed by reporters during a question-and-answer session. When asked about it, Trump said it was called a “Happy Trump”.“Somebody gave me this,” Trump told reporters. “Considering the fact that I’m never happy, I’m never satisfied. I will never be satisfied until we make America great again. But we’re getting pretty close.”The moment quickly drew attention online, with social media users sharing images and comments about the pin, which shows Trump with an exaggerated facial expression.The exchange happened during a meeting where Trump and members of his Cabinet met nearly two dozen representatives from some of the world’s largest oil companies. The discussions focused on future plans related to Venezuela’s oil production and possible US involvement and investments in the country’s energy sector.This was not the first time Trump has worn the same pin. He had worn it earlier during a February ceremony to swear in Tulsi Gabbard as director of National Intelligence, though he did not comment on it at the time.According to online listings, a pin with a similar Trump design is available for sale online.US presidents have traditionally worn American flag lapel pins since the September 11, 2001, attacks. Trump continued that practice, with the “Happy Trump” pin added alongside it during Friday’s meeting.","US President Donald Trump wore a small lapel pin showing a cartoon image of himself during a meeting with top oil executives at the White House on Friday.

Trump 'FEARS' Putin & Xi; Announces Greenland Takeover 'Easy Or Hard Way' To Keep Russia, China Away





US President Donald Trump late Friday once again spoke about taking action on Greenland, saying the US would have to do “something” or risk Russia and China stepping in. He said Washington does not want Moscow or Beijing as its “neighbours”.Speaking to reporters during a meeting with top oil and gas executives, Trump questioned Denmark’s claim over Greenland, saying that landing a boat there 500 years ago does not give ownership of the land.When asked about Greenland, Trump said, ""We are going to do something on Greenland, whether they like it or not, because if we don't do it, Russia or China will take over Greenland -- and we're not going to have Russia or China as a neighbour. I would like to make a deal the easy way but if we don't do it the easy way, we're going to do it the hard way"".He added, ""And by the way, I'm a fan of Denmark as well. They've been very nice to me. I'm a big fan but the fact that they had a boat land there 500 years ago doesn't mean that they own the land. We had lots of boats go there also. But we need that because if you take a look at outside of Greenland right now, they are Russian destroyers, Chinese destroyers and bigger there are Russian submarines all over the place.We're not going to have Russia or China occupy Greenland and that's what they're going to do if we don't. We will do something with Greenland either the nice way or the difficult way.""When questioned about why the US needed to “own” Greenland when it already has a military presence there, Trump said ownership was essential for defence.He said, ""When we own it we defend it. You don't defend leases the same way. You have to own it. Countries have to have ownership and you defend ownership. You don't defend leases. If we don't do it, China or Russia well. That's not going to happen... Nato has to understand that. I'm all for Nato. I saved it. If it weren't for me, Nato would not be there.""Trump’s repeated comments on Greenland have drawn strong pushback from Denmark and Greenland. Copenhagen has warned that its troops are under orders to “shoot first and ask question later” if Greenland comes under attack, as concerns grow in Europe over the US openly discussing possible military action against the Arctic territory.Earlier, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen rejected Trump’s claims that the US “needs” Greenland for security reasons, calling them an “unacceptable pleasure”.When asked what it would mean if the US used force against another Nato member, Frederiksen said, ""If the US attacks another Nato country, everything stops."" She added that while she could not predict Washington’s actions, ""there is full support from Europe that borders must be respected.""Trump has renewed his push to take over Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory rich in natural resources such as rare earth minerals, uranium and iron. His latest remarks come days after the US used military force in Venezuela to seize President Nicolas Maduro.For decades, the US has viewed Greenland as strategically important. Under Trump, the island has again been placed at the centre of Washington’s Arctic strategy. Trump had earlier offered to buy Greenland in 2019 during his first term, but Denmark said it was not for sale.Trump has repeatedly warned that Russia and China could take control of foreign territories if the US does not act. Referring to the Venezuela operation, he said, ""If we didn't do what we did, China or Russia would have been in Venezuela.""In response to a question about Europe, Trump sharply criticised wind energy. He said, ""I'm not much of a windmill person. I can proudly say that we have not approved one wind mill since I've been in office and we're going to keep it that way. My role is to not let any windmill get build. They're losers. They lose money, they destroy your landscape, they kill your birds, they are all made in China"".He also suggested that Europe should question China about its own use of wind power.Trump said, ""They (China) use coal, oil and gas and some nuclear but they don't have windmills. They make them and sell them to suckers like Europe and suckers like the United States before. They are the worst form of energy, most expensive form of energy"".These remarks came shortly after Trump signed a memorandum directing the US to withdraw from international organisations, conventions and treaties that he said were “contrary to the interests” of the US.According to a White House statement, the move includes withdrawal from 35 non-UN organisations and 31 UN entities. Among the non-UN organisations listed are the India- and France-led International Solar Alliance, environmental bodies such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.Other organisations affected include the International Energy Forum, the International Renewable Energy Agency, the Partnership for Atlantic Cooperation and the Global Counterterrorism Forum.","US President Donald Trump said the US would have to do ‘something’ or risk Russia and China stepping in.

Donald Trump Tells Netanyahu He Stopped India-Pakistan War The 70th Time Since Op Sindoor Paused





During a White House meeting with US oil industry leaders on Saturday, President Donald Trump reiterated sweeping assertions about his foreign policy record, including his long-repeated claim that he single-handedly prevented a major war between India and Pakistan.Trump tied this and several other conflict de-escalation claims to his belief that he deserves a Nobel Peace Prize for his global peacemaking efforts.""I settled 8 wars... Some of them, which were just getting ready to start, like India and Pakistan, where already 8 jets were shot down... I got it done in rapid order, without nuclear weapons. I can't think of anybody in history who should get the Nobel Peace Prize other than me; nobody else settled wars,” said Trump.“President Putin called me, and mentioned about 2 of the wars he had been wanting to stop for 10 years... Pakistan's Prime Minister came here and made a public statement saying President Trump saved 10 million lives involving Pakistan and India, and that was going to be raging,” he added.Pressed by a reporter about Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, who won the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize and dedicated it in part to Trump for US actions against the Maduro regime, Trump said he had not yet spoken with her but would do so and “might be involved in some aspect” of future efforts.In a previous interview with Fox News, Trump had described the India-Pakistan crisis as one of “eight and a quarter” wars he claimed to have ended, insisting his actions, including warnings about trade and tariffs, prevented a serious escalation. He said, “India-Pakistan was ready to go at it big … and I got that one stopped.”India has consistently rejected claims of US mediation in the May 2025 ceasefire, stating bilateral military-to-military talks led to the halt in hostilities without outside intervention. Foreign policy analysts also note that while Trump has supported ceasefires in several conflicts, his characterization of them as “ended wars” and a basis for Nobel consideration is widely disputed.","President Donald Trump said he stopped a looming war between India and Pakistan without nuclear weapons.

‘Won’t Stay Silent’: Macron Issues Big Warning To US As Trump Mulls Greenland Invasion





President Donald Trump warned that the United States will take action on Greenland, saying it will act “the easy way” or “the hard way” to prevent Russia or China from gaining influence on the Arctic island.Addressing a gathering on Saturday at the White House, Trump said, ""We are going to do something on Greenland, whether they like it or not, because if we don't do it, Russia or China will take over Greenland, and we're not going to have Russia or China as a neighbour. I would like to make a deal the easy way, but if not, we are going to do it the hard way.”Emphasising the strategic importance of the island, he said, “When we own it, we defend it... Look at what happened with the horrible deal Obama made with Iran, which was a short-term deal... Countries need to have ownership... We have to defend Greenland, because if we don't, China or Russia will.”The Trump administration is reportedly considering offering direct cash payments to Greenlanders to encourage closer ties with the United States. Sources cited by Reuters said officials have discussed lump sums ranging from $10,000 to $100,000 per person.Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory with around 57,000 residents, is rich in natural resources.Denmark has expressed alarm over the potential US actions, warning that its troops are under standing orders to ""shoot first and ask questions later"" if Greenland comes under attack. European officials have also voiced concern over the United States openly weighing military options in the Arctic territory.The plan remains at a preliminary stage, with aides estimating that total payments could amount to nearly $6 billion. Another option under discussion is a Compact of Free Association, similar to agreements the US has with several Pacific island nations, in which the United States provides financial aid and defence protection in exchange for military access. Greenland would likely need to become independent from Denmark first, and the payments could be used to encourage public support for such a step or a future agreement with the United States.Polls indicate that most Greenlanders favour independence from Denmark but do not want to become part of the United States.",President Donald Trump said the United States will take action on Greenland.
