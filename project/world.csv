"No leniency in dowry deaths, says SC, quashes bail order",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-leniency-in-dowry-deaths-says-sc-quashes-bail-order/articleshow/125649521.cms,"Noida Dowry Killing: Accused Says ‘I Have No Remorse’ After Being Shot In Police Encounter

NEW DELHI: Terming dowry as the worst social evil, Supreme Court said on Friday that courts should not show any leniency in granting bail in dowry death cases as it would not only erode public confidence in the justice delivery system but also embolden the perpetrators.It quashed the Allahabad high court order granting bail to a man accused of killing his wife within four months of their marriage after his demand for a Fortuner car was not fulfilled.A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and R Mahadevan held that HC wrongly applied the principle of 'bail is rule and jail is the exception' without considering the severity of the offence allegedly committed by the man.""This court is constrained to observe that judicial passivity or misplaced leniency in the face of such atrocities would only embolden perpetrators and undermine public confidence in the administration of justice. A firm and deterrent judicial response is, therefore, imperative - not only to uphold the majesty of law and do justice in the present case, but also to send an unequivocal message that neither law nor society will countenance barbarities born out of the evil of dowry,"" the bench said.It said permitting alleged prime perpetrators of such heinous crimes to remain at liberty on bail, when evidence indicates active infliction of physical as well as mental cruelty, may not only jeopardise fairness of the trial but also erode public faith in the administration of criminal justice.The bench said it cannot lose sight of the fact that marriage, in its true essence, is a sacred and noble institution founded on mutual trust, companionship and respect, but this pious bond has regrettably been reduced to a mere commercial transaction. ""The evil of dowry, though often sought to be camouflaged as gifts or voluntary offerings, has in reality become a means to display social status and to satiate material greed,"" it said.""The social evil of dowry not only corrodes the sanctity of marriage, but also perpetuates systemic oppression and subjugation of women. When such demands transgress the bounds of reason and culminate in cruelty - or worse, in the untimely death of a young bride - the offence transcends the private sphere of the family and assumes the character of a grave social crime. It ceases to remain a mere personal tragedy and becomes an affront to the collective conscience of society,"" it said.""The phenomenon of dowry deaths represents one of the most abhorrent manifestations of this social malaise, where the life of a young woman is extinguished within her matrimonial home - not for any fault of her own, but solely to satisfy the insatiable greed of others. Such heinous offences strike at the very root of human dignity and violate the constitutional guarantees of equality and life with dignity under Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution. They corrode the moral fibre of the community, normalise violence against women, and erode the foundations of a civilised society,"" it said.",Supreme Court quashes Allahabad high court order granting bail to a man accused of killing his wife within four months of their marriage.

Breakfast to break deadlock? Siddaramaiah calls DK Shivakumar on brass order,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/breakfast-to-break-deadlock-siddaramaiah-calls-dk-shivakumar-on-brass-order/articleshow/125649456.cms,"Dy CM’s Remark On Sonia Adds To Suspense

'All 140 MLAs Are Mine': DK Shivakumar Amid Karnataka CM Speculation; Siddaramaiah Responds

BENGALURU: With the leadership tussle in Karnataka seeing dramatic twists and turns by the hour, chief minister Siddaramaiah - following a nudge from the Congress high command - on Friday invited his deputy, DK Shivakumar , to a breakfast meeting on Saturday.Siddaramaiah said the high command had spoken to both netas and directed them to meet.""I've invited Shivakumar for breakfast at 9am. If he comes, I'll discuss (the issue) with him,"" he said, adding he would obey the high command.A senior party functionary in Delhi said both politicians had been asked to resolve the issue through discussions. ""If they don't, then the high command will intervene,"" he said.Another state functionary said the party wanted the two to present ""a mutually agreed solution"" to the high command, which it would endorse if both were on board.A day after posting a cryptic message on social media, Shivakumar Friday fired a new salvo - that of sacrifice, after promise - by invoking Sonia Gandhi's decision to forgo the prime ministership while recommending Manhoman Singh's name in 2004.Even as he lauded Sonia's leadership, Shivakumar took the opportunity to reach out to voters, urging them to continue backing the Siddaramaiah-led Congress govt. He appealed for public support in the 2028 assembly elections, describing stability as crucial for the party's long-term plans.While the remarks were framed as praise for Sonia, they triggered a debate within political circles over the message Shivakumar intended to convey. The comments sparked speculation whether he was subtly signalling that Siddaramaiah should make way (sacrifice) for him, or whether he was projecting himself as someone willing to ""sacrifice"" his chief ministerial claim.Former CM and Union minister M Veerappa Moily criticised the power tussle, calling the situation ""practically an anarchy"". In an interaction with a news agency, Moily said the open confrontation had caused ""national embarrassment"" and blamed Congress high command for ""allowing the situation to worsen"". He warned that the party, already weak in many states, could struggle to stay in govt in the state if the ""manufactured crisis"" was not addressed.Meanwhile, a day after Adichunchanagiri Mutt's Nirmalananda Swami visited Shivakumar, another prominent Vokkaliga seer, Brahmeshwara Mutt pontiff Gurugunda Nanjavadutha Swami, called on him and publicly backed him for the CM's post."," DK Shivakumar invoked Sonia Gandhi's decision to forgo the prime ministership while recommending Manhoman Singh's name in 2004.

NEW DELHI: Amid the ongoing leadership crisis in Karnataka over the chief ministerial post, veteran Congress leader M Veerappa Moily on Friday launched an attack against the party high command, saying that “discipline” has to be brought into the party.Talking to news agency IANS, the former Union minister said that the high command representatives should have foreseen some of these developments in the state.“If you want to turn it into a political turmoil, yes, it can happen, but the leaders of the Congress party who are in responsible positions, and also our high command representatives, whoever they may be, should have foreseen some of these developments. It’s not a sudden development,” Moily said.“I will not comment on who should continue, whether he should continue or whether a new Chief Minister will come or not. I am not on that. First, discipline has to be brought into the party,” he added.The Congress leader further claimed that the ongoing developments in Karnataka will party's prospects, saying that the party leadership step down.""What is going on is not in the best interest of the party. This will ruin the party's prospects,"" Moily said.""I think the Congress leadership should step down and, you know, all difficulties—people who are in charge of the states—they should be briefed from time to time about the situation here, but that is not being done. Nobody is made accountable. The people in charge of the state here, you know, are not accountable to the party at any time; accountability lies with the party,"" he added.This comes amid the ongoing tussle between Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar over the top job in the state.The deliberation over the issue has now shifted to Delhi, as both DKS and Siddaramaiah are likely to meet Mallikarjun Kharge along with Sonia and Rahul Gandhi on November 30.Earlier, Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge played down the “internal conflict” within the party and said that the “high command” will sit together and deliberate on the issue.“Only the people there can say what the government is doing. But I would like to say that we will resolve such issues,” Kharge said.“People in the high command — Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi and I — will sit together and deliberate on this… We will give the medicine when required,” he added.This was the first acknowledgment by Kharge that there is indeed a power struggle between Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar in Karnataka.As soon as the Congress government in Karnataka completed its halfway mark on November 20, reports quoting Congress sources suggested that MLAs and MLCs from Shivakumar’s faction had camped in Delhi to push the party high command to make him the next chief minister.DK Shivakumar added to the speculations after he claimed that there had indeed been “a confidential understanding on leadership transition among five-six leaders” soon after Congress won a landslide in the 2023 elections.The deputy chief minister made the first reference to the power pact but stopped short of divulging more details. “This is confidential.

NEW DELHI: Aadhaar cards will no longer be accepted as the only birth certificate or proof of date of birth in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra.""In Uttar Pradesh, Aadhaar card s will no longer be accepted as a birth certificate or proof of date of birth. The Planning Department has issued instructions to all departments. No birth certificate is attached to the Aadhaar card; therefore, it cannot be considered a birth certificate. Amit Singh Bansal, Special Secretary of the Planning Department, issued the order to all departments. The Aadhaar card is no longer valid as a birth certificate,"" the notification read.The Maharashtra government also issued a similar order that says Aadhaar card will not be considered as a document for making a delayed birth certificate and that all birth certificates made only through the Aadhaar card after the Births and Deaths Registration (Amendment) Act, 2023, will be cancelled, a notice by the State Revenue Department said.Instructions have been given to take action against the officers who have issued these certificates till now.The 16-point verification guideline by the Revenue Department said that the orders issued by the Deputy Tehsildar after the amendment made in the Birth and Death Registration Act, 1969, on August 11, 2023, should be withdrawn, and the withdrawn order should be verified at the level of the competent authority or the District Collector.The move comes even as the Supreme Court has allowed Aadhaar to be used in a different context, like as a proof of identity during inclusion in the Bihar electoral roll. Accepting a demand of the opposition, the court directed the Election Commission to accept Aadhaar along with the 11 other documents already permitted under the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) process.Last week, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath directed all district magistrates to take swift and stringent action against illegal immigrants.Reiterating that law and order, national security, and social harmony remain his administration’s top priorities, he said no form of illegal activity would be tolerated.“The chief minister has directed that each district administration ensure the identification of illegal immigrants living in their area and initiate action as per the rules,” the statement read,, according to news agency PTI.“The chief minister has also directed that temporary detention centres be established in each district to house infiltrators,” it added.As per the statement, illegal immigrants holding foreign citizenship will be kept in these centres until the required verification process is completed.Adityanath said those held in the detention facilities will be deported to their countries of origin following established procedures.Uttar Pradesh shares an open border with Nepal, allowing unrestricted movement for citizens of both countries, while individuals of other nationalities are subject to checks.This comes at a time when a nationwide SIR is being carried out in 12 states and union territories, including Uttar Pradesh, with the final elector's list to be published on February 7, 2026.","Aadhar cards will no longer be accepted as the only birth certificate or proof of date of birth in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra.

'No Longer Optional': PM Modi Calls For UNSC Reforms At IBSA Meet; Urges United Stand Against Terror

NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh on Friday hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi , asking whether he would take up South Africa’s cause with his “good friend” Donald Trump This comes after the US President announced that South Africa would not be invited to next year’s G20 Summit in Miami.In a post on X, Ramesh wrote: ""President Trump has announced that South Africa will not be a part of the next G20 Summit in the USA. The Prime Minister is the self-proclaimed champion of both Africa and the Global South. Will he take up South Africa's cause with his good friend and ensure that it will get to attend the next G20 Summit - as it is perfectly entitled to?""Earlier, on Wednesday, in a post on Truth Social, Trump announced that he would block South Africa’s participation in the 2026 summit, which will be hosted by the United States.""Therefore, at my direction, South Africa will NOT be receiving an invitation to the 2026 G20, which will be hosted in the Great City of Miami, Florida next year,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.In his post, Trump added that Washington has suspended all payments and subsidies to Pretoria. He claimed the South African government was failing to address alleged human rights abuses against white communities, accusations that Pretoria has firmly rejected.Ramesh said that South Africa has been a G20 member from the very beginning because it is the continent’s largest economy by GDP, not because of any favour from the US. He stressed that the country has been a “valued presence” in every G20 Summit since the first meeting in Washington DC in 2008.The Congress leader also highlighted the deep ties between India and South Africa, through groupings such as BRICS , IBSA and BASIC and referred to India’s historic role in supporting the anti-apartheid struggle.“South Africa and India share a special relationship. They are part of the original BRICS group also involving Brazil, Russia, and China. They are also part of IBSA along with Brazil and of BASIC as well along with Brazil and China.""Ramesh also invoked historical ties between India and South Africa, highlighting the shared legacy of struggle and cooperation.“It has often been remarked that an Indian lawyer went to South Africa in the late 19th century and returned home as a revolutionary in the early years of the 20th century to lead India’s independence movement,” he further wrote, referring to Mahatma Gandhi.Another senior Congress leader, Anand Sharma, also criticised Trump’s decision, calling it a violation of the G20’s founding principles of equality among nations. He urged India to take a “firm position” and rally the Global South against “new imperialism.”""It is an insult to the African continent and the Global South. India has a moral duty to take a firm position and mobilise the Global South to collectively reject the new imperialism,"" Sharma said.South African President Cyril Ramaphosa labelled Trump’s move “regrettable”, saying it was driven by misinformation rather than diplomatic engagement.

SRINAGAR: Leh police opened fire on protesters demanding statehood and Sixth Schedule status on Sept 24 in a “reckless and disproportionate use of lethal force” without orders from a magistrate in the Union territory, Congress and Anjuman-Moin-ul-Islam have claimed before a judicial probe commission.Anjuman is a Leh-based Muslim organisation. The claims came ahead of a Friday deadline for submissions before the panel probing the violence in which four protesters were killed and over 80 injured.Leh Apex Body (LAB), the region’s largest political and religious group that spearheaded the protests, has given the panel detailed accounts but sought more time to present evidence. Late Friday evening, the panel, headed by retired Supreme Court judge BS Chauhan, extended the deadline to Dec 8. LAB member and climate activist Sonam Wangchuk is among the over 70 people arrested over the violence. He has been booked under the stringent National Security Act (NSA).In its representation, Congress has called the police firing on the “peaceful protesters without any order from the on-duty magistrate a direct assault on the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21”.“Compounding this grave misery, many innocent persons, including prominent activist Sonam Wangchuk, continue in detention without substantial evidence against them in clear violation of Article 22’s protections against arbitrary arrest and detention,” states the Congress submission made by former minister Nawang Rigzin Jora.This is not an isolated error but “a symptom of grave mis-governance and a total failure of law enforcement, particularly in a peaceful region like Ladakh where demands for Sixth Schedule and statehood stem from genuine concerns over cultural preservation, environmental protection and equitable development”, Congress said.Seeking immediate release of the detainees, Congress said “the wounds inflicted on Sept 24 run deep in the collective psyche of Ladakh’s social fabric and the nation’s commitment to constitutional values”. “We place our hope in the commission to deliver not just findings but transformative justice and action against the barbaric act,” the party’s representation reads.In its representation, Anjuman has claimed that police “unexpectedly and without sufficient provocation, fired tear gas shells into the crowd, creating panic and chaos”. “This sudden and unprovoked action provoked retaliation in the form of stone-pelting by some agitated youths,” the Anjuman said.It added that the police resorted to direct firing using live ammunition, “targeting the crowd, (with) many victims being hit in the head and chest in clear violation of police protocols and SoPs”.The Union home ministry (MHA) had announced the commission after demands from LAB and Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA), another key Ladakh organisation.

Women in polygamous marriages: Study reveals what Muslim women experience when husbands bring in more wives

NEW DELHI: The Assam Assembly on Tuesday passed “The Assam Prohibition of Polygamy Bill, 2025,” aiming to ban polygamous marriages across the state and impose strict penalties on those who enter into or conceal a second marriage while the first is still valid.The law, introduced by Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on the first day of the winter session, will apply statewide except in Sixth Schedule areas and to members of Scheduled Tribes as defined under the Constitution.Speaking before the state assembly approved the bill, Sarma said the legislation, which bans polygamous marriages across most of Assam, is not against Islam. He said the legislation was “irrespective of religion and not against Islam as being perceived by a section”, reported PTI.""Islam can't promote polygamy. If this bill passes, then you will get a chance to be a true Muslim. This bill is not against Islam. The true Islamic people will welcome this Act. Countries like Turkey have also banned Polygamy; there is an arbitration council in Pakistan...""

Parents allege ‘culture of bullying’ at private school

(With agency inputs)

JAIPUR: A Class 4 student at a Jaipur school, who died by suicide weeks ago, had reportedly faced bullying in her classroom for over 18 months, including verbal abuse from classmates, while the school failed to maintain a safe and healthy environment, according to a CBSE enquiry report.Following the findings, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) issued a show-cause notice to Neerja Modi School in Jaipur. The notice comes after a CBSE-formed enquiry panel investigated the tragic death of the 9-year-old girl, who reportedly jumped off the school building earlier this month.ACP Mansarover Aditya Kakade said that an investigation in the case is underway. ""The case is being investigated. No arrest has been made so far,"" he said.The enquiry committee highlighted multiple lapses by the school, noting the persistent bullying the girl endured. It stated that her parents had initially reported the issue to teachers in July 2024. The panel further observed that the class teacher failed to respond to the child’s distress, despite the girl approaching the teacher five times in the last 45 minutes of her life.""As per the statements of the parents given to the committee, it is clear that the school did not take any preventive and proactive action on the repeated complaints of bullying and teasing by the classmates. The class teacher and the school management were very well aware of the harassment and the trauma being faced by the deceased child,"" the board noted in the show-cause.The board further said that the conversation and communications made by the parents to the class teacher and the school management went unheard, and accused the school of not taking any action or having any compliance and provisions for a grievance redressal mechanism in such circumstances.Citing the enquiry committee report, the board said, "" it seems something unusual happened in class and she is looking extremely disturbed. A few hot discussions among students are also observed, and it may be related to the use of bad words and some derogatory comments, as per parents' observation and video footage"".The class teacher, in her written statement, admitted that the deceased student informed her about her classmate using ""bad words"" for her, but the other student denied the allegations. However, other children had complained to the teacher earlier about the constant usage of ""bad words"" in the classroom between students, the show-cause read.The board also noted that the school's committee and policy mechanism were entirely ""non-responsive""According to the report, the parents of the deceased reported the bullying to the teachers and coordinators more than three times over the 1.5 years, yet the anti-bullying committee never contacted the parents or intervened.In September 2025, the father witnessed a boy bullying the girl during a PTM and complained to the class teacher, who allegedly advised that the child ""should adjust,"" the report says.""The school failed to maintain a healthy atmosphere and lacked specific measures to tackle bullying,"" the report states, adding that these were clear violations of CBSE guidelines, Supreme Court directives and NCPCR safety norms.The Class 4 girl tragically ended her life by jumping from the school’s fourth floor on November 1. Given the gravity of the incident, a two-member CBSE committee visited the school the following day and also met with the girl’s parents.The committee’s findings reveal a troubling pattern of harassment and neglect on that day. The girl arrived at school in a cheerful mood, but after 11 am, she became visibly upset following interactions with classmates involving a digital slate, on which some boys wrote or displayed content that embarrassed and distressed her.CCTV footage reviewed by the committee shows the girl repeatedly asking the boys to stop and erase the content. It also confirms that she approached the class teacher five times in the final 45 minutes of her life, seeking assistance, the report states.The report pulled up the teacher for failing to act on the child's distress, ""even when she approached her five times in the final 45 minutes of her life. The teacher's admitted negligence and reported aggressive response (""shouting"") directly contravenes the requirement for staff to ensure a safe, supportive environment and to act as protective caregivers,"" it said.Beyond the bullying complaints, the committee identified several safety and infrastructure lapses. These include inadequate CCTV monitoring, failure to flag the child's unsupervised movement across multiple floors and the absence of floor attendants at the time of the incident.The stairway from which the child fell had railings described as ""easily scalable and unprotected,"" and the building allegedly had more floors than permissible under school safety guidelines, the report noted.The report also pointed out violations of CBSE regulations, including the mandate to store CCTV footage for 15 days, non-compliance with child protection guidelines, and the school’s failure to offer psychological support despite clear signs of the child’s distress.Several parents gathered at Shaheed Smarak Saturday to protest and demand action against Neerja Modi School, where 9-year-old Amaira Kumar fell to her death from the fourth floor on Nov 1. They alleged that incidents of bullying at the school were ""not isolated, but rampant"".","The Central Board of Secondary Education issued a show-cause notice to Neerja Modi School in Jaipur.

ED Cracks Down On ‘White-Collar Terror Module’, Conducts 25 Raids Linked To Al-Falah University

FARIDABAD: The investigation into the Nov 10 Delhi terror attack and the white coat terror module involving doctors has led sleuths to two more hideouts linked to Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie, the Al-Falah University professor who was making explosives that were to be used as IEDs in cars.Ganaie, according to investigators, had hid 2,600kg ammonium nitrate at a shed in a field behind a mosque adjoining the Al-Falah University campus for 12 days before shifting it to a cleric's house in Fatehpur Taga, from where it was eventually seized just a day before the Delhi blast.Muzammil had also rented a three-room house in Khori Jamalpur, around 8km from Al-Falah University, in July. This property, which is above a plastic raw materials unit owned by the village's former sarpanch Jumma, was leased for Rs 8,000 a month.Muzammil told the owner he needed the property to start a fruit supply business and intended to bring stocks from Kashmir for local sale. He frequently visited the house, according to investigators, often accompanied by Dr Shahin Shaheed, another Al-Falah doctor linked to the terror module and now in custody of National Investigation Agency (NIA).Although Muzammil introduced her as a family member to the sarpanch, he has confessed to NIA that Shahin is his wife.He vacated the property after three months.Police had earlier found two premises rented by Ganaie in which he kept ammonium nitrate, the larger haul at the cleric's house and a 350kg tranche in a smaller room in Dhauj. Ganaie had also procured a grinder and a portable furnace to process the ammonium nitrate and used it to build explosives. He kept this equipment at the house of a local cab driver he knew.Jumma told investigators that he first encountered Muzammil while seeking treatment for his cancer-stricken nephew at Al-Falah Hospital, where he also met Dr Umar Un Nabi, the Delhi bomber who was in the i20 that blew up outside Red Fort metro station on Nov 10, killing 15 people. Umar was a professor of medicine at Al-Falah.The shed where the ammonium nitrate was initially parked is owned by a local who Muzammil met at the mosque. Muzammil convinced him to allow him to store the sacks at the shed, not telling him what they contained, just items he needed to arrange some space for. It was only when the resident expressed concern about theft that Muzammil shifted the entire stock, along with other materials, to the house of cleric Mohd Istaq in Fatehpur Taga. A joint team of Faridabad police and J&K Police recovered the ammonium nitrate from the cleric's premises on Nov 9.NIA sleuths took Muzammil to Khori Jamalpur, where former sarpanch Jumma identified him. Investigators spent several hours at the location, quizzing the family about Muzammil's visits, his companions and activities inside the rented premises.Investigators said the chemical used in the Delhi blast was sourced from NIT Nehru Ground. NIA conducted a raid on Thursday at BR Scientific and Chemicals, a shop situated in NIT Nehru Ground, Faridabad. Sources indicated that the shop is owned by Lal Babu, a licensed chemical dealer. This store supplies chemicals to laboratories in various hospitals, as well as to colleges and universities. During questioning, Dr. Muzammil disclosed that he had purchased the chemical from this shop. NIA scrutinised the store's records and confiscated several documents for further investigation.","Investigators uncovered two more hideouts linked to Al-Falah University professor Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie, who was making IEDs.

NEW DELHI: The power tussle for the top post in Karnataka Congress turned ugly on Thursday with chief minister Siddaramaiah taking open potshots at his deputy DK Shivakumar. Hours after Shivakumar posted a cryptic message reminding Siddaramaiah and the Congress high command to ""keep one's word and walk the talk"", the chief minister has hit back using ""word play"" to target his deputy.Earlier today, Shivakumar in a post on X wrote, ""WORD POWER IS WORLD POWER. The biggest force in the world is to keep one’s word. Be it a judge, president or anyone else including myself, everyone has to walk the talk. Word power is world power.""The state Congress president, who is eyeing the top post as part of a ""secret deal"" in 2023 for rotational CM following the party's sweeping victory in the assembly elections, wants Siddaramaiah to honour the commitment made then by the party leadership.Siddaramaiah, who has often asserted that he will complete his term of 5 years, made an interesting response to DKS message. The chief minister used the same words to take potshots at his deputy.""A Word is not power unless it betters the World for the people. The mandate given by the people of Karnataka is not a moment, but a responsibility that lasts five full years. The Congress party , including me, is walking the talk for our people with compassion, consistency, and courage.Our Word to Karnataka is not a slogan, it means the World to us,"" Siddaramaiah wrote on X.Siddaramaiah then went on to list the promises that he had fulfilled as the chief minister in his two tenures.This open social media ""word"" war between the two top state leaders marks a definite shift in their approach. Till now, it was the supporters of the two leaders who were engaging in verbal spats. But with Siddaramaiah completing two-and-a-half years as chief minister, DKS has clearly upped the ante.The ball is in the court of Congress high command, but the open spat between the two leaders could well damage the prospects of the grand-old-party even if it manages to save its government for now.","Siddaramaiah takes open potshots at his deputy DK Shivakumar on social media.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A case was registered against suspended Congress MLA Rahul Mamkoottathil on Friday after a woman accused him of sexual assault and forcing her to terminate a pregnancy, police said.The case was registered at the Valiyamala Police Station here in the early morning based on the woman's statement recorded late Thursday night.Meanwhile, Mamkoottathil denied the allegations against him, calling them politically motivated, in an anticipatory bail petition filed in a court on Friday.The complainant had approached Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan with her grievance on Thursday.Her detailed statement was later recorded by women police officers at the Thiruvananthapuram Rural Police headquarters, sources said.The procedures continued till late at night, after which a decision was taken to register the case.Mamkoottathil's friend Joby Joseph, a native of Adoor, who allegedly handed over medicine to the complainant for abortion, was also named as an accused.As per the FIR, Mamkoottathil assaulted the complainant and raped her on multiple occasions.It stated that on March 17, the woman's videos were recorded at her apartment, and he allegedly threatened to release them if their relationship became public.The FIR further said that although he knew she was pregnant, Mamkoottathil allegedly raped her at her apartment on April 22, and again over two days in the last week of May at his apartment in Palakkad.On May 30, the second accused, Joby Joseph, described as a close associate of Mamkoottathil, allegedly handed over abortion pills to the complainant inside a car. Mamkoottathil then allegedly forced her to consume the pills to terminate the pregnancy.The case has been registered under Sections 64(2)(f) (rape by a person in a position of trust or authority), 64(2)(h) (rape knowing the woman is pregnant), 64(2)(m) (repeated rape on the same woman), 89 (causing miscarriage without consent), 115(2) (voluntarily causing hurt), 351(3) (criminal intimidation), and 3(5) (joint criminal liability) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.Police have also invoked Section 66(E) of the Information Technology Act for the alleged recording and threat of misuse of private images.Nemom police have re-registered the FIR after the case was transferred from Valiyamala police station.A special investigation team has been constituted, and a lookout circular has been issued to prevent the accused from leaving the country.Mamkoottathil and Joseph are reportedly absconding, and police efforts to trace them have so far been unsuccessful.Congress leaders in Palakkad said Mamkoottathil was actively campaigning in the Kannadi area for local body elections till around 4 pm on Thursday, after which he and a close associate were not seen.Meanwhile, Mamkoottathil filed an anticipatory bail petition at the Thiruvananthapuram District and Principal Sessions Court by evening. In the petition, he claimed that the complainant's allegations are fabricated and politically motivated.Mamkoottathil stated that they became friends through Facebook and that he showed empathy towards her after she complained about domestic violence.He asserted that their relationship involved consensual sex and denied impregnating her. He also rejected the accusation that he forced the woman to terminate her pregnancy, the petition said.He maintained that the audio clips and chat details were leaked during the civic body elections and alleged that instead of approaching the police, she directly went to the chief minister with the complaint.The court will consider the anticipatory bail petition on Monday. Meanwhile, the complainant's confidential statement was recorded by a Judicial First Class Magistrate in Neyyattinkara on Friday afternoon.Earlier, the Crime Branch had registered a case based on initial audio clips and chat messages that surfaced after third-party individuals sent an email to the police headquarters, as the woman had not come forward at the time.Two days ago, another purported audio clip was released, in which he was heard initially expressing a desire for a child but later urging the woman to undergo an abortion. Mamkoottathil was suspended from the primary membership of the Congress on August 25.He had earlier resigned as Youth Congress state president after Malayalam actress Rini Ann George accused a young leader of misbehaviour, prompting protests by the BJP and the DYFI, the youth wing of the CPI(M).Subsequently, several women and a transgender person also levelled allegations against him.

US secretary of state Marco Rubio made it clear that the United States’ visa policy does not automatically entitle a student to a visa.Speaking in detail to Ben Shapiro, Rubio said, “No one. It’s not a constitutional right. It’s not guaranteed by law. Every day, consular officers deny visas for all kinds of reasons, suspicion of overstaying, criminal associations, whatever it may be. Visas are denied worldwide daily. No one is entitled to one.”Rubio explained that there is a common misconception that applicants are automatically allowed entry unless a reason to deny the visa is found. “That’s not true. The burden of proof is the other way around,” he said.Rubio weighed in on national security concerns, saying, if a student visa applicant openly supports terrorist organisations like Hamas, or anything that goes against the principles of American policies, they would likely be denied entry. “We probably wouldn’t let them in — and we shouldn’t,” Rubio added. He clarified that if such support becomes evident after someone has already entered the US, the visa should still be revoked, even though it may take extra formalities.“If we later discover information that would have led to denial in the first place, that’s grounds for revocation,” he said.Rubio focused on Trump's 'America First' stance in his brief explanation. “It’s not in the national interest, or our foreign policy or national security interest, to bring people onto our campuses who aren’t just studying but are also promoting or excusing terrorist organisations committed to violence and destruction.”The secretary concluded and reaffirmed that the government’s authority is supreme: “So we have the right to deny visas before entry and revoke them after entry if someone’s presence undermines our national security or interests. That’s exactly what we intend to do.”His comments come as US President Donald Trump took a softer stance on H1-B visas. In a Fox News interview earlier this month, the MAGA chief said that the United States lacks talent and needs foreign skilled workers from abroad to fill critical roles such as tech and defence. The conservative Republican base grew angry and accused Trump of betraying the GOP’s hardline immigration principles.","US secretary of state Marco Rubio made it clear that the United States’ visa policy does not automatically entitle a student to a visa.

From chainsaws to silence: DOGE's brief tenure



DOGE staff scattered across government as agency dissolves







The Department of Government Efficiency, the cost-cutting initiative led by billionaire Elon Musk that dominated the early months of President Donald Trump's second term, has been shut down with eight months remaining on its charter, according to Reuters, in what appears to be the administration's ultimate cost-saving measure.""That doesn't exist,"" Office of Personnel Management Director Scott Kupor told Reuters when asked about DOGE's status, confirming it is no longer a ""centralised entity."" The OPM has since absorbed many of DOGE's functions, marking the end of an agency that promised sweeping government reform but delivered questionable results.Created in January through executive order, DOGE was expected to operate through July 2026. The agency made dramatic efforts to shrink federal agencies, cut budgets, and redirect work to Trump priorities in its early months. Elon Musk, who initially led the department, regularly promoted its work on social media and famously brandished a chainsaw at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February, declaring it ""the chainsaw for bureaucracy. ""DOGE claimed to have slashed tens of billions of dollars in expenditures, but outside financial experts found it impossible to verify these claims because the unit never provided detailed public accounting.The agency's website still claims approximately $214 billion in savings, though a Politico review found the numbers were inflated by counting maximum possible contract values rather than actual spending reductions.The shut down follows Musk's public feud with Trump in May, after which Musk left Washington and exited DOGE. Musk's ""right-hand man,"" Steve Davis , also departed shortly after his boss's exit.By May, more than 200,000 federal workers had been laid off and roughly 75,000 had accepted buyouts.Former DOGE employees have moved to new positions throughout the administration. Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia now heads Trump's National Design Studio, tasked with beautifying government websites. So far, his design studio has launched websites to recruit law enforcement officers to patrol Washington, D.C., and advertise the president's drug pricing program.Edward Coristine, a DOGE employee nicknamed ""Big Balls,"" has also joined Gebbia's National Design Studio effort, encouraging his followers on X to apply to the new body.Acting DOGE Administrator Amy Gleason formally became an adviser to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in March, according to court filings, with her public statements largely focused on her HHS role. Zachary Terrell, part of the DOGE team given access to government health systems early in Trump's second term, is now chief technology officer at the Department of Health and Human Services, while Rachel Riley, who had similar access, now serves as chief of the Office of Naval Research.Jeremy Lewin, who helped Musk dismantle the US Agency for International Development, now oversees foreign assistance at the State Department. Scott Langmack, DOGE's representative at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, has been tasked by the White House budget office with creating custom AI applications to analyze US regulations and determine which ones to eliminate, according to his LinkedIn profile.The government-wide hiring freeze, another hallmark of DOGE, has also ended, with Kupor stating there is no longer a target for workforce reductions.Spokeswoman Liz Huston told Reuters only that Trump ""continues to actively deliver"" on reducing waste and fraud. Trump himself has begun referring to DOGE in the past tense in recent statements to reporters, subtly signaling its demise without formal acknowledgment.","Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk, has been shut down with eight months remaining on its charter.

A Republican senator from Indiana has said he will vote against the state’s redistricting plan after Donald Trump used an insulting term for people with intellectual disabilities on social media.Senator Michael Bohacek made the announcement on Facebook, saying he received many questions about his position.Bohacek wrote that he has been “an unapologetic advocate for people with intellectual disabilities” since the birth of his second daughter.""Those of you who don't know my family or me might not know that my daughter has Down Syndrome,"" he said. ""This is not the first time the president has used these insulting and derogatory references and his choice of words have consequences,"" Bohacek added.He said he will vote no on redistricting and suggested that Trump could use the next ten months to convince voters that his behaviour and policies deserve a congressional majority.His comments came after Trump used the word to describe Minnesota governor Tim Walz in a post on Truth Social. Trump claimed that Somali immigrants were “taking over” Minnesota and criticised Walz for not acting.“Somalian gangs are roving the streets looking for “prey” as our wonderful people stay locked in their apartments and houses hoping against hope that they will be left alone.The seriously retarded governor of Minnesota, Tim Walz, does nothing, either through fear, incompetence, or both, while the worst,” Trump had written on Truth Social.Walz, 61, responded with a jab of his own, posting on X, “Release the MRI results,” referring to the MRI Trump reportedly had during a visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in October.Meanwhile, Indiana lawmakers are preparing to meet again in December to make a final decision on redistricting after the Senate said it did not have enough support to pass the new map.Republicans argue that redrawing the map could turn the state’s two Democratic House seats into Republican wins.","Senator Michael Bohacek made the announcement on Facebook, saying he received many questions about his position.

Hong Kong Horror: New Footage Shows Exact Moment Fire Started And Swept High-Rise Towers | On Cam

Warnings ignored, accountability questioned

Hong Kong mourns as search efforts continue





More than a year before a massive blaze tore through the Wang Fuk Court housing estate in Hong Kong, residents had raised an alarm over the use of flammable construction materials during ongoing renovation works.Their concerns, largely dismissed at the time, have now resurfaced at the centre of a widening investigation into one of Hong Kong’s worst fire disasters in decades.The inferno, which broke out on Wednesday afternoon and rapidly spread across seven of the complex’s eight high-rise towers, has so far claimed at least 128 lives.Officials said at least 79 people have been injured, including 12 firefighters, while around 200 residents are still missing.Authorities say the blaze erupted on bamboo scaffolding and protective netting installed for large-scale repairs at the ageing estate, before spreading swiftly due to highly flammable polystyrene boards and foam panels placed around windows.Fire alarms in all eight buildings were found to be malfunctioning, leaving residents with no warning as the flames engulfed their homes.Residents had alerted the Hong Kong Labour Department as early as September 2024, raising concerns about fire hazards linked to the scaffolding netting and foam materials.Emails show officials first claimed there were no specific regulations covering flame-retardant standards for such netting. They later assured residents that the materials met safety requirements, citing certificates submitted by the contractor, as reported by The New York Times.Authorities now acknowledge that the foam boards were highly flammable and accelerated the fire’s spread. Security Secretary Chris Tang said the blaze generated extreme temperatures and caused scaffolding to collapse, blocking exits and hampering rescue attempts.Three men associated with the renovation, including the directors and a consultant of the construction company were arrested on Thursday on suspicion of manslaughter and gross negligence.On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) arrested eight more people, including engineering consultants, scaffolding subcontractors and an intermediary, over suspected corruption linked to the project.Officials are examining whether substandard materials were knowingly used and whether fraud may have been involved in safety certifications.A three-day official mourning period began on Saturday, with Chief Executive John Lee leading senior officials in observing a moment of silence as flags flew at half-mast.Grief-stricken families continue to search hospitals and victim identification centres for missing loved ones.Relief centres and emergency shelters are housing nearly 900 displaced residents, while authorities warn the death toll may rise further as teams comb through charred units for remains.The tragedy has sparked urgent calls for stronger safety oversight, particularly in older public housing blocks undergoing renovation. Nationwide inspections of scaffolding and construction materials are now underway.As Hong Kong confronts its deadliest blaze since 1948, grieving residents continue to ask why clear warnings went unheeded and whether this devastation could have been prevented.","Residents had raised concerns about flammable construction materials in September 2024.

Hong Kong on Saturday entered a three-day official mourning period for victims of the devastating fire at the Wang Fuk Court residential complex in Tai Po, as the death toll climbed to 128 and investigations widened.Authorities also announced that eight more people have been arrested in connection with the tragedy, one of the worst building fires the city has seen in decades.The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) said the latest arrests include engineering consultants, scaffolding subcontractors and a middleman involved in renovation works at the estate.They are being investigated for suspected corruption linked to repair and maintenance projects at the site, news agency ANI reported, citing the Global Times.The blaze erupted on Wednesday afternoon on scaffolding at one of the towers under large-scale renovation, before rapidly spreading to six neighbouring blocks covered with protective netting and construction materials.Firefighters battled the flames for more than 40 hours and used a team of nearly 1,000 personnel for rescue.Officials said at least 79 people have been injured, including 12 firefighters, while around 200 residents are still missing.Nearly 900 evacuees have been moved to temporary shelters as search and relief efforts continue.Early findings from the government’s briefing revealed alarming safety failures. Fire Services Director Andy Yeung confirmed that alarm systems in all eight buildings malfunctioned, leaving residents with no warning as the flames engulfed their homes.Investigators also found highly flammable polystyrene boards, foam packaging, bamboo scaffolding, and non-compliant netting around the building. These materials significantly accelerated the spread of the fire, according to AFP.“We do not rule out the possibility that police will find more charred remains when entering (the building) for detailed investigation and evidence collection,” Security Secretary Chris Tang told reporters.He added that the identification process for victims is still ongoing.Earlier, three men linked to the renovation contract were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and gross negligence. The Hong Kong government has now ordered urgent, city-wide inspections of all scaffolding and construction materials used in renovation works.As the mourning period began, Chief Executive John Lee led senior officials in a three-minute silence as flags flew at half-mast. Across the city, condolence points were set up and residents laid flowers near the charred towers.Families are still searching hospitals and identification centres for loved ones.“She is on antibiotics... so she is always sleeping. There was no fire alarm… she might not have known there was a fire,” said Mr Fung, who has been trying to locate his elderly mother-in-law.The blaze has become Hong Kong’s deadliest fire since 1948 and has raised urgent questions over safety compliance in ageing public housing. Authorities say a full investigation could take up to four weeks.","Authorities also announced that eight more people have been arrested in connection with the tragedy.

BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia hospitalised; condition 'extremely critical',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bnp-chairperson-khaleda-zia-hospitalised-condition-extremely-critical/articleshow/125650030.cms,".





Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chairperson and former prime minister Khaleda Zia is in “extremely critical” condition, a close aide said on Friday, as she continues treatment in hospital. The 80-year-old leader was admitted on Sunday night after developing a chest infection that affected both her heart and lungs.“Last night, the doctors said that her physical condition is extremely critical,” BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said on Friday, as quoted by PTI, citing the state-run BSS news agency.Following Friday prayers, the BNP organized special prayer gatherings across the country for her recovery. “We have sought prayers from the people across the country after Jummah prayers for the recovery of the ‘Mother of Democracy’, Begum Khaleda Zia. We pray that she may recover and return to the people to get the opportunity to work for the country,” Fakhrul added.Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus expressed deep concern over Zia’s condition and urged everyone to pray for her early recovery. His office said Yunus has been regularly inquiring about updates on her health and has instructed officials to ensure every form of necessary medical support.“There must not be any shortcomings in Begum Khaleda Zia's treatment. The government is prepared to provide all necessary support,” Yunus said. “At this crucial moment of democratic transition, Begum Khaleda Zia is a profound source of inspiration for the nation. Her good health is extremely important for the country.”Zia has long suffered from multiple health complications, including liver and kidney issues, diabetes, arthritis, and eye-related illnesses. She is the widow of slain president Zia-ur Rahman. Her elder son, Tarique Rahman, has been living in London since 2008, while her younger son, Arafat Rahman, died of a cardiac arrest in 2025.With national elections approaching next year, Zia’s health is seen as particularly significant for the party. The BNP has emerged as a key player in Bangladesh’s changing political landscape after a student-led protest toppled Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League government on August 5, 2024.Earlier this year, Zia returned to Bangladesh from London on May 6 after spending four months abroad for advanced medical treatment.","The 80-year-old leader was admitted on Sunday night after developing a chest infection that affected both her heart and lungs.

America’s Spy Network COLLAPSES In Caribbean; NATO Allies CUT Intel Ties After ‘Drug-Boat’ Strikes

REPORT: Second strike to kill survivors on alleged drug boats





The US military reportedly carried out a second strike on a suspected drug boat in the Caribbean on September 2 to kill survivors.Defence secretary Pete Hegseth reportedly instructed the military before the operation to ensure no one survived. “The order was to kill everybody,” a source told Washington Post.The September strike became the first in a series of US attacks on suspected drug boats in the region. The first strike reportedly disabled the vessel and caused several deaths. When the military assessed that some crew members were still alive, a second strike was launched. All 11 people on board were killed, and the boat was sunk.Briefing materials given to the White House said that the “double-tap,” or follow-up strike, was meant to sink the boat and clear a navigation hazard for other vessels, not to target survivors, according to someone who saw the report.Officials have admitted they do not always know who is on board before launching strikes. This has alarmed lawmakers.""I have been alarmed by the number of vessels that this administration has taken out without a single consultation of Congress,” Democratic Rep Madeleine Dean told CNN this week.Pentagon has defended the actions, saying they comply with US and international law. The administration claims the boats carry individuals linked to drug cartels posing an imminent threat.But legal experts argue these groups are not combatants and should be treated as criminals, not enemy fighters.In a social media post on Friday, Hegseth again defended the strikes on suspected drug boats.“Our current operations in the Caribbean are lawful under both US and international law, with all actions in compliance with the law of armed conflict and approved by the best military and civilian lawyers, up and down the chain of command,” he said.","The US military reportedly carried out a second strike on a suspected drug boat in the Caribbean on September 2 to kill survivors.

UN calls on Pakistan to respect Imran Khan's human-rights





Former Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan 's son Kasim Khan on Thursday claimed his father has been kept in a ""death cell with zero transparency"", despite Islamabad refuting rumours that the cricketer-turned-politician was “brutally” assaulted by police for seeking a meeting with their brother last week.Kasim Khan said there have been ""no phone calls, no meetings and no proof of life. Me and my brother have had no contact with our father.""He alleged that the former prime minister, who has been under arrest for 845 days, has been kept in solitary confinement for the past six weeks. He also said that Khan’s sisters have been denied permission to visit him despite court orders allowing access.Kasim further alleged that the Shehbaz Sharif-led government and “its handlers” will be held accountable “legally, morally and internationally”.He also urged the international community to “intervene urgently” and demand proof of life.Earlier, Imran Khan’s sister, Noreen Niazi, accused Pakistani authorities of keeping the former prime minister in harsh prison conditions and cutting off all family contact, claiming that “no one knows what’s happening inside the jail.”Speaking to ANI about her last meeting with the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder, she said, “...Heis going through a tough time alone. He is in isolation... As per the jail manual, one can't be placed in isolation for more than 4 days. But he was put in isolation for three weeks last year as well, during which electricity was switched off, and he wasn't even allowed to read books. The same has been done now.”Her allegations come against the backdrop of growing speculation about Khan’s health and the month-long blackout on family and legal visits. “We don't know anything. They are not telling us anything, nor are they letting anybody meet him,” she said, adding that even PTI members with approved meetings were prevented from entering.“We have not been allowed to meet him for the last four weeks... The Police have been ordered to stop us and, I believe, also given permission to do to us whatever they want. This has never happened in Pakistan before,” she said.Niazi described the treatment of supporters and family members outside Adiala Jail as unprecedented. “No one has ever disrespected women like this, nor has anyone been oppressed this way. This is the first time in Pakistan that these people have been allowed to beat up people like there won't be any consequences, without considering if it's a child, an elderly person, or a woman in front of them. The world is aware of what's happening in Pakistan. ”She called the current situation Pakistan’s “darkest period”, comparing it to “Hitler-era-like repression”, and alleged that people are being “killed, beaten, and jailed without accountability”. She argued that the continued ban on meeting Khan was intentional. “We have been going there for the last four weeks, and they are not letting us meet him. This is why such rumours are spreading.”Warning of growing frustration, she said public anger is nearing a tipping point. “I believe there will be a spark among people soon, and then they will see the level to which the people go... The oppression is too much.”Expressing no expectations from the global community, she said: ""... We have such support from outside that Trump called our dictator Asim Munir a very good friend of his... Shehbaz Sharif had lost his seat. Asim Munir helped him win, so he is the bigger force... Dictators have come before. Their fates were not good either. But how long can these people survive, or how long can they continue to oppress?""Meanwhile, adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah and senior Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leaders on Thursday rejected rumours about former prime minister Imran Khan’s deteriorating health, saying the PTI founder was “fine and nothing is wrong with him,” reported Pakistan daily Dawn News.Earlier in the day, the PTI pressed for a meeting with the jailed leader, expressing concern over his condition after he was denied access to his family and lawyers for more than three weeks. Imran has been in prison since August 2023, serving a 14-year sentence in a corruption case.His family members and party activists have been staging protests outside Adiala Jail in recent days, demanding he be allowed visitors. A PTI delegation once again attempted to meet him on Thursday, but authorities refused permission.The UN's deputy spokesperson reaffirmed that the world body has urged Pakistani authorities to ensure the human rights and due-process rights of Imran Khan are respected.This follows his arrest and ongoing legal proceedings -- the UN has emphasized that in such politically sensitive cases, fair treatment under law and procedural fairness are essential.In a response to ANI, United Nations deputy spokesperson Farhan Haq said, ""We have called for his human rights and due process rights to be respected.""","Pakistan Erupts As Imran Khan’s Son Claims ‘No Proof Of Life’ Amid CM Afridi's Jail-Side Protest.'Darkest period' in Pakistan, says sister Noreen Niazi.

The government closed offices and schools Friday as conditions worsened, reported AP. Heavy downpours since last week flooded homes, fields, and roads, triggering landslides across the island. Overflowing rivers and reservoirs have blocked key roads, while rocks, mud, and fallen trees have obstructed roads and railway tracks, some of which were submerged, forcing authorities to suspend passenger train services in many areas.The central tea-growing district of Badulla was worst hit, where 21 people were killed overnight when a landslide buried homes, the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) said. Four more died in neighboring Nuwara Eliya, while other fatalities were reported across the country. Over 1,800 families have been moved to temporary shelters, AFP reported.Videos shared on social media showed homes being washed away, while military and navy personnel used helicopters and boats to rescue stranded residents. Students scheduled for Advanced Level exams also had their tests postponed, BBC reported.Sri Lanka is currently in its northeast monsoon season, worsened by Cyclone Ditwah, which formed off the island’s eastern coast and is expected to move toward India. River levels continue to rise, prompting the DMC to warn residents in low-lying areas, including Colombo, to move to higher ground. The Irrigation Department issued a red-level flood warning for the Kelani River valley over the next 48 hours, and the Met Office has forecast over 200 mm of rainfall in some central and northern regions on Friday.BBC cited DMC saying that around 20,500 army personnel have been deployed nationwide to aid in rescue and relief operations.","Heavy downpours since last week have flooded homes, fields, and roads, triggering landslides across the island.

Projection disguised as commentary





The ending that should disturb all of us









Since Donald Trump announced he would be picking JD Vance to be his running mate, Usha Vance has undergone the kind of scrutiny that has hardly ever occurred to an Indian-American. MAGA folks freaked out that she was a practising Hindu, and it was immaterial that her faith had helped JD find Christ again. Democrats wondered how a person with Usha’s credentials (Yale, academic family) could be with someone like JD or who followed JD’s politics. JD Vance hasn’t helped himself, like the time he told a Turning Point USA audience that he hoped his “agnostic” wife — what a way to erase her religion — would embrace Christ, even doubling down to claim that it was every Christian’s job to help others see the light. But even after all the disparaging rumours aimed at Usha Vance, a recent podcast featuring Joy Reid starkly shows how easy it is for people to dehumanise Indian-Americans.Reid, wearing a t-shirt that says F*** Trump, F*** ICE, Free Palestine, Unoccupy Chicago, and a bunch of other messages which combined explain the dire strait in which the Democratic Party finds itself, casually claims that JD Vance will drop his “brown Hindu wife” Usha for “white queen” Erika Kirk.What makes this moment especially disturbing is how neatly it fits into the rise of anti-India hate online and offline.In recent years, Indians in the West have found themselves cast into every role except that of actual human beings. They are colonial agents one day, fascist foot soldiers the next, tech bros on Monday, caste villains on Tuesday, and accidental beneficiaries of “white adjacency” by the weekend. It is a rotating caricature factory that reduces 1.4 billion people to whichever label best suits the Western cultural mood. And Indian-Americans are often caught at the intersection of all these projections. The same progressives who champion diversity suddenly talk as if Hindu identity is a contaminated category. The same conservatives who praise family values treat brown families as demographic threats. Usha Vance, unfortunately, becomes the perfect canvas for the week’s anxieties. Not because of anything she said, but because her existence unsettles the simplistic narratives both sides prefer.The moment Reid begins to speak, it is clear this is not analysis. It is improvisation dressed up as political insight. “They can’t have the successor to MAGA be the guy with the brown Hindu wife,” she declares, as if she has unlocked a hidden psychological truth about an entire voting bloc. She calls them “Christian nationalists,” insists Usha “won’t work,” and then suggests JD Vance is either sacrificing his wife for ambition or that Usha herself is complicit in the performance.She then fixates on JD Vance’s public hug with Erika Kirk, calling it “slap-and-tickle” and “the weirdest shit,” and pivots to critiquing Erika’s clothing with, “You’re supposed to be a widow. You in leather pants?” These are not the observations of a serious political thinker. They are the lines of someone scrolling through gossip threads and mistaking them for structural analysis.Finally she arrives at the centrepiece of her theory. “Wouldn’t it be the most perfect MAGA fairytale if he finally sees the light that he needs a white queen instead of this brown Hindu.” She adds a quick “I’m not saying that’s happening,” but the narrative is already complete. The hierarchy is drawn. The brown woman is written out.What is most striking about the segment is the contradiction between Reid’s t-shirt and her argument. She wears slogans about liberation, solidarity, resistance and justice. Then she denies every one of those ideals to a brown woman who did nothing except marry someone with different politics.Reid says she is calling out racism, but she ends up performing it. She does not see Usha Vance as a lawyer, a mother, a daughter of immigrants or a woman balancing two faith traditions. She sees her as a demographic problem. A cultural obstacle. An inconvenient symbol of brownness and Hindu identity that, in her mind, cannot fit inside a movement she despises.It is easy to condemn racism when it comes from the other side. It is harder to notice when it slips out while criticising the other side. The t-shirt says “Free Palestine.” The monologue denies empathy to an Indian-American Hindu woman who is, by every measure, as much a minority as anyone Reid claims to defend.Underneath the moral performance, the entire theory comes from three unrelated moments. Erika Kirk, grieving the murder of her husband, said she wished she had been pregnant when he died. It was a moment of pain, not a confession. JD Vance hugged her on stage in full public view. It was sympathy, not symbolism. And Usha Vance appeared without her wedding ring one afternoon. It was an ordinary oversight, not a marital crisis.None of these events belong together. They were stitched into a story only because the internet craves drama. And instead of challenging that logic, Reid absorbed it, embroidered it and presented it as something profound.The widow became an archetype. The wife became a liability. The husband became a character in a political telenovela.It was rumour inflated into racial prophecy.There is a special cruelty in dragging two women into a plot they never agreed to inhabit. Erika Kirk is barely beginning her life as a widow, yet she is recast as a “white queen” waiting in the wings. Usha Vance, who has kept an almost painfully private profile, is turned into an emblem of “brown Hindu” undesirability. Neither woman asked to be the heroine or the villain of this fever dream. Neither deserves to be reduced to the colour wheel of someone else’s political imagination.JD Vance, for all his flaws, becomes a piece on a board. In Reid’s story he is not a husband or father. He is a man conducting a marital reshuffle to please a base that exists only inside her claim.The humanity is lost. What remains is theatre.The problem is not simply that Joy Reid repeated a conspiracy. It is that she treated it as obvious. She began with the assumption that MAGA is racist and ended with the conclusion that its chosen successor must behave in ways that confirm her view. It is commentary built backwards: the conclusion arrives first, the justification later. This is the same logic she spent years accusing right-wing media of using. Start with the villain. Start with the allegation. Fill in the rest. Do not worry about the truth. Worry about the story.When the noise settles, the truth is small and human. A widow missing her husband. A woman who occasionally forgets her ring. A public hug meant as comfort. There is no conspiracy here. Only life happening in its messy, tender, inconvenient way.Yet three people were dragged through a podcast and reduced to plot points. Usha became the wrong kind of wife. Erika became the tempting “other woman.” JD became the protagonist of a love triangle that never existed.And this was said on a platform that presents itself as political thought.Imagine, for a moment, the mirror image. Imagine a conservative podcaster declaring that Michelle Obama was the “wrong kind of wife,” and that Barack Obama needed a “white queen” to be more acceptable to America. Imagine the outrage. Imagine the editorials. Imagine the rightly furious conversations about racism, misogyny and the dehumanisation of Black women.Now imagine what Usha Vance felt hearing her marriage framed the same way. This was not commentary. It was a small, callous story told with the confidence of someone who assumed there would be no consequences. It revealed how quickly empathy collapses when the woman in question does not belong to your political tribe.

Trump Questioned On Who Granted Asylum To DC Shooter





Trump administration on Friday ordered US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) officers to stop making all asylum decisions, following the shooting of two National Guard soldiers in Washington, DC.The pause comes after Wednesday’s attack, which officials say was carried out by an Afghan man who received asylum earlier this year. One of the soldiers has died. The suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, entered the US in 2021 under the Biden administration’s humanitarian parole programme and was granted asylum this spring.The order affects all nationalities and covers “affirmative” asylum cases handled by USCIS. Officers were told to continue interviews and case reviews, but stop at the point where a decision would normally be entered. In-person appointments scheduled for Monday, where applicants receive final decisions, were also cancelled.In a statement to CBS News, USCIS director Joe Edlow confirmed the decision. He said, ""USCIS has halted all asylum decisions until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible,"" Edlow said.""The safety of the American people always comes first.""The move is part of a wider set of immigration actions announced after the shooting. Earlier, the administration paused the processing of all legal immigration applications from Afghan nationals, including green cards, citizenship and work permits.USCIS has also begun a detailed review of green card cases involving people from 19 countries listed under a presidential proclamation issued in June.Late on Thursday, president Trump said he intended to “permanently pause migration from all third world countries.” He also said his administration would revoke the citizenship of those it considers a threat to “domestic tranquillity” and deport any foreign national viewed as a security risk or “non-compatible with Western civilisation.”","US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) officers to stop making all asylum decisions.

.





US president Donald Trump on Friday intervened in Honduras' politics by pardoning former president Juan Orlando Hernandez, just days before the country votes for a new president, and warned that US support to the country could be cut if his preferred candidate loses.Hernandez was convicted in a US court last year for drug trafficking and given a 45-year sentence. He governed Honduras from 2014 to 2022 and was accused by US prosecutors of helping move nearly 400 tonnes of cocaine into the United States. He was extradited soon after leaving office, when the current president, Xiomara Castro, took power.Trump’s announcement came through a social media post backing Nasry Asfura, the candidate from Hernandez’s right-wing party. Trump had already endorsed Asfura, but this time he went further, suggesting that future US aid depends on Asfura winning Sunday’s election.On Truth Social, Trump wrote, ""If he doesn't win, the United States will not be throwing good money after bad, because a wrong leader can only bring catastrophic results to a country, no matter which country it is."" He issued a similar warning before Argentina’s election last month.Asfura, a 67-year-old construction businessman and former mayor of Tegucigalpa, is in a close three-way race against leftist lawyer Rixi Moncada and right-wing TV host Salvador Nasralla.Trump accused Nasralla, 72, of acting as a spoiler who would split the right-wing vote. He pointed out that Nasralla previously served as Castro’s vice president before resigning, and claimed he is now “pretending” to be anti-Communist.Trump also criticised Moncada, calling her a “communist” and claiming her win would benefit Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro and “his Narcoterrorists.”The decision to pardon Hernández comes at a time when Washington is carrying out a large anti-drug operation in Latin America, where more than 80 people have been killed in strikes in international waters.A New York jury convicted Hernandez in March 2024 for helping move cocaine from Colombia and Venezuela into the United States since 2004, years before he became president. After his sentencing, former US attorney general Merrick Garland said Hernandez had abused his office to support a major drug-trafficking conspiracy.In his post on Friday, Trump said Hernández had been treated “very harshly and unfairly,” but did not explain further.","Hernandez was convicted in a US court last year for drug trafficking and given a 45-year sentence.

The US Treasury is moving to cut off federal benefits to ""illegal aliens"" and preserve them for US citizens, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Friday. The action is being taken at the direction of US President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly criticised current immigration policies in US.Treasury ""announced that it will issue proposed regulations clarifying that the refunded portions of certain individual income tax benefits are no longer available to illegal and other non-qualified aliens, covering the Earned Income Tax Credit, the Additional Child Tax Credit, the American Opportunity Tax Credit, and the Saver’s Match Credit,"" Bessent said on X.The announcement comes after a deadly attack earlier this week, when two members of the National Guard were shot by an Afghan national just blocks from the White House in Washington, DC. One of the victims died of injuries and one remains in critical condition.The shooter was identified as a 29-year-old Afghan national named Rahmatullah Lakanwal. He was wounded during the encounter and taken into custody. Investigation is ongoing with the help of various federal agencies even considering terror angles.According to CNN, the shooter had previous ties to US intelligence agencies, including the CIA, and was vetted to enter the US in 2021 after fleeing Afghanistan, where he had assisted American military against the Taliban.Bessent’s comments were made in response to a post by Donald Trump on Truth Social following the shooting, in which the US president himself vented out on current immigration policy.The MAGA chief announced a permanent pause on migration from “Third World countries,” including Afghan nationals. The pause also affects green card and asylum applications, as Trump’s team said it plans to review past admissions it considers “illegal” or unsafe.

What is an autopen?





US President Donald Trump on Friday said he is cancelling all executive orders signed by former President Joe Biden using an autopen and warned that Biden could face “charges of perjury” if he claims that staff were acting under his direction.The MAGA chief posted on Truth Social: “Any document signed by Sleepy Joe Biden with the Autopen, which was approximately 92% of them, is hereby terminated, and of no further force or effect. The Autopen is not allowed to be used if approval is not specifically given by the President of the United States.”Trump added: “The Radical Left Lunatics circling Biden around the beautiful Resolute Desk in the Oval Office took the Presidency away from him. I am hereby cancelling all Executive Orders, and anything else that was not directly signed by Crooked Joe Biden, because the people who operated the Autopen did so illegally. Joe Biden was not involved in the Autopen process and, if he says he was, he will be brought up on charges of perjury. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”Trump has long claimed that Biden was mostly absent during his four-year term and that unelected aides were running the country in place of him without proper authorisation.He has already revoked many of Biden’s executive orders and even suggested that some of his pardons may be invalid.The autopen is a mechanical device used to automate presidential signatures. It carries full legal force if staff are acting under the president’s directive. It has been used by chief executives for decades, including for routine proclamations, constituent letters, and, in rare cases, legislation.A House Republican investigation into Biden’s autopen use earlier this year found no direct evidence that aides acted without presidential approval, according to the New York Post. The inquiry found that Biden seldom met with key West Wing officials and there were internal concerns about how his verbally given instructions were being carried out, including crucial decisions on end-of-term clemency.",Donald Trump cancels all executive orders signed by Joe Biden using an autopen.

Their apartment was mostly empty, a neighbor told New York Post. There was no beds and only some cushions to sleep on. Lakanwal had a delivery driver job with Amazon Flex but as an independent contractor and was not working lately. His last delivery was recorded to be in August.

Donald Trump Jr. criticised the Wall Street Journal editorial board on Friday after the paper published an op-ed defending Afghan refugees living in the United States.The Journal’s editorial was titled “The Ambush on the National Guard.” It argued that Afghan refugees should not be blamed for the actions of a single individual.Recently, two National Guardsmen were shot by a suspected Afghan national, killing one of them and leaving one critically injured. The Trump administration halted all immigration requests from Afghan nationals and later extended the pause to include migration from all Third World countries.The WSJ piece said: ""The ambush of two West Virginia National Guard members near the White House Wednesday afternoon is horrifying on its own. But it arouses a particular anger because the alleged shooter is an Afghan man who was granted refuge in the US. after the Taliban takeover in 2021.""It added: “The alleged shooting by an Afghan ‘partner’ shouldn’t condemn all who assisted the US and now live here. Some will say this means the U.S. should never admit such refugees, but the alternative is abandoning allies who assist Americans in war to the retribution of our enemies.The fate of Afghans, men and women, who worked with the US has often been brutal. You can be sure Americans will fight overseas again, and our troops will need allies on the ground to succeed. How many will assist us if they believe there will be no exit for them if the US leaves with the enemy triumphant?”Trump Jr. responded on X: “Give me a f***ing break.

Trump Goes Nuclear On 3rd World Nations After National Guard Trooper Killed | ‘US Pausing Migration’





: In an explosive tirade following the death on Thursday of a National Guard soldier in a terrorist attack near the White House, US President Donald Trump vowed to “permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries,” launch mass deportations, and even denaturalize immigrants deemed incompatible with “Western Civilization” taking a country built on immigration into uncharted territory.In two angry posts on social media, Trump essayed a sweeping indictment of bipartisan U.S immigration policy of decades, using sketchy statistics to lay out the contours of a “reverse migration,” including revoking citizenship from those who “undermine domestic tranquility.”The President’s screed came even as the USCIS issued new guidelines to reevaluate green cards issued to people from 19 nations including Afghanistan, the country from which a former CIA conscript, Rahatullah Lakanwal, attacked two U.S military personnel three blocks from the White House on Wednesday, shooting them at close range. One of them, Sarah Brackman, 20, died in hospital on Thanksgiving, triggering the President into a furious rant on immigration.The other countries in the USCIS “blacklist”, which will consider new guidance allowing for negative, country-specific factors to be considered when vetting foreigners, include Burma, Somalia, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Sudan, Yemen, Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.Taken with the President’s warning on social media, the new guidelines, which may be implemented through executive order if it cannot be legislated, will go far beyond Trump’s first-term travel ban on several majority-Muslim nations, representing the most sweeping immigration restriction in modern American history.Trump anchored his case against immigration in a series of dodgy statistical assertions, including claiming most of the 53 million foreign born population in the US “are on welfare, from failed nations, or from prisons, mental institutions, gangs, or drug cartels.” He also claimed that a green-card holder earning $30,000 receives “roughly $50,000 in yearly benefits for their family.”The assertion that “most” immigrants are on welfare or come from criminal backgrounds has been repeatedly debunked in all but extreme MAGA circles which cotton on to stray cases. Undocumented immigrants are ineligible for nearly all federal benefits, and legal immigrants face a five-year waiting period for programs such as Medicaid and SNAP (food stamps). A 2024 Congressional Budget Office report found that immigrants as a whole contribute $1.6 trillion more in taxes than they consume over a 75-year horizon when second- and third-generation effects are included. In fact, studies have shown the US needs immigration to keep its social security programs solvent.But Trump maintained that even as the US has progressed technologically, immigration policy has eroded those gains and living conditions for many. “I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the US. system to fully recover, terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions… and remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States, or is incapable of loving our Country, end all Federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens of our Country, denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility, and deport any Foreign National who is a public charge, security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilization….Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation,” he wrote.The President singled out the state of Minnesota, which has a prominent Somali community due to resettlement going back to the Clinton era after the civil war in that country. He alleged that “hundreds of thousands of refugees from Somalia are completely taking over” the state causing social dysfunction, with “Somalian gangs… roving the streets” while residents cower behind locked doors.Demographers place the Somali-ancestry population between 64,000 and 80,000, and while there is documented gang violence involving a small sub-set of Somali-American youth – like with Canadian Sikhs in Vancouver – their entrepreneurship has contributed significantly to the local economy.Trump reserved particular venom for Minnesota's Democratic Governor Tim Walz, whom he called “seriously retarded,” and Somali-American Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, whom he accused of entering the country illegally by marrying her brother and of hating America. The brother-marriage allegation, first aired by anonymous online posters in 2016, was investigated by Minnesota journalists and found to rest on mistaken identity and forged documents; no charges were ever filed. Omar, who arrived as a child refugee in 1992 and was naturalized in 2000, is one of three Muslim women currently serving in Congress.","USCIS issued new guidelines to reevaluate green cards issued to people from 19 nations including Afghanistan, the country from which a former CIA conscript, Rahatullah Lakanwal, attacked two U.S military personnel three blocks from the White House on Wednesday.

‘Hitler-era repression’: Imran Khan’s sister slams jail treatment; family barred from meetings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/hitler-era-repression-imran-khans-sister-slams-jail-treatment-family-barred-from-meetings/articleshow/125623777.cms,"'Darkest Times': Imran Khan's Sister Calls Out Pakistan Govt, Compares Asim Munir To Adolf Hitler





Imran Khan’s sister, Noreen Niazi, has criticized Pakistani authorities over the treatment of the former prime minister in prison, warning that his family has been kept completely in the dark and that “no one knows what’s happening inside the jail. ”Speaking to ANI about her last meeting with the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder, she said, “...He is going through a tough time alone. He is in isolation... As per the jail manual, one can't be placed in isolation for more than 4 days. But he was put in isolation for three weeks last year as well, during which electricity was switched off, and he wasn't even allowed to read books. The same has been done now.”Her remarks come amid a surge of rumours about Khan’s health, fuelled by the month-long blackout on family and legal meetings. “We don't know anything. They are not telling us anything, nor are they letting anybody meet him,” she said, adding that even party members with a scheduled meeting had been blocked from entering.“We have not been allowed to meet him for the last four weeks... The Police have been ordered to stop us and, I believe, also given permission to do to us whatever they want. This has never happened in Pakistan before.”Niazi described the treatment of supporters and family members outside Adiala Jail as unprecedented.“No one has ever disrespected women like this, nor has anyone been oppressed this way. This is the first time in Pakistan that these people have been allowed to beat up people like there won't be any consequences, without considering if it's a child, an elderly person, or a woman in front of them. The world is aware of what's happening in Pakistan. ”She said Pakistan had entered its “darkest period”, comparing the situation to “Hitler-era-like repression”. According to her, people are being “killed, beaten, and jailed without accountability”. The continued ban on meetings, she argues, is deliberate. “We have been going there for the last four weeks, and they are not letting us meet him. This is why such rumours are spreading.”Public anger, she warned, is reaching a breaking point. “I believe there will be a spark among people soon, and then they will see the level to which the people go... The oppression is too much.”Her comments come as PTI leaders, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, continue to be denied access to Khan, who has been held since August 2023. While Adiala Jail officials insist he is in “completely good health”, the lack of transparency has only intensified demands for a clear and verifiable update on his condition.","Noreen Niazi says family has been kept in the dark about Imran Khan's condition.

As Pakistan Halts Afghan Transit, Kabul Boosts India Partnership And Fast-Tracks The Chabahar Route





The UAE has stopped issuing visas to Pakistani nationals and only narrowly held back from imposing a complete ban on the Pakistani passport, a senior Pakistani interior ministry official told a parliamentary panel on Thursday.Pakistan’s additional interior secretary Salman Chaudhry informed the Senate Functional Committee on Human Rights that both the UAE and Saudi Arabia had “stopped short of imposing a ban on the Pakistani passport,” as reported by Dawn.“If a ban is imposed, getting it removed would be difficult,” Chaudhry said.Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri, who chairs the Senate human rights committee, confirmed the interior ministry official’s account in comments to the paper.She said the travel restrictions stemmed from concerns about individuals visiting the UAE and “getting involved in criminal activities”.According to her, the committee was informed that the UAE had largely stopped issuing visas to Pakistani nationals, and that only a limited number had been granted recently, and “after much difficulty”.A Pakistani blue passport is an official travel document reserved for government officials and other eligible personnel, distinguishing it from the standard green passport issued to ordinary citizens.Meanwhile, UAE Ambassador to Pakistan Salem M Salem Al Bawab Al Zaabi briefed Pakistan's finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Thursday about “major UAE visa facilitation reforms for Pakistanis,” according to a statement from the minister’s office.The statement added that nearly 500 visas were being processed daily at the newly launched UAE Visa Centre in Pakistan, outlining the reforms highlighted by the envoy.Pakistan and the UAE maintain longstanding diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties. The Gulf nation is among Pakistan’s largest trading partners in the region and a key source of remittances, supported by a sizeable Pakistani workforce residing there.However, Pakistani nationals experienced a surge in visa rejections in early July, prompting interior minister Mohsin Naqvi to take up the matter with his UAE counterpart.","The UAE has stopped issuing visas to Pakistani nationals, a senior Pakistani interior ministry official told a parliamentary panel on Thursday.
