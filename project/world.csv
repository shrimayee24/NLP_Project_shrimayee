But, we took students into confidence who revealed everything, he said.Bishnoi said, one of the students of madrasa was sexually abused by Mahir. When he threatened to reveal everything, Mahir lured him with money. Disturbed with regular his harassment, students decided to murder Mahir. They beat him severely with a stick and strangulated him to death with a rope, he said.Bishnoi said that students told police that they were upset with regular sexual abuse of a student by Mahir. “Two days before the murder, Mahir had returned from his village in UP. The students bought sleeping pills from a medical shop on April 26, but Mahir dad dinner outside. When he returned, students gave him curd with pills. After some time, Maulana went to sleep. Students went to the storeroom and brought a stick and rope. When he was sleeping, they hit his head with the stick. He tried to stand up, but they put the rope around his neck and strangulated him. He then went unconscious. They left the room after checking that his heartbeat has stopped.”Later, Tosif Ashraf of the mosque filed a complaint and police detained six minors.","Ajmer police on Sunday detained six minor students of a madrasa for allegedly killing imam of Mohammadi Masjid.

‘Unity Intifada’: The 'toolkit' behind pro-Palestine protests on US campuses,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/unity-intifada-the-toolkit-behind-pro-palestine-protests-on-us-campuses/articleshow/110059395.cms,"NEW DELHI: In the aftermath of Hamas's violent rampage through Israel on October 7, National Students for Justice in Palestine ( NSJP ), a leading anti-Israel campus organization in the United States, quickly mobilized to promote a "" unity intifada "" across American colleges . This movement, described in a strategic document obtained by the Washington Free Beacon, aims to support and ""normalize"" terrorist actions against Israel through coordinated protests and educational events.The group's preparedness and immediate response suggest a premeditated plan to leverage campus networks to amplify pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel sentiment nationally.The toolkit includes directives for ""a sit-in, disruption, or educational event"" and highlights NSJP’s encouragement of campus actions that defend and ""normalize the resistance"" against Israel. These activities, as per the toolkit, are part of a global ""unity intifada"" in which Palestinian students consider themselves active participants rather than mere supporters. The document explicitly positions Palestinian students as integral members of a global resistance movement rather than mere allies. This framing has prompted serious allegations in a recent landmark lawsuit filed by Israeli victims of the Hamas terror attack, accusing NSJP and its parent organization, American Muslims for Palestine (AMP), of providing material support to Hamas. The plaintiffs argue that the toolkit and the activities it promotes serve as a direct aid to Hamas's propaganda and recruitment efforts on US soil, the Washington Free Beacon report said.The swift assembly and dissemination of the NSJP's ""day of resistance"" toolkit, just one day following the Hamas attacks , have drawn congressional attention and judicial scrutiny. Representative Tom Emmer highlighted the depth of the students' involvement, criticizing their alignment with Hamas's objectives. The case not only questions the legality of NSJP's and AMP's actions but also raises broader concerns about the influence of foreign conflicts on American university campuses. As these events unfold, they reveal the complex interplay between free speech, academic freedom, and national security concerns, especially when domestic organizations are perceived as extensions of foreign militant groups.The toolkit itself advocates for what it describes as a righteous resistance against Israeli occupation, urging students to engage in actions that challenge Zionist presence and promote Palestinian liberation narratives. It even goes as far as justifying attacks on Israeli civilians by disputing their status under international law, a stance that has exacerbated accusations against NSJP of inciting violence and supporting terrorism. The ongoing legal and political fallout from NSJP's campaign continues to stir debate on how US institutions and government entities should respond to campus groups that align themselves with internationally recognized terrorist organizations.","National Students for Justice in Palestine (NSJP) quickly mobilized to promote a "" unity intifada "" across American colleges.

Flash floods and cold lava flow hit Indonesia's Sumatra island; at least 37 killed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/flash-floods-and-cold-lava-flow-hit-indonesias-sumatra-island-at-least-37-killed/articleshow/110063539.cms,"PADANG: Heavy rains and torrents of cold lava and mud flowing down a volcano 's slopes on Indonesia 's Sumatra island triggered flash floods that killed at least 37 people and more than a dozen others were missing, officials said Sunday. Monsoon rains and a major mudslide from a cold lava flow on Mount Marapi caused a river to breach its banks and tear through mountainside villages in four districts in West Sumatra province just before midnight on Saturday.The floods swept away people and submerged more than 100 houses and buildings, National Disaster Management Agency spokesperson Abdul Muhari said.Cold lava, also known as lahar, is a mixture of volcanic material and pebbles that flow down a volcano's slopes in the rain.By Sunday afternoon, rescuers had pulled out 19 bodies in the worst-hit village of Canduang in Agam district and recovered nine other bodies in the neighboring district of Tanah Datar, the National Search and Rescue Agency said in a statement.The agency said that eight bodies were pulled from mud during deadly flash floods that also hit Padang Pariaman, and one body was found in the city of Padang Panjang. It said rescuers are searching for 18 people who are reportedly missing.Flash floods on Saturday night also caused main roads around the Anai Valley Waterfall area in Tanah Datar district to be blocked by mud, cutting off access to other cities, Padang Panjang Police Chief Kartyana Putra said Sunday.Videos released by the National Search and Rescue Agency showed roads that were transformed into murky brown rivers.The disaster came just two months after heavy rains triggered flash floods and a landslide in West Sumatra's Pesisir Selatan and Padang Pariaman districts, killing at least 21 people and leaving five others missing.The 2,885-metre (9,465-foot) Mount Marapi erupted late last year killing 23 climbers who were caught by a surprise weekend eruption. The volcano has stayed at the third highest of four alert levels since 2011, indicating above-normal volcanic activity under which climbers and villagers must stay more than 3 km (about 2 miles) from the peak, according to Indonesia's Centre for Volcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation.Marapi is known for sudden eruptions that are difficult to predict because the source is shallow and near the peak, and its eruptions aren't caused by a deep movement of magma, which sets off tremors that register on seismic monitors.Marapi has been active since an eruption in January 2023 that caused no casualties. It is among more than 120 active volcanoes in Indonesia. The country is prone to seismic upheaval because of its location on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"", an arc of volcanoes and fault lines encircling the Pacific Basin.",Monsoon rains and a major mudslide from a cold lava flow on Mount Marapi caused a river to breach its banks.

UK foreign secretary says halting arms sales to Israel would only strengthen Hamas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uk-foreign-secretary-says-halting-arms-sales-to-israel-would-only-strengthen-hamas/articleshow/110063778.cms,"LONDON: Halting arms exports to Israel is ""not a wise path"" and would only strengthen Hamas , Britain's foreign secretary said Sunday. Asked whether the UK would follow the US in threatening to cut the supply of offensive weapons to Israel if it carried out an attack on the southern Gaza city of Rafah , Foreign Secretary David Cameron said the two countries cannot be compared because unlike the US, Britain supplies a very small amount of Israel's weapons.""The UK provides less than 1% of Israel's weapons and it's not a state supplier,"" Cameron told the BBC on Sunday. ""We have a licensing system and those licences can be closed if it's judged there's a serious risk of a serious international human rights violation.""US President Joe Biden has said that his government will stop supplying weapons and artillery to Israel if its forces launch an all-out assault on Rafah, the last major Hamas stronghold in Gaza.Britain's opposition Labour Party and human rights groups have argued that the UK should follow a similar position and stop the sale of British-made weapons or components in a Rafah offensive.The US government said Friday that Israel's use of US-provided weapons in Gaza likely violated international humanitarian law . But it added that wartime conditions prevented US officials from determining that for certain in specific airstrikes.Cameron said the UK did not support a major offensive in Rafah without a clear plan about how civilians can be protected.The Campaign Against Arms Trade nonprofit group estimates that the real value of UK arms exports of Israel is at least 1 billion pounds since 2015, much higher than government figures.It says that British industry, namely BAE Systems, provides about 15% of the components in the F-35 stealth combat aircraft used by Israel. The group alleges that the jets were used in recent bombardment of Gaza. The full value of component and other licenses is not known, it said.Cameron also said that putting British boots on the ground in Gaza as part of international efforts to deliver aid would be ""a risk that we shouldn't take"".His comments came after reports that UK authorities were considering deploying troops to land humanitarian supplies from a temporary pier being built by the US military.Cameron said that his government's view was that ""actually putting British boots on to the beach was not a good move."" He said that instead, the aid delivery will likely be carried out by a contractor.","Foreign Secretary David Cameron says the UK supplies less than 1% of Israel's weapons.

The Saudi ministers, seemingly, have convinced the crown prince that political situation in Pakistan is not stable, tensions run high between the military and jailed ex-PM Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), and it would be unwise for him to visit the country in the current situation,” said Shehbaz Gill , a PTI functionary and Imran’s former principal staff officer.Last month, PTI functionary Sher Afzal Marwat had alleged that Saudi Arabia was a “conduit” in the US-led operation to oust Imran’s govt in April 2022. Following his claim, PTI removed him from its core and political committee, also issuing a show-cause for trying to harm relations with Saudi Arabia.Recently, Marwat blamed the “Saudi influence” for his party dropping his name for chairmanship of public accounts committee (PAC) of parliament.While foreign ministry spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said the revised schedule of the visit is still being worked out, govt sources maintained that there were some points on the economic front that still needed to be cleared between both sides before MBS finalised his tour.They said Saudi investors and businessmen, who recently toured Pakistan, are interested in some projects but the terms of the agreement have not yet been finalised.PM Shehbaz Sharif had extended an invitation to the crown prince to visit Pakistan during his official tour to Saudi Arabia. The two sides were expected to sign a number of MoUs during the visit, as Pakistan is hoping for a huge investment package from the oil-rich kingdom.MBS had earlier cancelled his visit to Pakistan in Nov 2022.

According to an official IAEA measurement, if the existing nuclear material is further enriched, it would be adequate for producing two nuclear weapons.","Kamal Kharrazi, an adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was quoted as saying.

The disputed territory experienced clashes on Saturday between the police and activists of a rights movement, coinciding with a wheel-jam and shutter-down strike across the region, as reported by the Dawn newspaper.Mirpur Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Kamran Ali informed Dawn.com that sub-inspector Adnan Qureshi succumbed to a gunshot wound in the chest while deployed with other police personnel in the town of Islamgarh to prevent a rally headed towards Muzaffarabad via Kotli and Poonch districts, organized by the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC).In the days leading up to the planned long march towards Muzaffarabad on Saturday, around 70 JAAC activists were arrested by police during raids at their residences and those of their relatives in Muzaffarabad and Mirpur divisions, sparking serious clashes in Dadyal on Thursday. The committee subsequently called for a shutter-down and wheel-jam strike on Friday.Amidst a crippling strike on Friday, violent clashes erupted between police and protesters in various areas of Muzaffarabad, the capital of PoK. On Saturday, authorities placed mounds of earth on arteries leading to Muzaffarabad and made additional arrests to prevent people from reaching the state capital.SSP Yasin Baig stated that at least one police officer and a young boy were injured as police resorted to teargas shelling and aerial firing in some neighborhoods after protesters pelted stones and bottles. Kotli SSP Mir Muhammad Abid reported that at least 78 policemen were injured in the district during ""attacks of miscreants under the guise of protest .""According to a press release from the District Headquarters Hospital Kotli, apart from the 59 wounded policemen, nine injured protesters were also brought in for treatment. SSP Abid mentioned that some police officials were also reportedly injured in Doliya Jattan.""The government held negotiations with the Awami Action Committee (AAC) and we reached to an agreement which we are determined to implement,"" Geo News quoted Haq as saying.","One police officer was killed and over 100 individuals, primarily law enforcement personnel, sustained injuries during confrontations between security forces and demonstrators.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urgently appealed for military aid as Ukrainian troops engage in counterattacks to thwart Russian advances.Moscow's defense ministry announced the ""liberation"" of five villages in Kharkiv near the Russian border, along with the seizure of one village in the Donetsk region.This offensive follows Russia's reported incursion into the Kharkiv region, marking small advancements into a border zone from which it had been repelled nearly two years ago.President Zelenskyy, in a televised address, emphasized the imperative of disrupting Russian offensive plans, labeling it as the country's top priority. Heavy fighting has been reported in the border area, prompting the evacuation of 1,775 individuals. Tragically, two men were killed and two others wounded by guided aerial bomb attacks in the town of Vovchansk.Despite assurances from Kharkiv regional governor Oleg Synegubov that there is currently no imminent ground operation threat to the city of Kharkiv, residents from border areas have fled in fear. Evacuees, many of whom are elderly, have sought refuge at reception centers near Kharkiv, receiving essential assistance.The situation remains precarious, with aid workers highlighting the challenges of evacuating residents amid ongoing troop movements and heightened danger. Zelenskyy reiterated the urgent need for international support, stressing the importance of timely arms deliveries to bolster Ukrainian defenses.Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces have intensified attacks inside Russia and Russia-held territories, targeting energy infrastructure. In a retaliatory strike, a missile hit a restaurant in the Russian-held city of Donetsk, claiming three lives and injuring several others.Analysts speculate that Russia's ground operation aims to establish a buffer zone near its Belgorod region or divert Ukrainian resources from the Donetsk region. Despite Washington's announcement of a $400 million military aid package for Ukraine and assurances of its capability to repel fresh Russian campaigns, the situation on the ground remains volatile.","Moscow's defense ministry announced the ""liberation"" of five villages in Kharkiv near the Russian border.

At least 18 others are injured. We are also still searching for 16 other people,"" West Sumatra disaster agency spokesman Ilham Wahab told AFP.The rescue operation, comprising local responders, law enforcement, military personnel, and volunteers, is tirelessly ongoing.The flash floods and cold lava flow hit Agam and Tanah Datar districts around 10:30 pm (1530 GMT) on Saturday, as reported by Basarnas search and rescue agency. Cold lava, or lahar, composed of volcanic ash, sand, and stones, descended the slopes of Mount Marapi due to the heavy rain.Earlier reports from Basarnas had accounted for 12 fatalities, including children. Ilham mentioned that reports of missing individuals are continuously coming in from concerned relatives.Damage assessment reveals mosques, residences, and public infrastructure wrecked by the disaster. In Tanah Datar, a tourist hotspot named Lembah Anai witnessed severe road damage, cutting off access between Padang and Bukittinggi. Meanwhile, in Agam, numerous homes and facilities suffered destruction.Authorities have mobilized rescue teams and boats to locate missing persons and facilitate evacuations to shelters. Evacuation centers and emergency posts have been established across Agam and Tanah Datar districts.Indonesia's susceptibility to landslides and floods during the rainy season is well-known. In March, West Sumatra faced a similar tragedy, claiming at least 26 lives. Additionally, environmentalists attribute deforestation, primarily due to logging, as a significant exacerbating factor in such disasters, emphasizing the protective role of trees against flooding.Mount Marapi's recent eruption in December resulted in a towering ash column reaching 3,000 meters (9,800 feet) into the sky.

Pro-Palestinian protests dwindle to tiny numbers and subtle defiant acts at US college graduations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pro-palestinian-protests-dwindle-to-tiny-numbers-and-subtle-defiant-acts-at-us-college-graduations/articleshow/110065368.cms,"A tiny contingent of Duke University graduates opposed pro-Israel comedian Jerry Seinfeld speaking at their commencement in North Carolina Sunday, with about 30 of the 7,000 students leaving their seats and chanting “free Palestine” amid a mix of boos and cheers.Some waved the red, green, black and white Palestinian flag. Seinfeld, whose decade-long namesake show became one of the most popular in U.S.television history and who continues to draw legions of fans to his Netflix specials and TV appearances such as “Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,” was there to receive an honorary doctorate from the university.“After spending four years at what is considered one of the finest institutions of higher education in the world, they apparently feel that perhaps some light entertainment will get you all to the final realization, ‘You know, I think I’ve really had enough of this place,’” Seinfeld said.The stand-up turned actor and recent star, director and co-writer of the movie “Unfrosted,” has publicly supported Israel since it invaded Gaza to dismantle Hamas after the organization attacked the country and killed some 1,200 people in southern Israel on Oct. 7. The ensuing war has killed nearly 35,000 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants.Students at campuses across the U.S. responded this spring by setting up encampments and calling for their schools to cut ties with Israel and businesses that support it. Students and others on campuses whom law enforcement authorities have identified as outside agitators have taken part in the protests from Columbia University in New York City to UCLA.At the University of California, Berkeley, on Saturday, a small group of pro-Palestinian demonstrators waved flags and chanted during commencement and were escorted to the back of the stadium, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. There were no major counterprotests, but some attendees voiced frustration.“I feel like they’re ruining it for those of us who paid for tickets and came to show our pride for our graduates,” said Annie Ramos, whose daughter is a student. “There’s a time and a place, and this is not it.”The small student protest Sunday at Duke's graduation in Durham, North Carolina, was emblematic of campus events across the U.S. Sunday after weeks of student protests roiled U.S. campuses in recent weeks and resulted in nearly 2,900 arrests at 57 colleges and universities.This weekend's commencement events remained largely peaceful.At Emerson College in Boston, some students took off their graduation robes and left them on stage. Others emblazoned “free Palestine” on their mortar boards. One woman, staring at a camera broadcasting a livestream to the public, unzipped her robe to show a kaffiyeh, the black and white checkered scarf commonly worn by Palestinians, and flashed a watermelon painted on her hand. Both are symbols of solidarity with those living in the occupied territories.Others displayed messages for a camera situated on stage, but the livestream quickly shifted to a different view, preventing them from being seen for long. Chants during some of the speeches were difficult to decipher.Protests at Columbia University, where student uprisings inspired others at campuses across the country, led the school to cancel its main graduation ceremony in favor of smaller gatherings.The University of Southern California told its valedictorian, who publicly backed Palestinians, that she could not deliver her keynote speech at its graduation ceremony because of security concerns. It later canceled its main graduation ceremony.At Depaul University in Chicago, graduation is more than a month away. But as the academic year closes, school leaders said they had reached an “impasse” with the school's pro-Palestinian protesters, leaving the future of their encampment on the Chicago campus unclear.The student-led DePaul Divestment Coalition, which is calling on the university to divest from economic interests tied to Israel, set up the encampment nearly two weeks ago. The group alleged university officials walked away from talks and tried to force students into signing an agreement, according to a student statement late Saturday.","About 30 of the 7,000 students left their seats and chanted 'free Palestine' amid a mix of boos and cheers.

In a pair of TV interviews, Blinken underscored that the United States believes Israeli forces should ""get out of Gaza"", but also is waiting to see credible plans from Israel for security and governance in the territory after the war.Hamas has reemerged in parts of Gaza, Blinken said, and that ""heavy action"" by Israeli forces in the southern city of Rafah risks leaving America's closest Mideast ally ""holding the bag on an enduring insurgency"".He said the United States has worked with Arab countries and others for weeks on developing ""credible plans for security, for governance, for rebuilding"" in Gaza, but ""we haven't seen that come from Israel...We need to see that, too"".Blinken also said that as Israel pushes deeper in Rafah in the south, where Israel says Hamas has four battalions and where more than 1 million civilians have massed, a military operation may ""have some initial success"" but risks ""terrible harm"" to the population without solving a problem ""that both of us want to solve, which is making sure Hamas cannot again govern Gaza"".Israel's conduct of the war, he said, has put the country ""on the trajectory, potentially, to inherit an insurgency with many armed Hamas left or, if it leaves, a vacuum filled by chaos, filled by anarchy, and probably refilled by Hamas. We've been talking to them about a much better way of getting an enduring result, enduring security"".Blinken also echoed for the first time publicly by a US official the findings of a new Biden administration report to Congress on Friday that said Israel's use of US-provided weapons in Gaza likely violated international humanitarian law. The report also said wartime conditions prevented American officials from determining that for certain in specific airstrikes.""When it comes to the use of weapons, concerns about incidents where given the totality of the damage that's been done to children, women, men, it was reasonable to assess that, in certain instances, Israel acted in ways that are not consistent with international humanitarian law,"" Blinken said. He cited ""the horrible loss of life of innocent civilians"".The war began on Oct 7 after an attack against Israel by Hamas that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians. About 250 people were taken hostage. Israel's offensive has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry in Gaza.US and UN officials say Israeli restrictions on food shipments since Oct 7 have brought on full-fledged famine in northern Gaza.Tensions between Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about how the war, as well as domestic tensions about US support for Israel with protests on US college campuses and many Republican lawmakers saying that Biden needs to give Israel whatever it needs. The issue could play a major role in the outcome of November's presidential election.Biden said in an interview last week with CNN that his administration would not provide weapons that Israel could use for an all-out assault in Rafah.Blinken appeared on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" and NBC's ""Meet the Press"".","Secretary of State Antony Blinken delivered some of the Biden administration's strongest public criticism yet of Israel's conduct of the war in Gaza.

Yawns and shock: Trump's odd mix of song recitals and cannibal praise,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/yawns-and-shock-trumps-odd-mix-of-song-recitals-and-cannibal-praise/articleshow/110048537.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Former US president Donald Trump surprised his supporters at a rally in New Jersey on Saturday by reciting the entire 1963 soul song ""The Snake"" and referring to a fictional cannibal as ""great."" During his speech, which lasted over 90 minutes, Trump used the Oscar Brown song to draw a comparison with "" illegal immigration and how stupid it is what we're doing right now.""""We're letting people come into our country that we will only be trouble,"" he said.Trump expressed his concern about allowing people into the country who he believes will only cause trouble. He recited the song, which tells the story of a tenderhearted woman who helps a half-frozen snake, only to be bitten by the snake instead of being thanked. Trump has used this song multiple times to highlight his anti-migrant stance, despite reported objections from Brown's family.The crowd's reaction to the lengthy recitation was subdued, with some looking puzzled and others leaving the rally. Trump awkwardly remarked, ""Did everybody enjoy it? Don't enjoy, you should be -- you should be scared!"" speaking off-the-cuff after reading from a crib sheet in his jacket pocket.Trump's rhetoric surrounding the migrant crisis has become increasingly violent, with him claiming just months ago that migrants were ""poisoning the blood"" of the United States, sparking a fierce backlash. Biden's campaign accused him of imitating Hitler's language, and during his first presidential campaign in 2016, Trump shocked observers with his language about ""rapist"" illegal migrants, reported AFP.Trump also made a rambling reference to cannibalism, saying, ""The late, great Hannibal Lecter is a wonderful man,"" referencing the 1991 film ""Silence of the Lambs."" He then grinned and rehashed a well-worn joke about the infamous cannibal character before returning to the topic of migration, stating, ""But Hannibal Lecter. Congratulations, the late, great Hannibal Lecter. We have people that are being released into our country that we don't want in our country.""","Former US president Donald Trump surprised his supporters at a rally in New Jersey.

"How is Pakistan buying fighter jets, submarines despite the economic crisis?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/how-is-pakistan-buying-fighter-jets-submarines-despite-the-economic-crisis/articleshow/110059597.cms,"Despite facing a dire economic situation with a foreign debt totaling $124.5 billion, equivalent to 42% of its GDP, Pakistan is persistently expanding its military capabilities, notably through substantial arms imports and collaborations with China. A report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) indicates that between 2019 and 2023, China accounted for 82% of Pakistan’s arms imports, reflecting a deepening military relationship between the two nations.""China is strongly contributing to the strengthening of Pakistan’s military by providing fighter jets, warships, missile technology, drones, etc.This is part of China’s strategy to counter the influence and power of Quad-4 (that includes India) and the West’s other regional alliances,"" an opinion piece in the EurAsian Times said.During President Xi Jinping’s 2015 visit to Pakistan, a significant agreement was forged for China to construct eight Hangor-class submarines for Pakistan, enhancing its naval power. ""The submarines will play a pivotal role in maintaining peace and stability in the region. It would add a new dimension to the ever-tested Pakistan-China friendship,” said Admiral Naveed Ashraf, Pakistani Chief of Naval Staff. This deal is part of China's broader strategy to counterbalance the influence of the Quad alliance and Western powers in the region.Amidst this backdrop of military enhancement, Pakistan grapples with an acute economic crisis , exacerbated by last year's devastating floods which led to a severe reduction in the GDP growth projection from 5% to 0.29%. The financial strain is further highlighted by a comment from the Business Standard, noting, ""Pakistan has no food for its people but purchases weapons."" The national budget reflects a 15.4% increase in defense spending, totaling 1804 billion rupees, even as the nation contends with skyrocketing inflation and widespread poverty.The economic hardships have led to public discontent, with Pakistani media reporting severe shortages of basic necessities such as food and medicines. Many believe that the real power in Pakistan lies with the military, which commands a significant portion of the national budget and operates vast revenue-generating enterprises. This perception is reinforced by international discussions, such as those held by the IMF, which highlight the disproportionate allocation of resources to the military at the expense of civil needs, the EurAsian Times report said.Adding to the controversy, recent reports from the BBC and other media outlets have suggested that despite Pakistan’s official stance of neutrality in the Ukraine conflict, there have been covert operations involving the supply of arms to Ukraine. These reports allege that under American pressure, Pakistan engaged in secret deals that not only violated its declared neutrality but also provided substantial profits from arms sales.","Pakistan is persistently expanding its military capabilities, notably through substantial arms imports and collaborations with China.

The HRCP demanded economic justice and protection of civil rights and stressed the importance of upholding democratic principles and the rule of law.In its annual report, 'State of Human Rights 2023', released on Wednesday, the HRCP noted with concern that irreparable political divisions led to public acts of arson and violence on May 9, 2023, after the arrest of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan.""What followed was flagrant disregard for the Constitution as unelected forces tightened their grip on the country's democratic structures and civic spaces shrank to an all-time low,"" the report read, according to Dawn.According to the report, the state's response to the May 9 riots was to quell dissent by resurrecting military courts to try civilians, perpetrating enforced disappearances, ordering mass arrests and allegedly orchestrating public disassociation from the PTI among many senior party leaders.The report noted that the right to freedom of expression and assembly took a particular hit during the year. According to the report, the rule of law was poor, with six-year high in fatalities related to terrorist attacks and counter-terrorism operations.

More than 300 dead in Afghanistan flash floods: WFP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/more-than-300-dead-in-afghanistan-flash-floods-wfp/articleshow/110042646.cms,"- State of emergency -

LAQAYI: More than 300 people were killed in flash floods that ripped through multiple Afghan provinces, the UN's World Food Programme said Saturday, as authorities declared a state of emergency and rushed to rescue the injured.Heavy rains on Friday sent roaring rivers of water and mud crashing through villages and across agricultural land in several provinces.Survivors on Saturday picked through muddy, debris-littered streets and damaged buildings, an AFP journalist saw, as authorities and non-governmental groups deployed rescue workers and aid, warning that some areas had been cut off by the flooding.Northern Baghlan province was one of the hardest hit, with more than 300 people killed there alone, and thousands of houses destroyed or damaged, according to WFP.""On current information: in Baghlan province there are 311 fatalities, 2,011 houses destroyed and 2,800 houses damaged,"" Rana Deraz, a communications officer for the United Nations agency in Afghanistan , told AFP.There were disparities between the death tolls provided by the government and humanitarian agencies.The UN's International Organization for Migration said there were 218 deaths in Baghlan.Abdul Mateen Qani, spokesman for the interior ministry, told AFP that 131 people had been killed in Baghlan, but that the government toll could rise.""Many people are still missing,"" he said.Another 20 people were reported dead in northern Takhar province and two in neighbouring Badakhshan, he added. Taliban government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said, ""Hundreds of our fellow citizens have succumbed to these calamitous floods"", in a statement posted to social media site X earlier on Saturday.""Moreover, the deluge has wrought extensive devastation upon residential properties, resulting in significant financial losses,"" he added.Rains on Friday caused heavy damage in Baghlan, Takhar and Badakhshan, as well as western Ghor and Herat provinces, officials said, in a country wracked by poverty and heavily dependent on agriculture.""My house and my whole life was swept away by the flood,"" said Jan Mohammad Din Mohammad, a resident of Baghlan provincial capital Pul-e-Khumri.His family had managed to flee to higher ground but when the weather cleared and they returned home, ""there was nothing left, all my belongings and my house had been destroyed"", he said.""I don't know where to take my family... I don't know what to do.""Emergency personnel were rushing to rescue injured and stranded people, according to the defence ministry.The ministry ordered multiple branches of the military ""to provide any kind of assistance to the victims of this incident with all available resources"".The air force said it had started evacuation operations as the weather cleared on Saturday, adding that more than 100 injured people had been transferred to hospital, without specifying from which provinces.""By announcing the state of emergency in (affected) areas, the Ministry of National Defense has started distributing food, medicine and first aid to the impacted people,"" it said.An AFP journalist saw a vehicle laden with food and water in Baghlan's Baghlan-i-Markazi district, as well as others carrying the dead to be buried.Since mid-April, flash flooding and other floods had left about 100 people dead in 10 of Afghanistan's provinces, with no region entirely spared, according to authorities.Farmland has been swamped in a country where 80 percent of the more than 40 million people depend on agriculture to survive.Afghanistan -- which had a relatively dry winter, making it more difficult for the soil to absorb rainfall -- is highly vulnerable to climate change .The nation, ravaged by four decades of war, is one of the poorest in the world and, according to scientists, one of the worst prepared to face the consequences of global warming.The UN special rapporteur for human rights in Afghanistan, Richard Bennett, said on X the floods were ""a stark reminder of Afghanistan's vulnerability to the #climatecrisis"".""Both immediate aid and long term planning by the #Taliban & international actors are needed.""Mohammed Khater, deputy head of the UN's humanitarian affairs office in Afghanistan, said the high toll was due in part to people living near waterways, and that deaths were common during the seasonal rains.""This is an everyday incident during this season, the rainy season,"" Khater told AFP.","More than 300 people killed in flash floods that ripped through Afghan provinces. Heavy rains on Friday sent roaring rivers of water and mud crashing through villages. Northern Baghlan province was one of the hardest hit, with more than 300 dead. Thousands of houses destroyed or damaged, according to WFP.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110042651,imgsize-1395324,width-400,resizemode-4/110042651.jpg"
