"Strongroom was breached, papers photographed hours before NEET: CBI",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/strongroom-was-breached-papers-photographed-hours-before-neet-cbi/articleshow/111969954.cms,"NEW DELHI: CBI reached members of NEET-UG question paper leak gang by the providential recovery by Bihar Police of a partly burnt leaked question paper, which was a printout of a mobile phone photo of the question paper taken five hours before the examination on May 5 at Oasis School in Hazaribag.Explaining the modus operandi adopted by the gang which hatched the conspiracy to leak the question paper 2-3 months before NEET-UG, solicitor general Tushar Mehta told a bench of CJI D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra that one Pankaj Kumar, in cahoots with the Oasis School centre superintendent, entered the strongroom through the back door around 8.02am on May 5 and was inside for an hour and 21 minutes.He had a sophisticated toolkit which was kept inside the strongroom prior to his entry. After opening the trunks using the toolkit, he took pictures of the question paper booklet using a mobile phone and left the strongroom at 9.23am. Immediately, he sent it to one of his associates who took a printout and gave it to 7-8 solvers who made available solved question papers of botany and zoology at 10.15am and physics and chemistry at 10.40am.None of the solvers were allowed to take mobile phones as the gang wanted to keep dissemination of the solved questions to a target group of 155 students, whose parents had paid advance token money. They had issued post-dated cheques, which would have been encased if the question paper matched with the leaked one, CBI said.Since they wanted to monetise the leaked question paper without risking cancellation of the entire examination which would happen in case of a widespread leak, the target groups of students were gathered at pre-selected places in Patna and Hazaribag and were made to memorise the answers as much as possible in two hours.After the examination, they attempted to burn the printout of the leaked question paper and destroyed the mobile phone used for taking photos of the questions and for transmitting from Hazaribag to Patna, CBI told the court. Each question paper has a unique code printed on it and the half burnt question paper, a photo of the original, led the CBI to Hazaribag and the gang members, additional director of CBI Krishna told the SC. He said 18 mobiles from fringe elements have been seized and sent for forensic examination.On the petitioner's allegation that the question paper was available on Telegram social media platform on May 4, the solicitor general told the court that the Telegram group, which posted the question paper, was created on May 6 and the question paper was uploaded on May 6-7 night a day after the examination. The group tampered with the timestamp on the Telegram post while uploading the question paper to create a false narrative that the question paper was leaked a day before the examination, Mehta said.","CBI reached members of NEET-UG question paper leak gang by the providential recovery by Bihar Police of a partly burnt leaked question paper.

'Kamala is BRAT': How Harris campaign is embracing memes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-is-brat-how-harris-campaign-is-embracing-memes/articleshow/111967766.cms,"Driving the news

What next

US Vice President Kamala Harris has fully embraced memes and viral online trends as she launches her 2024 presidential campaign following President Joe Biden's decision not to run for re-election.The campaign is leaning into memes related to British pop star Charli XCX 's hit album "" Brat "" and Harris' own comments about falling out of a coconut tree.British pop singer Charli XCX posted “kamala IS brat” on X, referring to her sixth studio album “Brat,” and sparking a wave of meme support for Vice President Kamala Harris.Charli XCX was acknowledging something that had already taken off online, where viral memes were featuring video clips of Harris dancing and joking against Charli XCX tracks. Brat, the singer has explained, is ""that girl who is a little messy and likes to party and like maybe says some like dumb things sometimes, who like feels herself but then also like maybe has a breakdown... It’s brat, you’re brat, that’s brat.""Her tweet on Sunday sent the trend soaring, a phenomenon that could help Harris's outreach to younger voters that could play a pivotal role in the Nov. 5 election.Harris, 59, represents a significant shift for the Democratic party from President Biden, 81, whose age has been a concern in the 2024 race.The Harris campaign’s embrace of memes could engage younger voters, crucial for the upcoming election, by showcasing her relatability and modernity.This approach signifies a recognition of the changing media landscape and the importance of online communities in shaping political discourse. By embracing memes, the Harris campaign is attempting to meet voters where they are, fostering a sense of community and shared culture around her candidacy.However, the strategy is not without risks. Memes can sometimes backfire if they're perceived as inauthentic or trying too hard to be ""cool."" There's also the potential for memes to be misinterpreted or taken out of context, potentially damaging the candidate's image.Charli XCX’s ""Brat"" concept, symbolized by a specific chartreuse color, resonates with Gen Z’s disdain for the polished influencer aesthetic. Harris’ team adopted this aesthetic, signaling an understanding and acceptance of the compliment from Charli XCX. This move contrasts sharply with Trump, 78, and his traditional campaign methods.The Kamala HQ account on X now features the ""brat"" green color and the album’s font, indicating a strategic embrace of the ""brat"" persona. They posted a Venn diagram with “Biden HQ” and “Kamala HQ” circles, with the overlap labeled “holding Trump accountable,” reinforcing unity and purpose.In a survey conducted by AP-NORC in July, which took place following the debate but prior to Biden's announcement of his withdrawal from the Democratic nomination race, adults aged 18 to 29 expressed a marginally more positive opinion of Harris compared to Biden. However, a notable portion of respondents in this age group indicated that they did not have a definitive view on either candidate.Activist David Hogg shared Charli XCX’s post, emphasizing its potential impact on the youth vote. Gen Z’s familiarity with the internet and meme culture, combined with their activism, could prove essential in rallying support for Harris. Hogg noted, “The amount this single tweet may have just done for the youth vote is not insignificant.”Kamala Harris's timeline is filled with references to coconuts, an online phenomenon that started as criticism but has now been embraced by her supporters.""She would say to us, 'I don't know what's wrong with you young people. You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?'"" Harris recollected in 2023 at a White House ceremony, clad in a mauve suit. ""You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you.""Initially, critics shared the somewhat philosophical-sounding phrase numerous times, labeling Harris as ""drunk"" or ""crazy."" However, in the past 48 hours, online users and politicians have embraced the clip, sometimes genuinely and sometimes ironically, creating coconut-themed posts to support her candidacy.Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii solidified his endorsement of Harris on X by sharing a photo of himself climbing a coconut tree. Similarly, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis simply posted emojis for a coconut, tree, and the American flag on X.As Harris continues to campaign, her team’s ability to engage young voters through social media and memes will be crucial. The outcome could influence her chances in the race against former President Trump, who has already started attacking her with nicknames like ""Laffin' Kamala Harris."" Harris’ ability to connect with younger voters could be a deciding factor in the 2024 election.(With inputs from agencies)","US Vice President Kamala Harris has fully embraced memes and viral online trends as she launches her 2024 presidential campaign.

In the letter, Abbas expressed his wishes for Trump's ""strength and safety."" Trump also mentioned his eagerness to meet with Netanyahu and work towards achieving peace in the Middle East.Netanyahu had reportedly requested an in-person meeting with Trump during his visit to Washington this week. The Israeli leader is set to address US Congress on Wednesday, seeking renewed support for Israel's military operations in the Palestinian enclave. He will also meet with both Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, who recently entered the 2024 presidential race following Biden's withdrawal.Analysts believe that Netanyahu is hedging his bets on the outcome of the November US election, as polls indicate a close race. Many believe that a second Trump administration would grant Netanyahu more freedom in the Gaza war. During Trump's 2017-2021 term, the two leaders were largely aligned ideologically and on policy matters, such as moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a decision that pleased Israelis but angered Palestinians.Trump has criticized Netanyahu for the security failures surrounding the deadly Oct. 7 Hamas cross-border attack on Israel and has urged Israel to quickly secure the release of hostages taken by Hamas and end the war in Gaza. In his social media post, Trump commended Netanyahu's role in the Abraham Accords, landmark US-brokered agreements signed during his presidency that normalized relations between Israel, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates.""During my first term, we had peace and stability in the region, even signing the historic Abraham Accords - And we will have it again,"" Trump said on Truth Social. He also said that Harris, as the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination, was ""in no way capable of stopping"" world conflicts.","Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that he will host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, on Friday.

Kamala Harris bags enough delegates for President run,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-harris-bags-enough-delegates-for-president-run/articleshow/111973706.cms,"WASHINGTON: U

S vice-prez Kamala Harris has pretty much wrapped the Democratic nomination for the presidential election well before a formal process and the party convention on Aug 19, belying expectation in some quarters of internecine warfare. The party’s leadership, including Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, lawmakers, donors, activists, backroom operatives, and most of all the nearly 4000 delegates who will formally vote for the nomination quickly lined up behind Harris after a day of tumult when Prez Biden bowed out of the race on Sunday.An unofficial survey of delegates by the AP showed Harris with more than 2,500 delegates, well over the 1,976 needed to win a vote in the coming weeks.The nomination was bequeathed and blessed by the prez himself when Harris travelled to the Democratic campaign HQ in Wilmington, Delaware, Biden’s home state, on Monday to literally inherit the campaign.Secluded because of Covid at his home nearby, Biden phoned in to event to thank his staff and ask them to support Kamala with “every bit of your heart and soul.” “The name has changed at the top of the ticket, but the mission hasn’t changed at all.We still need to save this democracy. Trump is... a danger to the nation,” Biden said, repeatedly asserting that he’s “not going anywhere” and he will be campaigning for Harris soon.“I’m watching you kid, I love you,” he said, cutting in when Harris was recalling how she and husband Doug regarded the prez and his wife Jill as family. Asserting that “we made the right decisions... we have a great great candidate,” Biden urged his campaign staff to “embrace her...she’s the best”.It has been a remarkable turnaround for the US vice-prez, who only a few months ago was under pressure for what many party activists saw as a lacklustre performance, with some even suggesting she should be jettisoned from the ticket and Biden should pick a new running mate. But within 48 hours of Biden’s exit from the race, the atmosphere has been transformed, with a palpable surge of energy and vitality — not to speak of money — flowing into the campaign. Since Sunday, Harris has raised $100 million, including $81 million in the first 24 hours since announcing prez bid, a record showing as donors and contributors re-opened the money spigot after what some operatives termed as a “Dembargo” to pressu re the prez into bowing out.With Biden’s exit from the race, Trump now becomes oldest presidential candidate in US history. In her remarks, a firedup Harris (59) immediately drew a contrast with her 78-year-old opponent, accusing him of wanting to “take our country backwards to a time before many of our fellow Americans had full freedoms and rights”. “We believe in a brighter future that makes room for all Americans. Over the next 106 days, we are going to take our case to the American people, and we are going to win,” she said.Referring to her career as a courtroom prosecutor and at torney general before she became a senator and vice-prez, Harris threw out a warning to Trump. “In those roles I took on perpetrators of all kinds... Predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So, hear me when I say I know Donald Trump’s type,” she said.The dramatic turnaround on the Democratic side has enraged Trump and his MAGA flock, who flooded the social media platform X, owned by Trump supporter Elon Musk, with posts about Biden’s purported death, Harris’ coup, and araft of ugly racist rants.","U.S vice-prez Kamala Harris has pretty much wrapped the Democratic nomination for the presidential election.

Kamala Harris gets muted response in India as few see change in US ties,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-harris-gets-muted-response-in-india-as-few-see-change-in-us-ties/articleshow/111943467.cms,"Four years ago, when Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris as his running mate, much of India was abuzz over how the first Indian-American in the White House might affect the future of US-India relations .Now, Harris is a step closer to capturing the Democratic nomination for president — but few are expecting any change in ties should she win.Despite Harris’ well-documented Indian heritage and family links to the country there is little indication that her presidency would meaningfully tip the direction of the US-India relationship, which has strengthened in recent decades under both Republican and Democratic administrations.The US has sought to cultivate a deeper partnership with India as a bulwark against a more assertive China, while India has sought greater US investment and deeper cooperation in technology sharing and defense. The economic and strategic logic that underpins US-India ties would likely remain intact were Harris to win the White House, analysts and Indian officials said.“There would be a degree of continuity if she’s elected to the White House,” said Harsh Pant of the Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi think tank. “India has had a productive relationship with Mr Biden. And Kamala Harris was part of the administration.”In 2020, Biden’s choice of Harris as his running mate sparked a wave of excitement in India, with social media users poring over her family connections to Chennai, the southern Indian city where her mother was born. Undated photos surfaced of a younger Harris and her sister Maya in saris, posing with grandparents during a visit.Harris at the time was the first Black woman and the first woman of Indian descent on a major ticket in a US presidential election. Her joining the ticket sparked reports in Indian media over how a Biden-Harris win might further bolster ties between the two countries.Ties have indeed continued to improve, but India has not been a personal priority for Harris, who has instead been occupied with domestic issues, like reproductive rights and securing the US-Mexico border. Harris hosted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the White House last year, where she talked about her Indian heritage and praised Modi’s leadership. But she hasn’t visited India during her time as vice president.While on the campaign trail in 2019, Harris criticized Modi’s policies on Kashmir, a region contested by both India and Pakistan and was the site of a lengthy crackdown after Modi scrapped the Muslim-majority state’s autonomy. “We have to remind Kashmiris that they are not alone in the world,” she said in September of that year.One reason Harris’s Indian ties may not be much of a political factor is that they aren’t a prominent part in her public persona, said Sreeram Sundar Chaulia, dean of the Jindal School of International Affairs. “Unlike say Rishi Sunak in the UK, for example, who has been very open about showing his Indian and Hindu roots,” he said. Sunak was Britain’s prime minister until earlier this month.Instead, Harris’s African and Carribean heritage — her father is from Jamaica — is the more visible part of her public identity, Chaulia said.Modi, meanwhile, is widely believed to enjoy warmer and more personal ties with Donald Trump, who is the Republican’s candidate for president. Both leaders have hosted each other at political rallies in their respective countries, with Trump holding a “Howdy Modi” event in Houston before a huge crowd of Indian Americans in September 2019 — just days after Modi’s new policy in Kashmir.That event was followed up in 2020 with a visit by Trump to Modi’s home state of Gujarat for an event billed “Namaste Trump.” There, the US president addressed a rally of nearly 100,000 people at a stadium in the city of Ahmedabad.Irrespective of who wins November’s election, US-India ties should maintain their upward trajectory — despite having been tested in the last year. Allegations of India’s involvement in a murder-for-hire plot against a Sikh activist on US soil, as well as Modi’s embrace of Russian President Vladimir Putin, have both been an irritant for the US.“The relationship between the United States and India goes beyond individuals, and even beyond parties,” said Sushant Singh, a lecturer at Yale University. “All administrations, starting from President Bill Clinton, have advocated closer ties with India and that is not going to change, especially when the China factor looms large in both national capitals.”Still, in Tamil Nadu — the home state of Harris’ Indian family — pride in the prospect of an Indian-American in the White House runs high. B Krishna Moorthy, who runs the Commissionerate of Rehabilitation and Welfare of Non Resident Tamils, said the group was “deeply moved and filled with pride” at the prospect of a Harris presidency.“We look forward to seeing how her experiences and perspectives will contribute positively to global discourse, inspire future generations and foster the Indo-US relationship.”",Kamala Harris is a step closer to capturing the Democratic nomination for president. But few are expecting any change in ties should she win. The economic and strategic logic that underpins US-India ties would likely remain intact.

Trump denounced extremist label

'Stupid' Biden

Praise for autocrats

Tough stance on 'illegal' immigration

Donald Trump held a campaign rally on Sunday, his first since narrowly escaping an assassination attempt last week. He mocked Democrats and compared former Democratic house speaker Nancy Pelosi to a ""dog,"" while also attacking President Joe Biden and repeating false claims about various issues.Here are five key takeaways from his speech in rally:The recently held Republican National Convention saw Trump downplaying false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him.However, during his return to the campaign trail on Sunday night, Trump did not hold back.""The Radical Left Democrats rigged the presidential election in 2020 and we're not going to allow them to rig the presidential election in 2024,"" he declared, making another reference to voter fraud .""We want a landslide that is too big to rig,"" he added later.Trump urged early voters to ""follow your vote"" and claimed that in 2020, some states were ""shoveling ballots into wheelbarrows, moving them around.""The crowd cheered as he called on them to ""Fight, fight, fight.""Trump reiterated his disapproval of Project 2025 , a manifesto opponents describe as an authoritarian, right-wing agenda.""The other side is going around trying to make me sound extreme ... I'm not an extremist at all,"" he complained.He described the Heritage Foundation 's blueprint to reshape the federal government as the work of ""the radical right... they're seriously extreme,"" claiming, ""I don't know what the hell it is.""Trump said that the notion of him being a ""threat to democracy"" is ""misinformation.""""Last week, I took a bullet for democracy,"" he said.Trump criticized Biden's candidacy, highlighting concerns within the Democratic Party about Biden's age, as some believe that at 81, he is too old to serve another term.""They have no idea who their candidate is ... Sort of interesting, this guy goes and he gets the votes and now they want to take it away. That's democracy,"" Trump said in Michigan.He claimed that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had turned on Biden ""like a dog.""Trump called Biden ""stupid"" and ""a low-IQ individual,"" and also criticized Vice President Kamala Harris—who could succeed Biden if he steps aside—as ""crazy.""Trump highlighted his relationships with global autocrats, claiming that his rapport with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un made the United States safer.""All he wants to do is buy nuclear weapons and make them,"" he said of Kim. ""I said, just relax, chill. You've got enough. You got, you got so much nuclear weapons, so much, I said, just relax... let's go to a baseball game.""Trump praised Hungarian President Viktor Orban as a ""very powerful leader"" and asserted that, had he (Trump) been the US leader, Russian President Vladimir Putin would never have invaded Ukraine in 2022.He mentioned receiving a ""beautiful note"" from Chinese President Xi Jinping after the assassination attempt, calling Xi a ""great guy.""Trump told reporters that Xi is ""a brilliant man. He controls 1.4 billion people with an iron fist.""Trump issued numerous threats against illegal migrants, describing an ""invasion"" at the US border and suggesting that Democrats were allowing it to secure votes.Trump said that if he returns to office, he'll launch the ""largest deportation operation in the history of our country.""""When I return to the White House, we will stop the plunder, rape, slaughter, and destruction of our American suburb cities,"" he declared.""We're going to get the bad ones out. We're going to get them out immediately. It's not going to take long.""He vowed to ""crush migrant crime"" and accused countries like Venezuela of ""dumping their criminals into the United States of America,"" asserting that ""we're not going to take it anymore.""(With agency inputs)","Donald Trump held a campaign rally on Sunday, his first since narrowly escaping an assassination attempt last week.

Obama had a part because he said he wasn’t going to support him,” Trump was quoted as telling.“Nancy Pelosi dumped him. They all dumped him, and they said, 'Either you get out nice or we’re going to go after you.’ And that’s what happened. And he had no choice. There’s no question about it,” the GOP nominee added.“They told him to get out, ‘You’re not going to win,” Trump said.“The debate was really Biden’s ending. He was not good at the debate. And I think I was good. Some people say I was very good, but whether I was or not, he was not good. And I think that was the end of Biden, frankly"".If Biden was disrespectfully forced to step down by his party still may be a rumor, but what is certain is Biden was under growing pressure since the lackluster debate with GOP nominee and former President Trump. And since then the president had to contend with a democratic party, donors, and critics urging him to step down, some publicly and some privately.Even democratic bigwigs like Barrack Obama and former house speaker Nancy Pelosi are reported to have conveyed their their disbelief about the 81 year old's chances to defeat Trump in private conversation, while other senior democratic lawmakers and big time donors like Hollywood star George Clooney publicly urged Biden to step aside and make way a new democratic candidate. However, with 106 days to go for the November elections and in isolation due to Covid 19, Joe Biden finally took the call to step down from the race and endorse his vice president Kamala Harris.Since taking the call to drop out, the president was briefly missing from public eye fueling speculations about a ""terminal illness,"" ""imminent death"" and a ""White House coup"" with #WhereisJoe"" trending virally.

Harris's new position as the US Presidential candidate , buoyed by a wave of endorsements, donations, and pledged delegates, reflects a significant shift in the race.However, the results are close, with both polls falling within their respective margins of error.

When factoring in third-party candidates or independents, Trump and Harris are tied at 42 per cent.This development follows the Republican National Convention where Trump accepted the party’s nomination and Biden’s unexpected withdrawal. Despite the bounce typically received by nominees following such conventions, Harris's performance suggests she has effectively countered this effect.Additionally, 87 per cent of Americans believe Biden’s decision to withdraw was the right move, according to the PBS News survey. The decision appears to resonate across party lines, with 41 per cent of respondents feeling it enhances Democrats' chances in November, while 24 per cent believe it decreases the party’s odds, and 34 per cent see no impact.Trump’s polling advantage remains slim, with RealClearPolitics showing a 1.6 percentage point lead over Harris on average.

#WhereisJoe trends: Trump’s MAGA fanatics spread ‘death’ & ‘White House coup’ rumours,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/whereisjoe-trends-trumps-maga-fanatics-spread-death-white-house-coup-rumours/articleshow/111973557.cms,":

WASHINGTONVicious rumours about Prez Biden’s “terminal illness” “imminent death” and a “White House coup” and racist dogwhistles surrounding Kamala Harris’ life and career flowed through the sewers of social media on Tuesday as MAGA maniacs went into full meltdown mode following an unexpectedly smooth transition in the Democratic Party.With hashtags such as #whereisjoe and #dumbasarock, Trump supporters rained abuse on his opponents, going so far as as to claim Democratic backroom operatives had orchestrated a “palace coup” by blackmailing Biden into bowing out of the prez race.Laura Loomer, one such supporter patronised and praised by Trump, claimed Biden is “terminally ill and unable to perform his duties” and “final preparations are being made for him, and “soon we will have President @KamalaHarris as the 47th President”. Conspiracy theorists also scrutinised Biden’s Sunday letter announcing the end of his candidacy. Several fixated on Biden’s autograph, which clearly bears the name “J.R. Biden” but also con tains an underline not seen in other signatures from the prez. Commentators also noted the lack of a White House seal or letterhead, even though it wasn’t a govt communication.Such insights were apparently based on Biden not being seen in public for five days (he had been at his beach home recovering from Covid). But in a statement, Biden said he would address the nation from the Oval Office at 8 pm Wednesday, “on what lies ahead, and how I will finish the job for the American people”.Previously, MA GA fanatics have prematurely killed off ex-prez Jimmy Carter, who is 99 and in hospice care. A fake letter announcing his death made its way swiftly through MAGA circles on social media before it was debunked.Toxic MAGA trolls also continued to attack Harris with fake narratives on X, including posting digitally altered photos showing sex predator Jeffery Epstein’s face super-imposed on the face of her husband Douglas Emhoff. Some of the rage is tacitly encouraged by Trump himself with his vitriolic and sexist attacks on Harris.Trump’s running mate JD Vance has also taken the cue: “If Biden can’t run for prez, he can’t serve as prez.” In the MAGA narrative, Democratic operatives will invoke Article 25 to replace Biden with Harris in a “soft coup” to make her the 47th prez even before the elections. The meltdown is quite inexplicable considering most polls show Trump leading. Evidently, the prospect of Trump being challenged by a liberal woman, and a brown one at that, has brought out the worst in them."," MAGA maniacs went into full meltdown mode following an unexpectedly smooth transition in the Democratic Party. Trump supporters rained abuse on his opponents, going so far as to claim Democratic backroom operatives had orchestrated a “palace coup” by blackmailing Biden into bowing out.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111973550,imgsize-1257225,width-400,resizemode-4/111973550.jpg"
"'Blast of rock, water and steam': Hydrothermal explosion rocks Yellowstone National Park, sends dozens running for safety",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/yellowstone-national-park-hydrothermal-explosion-sends-dozens-running-for-safety/articleshow/111973361.cms,"Yellowstone National Park experienced a dramatic hydrothermal explosion on Tuesday morning, startling visitors and causing a significant safety incident. The eruption occurred around 10 am in Biscuit Basin , a popular area known for its hot springs, located just a few miles north of the iconic Old Faithful Geyser.Witnesses captured the event on video, showing a violent eruption that propelled steam, water, and dark-colored debris high into the sky.The eruption caused chaos among the onlookers, many of whom were seen scrambling to safety, shouting warnings such as ""Back up!"" and ""Holy cow!"" as they fled the scene. The area was quickly enveloped in a thick cloud of steam and debris.Despite the dramatic visuals, no injuries were reported. However, the explosion resulted in significant damage to the boardwalk in Biscuit Basin, a wooden walkway designed to protect visitors from Yellowstone's volatile geothermal features . Photos from the aftermath showed damaged guardrails and boards covered in silt and rocks, with debris scattered near muddy pools.The cause of the explosion is believed to be a blockage in the natural geothermal plumbing beneath Yellowstone's thermal features. Mike Poland, a scientist with the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory, explained that the explosion likely resulted from a buildup of heat and pressure, similar to a pressure cooker, which eventually caused the water to flash into steam and trigger the eruption. Poland estimated that the explosion sent material about 100 feet (30 meters) into the air, reported AP.Poland characterized the explosion as ""on the big side"" compared to typical hydrothermal eruptions, which often occur without causing harm due to their remote locations. The largest known hydrothermal explosion crater, located in Yellowstone, measures 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometers) across and was formed approximately 13,800 years ago.The site of Tuesday's explosion was Black Diamond Pool, a 120-foot-long (37-meter) hot pool known for its wide thermal features. An aerial photo taken after the eruption showed the pool slightly enlarged and its water turned a muddy beige, in contrast to the deep blue hue of the nearby Sapphire Pool, which remained unchanged.Park geologists are currently investigating the specifics of the explosion. Previous similar events have occurred in Biscuit Basin in 2009, 1991, and following the magnitude 7.2 Hebgen Lake earthquake in 1959.The eruption did not signify any new volcanic activity , as Yellowstone's volcanic system remains at normal levels, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Nonetheless, the incident serves as a stark reminder of the inherent dangers associated with Yellowstone's geothermal features, which have historically led to at least 22 fatalities due to thermal-related injuries since 1890.Visitors are continually advised to adhere to safety guidelines, including staying on designated boardwalks and trails, to avoid the thin, brittle crust covering the scalding and sometimes acidic waters of the park's thermal features.","The eruption occurred around 10 am in Biscuit Basin, a popular area known for its hot springs.

Kennedy Jr., Harris led Trump 42% to 38%, an advantage outside the margin of error. Kennedy, favored by 8% of voters in the poll, has yet to qualify for the ballot in many states ahead of the Nov. 5 election.The poll, which was conducted online, surveyed 1,241 U.S. adults nationwide, including 1,018 registered voters.","US Vice President Kamala Harris leads Republican Donald Trump 44% to 42% in a new Reuters/Ipsos poll.

The ADL also wants training for faculty, staff and students and the removal of antisemitic posters, flags and other material on school property.A school district spokesperson declined to comment on an active investigation.Colleges, universities and high schools nationwide have seen a wave of pro-Palestinian student protests in response to Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza. The war began when Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, taking hostages and killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians. The toll in Gaza recently surpassed 39,000 Palestinians killed, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.Most of the focus has been on protests that rocked college campuses this spring, leading to thousands of arrests. But a recent congressional hearing spotlighted antisemitism in K-12 education, with the leaders of New York City Public Schools, the Montgomery County Public Schools in Maryland, and the Berkeley Unified School District in California all vigorously denying they had failed to address hostility toward Jewish people.Like Philadelphia, New York City and Montgomery County are facing Education Department civil rights investigations into allegations of antisemitism. The ADL filed a complaint against Berkeley in California state court.In Philadelphia, schools leaders allowed hostility toward Jewish students to spread and intensify over the past nine months, and “failed to address a rampant culture of retaliation and fear"" that prevented Jewish students and parents from even coming forward, James Pasch, ADL’s senior director of national litigation, said in an interview Tuesday.“There's an environment here that really needs to change, and it really needs to change now,” he said.In May, a group called the School District of Philadelphia Jewish Family Association made similar allegations in a complaint to the education department under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination based on shared ancestry.After that complaint was filed, a group of pro-Palestinian teachers called Philly Educators for Palestine said that while any incidents of discrimination should be addressed, it's not antisemitic to criticize Israel or advocate for Palestinians. The group said the complaint was an attempt to silence teachers and students and a distraction from “the carnage being inflicted upon Palestinians in Gaza by Israel.”A message was sent to Philly Educators for Palestine seeking comment on the latest allegations via an allied group, the Racial Justice Organizing Committee.","The district has ignored persistent harassment and bullying of Jewish students, lawyers say.

This camp will continue till the release of the PTI founder,"" he said.Khan has been imprisoned at the high-security Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi for almost a year upon his conviction in three cases - the Toshakhana corruption case, the cipher case, and the un-Islamic marriage case -- in which his wife, Bushra Bibi, is also jailed.Though Khan had secured bail or his conviction was set aside, he has not been released.Khan was arrested on August 5 last year after his conviction in the first Toshakhana corruption case filed by the Election Commission of Pakistan. Since then, he has been kept in jail in various cases.Gohar also said that the party's reservations regarding ""illegal and unconstitutional actions"" had been conveyed to National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq and the party decided to raise voice for the PTI lawmakers and their families who were being picked up.He also strongly condemned the sealing of the party's secretariat in the federal capital.Former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser said that the major demand was to set Khan and his wife free.""Our first demand is to release the PTI founder, his wife Bushra Bibi and other detainees, including Raoof Hasan and party workers,"" he said.He also demanded the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) led coalition government to immediately resign over ""bad governance and mismanaging the economy"".The strike came as authorities were gradually increasing pressure on the PTI, which continued to target the establishment and the government. Despite dozens of cases against Khan, he has refused to soften his tone and instead routinely criticise the Army leadership.PTI leaders have also kept up the pressure on the government by calling it illegal which allegedly came to power through fraudulent elections.","Pakistani authorities sealed the central office of Imran Khan's party here over violation of safety standards.

She claimed that Khan's residence in Lahore, Zaman Park, had become a ""training hub for terrorists "", where petrol bombs were made and attacks on the state were planned.The May 9 riots erupted across Pakistan after Khan was arrested by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) in a corruption case. Hundreds of PTI workers and senior leaders were arrested for their involvement in the violence and attacks on military installations, including the Jinnah House, ISI building in Faisalabad, and General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi.Maryam also accused the PTI of conspiring to default the country, writing letters to the International Monetary Fund, waving cipher messages, and disrespecting memorials as part of a larger plot. She called for strict action against the PTI under the Constitution and law, citing national security and interests.The chief minister further criticized the PTI for alienating friendly countries, making baseless accusations against the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), and disrupting Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit in 2014 by staging a sit-in. She recounted PTI's previous attacks on Parliament, PTV, and the Prime Minister's house, and accused them of violence against police officers and desecrating the Supreme Court's walls.In March, Minister for Information and Broadcasting Ataullah Tarar said that a handful of ""miscreants"" associated with the PTI were bent upon sabotaging Pakistan's deal with the IMF, which he said was crucial for economic stability.He said that at the protest, activists belonging to PTI were urging the IMF to give funds to Pakistan only if their jailed leader was released, regretting that activists of an ""anti-national"" party continued to hold sit-ins and protests outside the IMF offices.

The army said the party information secretary was in charge of PTI ’s digital media cell which, it alleged, was involved in running anti-state propaganda.Last month PM Shehbaz Sharif had approved a military offensive to counter aspikein terrorist attacks across Pakistan, particularly in volatile northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and southwestern Balochistan provinces, but the idea was widely criticised by opposition parties, particularly PTI and the rights group Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM). They termed it a ploy against Pashtuns to earn dollars from major powers and exploit their resources.Addressing a presser in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, the military’s spokesperson, Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, asked, “Why did a mafia, a political mafia , and an illegal mafia say that they would not let this campaign (OperationAzm-e-Istehkam, or Resolve for Stability) happen?” He added that opponents of the offensive had tried to make it “controversial” and paint it as a purely military operation in which thousands of people would be displaced.He did not name any party or group butcalled the army’s critics “politicalandillegal mafias”,an apparent reference to PTI and PTM.Lt Gen Chaudhry said they were using “fake news and propaganda” to spread lies about the army and its intentions.“This is digital terrorism,” he said. “The physical terrorist also attacks law enforcement agencies and the army, and the digital terrorist also attacks the army. They are doing the same thing.”“Digital terrorists”, the spokesman said, would be deterred through laws, regulation and monitoring.He, however, questioned the lack of action against such individuals despite their activities against the leadership of the state and other institutions. “Instead of the courts and regulations moving forward against them, they’re given further space and they’re made heroes in the name of freedom of expression,” he said.Ahead of Sharif’s press conference, security forces had raided PTI’s offices and arrested Raoof Hasan from the party’s central secretariat. The raid came a week after the govt had said it planned to ban the party.“The PTI digital media centre had become a centre of international disinformation, from where anti-Pakistan propaganda is run throughout the world,” Islamabad police said, adding that those directly involved in anti-national propaganda were arrested and all evidence from PTI’s digital media cell wasconfiscated.The party issued a statement on X, saying: “It’s absolutely shameful how Islamabad police continues to completely mock and disregard every law in this country. Law of the jungle is reigning over Pakistan!”The crackdown on PTI follows several court rulings in its favour this month that threaten PM Sharif’s govt, which came to power in Feb this year with the military’s backing.","Pakistan army accuses its criticsof “politicising” its anti-terrorism efforts.

The Pakistan army on Monday accused an "" illegal political mafia "" of trying to sabotage its renewed military operation, codenamed "" Azm-i-Istehkam "" (Resolve for Stability), against rising terrorism in the country.Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) director general Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif, in a press conference in Rawalpindi, stated that a ""massive, illegal political mafia"" has risen to undermine the operation due to ""vested interests"".Sharif clarified that Azm-i-Istehkam is not just a military operation but a comprehensive counter-terrorism campaign launched through national consensus to reinvigorate the already in-place National Action Plan (NAP).He stressed that the purpose of the operation is to eliminate terrorism, which will eventually lead to ""societal and national uplift"".However, the DG ISPR accused a ""very strong lobby"" of having a vested interest in sabotaging the operation, as it does not want the NAP to succeed.He alleged that this entity is receiving a lot of money to subvert the operation.""The stakes in [sabotaging] this operation are very high, and it's not based on any ideology but involves a lot of money,"" he said.Lt Gen Sharif stated that the ""illegal political mafia"" made the first move to make the operations controversial through false and fake arguments.He pointed out that the problem lies in the implementation of the NAP's other points, such as the regularisation and registration of religious seminaries, where only a bit over 16,000 out of about 32,000 seminaries have been registered so far. He questioned whether the army should be responsible for these tasks.The DG ISPR also mentioned the issue of the ""illegal spectrum"", which hides a major illegal economy through which the criminal system and terrorism operate. He said the requirement of the illegal spectrum is a ""soft state"" and the solution to it is the National Action Plan.While the DG ISPR's statements highlight the challenges faced by the government in implementing its counter-terrorism strategy, it is essential to note that the army's involvement in political matters can be a sensitive issue.The military has historically played a significant role in the country's politics, and its direct intervention in political affairs has often been a subject of controversy.It remains to be seen whether the army will take a more active role in the country's affairs in response to the alleged sabotage of the counter-terrorism campaign by the ""illegal political mafia"".","Pakistan army accuses an ""illegal political mafia "" of trying to sabotage its renewed military operation.
