""To Build Peace That Lasts"": China Claims Credit for India-Pakistan Conflict, Follows Trump

NEW DELHI: India has rejected China's claim of mediation in its conflict with Pakistan, reiterating its stand that the military action was paused following a request from the Pakistani DGMO to his Indian counterpart.Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi claimed on Tuesday that the crisis involving India and Pakistan were among the ""hotspot issues"" mediated by his country in 2025. The assertion, similar to the US President Donald Trump's boasts of having played the peace broker in May, came as a surprise because of the time lag and the assessment here that Beijing was the undeclared participant in the4-day conflict arrayed on Pakistan's side.Indian govt sources expressed surprise at Wang's statement, whose country, in fact, provided crucial military assistance to Pakistan in May 7-10 conflict, and said it was as baseless as the repeated assertion of President Trump that he brokered a ""ceasefire"".They emphasised that China was not part of any conversation related to the cessation of military action. India, from PM Modi downwards, has repeatedly asserted that it agreed to pause the military action after Pakistani DGMO Maj Gen Kashif Abdullah reached out to his Indian counterpart Lt Gen Rajiv Ghai.India has consistently maintained there is no place for any third-party intervention in matters related to India and Pakistan, terming them bilateral.Wang had said, ""China mediated in northern Myanmar, Iranian nuclear issue, tensions between Pakistan and India, issues between Palestine and Israel, and the recent conflict between Cambodia and Thailand.""India had targeted terror infrastructure in Pakistan and PoK - following the killing of civilians, mostly tourists, by terrorists in Pahalgam - as part of Opeartion Sindoor, and had then responded to the hostile neighbour's military action.","China's foreign minister Wang Yi claimed on Tuesday that the crisis involving India and Pakistan were among the ""hotspot issues"" mediated by his country in 2025.

PANAJI: Holding him guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, a sessions court in North Goa handed Sandeep Verlekar, 55, a sentence of 6 years and 6 months in prison for assaulting his aged, bed-ridden mother under the influence of alcohol in Merces in 2019.Sandeep was arrested for dragging his 69-year-old mother, Laxmibai, from the bed, hitting her with his fists and leaving her out in the verandah, where she succumbed to her injuries.The court took a lenient view. It considered that Verlekar was an alcoholic and stated that he had no intention to kill his mother. The court directed that the imprisonment of 6 years, 1 month and 11 days already undergone by him be set off, and that he be released upon completion of the balance period.Public prosecutor Roy D'Souza told the court that he should be given the maximum sentence as he had committed a serious offence by assaulting his own bedridden mother. Rohan Desai, appearing under free legal aid, stated that he had been in custody for over 6 years since he was arrested in Nov 2019, and that he had two children.The court observed that the manner in which he had assaulted his mother showed that he had been under the influence of liquor and had no intention of killing her.""I also came to the conclusion that the act of assault committed by the accused was not committed with an intention to kill his own mother. Although it is a death caused, he never intended to kill his own mother. Therefore, according to me, a lenient view has to be taken against the accused,"" Merces sessions judge Irshad Agha said.The sessions court observed that there was no complaint of misbehaviour on his part during the period in custody. ""The period of sentence already undergone acted as rehabilitation for the accused as he could not access liquor. In this context, I do not find any reason that the accused will again turn alcoholic to commit any such act,"" the court stated.","Sandeep Verlekar was arrested for dragging his 69-year-old mother, Laxmibai, from the bed, hitting her with his fists and leaving her out in the verandah, where she succumbed to her injuries.

BHOPAL/JABALPUR: The Madhya Pradesh high court has refused to interfere with the judgment of a Pocso court in Narmadapuram district awarding 20 years of rigorous imprisonment to a person accused of having sexual relationship with a 17-year-old, whom he married later. The couple now has a child.A division bench of Justices Vivek Agarwal and R K Choubey said the consent of a minor to a sexual relationship was immaterial, and a decision to suspend the sentence of a person convicted for rape under the Pocso Act could be taken only by Supreme Court exercising its power under Article 142 of the Constitution.Earlier, counsel for the appellant contended that coordinate benches granted relief of suspension of sentence even in the case of a 14-year-old girl, whereas in the present case, the age of the survivor was 17 and she was a consenting partner.The bench, however, stated that it was a ""prerogative of the Supreme Court to take a call by exercising its authority under Article 142"".According to the prosecution's case, on June 1, 2023, the rape survivor lodged a police complaint in Itarsi stating that she used to visit her grandmother and became acquainted with the appellant on one such visit. On Feb 14, 2023, he invited her to lunch at his house. There, he raped her and threatened to kill her if she disclosed it to anyone, she alleged, adding he blackmailed and raped her on three more occasions.The accused married the survivor when he came out on bail during the trial.The appellant's counsel pleaded for leniency saying a son was born out of wedlock, and the survivor would be left to take care of him alone. The court, however, said since it was established that the survivor was a minor at the time, the accused could not be absolved of the charge.","Madhya Pradesh high court refused to interfere with Pocso court's judgment.

Khaleda Zia’s funeral: EAM Jaishankar Hands Over Modi’s Letter To BNP Chief Tarique Rahman In Dhaka

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid tribute to former Bangladesh prime minister Khaleda Zia in a personal letter addressed to her son and Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) acting chairman Tarique Rahman, describing her as a leader of “rare resolve and conviction” whose legacy would continue to shape ties between India and Bangladesh.The letter was handed over by external affairs minister S Jaishankar, who represented India at Khaleda Zia’s funeral in Dhaka on Wednesday. Zia, a three-time prime minister and the founding figure of the BNP, died on Tuesday after a prolonged illness, prompting an outpouring of condolences from regional leaders.In his message, PM Modi wrote, “Dear Tarique Rahman Saheb, I was deeply saddened to learn of the passing away of your mother, Her Excellency Begum Khaleda Zia, former Prime Minister of Bangladesh and Chairperson of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Please accept my heartfelt condolences on this profound personal loss.” He recalled his meeting with Zia during his visit to Dhaka in June 2015, saying she “made many important contributions to the development of Bangladesh, as well as to the strengthening of India-Bangladesh relations”.PM Modi described Zia as “the first woman Prime Minister of Bangladesh” and said that while her death left “an irreplaceable void”, her “vision and legacy will endure”.Expressing confidence in Tarique Rahman’s political role, he added, “I am confident that her ideals will be carried forward under your able leadership of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, and will continue to serve as a guiding light to ensure a new beginning and the enrichment of the deep and historic partnership between India and Bangladesh. ”The prime minister also extended his thoughts to the Bangladeshi people, praising their “shared values, democratic traditions, and a deep sense of national unity”, and wished Rahman strength and fortitude in overcoming the loss.Jaishankar echoed similar sentiments during his interaction with Rahman, later posting on social media that he had conveyed “deepest condolences on behalf of the Government and people of India” and expressed confidence that “Begum Khaleda Zia’s vision and values will guide the development of our partnership”.On the sidelines of the funeral, Jaishankar exchanged greetings with several regional dignitaries, including Pakistan National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq and Nepal’s foreign minister Balananda Sharma.","PM Modi paid tribute to former Bangladesh prime minister Khaleda Zia in a personal letter addressed to her son and Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) acting chairman Tarique Rahman.

Security Forces Launch Cordon-And-Search Operations In Kishtwar, Doda and Poonch

JAMMU: A village defence guard (VDG) opened fire after allegedly spotting a terror suspect in a remote village in J&K’s Rajouri district, even as security forces intensified surveillance in the upper reaches of Chenab region — Doda and Kishtwar districts — officials said Wednesday.Officials said the VDG fired about six rounds in the air upon allegedly sighting a terror suspect in Dali village in Rajouri’s Kalakote area late Tuesday. None was injured in the firing. “A joint team of the Army and police subsequently rushed to the spot and launched a search operation in the area, but found nothing suspicious,” an official said.A series of anti-terror operations was underway in the upper reaches of Doda, Kishtwar and Ramban districts in Chenab region, especially in areas bordering Udhampur and Kathua districts, officials said. Similar operations were also ongoing in the two frontier districts of Rajouri and Poonch, as well as Reasi, which shares a border with Rajouri-Ramban in Jammu Division and Kulgam in south Kashmir, said officials.Security forces were anticipating that terrorists hiding in non-habituated (higher reaches) may try to enter the mainland, in view of the closure of mountain passes, to get commodities. The intensified operations by Army’s Rashtriya Rifles and J&K Police’s SOG were also extended to a large area in Chenab region, said officials.The Army, meanwhile, stepped up efforts to strengthen grassroots security by imparting training to VDGs — the “first responders” in the security grid — in Doda district. On Tuesday, about 150 VDGs from 17 remote villages along Doda-Chamba border, including women volunteers, underwent intensive training in handling automatic rifles, minor tactics, self-defence, bunker construction and repelling enemy attacks, officials said. The training was being conducted at Shingini Panchayat in Bhalessa, around 90km from Doda district HQ, to equip volunteers with the necessary skills to protect their villages and act as the first line of defence, especially in vulnerable areas, an official said.Separately, a suspected Pakistani drone was spotted hovering briefly over Phulpur area near the International Border in Samba district late Tuesday. “Soon after the sighting, police and BSF personnel rushed to the spot and conducted a thorough search to ascertain whether any payload containing weapons or narcotics had been air-dropped, but found nothing on the ground,” an official said.","Village defence guard opened fire after allegedly spotting a terror suspect in a remote village in J&K’s Rajouri district.

'Op Sindoor drawn a new line against terrorism'

Operation Keller

Operation Mahadev

Amit Shah in Monsoon Session

NEW DELHI: The ""new normal"" in India's national security playbook took on a harder edge in 2025. Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi , the country's zero-tolerance doctrine against terrorism, especially the kind nurtured across the border in Pakistan, became not just policy but a mindset. For years, Pakistan has acted much like a hostile neighbour, failing short of India's expectations while cultivating, training and unleashing anti-India sentiment and activities from its soil. In 2025, that long-running tension erupted into one of the darkest chapters in Kashmir's recent history.Crossborder terrorism and India's counterterror responses became defining markers of 2025. The Pahalgam massacre, one of the most horrifying attacks in recent years, shook the nation and ignited widespread grief and anger.The Prime Minister, who was abroad at the time, cut short his trip and returned to New Delhi immediately.In his first public remarks after the attack, switching briefly and unusually to English, he signalled India's mood and mission. ""Today, from the soil of Bihar, I say this to the whole world, India will identify, trace and punish every terrorist and their backers. We will pursue them to the ends of the Earth,"" he declared, framing a battle of ""Yuddha"" against terror from the land of ""Buddha.""The year went on to witness not just an ugly terror attack but also India's most far-reaching counteroffensive since the 2016 surgical strikes and the 2019 Balakot airstrikes. Operation Sindoor , New Delhi's military retaliation after Pahalgam, targeted terror infrastructure deep inside Pakistan and PoK, making this the first time India expanded its precision strikes beyond PoK into mainland Pakistan.The operation, the government says, remains in a ""paused"" state. Alongside Sindoor, several other counterterror operations were carried out through the year, keeping a firm and continuous check on terror.April 22 began as a quiet spring morning in the Baisaran Valley in Pahalgam, a routine day for a popular tourist spot. Within hours, it became the scene of one of the gravest terror incidents in recent years. Pakistan-sponsored terrorists, from a proxy group of Lashkar-e-Taiba, opened fire on civilians in the meadows, killing 26 people and leaving the region shaken.Eyewitnesses recounted the attackers tried to identify victims' faith by demanding Aadhaar cards or driving licences, asking them to recite the kalma, and even forcing some to unzip their pants so they could check for circumcision. Unlike many other terror incidents, this attack reportedly did not follow a usual pattern, as the killings appeared to be carried out selectively.As soon as the news reached the national capital, New Delhi moved quickly. Union home minister Amit Shah reached the Valley the same day and also visited the site in Baisaran later. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was on an official trip to Saudi Arabia, cut short his two-day visit, skipped a scheduled state dinner to be hosted by Kingdom and returned to India immediately.Global leaders spoke to the Prime Minister, expressing condemnation and solidarity. The attack also coincided with the visit of US Vice President JD Vance, who was in India on a four-day trip with his family. From US President Donald Trump to then Nepalese prime minister KP Oli, several world leaders reached out to PM Modi, conveying support for India and strongly condemning the attack.""President Donald Trump @realDonaldTrump @POTUS called PM @narendramodi and conveyed his deepest condolences at the loss of innocent lives in the terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir . President Trump strongly condemned the terror attack and expressed full support to India to bring to justice the perpetrators of this heinous attack. India and the United States stand together in the fight against terror,"" The ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in a post on X.As investigations began, it quickly became evident that the conspiracy once again traced back to Pakistan and its proxy terror networks. Evidence pointed clearly to crossborder involvement, with the planning and execution of the Pahalgam attack fitting the same pattern seen in past incidents in the region.For the agencies, Pakistan’s role was no mystery. Army units and intelligence teams followed the trail, identified those behind the killings, and eventually eliminated the Lashkar terrorists responsible for the April 22 massacre during Operation Mahadev in August.The very next day of attack, on April 23 -- India initiated retaliatory measures diplomatically against Pakistan. New Delhi announced a series of strict punitive actions, signalling a decisive diplomatic response.That evening, the ministry of external affairs, led by foreign secretary Vikram Misri, briefed the media after a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) chaired by Prime Minister Modi. The intent was communicated unambiguously: India would respond firmly to the Pahalgam attack and hold Pakistan accountable.The decisions taken were strong retaliatory steps aimed at exerting diplomatic and economic pressure on Pakistan, whose soil has long been used to support terror networks targeting India.The long-standing Indus Waters Treaty, signed in 1960 with World Bank mediation, was put in abeyance with immediate effect. The move sent a clear message. The waters of the Indus, Jhelum and Chenab are vital for Pakistan’s agriculture, particularly wheat and cotton, and form the backbone of its water security.Following the suspension, Pakistan faced a heightened risk of inadequate water storage earlier this year, according to the Ecological Threat Report 2025. Roughly 80% of Pakistani farmland depends on the Indus basin, as do most of its hydropower projects.India closed the Attari border ICP and instructed individuals who had crossed with valid endorsements to return through the same route immediately.Pakistani nationals were barred from travelling to India under the SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme. All previously issued SVES visas were cancelled with immediate effect, and Pakistani nationals in India were instructed to leave within 48 hours.India declared the defence, naval and air advisors at the Pakistani high commission in New Delhi as Persona Non Grata, giving them a week to leave the country.India simultaneously withdrew its own defence, naval and air Advisors from its high commission in Islamabad. These posts in both missions were formally annulled, along with the withdrawal of five associated support staff on each side.The staff strength in both high commissions was ordered to be reduced from 55 to 30, with the changes taking effect by 1 May 2025.These measures underscored a clear shift: Pakistan was pushed to the margins of India's diplomatic priorities, a direct consequence of the Pahalgam attack and its continuing role in crossborder terrorism.After days of rising tension and diplomatic fallout with Pakistan, India launched a decisive military response. On the intervening night of May 6 and 7, almost two weeks after the Pahalgam attack, the Indian armed forces carried out Operation Sindoor, targeting key terror bases, including high-value targets.The terrorists responsible for the Pahalgam attack were linked to LeT's proxy, The Resistance Front (TRF). The operation struck nine terror installations, including the Muridke base of LeT chief Hafiz Saeed. The Bahawalpur base of JeM chief Masood Azhar was also targeted, resulting in the deaths of several of Azhar’s family members.According to the ministry of defence, the operation was so far ""focused, measured and non-escalatory,"" deliberately avoiding Pakistani military facilities.The Indian Air Force struck nine high-value terror camps where militants harboured and trained. These included:India made it clear that the precision strikes targeted only terrorist infrastructure and did not affect Pakistan's state or army installations.But in the following night, Pakistan carried out another misadventure and attempted retaliation with the barrage of drones and missiles, which were seen from several cities on border line.However, India's Sudarshan Chakra, a multi-layered integrated air defence system including IADS and the S-400, intercepted and neutralised all threats, including Turkish drones, Chinese missiles, and possibly some Pakistani aircraft, preventing any damage on Indian soil.The day after the operation, the MEA held a briefing led by foreign secretary Misri, joined by Colonel Sofia Qureshi and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh, to provide updates on the military action of the night.""These were neutralized by the Integrated Counter Unmanned Aerial System and other Air Defence systems,"" said Wing Commander Vyomika Singh during an MEA briefing.In response, India carried out further strikes inside Pakistan, targeting 11 key airbases, including Nur Khan, Rahim Yar Khan, Bholari, Rafiqui, Murid, Sukkur, Sialkot, Pasrur, Chunian, Skaru, and Jacobabad. The strikes reportedly destroyed around 20 percent of Pakistan Air Force infrastructure, including fighter jets and a SAM system. Over 50 personnel were killed at Bholari Air Base, including Pakistan squadron leader Usman Yousuf.Some bases, such as Rahim Yar Khan, remained non-operational for months.Military tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours eventually eased on May 10 after Pakistan's DGMO contacted the Indian counterpart to agree on a ceasefire on land, air, and water.However, India maintains that Operation Sindoor is just ""paused"" as the Prime Minister Modi, and Amit Shah clearly stated.In his first address after the strikes, he said, ""India has only paused military action and will retaliate on its own terms if another terror attack occurs."" He added, ""The three armies of India -- Air Force, Navy, and Army, along with BSF and military forces -- are on alert. After the surgical strike and air strike, Operation Sindoor is India’s policy against terrorism. Operation Sindoor has drawn a new line against terrorism. """"Operation Sindoor is not just a name but it's a reflection of the feelings of millions of people of the country,"" Prime Minister Modi said.Months later, IAF chief Amar Preet Singh confirmed the scale of losses inflicted on Pakistan. ""We have signs of one C-130 class aircraft and at least four to five fighter jets, most likely F-16s, along with one SAM system destroyed. We have clear evidence of a long-range strike exceeding 300 km, along with five high-tech fighters between F-16 and JF-17 class,"" he said.Soon after Operation Sindoor, the Army launched large-scale raids and counterterror operations across the Valley. One of the major actions was Operation Keller, a ""search and destroy"" mission initiated in May in the Keller forest area of Jammu and Kashmir's Shopian district.The Army, CRPF and Jammu and Kashmir Police conducted a coordinated manhunt to track terrorists believed to be hiding in the dense forest belt.During the operation, security forces eliminated three Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists and recovered a significant cache of arms and ammunition, including AK-47 rifles, grenades and hundreds of rounds.Those killed included Shahid Kuttay, an LeT/TRF commander, and Hussain Thokar, both linked to recent terror activities in the region.Operation Keller underscored the heightened synergy between security forces and intelligence agencies after the Pahalgam massacre, marking the start of a sustained crackdown on terrorist networks in the Valley.The terrorists responsible for the April 22 Pahalgam massacre, in which 26 civilians were killed, remained on the run for months. Under Operation Mahadev, they were finally tracked down and neutralised.The operation, carried out over 12 days with precise intelligence inputs, led to the elimination of three Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists confirmed to be involved in the Pahalgam killings.Union home minister Amit Shah announced the outcome during the Monsoon Session of Parliament: “I want to tell the House and the people of the country that those who killed our people in Baisaran Valley … all three terrorists have been killed.”He added that “Operation Sindoor and Operation Mahadev have sent a clear message to the masterminds of terror about the consequences of playing with the lives of Indian citizens.”The three high-profile Lashkar terrorists were killed on July 28 in an encounter in the Dachigam forest near Srinagar, where they had been hiding since the April attack.","The Pahalgam massacre, one of the most horrifying attacks in recent years, shook the nation and ignited widespread grief and anger. India's zero-tolerance doctrine against terrorism became not just policy but a mindset. Operation Sindoor targeted terror infrastructure deep inside Pakistan and PoK, making this the first time India expanded its precision strikes beyond PoK into mainland Pakistan.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126273555,imgsize-760078,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: A government-constituted magisterial inquiry has found that the Goa nightclub where a devastating fire killed 25 people in early December was built illegally on a salt pan and operated for months without valid permissions, pointing to systemic failures and alleged collusion by local authorities, as reported by news agency PTI.The fire broke out late on December 6 during a crowded event after fireworks were set off without adequate safety measures or equipment. The club lacked emergency exits on both floors and was operating without valid permissions. The blaze killed 25 people, including tourists and staff.The report, made public on Wednesday, said the structure of the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub in Arpora, North Goa, stood in the middle of a salt pan or water body and was “not permissible under any law”, either current or past, violating the Goa Land Revenue Code and Coastal Zone Regulations.The inquiry revealed that the village panchayat issued an establishment licence to the operator in December 2023, valid only until March 31, 2024. Despite the licence not being renewed, the premises continued to function as a bar and nightclub, with no steps taken by the panchayat to seal it, even though the Goa Panchayat Raj Act empowers such action.Also read: Birch staff tried to douse fire with a glass and water bottle: Survivor Statements recorded during the probe showed that senior panchayat officials were aware of the lapse but failed to inform other departments, which continued granting permissions based on the expired trade licence.The report concluded that this amounted to collusion with the owners and a violation of conduct rules, PTI reported.Serious irregularities were also flagged in the original licensing process. The inquiry noted alleged forgery in the application, including entries added later in different ink, missing mandatory documents such as approved plans and land records, and a hurried approval process completed within days. Officials admitted they had not verified the house number or legality of the structure before issuing the licence.Despite multiple complaints over noise pollution and parking between January 2024 and December 2025, inspections repeatedly recorded “nothing found on the spot”, and directions of the Bombay High Court regarding night patrolling were not followed.Police have registered the case under several Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita sections, including culpable homicide not amounting to murder, negligence, forgery and criminal conspiracy.Eight people have been arrested so far, including co-owners Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra.",A government-constituted magisterial inquiry has found that the Goa nightclub where a devastating fire killed 25 people in early December was built illegally on a salt pan.

SRINAGAR: A sessions court in Jammu and Kashmir has acquitted three people arrested in 2022 for allegedly possessing arms, observing that the prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused were in “conscious and unauthorised possession” of the arms at the time of their arrest.Additional sessions judge Manjeet Rai on Tuesday said there was a “total absence of independent witnesses or corroborative evidence” to support the UAPA allegations of association with Al-Badr and an intended terrorist act.“Accordingly, all three accused, namely Wajid Ahmad Bhat, Masrat Bilal, and Rameez Ahmad Dar, are acquitted of all charges levelled against them in this case,” the court said, directing police to release them “forthwith, if not required in any other case.”As per the prosecution, during a checking operation at Batamaloo in Srinagar on Oct 10, 2022, the accused allegedly attempted to flee but were apprehended by police. One live grenade was recovered from Bhat, while another live grenade, an AK-47 magazine, and 30 live rounds were recovered from Bilal. Police claimed that Rs 47,500 in cash was recovered from Dar.The chargesheet said the accused disclosed that they were working as “terrorist associates” of Al-Badr and had received the arms and ammunition from a masked overground worker of the organisation in Kulgam in south Kashmir.However, the defence counsel argued that the entire case rested solely on police witnesses, without a single independent civilian witness, despite the admitted presence of a CRPF bunker and shops on three sides of the spot from where the accused were arrested.",A sessions court in Jammu and Kashmir has acquitted three people arrested in 2022 for allegedly possessing arms.

SRINAGAR: The J&K high court set aside Wednesday the conviction of an elderly woman in a 1979 murder case from Uri near the LoC in Baramulla district of north Kashmir, citing 46 years of prolonged proceedings and her age-related infirmities.A single-judge bench of Justice Sanjay Parihar ruled that the sentence of Shameema Begam should be treated as already undergone, saying no useful purpose would be served by maintaining a substantive jail term after decades of litigation. The court ordered closure of the case, while saying that “the offence was committed in a heat of passion without premeditation.”The killing dates back to July 10, 1979, when Begam of Bijhama village struck her mother-in-law with an axe during a domestic quarrel. The older woman had intervened in an argument when Begam was repeatedly asked to irrigate maize fields and later died of head wounds four days later.Begam was arrested on July 21, 1979, and released on bail on Oct 25 that year. Police registered an FIR at Bijhama police station under sections 326 and 324 of Ranbir Penal Code, the criminal law then in force in J&K under Dogra-era statutes. After the victim died, the charge was converted to murder under section 302 RPC.The trial dragged on for three decades. On July 16, 2009, a trial court convicted Begam under section 304 RPC, holding that the act was culpable homicide not amounting to murder, and sentenced her to five years of rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs 2,000. She was arrested after conviction but released on bail within days — on July 28, 2009.Begam appealed the verdict. The appeal remained pending for more than 16 years before coming up for final hearing. Her lawyer Nida Nazir said extraordinary delay in both trial and appeal violated Begam’s right to a speedy trial and warranted a sympathetic approach.HC called the case “a testimony to the systemic delay in the disposal of criminal cases”. While delay cannot ordinarily benefit a convict, the court said, it cannot ignore the reality of accused people remaining trapped in the criminal justice system for decades. “The appeal is accordingly disposed of,” the court said, bringing an end to one of Kashmir’s longest-running criminal cases.",Shameema Begam struck her mother-in-law with an axe during a domestic quarrel in 1979.

'Will Rid Bengal Of Infiltrators': Amit Shah Slams Mamata Banerjee’s 14-Year Rule, Sounds Poll Bugle

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday shared a video alleging that a woman and her family members were brutally assaulted with bamboo sticks in West Bengal’s South 24 Parganas district.The incident reportedly took place in Uttar Bhangnamari village under the Basanti block of the Canning sub-division.

Throwback 25: Five Indian Weapons That Crushed Terror And Dominated Pakistan in Operation Sindoor

NEW DELHI: Operation Sindoor stands as a ""resounding testament"" to India's unwavering resolve against terrorism, and with precision and professionalism, the Indian armed forces struck deep into the heart of Pakistan's terror infrastructure delivering a ""calibrated and decisive blow"", the defence ministry said on Wednesday.The operation sent an ""unambiguous message"" to the world -- ""India will not tolerate terror, and those who sponsor it will face the full force of retribution"", it said.""This operation would be remembered as a defining moment in India's military history and as a symbol of military precision and national resolve,"" the ministry said in a year-end review statement.Operation Sindoor was carried out in the early hours of May 7 eliminating at least 100 terrorists in response to the horrific Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 innocent civilians.Indian armed forces had launched a series of precision missile strikes on nine terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir under this military action, which resulted in a four-day conflict between India and Pakistan.The ministry said the operation stands as a ""resounding testament to India's unwavering resolve against terrorism -- a bold demonstration of decisive leadership, joint operational synergy and the nation's intent to safeguard its sovereignty against brutal killings by Pakistan-based terrorists"".The operation showcased ""unmatched multi-domain capability"" and was executed simultaneously across the traditional domains of land, maritime and air as well as the emerging domains of cyber, space and information warfare.""With strategic foresight and restraint of the forces, Operation Sindoor highlighted India's sustained focus on capability development, i.e., from intelligence dominance to cutting-edge technology and joint operational readiness,"" the ministry said.The operation was a ""classic demonstration of execution of will of the nation"" through ""seamless integration of all organs of the government"". The success of home-grown technologies and weapon systems in combat was validation of the success of the vision of 'Aatmanirbharta' espoused by India, it said.Operation Sindoor also marked a milestone in India's journey towards technological self-reliance in military operations -- whether in drone warfare, layered air defence, or electronic warfare. It was also a shining example of tri-Service coordination, the ministry said.While the Indian Air Force launched attacks from the air, the Army soldiers stood firmly on the Line of Control and ""delivered a befitting reply to every Pakistani action"", the statement said.The Indian Navy maintained its strong posture in the north Arabian Sea, ""sending a clear message to Pakistan that India is capable and prepared to strike at every vital Pakistani base, from sea to land, the ministry quoted an earlier statement of Defence Minister Rajnath Singh.Singh had told Parliament that Operation Sindoor had only been halted, and not ended, it said.""If Pakistan again tries to carry out any nefarious act, we are fully prepared for an even more intense and decisive action,"" Singh had said.The ministry said Operation Sindoor was powered by the country's ""transitional shift in its policy against terrorism"".From successfully destroying terror camps in Pakistan and PoK and safeguarding the borders from the ""neighbouring country's misdeeds that followed"", the nation, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the guidance of Defence Minister Singh, ""sent a clear message to its adversaries that the sovereignty, unity and integrity of Bharat will never be compromised"", it said.Singh had also said that the action was completely in self-defence, and was ""neither provocative nor expansionist"".On May 10, at approximately 1:30 am, Pakistan launched a ""massive attack"" on IAF bases, army ammunition depots, airports, and military cantonments using missiles, drones, rockets, and other long-range weapons, along with electronic warfare technologies, it said.However, the Indian air defence system, counter-drone system, and electronic equipment ""completely thwarted the attack by Pakistan"". The adversary failed to hit any targets, and none of the vital assets were damaged, the ministry said.""Major airbases like Chaklala, Sargodha, Rafiqui, Rahimyar Khan, Jacobabad, Sukkur, and Bholari were struck, and the mission was successfully accomplished. On May 10, Pakistan's DGMO contacted India's DGMO and appealed for a halt to military operations. On May 12, formal talks took place between the two DGMOs, and both sides decided to cease military operations,"" it added.The effective use of state-of-the-art 'Made-in-India' weapons during the operation is testimony to the progress the country has made to attain self-reliance, which, in today's geopolitical landscape, is ""fundamental to ensuring strategic autonomy"".From Operation Sindoor to Mission Sudarshan Chakra vision, from record defence production and exports to equipping the soldiers with latest weapons and technologies, and finalising deals for the future, ""2025 gave a glimpse of a secure, self-reliant and prosperous India,"" it said.","Operation Sindoor was carried out in the early hours of May 7 eliminating at least 100 terrorists.

'Deeply Concerned': PM Modi Reacts To Reports Of Attack On Putin’s House, Ukraine Responds

Russia claims Putin targetted in attack

Third day of powercuts for Ukrainians after Russian attack

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday expressed concern over reports that the residence of Russian President Vladimir Putin had been targeted and called for restraint and a renewed focus on diplomacy.In a post on X, PM Modi said he was 'deeply concerned' by the reports and stressed that diplomatic engagement remained the best way forward. ""Deeply concerned by reports of the targeting of the residence of the President of the Russian Federation. Ongoing diplomatic efforts offer the most viable path toward ending hostilities and achieving peace. We urge all concerned to remain focused on these efforts and to avoid any actions that could undermine them,"" he said.Russia earlier claimed that Ukraine had launched a drone attack on President Putin’s state residence located between Moscow and St Petersburg. According to Reuters, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov alleged that 91 long-range drones were fired at the residence in the Novgorod region on December 28–29, all of which were intercepted and destroyed by Russian air defences.Lavrov described the incident as a “terrorist attack” and said Moscow would revise its negotiating position on ending the Ukraine war.He added that Russia had already selected targets in Ukraine for what he called “retaliation strikes.”Ukraine rejected the accusation. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dismissed Russia’s claims as “lies,” alleging that Moscow was using the narrative to justify further attacks on Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv. “This alleged ‘residence strike’ story is a complete fabrication intended to justify additional attacks against Ukraine, as well as Russia’s refusal to take necessary steps to end the war,” Zelenskyy said.He added that Ukraine does not take actions that undermine diplomacy, accusing Russia of doing the opposite, and urged the international community not to remain silent as efforts continue toward achieving a lasting peace.For three days following the latest Russian air attacks on Ukraine, residents have been without electricity or heating in Vyshhorod, a satellite town about 20 km north of Kyiv.As night-time temperatures fall to around minus 3 degrees Celsius, they spend much of the day in a small shelter equipped with heat and electricity, where they can also power their gadgets and devices.Around 20 people gather in the modest building—described on a sign outside as an “islet of warmth and power”—charging mobile phones and laptops to stay connected and continue working.","PM Modi says he is 'deeply concerned' by reports of the targeting of the residence of the President of the Russian Federation.

Chicken’s Neck Threat Sparks Sharp Reply As Nagaland Minister Warns Bangladesh Radicals Boldly

GUWAHATI: Assam police busted a module of Imam Mahmuder Kafila (IMK) with the arrest of 11 alleged operatives of the Bangladesh-based Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) offshoot formed in 2018. Investigators said IMK expanded its base in the state after Bangladesh's Aug 2024 regime change that led to the exit of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.Of the 11 people held by Assam police's Special Task Force (STF), 10 were picked up from Assam and one from Tripura in operations since late Monday night. CM Himanta Biswa Sarma acknowledged the threat from such modules. ""Fundamentalists are definitely active in Assam. The issue will remain for long as Bangladesh is Assam's neighbouring country,"" Sarma said.STF chief and Guwahati police commissioner Partha Sarathi Mahanta said IMK used encrypted social media groups to radicalise and recruit youths in Assam and nearby states, spread propaganda, raise funds through hawala and UPI channels, and facilitate cross-border travel for training.""Probe revealed that following the regime change in Bangladesh in Aug 2024, top leaders of JMB, Ansarullah Bangla Team (ABT) and al-Qaida in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) issued directions to IMK leadership to activate and expand its Indian modules.Bangladeshi nationals Umar and Khalid were assigned to coordinate Assam-based activities. The head of the Assam cell is one Nasim Uddin alias Tamim of Barpeta Road in Barpeta district in Assam,"" Mahanta said.Nasim Uddin was among those 11 arrested. Multiple charges under BNS, 2023 and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967 were slapped on the suspects.Mahanta said IMK, banned in India, was formed by Jewel Mahmud alias Imam Mahmud Habibullah alias Sohail, described as a former JMB member who claims to be the amir (leader) of IMK and propagates the ideology of ""Ghazwatul Hind (Battle against India)"".Mahanta said IMK propagated an ideology aligned with proscribed transnational jihadi organisations and operated through secure social media platforms. ""One such social media group is 'Purva Akash', which functions as a principal communication and recruitment platform. People from Assam, Bengal and Tripura were being radicalised, recruited, financially mobilised. IMK disseminates extremist propaganda advocating violent jihad and the armed conquest of India. ""Investigators found that some Assam-based IMK operatives had travelled to Bangladesh earlier this year on valid passports and visas for training and coordination, Mahanta further said.",Assam police arrest 11 alleged operatives of the Bangladesh-based Jamaat-ul- Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) offshoot formed in 2018.

NEW DELHI: The Army has launched a training programme for the Village Defence Guards (VDG) in Jammu and Kashmir amid the ongoing counter-terrorism operation in the higher reaches of Chenab valley.According to the Army, around 15 Village Defence Guards, including women volunteers, are undergoing intensive training in handling automatic rifles, minor tactics, self-defence, bunker construction and repelling enemy attacks, they said.Officials told news agency PTI that the raining is being conducted at Shingini panchayat of Balassa, around 90 km from the Doda district headquarters. It aims to equip volunteers with the necessary skills to protect their villages and act as a first line of defence, especially in vulnerable areas.The move complements the ongoing operation by the Army, police and paramilitary forces in the higher reaches to track down and neutralise the terrorists who had managed to infiltrate into Chenab valley, especially Doda and Kishtwar districts, a couple of years back, officials added.The VDGs welcomed the training and the recent upgradation of their weaponry. They expressed gratitude to Union Home Minister Amit Shah for providing self-loading rifles (SLRs), replacing the older .303 rifles, which they said, has significantly boosted their confidence.""This is a major programme bringing together members from 17 Village Defence Groups. We are being trained in weapon handling, bunker construction and self-defence. Receiving such training at our doorstep is highly appreciable,"" Surinder Singh, a VDG member from Shingani, said.He requested the government to provide more automatic weapons to the members, recalling the frequent terror attacks in the region during the early 1990s.Another VDG member, Rajesh Kumar Thakur from Gauala village, said the training by the Army and Jammu and Kashmir Police has instilled a sense of confidence.""Earlier, we only had .303 rifles. After receiving automatic weapons, our confidence has increased, and we now feel capable of defending our villages,"" he said.This comes as he Army has intensified its counter-terrorism operations across the Kishtwar and Doda districts amid the ongoing Chillai Kalan — the 40-day bone-chilling winter period — in Jammu and Kashmir.According to sources, various intelligence agencies asses that there are approximately 30 to 35 Pakistani terrorists currently in the Jammu region.Inputs gathered over the past few months suggest that these groups, finding themselves cornered by successful counter-terror operations, have shifted deeper into higher and middle mountain reaches of the region — areas now devoid of habitation. These terrorists are believed to be seeking temporary winter hideouts to evade detection and avoid direct confrontation with security troops, they added.Meanwhile, the Army and security forces have also adopted a proactive winter posture, establishing temporary bases and surveillance posts deep within snow-covered areas to maintain continuous pressure on potential terrorist hideouts.",The Army has launched a training programme for the Village Defence Guards (VDG) in Jammu and Kashmir.

NEW DELHI: Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi has claimed that Beijing mediated several global conflicts, including the standoff between India and Pakistan in May following the Pahalgam terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir.Speaking at the Symposium on the International Situation and China’s Foreign Relations on Tuesday, Wang said Beijing had taken an “objective and just stance” to build peace and focused on addressing “both symptoms and root causes”.“This year, local wars and cross-border conflicts flared up more often than at any time since the end of WWII. Geopolitical turbulence continued to spread,” Wang said at the symposium in Beijing.“To build peace that lasts, we have taken an objective and just stance, and focused on addressing both symptoms and root causes. Following this Chinese approach to settling hotspot issues, we mediated in northern Myanmar, the Iranian nuclear issue, the tensions between Pakistan and India, the issues between Palestine and Israel, and the recent conflict between Cambodia and Thailand,” he said.The statement comes despite Beijing’s role during the May 7–10 Operation Sindoor conflict between India and Pakistan coming under serious scrutiny and criticism, particularly over alleged military assistance provided by China to Islamabad.After the conflict flared up, Deputy Chief of Army Staff Lt General Rahul R Singh had said Beijing used the confrontation as a “live lab”, while declining to directly elaborate on the charge.Gen Singh said China’s strategy during Operation Sindoor was based on its ancient military doctrine of the “36 stratagems”, accusing Beijing of seeking to hurt India by “killing with a borrowed knife” — a reference to alleged Chinese support to Pakistan.Meanwhile, the Indian Army on Tuesday hailed Operation Sindoor, underlining ten major milestones achieved by the force in 2025.“Nine terrorist camps across the border were destroyed. The Indian Army neutralised seven camps, while the remaining two were destroyed by the Indian Air Force. Pakistan attempted to target military and civilian assets using drones, but Indian Army air defence units successfully neutralised all threats, preventing damage and casualties. More than a dozen terror launch pads along the Line of Control were destroyed using Indian Army ground-based weapons,” the Army said.“The director general of military operations of the Indian Army was approached by his Pakistani counterpart with a request for a ceasefire. An understanding was reached to stop firing and military action,” it added.India and Pakistan were locked in a brief but intense military confrontation in May, triggered by a terror attack in the Pahalgam valley of Jammu and Kashmir on April 22, which claimed 26 innocent lives.India responded with Operation Sindoor, targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.India has consistently dismissed claims of any third-party mediation, maintaining that the four-day confrontation was resolved through direct military-to-military communication.New Delhi has maintained that after sustaining heavy damage, Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) called his Indian counterpart, and both sides agreed to stop all firing and military action on land, air and sea with effect from May 10.","Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi claims Beijing mediated several global conflicts, including the standoff between India and Pakistan in May.

'Called Minor Matter, Refused FIR': Tripura Student Angel Chakma's Father Blasts Uttarakhand Police

DEHRADUN: The family of Anjel Chakma, the young Tripura native killed in Dehradun earlier this month, pushed back sharply against the city police chief's public dismissal of racial slurs as a motive behind the murder - a claim central to the family's version of events and backed, they say, by the firsthand account of Anjel's brother, Michael, who witnessed the attack.Momen Chakma, Anjel's uncle and among the first relatives to arrive in the city after the assault, said the police were choosing to ignore the words of the only eyewitness. ""Michael is not just a family member, he's the complainant in the case. He was there when it happened. The incident lasted minutes - how do you expect anyone to stop and film something like that?"" he told TOI Tuesday. ""Instead of listening to the person who saw it unfold, they are issuing public statements without even completing the investigation. ""Faced with mounting questions, Dehradun SSP Ajai Singh clarified Tuesday that Michael's complaint only mentioned ""casteist slurs"". He said, ""The family stayed in Dehradun until Dec 27 but did not mention racial slurs to the police...If they want to share additional information, we are open to including it in the probe.""If the family of Tripura native Anjel Chakma is saying this (racial slurs motive behind the murder) now, we are not aware of it.However, the case is still under investigation,"" Dehradun SSP Ajai Singh said. Police were gathering all possible evidence to build a strong case before filing the chargesheet, he added. Dehradun police, citing ethnic background of some of the accused, had said they found no indication of racial provocation in the case. The family, still grieving, called this ""premature and deeply dismissive"".Anjel, 24, and his younger brother Michael, were in Dehradun when they were allegedly attacked by a group of six men after objecting to their disruptive behaviour. According to Michael and other family members, the attackers shouted racial slurs - words like ""chinki"", ""Chinese"", and ""momo"" - before turning violent. Michael sustained injuries, and Anjel later died of his wounds. ""It's not just about one word or one insult,"" Momen said.

Jaishankar To Attend Khaleda Zia's Funeral In Dhaka Amid Strained India-Bangladesh Ties

Bangladesh's first woman PM to embattled mass leader

JALPAIGURI: Grief over former Bangladesh PM Khaleda Zia's death on Tuesday travelled well beyond Dhaka, reaching Jalpaiguri, a north Bengal town nearly 434 km away, where memories of her early life still lingered. For the people here, it was a loss of one of their own.Khaleda Zia was born in Jalpaiguri in 1946 and spent her early life in the town, attending two primary schools before her family eventually moved to what was then East Pakistan, now Bangladesh.""Zia's father, Mohammad Iskandar, used to work as an agent at my father's tea trading firm, Das & Co. Khaleda Zia was born at their Nayabasti house in the town. Even after Partition, her family continued to reside in Jalpaiguri, and family moved to erstwhile East Pakistan only in the 1950s,"" recounted Jalpaiguri resident and businessman Nilanjan Dasgupta.According to Jalpaiguri-based historian Umesh Sharma, Zia's early education began in the town. ""Zia was sent to Jogmaya Primary School in Nayabasti, where she studied up to Class III, and was then admitted to Sunitibala Sadar Girls' School in Samaj Para,"" he said. ""By then most of their relatives moved to East Pakistan, and Zia's father migrated there,"" Sharma added.Sharma said the family's departure followed a formal exchange of property.""Iskandar went for a property exchange with one Amarendranath Chakraborty and moved to East Pakistan. Chakraborty's family still lives in the house at Nayabasti,"" he said.Those who remember her family recall the emotional ties that endured long after her departure. ""Siyon Mandal, who became a teacher at Sishu Niketan Prathamik Bidyalaya, was her best friend during primary school days. I remember how Siyondi was elated when Zia came to office in Bangladesh. The news of her demise has left people who knew her sorry,"" said Dasgupta, a former proprietor of now-defunct Das & Co.Neighbours, too, spoke of a bond that survived borders and decades. ""Zia's niece came only a couple of months ago to see Zia's birthplace. We talked about how good it would have been if the country was never partitioned. Her loss is mourned by people in Bangladesh as well as here,"" said Suhrid Mandal, Zia's Jalpaiguri neighbour.","Khaleda Zia was born in Jalpaiguri in 1946 and spent her early life in the town.

Candace Owens’ SHOCKING Declaration After 4.5-Hour Meeting With Charlie Kirk’s Widow Erika | Watch

Candace Owens, Cabot Phillips, and the Charlie Kirk claims explained





Candace Owens and Cabot Phillips became the center of a big online storm after a murder theory started trending on X. The theory tried to link Cabot Phillips to claims about Charlie Kirk . Very quickly, the posts spread, and many people began sharing screenshots, old videos, and timelines.But here is the most important thing first. Charlie Kirk is alive. There has been no murder or assassination. The claims spreading online are theories shared on social media, not facts. This point matters because much of the discussion grew from confusion and viral posts rather than confirmed reporting.Candace Owens used her X account to question timelines and appearances shown on shows linked to The Daily Wire. She also reacted to posts that claimed Cabot Phillips was in certain places before events connected to Turning Point USA. As the topic trended, Phillips publicly denied the claims and shared personal details to explain where he actually was. The back-and-forth kept the topic alive on X and pulled in many well-known conservative media names.Cabot Phillips is a senior editor at The Daily Wire. Before this role, he worked as editor-in-chief at Campus Reform. He is also active on social media, where his videos often get millions of views.Candace Owens claimed online that Phillips was somehow connected to a murder theory involving Charlie Kirk. These claims focused on dates, locations, and media appearances. One post suggested that Phillips had contact with Turning Point USA members before a major event. Owens also questioned clips from Daily Wire shows, pointing to changes in Phillips’ beard to argue that some episodes were pre-recorded.Phillips responded directly on X. He denied being at Fort Huachuca and said he had never been there. He wrote in a full post:“I was not at Ft. Huachuca on 9/8 or 9/9. I’ve never been. I was home in Nashville both days. On the afternoon of the 8th, I attended an ultrasound with my wife and stopped to get balloons for a gender reveal with our son that evening. It’s a boy if anyone was wondering!”Owens later questioned the images and videos Phillips shared and asked him to send them to her directly so she could check the metadata. She also discussed Daily Wire programming and timelines. On December 31, she confirmed that Phillips contacted her and explained that some shows were recorded earlier, which addressed part of her concern.The entire debate played out on X (formerly Twitter), with users taking sides, sharing clips, and pushing the topic into trending lists. As of now, there is no proof backing any murder theory. Charlie Kirk remains alive, and no official source has reported otherwise. Sources for statements in this story include posts from Candace Owens’ X account and Cabot Phillips’ X account.Also Read: “Just Retire”: Candace Owens Fires Back At Alex Jones Over Deep State Claims And Charlie Kirk Killing Debate","Candace Owens and Cabot Phillips became the center of a big online storm after a murder theory started trending on X.

Nick Shirley responds to race claims, Somali community concerns, and Tim Walz comments





Nick Shirley did not expect his phone to keep buzzing all day. But after his Minnesota daycare video went viral, that is exactly what happened. The 23-year-old content creator posted a video showing daycare centers that receive federal money but, he says, do not actually care for children. The clip spread fast online and quickly turned into a heated debate.While filming, YouTuber Nick Shirley was stopped by a local man who accused him of racism. The man said Shirley was attacking the Somali community and putting them in danger. Shirley pushed back right away. He said his work was not about race or religion. He said it was about money and fraud.A short clip of this exchange was shared on X by Collin Rugg and gained wide attention. Soon after, the issue reached national TV. Shirley appeared on Fox News and spoke about Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and his past comments on race. As reactions grew stronger, Shirley promised that part two of his daycare investigation would be released soon.During the video, the unidentified man accused Nick Shirley of harming the Somali community. He said the video was being used by hateful people online. He told Shirley, “This absolutely has to do with us being Muslim and us being from Africa.”He also claimed online comments showed calls to remove Muslims from Minnesota and warned, “You are preparing for the Somali community to maybe be taken to concentration camps. ”Nick Shirley rejected that claim clearly. He responded, “This has nothing to do with race. This is fraud.” When accused of making the issue bigger than it is, Shirley repeated, “This is fraud. You are defending fraud.”After the video went viral, Shirley appeared on Fox News. He spoke about comments made by Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. Walz had earlier spoken about race and immigration and said, as quoted by Newsweek, “This is what happens when they scapegoat, and this is what happens when they no longer hide the idea of white supremacy.”On Fox News, Nick Shirley said Tim Walz was using race to avoid the real issue. He claimed the state allowed fraud to continue and said leaders were chasing votes. Shirley later posted a clip on his X account and wrote, “Calling people ‘white supremacist’, ‘racist’, ‘Nazi’, and ‘fascist’ used to work. It doesn’t work anymore.” He also confirmed that part two of his investigation is coming soon.Also Read: Nick Shirley Puts Tim Walz Under Fire After Minnesota Childcare Licensing Page Suddenly Goes Offline Amid Daycare Fraud Claim","Nick Shirley, 23, posted a video showing daycare centers that receive federal money but, he says, do not actually care for children.

Xi STUNNED As Taiwan Declares 'No Return To China'; Japan 'SCHOOLS' Beijing | Big War Looms?

Military pressure and Taiwan’s response

International criticism and Beijing’s rebuttal





China’s President Xi Jinping said that the “reunification of our motherland, a trend of the times, is unstoppable” in his 2026 New Year message, delivered just hours after Beijing announced the conclusion of large-scale live-fire military drills around Taiwan.Xi’s remarks came as China’s military said it had “successfully completed” exercises designed to simulate a blockade of the self-ruled island and strikes on maritime targets. While Xi did not mention Taiwan directly in his address, his language echoed long-standing claims over the island, which Beijing considers part of its territory despite never having ruled it.Xi also used the speech to frame 2025 as a landmark year, marking the completion of China’s 14th Five-Year Plan and the 80th anniversary of the victory in the Chinese People’s War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War. He said China’s economic strength, technological capabilities, defence capacity and overall national power had all reached “new heights”, adding that these developments were “rallying a mighty force for the great rejuvenation of our nation”.The drills, code-named “Justice Mission 2025”, involved missiles, fighter jets, bombers, navy ships and coastguard vessels operating around Taiwan over two days. China’s People’s Liberation Army said the exercises tested sea-air coordination, integrated blockade capabilities and joint strike operations, including live-fire training in waters north and south of the island.Taiwan condemned the manoeuvres as “highly provocative and reckless”. Its defence ministry said some Chinese live rounds landed closer to the island than in previous exercises, with several rockets falling within Taiwan’s 24-nautical-mile zone. President Lai Ching-te warned that the drills were “not an isolated incident” and posed “significant risks” to regional stability, global shipping and trade.Taipei said Chinese warships and coastguard vessels began withdrawing on Wednesday, though Taiwan’s coastguard maintained deployments at sea, citing the need to remain vigilant. Taiwanese authorities also reported major disruption to civil aviation, with hundreds of flights delayed or cancelled due to temporary danger zones declared during the drills.China accused Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party of pursuing separatism and relying on foreign support, particularly arms sales from the United States. Beijing has vowed to seize the island by force if necessary and continues to send aircraft and naval vessels towards Taiwan on a near-daily basis.Also read: The ‘second fiddle’ fantasy: Why the US and India won’t bow to China The exercises drew sharp criticism from several countries. Japan said the drills increased tensions across the Taiwan Strait, while Australia described them as “destabilising”. The Philippines said it was deeply concerned about actions that could undermine regional peace and stability.Beijing dismissed the criticism as “irresponsible”. Foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian accused other countries of ignoring what he called separatist attempts in Taiwan while condemning China’s “necessary and just actions” to defend its sovereignty. He said such criticism distorted facts and was “utterly hypocritical”.","China's President Xi Jinping said that the “reunification of our motherland, a trend of the times, is unstoppable” in his 2026 New Year message.

Can the US revoke citizenship? Trump administration weighs denaturalisation in Minnesota fraud case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/can-the-us-revoke-citizenship-trump-administration-weighs-denaturalisation-in-minnesota-fraud-case/articleshow/126278329.cms,"Minnesota Crackdown: DOJ Raids Somali-Americans, 100 Arrested In Shocking Med 'Fraud'





The Trump administration was exploring the denaturalisation of Somali-Americans in Minnesota who engaged in fraud, a move that would seek to strip US citizenship from those who illegally obtained tax dollars intended for social services.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt discussed the potential action in a December 31 appearance on Fox News, one day after the US Department of Health and Human Services froze childcare payments to Minnesota following what the agency said was fraud at daycares in the state.""We're also not afraid to use denaturalization,"" Leavitt said. ""That's a tool at the president and the secretary of state's disposal, and it's one this administration has previously used before.""""Absolutely,"" Leavitt said when asked whether Trump wanted Somali-Americans' citizenship revoked if they were convicted of fraud. “It’s something the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State is currently looking at right now.""Federal prosecutors charged 86 individuals with felonies for exploiting federal tax dollars intended to help hungry children during the COVID-19 pandemic for personal gain.More than 60 pleaded guilty or were convicted so far. The case was originally brought by the Biden administration, US Today reported.Of the 86 people charged in a sprawling $250 million case involving Minnesota-administered programmes, 78 were identified as Somali-Americans. Minnesota was home to about 80,000 Somali immigrants, the largest of any state. Most were naturalised citizens, foreign-born individuals who went through a legal process to gain their citizenship.Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, in a December 30 appearance on The Charlie Kirk Show podcast, said DHS investigators were currently going ""door to door"" to suspected fraud sites in Minnesota ""to make sure we follow the money here and we bring arrests, prosecutions and ultimately removals.""The White House also seized on a recent viral video from conservative influencer Nick Shirley that claimed abandoned daycare centres were receiving millions in state taxpayer dollars. FBI Director Kash Patel on Dec. 28 said his agency had ""surged personnel and investigative resources to Minnesota to dismantle large-scale fraud schemes exploiting federal programs.""Stripping citizenship from naturalised US citizens was rare and had a high bar. Federal courts, not the administration, made the final decisions. Denaturalisation could be pursued through either civil proceedings or a criminal conviction.During President Donald Trump's first term in office, the Justice Department filed 168 denaturalisation cases in federal court, while the Biden administration filed 64 such cases, a database created by Irina Mantra, a Hofstra University law professor, found. An average of 11 denaturalisation cases per year were filed between 1990 and 2007.The general grounds for denaturalisation involved the ""illegal procurement of naturalization"" or the ""concealment of a material fact or willful misrepresentation,"" according to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services, a federal agency. In addition, the federal govt could cite an individual's current or past affiliation with a totalitarian political party or terrorist organisation.Demonstrators rallied in protest against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), amid a reported federal immigration operation targeting the Somali community, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, US, December 8, 2025.Trump called Somali immigrants in Minnesota ""garbage,"" igniting pushback from immigrant rights advocates who argued the White House's focus on the Minnesota fraud case was an excuse to target the immigrant population. Trump and Republicans blamed Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the 2024 Democratic vice presidential nominee, for allowing the fraud to unfold.Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minnesota, a close ally of Trump, called for the denaturalisation of Somali-Americans convicted of fraud in a Dec. 30 post on Facebook.“I have three words regarding Somalis who have committed fraud against American taxpayers: Send them home. If they’re here illegally, deport them immediately; if they’re naturalized citizens, revoke their citizenship and deport them quickly thereafter,"" Emmer said.","White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt discussed the potential action in a December 31 appearance on Fox News.

YouTuber Nick Shirley accuses Minnesota leaders and faces backlash from Somali community





Nick Shirley is a 23-year-old YouTuber from California. He is now at the center of a big national debate. On December 25, 2025, Nick Shirley posted a long video about daycare centers in Minnesota. In the video, he walked into buildings listed as active daycares. He said he found no children, no toys, and no staff. In one clip, he clearly said, “WHERE ARE THE CHILDREN?”Nick Shirley claimed these centers were getting millions of dollars from the state through the Child Care Assistance Program, also called CCAP. This program helps low-income families pay for child care. Nick Shirley said some centers were taking money without actually caring for children. The video spread fast online. It caught the attention of big political leaders and federal agencies. Soon after, federal investigators started looking into the claims, and Minnesota’s childcare funding came under review.Nick Shirley said the problem could be worth close to a billion dollars. He also blamed Minnesota leaders, including Governor Tim Walz, for failing to act sooner. His video went viral on X. His follower count jumped from about 200,000 to more than 800,000 in just days.High-profile figures shared the video. Elon Musk reposted it while talking about government waste. Vice President JD Vance also reacted publicly. After the video gained traction, federal agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, began reviewing the claims. Parts of Minnesota’s childcare funding were paused while checks were carried out.The controversy also sparked anger. Nick Shirley was confronted outside one location. A man shouted, “How much money are you making? How much money are you making off of this?” Nick replied, “This is about fraud. You’re defending fraud.” Critics say the video unfairly targets Somali Americans, since some daycare owners belong to that community. Nick Shirley has denied this. He has said many times that the issue is about public money, not race or religion.Some experts and local leaders questioned Nick Shirley’s methods. They said he did not check records for every site and entered some buildings without permission. Police asked him to leave one location for trespassing. Still, Minnesota Republican leaders confirmed they shared information with him, and state inspectors were sent out to check licensed centers.Nick Shirley has also said he fears for his safety. He claims he has received threats and is being followed. His family has publicly supported him. He says a second video is coming as federal investigations continue. The case now sits at the center of politics, public trust, and community tension across the country.Also Read: “This Is Fraud”: Nick Shirley Responds After Minnesota Daycare Video Sparks Race Claims And Somali Community Debate","Nick Shirley is a 23-year-old YouTuber from California.

Calling the detail “eerie,” Hilton emphasized how it raises questions about intent, despite authorities confirming a knife was used. He also noted the emotional toll on the community as the investigation continues.

Perez Hilton reacts to Nick Reiner gun interest reports







Shock rippled through Hollywood this week as new details emerged in the murder case involving Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele. Perez Hilton reacts to Nick Reiner gun interest reports by capturing the unease many felt when learning about what allegedly crossed the suspect’s mind before the killings. The timing of those revelations has only deepened the sense of dread surrounding a case that already defies belief.Hilton addressed the reports directly on his website, drawing attention to the unsettling contrast between speculation and confirmed facts. While authorities say Rob and Michele Reiner were fatally stabbed inside their Brentwood home on December 14, the idea that their son may have been thinking about firearms beforehand added a disturbing psychological layer to the narrative. Hilton’s reaction struck a chord because it focused less on shock value and more on what intent can reveal.In his commentary, Hilton wrote, “Nick Reiner expressed an interest in buying a gun before allegedly murdering his parents, Rob and Michele….Jeez. So eerie.” He noted that official records confirm a knife was used, not a gun, yet emphasized how the reported interest in a firearm raised troubling questions.Citing sources close to the investigation, Hilton said Nick Reiner had allegedly “entertained the idea of getting a firearm,” though authorities have not confirmed whether any steps were taken to obtain one.Hilton leaned heavily on the emotional impact of that detail. He quoted a source describing how quickly events escalated, adding, “Everything escalated incredibly quickly. He wasn’t panicked — he was focused, and that’s what makes it so disturbing.” Another source framed the concern more starkly, saying, “The concern isn’t what he had; it’s what he was thinking about in those final days.”Beyond legal angles, Hilton highlighted the human fallout. Friends and neighbors remain shaken, many still struggling to process what happened. Hilton described the tragedy as “truly devastating,” pointing to reports that Nick Reiner had long battled mental health and addiction issues, including treatment for schizophrenia.Nick Reiner is also being held without bail awaiting his arraignment on January 7 as investigators keep putting the puzzle of the last hours before the killings together. Hilton left by saying that the case seems to have no conclusion, not only on the legal side but also on the emotional front of a community that was still left in need of answers.Also Read: “Backtracking on her praise”: Perez Hilton calls out Chappell Roan for deleting Brigitte Bardot tribute","Perez Hilton reacted to reports that Nick Reiner showed interest in owning a gun.

Saudi-UAE Clash: MBS' Ultimatum To Al Nahyan After Blowing Up Weapons | ‘Don’t Cross Our Red Line!’

What happened in Mukalla

What is the STC?

A ‘red line’ between Saudi and UAE

What the UAE said

Why the east matters to Riyadh

Yemen’s leadership steps in

Why this matters for Yemen

(With inputs from agencies)





Saudi Arabia’s airstrikes on Yemen’s southern port city of Mukalla this week have exposed a sharp and public rupture inside what was once a unified Gulf-backed coalition.What began as a complex war against the Iran-aligned Houthi movement has now evolved into an open confrontation between partners who once fought on the same side.The strikes followed the arrival of two vessels from the UAE port of Fujairah, which Saudi Arabia says unloaded weapons and armoured vehicles destined for the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC), a separatist force seeking self-rule in southern Yemen. Riyadh described the shipments as an “imminent threat” to its national security and warned that Emirati actions were “extremely dangerous”, language that underscored the seriousness of the fallout.At the heart of the dispute lies Saudi Arabia’s fear that instability in Yemen’s eastern provinces, particularly Hadramout and al-Mahra, could spill directly onto its borders.Saudi warplanes struck targets in Mukalla after the Saudi-led coalition accused two ships of arriving without authorisation, disabling their tracking systems and unloading “a large amount of weapons and combat vehicles” to support the STC.Riyadh said the operation was limited, conducted overnight, and aimed at preventing collateral damage.“The crews had the disabled tracking devices aboard the vessels and unloaded a large amount of weapons and combat vehicles in support of Southern Transitional Council’s forces,” the coalition said. “Considering that the aforementioned weapons constitute an imminent threat, and an escalation that threatens peace and stability, the Coalition Air Force has conducted this morning a limited airstrike.”Footage aired by Yemeni state media showed black smoke rising from the port and burned vehicles near the docks. Saudi state media said there were no casualties, though local residents reported damage to nearby homes.The Southern Transitional Council (STC) is a separatist movement in southern Yemen that seeks autonomy or independence for the region. It was formed in May 2017 following mass protests in the southern port city of Aden over the dismissal of its leader, Aidarus al-Zoubaidi, who now heads the council.The STC’s stated goal is to “reinstate the Southern State”, referring to the independent country that existed in South Yemen between 1967 and unification with the north in 1990. Support for southern secession has long existed, but gained momentum after Yemen’s civil war erupted in 2014.Backed by the United Arab Emirates, the STC controls key territory in the south, including Aden, and commands armed forces known as the Southern Armed Forces. While it has at times shared power with Yemen’s internationally recognised government, its core demand for southern self-rule remains unchanged.The STC now faces a critical test. It is part of the Presidential Leadership Council, yet its forces have seized swathes of territory from Saudi-backed units. Its leadership insists the UAE remains a “main partner” in the fight against the Houthis and has rejected Al-Alimi’s orders, saying they lack consensus.While the STC has framed its advance as consolidating southern control, defying Riyadh carries risks. Saudi Arabia controls Yemen’s airspace and has made clear it will act to prevent any shift that threatens its security interests.Saudi Arabia and the UAE were once the twin pillars of the coalition formed in 2015 to restore Yemen’s internationally recognised government after the Houthis seized the capital, Sanaa. While both opposed the Houthis, their long-term goals increasingly diverged.Riyadh has remained committed to a unified Yemen under the internationally recognised government. Abu Dhabi, by contrast, has backed the STC, which seeks to revive the formerly independent state of South Yemen. That divergence has now erupted into open confrontation.Saudi Arabia accused the UAE of pressuring the STC to carry out military operations near its borders, calling such actions a “threat to the kingdom’s national security”. “The Kingdom stresses that any threat to its national security is a red line,” the Saudi foreign ministry said, adding that it would not hesitate to act.The UAE rejected the accusations, saying the shipment “did not contain any weapons” and that the vehicles were intended for Emirati forces operating in Yemen. It condemned any attempt to implicate it in operations threatening Saudi security and called for restraint and coordination.The UAE said it was surprised by the Saudi airstrike and rejected allegations that it directed STC military operations.“The UAE categorically rejects any attempt to implicate it in the tensions between Yemeni parties,” its foreign ministry said, calling for restraint and coordination.Abu Dhabi said its presence in Yemen was at the invitation of the internationally recognised government and within the Saudi-led coalition framework. It urged that recent developments be handled “responsibly and in a way that prevents escalation”.Later in the day, the UAE announced that it would withdraw its remaining forces from Yemen.""The Ministry of Defence announces the termination of the remaining counterterrorism teams in Yemen,"" a statement from the ministry said, as cited by news agency AFP.The focus on Hadramout and al-Mahra is no coincidence. Hadramout borders Saudi Arabia and has deep economic and historical ties with the kingdom. Al-Mahra sits astride key land routes linking Yemen to Oman and Saudi Arabia and controls vital ports and crossings.For Riyadh, large-scale instability in the east is not a distant Yemeni problem but a direct border security issue. Saudi officials fear that unchecked STC expansion could redraw control over resource-rich areas and trade routes, creating long-term insecurity along the kingdom’s southern frontier.This explains why Saudi Arabia warned the STC against advancing into Hadramout and demanded a withdrawal, a call the separatists dismissed.The escalation was framed politically through Yemen’s internationally recognised leadership. Rashad al-Alimi, head of the Presidential Leadership Council, cancelled a defence pact with the UAE and ordered Emirati forces to leave Yemen within 24 hours. In a televised speech, he accused Abu Dhabi of fuelling strife by backing the STC.“Unfortunately, it has been definitively confirmed that the United Arab Emirates pressured and directed the STC to undermine and rebel against the authority of the state through military escalation,” he said.Al-Alimi also imposed a temporary no-fly zone and a sea and ground blockade on ports and crossings, except for coalition-approved exemptions, signalling the seriousness of the moment.The escalation risks opening a new front in Yemen’s decade-long war, with anti-Houthi forces turning on each other while the Houthis remain entrenched in the north, including in Sanaa.More than ten years of conflict have already killed over 150,000 people and created one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. Strategic southern regions now at the centre of the dispute hold key ports and most of Yemen’s oil reserves.","Saudi Arabia and the UAE were once the twin pillars of the coalition formed in 2015 to restore Yemen’s internationally recognised government.

Happy New Year: Watch How World Welcomed 2026, From New York To Paris To Dubai To Auckland





US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump on Wednesday hosted their annual New Year’s Eve party at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, drawing high-profile guests from politics, business, and social circles. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu was also among the attendees.Netanyahu, who arrived at Trump’s Palm Beach residence on Monday, was spotted alongside a tuxedo-clad Trump in a social media post shared by conservative influencer Michael Solakiewicz. Trump and Netanyahu were seen watching the fireworks display together.According to AFP, Trump had joked earlier during their meetings that the Israeli leader might attend the party while discussing the fragile Gaza ceasefire and other regional geopolitical issues.The US President also briefly spoke to reporters outside the club’s ballroom. On being asked by the reporter about his 2026 resolution, he said “Peace, Peace on Earth”.The evening also featured a charity auction. Artist Vanessa Horabuena created a speed painting of Jesus, which Trump later auctioned for charity at the event. The painting ultimately sold for $2.75 million, with half of the proceeds going to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and the other half to the local sheriff’s department.“It’s going to St. Jude’s. It’s going to the sheriff’s office. We have two million seven fifty,” Trump said after the final bidding.According to the NY Post, the guest list was packed with Trump’s family and allies, including his sons Donald Jr. and Eric, daughter-in-law Lara Trump, longtime ally Rudy Giuliani, Emirati billionaire Hussain Sajwani, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Dan Scavino, U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro, Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), U.S. Ambassador to India Sergio Gor, and businessman Phil Ruffin.Inside the ballroom, Trump told guests, “We’re back. We’re strong. The country is doing great.” “We have a lot of leaders,” he added. The black-tie celebration featured dinner, music, and fireworks.Mar-a-Lago, often referred to as Trump’s “Winter White House,” was under heightened security for the festivities.","US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump hosted their annual New Year’s Eve party at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida.

President Donald Trump said he removed National Guard troops, for now, from Chicago, Los Angeles and Portland, Oregon, after legal roadblocks held up his push to deploy them in Democrat-led cities.Trump said in a social media post Wednesday that he was removing the Guard troops for now. “We will come back, perhaps in a much different and stronger form, when crime begins to soar again - Only a question of time!” he wrote.Troops had already left Los Angeles after the President deployed them earlier this year as part of a broader crackdown on crime and immigration.

The order was not a final ruling but was a significant and rare setback by the high court for the President’s efforts.In the nation’s capital, District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb sued to halt the deployments of more than 2,000 guardsmen.In Oregon, a federal judge permanently blocked the deployment of National Guard troops there.California National Guard troops had already been removed from the streets of Los Angeles by Dec. 15 after a court ruling. But an appeals court had paused a separate part of the order that required control of the Guard to return to Gov. Gavin Newsom.In a Tuesday court filing, the Trump administration said it was no longer seeking a pause in that part of the order. That paved the way for the California National Guard troops to fully return to state control after Trump federalised the Guard in June.","Trump said in a social media post Wednesday that he was removing the Guard troops for now. “We will come back, perhaps in a much different and stronger form, when crime begins to soar again - Only a question of time!” he wrote.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126278976,imgsize-84210,width-400,resizemode-4/donald-trump.jpg"

The Oklahoma Highway Patrol issued a warning after a trooper had to perform a maneuver to stop a sleeping driver's vehicle from crashing recently on the Will Rogers Turnpike in northeastern Oklahoma.Around 12:20 p.m. on December 13, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol received multiple calls about a newer-model Kia driving slowly in the right lane of the Will Rogers Turnpike. Callers reported that the driver appeared to be slumped over inside the car.Lt. Brian McSlarrow found the vehicle near the rest stop in Vinita, and the car was going 40 mph on the turnpike. Although the vehicle stayed in its lane, the driver was weaving back and forth inside the lane, KOCO News5 reported.McSlarrow confirmed that the driver was slumped over but couldn't determine whether he was fatigued or was experiencing a medical emergency, according to the Oklahoma Highway Patrol. The trooper activated his emergency lights and got his patrol car close to the Kia, but the driver did not respond.McSlarrow then performed a tactical vehicle intervention maneuver, causing the Kia to stop and the driver to wake up.The driver told troopers that he had worked nearly 20 hours within a 24-hour period. He had recently left work and stopped to eat before getting on the road with the Kia's lane assist feature activated.The car maintained a speed of around 40 mph, although troopers said they don't believe cruise control was set.""They are confident the lane assist system kept the vehicle within its lane while the driver slept,"" Oklahoma Highway Patrol officials said.Troopers issued the driver a citation, and his wife was called to take him home.""Driving while sleepy is extremely dangerous and can be just as dangerous, if not more so, than driving intoxicated,"" the Oklahoma Highway Patrol posted on social media.

US President Donald Trump ripped Colorado Governor Jared Polis and Mesa County District Attorney Dan Rubinstein and said that they should “rot in hell” over the incarceration of former election clerk Tina Peters.“God Bless Tina Peters, who is now, for two years out of nine, sitting in a Colorado Maximum Security Prison, at the age of 73, and sick, for the ‘crime’ of trying to stop the massive voter fraud that goes on in her State (where people are leaving in record numbers!),” Trump posted on Truth Social.Referring to Polis as “the Scumbag Governor,” the President added that he wishes “only the worst. May they rot in Hell. FREE TINA PETTERS!”Trump also attacked the Democratic Governor in a separate post, claiming Colorado and California were the “TOP OUTBOUND STATES IN 2025 (United Van Lines!) — In other words, PEOPLE LEAVING!!!”“That’s what bad governors do to even places blessed with beautiful surrounds and climate,” the second post reads.In a statement obtained by The Hill, Rubinstein said, “There’s a saying in the law: if the facts are on your side, pound the facts; if the law is on your side, pound the law; if neither is on your side, pound the table.”“President Trump has no facts and no law here,” Rubinstein continued. “After trying and failing to invent both, he’s left with nothing but pounding the table.”Last week, Peters asked for a Colorado appeals court to accept Trump’s presidential pardon freeing her, arguing that the appeals court no longer has jurisdiction over her case because of the pardon.Presidents do not have the power to overturn state convictions.At the time Trump announced her clemency, he mocked Polis and suggested the Governor “allowed his State to go to hell.”The administration also attempted to transfer Peters from state to federal custody, but the Colorado Department of Corrections denied the request.Peters was convicted on state charges tied to illegally tampering with voting machines in the 2020 election. She was later sentenced to nine years in prison.Trump has sought to help people convicted of crimes related to his claims that he did not lose the 2020 election, including those convicted or charged in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.His criticism of Polis over Peters comes after the President vetoed a bill to complete a project that would have delivered water to southeastern Colorado, one of the first vetoes of his second term. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) blasted the administration for vetoing “a completely non-controversial, bipartisan bill that passed both the House and Senate unanimously.”Boebert said in a post on social platform X that despite the veto, “This isn’t over.”The White House’s defence for the veto cited the project’s cost.“H.R. 131 would continue the failed policies of the past by forcing Federal taxpayers to bear even more of the massive costs of a local water project — a local water project that, as initially conceived, was supposed to be paid for by the localities using it,” the memo reads.","Tina Peters was convicted on state charges tied to illegally tampering with voting machines in the 2020 election.

'PEOPLE WILL DIE IN NYC': Huge Warning To Zohran MamdanI; Elon Revolts Over Mayor's First Big Move





As the clock strikes midnight on New Year’s Day, Zohran Mamdani will officially assume office as the mayor of New York City, marking the start of his term with two separate swearing-in ceremonies.The Democrat’s team has planned a private oath-taking with family at midnight, followed by a public ceremony in the afternoon outside City Hall.The first oath will be held at the former City Hall subway station in Manhattan, one of the city’s original subway stops known for its tiled arches and vaulted ceilings. It will be administered by New York Attorney General Letitia James, a political ally and notable foe of former President Donald Trump.Mamdani’s office said the choice of venue reflects his “commitment to the working people who keep our city running every day.”“When Old City Hall Station first opened in 1904 — one of New York’s 28 original subway stations — it was a physical monument to a city that dared to be both beautiful and build great things that would transform working peoples’ lives,” Mamdani said.“That ambition need not be a memory confined only to our past, nor must it be isolated only to the tunnels beneath City Hall: it will be the purpose of the administration fortunate enough to serve New Yorkers from the building above.”Later in the day, Mamdani will take a second oath on the steps of City Hall at 1 pm. The oath will be administered by US Senator Bernie Sanders , one of his political heroes, while US Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will deliver the opening remarks.The public swearing-in will be accompanied by a block party along Broadway leading up to City Hall, featuring performances, music and interfaith elements. Mamdani’s office expects thousands of people to attend.According to the mayor’s office, Mamdani’s inaugural committee includes actor John Turturro, playwright Cole Escola, writer Colson Whitehead, as well as advocates, small business owners and campaign workers who have “provided perspective, guidance, and cultural sensibility” for the ceremony.Holding two ceremonies follows a long-standing tradition for incoming New York City mayors. Outgoing Mayor Eric Adams held his initial oath at Times Square shortly after the famous ball drop, while his predecessor, Bill de Blasio, took his first oath at home in Brooklyn.The dual-ceremony format allows Mamdani to combine a personal, family-focused moment with a large public celebration to welcome the new administration.","Zohran Mamdani will officially assume office as the mayor of New York City on New Year's Day.

The old MAGA–Israel bargain

The new MAGA revolt

Media civil war on the right

Theology, rewritten

Trump’s strategic silence

Why this matters





For nearly half a century, support for Israel was the closest thing the American right had to a theological constant. It bound together evangelical Christians, Cold War hawks, neoconservatives, and Republican donors into a durable, almost unexamined consensus. Donald Trump’s first term appeared to mark its triumph: Jerusalem recognised as Israel’s capital, the Abraham Accords signed, and Benjamin Netanyahu embraced as a political soulmate.And yet, in Trump’s second term, that old certainty is cracking. Not because Trump himself has turned against Israel. He has not. The fracture exists because the movement built around him is no longer ideologically unified on the question. Israel has become the issue exposing MAGA’s internal fault lines: generational, theological, ideological, and in some cases, disturbingly antisemitic.To understand the rupture, it helps to recall how the alliance was formed. The modern Republican commitment to Israel was never just strategic. It was theological.From the late 1970s onwards, evangelical Christians, particularly those influenced by premillennial dispensationalism, came to see the modern state of Israel as part of a divine timetable. Israel’s survival and expansion were read as signs of biblical prophecy moving towards its final act.Supporting Israel was not merely good foreign policy. It was obedience.This belief system dovetailed neatly with Cold War geopolitics. Israel was framed as a democratic outpost against Soviet-backed Arab regimes. By the Reagan era, the alliance between the Christian Right, neoconservatives, and pro-Israel lobbying groups had hardened into Republican orthodoxy. Questioning Israel became politically radioactive inside the party.Trump inherited this structure and amplified it. He did not build the pro-Israel consensus. He weaponised it.What has changed is not Trump’s position, but MAGA’s composition.The Republican Party that emerged after 2016 absorbed voters who were younger, more online, more conspiratorial, and less tethered to Cold War or Holocaust-era moral frameworks. Many of them arrived through anti-establishment anger rather than religious conviction. For this cohort, “America First” does not automatically translate into reflexive support for Israel.Surveys and focus groups of younger Republicans now show a sharp divergence. Older GOP voters remain overwhelmingly pro-Israel. Newer MAGA-aligned voters are far more sceptical and sometimes openly hostile. Their objections often begin with foreign policy arguments. Why spend billions abroad when America faces inflation, immigration, and cultural decline at home?But the line between isolationism and antisemitism has increasingly blurred. Online MAGA spaces circulate conspiracies about Jewish power, Israel’s influence over Washington, and shadowy financial networks. What was once fringe white nationalist rhetoric is now bleeding into broader right-wing discourse.This ideological drift has spilled into an open media war.Figures like Tucker Carlson have emerged as the most influential critics of Israel on the mainstream right. Carlson has attacked Christian Zionism as a form of theological corruption, arguing that American Christians have been manipulated into sacrificing national interest for a foreign state. His critiques are framed as intellectual and nationalist, but they overlap uncomfortably with ideas long associated with the antisemitic right.At the harder edge of this ecosystem sits Nick Fuentes, whose explicitly antisemitic worldview dispenses with policy arguments altogether and instead treats Israel and Jews as civilisational enemies. Fuentes remains toxic to much of the Republican establishment, but his ideas circulate freely online and increasingly seep into broader MAGA discourse, often laundered through euphemism and irony.On the other side stand voices like Ben Shapiro, who defend Israel as both a moral ally and a strategic necessity. The clashes between these camps, sometimes literal and played out on conference stages, have turned Israel into a loyalty test inside conservative media.Activists such as Candace Owens have gone further, adopting language that portrays Israel in almost metaphysical terms of evil. What once would have ended a conservative career now circulates freely within parts of the MAGA ecosystem.Beneath the politics lies a quieter but more consequential shift. Theology.Younger conservative Christians are moving away from dispensationalist readings of the Bible that placed Israel at the centre of God’s plan. Some are gravitating towards postmillennial or Christian nationalist frameworks that see America, not Israel, as the chosen civilisational project. Others, including high-profile MAGA figures, have turned towards Catholicism, which does not share evangelical Zionism’s end-times obsession.The result is a worldview where Israel is no longer sacred, nor even particularly special. In some interpretations, Judaism itself is framed as incomplete or obsolete. This idea has a long and ugly history in Christian Europe. When this theology merges with nationalist grievance, the outcome is not merely scepticism of Israel, but hostility towards Jews as a group.Trump has watched this fracture with characteristic pragmatism. He continues to back Israel unequivocally, hosts Netanyahu, and defends Israeli military actions without hesitation. But he has shown little interest in disciplining anti-Israel or antisemitic elements within his broader coalition.His likely successor in MAGA politics, JD Vance, has been notably noncommittal, avoiding clear statements that might alienate either camp. This ambiguity is not accidental. MAGA is now a coalition held together less by ideology than by resentment, and Israel has become one of the issues where those resentments collide.The Israel split reveals something larger about MAGA’s future.For decades, Republican foreign policy was anchored by moral clarity. Sometimes simplistic, sometimes selective, but stable. That clarity is gone. In its place is a volatile mix of isolationism, online radicalisation, theological revisionism, and generational fatigue with inherited causes.Israel is not just another foreign policy debate inside MAGA. It is the test case for whether the movement becomes a disciplined nationalist project or drifts further into conspiratorial populism. It also raises a darker question. Who decides what, and who, is allowed inside the MAGA tent?Trump may still dominate the present. But the fight over Israel suggests that the post-Trump right will be far less predictable, far less coherent, and far more willing to tear up alliances once thought eternal.","For nearly half a century, support for Israel was the closest thing the American right had to a theological constant. But in Trump’s second term, that old certainty is cracking. The fracture exists because the movement built around him is no longer ideologically unified on the question.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126274165,imgsize-789719,width-400,resizemode-4/how-the-israel-issue-is-splintering-maga.jpg"
Body found near San Antonio home of missing Texas teen Camila Mendoza Olmos,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/body-found-near-san-antonio-home-of-missing-texas-teen-camila-mendoza-olmos/articleshow/126273852.cms,"



A body has been found near the San Antonio home of Camila Mendoza Olmos, the 19-year-old Texas teen who went missing shortly after leaving her house on the morning of Christmas Eve. Authorities said the discovery was made during a renewed search effort, but the body has not yet been formally identified, and no official cause of death has been determined.The Bexar County Sheriff's Office confirmed the discovery on Tuesday afternoon, December 30, after search teams returned to an area that had already been examined earlier in the investigation. The body was found in a field roughly 100 yards from Mendoza Olmos’ home, an area that was searched again due to concerns that tall grass may have obscured visibility during previous sweeps.Sheriff Javier Salazar said the body was located at approximately 4.45 pm local time and was wearing clothing that appeared “very similar” to what investigators believe Camila was wearing when she was last seen. While the proximity to her home and the clothing have raised concern, Salazar stressed that forensic identification is still pending.“We hope that we can expedite that process to try to get the community answers,” Salazar said during a briefing.According to the sheriff, investigators do not currently suspect foul play. He said there were indications of self-harm, but declined to provide specific details, citing the sensitivity of the case and the need to wait for confirmation from the medical examiner.A firearm was found near the body, Salazar confirmed. Investigators had previously been searching for a family member’s firearm that had been reported missing, and that aspect of the case remains under review as part of the ongoing investigation.The renewed search that led to the discovery involved combined teams from the sheriff’s office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Authorities said the area had been searched earlier in the investigation but was revisited after reassessing terrain conditions and visibility concerns.Mendoza Olmos was last seen on the morning of December 24, when a neighbour’s doorbell camera appeared to capture her standing next to her car just before 7 am, outside her home in San Antonio. She was reported missing later that day, prompting a multi-day search in and around her neighbourhood.Sheriff Salazar said Mendoza Olmos had been “going through a tough time” prior to her disappearance, though authorities have not publicly disclosed further details.Authorities say the next steps include formal identification of the body, an autopsy, and toxicology testing to determine the cause and manner of death. Officials have said additional information will be released once forensic work is complete and the family has been fully notified.For now, investigators are urging the public to allow time for the process to unfold, as the community awaits clarity in a case that has deeply affected the neighbourhood and drawn widespread attention across San Antonio and beyond.","Camila Mendoza Olmos, 19, went missing on December 24.

"Pakistan: Asim Munir marries third daughter to brother’s son; top military chiefs, politicians in attendance",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-asim-munir-marries-third-daughter-to-brothers-son-top-military-chiefs-politicians-in-attendance/articleshow/126263566.cms,"Mass Exodus Of Skilled Professionals In Pakistan: Report Exposes Asim Munir's 'Brain Gain' Claim





Pakistan army chief field marshal Asim Munir hosted his daughter’s wedding last week in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, where she was married to her first cousin, Abdul Rehman, according to Pakistani media reports.The ceremony was attended by senior political leaders and top military officials but was kept low-key due to security considerations, with no official photographs released.Among those present at the ceremony were Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari, prime minister Shehbaz Sharif, deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, Punjab chief minister Maryam Nawaz, the chief of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), and several serving and retired senior army officers, including former army chiefs.Pakistani journalist Zahid Gishkori said around 400 guests attended the event, which was deliberately kept subdued.Gishkori, in a video posted on social media platform YouTube, confirmed the family connection between the bride and groom. “Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir's daughter Mahnoor married his brother's son, ex-army captain turned civil servant Abdul Rehman Qasim,” he said.The groom, Abdul Rehman, is Munir’s nephew. According to local media, he previously served in the Pakistan Army as a captain before joining the civil administration through a quota reserved for army officers.He currently serves as an assistant commissioner.Munir has four daughters, and last week's ceremony marked the wedding of his third daughter.The wedding coincided with the arrival of UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Pakistan on the same day, prompting speculation on social media about a possible link between the two events. However, Ghiskori said that the UAE president did not attend the wedding.Pakistan’s security and foreign policy under Munir remains critical. A report by Greek City Times said that global patience with Pakistan’s trajectory toward “religious extremism” was wearing thin, alleging that the country had moved toward a more theocratic posture while failing to curb radical elements at home.Another report by Asian News Post criticised Islamabad’s military-led approach to regional diplomacy, particularly in relation to Afghanistan, stating that the strategy had failed to stabilise borders or improve Pakistan’s international standing.","Munir has four daughters, and last week's ceremony marked the wedding of his third daughter.
