'Will Give Advice To PM Modi On Dealing With Trump': Israel PM Netanyahu Amid Tariff Tensions

NEW DELHI: AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Friday hit out at Benjamin Netanyahu after the Israeli leader offered to “advise” Prime Minister Narendra Modi on ""handling"" Donald Trump over the US president's 50 per cent tariffs on India.“India is not so unfortunate that its Prime Minister has to take advice from a war criminal and genocidaire who has an outstanding ICC (International Criminal Court) warrant against him,” Owaisi posted on X, alleging Netanyahu was responsible for the “genocide” of 65,000 Palestinians, including 20,000 children, in Gaza.The Hyderabad MP claimed 1.2 million (12 lakh) people had been rendered homeless and over 2,000 UN employees killed in Gaza, despite Israel facing two adverse International Court of Justice rulings. “I hope PM Modi will stand on the right side of history and not become a passive participant,” he added.Owaisi has been a consistent critic of Israel’s Gaza offensive launched after the October 7, 2023, Hamas attacks.Netanyahu, while calling both PM Modi and Trump his “terrific” friends, had said he would share his ""advice"" with the prime minister ""privately.""""PM Modi and Trump are terrific friends of mine.

This denies citizens the right to vote against the said candidate by opting for 'NOTA', which is a facet of their fundamental right to expression under Article 19(1)(a) exercised through voting.The ministry said that the right to vote, which is a statutory right and not a fundamental right, arises only in a situation where a poll involving two or more candidates in a constituency is held.

J&K: Omar government slams LG over book ban,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jk-omar-government-slams-lg-over-book-ban/articleshow/123195005.cms,"SRINAGAR: J&K’s governing National Conference (NC) on Friday decried banning books as “unfortunate and deeply ill-conceived”, days after LG Manoj Sinha-led home department banned 25 titles, including some by Booker-prize winning author Arundhati Roy and constitutionalist AG Noorani.The NC statement came with a reassurance that it was trying to see how the ban could be revoked under the Union Territory’s (UT) system of governance where the LG oversees such matters. Global rights organisation Amnesty also questioned the move. The home department has described the action as part of an ongoing crackdown on publications allegedly promoting secessionist ideologies, glorifying terrorism, or disseminating distorted historical narratives.Chief minister Omar Abdullah responded to accusations that he had ordered the ban. “Get your facts right before you call me a coward, you ignoramus. The ban has been imposed by the LG using the only department he officially controls - the Home Department. I’ve never banned books & I never would,” Omar posted on X, responding to the allegations.Following Tuesday’s order under section 98 of Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) 2023, police had on Thursday seized allegedly “subversive” books from stores and literary venues, including Chinar book festival on the banks of Dal Lake.NC spokesman Tanvir Sadiq asked “why we are so afraid of differing opinions”. “History shows that banning books only fuels curiosity, people want to know why something is banned, and readership often increases as a result. Silencing or intimidating opinions never worked and it won’t work now,” Sadiq said.Amnesty India stressed that of the 25 banned books, including Roy’s Azadi, many were written by respected journalists, historians, feminists, and peace scholars, and these weren’t “terror manuals” but “critical voices”. “Censoring books on the basis of an executive notification without due process and judicial oversight doesn’t bring peace; it silences dissent. When govts fear ideas, it tells you more about the state than the speech,” Amnesty said in a statement.Thursday’s seizures included copies of A Dismantled State: The Untold Story of Kashmir After Article 370 by Anuradha Bhasin, The Kashmir Dispute, 1947–2012 by Noorani, and Kashmir at the Crossroads by Sumantra Bose.","J&K’s governing National Conference decries banning books as “unfortunate and deeply ill-conceived” LG Manoj Sinha-led home department banned 25 titles, including some by Booker-prize winning author Arundhati Roy and constitutionalist AG Noorani.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123195002,imgsize-1334134,width-400,resizemode-4/123195002.jpg"

Update threat assessments to spot and handle risks early.



Have armed police or guards in all team and league offices whenever players or staff are present.



Add weapons screening at entrances to these buildings, similar to security checks at stadiums.

Shane Tamura’s actions and the victims

The National Football League has told all 32 of its teams to make security tighter after a deadly shooting at the league’s New York City headquarters on Monday, July 28, 2025. The attack happened inside 345 Park Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, a building that houses both NFL offices and Blackstone headquarters. Police said Shane Tamura, 27, from Las Vegas, entered the lobby with an M4 assault rifle, shot several people, then went to the 33rd floor before killing himself. Four people died, and one NFL employee was seriously hurt. On Friday, August 8, 2025, the NFL sent a memo urging teams to act fast, saying safety was now their top priority.The memo, sent by the NFL’s chief security officer and general counsel, listed three new measures:The memo stated, “There is no higher priority than the safety and the sense of security of our players, coaches, staff, and everyone who works in and around our facilities.” It also admitted these changes would require time, coordination, and resources, but said safety “is foundational” and cannot be treated as an afterthought.Investigators said Shane Tamura first opened fire in the lobby around 5:20 p.m., killing Officer Didarul Islam, 36, an off-duty NYPD officer working security. He also killed Wesley LePatner, 43, a Blackstone executive and mother of two; Julia Hyman, 27, who worked for a real estate company; and security guard Aland Etienne.Also Read: Bill Belichick’s Girlfriend Jordon Hudson Makes Jaw Dropping Taylor Swift Tree Paine Comparison In Podcast One NFL staff member was wounded and taken to hospital in critical condition but has since stabilized.Police shared that Tamura allowed one woman to walk away unharmed before taking the elevator to the 33rd floor, where he shot another victim before taking his own life.In a note found later, Shane Tamura claimed he might have chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a brain disease linked to repeated head impacts.

'It wasn’t a fair fight at all': Police release body camera footage from Cincinnati bar brawl that left six injured,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/it-wasnt-a-fair-fight-at-all-police-release-body-camera-footage-from-cincinnati-bar-brawl-that-left-six-injured-see-video/articleshow/123199986.cms,"



In the Cincinnati viral beating case, police have now released new body camera footage from the scene that led to the arrest of six people and had also injured six people.The footage captures officers arriving at the scene at approximately 3.25 am on Saturday, July 26. According to a report by Fox News Digital, a single 911 call prompted law enforcement to respond, New York Post reported.In the video, a man wearing a polo green shirt, aged 62, told Cincinnati Police Department officer, “I’m 62 years old. I was attacked. I got attacked by multiple people.” When the officer inquires, “What led up to the fight?”, the man responds, “Don’t really know,” and adds, “It just got out of the bar and it just got crazy.”He further clarified, “Okay, you didn’t get into it with anybody inside the bar?” to which he replies, “No, no, no. Not at all. I got side-punched. It wasn’t a fair fight at all.”Another body camera video, also obtained by Fox News Digital, features a female officer asking witnesses if the “argument was about wings.” The footage shows a group purchasing and disputing wings at a local food truck in the early hours of Saturday, July 26.A witness said, “I heard it was the one white guy who called the guy a n—–.”The incident led to the indictment of six individuals by a grand jury on the same day the body camera footage was released. The Hamilton County Prosecutor’s Office confirmed charges against Patrick Rosemond, aged 38; Jermaine Matthews, 39; Montianez Merriweather, 34; DeKyra Vernon, 24; Dominique Kittle, 37; and Aisha Devaughn, 25. Each is facing three counts of alleged felonious assault, three charges of assault, and two charges of aggravated rioting.Hamilton County Prosecutor Connie Pillich stated, “What I saw on video is not the Cincinnati I know and love. These charges hold those involved in the attack accountable.” The release comes nearly two weeks after a bystander video of the brutal beating at the corner of Fourth and Elm streets went viral, causing national outrage.Witness Jay Black described the events, saying, “I saw a little ruckus going on, saw people kind of scuffling, so kind of zoomed in, and once my phone kind of focused in, I saw the so-called victims being pretty aggressive toward the group of people that were already standing out there.”Black added that the individual involved continued to fight using racial slurs despite others attempting to intervene. The incident has sparked criticism over the apparent lack of police presence in the downtown area, with only eleven officers stationed there on the night of the brawl.In a press conference last week, Cincinnati Police Chief Theresa Theetge expressed disappointment, stating, “That is unacceptable to not call the police. Traffic was horrendous. People saw this. They were fighting in front of traffic. Why didn’t people call us?” One of the victims, Holly, was seen in additional footage being violently slammed to the ground while attempting to separate the fighters.She recounted her experience to Fox News Digital, saying, “I remember being afraid, terrified. I just remember my life flashing before my eyes, and all I can think is, ‘Dear God, I hope my children know that I love them.’” Holly revealed that the attack left her with brain damage and severe concussion, resulting in life-altering injuries. “I’m having someone help take care of me financially, mentally and physically,” she added.Cincinnati Mayor Aftab Pureval addressed the violence during a press conference last week, said, “This was an awful incident, and our law enforcement has been working quickly and effectively to bring all responsible to justice. Let me be clear, there is no place for violent crime in Cincinnati, whether it’s a fight or gun violence. We will pursue those responsible and we will hold them accountable no matter who they are. ”","Police have released new body camera footage from the Cincinnati viral beating case that led to the arrest of six people.

Internal rift over reform

White House response





US President is planning something big for marijuana, as Trump recently raised the topic, saying that he needs to ""look at that."" Over dinner at his private Bedminster club, Trump reflected on his political moves, from ousting the nation's top economic statistician to weighing in on New York City politics. Then, the conversation turned to a subject still clouded in political uncertainty: federal marijuana restrictions.""We need to look at that,"" Trump told a small circle of donors, two attendees said, according to a report from CNN. ""That's something we're going to look at.""Nearly a year ago, Trump floated the idea of a sweeping shift in US marijuana policy, promising to make it easier for adults to access regulated products and grant states greater autonomy to legalise cannabis. He signalled support for removing marijuana from the same federal drug classification as heroin — a move that distinguished him from many Republican predecessors and aimed to appeal to younger voters, minority communities, and libertarian-leaning conservatives.Seven months into his second term, however, the pledge remains untouched, a conspicuous gap in the record of a president otherwise eager to notch campaign wins quickly.According to sources familiar with internal discussions, Trump's senior political strategists have been pushing for swift action, framing cannabis reform as a potential boost to Republican momentum heading into the midterms.Yet some policy advisers are urging caution, warning that easing restrictions could trigger legal complications, stir moral backlash, and potentially alienate parts of the conservative base.In a statement to CNN, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said the administration was taking a careful approach.""When it comes to marijuana, all policy and legal requirements and implications are being considered,"" she said. ""The only interest guiding the president's policy decision is what is in the best interest of the American people.""For now, Trump's Bedminster remark offers no clear timeline — only a reminder that the politics of marijuana remain as hazy as the policy itself.","US President Donald Trump says he needs to ""look at"" federal marijuana restrictions.

When and where will the leaders meet?



Why are Trump, Putin meeting in Alaska?



Will Zelenskyy be involved?



When were the past meetings?







US President Donald Trump is set to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday, August 15, in a bid to broker a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine. The conflict began with Russia’s invasion in February 2022 and has defied multiple rounds of talks.Announcing the meeting on Truth Social, Trump called it ""highly anticipated"" and promised more details soon.""The highly anticipated meeting between myself, as President of the United States of America, and President Vladimir Putin of Russia will take place next Friday, August 15, 2025, in the Great State of Alaska. Further details to follow. Thank you for your attention to this matter!"" Trump posted.The announcement came just hours after Trump told reporters he planned to discuss the ongoing war in Ukraine with Putin.The talks will mark Putin’s first visit to the United States in a decade, his last trip was in 2015 for the UN General Assembly in New York.Speaking at the White House on Friday, Trump said he believes that he has ""a shot"" at securing peace and hinted at possible ""swapping of territories"" between Ukraine and Russia, though he offered no specifics.""They would like to meet with me, I'll do whatever I can to stop the killing,"" Trump had earlier said on Thursday, referring to both Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy Trump told reporters that he believes Putin is open to ending the conflict, saying, ""President Putin, I believe, wants to see peace.""The meeting follows a visit to Moscow by Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, who proposed a three-way summit with Zelenskyy. However, Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov confirmed Russia “completely” ignored that option.The Kremlin confirmed the Alaska summit, calling it a “logical” next step in ongoing efforts to end the war.This meeting will be Trump’s most direct attempt yet to fulfill his campaign promise of ending the war “within 24 hours,” a pledge that has so far faced repeated setbacks despite phone calls, peace talks, and diplomatic visits.The summit will be held in Alaska, a symbolic location Russia sold to the US in 1867. Alaska’s western tip lies just across the Bering Strait from Russia’s easternmost point.Ushakov said the region is where US and Russian ""economic interests intersect"" and offers ""prospects for large-scale, mutually beneficial projects.""""Alaska and the Arctic are also where our countries' economic interests intersect, and there are prospects for large-scale, mutually beneficial projects,"" Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said in a statement on Telegram.""But, of course, the presidents themselves will undoubtedly focus on discussing options for achieving a long-term peaceful settlement of the Ukrainian crisis,"" he added.While the main agenda will be Ukraine, Ushakov noted that Russia has invited Trump to hold the next meeting on Russian soil. ""A corresponding invitation has already been sent to the US president,"" he noted.An International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant for Putin, which requires member states to detain him if he enters their territory, was widely expected to limit potential venues for the meeting.Putin had earlier floated the United Arab Emirates as a possible host, while media reports speculated that Turkey, China, or India might serve as alternatives.Zelenskyy has repeatedly pushed for a three-way summit, calling direct talks with Putin ""the only way to make progress toward peace.""Russia has ruled this out for now, saying a Putin-Zelenskyy meeting could only happen in the ""final phase"" of negotiations once terms are agreed.Asked if meeting Zelenskyy was a prerequisite, Trump replied: ""No, he doesn’t.""Trump and Putin last met in person in 2019 at the G20 summit in Japan, and previously held a high-profile summit in Helsinki in 2018.Biden last met Putin in Geneva in June 2021, a summit US officials later described as a ""focused, and practical"" exchange between the two leaders.Despite the flurry of diplomacy, Moscow and Kyiv remain far apart. In June talks, Russia reiterated its demands: Ukraine must withdraw from the four regions Moscow claims to have annexed, declare neutrality, refuse Western military support, and permanently rule out Nato membership.Kyiv, meanwhile, is calling for an immediate ceasefire and insists it will never recognise Russian control over its sovereign territory.","US President Donald Trump will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on August 15.

Cambodia backs Trump for peace prize





Armenian prime minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani president Ilham Aliyev on Saturday jointly threw their weight behind US president Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, following a landmark peace agreement between the two longtime rivals of the South Caucasus.Speaking at a White House signing event Friday, both leaders credited Trump’s mediation for ending decades of conflict and called on the Nobel committee to recognise his efforts.Aliyev asked, “Who, if not President Trump, deserves a Nobel Peace Prize?” while Pashinyan described Trump as the “peacemaker” behind the “breakthrough” and said the US president “deserved the Nobel.”The agreement commits Armenia and Azerbaijan to “stop all fighting forever, open up commerce, travel and diplomatic relations and respect each other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Trump announced.The two leaders shook hands under Trump’s watchful gaze before signing a joint declaration that the White House described as historic.Aliyev hailed the “historic signature” between “countries which were at war for more than three decades,” and said, “We are today establishing peace in the Caucasuses.”The deal includes the creation of a transit corridor through Armenia connecting Azerbaijan to its Nakhchivan exclave.The United States will hold development rights for this strategically important route, dubbed the “Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity” (TRIPP).Trump expressed confidence that the two nations “would have a great relationship,” adding, “But if there’s conflict… they’re going to call me and we’re going to get it straightened out.”Christian-majority Armenia and Muslim-majority Azerbaijan have fought two wars over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region, which Azerbaijan recaptured in a 2023 offensive that triggered the exodus of more than 100,000 ethnic Armenians.Pashinyan said the peace deal “will pave the way to end decades of conflict between our countries and open a new era,” crediting Trump’s role as indispensable.A White House official described the US as “an enormous strategic commercial partner” for Armenia and said the agreement was a setback for China, Russia, and Iran.While some details of the deal remain unclear, the joint backing of Trump by both leaders for the Nobel Peace Prize marks a rare moment of international consensus centred on the US president’s role.Trump, who has sought the prize before, has previously highlighted his involvement in other peace efforts, including Cambodia-Thailand and India-Pakistan, but the Armenia-Azerbaijan breakthrough may be his most significant diplomatic achievement to date.However, Trump's repeated factless claim of brokering peace between India and Pakistan has been rejected by the government, with PM Modi saying in the Lok Sabha that no world leader asked India to stop its Operation Sindoor against Pakistan.Pakistan nominated US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize, crediting his ""decisive diplomatic intervention and pivotal leadership"" during the conflict between New Delhi and Islamabad.The announcement was made in a post on social media platform X, where Pakistani officials said Trump played a key role in defusing tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, noting his efforts in ""forging peace in one region after another"".""I want to present to you, Mr President, the letter I sent to the Nobel Prize Committee. It's nominating you for the Peace Prize, which is well deserved, and you should get it,"" Netanyahu said as Trump hosted him for talks at the White House.Cambodia’s prime minister Hun Manet announced on Thursday that he has nominated US President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, praising his “extraordinary statesmanship” in resolving a border conflict between Cambodia and Thailand.In a Facebook post, Hun Manet shared a letter sent to the Norwegian Nobel Committee, describing Trump’s intervention as an example of his “exceptional achievements in de-escalating tensions in some of the world’s most volatile regions.”",Armenian prime minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani president Ilham Aliyev on Saturday jointly threw their weight behind US president Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.

Four workers trapped in a collapsed copper mine in Central Chile, following a 4.3 magnitude earthquake in the area, were found dead, while one of the workers still remains missing, officials confirmed Sunday.The incident occurred on Thursday at El Teniente, one of the world’s largest copper mines, operated by Chile’s state-run mining company, Codelco. Operations at El Teniente have been suspended since the collapse.Codelco confirmed that the body of Gonzalo Nunez Caroca, one of the workers, was recovered on Saturday, while the three miners found on Sunday have not yet been identified.One worker was confirmed dead on the day of the incident, leaving five others trapped underground. Nine additional workers were injured.Codelco CEO Ruben Alvarado emphasised on Friday that the first 48 hours were crucial for rescue operations. He said that workers needed to clear 20 meters of debris to reach the area where the trapped miners were believed to be located.Chile President Gabriel Boric said Friday that his government would do “everything in (its) power” to find the missing workers. He also dispatched mining minister Aurora Williams to the site to coordinate rescue efforts, reported CNN.At a press conference on Saturday, Boric offered condolences to the family of Paulo Marín Tapia, another confirmed victim, and said he was in contact with the families of those still missing.Mine general manager Andres Music offered condolences in a Saturday statement. “We know that this news hits hard for the families of our colleagues and for our entire mining community,” he said.Both Codelco and the Chilean prosecutor’s office have opened investigations into the cause of the collapse. Music stressed that the incident was not caused by explosives. “We are making every effort to rescue these workers,” he said as quoted by CNN.","The incident occurred on Thursday at El Teniente, one of the world’s largest copper mines.

Israel's 'Secret' Syria Raid: IDF Paratroopers Storm 4 Sites In South Syria As Sweida Truce Frays





Federal officials have launched an investigation into former special counsel Jack Smith after US President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers accused him of engaging in illegal political activity during his investigations into Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign.The US office of special counsel (OSC), an independent federal agency, confirmed to NBC News on Saturday that it is looking into Smith for possible violations of the Hatch Act- a law that bars certain political activities by federal employees.The OSC is distinct from the justice department’s special counsel’s office, which Smith led during his investigation into Trump.While the OSC cannot bring criminal charges, it can recommend disciplinary action such as removal from the federal workforce. It may also refer findings to the Department of Justice, although that is uncommon.Senator Tom Cotton, R-Ark., formally requested the investigation on Wednesday, accusing Smith of “unprecedented interference in the 2024 election.”Smith was appointed special counsel by then-attorney general Merrick Garland in November 2022, just three days after Trump announced his presidential bid. He later brought two criminal indictments against Trump in 2023 but stepped down from the role slightly more than a week before Trump’s inauguration in January 2024.Neither case reached trial.“Jack Smith’s legal actions were nothing more than a tool for the Biden and Harris campaigns,” Cotton said in a post on X Wednesday. “This isn’t just unethical, it is very likely illegal campaign activity from a public office.”Cotton also claimed Smith pushed for a “rushed trial” of Trump, though he has not released specific evidence of illegal conduct.Hatch Act violations are rarely referred to the DOJ. In 2019, the OSC recommended then-President Trump remove White House counselor Kellyanne Conway for Hatch Act violations, but the issue did not lead to prosecution.Meanwhile, Trump’s nominee to lead the OSC, Paul Ingrassia, remains stalled in the senate. A White House official said that Ingrassia, a former podcast host with a history of controversial remarks, is currently holding one-on-one meetings with senators as part of the confirmation process.","Federal officials have launched an investigation into former special counsel Jack Smith.

Trump Rages At Schumer As Senate Talks Collapse, Nominations And Budget Face Gridlock





US President Trump launched a scathing attack on senate minority leader Chuck Schumer on Saturday, telling him to “GO TO HELL” after the Senate left Washington for its August recess without confirming over 130 of his executive branch nominees.A deal between Republicans and Democrats collapsed, and many key appointments remain stalled. Trump had urged the Senate to stay in session, but negotiations failed— leaving dozens of political appointees in limbo and the president fuming.“Senator Cryin’ Chuck Schumer is demanding over One Billion Dollars in order to approve a small number of our highly qualified nominees, who should right now be helping to run our Country,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.Trump was reacting to what he described as an unreasonable demand by Senate Democrats, accusing Schumer of tying nominee approvals to a $1 billion funding request, reported The New York Post.“This demand is egregious and unprecedented, and would be embarrassing to the Republican Party if it were accepted. It is political extortion, by any other name. Tell Schumer, who is under tremendous political pressure from within his own party, the Radical Left Lunatics, to GO TO HELL!” he addedTrump followed up with urging Republicans to hold firm and use the recess to rally public support, rather than accepting a compromise with Democrats.“Do not accept the offer, go home and explain to your constituents what bad people the Democrats are, and what a great job the Republicans are doing, and have done, for our Country. Have a great RECESS and, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!”Senate majority leader John Thune acknowledged the failed negotiations and the multiple attempts to reach an agreement with Schumer before recess. “There were several different times where I think either or both sides maybe thought there was a deal in the end.”Thune had been working with Schumer on a proposal to bundle nominee votes into two rounds—one before the recess and another afterward. But Democrats were reportedly seeking guarantees from Trump to restore funding for foreign aid and the National Institutes of Health, which the administration had frozen.The breakdown led to frustration on both sides, and senators were eager to begin their August break.Schumer, under pressure from his party’s progressive base, later celebrated the failure of the confirmation deal.“Let me clear what happened: Donald Trump attempted to steamroll the Senate to put in place his historically unqualified nominees. But Senate Democrats wouldn’t let him,” he said in a post on X Sunday.“Donald Trump’s style: Posture[,] Cajole[,] Stamp your feet… and then give up,” he added in a follow up post.With the deal dead, some Republicans suggested changing Senate rules to prevent Democrats from blocking confirmations. However, moderate GOP senators were reluctant, fearing the same rules could be used against them in the future.Thune allowed the Senate to continue holding pro forma sessions, ceremonial meetings that block Trump from making recess appointments, ensuring his nominees cannot be confirmed without Senate votes. Although the Senate passed three of twelve required appropriations bills, several key funding bills remain stuck in committee.According to senate appropriations chair Susan Collins, it marks the first time since 2018 that any funding bills were passed before the August recess. If the remaining bills aren’t approved by October 1, the government faces a partial shutdown, The New York Post reported.","US President Donald Trump launched a scathing attack on senate minority leader Chuck Schumer.

South Korea's impeached former president Yoon Suk Yeol lay on the floor of his prison cell wearing only an undershirt and boxer shorts to resist questioning, prosecutors said Friday, after a fresh attempt to bring him in for interrogation over election tampering allegations failed.Although already in custody on charges related to his attempt to impose martial law in December, prosecutors were required to serve a new warrant to question him in a separate case involving his wife, Kim Keon-hee.Assistant special prosecutor Oh Jeong-hee said a team of special prosecutors attempted to execute the warrant but were forced to abandon the effort after Yoon refused to cooperate.“The special prosecutors urged him to voluntarily comply with the arrest warrant, taking into account his status as a former president,” Oh said as quoted by South China Morning Post. “But the suspect persistently refused, remaining on the floor and declining to put on his prison uniform.”Prosecutors repeated the request four times over 20- to 30-minute intervals before halting the operation after two hours, citing concerns that using physical force might lead to harm.“During the process, the suspect was informed that the next attempt to execute the warrant would proceed even with the use of physical force,” Oh added.She noted that Yoon had long championed “rule of law, fairness, and common sense,” adding, “The public is closely watching whether the law is applied equally to all. We hope the suspect, who once served as a prosecutor, prosecutor general and president, will respect and comply with legal procedures.”Jhee Byong-kuen, a political science professor at Chosun University, criticised Yoon’s actions. “No criminal defies the rule of law in such a disgraceful way,” he said, as cited by South China Morning Post. “The former leader is showing no remorse and portraying himself as a victim of political persecution.”Yoon was first arrested on January 15 by the corruption investigation office for high-ranking officials on charges of insurrection and abuse of power. He was released after 52 days due to procedural issues, but rearrested on July 10 on new charges, including obstruction of official duties. Since then, he has refused to leave his cell for questioning. Prosecutors later added charges, alleging he instructed his security team to interfere with his earlier arrest.He is also resisting a separate probe into alleged election meddling involving his wife. The couple is accused of influencing People Power Party nominations for local and National Assembly elections.In April, the Constitutional Court upheld Yoon’s impeachment, originally passed by the National Assembly in response to the martial law attempt.","South Korea's impeached former president Yoon Suk Yeol lay on the floor of his prison cell wearing only an undershirt and boxer shorts to resist questioning, prosecutors said.

Trump-Harvard row







Harvard University is facing backlash after a congressional probe revealed years-long partnerships with organisations tied to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).The revelation sparked concerns over foreign influence and national security risks.According to documents obtained by the Washington Free Beacon, the Ivy League institution allegedly collaborated with CCP-controlled entities for over a decade.The foreign bodies included the Central Organisation Department, the powerful organ responsible for training and selecting China’s top officials.A general focus of the investigation is the Harvard Kennedy School’s partnership with the Chinese Executive Leadership Academy Pudong, a government-run training school.Whistleblowers have claimed that Chinese government and party officials were sent to Harvard as part of their official education, prompting bipartisan alarm.“Harvard’s formal partnership with a CCP-controlled school to train their future leaders raises serious concerns about the CCP’s influence in American institutions,” said representative John Moolenaar.“We are committed to uncovering the full extent of these relationships to ensure transparency and protect national interests,"" he added.Furthermore, representatives Tim Walberg and Elise Stefanik co-signed a letter accusing Harvard of working directly with groups formed by CCP ideology, particularly ""Xi Jinping Thought"".The scandal adds to mounting pressure on the university, which is reportedly considering $500 million payout to settle disputes with US President Donald Trump and his administration over alleged campus anti-Semitism and its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies.In April, the Free Beacon also reported that Harvard had trained members of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, a paramilitary group sanctioned by the US for its involvement in the repression of Uyghur Muslims.Congress has given Harvard until August 7 to turn over all records tied to its dealings with CCP-linked bodies, including financial or material exchanges.Harvard University and the Trump administration have been at odds since the MAGA chief assumed office in January.In April 2025, the administration froze approximately $2.2–2.6 billion in federal research funding and revoked Harvard’s certification to host international students, citing alleged failures to tackle antisemitic harassment and ideological bias. In response, Harvard filed lawsuits claiming federal overreach and threats to academic freedom.Earlier this week, reports surfaced that the White House had proposed a settlement of up to $500 million, but Harvard President Alan Garber denied any imminent agreement, calling the figure false and leaked by administration sources. He emphasised that any deal must not compromise the university’s freedom to govern academic affairs independently.The battle has drawn intense scrutiny from faculty, students, alumni, and congressional Democrats.On Friday, fourteen Democratic legislators—many of them Harvard alumni—warned that any settlement under political pressure could prompt a congressional investigation, arguing that yielding to the White House risks setting a dangerous precedent for institutional autonomy across US higher education.Meanwhile, faculty groups have continued to mobilise, demanding red lines on issues such as external monitoring, data-sharing, and control over admissions and hiring.","Harvard University is facing backlash after a congressional probe revealed years-long partnerships with organisations tied to the Chinese Communist Party.

The US Senate on Saturday confirmed Jeanine Pirro, a well-known Fox News personality and President Donald Trump loyalist, to a high-profile federal prosecutor role in Washington, DC.With a vote count of 50-45, Pirro secured confirmation as the US Attorney for the District of Columbia. Trump encouraged the Republican-controlled Senate to process his nominations during weekend sessions, following his return to the White House six months prior.Trump provisionally appointed Pirro to the role in May, continuing his pattern of selecting hosts from the conservative television network and steadfast supporters for influential governmental positions.Trump previously praised the outspoken 74-year-old former Westchester County district attorney when he nominated her, as being ""in a class by herself.""Jeanine Pirro is a former judge, prosecutor, and prominent conservative television personality, best known for her outspoken commentary on Fox News.Before rising to national media fame, Pirro built a lengthy legal career in New York. She served as the district attorney of Westchester County from 1994 to 2005, becoming the first woman to hold that position.During her tenure, she established the nation’s first domestic violence prosecution unit, according to the US Justice Department.Earlier in her career, she also served as a county judge.Pirro transitioned to television in the 2000s, hosting shows like Judge Jeanine Pirro (2008–2011) and Justice with Judge Jeanine on Fox News, which ran for over a decade.She later became a co-host on Fox’s popular roundtable show The Five. Her on-air segments often included inflammatory rhetoric and conspiracy theories—particularly surrounding the 2020 election—which at times led to temporary removals from the network lineup.She joins a growing list of cable news figures with political roles, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, both of whom had careers at Fox.Pirro is also a published author. Her 2018 book, Liars, Leakers, and Liberals: The Case Against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy, was described by The Washington Post as overly loyal to Donald Trump.Her personal life has not been without controversy. Her ex-husband, Albert Pirro, was convicted of tax evasion during her time as district attorney and later received a pardon from Trump during his presidency.Earlier, the Senate Judiciary Committee's leading Democrat, Dick Durbin, opposed Pirro's permanent appointment as US Attorney, describing her selection as a ""rubber stamp for Donald Trump.""Durbin referenced her role in spreading conspiracy theories about the 2020 election, which Trump lost to Biden, AP reported.Pirro was sued by Dominion Voting Systems after she promoted false claims of election fraud on Fox News. The company accused Fox of airing defamatory statements about its role in the vote count. Fox later settled the lawsuit for around $800 million.","The US Senate confirmed Jeanine Pirro, 74, to a high-profile federal prosecutor role in Washington, DC.

US Police continued scouring the rugged mountains of Montana on Saturday as the search for Michael Paul Brown, a 45-year-old military veteran accused of fatally shooting four people at The Owl Bar in Anaconda, entered its second day.Brown fled the scene in a white pickup truck, which was later abandoned, according to Lee Johnson of the Montana Division of Criminal Investigation. Johnson urged residents Friday night to stay indoors and remain alert.Authorities also released a photo of Brown, reportedly taken as he fled. In the image, he appears gaunt, barefoot, and dressed only in black shorts while walking down a set of outdoor concrete steps.""While law enforcement has not received reports of Brown harming any other individuals, he is believed to be armed, and he is extremely dangerous,"" Johnson said, the Associated Press reported.Brown's military service included Army deployment to Iraq (2004-2005) and Montana National Guard service until March 2009, reaching sergeant rank.His niece, Clare Boyle, indicated Brown's ongoing mental health challenges: ""This isn't just a drunk/high man going wild,"" she said via Facebook.""It's a sick man who doesn't know who he is sometimes and frequently doesn't know where or when he is either,"" Boyle added.The search concentrated near Stumptown Road, west of Anaconda, involving multiple agencies at ground level and in the air. Local businesses were permitted to operate, though Chief Bill Sather advised vigilance.Victim identifications await family notifications.The bar owner, David Gwerder, confirmed Brown lived adjacent to the establishment. The victims included the bartender and three customers.""He knew everybody that was in that bar. I guarantee you that,"" Gwerder told AP. ""He didn't have any running dispute with any of them.

‘Trump Angry As India Denies Nobel Push, Rejects' Mediation In Operation Sindoor Ceasefire | WATCH





In a symbolic assertion of strategic alignment, Pakistan’s military hosted on Friday a grand ceremony at General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi to mark the 98th anniversary of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA), showcasing its deepening defence partnership with Beijing.The event came soon after a surprise 19% tariff on Pakistani imports announced by US President Donald Trump just days after Washington and Islamabad concluded new trade deals.While the tariff decision is believed to have been discussed between the two sides as part of broader trade negotiations, Trump’s typically blunt commentary on social media appeared aimed more at India than Pakistan. In recent days, Trump has taken jabs at New Delhi over its continued purchase of Russian oil and defence equipment, while casting Pakistan in a more favourable light.At GHQ, however, Pakistan’s military made its strategic loyalties unambiguous. Army Chief Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir hosted Chinese ambassador Jiang Zaidong and PLA defence attaché Maj Gen Wang Zhong at a ceremony that included military tributes, visuals of joint defence hardware, and strong political messaging. Munir described the Pakistan-China relationship as a “beacon of mutual trust and shared destiny” and referred to the PLA and Pakistan Army as “iron brothers”.The messaging was clear: Pakistan is reaffirming its long-standing alignment with China even as it navigates transactional ties with Washington and economic turbulence at home. With IMF conditionalities tightening and Western funding streams growing unpredictable, Islamabad continues to anchor itself in Beijing’s strategic orbit, particularly through projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).For China, the event was a diplomatic win. As Beijing faces intensifying rivalry with the US across the Indo-Pacific, its deepening influence over a nuclear-armed ally in South Asia reinforces its foothold in the region. The GHQ ceremony was a visual and political endorsement of China’s role as Islamabad’s primary defence and development partner.With Pakistan and China enhancing defence cooperation and projecting unity, New Delhi faces a more tightly aligned northern bloc just as it expands its own security ties with the US and with Indo-Pacific allies.Despite the potential economic fallout of the US tariffs, Rawalpindi appears undeterred. In an era of fluid alliances, Pakistan is betting on consistency with Beijing over the unpredictability of Western partners, a gamble that could reshape the regional balance in the years ahead.",Pakistan's military hosted a grand ceremony to mark the 98th anniversary of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) The event came soon after a surprise 19% tariff on Pakistani imports announced by US President Donald Trump.

A Pakistani anti-terrorism court on Thursday sentenced more than 100 members of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan 's party to prison terms on charges related to riots that targeted military sites in 2023, a court order said.Fifty-eight of the defendants, who included parliamentarians and senior officials, were sentenced to 10 years in prison and the rest were given sentences ranging from one to three years, the court said.The accused include Omar Ayub Khan and Shibli Faraz, the leaders of Khan's opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party (PTI) in the lower and upper houses of parliament respectively, the court order seen by Reuters read.""The prosecution has proved its case against the accused without a shadow of doubt,"" it said in announcing the sentences.Khan, who has been in prison since 2023 facing charges of corruption, land fraud and disclosure of official secrets, is being tried separately on similar charges related to the riot.The government accuses him and other leaders of inciting the May 9, 2023, protests, during which demonstrators attacked military and government buildings, including the army headquarters in Rawalpindi.He denies wrongdoing and says all the cases are politically motivated as part of a military-backed crackdown to dismantle his party.

ISLAMABAD: At least 293 people have died and over 600 have been injured across Pakistan since late June as glacial lake outbursts, cloudbursts, and relentless monsoon rains triggered catastrophic floods across the country, from the Himalayas to the southern plains.The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has warned of another severe monsoon spell starting July 29, raising fears of fresh flash floods and landslides, especially in northern regions like Swat, Chitral, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Torrential rains have wreaked havoc across the country, sweeping away entire families, burying homes under landslides, and cutting off remote valleys. A sudden cloudburst near Babusar Top and Naran stranded scores of tourists, prompting military-led rescue operations by air and road. Washed-away bridges and blocked highways have hampered relief efforts.The NDMA, provincial agencies, and army teams are on the ground, but operations remain slow and patchy, especially in the hard-to-reach northern areas. Helicopter sorties continue, though poor weather and visibility are disrupting missions.Experts blame successive govts for ignoring climate adaptation and disaster preparedness, despite warnings. “The pattern is repeating itself — glacial melts, erratic monsoons, unprepared institutions. It’s a deadly mix,” said a disaster risk analyst in Islamabad.The crisis echoes the devastating 2022 monsoon floods, which killed over 1,700, submerged a third of the country, and displaced over 30 million people, causing $30 billion in economic losses. Yet, activists say climate resilience remains absent from Pakistan’s national priorities.With more glaciers than any non-polar country, Pakistan faces an increasing frequency of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) due to rising temperatures. Add to that deforestation, poor drainage, and unregulated construction, and experts say even routine monsoons now turn deadly.As another deluge looms, govt has advised evacuations from high-risk zones and warned tourists to stay away from northern areas. But for many already stranded, the warnings have come too late.","At least 293 people have died and over 600 have been injured across Pakistan since late June.

Three Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants were killed in an encounter with Pakistani security forces in Karachi, officials confirmed on Monday.Among those killed was Zafran, who was identified as the mastermind of a November 2024 attack on two Chinese engineers in Pakistan's largest city. He carried a bounty of Rs 20 million.The operation was conducted late Sunday night in the Manghopir area by the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and intelligence agencies, CTD official Raja Umer Khattab told. The TTP men opened fire when they saw security personnel approaching, triggering a firefight which lasted over an hour.Authorities recovered a suicide jacket, three grenades, a Kalashnikov rifle, two pistols, and a large quantity of ammunition from the site.On November 5 last year, a private security guard opened fire on two Chinese nationals at a textile mill in Karachi, injuring both before fleeing.Pakistan has witnessed a sharp increase in militant attacks—particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan—since the TTP ended its ceasefire with the federal government in late 2022.Founded in 2007, the TTP is an umbrella organisation of various extremist groups seeking to impose a strict version of Islamic law across Pakistan. It has claimed responsibility for numerous high-profile attacks, including the 2008 Marriott Hotel bombing in Islamabad, the 2009 assault on army headquarters, and multiple strikes on security installations.","Three Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants were killed in an encounter with Pakistani security forces in Karachi.

Pakistan tribal council threatens highway block over girl’s murder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-tribal-council-threatens-highway-block-over-girls-murder/articleshow/122939897.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: A tribal jirga (council of elders) in Pakistan’s Tank district has threatened to block a stretch of Indus Highway on July 29 after the killing of a nine-year-old girl sparked public outrage. Convened in Tank’s Gul Imam on Saturday, the jirga issued an 11-point charter of demands, warning of a full blockade if authorities fail to respond.Indus Highway (N-55) is a critical national artery that runs along the river, connecting Karachi in Pakistan’s south with Peshawar in the north and cutting through multiple provinces. The planned blockade at Pezu will impact trade routes, passenger transport, and military convoys.The protests gained momentum after a viral video showed residents confronting armed security personnel -- an extraordinary act in this militarised stretch of southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The footage amplified long-standing anger over arbitrary detentions, raids without warrants, and what locals call collective punishment disguised as counterterrorism.“Our decision to block the highway remains. If our demands are accepted, we’ll reconsider.If not, Pezu will be shut down on July 29,” jirga leader Abdul Qayum Kundi said.Police have registered a case in the girl’s death, but authorities have yet to disclose any findings. Locals allege misconduct or negligence by security forces—claims that remain unverified but widely believed within the community.In a bid to defuse tensions, local officials delivered three sheep and (Pak) Rs 2.5 million (around $9,000) to the girl’s family -- an act rooted in tribal custom, meant to symbolise remorse and reconciliation. But jirga members view it as a token gesture. “This is hush money in ceremonial form,” said one elder.The jirga’s demands include the release of detainees not proven to have militant ties, an end to forced house searches, and a halt to arrests of suspects’ relatives. They also call for the return of confiscated weapons and an end to detentions based on vague accusations of mukhbiri (spying).The jirga’s demands echo those of the banned Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM), which for years challenged Pakistan’s security policies in its tribal belt.","A tribal jirga in Pakistan’s Tank district has threatened to block a stretch of Indus Highway.

‘Reject Pakistani Rule’: BNM Accuses Pakistan of Genocide in Balochistan, Launches Armed Resistance

Poll Do you think that protests and appeals by families of the abducted individuals can lead to change? Yes, they can raise awareness. No, they are largely ineffective.





The crisis of enforced disappearances in Pakistan's Balochistan region and beyond has deepened this week, as a disturbing string of abductions emerges from Karachi, Noshki, and Kech, according to The Balochistan Post (TBP).Among the most alarming cases is that of Muslim Dad Baloch, a fourth-semester philosophy student at the University of Karachi.On Monday evening, he was reportedly abducted near the university's Maskan Gate. Eyewitnesses say he was taken by unidentified men in a vehicle while returning to his hostel with friends.Originally from Mashkay in Awaran district, Muslim Dad was a familiar face within the Baloch student community in Karachi. His sudden disappearance has sparked fear among his peers and left his family devastated.In Noshki, another troubling case unfolded earlier today when Hafeezullah, the son of Peer Mohammad and a resident of Qaziabad, was allegedly picked up from his home by Pakistani security forces. His family has raised alarm over his unknown whereabouts and is demanding his immediate release.TBP also reported two recent disappearances in Kech district.On July 23, 16-year-old shopkeeper Qambar Baloch was allegedly taken by men believed to belong to Military Intelligence and the ISI while he was in Jusak, Turbat. And on June 27, Imran Khan, a 26-year-old student of Balochi language and culture at the University of Turbat, was reportedly abducted by Frontier Corps and Military Intelligence personnel in Turbat city—in broad daylight.“These are not isolated cases. This is a pattern,” said a representative from Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP), a group that has long campaigned for the safe recovery of abducted individuals. Despite repeated appeals and protests, most cases remain unresolved, with no accountability or formal investigations.","Muslim Dad Baloch, a fourth-semester philosophy student at the University of Karachi, was reportedly abducted on Monday.

Pakistan Blames India For Tensions, Credits Trump For Ceasefire Between Nuclear Rivals





Beijing/Islamabad: Pakistan army chief Asim Munir, who is on his first visit to China after his elevation as the field marshal, on Friday held talks with top Chinese leaders and discussed ways to deepen cooperation across all sectors. Munir held separate meetings with V-P Han Zheng, top military official general Zhang Youxia and foreign minister Wang Yi, according to official media reports.This is Munir's first visit to China after India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terrorist infrastructure in Pakistam in response to the Pahalgam terror attack. During the conflict, Pakistan used extensive military equipment supplied by China. This is also Munir's first visit to China after his trip to Washington, where he met US President Trump and sought to establish close ties with America, Beijing's strategic rival.The visit coincides with Pakistan's foreign minister Ishaq Dar making a trip to Washington, where he is expected to meet US secretary of state Marco Rubio. Dar was in China July 14 to attend Shanghai Cooperation Organisation foreign ministers' meeting.A Pakistan military statement said that in their talks, the ""Chinese leadership lauded Pakistan armed forces as a cornerstone of resilience and a vital contributor to peace in South Asia.

"Two years on, Imran Khan's sons step in as protest call rattles Islamabad",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/two-years-on-imran-khans-sons-step-in-as-protest-call-rattles-islamabad/articleshow/122911552.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: As jailed former PM Imran Khan completes two years in prison, his sons – Sulaiman and Qasim – have stepped into the political spotlight, launching an aggressive lobbying campaign in the United States to press for their father’s release just days before Khan’s call for a nationwide protest on Aug 5, which has put the state on edge.Khan, arrested on Aug 5, 2023, remains behind bars despite some convictions being overturned. He is currently serving time in three major cases that his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), claims are part of a broader effort to keep him out of politics.He was convicted in the Toshakhana case, involving the illegal sale of state gifts received during his premiership. He was sentenced in the cipher case, accused of leaking classified diplomatic correspondence for political gain. And in the Al-Qadir Trust case, Khan and his wife were held liable for controversial land deals linked to a charitable trust.PTI has consistently maintained that the charges are politically motivated, aimed at “eliminating the most popular leader” in the country.Now, with most of PTI’s senior leadership jailed, exiled, or forced to resign, Khan’s sons have taken the international route. Based in the UK, the brothers have held meetings in Washington DC with US lawmakers, policy groups and human rights organisations, and are reportedly preparing to testify before congressional panels.Their message: Imran Khan is being held in solitary confinement in inhumane conditions, denied light, medical access, and family contact.The campaign has triggered speculation about whether the two sons might return to Pakistan, possibly to appear at the planned protest. While PTI has not confirmed this, party insiders say their presence could act as a powerful morale boost for the party’s dispersed support base.Meanwhile, the state has moved swiftly to neutralise any protest momentum. On July 22, an anti-terror court in Lahore sentenced eight senior PTI leaders, including Dr Yasmin Rashid, to 10 years in prison for their alleged role in the May 9 riots, when military installations were targeted after Khan’s initial arrest. Observers see the convictions as a tactical strike to undercut mobilisation ahead of the Aug 5 protest. The verdicts have raised concerns among legal experts about the selective use of terrorism laws against political opponents.From prison, Khan has issued a call for unity among PTI ranks, urging supporters to “shun differences” and prepare for what he called a decisive moment for Pakistan’s democracy. But the party remains fractured and leaderless, with ongoing rifts between loyalists and factions seen as open to negotiations with the establishment.At the heart of the political storm is the army chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir, who was controversially elevated to five-star rank in May. PTI blames him, along with PML-N and PPP leaders, for orchestrating what it calls a civil-military clampdown to sideline Khan and crush dissent.In a recent prison note, Khan mocked Munir as the “King of the Jungle”, accusing him of ruling the country through “fear, not law”.","Sulaiman and Qasim Khan have launched an aggressive lobbying campaign in the United States to press for their father’s release.
