MUMBAI: Rohit Aarrya had doused the Powai studio with a petrol and rubber solution, threatening to set it ablaze if his demands were not met, according to the FIR filed by assistant police inspector Amol Waghmare, who entered the premises with three other cops to rescue the children and shot the captor in self defence after he “pointed to the pistol tucked in his waist at children’s side for a moment, and then pointed it towards me and my team, and he was about to fire”.Assistant police inspector Amol Waghmare, complainant in the hostage crisis, said in the FIR he reached the RA Studio complex around 2pm when chaos broke out. “A few parents rushed in, shouting that their children were not answering calls. Someone showed me a video circulating on WhatsApp — a man named Rohit Arryya claiming he had taken several children hostage inside the studio. He was threatening to burn the place down if anyone tried to intervene.Within minutes, police teams led by API Sohail Subedar and senior PI Sonawane reached the spot. The atmosphere was tense—parents were crying, and we could smell petrol from outside the studio. The accused doused the premises with a petrol and rubber solution, threatening to set it ablaze if his demands were not met. There were also batteries nearby. Police gained access through a duct and reached the first-floor bathroom where the children were confined.” TOI has a copy of the FIR.The children were kept hostage on the first floor. Waghmare along with sub-inspectors Rakesh Nalawade, Bade and Shinde entered through the bathroom window with the help of fire brigade. “We heard children crying in the bathroom.Then Rohit Aarrya entered and, leaving the children alone, at a distance of about two to three feet, he used a pepper spray, and then pointed to the pistol tucked in his waist... and was about to fire. To save myself, our team and children from being harmed, I fired a shot from my service pistol and he was injured. He was immediately taken to Jogeshwari trauma care hospital and the hostages were rescued and handed over to their parents. ”The FIR stated before the police team entered the studio, Rohan Aher who worked as assistant to Aarrya appeared at the window and told the cops that Aarrya had confined four children with ropes and put adhesive tapes on their mouths. “We saw a person from the window on the first floor saying his name was Rohit Aarrya and he started talking to us policemen. At that time, since his voice was not clear, Sonawane took his mobile number from one Amol Dorugade and called Aarrya on his mobile number. ” Aher is the key witness in the case, said the police.Cops requested him to release the children and promised to fulfil his demands. DCP Datta Nalawade called and tried to talk to him, but he was not stating clearly what his demand was. He threatened on phone that he would set the place on fire and may harm the children, the FIR said.","Rohit Aarrya had doused the Powai studio with a petrol and rubber solution, threatening to set it ablaze if his demands were not met.

Deadly Stampede at Andhra Pradesh After Chaos, Panic Strikes Venkateswara Temple, At Least 10 Dead





VIJAYAWADA: A stampede at a privately run temple in Srikakulam district of Andhra Pradesh killed nine devotees — eight women and a 13-year-old boy — and left more than 25 injured Saturday morning, after a railing collapse on a narrow staircase caused panic in a crowd of over 20,000 gathered for Karthika Ekadashi.The toll may rise as the condition of some of the injured is critical.The Venkateswara Swamy temple, located at Kasibugga under Palasa mandal and modelled on the Tirumala shrine in Tirupati, was built by 94-year-old Hari Mukund Panda from Odisha and opened just four months ago.One gate serving as both entry and exit, poor crowd control, and lack of official clearance turned the pilgrimage into chaos. “Nobody is responsible — it was an act of god,” Panda said.District police chief KV Maheswara Reddy said the main sanctum sits on the first floor with about 20 steps leading to it.“A railing along the staircase, believed to be poorly constructed, collapsed and caused a person to fall, triggering panic as the packed crowd surged forward,” he said.Calling the deaths “extremely heart-breaking”, CM N Chandrababu Naidu said: “Had police been informed in advance, they could have implemented a crowd management plan.Those responsible will face action.”Venkateswara Swamy temple at Kasibugga, visited by around 3,000 devotees on Saturdays, saw a crowd nearly seven times that number on the day of the stampede as it was the first Karthika Ekadashi since the temple’s inauguration. With no prior approval for the gathering or adequate security, the few guards were overwhelmed.District police chief K V Maheswara Reddy said temple authorities failed to alert police or the district administration about the festival and the likely crowd. Police have registered a case under section 100 (culpable homicide) of BNS and detained four temple staff for questioning.The shrine isn’t registered with Andhra Pradesh’s endowments department, which oversees thousands of temples. “Everything looked fine around 9am, but suddenly the number of devotees surged. Narrow stairway was choked. I was nearby when the railing broke and people started falling over each other,” said R Ramanamma, a devotee.The deceasad were identified as E Chinnammi (46), R Vijaya (48) from Tekkali; M Neelamma (60) from Vajrapukotturu; D Rajeswari (60), G Rupa (50), B Brunda from Mandasa; Ch Yasodamma (56) from Nandigam; D Ammulamma from Kasibugga; and L Nikhil (13) from Sompeta. Two women — B Kalavathi and R Kumari — remain critical. “I have instructed officials to ensure proper treatment for the injured,” chief minister Naidu said.PM Modi said he was “pained” by the tragedy. “My thoughts are with those who have lost their near and dear ones. I pray that the injured recover soon,” he said, announcing Rs 2 lakh ex gratia to each victim’s family and Rs 50,000 to the injured.

NEW DELHI: Janata Dal (United) candidate and former Mokama MLA Anant Singh was arrested by the Patna Police on Saturday night in connection with the murder of Jan Suraaj Party worker Dularchand Yadav, the Patna senior superintendent of Police Kartikeya Sharma confirmed.Anant Singh has been arrested along with two associates, Manikant Thakur and Ranjit Ram, from Bedna village.According to officials, a massive police operation involving around 150 personnel was carried out at Singh’s residence in Barh, near Patna, late Saturday night. Singh, a well-known strongman in Bihar politics, was taken into custody and brought to Patna for interrogation. “Further details will be shared during a scheduled press conference at 1:30 am on Sunday,” the SSP said.SSP Patna, Kartikeya K Sharma said, ""... On 30 October, there was a clash between two groups of competing candidates. Stones were pelted resulting in injuries. A dead body was recovered after the incident. The deceased, Dularchand Yadav, aged 75 years, was a resident of the village where this clash occurred... Both sides registered cases, and police started investigating the case... Based on evidence, eyewitness accounts, and the postmortem report of the deceased, it appears that the Model Code of Conduct was violated, and it is a serious issue.It was found that all this happened in the presence of the candidate, Anant Singh, who is also the main accused in the case. Anant Singh has been arrested. His accomplices, Manikant Thakur and Ranjeet Ram, have also been arrested with him... All three will be presented before the magistrate, and due investigation will follow.""Patna DM Thiyagarajan SM said the incident was taken “very seriously.” The Model Code of Conduct will be enforced strictly, he said, adding that all licensed arms must be deposited during polls to ensure peaceful elections.The case pertains to the killing of former RJD leader Dularchand Yadav, who was attacked in the Mokama Tal area on Thursday afternoon while campaigning for Jan Suraaj’s candidate Piyush Priyadarshi. A violent clash reportedly erupted between rival groups, during which Yadav was shot by an unidentified assailant and later run over by a vehicle. The postmortem report released on Friday confirmed that his ribcage was crushed, suggesting he was run over after being shot.An FIR filed by Yadav’s grandson Neeraj Kumar named Anant Singh, his nephews Karamveer and Ranveer, and two others as accused. Police sources said further arrests may follow as the investigation continues.Reacting to the arrest, Jan Suraaj candidate Piyush Priyadarshi told ANI, “This is a good gesture, but it would have been good had they taken action sooner. Today, he was moving around in a convoy of 50 vehicles and even participated in election campaigning. When an FIR was registered against him, he should have been arrested sooner... But better late than never. What is important now is how the police investigate the whole case. .. It is a relief for his family.”Meanwhile, the Election Commission took strong action following the murder, ordering the replacement of the Patna Rural SP and Mokama returning officer, and initiating disciplinary proceedings against three officials for lapses. The poll panel directed the immediate suspension of SDPO Abhishek Singh and sought a compliance report by 12 noon on November 2, 2025.The Mokama Assembly seat, which votes on November 6, has long been notorious as a stronghold of powerful “bahubalis” who wield influence during elections. The killing of Yadav has intensified the political battle in Bihar, with opposition leaders, including RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav, accusing the administration of failing to maintain law and order.","Janata Dal (United) candidate and former Mokama MLA Anant Singh arrested.

“Even Trump Doesn't Know...”: Army Chief on Rapidly Evolving Security Challenges

NEW DELHI: Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi on Saturday addressed a gathering in his hometown Rewa in Madhya Pradesh, where he reflected on Operation Sindoor , spoke about the future of warfare, and even took a dig at US President Donald Trump over his unpredictable statements and recent claims about mediating peace between India and Pakistan.Speaking at an event at TRS College, General Dwivedi highlighted the uncertainty and complexity of emerging global challenges. He said, ""... Future challenges are coming. They're instability, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity... You and I are completely clueless about what the future holds.""He then added, ""What is Trump doing today? I think even Trump doesn't know what he is going to do tomorrow. Challenges are coming so quickly that by the time you try to grasp an old challenge, a new one emerges, and the same security challenges our military faces. Whether it's on the border, terrorism, natural disasters, or cyber warfare. The new things that have started: space warfare, satellites, chemical, biological, radiological, and information warfare. The way rumours are spread. As you heard in Operation Sindoor, Karachi has been attacked. So much such news came, which seemed like news to us too. Where did it come from, who did it?... In the scope of all these challenges, you have to work on land, sky, water and all three...""Speaking to reporters in Rewa, General Dwivedi asserted that India only destroyed terrorist infrastructure in the neighbouring country.In response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack , India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terrorist infrastructure in territories controlled by Pakistan. The strikes triggered four days of intense clashes that ended on May 10 with an understanding to stop military actions.Also read: Foreign policy reset under Trump 2.0?

""We attacked places that had the presence of terrorists. We did not target innocent civilians or defence installations. We achieved our goal in Operation Sindoor and sent a message to Pakistan that we are not like them,"" he said, adding that no action was taken during prayers or namaz.Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that he negotiated a peace deal between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.

Saturday's crush was the third major temple tragedy in Andhra this year.Faith met fury of fate Saturday morning at Kasibugga in Srikakulam when a temple born of one man’s devotion turned into a site of death. Nine devotees were crushed to death at Lord Venkateswara Swamy temple, built by 94-year-old Hari Mukund Panda, reports Umamaheswara Rao.Panda, originally from Odisha, had dreamed of building the shrine after an “unsatisfactory” darshan at Tirupati a decade ago. His mother Hari Vishnupriya had urged him to build a temple of their own. That suggestion became a mission. On 12 acres of family land, Panda created a near-replica of Tirumala — complete with rituals, architecture, and traditions — to bring Lord Venkateswara closer to devotees of north coastal Andhra and southern Odisha.The temple, locally known as ‘chinna-Tirupati’ (mini-Tirupati), opened four months ago. It was built entirely with Panda’s own funds — no donations, no trustees. The 9ft single-stone idol of Lord Venkateswara was carved in Tirupati and dominates the sanctum. Hundreds of other divine idols dot the complex, blending Odisha’s sculptural style with south Indian temple design.But on the temple’s first major festival — Karthika Ekadasi — devotion overwhelmed design. The Ekadasi tithi began at 9.10am, and within minutes, volunteers were overrun.Beyond the temple, Panda is known for quiet philanthropy — feeding hundreds of poor and differently abled people weekly, funding pensions and arranging transport from Palasa railway station to his orchard for Monday meals. Panda said, “I built this temple to offer devotees peaceful and free darshan of Lord Venkateswara, not to witness such deaths.”","A railing collapse on a narrow staircase caused panic in a crowd of over 20,000 gathered for Karthika Ekadashi.

NEW DELHI: At least nine devotees, including eight women and a 13-year-old boy, died and several others were injured after a stampede broke out at the Sri Venkateswara Swamy Temple—popularly known as Chinna Tirupati—in Kasibugga town of Srikakulam district on Saturday morning.According to official reports, the incident occurred around 11:45 am when an estimated 15,000 devotees gathered for Ekadashi darshan at the newly constructed temple, which was inaugurated just four months ago.The temple, privately managed and not registered under the Endowments Department, reportedly had the same route for entry and exit.As per news agency PTI, police said the stampede occurred after an iron railing near the temple steps collapsed due to crowd pressure, triggering panic among devotees.Srikakulam SP KV Maheswara Reddy stated, “It is purely an accident and due to the owner’s mistake. They haven’t applied for police bandobust; there were no permissions also.”Kasibugga DSP Lakshman Rao said, “The public, in fear, thought that something was falling and panicked. They fell from a height of about six feet. There was no stampede.”Seven devotees died on the spot, while two succumbed to their injuries at the Community Health Centre, Palasa.Fifteen people were shifted to the hospital; three remain in serious condition and ten are stable.The deceased have been identified as Eduri Chinnami (Rameswaram), Rapaka Vijaya (Pittalasaria), Muripinti Neelamma (Dukkavanmipeta), Duvvu Rajeswari (Belupatiya), Chinni Yosodamma (Sivarampuram), Rupa (Guddibhara), Lotla Nikhil (13, Benkili), Dokkara Ammulamma (Palasa-Kasibugga), and Bora Brunda (Mandasa).Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu expressed grief over the tragedy, calling it “extremely heartbreaking.”In a post on X, he said, “The stampede incident at the Venkateswara Temple in Kasibugga in Srikakulam district has caused a shock. The death of devotees in this tragic incident is extremely heartbreaking. I have instructed the officials to provide speedy and proper treatment to those who have been injured.”He also ordered an inquiry into the incident and directed district officials to supervise relief operations.Also read: Andhra Pradesh tragedy: Video shows moment panic erupted at Venkateswara Swami temple Deputy chief minister Pawan Kalyan expressed profound grief and announced that the state would strengthen crowd management across temples, especially on spiritually significant days.“It is extremely tragic that nine devotees lost their lives… The fact that a child was also among them has deeply shaken us,” he wrote on X. “The government will take all possible measures to ensure that the injured receive the best treatment… I request the administrative machinery to regulate the crowds of devotees at temples across the state during spiritually significant days.”Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was “pained by the stampede” and announced an ex gratia of Rs 2 lakh each for the next of kin of the deceased and Rs 50,000 for the injured from the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund.“My thoughts are with those who have lost their near and dear ones. I pray that the injured recover soon,” he said on X.President Droupadi Murmu said she was “shocked to learn about the loss of lives,” while Vice President CP Radhakrishnan wrote, “Deeply pained by the tragic stampede… My heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families and prayers for the speedy recovery of the injured.”Andhra Pradesh minister Nara Lokesh said that the tragedy at the Venkateswara Swamy Temple in Kasibugga was the result of an unplanned congregation of devotees, most of whom were visiting the temple for the first time.“Majority of the pilgrims who came here are first timers… It was a slow congregation that resulted in a large group. It was a very unplanned congregation,” he said.Lokesh added that the government will now frame new Standard Operating Procedures (SoPs) not only for temples under the Endowments Department but also for privately managed shrines.“We will devise ways to better monitor and ensure the quality of construction,” he stated.Former chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy accused the government of negligence, saying, “This repeated loss of innocent lives reflects the inefficiency of Chandrababu Naidu’s administration.”Congress leader Rahul Gandhi also expressed deep sorrow and urged the state to “mobilise every resource for relief and to engage with the victims’ families with empathy, dignity, and speed.”Authorities have launched an inquiry into the tragedy, and additional police have been deployed at the temple site to manage the situation.","At least nine devotees, including eight women and a 13-year-old boy, died and several others were injured after a stampede broke out at the Sri Venkateswara Swamy Temple.

Bengaluru Road Rage Horror: Delivery Boy Chased, Crushed To Death By Martial Arts Trainer Couple

Victim Darshan

The accused, Manoj Kumar (32), a martial arts trainer from Kerala, and his wife Aarati Sharma (30)





BENGALURU: A chilling CCTV footage has emerged showing a Kalaripayattu trainer and his wife deliberately mowing down a 24-year-old food delivery agent in a fit of rage — and returning to the crime scene later to collect broken car parts.Police have arrested Manoj Kumar (32), a martial arts trainer from Kerala, and his wife Aarati Sharma (30), from Jammu & Kashmir, in connection with the October 25 incident that killed Darshan, a resident of Kembattalli.The couple, married for five years, has been remanded to 14-day judicial custody.The CCTV footage, accessed by police from Nataraja Layout in South Bengaluru, has revealed the sequence of events that turned a minor brush on the road into a murder.Also read: Delivery boy chased, crushed after road rage spat; martial arts trainer, wife arrested for murder Around 9pm, Darshan’s gearless scooter accidentally brushed against Kumar’s car, slightly damaging its right-side rear-view mirror. Though Darshan apologised and sped away — as he was on his way to deliver food — Kumar allegedly lost his temper.“Losing control of himself, he took a U-turn, chased the scooter, and rammed it from behind,” said a senior investigating officer. “The impact threw Darshan and his pillion rider Varun onto the road.The car didn’t stop.”Locals rushed the duo to a nearby hospital, where doctors declared Darshan brought dead. His sister later filed a hit-and-run case with JP Nagar traffic police.But when investigators examined the CCTV footage, they were stunned. “To our horror, we discovered it was not an accident. The driver deliberately veered left and rammed into the scooter,” a senior officer said.Further footage showed the same car returning to the accident site around 9.40pm. “The couple, wearing masks, parked nearby and collected parts of their car that had broken off during the impact. As they left again, CCTV cameras captured their faces clearly,” the officer added.The footage helped police identify the car and trace the couple to their residence. Deputy commissioner of police (South) Lokesh Jagalasar confirmed the arrests, saying, “The accused have confessed to their involvement.”While Manoj claimed he was alone during the ramming and that Aarati had only accompanied him later to retrieve the car parts, police said they are verifying his version.Darshan, a bachelor, is survived by his parents and sister. His family is demanding strict action against the accused.","Police have arrested Manoj Kumar (32), a martial arts trainer from Kerala, and his wife Aarati Sharma (30), from Jammu & Kashmir, in connection with the October 25 incident.

Chirag Paswan Accuses Owaisi of Dividing Muslims Through Fear Politics

Tejashwi avoids reaction to Owaisi

NEW DELHI: AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi has increased his attack on the opposition Mahagathbandhan, questioning why the alliance has not named any Muslim leader as its deputy chief minister face for the Bihar elections Addressing supporters, Owaisi said, ""Sitting next to Tejashwi Yadav, Mukesh Bhai of the VIP Party, confident in his community's history, declared that the Malla community is with Tejashwi. The Malla community represents 3% of Bihar's population. He declared that if they gain power, he will become the deputy CM... If a Malla's son will become the deputy chief minister, what will the 17% minority community in Bihar do? Are they only to spread 'Dari ' (carpet)?""He added, ""If a Malla's son can become the deputy chief minister, then Mohammad's son can also become the Prime Minister or chief minister. Nothing can stop us from achieving our goals. Remember, the more you dream, the more you trust in Allah's will, and the more you strive along the way, the more you will see the clearer the path will become.""On Tuesday, Owaisi had raised a similar question. He said, ""Why cannot a Muslim, who represents 17 per cent of the state's population, become the chief minister? After all, they seem to have no problem with promising the deputy CM's post to a person who represents only three per cent of the population.""He criticised Congress, RJD and Samajwadi Party, saying these parties seek Muslim votes without offering leadership roles. Owaisi said, ""Parties like Congress, RJD and Samajwadi Party seek votes of Muslims, cashing in on the minority community's fear of the BJP. These parties have not been able to stop the BJP but are still trying to get the votes of Muslims under the same pretext.""He also targeted the BJP. Owaisi said, ""Prime Minister Narendra Modi claims to take all along and strive to work for the progress of all. But his party fails to give tickets, in elections, to a single Muslim.""RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav declined to respond to Owaisi’s remarks. When asked, he said, ""Leave it. What can I say about it?"" Tejashwi is the Mahagathbandhan’s declared chief minister candidate.In the previous assembly elections, AIMIM contested 19 seats and won five, though four of its MLAs later moved to the RJD.In the 2020 Bihar Assembly elections, AIMIM contested 20 seats and won five, all from the Seemanchal belt. Seemanchal includes Araria, Katihar, Kishanganj and Purnia, located close to the West Bengal border. The Muslim population in Bihar is around 17.7%, and Muslims form about 40% of the population in at least 11 constituencies. They have a decisive influence on around 47 seats.The four districts of Kishanganj, Araria, Purnia and Katihar have 24 seats that will go to polls in the second phase. These districts have a high Muslim population. For many years, this region was seen as a strong area for the RJD and Congress. Owaisi first contested here in 2015 but did not win.Before the 2020 elections, AIMIM won a bypoll seat in Kishanganj. In 2020, the party won five seats — two each in Kishanganj and Purnia, and one in Araria. This changed the electoral maths in multiple seats, reducing the RJD-Congress vote share. The NDA finally defeated the Opposition by a slim margin, where a difference of only 12,000 votes separated the two sides in the final seat tally.The Mahagathbandhan released its manifesto on Tuesday, titled 'Bihar Ka Tejashwi Pran'. It promises that within 20 days of forming the government, a law will be passed to give one government job per family.The 2025 Bihar assembly elections will take place between the National Democratic Alliance (BJP, JD-U, Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) and Rashtriya Lok Morcha) and the Mahagathbandhan (RJD, Congress, CPI-ML, CPI, CPM and VIP).Polling will be held in two phases, on November 6 and 11. Counting of votes will take place on November 14.","AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi has increased his attack on the opposition Mahagathbandhan.

NEW DELHI: Panic gripped Mumbai's Powai area on Thursday after a man identified as Rohit Arya allegedly took 19 people hostage, including 17 children, a senior citizen and one unidentified man, inside RA Studio.Arya later died after being injured in the chest during a police crossfire.

Furious Sandringham Residents Slam Andrew’s Move; “He’s A Horrible Man, We Don’t Want Him Here!”

Prince Charles predicted Andrew would 'chase women and play golf'





Why was Andrew stripped of his titles?





Disgraced royal Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor allegedly had 40 prostitutes brought to his five-star hotel over just four days during an official taxpayer-funded trip to Thailand, according to royal historian Andrew Lownie.Speaking on the Daily Mail podcast Deep Dive: The Fall of the House of York, Lownie accused Andrew of using his role as the UK’s Trade Envoy to “chase women and line his pockets”. He claimed the former prince “had no moral boundaries” and often turned official visits into private holidays.Lownie described what he called Andrew’s “spectacular fall from grace” and said British diplomats allowed the alleged incidents to happen.Andrew went to Thailand to celebrate the birthday of the King.“There was a famous trip to Thailand for the birthday celebrations of the King. Andrew is representing his country and insists on staying in a five-star hotel rather than the embassy, which he always did,” Lownie said. “Andrew had 40 prostitutes brought in the space of four days. This was all enabled by diplomats and others.”The historian told podcast host Sarah Vine that his information was verified by multiple sources, including a Reuters correspondent and a member of the Thai royal family.Lownie also claimed that then-Prince Charles had warned against giving Andrew the Trade Envoy role back in 2001, fearing he would “just chase women and play golf.” Despite the warning, Lownie said Charles was overruled by then-Prime Minister Tony Blair and his close ally Peter Mandelson.He described Andrew at the time as “a man in the middle of a midlife crisis.” “In 2001, Andrew is 41, he's having his midlife crisis and he basically starts chasing lots and lots of women,” said Lownie.“He uses the excuse of his role as Trade Envoy, paid for by the taxpayer, to go off on these trips. He always puts in two weeks of ‘private time’. So, we pay for his holiday and then he goes off and does things,"" Lownie added.Beyond the claims of sex-fuelled trips, Lownie said his greater concern was Andrew’s alleged misuse of his trade role for personal gain. He accused the former prince of using the position to further business interests for himself and his associate David Rowlands.Prince Andrew was first stripped of his military titles and royal patronages in January 2022 after facing a civil sexual assault lawsuit in the United States, filed by Virginia Giuffre, who accused him of abusing her when she was 17 — allegations he denied. His association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein had already severely tarnished his public image.Earlier this week, King Charles III went further, removing all of Andrew’s remaining royal titles and honours and evicting him from his Windsor residence, Royal Lodge. The decision followed renewed public outrage after revelations in Giuffre’s posthumous memoir about Epstein’s network and Andrew’s alleged involvement.",Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor allegedly had 40 prostitutes brought to his five-star hotel over just four days during an official taxpayer-funded trip to Thailand.

American rapper Nicki Minaj stirred row after publicly thanking President Donald Trump after he spoke out about the persecution of Christians in Nigeria. Minaj praised Trump’s remarks as “powerful” and “heartfelt,” but some fans accused her of aligning with the MAGA base.Trump, in a Truth Social post on Friday, claimed that “Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria” and that “radical Islamists are responsible for this mass slaughter.” He added, “The United States cannot stand by while such atrocities are happening in Nigeria, and numerous other countries. We stand ready, willing, and able to save our great Christian population around the world!”Minaj shared her response, expressing gratitude. “Reading this made me feel a deep sense of gratitude,” she posted on X. “We live in a country where we can freely worship God. No group should ever be persecuted for practicing their religion. We don’t have to share the same beliefs in order for us to respect each other.”Minaj has been vocal about her Christian faith and its impact on a global scale. “Numerous countries all around the world are being affected by this horror [and] it’s dangerous to pretend we don’t notice,” she said. “Thank you to the president [and] his team for taking this seriously.God bless every persecuted Christian. Let’s remember to lift them up in prayer.”Her comments drew praise from some conservatives but backlash from a portion of her fanbase. Others pointed out that Minaj had previously spoken about social justice and women’s rights, accusing her of inconsistency.The situation in Nigeria remains alarming, with reports of entire villages being destroyed and thousands displaced by Islamist groups. “Even being conservative, it’s probably 4,000 to 8,000 Christians killed annually,” said Mark Walker, Trump’s ambassador-designate for International Religious Freedom. “This has been going on for years, from ISWAP to Islamist Fulani ethnic militias, and the Nigerian government has to be much more proactive. ”Trump has said he directed members of the House Appropriations Committee to investigate and that Nigeria will be redesignated a “country of particular concern” under US law, a label reserved for severe violations of religious freedom.","Nicki Minaj publicly thanked President Donald Trump after he spoke out about the persecution of Christians in Nigeria.

Prince Andrew’s Royal Life ENDS: King Charles Forces Brother Out After Epstein Scandal

What happened

What is next for Andrew





King Charles III, on Thursday, has stripped his brother Andrew of his ‘prince’ title and has ordered him to vacate his Windsor residence, Royal Lodge.The move follows weeks of mounting pressure and public scrutiny over his links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.“These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,” the palace said, as cited by AP. “Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.”The announcement came amid mounting outrage after Virginia Giuffre, a key accuser of Jeffrey Epstein, reiterated her sexual assault allegations against Prince Andrew, claims that he continues to deny.The claims were detailed in her posthumously published memoir, where she recounts how Epstein allegedly trafficked her to have sex with Prince Andrew on three occasions, including twice when she was just 17.Andrew, 65, has consistently denied Giuffre’s allegations but withdrew from royal duties following a widely criticised BBC interview in November 2019, where he sought to defend himself against her claims.Also read: A look at Prince Andrew's former roles and crown perks he’s losing In 2022, he reached a multimillion-pound out-of-court settlement after Giuffre filed a civil lawsuit against him in New York. Though Andrew made no admission of guilt, he expressed regret for Giuffre’s suffering as a victim of sex trafficking.In a 2019 BBC interview, Andrew said he had known British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of media tycoon and former MP Robert Maxwell, since her university days.It was Maxwell who introduced him to her then-partner, Jeffrey Epstein, in 1999. The three maintained a close friendship, even after Epstein’s 2008 conviction for procuring a minor for prostitution and soliciting a prostitute.Andrew is also alleged to have personally invited Epstein and Maxwell to Balmoral, the Queen’s Scottish estate, that same year, as cited by The Independent.In June this year, Maxwell was sentenced to 20 years in prison by a New York court for her role in recruiting and grooming teenage girls for Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse.In a separate development, reports this week also revealed that Prince Andrew had hosted Jeffrey Epstein at Royal Lodge during his daughter Beatrice’s birthday celebrations in 2006, just two months after a US arrest warrant was issued for Epstein over the sexual assault of a minor, as cited by the BBC.Andrew is expected to relocate to a property on the King’s private Sandringham estate in Norfolk, with the move to be privately funded by King Charles.His ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, will also vacate Royal Lodge and make her own living arrangements.Formal notice to surrender the lease at Royal Lodge was issued on Thursday, and Andrew’s move to Sandringham is expected to take place “as soon as practicable.” He will receive a private allowance from the King, while any additional income will be his own responsibility, as reported by The Guardian.Also read: King Charles boots Prince Andrew out of Windsor home, strips all titles over Epstein links Andrew’s daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, will keep their royal titles, and he remains eighth in line to the throne.It marks the most dramatic royal exit since 1936, when King Edward VIII abdicated the throne to marry twice-divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson. The couple were granted the titles Duke and Duchess of Windsor and lived the rest of their lives in exile.In contrast, Prince Harry, despite stepping back from royal duties, moving to California, and his ongoing rift with the family, still retains his title as Prince and Duke of Sussex.","King Charles III has stripped Prince Andrew of his 'prince' title and ordered him to vacate his Windsor residence, Royal Lodge.

Fixing bathrooms in times of crisis?



White House hits back







A row broke out after President Donald Trump proudly unveiled a lavish makeover of the Lincoln Bedroom’s bathroom in the White House, even as the government shutdown dragged into its 31st day.The MAGA chief shared more than 20 photos of the refurbished bathroom on Truth Social. He described the renovation as a tribute to the 16th US President Abraham Lincoln’s era.The new space, he said, is now “covered from floor to ceiling with black and white polished Statuary marble.” Trump claimed the marble “could be the marble that was originally there,” calling the design “very appropriate for the time of Abraham Lincoln.”The bathroom features gold-coloured fixtures, including the taps, wall sconces, and even a gold trash bin, along with a crystal chandelier hanging from the ceiling. Photos also showed a complete redesign in a black, white, and gold palette.However, the remodelling was not taken well by social media and Democrats, who accused Trump of being out of touch during a national crisis. “Donald Trump actually cares more about his toilet than he does about fixing your healthcare,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on X.Democratic activist Harry Sisson said: “Millions of people are being kicked off of food assistance and millions can’t afford health care anymore. But don’t worry everyone! Trump got a new bathroom.” He later called the move “so tone deaf, out of touch, and disgusting.”Adding fuel to the fire, the lavish redesign comes after the US government has temporarily halted funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), leaving millions of low-income families uncertain about their next meal. The pause comes amid a budget standoff in Congress, with lawmakers unable to agree on a spending bill to keep federal aid flowing. SNAP provides food assistance to over 40 million Americans and is a critical lifeline for families struggling with inflation and rising grocery prices.Responding to the backlash, White House spokesman Davis Ingle told CNBC that Democrats were focusing on the wrong issue. “Democrats are more concerned with President Trump’s historic beautification of the White House than they are for American citizens they are hurting because of their reckless government shutdown,” he said.Later that same day, Trump also boasted about inspecting ongoing construction at the Kennedy Center, where he had earlier replaced several board members and appointed himself as chair. “It is really looking good!” he said. “The exterior columns, which were in serious danger of corrosion if something weren’t done, are completed, and look magnificent in White Enamel — Like a different place!”","President Donald Trump proudly unveiled a lavish makeover of the Lincoln Bedroom’s bathroom in the White House.

FBI swoops in after 'pumpkin day' clue





Possible connection to ISIS

Political reaction









A potential ISIS-inspired attack in Michigan was foiled just hours before Halloween, after FBI arrested multiple suspects allegedly plotting a “pumpkin day” assault, reports CNN.The operation was carried out early Friday, preventing what director Kash Patel described as a “violent attack” planned for the holiday weekend.The plan was uncovered after months of online surveillance of a chatroom where several men allegedly discussed carrying out an ISIS-inspired attack in US. According to officials, an undercover FBI operative had been inserted into the group during the early stages of planning.The suspects had recently gone to a shooting range armed with AK-47s and other weapons, practising tactical reloads and firing dozens of rounds. That was when investigators intercepted a spooky reference to “pumpkin day” — believed to be a coded term for Halloween. This led the FBI to act immediately.“This morning the FBI thwarted a potential terrorist attack and arrested multiple subjects in Michigan who were allegedly plotting a violent attack over Halloween weekend,” FBI Director Kash Patel said on X.“Thanks to the men and women of FBI and law enforcement everywhere standing guard 24/7 and crushing our mission to defend the homeland.”Raids were conducted in the Detroit suburbs, where heavily armed FBI and Michigan State Police teams stormed at least three homes. Investigators seized several legally owned firearms, computers and mobile devices as part of their operation.“This all relates to an investigation that started months ago into people who were communicating online with each other here in the United States … but also talking to people overseas, possibly connected to ISIS,” according to CNN’s chief law enforcement analyst John Miller, citing briefings from officials.At least two suspects have been arrested, while three others are being questioned.

Kash Patel pays reimbursement in advance: FBI









The FBI responded to the allegation that director Kash Patel flew on a $60M FBI jet to attend his girlfriend Alexis Wilkins' performance in Pennsylvania, and said he broke no rules while he did that. The allegation came from a former FBI agent-turned-podcaster Kyle Seraphin who commented about Patel flying around the country during the ongoing government shutdown.“We’re in the middle of government shutdown where they’re not even gonna pay all of the employees that work for the agency that this guy heads,” Seraphin said. “And this guy is jetting off to hang out with his girlfriend in Nashville on our dime?”This is not the first time that Kash Patel 's use of FBI jets for personal reasons came under fire. This time, the FBI issued a detailed statement comparing Kash Patel's travels with his predecessors, like Chris Wray and James Comey.The FBI director is not allowed to travel in commercial planes and they are only supposed to travel in government planes. Following the established rules, Director Patel pays a reimbursement in advance, Ben Williamson, assistant director for public affairs at FBI, said.Williamson detailed the steps Kash Patel personally takes to minimize spending. When Patel flies, he chooses to take a government airfield instead of airport like DCA (Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport) as the government option is 2.5X cheaper.Williamson said Chris Wray, James Comey, for example, never did that and they mostly used DCA.""Kash himself has significantly limited personal travel - but he’s allowed to take personal time on occasion to see family, friends or his longtime girlfriend. He doesn’t do it often. He works far more full weekends than he does otherwise. And maybe most importantly - ask anyone who works for him, he’s on duty 24/7 regardless,"" the statement said.",The FBI responded to the allegation that director Kash Patel flew on a $60M FBI jet to attend his girlfriend Alexis Wilkins' performance in Pennsylvania.

'Vote For Bihar’s Future, Not Family Rule': Nitish Kumar Targets Lalu Yadav, RJD In Pre-Poll Message

NEW DELHI: Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad Yadav has drawn sharp criticism from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) after videos of him celebrating Halloween with his grandchildren surfaced on social media on Saturday.The BJP accused the former Bihar chief minister of hypocrisy, pointing out that he had earlier termed the Maha Kumbh festival “meaningless”.The party’s Kisan Morcha, in a post on X, said, “Don’t forget, people of Bihar, this is the same Lalu Yadav who had called the grand festival of faith and spirituality Maha Kumbh useless and is now celebrating the festival of Halloween. Those who attack faith will not get votes from the people of Bihar.”The videos were shared by Lalu’s daughter and RJD leader Rohini Acharya, who posted pictures of the family’s Halloween celebrations with the caption, “Happy Halloween to everyone.” The visuals showed Yadav posing for photos with his grandchildren dressed in costumes.Halloween, observed annually on October 31, is one of the most popular festivals in Western countries. Its roots trace back to the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, which marked the close of the harvest season and the onset of winter - a period once thought to dissolve the boundary between the living and the dead.In modern times, the celebration features costumes, trick-or-treating, pumpkin carving, eerie decorations, and themed parties.Lalu had sparked a row in February this year after he called the Maha Kumbh festival in Prayagraj “faltu"" (meaningless). Asked about the large crowds attending the religious gathering, he had said, “The Kumbh has no meaning… It is just meaningless.” His comment came while reacting to a stampede at the New Delhi railway station that left 18 people dead and several injured as passengers rushed to board trains bound for the religious congregation.Asked about the massive crowds travelling to Prayagraj and measures for crowd management, the RJD chief had said, “Kumbh ka kahan koi matlab hai. Faltu hai Kumbh (Is there any meaning to Kumbh? It is just meaningless).”The remarks triggered strong criticism from the BJP and several Hindu religious leaders, who accused Yadav of politicising the tragedy. Bihar BJP spokesperson Manoj Sharma said the statement reflected the RJD’s “mindset towards Hinduism”, while deputy chief minister Vijay Kumar Sinha charged the RJD leader with insulting Sanatana dharma and engaging in politics over the deaths.The fresh exchange between the BJP and RJD comes just days before the Bihar assembly elections, with polling scheduled in two phases on November 6 and 11 for the 243-seat assembly. Counting of votes will take place on November 14.","Lalu Prasad Yadav has drawn sharp criticism from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) The BJP accused the former Bihar chief minister of hypocrisy, pointing out that he had earlier termed the Maha Kumbh festival ""meaningless"" The fresh exchange comes just days before the Bihar assembly elections.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125028769,imgsize-1026852,width-400,resizemode-4/lalu-yadav-with-his-grandchildren-rohiniacharya2.jpg"

Honduran man tries to loot ex-serviceman’s shop





HYDERABAD: A 32-year-old Honduran architect working in Texas was arrested on Saturday evening from his in-laws' house in Kapra for attempting to rob an ex-serviceman who runs a Western Union outlet in Kushaiguda.The accused, Hernandez Tabora, also known as Gilmer Eludin, had recently married a woman from Hyderabad and was preparing to return to the US.Police said the accused had arrived in India on Sept 22 to marry his fiancee from Kapra, whom he met while studying at Alabama University (2016-18). The couple married on Sept 27 and were planning to leave for the US soon.During his stay, Hernandez frequently visited a Western Union money transfer outlet at Sainikpuri, operated by 57-year-old ex-serviceman Srinivas, who also runs a water purifier business. On Friday evening, an armed man wearing a helmet and mask entered the shop after Srinivas returned from a walk. ""He closed the door and, at knifepoint, tried to take away the cash bag,"" said Kushaiguda detective inspector Venkateshwarulu.Srinivas resisted and struck the attacker with a water bottle. The assailant fled with about ₹2 lakh, but Srinivas chased him for nearly 50 metres and managed to snatch the bag back before he could escape on a scooter.CCTV footage led police to identify Hernandez, who was arrested from his in-laws' home.Based on Srinivas's complaint, police registered a case under section 312 (attempt to commit robbery when armed with a deadly weapon) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.Police said Hernandez's wife was unaware of his plan and that he was already married with two children in Honduras. He will be produced before a magistrate for judicial remand.","A 32-year-old Honduran architect working in Texas was arrested on Saturday evening from his in-laws' house in Kapra.

JD Vance-Usha Vance rumors







Vice President JD Vance came under a lot of fire Thursday after he sided with Christianity and expressed his wish that his Hindu wife Usha Vance who, according to JD is not a very religious person, embrace Christianity. JD Vance converted to Catholicism in August 2019, long after JD Vance's marriage to Usha Vance.It was a major MAGA implosion moment as social media users started 'shipping' JD Vance with Erika Kirk, widow of Charlie Kirk -- politically and also romantically.A few weeks ago, MAGA commentators floated the idea of a Vance-Kirk ticket for 2028 -- JD Vance being the presidential candidate and Erika Kirk, the VP candidate. JD Vance is currently the top choice for the 2028 presidential candidate, apart from Marco Rubio. But in the past few weeks, support for Vance-Kirk grew louder for Vance-Rubio. But after Vance addressed the Turning Point USA event at the University of Mississippi, the chatter took a different turn and many MAGA supporters insinuated that JD Vance will divorce Usha Vance and will remarry Erika Kirk before his 2028 run because they argued that JD Vance knows America will not accept a 'Hindu First Lady'.The photo of Erika Kirk and JD Vance hugging invited criticism for Erika Kirk as well as she was accused of cosying up with JD Vance on the stage.Former White House press secretary Jen Psaki recently made some comments about JD Vance and his relationship with Usha Vance saying that Usha is scared of him. ""I think the little Manchurian candidate, JD Vance, wants to be president more than anything else,"" Psaki said. ""I always wonder what's going on in the mind of his wife. Like, are you OK? Please blink four times. We'll come over here. We'll save you,"" Jen Psaki said.""And that he's willing to do anything to get there. And your whole iteration you just outlined, I mean, he's scarier in certain ways in some ways. And he's young and ambitious and agile in the sense that he's a chameleon who makes himself whatever he thinks the audience wants to hear from him,"" Psaki said.JD Vance said the comments are disgraceful, but the Second Lady can speak for herself. ""I am very lucky to have a wonderful wife. I hope that my wife feels the same about me. We will keep on serving the country together,"" JD Vance recently said when he was in Israel with his wife.","JD Vance converted to Catholicism in August 2019, long after JD Vance's marriage to Usha Vance.

Marco Rubio condemns Hamas









US Central Command accused Hamas operatives of looting an aid truck, which was traveling as part of a humanitarian convoy delivering needed assistance from international partners, in the southern Gaza Strip on Saturday.CENTCOM shared a drone video showing the attack on the truck and said that the Operatives attacked the driver and stole the aid and truck after moving the driver to the road’s median.In a statement, CENTCOM said the US-led Civil-Military Coordination Center (CMCC) — which is based in Kiryat Gat — “observed suspected Hamas operatives looting an aid truck traveling as part of a humanitarian convoy delivering needed assistance from international partners to Gazans in northern Khan Younis.”The CMCC was alerted to the incident through video surveillance from an American MQ-9 drone flying over Gaza as part of monitoring of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. “Operatives attacked the driver and stole the aid and truck after moving the driver to the road’s median. The driver’s current status is unknown,” CENTCOM said.The CENTCOM said that over the past week, international partners have delivered more than 600 trucks of commercial goods and aid into Gaza daily.This incident undermines these efforts. Nearly 40 nations and international organizations represented at the CMCC are working together to help flow humanitarian, logistical and security assistance into Gaza.Secretary of State Marco Rubio sharply condemned Hamas on Saturday after a US military drone video surfaced showing suspected operatives of the terror group looting a truck carrying humanitarian aid bound for civilians in Gaza.“Hamas continues to deprive the people of Gaza of the humanitarian aid they desperately need,” Rubio wrote on X. “This theft undermines international efforts in support of President Trump’s 20 Point Plan to deliver critical assistance to innocent civilians.”Rubio said Hamas remains “the impediment,” accusing the terror group of blocking relief intended for civilians. “They must lay down their arms and stop their looting so that Gaza can have a brighter future,” he added.The CMCC opened on Oct. 17 in southern Israel as a central hub for Gaza aid just days after a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas went into effect.The centre serves as the main hub for Gaza stabilisation efforts and includes an operations floor designed to track real-time developments inside Gaza.Data published in August by the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) showed that most of its aid entering the war-torn Gaza Strip had been looted inside the Palestinian territory.","US Central Command accused Hamas operatives of looting an aid truck, which was traveling as part of a humanitarian convoy delivering needed assistance from international partners. “Operatives attacked the driver and stole the aid and truck after moving the driver to the road’s median,” CENTCOM said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125028457,imgsize-4552968,width-400,resizemode-4/us-military-shares-drone-footage-showing-hamas-operatives-looting-aid-from-gaza-convoy-image-credit-x.jpg"

Panic and chaos gripped passengers on a London-bound train on Saturday evening after a mass stabbing left ten people hospitalised, nine with life-threatening injuries. Witnesses described scenes of terror as a man armed with a large knife moved through the carriages, sending passengers fleeing for their lives.One passenger told Sky News he saw a man “extremely bloodied” stumble through the carriage shouting, “They’ve got a knife, I’ve been stabbed.” He said, “That person ended up collapsing on the floor. They were taken to an ambulance pretty much straight away.” Others recalled people sprinting through the train to escape as the attacker moved through carriages.Wren Chambers, who was also on board, told the BBC they ran to the front of the train after seeing a man bolt past with a bloody arm, shouting “they’ve got a knife, run.” “We were pretty scared once we knew what was happening,” Chambers said. “We were able to get off the train unharmed.”When the train came to an emergency stop in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, armed officers stormed the station. A witness described seeing police “directing their weapons at a man on the platform with a large blade.” The suspect was eventually “tasered and restrained,” said another passenger, Gavin.“He then was waving a knife, quite a large knife, and then they detained him. I think it was a Taser that got him down in the end,” he told Sky News.Passengers described “blood everywhere” and people hiding in toilets as the attack unfolded. One told The Times that others were getting “stamped on” in the rush to escape. Another described the horror as “like something from a film — really violent.”British Transport Police confirmed ten people were taken to hospital, nine with “life-threatening injuries.” Counter-terrorism officers are assisting with the investigation, though the motive remains unclear. The national “Plato” emergency response protocol used for potential terror attacks was activated.Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the incident “appalling” and “deeply concerning,” praising emergency services for their swift action. “My thoughts are with all those affected,” he said.Police arrested two suspects at the scene and continue to examine the train, which remains cordoned off as a major crime scene. The East of England Ambulance Service said it deployed a “large-scale response,” including air ambulances and tactical teams.Cambridgeshire mayor Paul Bristow said he was aware of “horrendous scenes,” adding that his “thoughts and prayers” were with those injured.","A mass stabbing on a London-bound train left ten people hospitalised, nine with life-threatening injuries.

The White House turned into a haunted mansion with a presidential twist on Thursday night, as President Donald and Melania Trump hosted a Halloween spectacle straight out of a comic book.Superheroes, dinosaurs, and even pint-sized Trumps and Melanias stormed the South Lawn — while the First Couple, skipping costumes, made a dramatic entrance to the spooky strains of Thriller, AP image.They handed out chocolate to hundreds of costumed children, just hours after the president returned from a five-day swing through Asia.The Trumps took a particular liking to three siblings dressed as a Secret Service agent, the President and the First Lady.Trump gave his doppelganger a high-five before asking the trio to turn around and pose for photographs. The President pointed to the young girl and appeared to mouth, “Melania,” to reporters.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller were among the administration officials partaking in the festivities.Leavitt and her husband, Nicholas Riccio, brought their 1-year-old son in an adorable jack o’lantern outfit.Miller, wearing a suit and tie, was spotted trying to wrangle his young son, who appeared to be in a ghost costume, while his wife, Katie, held their other child, both dressed as skeletons.One of the most unusual costumes belonged to a boy who came dressed as a filthy toilet, with a “wide load” sign on the back. Trump seemed amused by the party pooper and gave him a chocolate bar. One of the most clever ensembles may have been a family who outfitted their wagon to look like a McDonald’s drive-thru.The Halloween event is an annual White House tradition. Last year, former President Joe Biden awkwardly pretended to bite several infants in the rope line, including one dressed up as a chicken.Perhaps the most memorable Trump Halloween moment took place in 2019, when he placed a candy bar on the head of a kid in a Minion costume during his first term. Trump did it again this year, with a youngster in an unidentified costume with particularly flat headgear.","The White House turned into a haunted mansion with a presidential twist on Thursday night.

Nearly a month into the shutdown, food banks across the country were straining to meet rising demand from hundreds of thousands of federal workers who were furloughed or working without pay and were bracing for an even bigger surge as benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program were set to lapse on Nov. 1.More than one in eight Americans depended on food stamps from SNAP, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Recipients received an average of $187 a month on a prepaid card to buy groceries, and many families relied on those benefits as their main source of money for food, CBS news reported.The Community Table Food Bank in Arvada, Colorado, was so inundated with people on Thursday that it had to temporarily close. Before it did, Danielle Brann, a SNAP recipient, obtained essentials including ham and crackers and cans of spaghetti sauce.“The line started at 9 o’clock this morning and I don’t remember ever seeing it this busy. I mean they’re turning people away. So it’s more of a demand for sure,” Brann said.In Delaware County, Pennsylvania, the Loaves and Fishes Food Pantry also had to turn people away on Tuesday because food was leaving the shelves faster than it could be restocked.Vice President JD Vance and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned that Americans could face a travel “disaster” as Thanksgiving approaches next month without an end in sight to the govt shutdown.Their comments came after Vance hosted a roundtable of aviation, travel and union leaders at the White House, during which they aired their concerns with the current state of the industry and worked out potential, temporary solutions to ease the strain on Federal Aviation Administration employees who were being forced to work without pay to ensure Americans could fly safely, two White House officials told CNN.“Look it could be a disaster.

How many of them are not going to show up for work?” Vance said.“That’s going to lead to massive delays. We want people to be able to get home for Thanksgiving.

Meanwhile, the Military Family Advisory Network estimated that 27% of families had £380 or less in emergency savings.The Pentagon said it had accepted a $130m gift from a wealthy donor to help pay salaries during the shutdown, which worked out to $100 for each of the 1.3 million service members expecting to be paid.The White House planned to pay the troops on 31 October by using money from a military housing fund, a research-and-development account and a defence procurement fund, according to Axios.Earlier this month the administration made payroll by moving $6.5bn from military research. More than 160 families told the National Military Family Association that they had been underpaid during the shutdown, some by hundreds of dollars and others by thousands.If the shutdown continues, then some 4.5 million paycheques would have been withheld from civilian employees, representing about $21bn in missing wages, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.Furloughed employees were typically paid after shutdowns ended, although Trump had threatened to withhold pay and was attempting to fire thousands of workers, a move being challenged in court.Thousands of air traffic controllers missed their first paycheques this week. And if it continues, then the flight delay will also continue.Because they are considered essential workers, the workers must continue to do their jobs without pay during the shutdown. Since 1 October, numerous controllers have called in sick and now many report they are getting second jobs.","More than one in eight Americans depended on food stamps from SNAP, according to the US Department of Agriculture.

Is Barack Obama supporting Zohran Mamdani in NYC Mayoral Race? Inside their 30-minutes call,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/is-barack-obama-supporting-zohran-mamdani-in-nyc-mayoral-race-inside-their-30-minutes-call/articleshow/125027638.cms,"Zohran Mamdani Hits Back At Islamophobia, Says 'No More Silence' In NYC Mayoral Race





Former US President Barack Obama seems to be supporting assembly member Zohran Mamdani for the New York mayoral election.According to the New York Times, Obama called Mamdani on Saturday, praising his mayoral campaign and offering to serve as a “sounding board” for the candidate. The two spoke for about 30 minutes in what is believed to be their second phone conversation since June.Mamdani has shaken up the New York City mayoral race by winning the Democratic nomination over former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who is now running as an independent. He led in polls against both Cuomo and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa.Obama has not formally endorsed a mayoral candidate but publicly supported California Democrats’ Proposition 50 on redistricting.He is campaigning in Virginia and New Jersey for Democratic gubernatorial candidates Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill respectively.According to two people familiar with the matter, Obama told Mamdani he was invested in his success and discussed early challenges of staffing a new administration and delivering on pledges such as an affordability agenda.“Your campaign has been impressive to watch,” Obama said, noting Mamdani’s effective social media and voter outreach strategies.He also offered to be a sounding board and spoke of meeting in person at a later date. Mamdani reportedly thanked Obama for the call.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters this week, “We’re continuing to talk,” when asked if he would vote for Mamdani, Newsweek reported.In an October 28 memo the National Republican Congressional Committee said, “[House Minority Leader] Hakeem Jeffries’ endorsement of Zohran Mamdani confirms what NRCC polling and research already showed: the Democratic Party has been hijacked by the radical left. Mamdani is a socialist hostile to America, supports an agenda ripped directly from the pages of the Communist Manifesto, is openly anti-police, and is funded by groups with ties to terrorist organizations like Hamas. His platform, defunding police, raising taxes, and embracing socialism, is out of step with what the American people want and need.”Patrick Gaspard, an adviser to Mamdani and former political director on Obama’s 2008 campaign, told the Times, “The fact that he [Obama] placed that phone call to us [Mamdani]—and then the news of that call making its way into the world—was a very important signaler to many in the political establishment, the business establishment, to average voters that helped credential Zohran Mamdani.”New York Attorney General Letitia James said in an X post on Saturday, “It was great to join @ZohranKMamdani in Brooklyn today for service at Hanson Place SDA Church. This is the last weekend to vote early before Election Day, New York! Get out and vote and let’s make @ZohranKMamdani the next Mayor of New York City!”Meanwhile, independent candidate Andrew Cuomo wrote on November 1, “The gap is closing fast -- we can feel it on the ground everywhere from the Bronx to Staten Island. At this rate, we win the race. Keep going strong.” Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa posted on October 31, “Two names, one mask: Mamdani = Cuomo. New Yorkers know this. Vote Curtis Sliwa and end the horror show.”","Zohran Mamdani has shaken up the New York City mayoral race by winning the Democratic nomination over former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.

US President Donald Trump threatened US military intervention in Nigeria and will halt the aid if the Nigerian government “continues to allow the killing of Christians.”In a post on Truth Social, Trump instructed the Department of War to prepare for possible action in Nigeria“If the Nigerian Government continues to allow the killing of Christians, the U.S.A. will immediately stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria, and may very well go into that now disgraced country, “guns-a-blazing,” to completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities,” the president said.“I am hereby instructing our Department of War to prepare for possible action.”He added, “WARNING: THE NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT BETTER MOVE FAST!” On Friday, Trump designated Nigeria as a “country of particular concern,” a legal status from the US State Department for countries “responsible for particularly severe violations of religious freedom,” saying that “Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria.”On Friday, Trump threatened possible sanctions against the West African nation, declaring it a “country of particular concern” in terms of religious freedom — a classification Nigeria’s president pushed back on.Nigeria’s population of 220 million, the largest in Africa, is largely split between Christians and Muslims, with insurgent groups like Boko Haram seeking to impose a version of Islamic rule that has led to persecution of both faiths.In response to the president’s claims, Nigeria’s president, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, posted that to label his country as religiously intolerant “does not reflect our national reality. Religious freedom has been a core tenet of our collective identity and shall always remain so.”Trump’s threats on Truth Social follow Senator Ted Cruz’s accusations earlier this month that Nigeria was enabling a “massacre” of Christians and citing rising attacks against the group.The bipartisan United States Commission on International Religious Freedom has also urged the US govt to designate Nigeria a country of particular concern in its 2025 annual report, noting persecution of both Christians and Muslims.The Texas senator introduced legislation to sanction Nigerian officials who are “ignoring and even facilitating the mass murder of Christians by Islamist jihadists.”In August, the US began deploying a naval and military presence in the southern Caribbean, off the coast of Venezuela, conducting lethal strikes against small vessels in international waters, alleging narcotics-smuggling activity.The Department of Defense and the Nigerian Embassy did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Associated Press has reported that attacks in Nigeria have varied motives, from religiously motivated assaults targeting both Christians and Muslims to regional and communal clashes.While Christians are among those targeted, analysts told the AP that most victims of armed groups are Muslims in Nigeria’s predominantly Muslim north.","US President Donald Trump threatened US military intervention in Nigeria.

'She Has No Plans To Convert': JD Vance Clarifies Amid Row Over Remark On Wife's Faith





British Muslim journalist Mehdi Hasan weighed in on Vice President JD Vance’s comments about his Indian-origin wife Usha’s Hindu faith, saying conservative Hindus who sided with Donald Trump ’s MAGA movement are now realising that Christian nationalists are not their friends.In a recent interview, Vance said he hopes his wife, Usha — who grew up in a Hindu household — is “one day moved by the same thing that moved me in church.” His comments drew criticism for being dismissive of her religion and for echoing Christian nationalist rhetoric.The Hindu American Foundation (HAF) responded to Vance, urging him to reciprocate and engage with Hinduism if Usha is expected to follow Christian ideals.In a post on X, the organisation said Hinduism “doesn’t share the need to wish your spouse comes around to see things as you do in terms of religion,” describing it as “inherently inclusive and pluralistic.”HAF also pointed out the “outpouring of anti-Hindu sentiment online,” much of it from “explicitly Christian sources.”As uproar mounted, Vance hit back, calling the backlash “disgusting” and accusing detractors of “anti-Christian bigotry.”He defended himself, saying, “My wife encouraged me to re-engage with my faith… She is not a Christian and has no plans to convert, but like many interfaith couples, I hope she may one day see things as I do.”Vance was responding to a post that read: “It’s weird to throw your wife’s religion under the bus, in public, for a moment’s acceptance by groypers.”Hasan then joined the debate, replying to the Hindu Foundation and arguing that Vance’s remarks were a wake-up call for conservative non-Christian minorities.In a post on X, Hasan wrote: “Conservative Jews and conservative Hindus who threw in with Trump and the GOP are now belatedly realising what some of us tried to warn them: that the Christian nationalists of the MAGA GOP are not their friends.”",British Muslim journalist Mehdi Hasan weighed in on Vice President JD Vance's comments about his Indian-origin wife Usha’s Hindu faith.

Erika Moment Fuels JD Vance–Usha Split Talk | Watch





A fresh row erupted inside the MAGA movement after JD Vance revealed he hopes his wife, Usha Vance, will one day embrace his Christian faith despite her Hindu upbringing. The episode raises a critical question: how will a movement that prizes religious identity accept a spouse from a different faith?Vance made the comments at a conservative event, saying he and his wife — who married in 2014 and have three children — had decided to raise their kids as Christians. “Do I hope eventually that she is somehow moved by the same thing that I was moved in by church? Yeah, honestly I do wish that,” he said. “But if she doesn’t, then God says everybody has free will and so that doesn’t cause a problem for me.”For many MAGA supporters, alignment of religion and culture is non-negotiable. Vance’s wife, however, comes from a Hindu Indian-American background. The vice president’s comments prompted immediate pushback from Hindu-American voices, who accused him of religious insensitivity and pandering to Christian nationalists.Vance later attempted to clarify that he respects his wife’s beliefs and rejected claims that his comments were bigoted. “My wish for her is grounded in love,” he said, adding that she “is the most amazing blessing I have in my life.” But the question remained whether the message would resonate within a base that often views cultural and religious conformity as a test of loyalty.The timing of the controversy matters. Vance is widely seen as a rising star in the MAGA movement and a potential contender for higher office; every personal detail is under intense surveillance.A spouse’s background, once a private matter, has now become a public litmus test for acceptability inside a movement that often prizes religious and cultural homogeneity.Vance faces a deeper challenge than policy or persona: he must reassure a faith-driven base that his interfaith marriage does not dilute the cultural purity they expect.Conservative commentator Dinesh D’Souza defended Vance, saying it was normal for Christians to hope their loved ones share their faith. Turning Point USA figures and attendees also appeared to back Vance, applauding his remarks and describing them as “heartfelt” and “honest.”However, major top GOP leaders — including Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, Tucker Carlson, and Donald Trump Jr. — have not publicly weighed in on the controversy.","JD Vance said he hopes his wife will one day embrace his Christian faith.

COP30 snub: US to skip top-level presence in Brazil; Donald Trump ‘directly engaging’ with leaders on energy issues,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cop30-snub-us-to-skip-top-level-presence-in-brazil-donald-trump-directly-engaging-with-leaders-on-energy-issues/articleshow/125017542.cms,"File photo: US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)

America Is All In





The United States will not send any top officials to the COP30 climate talks in Brazil later this month, a White House official confirmed on Saturday, as President Donald Trump focuses on boosting fossil fuels rather than global climate negotiations.Trump, who withdrew from the Paris Agreement for the second time after returning to the White House in January, had already been expected to skip the leaders’ summit ahead of the annual UN climate conference in Belém.However, it now appears no senior American negotiators will attend the talks scheduled from November 10 to 21 either.“The US is not sending any high-level representatives to COP30,” a White House official said on condition of anonymity, as cited by news agency AFP.“The president is directly engaging with leaders around the world on energy issues, which you can see from the historic trade deals and peace deals that all have a significant focus on energy partnerships”, the source added.Brazil has said fewer than 60 world leaders have confirmed attendance for the November 6–7 summit.The leaders of France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands, Norway, Colombia, Chile, Cape Verde and Liberia are expected to attend, while China will be represented by Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang.The move comes as Trump’s administration continues its rollback of multilateral climate commitments. “The Green New Scam would have killed America if President Trump had not been elected to implement his commonsense energy agenda – which is focused on utilizing the liquid gold under our feet,” White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said, as per The Guardian.She added that Trump “will not jeopardise our country’s economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals.”Earlier this year, the US state department closed its climate office, and the post of climate envoy was scrapped. The administration has also used its diplomatic leverage to promote fossil fuel interests, even threatening countries that supported the UN’s carbon pricing system under the International Maritime Organisation.While the federal government steps back, more than 100 US state and local leaders, including governors and mayors, are still expected to attend COP30.“We are showing up in force,” said Gina McCarthy, co-chair of thecoalition, according to AFP. “Local leaders here have authority to act on their own behalf, to take climate action at home and abroad.”The absence of a high-level US delegation comes as many countries struggle to finalise new emissions targets before the summit. Former US climate negotiator Todd Stern said, “The president has made it clear he wants to withdraw from the Paris agreement so it doesn’t surprise me they aren’t sending anyone because they aren’t engaged in this.”In all, 170 delegations are accredited for COP30, which is set to take place amid global political turmoil that many fear could overshadow the climate crisis.","The United States will not send any top officials to the COP30 climate talks in Brazil later this month, a White House official confirmed on Saturday.

‘Pak Is Infuriated With…’: MEA Slams Pakistan Over Border Tensions With Afghanistan





Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan’s (TTP) second-in-command Amjad, a key figure in the banned militant group, was killed along with three other militants when security forces foiled an infiltration attempt from Afghanistan into Pakistan, the army said on Thursday.According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), cited by PTI, the militants tried to cross the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Bajaur district on Wednesday night when their movement was detected.“The troops effectively engaged and thwarted the militants' attempt to infiltrate,” the statement said, adding that four militants, including high-value target Amjad alias Mazahim, were “sent to hell.”Amjad, who served as deputy to TTP chief Noor Wali and headed the group’s Rehbari Shura, was among Pakistan’s most wanted militants, carrying a bounty of Rs five million. The ISPR said he was “actively involved in perpetuating numerous terrorist activities inside Pakistan while residing in Afghanistan.”The army also urged the interim Afghan government to take “concrete measures to ensure that Afghan soil is not used by militants to perpetrate terrorism against Pakistan.”Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif lauded the security forces for eliminating the TTP commander and his aides. Prime Minister Shehbaz said the security forces, through their professional expertise, eliminated the highly wanted TTP commander Amjad and thwarted “the nefarious designs of the enemies of Pakistan's sovereignty.” He added, “We will continue to defeat the elements that harm innocent people. ”The operation in Bajaur came a day after six Pakistani soldiers, including a captain, were martyred during an intelligence-based operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kurram district, where seven terrorists were also gunned down.Formed in 2007 as an umbrella organisation of several militant outfits, the TTP seeks to impose its strict version of Islam across Pakistan. The group, believed to have close ties with al-Qaeda, has claimed responsibility for numerous deadly attacks, including the 2008 Marriott Hotel bombing in Islamabad and the 2009 assault on army headquarters.","Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan’s (TTP) second-in-command Amjad, a key figure in the banned militant group, was killed along with three other militants.
