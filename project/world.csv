Pannun used Sikhs for Justice role as cover to inflict war on India: Tribunal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pannun-used-sfj-role-as-cover-to-inflict-war-on-india-tribunal/articleshow/117790552.cms,"NEW DELHI: Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), banned as an “unlawful association” under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act , is a frontal organisation of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun , who as the outfit’s legal adviser is using his “juristic identity” as a cover to perpetrate war upon India in league with other agencies and state-and non-state actors of foreign countries, a tribunal led by Justice Anoop Kumar Mendiratta ruled while upholding the ban on the pro-Khalistani outfit earlier this month.The background note submitted by the government to the tribunal, detailing the activities of SFJ, states that the all activities of the outfit are usually carried out from offices of Pannun, an attempt on whose life in the US, allegedly involving a former Indian government officer, had become an irritant in Indo-US tied until they agreed to cooperate on the case, with a panel set up by India recently recommending “legal action” against the “individual”.The government of India’s background note on SFJ and Pannun, submitted before the tribunal, records that the outfit has repeatedly threatened India’s political leaders, government officers including the police, diplomats, judiciary and even their family members and families abroad. These include Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah, external affairs minister S Jaishankar, chief minister and minister of Punjab, national security adviser, and RAW chief. The note reveals that SFJ organises protests and filing of baseless cases against visiting Indian dignitaries abroad, particularly in Europe, Canada and US, to defame them and to fan anti-India sentiments among the Sikh diaspora.Stating that SFJ has been organising anti-India protests outside Indian embassies or consulates, where its activists have raised Khalistan flags and even dishonoured the Indian flag and indulged in violence and vandalisation of the premises, the documents filed with the tribunal reveal that many of the protests had the active support of Pakistani missions and were in tandem with multiple ISI-backed Pakistani diaspora outfits and Kashmiri diaspora. They also said Hindu temples in Canada and Australia were defaced with Khalistani graffiti and ISIS exhorted by SFJ after the deadly ISIS attack on Gurdwara Kart-e-Parwan in Kabul, Afghanistan, to target the Indian embassies rather than gurdwaras.The note directly names Pannun for having instigated the Indian farmers protesting against the three farm bills to arm themselves and fight against the Indian forces with weapons that would reach them from across the border (Pakistan). It said he has conspired with other Khalistani leaders like UK-based Babbar Khalsa International leader Paramjit Singh Pamma as well as Canada based terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who was shot dead in 2023, to revive terrorism in Punjab.SFJ, according to the government’s submission, has been inciting Sikh personnel to desert the Army and police forces. He had urged Sikh Soldiers to join the SFJ movement and offered them Rs 5000 more than the salary given by the Indian government. He also tried to provoke the Sikh soldiers posted in Ladakh to not to fight for India against Chinese aggression.SFJ has also been colluding with the gangsters, terrorists and other radical elements including Kashmir separatists. Not only this, it has been inciting non-Sikh communities including Muslims and Tamils, as also Christians in Manipur to secede from India.As many as 104 cases have been registered against SFJ elements, including 96 by various state police and 8 by NIA.“Vitriolic speeches made by Gurpatwant Singh Pannun glorifying militants such as Bhinderwalan & Nijjar, making calls to assassinate Constitutional functionaries of the country, calling for a referendum which is nothing but a plebiscite, taken jointly or individually... constitute “sufficient cause” for confirming the decision of the Union of India to extend the declaration of SFJ as unlawful association for a further period of five years,” the tribunal stated while upholding the ban on January 3 this year.","Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) banned as an “unlawful association’ under Unlawful Activities Prevention Act.

HYDERABAD: In a shocking incident, two siblings stayed with their mother’s body in a rented house for around ten days at Warasiguda in the city before coming out and reporting the matter to the police. The siblings, identified as C Ravali , 25, and C Yashwitha , 22, told the police that their mother, C Lalitha, 45, died on January 23.Seeing her dead, they slipped into depression, collapsed, and fell unconscious.During these ten days, they gained consciousness a couple of times but could not come out of the home or inform anyone about their mother’s death as they were weak physically and mentally, the girls told the cops on Friday. They survived only on water, the women told the cops.Police shifted the body for PME and started an investigation. “At this moment, there does not seem to be any foul play behind the death, but the exact cause of death would be known from the PME report,” said R Saidulu, Station House Officer, Warasiguda. The girls said they got afraid after seeing their mother dead as their father already left them, and now with their mother’s death, they would be left orphans, added Saidulu.Police said that all these days, none of the neighbours noticed any smell from the house or even checked on the inmates, even as the house remained closed. According to police, Lalitha got separated from her husband, CL Raju, around five years ago. She, along with her two daughters, resided at Manikeshwari Nagar near Osmania University and moved into a rented two-room house at Boudha Nagar, Warasiguda, three months ago.Lalitha was at home, while Ravali worked for a garment store and Yashwitha worked for an event managing agency, but they stopped working two months ago and were confined to home, said an official, adding that the two girls are not able to recollect details of any relatives. On Friday around 4.30 pm, when the girls stepped out of their house, neighbours inquired with them and directed them to the police.","C Ravali, 25, and C Yashwitha, 22, told the police that their mother, C Lalitha, 45, died on January 23.

""As part of AMD, the patient must also nominate two people to take healthcare decisions on his or her behalf in case they lose their decision-making capacity. This document will come in handy for medical professionals to decide on the kind of medical treatment that the patient may or may not need,"" he explained.","Karnataka has become the first state to allow dignified death for the terminally ill.

Will faith 'trump' uncertainty? 'Visa temples' give hope to H1-B applicants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-faith-trump-uncertainty-visa-temples-give-hope-to-h1-b-applicants/articleshow/117841961.cms,"Ashok Sundar had just struck out '108' on the little chequered sheet standing inside the Chilkur Balaji temple - 20km from Hyderabad's skyscraper-studded Financial District. His beaming face, glossy polyester shirt and bright red vermilion tilak running right up to the hairline meant that the ""visa god"" had smiled upon him. Ashok got his passport stamped with H-1B a day earlier and was at the temple to show his gratitude.He leaves for his new tech job in New Jersey in April.There were many Ashoks in the sea of people chanting 'Govinda, Govinda' as they walked around the deity at the temple, less than a fortnight after Donald Trump took over as the 47th President of the US. Since taking office, Trump has threatened to send back ""millions and millions of criminal aliens"", send troops to the southern border, and has even ordered the revoking of citizenship status for children of temporary visa holders. The announcements have sent a chill down the spine of the immigrant community, both within the US and among those anxious to go there.Indians dreaming of a new life in the US are now clinging to faith in the hope of a miracle - whether it is the Chilkur Balaji temple near Hyderabad, the Chamatkari Hanuman temple at Ahmedabad or the Shree Siddhi Peeth Chamatkari Hanuman Mandir in Delhi. ""Eleven of us had applied last year,"" says Ashok, after completing his 108th pradakshina (circumambulation) of the temple dedicated to an avatar of Vishnu. ""I am the only one who got the visa. It is only because of Lord Balaji,"" adds the IT executive. He had prayed at the temple after submitting his visa papers in June 2024.Ahmedabad's Chamatkari Hanuman temple, also called 'Visa Hanuman', has swelling crowds during the weekend, with just two prayers on their lips. Either it's ""Lord, please grant me a visa"" or it's ""Lord, thank you for the visa."" The 300-year-old temple has earned a ""visa friendly"" reputation, drawing devotees from as far as J&K and Meghalaya.Pujari Vijay Bhatt says a person wishing to get a visa is first asked to place his or her passport before Lord Hanuman and then repeat the Hanuman Chalisa after the pujari. The applicant is also asked to visit any Hanuman temple once a week and repeat the Hanuman Chalisa. ""It's all about one's 'shraddha'. If there is faith, all things are possible. If doubts creep into one's mind, then one is bound to face disappointment,"" says the priest, adding that he has been witness to instances where a visa has been secured within an hour of conducting the ritual, even after three or four visa denials. One such Ahmedabad resident whose US visa has been rejected once, got to know from friends that praying at the Chamatkari Hanuman temple will work wonders. ""I have complete faith that I will be granted a US visa in my next interview,"" he says, before going through the temple rituals.Down a dusty lane filled with hardware shops stands the Shree Siddhi Peeth Chamatkari Hanuman Mandir at Delhi's Neb Sarai. Pandit Narayan Mishra, who has been officiating at the mandir for the last five years, says people give up meat, alcohol, onion and garlic for 41 days in their quest for the elusive visa stamp. ""They write their manokamna (wish) on a piece of paper. We take the slip of paper and make the idol 'read it' and chant the mantras. It is then placed in a box next to the deity,"" Mishra says.But what makes people come from across the country to the temple? ""Perhaps because Hanuman is considered the first god to have travelled outside the country to Lanka without any paperwork,"" he adds with a smile. Folklore or an attempt at humour, people in the area attest to the ""magical powers"" of the shrine. ""People come in a very disturbed state of mind. This is their last resort, and we usually find that their wishes do come true. Just last week, an applicant who got his US visa in only two weeks came to the temple for a puja to thank God,"" shares Mishra.Though Andhra software engineer Chandana C confesses to being crestfallen after Trump's success in the elections, she is now hopeful that her 25 visits to the Hyderabad temple in the last 25 months will not go in vain. ""I have been coming here every month since I applied for the visa through a local consultancy. I know things aren't looking bright right now, but I have faith I will eventually get it,"" says the 26-year-old desperate to realise her American dream, just like all her other relatives did.Not just for themselves, some even go through the ritual motions for their beloved kin. Kaushik R, on his 56th pradakshina, says that he is there to pray for his older brother living in North Carolina. ""I am praying that his name is selected in the lottery process, and he gets his H-1B. If all goes well, I will also join the University of Cincinnati for a MS programme later this year,"" says the freshly-minted engineering graduate - pinning his hopes on his talent and Lord Balaji in equal measure. ""But I will pray for myself later. This is for my brother,"" Kaushik adds, before quickly returning to his place in the queue. Right behind him is Ravindra R, who has landed himself his dream job in Texas. There's just one step for him to clear now: the visa interview. ""When I go for it, I know I will have Lord Balaji's blessings with me. Nothing can stop me,"" the IT professional says.With additional reporting from Meghdoot Sharon in Ahmedabad(Applicants' names changed on request)","Pujari Vijay Bhatt says a person wishing to get a visa is first asked to place his or her passport before Lord Hanuman and then repeat the Hanuman Chalisa.

American President Donald Trump is serious about wanting to buy Greenland, US secretary of state Marco Rubio said on Thursday, after Denmark reacted to his comments about taking over the autonomous Danish territory.In an interview, Rubio said the United States is not considering military action against Denmark, a Nato ally, but confirmed that Trump's interest in Greenland is real.""This is not a joke,"" he said.""President Trump's put out there what he intends to do, which is to purchase it,"" Rubio told SiriusXM Radio.""This is not about acquiring land for the purpose of acquiring land.

Three additional massage therapists are accusing Justin Tucker of inappropriate sexual behavior

Three more massage therapists have come forward accusing Ravens kicker Justin Tucker of sexually inappropriate behavior, including a woman who said he stroked her inner thigh during a massage and left ejaculate on the table. Nine massage therapists from five high-end spas and wellness centers have shared their experiences with The Banner, including an internal report from a former employee of the luxury downtown Baltimore men's spa, The QG.According to The Baltimore Banner, three additional massage therapists are accusing Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker of inappropriate sexual behavior.The latest claims against Tucker come after the Banner's first report on the accusations, which included six women who alleged inappropriate behavior on his part, including repeatedly moving a towel to expose himself.A massage therapist shared an internal report she wrote to The QG, an upscale men's spa, in 2015 after an appointment with Tucker. In the report, the therapist accuses Tucker of exposing himself, as well as running his fingers along her inner thigh.“I understand that Justin Tucker is an important client to The QG, but as an employee of The QG who has tolerated the previous interactions with him, I no longer feel safe or comfortable working with him,” she wrote in the report.The owner of The QG, through an attorney, let the Banner know that he was not aware of any complaints against Tucker. Tucker denies the claims against him, calling them ""desperate tabloid fodder,"" and the NFL and Ravens have confirmed their knowledge of the reporting by the Banner, stating they are ""unequivocally false"" since their first public outcry.According to his lawyers, Tucker said on Twitter that he never acted improperly before, during, or after the professional bodywork treatment session. His lawyers called The Banner's actions ""desperate tabloid fodder.” “I cannot be any clearer,” the statement read. “These accusations are false and incredibly hurtful to both me, and more importantly, my family.”Also Read: “He knew those allegations were coming”: ESPN's Stephen A.

Questions over airspace restrictions and flight procedures

As the investigators continue working to determine the cause of the tragic midair collision between an American Airlines passenger jet and a US Army Black Hawk helicopter near Washington, DC, the preliminary data released by the US national transportation safety board (NTSB) on Saturday showed discrepancies regarding the altitude of the two aircraft at the time of the collision.The incident, which occurred Wednesday night near Ronald Reagan National Airport , killing all 67 people on board both aircraft, is the deadliest aviation accident in the US since 2001.As per the preliminary data, flight recorder of the American Airlines jet indicated an altitude of approximately 325 feet (99 meters), with a possible error margin of 25 feet (7.6 meters). However, air traffic control records suggested that the Black Hawk helicopter was flying at 200 feet (61 meters), raising questions about how the crash occurred.“That’s what our job is, to figure that out,” said NTSB member Todd Inman, who grew visibly frustrated when pressed for more details during a news conference, news agency AP reported.Investigators hope to clarify the altitude differences once they recover data from the helicopter’s black box, which was waterlogged and has taken longer to retrieve. The tower data, which can sometimes be unreliable, is also being refined.The wreckage of both aircraft landed in the Potomac River, where divers and recovery crews have been working since Wednesday night. As of Saturday afternoon, officials had retrieved the remains of 42 victims, 38 of whom had been positively identified.According to Washington emergency officials, the bodies of all passengers are expected to be recovered, though retrieving those trapped in the aircraft fuselage may require pulling the wreckage from the water, AP reported.A Coast Guard cutter with a crane has been stationed at the crash site to assist with recovery efforts. More than 300 responders have been working in the area, with additional Navy salvage barges expected to arrive to help lift heavy wreckage. Washington fire chief John Donnelly Sr. described the work as “heartbreaking” and emotionally taxing for rescue workers.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) imposed strict helicopter traffic restrictions over the Reagan National Airport area following the crash. Military officials have stated that the helicopter crew was highly experienced and familiar with the congested airspace in Washington, where military aircraft often conduct practice flights for emergency evacuation routes.Investigators are reviewing multiple factors, including the actions of the military pilot and air traffic controllers at the time of the accident. As per AP, NTSB is also examining the helicopter’s altitude restrictions and whether the crew was using night vision goggles.US President Donald Trump commented on social media, alleging that the helicopter was flying above the permitted altitude of 200 feet. “It was far above the 200-foot limit. That’s not really too complicated to understand, is it???” he wrote on Truth Social.NTSB officials have interviewed at least one air traffic controller who was on duty during the collision, and more interviews are expected. The FAA’s long-standing staffing shortages among air traffic controllers may also be a factor under review.A full NTSB investigation could take a year to complete, but a preliminary report is expected within 30 days.","Preliminary data released by the US national transportation safety board (NTSB) on Saturday showed discrepancies regarding the altitude of the two aircraft at the time of the collision.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced on Sunday that she had directed her economy minister to introduce tariff and non-tariff measures in response to new US tariffs on Mexican goods.This comes after US President Donald Trump signed an order imposing tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada, and China. The decision has raised concerns about inflation and business disruptions across North America.Both Mexico and Canada have indicated they will respond with countermeasures.Sheinbaum stated in a post on X that Mexico aims for cooperation and dialogue rather than conflict with the US government. Mexico president also called Trump's claim of cartel alliance 'slander'.""We categorically reject the White House’s slander that the Mexican government has alliances with criminal organizations, as well as any intention of meddling in our territory,” Sheinbaum wrote.She also addressed fentanyl trafficking , a key issue in US-Mexico relations.“If the United States government and its agencies wanted to address the serious fentanyl consumption in their country, they could fight the sale of drugs on the streets of their major cities, which they don’t do and the laundering of money that this illegal activity generates that has done so much harm to its population,” she said.Sheinbaum highlighted her government’s efforts since she took office in October, including the seizure of 20 million doses of fentanyl and the detention of over 10,000 individuals linked to drug trafficking.The tariffs have created uncertainty in trade relations between the US, Mexico, and Canada, the three largest economies in North America.","Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced on Sunday that she had directed her economy minister to introduce tariff and non-tariff measures in response to new US tariffs on Mexican goods.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has appointed Maj Gen Eyal Zamir as the next chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), replacing Lt Gen Herzi Halevi , who is set to step down in March.The announcement was made by Netanyahu's office on Saturday, confirming that Zamir will officially assume the role on March 6.Zamir, currently serving as the director general of Israel’s defense ministry, was among the top candidates considered for the position.Along with him, defense minister Israel Katz had shortlisted Maj Gen Amir Baram, the current IDF deputy chief of staff, and Maj Gen Tamir Yadai for the role, according to The Times of Israel.Halevi announced his resignation last month, taking responsibility for the security failures that led to Hamas ’ October 7, 2023, attack, widely regarded as the most severe security breach in Israel’s history.As per The Times of Israel, Halevi had initially intended to step down only after a ceasefire agreement was reached between Israel and Hamas.Following the announcement, Halevi issued a statement congratulating Zamir and assuring a smooth handover of command. ""I have known Eyal for many years, and I am confident that he will lead the IDF forward in the face of the challenges ahead,"" Halevi stated, as quoted by ANI. He also emphasized that the transition process over the coming weeks would be ""professional and high-quality.""Zamir, a seasoned military leader, previously served as the deputy chief of staff of the IDF and has held various command positions within Israel’s armed forces. His appointment comes at a critical time when Israel is dealing with complex security threats, including ongoing hostilities with Hamas in Gaza and heightened tensions with Hezbollah in Lebanon.Meanwhile, the Gaza ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas remains a key issue in Israel’s security landscape. Three Israeli hostages—Yarden Bibas, Ofer Kalderon, and Keith Siegel—were released on Saturday as part of the first phase of the truce. Israeli President Isaac Herzog expressed relief at their return but voiced concerns about the remaining captives.According to AP, the first phase of the ceasefire is expected to last six weeks, with a total of 33 Israeli hostages being freed in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. The agreement also includes the reopening of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, allowing medical evacuations for wounded Palestinians.Israeli and Hamas representatives are scheduled to begin negotiations on the second phase of the ceasefire in Washington on Monday, as confirmed by Netanyahu’s office.The discussions will focus on securing the release of remaining hostages and potentially extending the truce indefinitely. However, if no agreement is reached, the conflict could resume in early March.","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has appointed Maj Gen Eyal Zamir as the next chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces.

What was the misinformation around Joe Ellis?



Who is Jo Ellis?



'Blackhawk took a bizarre flight path'



After President Donald Trump blamed the DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) hiring policies of the Obama and Biden governments for the tragic mid-air collision between a Blackhawk and an American Airlines plane and an army helicopter, rumors spread that one of the pilots of the helicopter was a transgender person -- Jo Ellis. This was to connect Donald Trump's reasoning with the mishap -- until Jo Ellis issued a video claiming that she is indeed a Blackhawk pilot, but is alive and was not flying the ill-fated helicopter.""Interesting morning. This is Jo Ellis. I am a Blackhawk pilot with the Virginia Army National Guard. I understand some people have associated me with the crash in DC and that is false. It is insulting to the families to try to tie this to some kind of political agenda, They don't deserve that. I don't deserve this. And I hope you all know that I am alive and well and this should be sufficient for you all to end all the rumors,"" she said adding a statement that the Department of Defense handles casualty notifications and confirmed that no Virginia National Guard personnel were involved in the Black Hawk collision.Jo Ellis' social media posts were scanned after she was mistakenly identified as one of the pilots. Keen-eyed social media users found out that Ellis wrote many anti-Trump statements. ""Just ONE DAY before piloting the Blackhawk that collided mid-air with a passenger jet over DC, transgender military pilot Joe Ellis appeared on the Michael Smerconish podcast. In the interview, Ellis expressed anger over Trump’s ban on trans service members, calling it a direct threat to a career in the military,"" one social media post claimed asking whether the DC crash was ""another trans terrorist attack"" and whether Ellis crashed into the jet on purpose.""So now we’re learning that the Pilot/Co-Pilot ‘female’ who was on the Blackhawk is actually a transgender who wrote a long letter ONE DAY PRIOR about “Gender dysphoria” and depression,"" another post read.Ellis is a Chief Warrant Officer and Black Hawk helicopter pilot who has served in the Virginia National Guard for 15 years, reports said. She served in combat zones in Iraq, along with other operations overseas. She serves in the military part-time, and also works as an IT engineer in the private sector.Ellis began her gender transitioning in 2023 while serving in the Army and claimed that everyone in her unit was very supportive.Though the investigation is on, prima facie the army helicopter is being blamed for taking a bizarre flight path deviating from its scheduled route and also altitude. President Donald Trump this morning took to Truth Social claiming that the Blackhawk was flying higher than its 200-ft limit. A New York Times report said the helicopter pilot even confirmed seeing the American Airlines plane and the air traffic controller asked the pilot to go behind the plane but it did not follow that.","Jo Ellis, a Blackhawk pilot, issued a statement that she was not there in the army helicopter that crashed in DC.

Bilal Shabbir, Kalat’s deputy commissioner, said the attacks took place in Pidrang, Khazeni and Mangochar Bazaar areas of the town, where militants started conducting snap checks of passenger vehicles passing through town.In the first incident, Shabbir said a van carrying 17 soldiers from Panjgur to Quetta came under attack near the mountainous area of Khazeni, where armed men battled the security forces. He said one soldier of the Frontier Corps (FC), a paramilitary force, was separately killed in clashes with the militants.“The bodies of the slain soldiers were shifted to Quetta,” Shabbir said. “We don’t know how many attackers were killed because they took the bodies of their fighters into the mountains in the dark.”He said three FC personnel were also injured in the attack, adding that militants set a private bank on fire in Mangochar Bazaar.Separatist groups like BLA have long been at the forefront of a low-level insurgency in Balochistan, Pakistan's largest province by area and rich in mineral resources. Separatists claim that Islamabad is abusing the province’s natural wealth while ignoring the local population.In recent months, the BLA has become a major security threat, carrying out large-scale attacks in Balochistan and other parts of Pakistan, targeting Chinese nationals and interests engaged in investment projects, security forces, and ethnic Punjabis they perceive as outsiders in Balochistan.",At least 18 soldiers killed and five injured in Balochistan attacks.

The viral screenshot also had a statement which looked inspired by Kamala Harris. ""404. This page is unburdened by what has been. You have reached a broken link. Please return to the home page or use the navigation above,"" it was written.Unburdened is a favorite catchphrase of Kamal Harris as she used the word many times. Social media users including Donald Trump Jr claimed that it was done by the 'White House digital team'.Social media fake claims tried to pass the screenshot as of the White House, but the screenshot was from Kamala Harris' own website for her presidential election. One social media user said it was a page for the Kamala Harris-Tim Walz campaign which does not exist now. However, it's not clear whether any section of the site is leading to the 404 page or whether it was led by typing '404' in the URL.All eyes are on the former vice president for her next move as she has not announced anything. According to insiders, she never had a plan B as she was certain that she would win the election and is now thinking about her future moves. This is the first time Harris is not in a public role since 2004. She and her husband Doug Emhoff moved to Los Angeles while Emhoff has also taken up a new job as a partner of the legal firm Wilkie Farr &Gallagher LLP.As far as politics is concerned, Kamala Harris has two options: running for California Governor in 2026 and preparing to run again as the president in 2028. For many, the first option is now below her stature as the former VP and she would be preparing to contest in the presidential election again.","Many Republican commentators Friday shared a screenshot of a 404 page on former Vice President Kamala Harris. 404 error means the internet page is not available, and has been removed.

PALM BEACH: President Donald Trump has fired the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , Rohit Chopra , in the latest purge of a Biden administration holdover .Chopra was one of the more important regulators from the previous Democratic administration who was still on the job since Trump took office on Jan. 20.During Trump's first term, the Republican had picked Chopra as a Democrat member of the Federal Trade Commission.Chopra was notified of his firing in an email from the White House, according to a person familiar with the notice who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.Chopra is an ally of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, one of Trump's favorite targets, and the Massachusetts Democrat said in a statement that the agency under Chopra held ""Wall Street accountable for cheating hard-working families"" and prevented ""the de-banking of Americans across the country, including consumers locked out of the financial system due to overdraft fees, religious organizations, and conservatives.""Under the law, Chopra was to serve a five-year term, which meant he could have stayed on as the CFPB director.

The Urge to Purge: Trump and Musk 'drain the swamp',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/the-urge-to-purge-trump-and-musk-drain-the-swamp/articleshow/117834365.cms,"The TOI correspondent from Washington

: A massive purge, the likes of which America has never seen and is often attributed to communist and dictatorial regimes abroad, is underway in Washington DC.Thousands of government officials, including career civil servants who have served for decades across administrations, are being cashiered and marched out of their offices.When they are not resigning, they are being fired and escorted from their offices after their security clearances and access to systems are withdrawn.In some cases, whole agencies -- such as USAID, the foreign aid arm of the US government -- are being shuttered down. Other government department websites are being wiped out. It's a bloodbath without blood -- for now.Depending on one's viewpoint, the perpetrators of the purge, directed by President Trump and executed mainly by Elon Musk, are being seen as revolutionaries freeing Washington DC from the stranglehold of the old order/establishment or bandits ransacking the capital.The face-off played out in a surreal manner on Friday when Musk literally asked for the keys to the treasury to see how government money was being spent, and an unelected bureaucrat who was the gatekeeper resigned rather than submit to Musk, who is also unelected but works under the directive of the President.David Lebryk, the highest ranking official in the Treasury department, announced his retirement on Friday, reportedly after a dispute with Musk’s aides over access to the payment system the U.S. government uses to disburse trillions of dollars every year. Lebryk, a respected bureaucrat with 35 years in the government, held the keys to the Treasury’s Department's payment systems that disburses more than $6 trillion annually to households and businesses, including Social Security and Medicare benefits, salaries for federal personnel, payments to government contractors and grant recipients, and tax refunds.Musk defended his incursion into the government and the way it spent money, which has long been the domain of Congress and its elected lawmakers, saying, ""This is the critical battle to restore power to the PEOPLE from the massive unelected bureaucracy!""""If your elected representatives cannot overcome the bureaucrats who control government, then you live in a BUREAUcracy, not a DEMOcracy!"" he wrote on X. Republican lawmakers were largely silent over their powers being usurped while Democratic lawmakers were apoplectic but seemingly powerless for now.Elsewhere, there is large scale ongoing purge at the Justice Department and FBI, where scores, perhaps hundreds of officials and investigators, associated with probes into Trump, were summarily sacked and escorted out of their offices. David Sundberg, the head of the FBI’s Washington Field Office, and a career FBI agent with more than two decades in the Bureau, was among those fired.In some agencies, officials who resisted termination were physically evicted from their offices. Phyllis Fong, a 22-year old government veteran who was inspector general of the US Department of Agriculture, was among those who was literally turfed out of office on Thursday.President Trump essayed what was virtually a ""good riddance"" to bureaucrats and officials in what he has long seen as a entrenched welfare establishment that has become a ""Deep State"" protecting vested interests.""We'd love to have them leave. We wanna clean it out. People have been trying to reduce the federal government now for 40 years, 45 years, and they haven't been able to do it. And this is a way of doing it very nicely. It's sort of a buyout too.” he said in remarks defending his administration seeking pre-emptive resignations from government employees.","Thousands of government officials, including career civil servants who have served for decades across administrations, are being cashiered and marched out of their offices.

California firefighters have finally gained full control over the devastating Eaton and Palisades wildfires, marking an end to weeks of destruction. State fire officials confirmed on Friday night that both fires, which killed at least 29 people and displaced thousands, are now 100% contained, said Cal Fire, the state's firefighting agency.The Palisades fire tore through over 23,000 acres, destroying more than 6,800 structures, mainly in Pacific Palisades and Malibu.The Eaton fire burned more than 14,000 acres and left over 9,400 buildings in ruins in the Altadena area of Los Angeles County. At least 14 people are still unaccounted for—12 from the Eaton fire and two from the Palisades fire, according to a The New York Times report.Beyond the loss of homes and lives, recovery will be expensive and time-consuming. Experts estimate rebuilding costs could reach hundreds of billions of dollars. The Environmental Protection Agency has started clearing hazardous debris, but the full cleanup will take months.Health concerns also linger. The fires left behind days of toxic smoke, which could have long-term effects on residents. Many have reported breathing problems, and doctors warn of potential complications in the future.Firefighters had struggled to control the blazes for weeks, especially with strong Santa Ana winds spreading the flames. It wasn’t until light rain fell last weekend that they were able to make real progress. While the rain helped, it also triggered minor mudslides in burn areas.Officials are now shifting focus to rebuilding and future preparedness. Kathryn Barger, chair of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, praised firefighters and emergency personnel for their efforts. She stressed the need for better disaster readiness, saying, “The Eaton fire has taught us all that we must remain vigilant and prepare for the unimaginable,” quoted The New York Times.","Eaton and Palisades fires are now 100% contained.

What can the 'black box' tell us about plane crashes?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-can-the-black-box-tell-us-about-plane-crashes/articleshow/117824425.cms,"(AP photo)

What are black boxes?



What does the cockpit voice recorder do?



What are the origins of the black box?



Why the name 'black box'?



It's one of the most important pieces of forensic evidence following a plane crash: The so-called "" black box .""There are actually two of these remarkably sturdy devices: the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder . And they're typically orange, not black.Federal investigators on Friday recovered the black boxes from the passenger jet that crashed in the Potomac River just outside Washington on Wednesday, while authorities were still searching for similar devices in the military helicopter that also went down.One recovered flight data recorder was in good condition and its information is expected to be downloaded shortly. Water had gotten inside the cockpit voice recorder, which will make downloading the data more difficult. The collision killed 67 people in the deadliest US aviation disaster since 2001.Here is an explanation of what black boxes are and what they can do:The cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder are tools that help investigators reconstruct the events that lead up to a plane crash.They're orange in color to make them easier to find in wreckage, sometimes at great ocean depths. They're usually installed a plane's tail section, which is considered the most survivable part of the aircraft, according to the National Transportation Safety Board's website.They're also equipped with beacons that activate when immersed in water and can transmit from depths of 14,000 feet (4,267 meters). While the battery that powers the beacon will run down after about one month, there's no definitive shelf-life for the data itself, NTSB investigators told The Associated Press in 2014.For example, black boxes of an Air France flight that crashed in the Atlantic Ocean in 2009 were found two years later from a depth of more than 10,000 feet, and technicians were able to recover most of the information.If a black box has been submerged in seawater, technicians will keep them submerged in fresh water to wash away the corrosive salt. If water seeps in, the devices must be carefully dried for hours or even days using a vacuum oven to prevent memory chips from cracking.The electronics and memory are checked, and any necessary repairs made. Chips are scrutinized under a microscope.The cockpit voice recorder collects radio transmissions and sounds such as the pilot's voices and engine noises, according to the NTSB's website.Depending on what happened, investigators may pay close attention to the engine noise, stall warnings and other clicks and pops, the NTSB said. And from those sounds, investigators can often determine engine speed and the failure of some systems.Investigators are also listening to conversations between the pilots and crew and communications with air traffic control. Experts make a meticulous transcript of the voice recording, which can take up to a week.What does the flight data recorder do? The flight data recorder monitors a plane's altitude, airspeed and heading, according to the NTSB. Those factors are among at least 88 parameters that newly built planes must monitor.Some can collect the status of more than 1,000 other characteristics, from a wing's flposition to the smoke alarms. The NTSB said it can generate a computer animated video reconstruction of the flight from the information collected.NTBS investigators told the AP in 2014 that a flight data recorder carries 25 hours of information, including prior flights within that time span, which can sometimes provide hints about the cause of a mechanical failure on a later flight. An initial assessment of the data is provided to investigators within 24 hours, but analysis will continue for weeks more.At least two people have been credited with creating devices that record what happens on an airplane.One is French aviation engineer Francois Hussenot. In the 1930s, he found a way to record a plane's speed, altitude and other parameters onto photographic film, according to the website for European plane-maker Airbus.In the 1950s, Australian scientist David Warren came up with the idea for the cockpit voice recorder, according to his 2010 AP obituary.Warren had been investigating the crash of the world's first commercial jet airliner, the Comet, in 1953, and thought it would be helpful for airline accident investigators to have a recording of voices in the cockpit, the Australian Department of Defence said in a statement after his death.Warren designed and constructed a prototype in 1956. But it took several years before officials understood just how valuable the device could be and began installing them in commercial airlines worldwide. Warren's father had been killed in a plane crash in Australia in 1934.Some have suggested that it stems from Hussenot's device because it used film and ""ran continuously in a light-tight box, hence the name 'black box,'"" according to Airbus, which noted that orange was the box's chosen color from the beginning to make it easy to find.Other theories include the boxes turning black when they get charred in a crash, the Smithsonian Magazine wrote in 2019.""The truth is much more mundane,"" the magazine wrote. ""In the post-World War II field of electronic circuitry, black box became the ubiquitous term for a self-contained electronic device whose input and output were more defining than its internal operations.""The media continues to use the term, the magazine wrote, ""because of the sense of mystery it conveys in the aftermath of an air disaster.""","The cockpit voice recorder collects radio transmissions and sounds such as the pilot's voices and engine noises. The flight data recorder monitors a plane's altitude, airspeed and heading, according to the NTSB. They're orange in color to make them easier to find in wreckage, sometimes at great ocean depths.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117824519,imgsize-934005,width-400,resizemode-4/117824519.jpg"

All while graduating from UChicago in three years.""Her statement highlights the irony of the situation: while Winters has been responsible for significant investigative journalism, mainstream media outlets seemed more interested in scrutinizing her wardrobe than her work. She pointed out the influence of the 'War Room' audience, describing it as ""the most powerful in media history,"" and referencing political figures like Kevin McCarthy and Anthony Fauci to emphasize the impact of her reporting.Winters continued: ""It’s very clear that your misinformation attacks FAILED so now you’re pivoting by trying to depict me as some dumb, vapid bimbo. Good luck with that. I know the left loves transgenderism, obesity, and ugly people, but you should pick someone else to attack.""Her unfiltered remarks have sparked further controversy, with critics accusing her of using inflammatory language.

Her appointment garnered attention due to her choice of attire during her initial days in the role, which some critics labeled as unprofessional. Winters addressed the criticism by defending her credibility and suggesting that the focus on her appearance was an attempt to undermine her work as a journalist.Beyond her journalism career, Winters maintains an active presence on social media platforms, where she shares insights into her professional endeavors and personal interests.","Natalie Winters, 23, is an American journalist and producer.

Did Donald Trump 'ban' Black History Month? Here's the truth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-donald-trump-ban-black-history-month-heres-the-truth/articleshow/117750301.cms,"Trump celebrates Black History Month

Social media erupted with claims that President Donald J. Trump had banned Black History Month following a series of viral posts. Users across platforms like X (formerly Twitter), Instagram, and TikTok shared posts expressing outrage and confusion, with some claiming that Trump had eliminated not only Black History Month but also other ""special observances."" Posts from high-profile accounts amplified the narrative, fueling widespread speculation and debate.Comments ranged from disbelief to anger, with many questioning the implications for cultural and historical recognition in the United States. However, these claims are inaccurate. In fact, Trump officially proclaimed February 2025 as National Black History Month, honoring the contributions of Black Americans throughout the nation's history.In his proclamation, Trump emphasized the pivotal role Black leaders have played in shaping the cultural and political landscape of the United States. ""Today, I am very honored to recognize February 2025 as National Black History Month,"" the president stated. He highlighted influential figures such as Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, Thomas Sowell, and Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, acknowledging their lasting impact on America's commitment to equality under the law. Trump also recognized sports icon Tiger Woods for his groundbreaking achievements in the world of athletics.Reflecting on the nation's progress, Trump expressed gratitude to Black Americans for their historical and ongoing contributions. ""This National Black History Month, as America prepares to enter a historic Golden Age, I want to extend my tremendous gratitude to Black Americans for all they have done to bring us to this moment,"" he said, adding that he looks forward to the future achievements of Black Americans under his administration.Despite longstanding accusations of racism from his political opponents, Trump secured significant support from Black voters and other minority groups in the 2024 US presidential election. This shift in voter demographics marked a notable change, reflecting a growing base of diverse supporters who resonated with his policies and leadership approach.Concluding his proclamation, Trump called on public officials, educators, librarians, and citizens across the United States to observe the month with ""appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities"" that honor Black history and culture.The proclamation was signed on January 31, 2025, marking the 249th year of American independence. The social media claims appear to be unfounded, as the proclamation itself stands in clear contradiction to the narrative that Black History Month was banned.","President Donald J.

Eighteen paramilitary personnel were killed and three others seriously wounded in an ambush in southwest Pakistan's Balochistan province, local officials confirmed on Saturday.The attack took place near the town of Mangochar, where a vehicle ""carrying unarmed Frontier Corps personnel"" was intercepted by 70 to 80 heavily armed assailants who had blocked the road, a police official told AFP on condition of anonymity.The gunmen opened fire, killing 17 of the passengers on board. A paramilitary who arrived to assist was also killed in the attack.Three others were critically injured, while two managed to escape unscathed.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack so far, but Balochistan has long been plagued by sectarian, ethnic, and separatist violence.The province, which borders Afghanistan and Iran, has seen a surge in attacks in recent months.In January, six people were killed in a bombing claimed by the separatist Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), which has frequently targeted security forces and civilians, particularly those from other provinces.The BLA has also attacked foreign-funded energy projects, including those backed by China, accusing outsiders of exploiting the province’s vast natural resources while neglecting local communities.In November, the BLA took responsibility for a bombing at Quetta’s main railway station that killed 26 people, including 14 soldiers. Just months earlier, in August, the group launched a series of coordinated attacks that left at least 39 people dead, marking one of the deadliest escalations in recent years.Violence has also surged beyond Balochistan, with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province witnessing an increase in militant attacks.The Pakistani military reported that in 2024 alone, 383 soldiers and 925 militants were killed in various clashes.","18 paramilitary personnel killed in ambush in southwest Pakistan's Balochistan province.

TikTok ban debate in US



A 15-year-old girl was shot dead by her father and maternal uncle in an alleged honour killing in Pakistan 's Quetta , after she refused to stop making TikTok videos , ARY news reported.The victim, identified as Hira, had been active on the social media platform, which enraged her father, Anwarul-Haq . After she refused to comply with his demand to stop creating content, he conspired with her maternal uncle, Tayyab Ali, to kill her, according to police.""Our investigation so far has found that the family had an objection to her dressing, lifestyle, and social gathering,"" another police investigator, Zohaib Mohsin, said. ""We have her phone. It is locked,"" he told Reuters. ""We are probing all aspects, including honour killing.""According to the authorities, Anwarul-Haq had moved to the United States with his wife and children several years ago.However, on January 15, he returned to Pakistan with Hira, while his wife and two other daughters remained in the US Police confirmed that the murder was premeditated, with both men confessing to the crime.The case has now been transferred to the serious crime investigation wing for further inquiry.Meanwhile, TikTok remains unavailable on Apple and Google app stores in the United States. US President Donald Trump has expressed support for approving the app, provided that the US owns 50% of it.""We need to save TikTok because we have to save a lot of jobs. We don't want to give our business to China... I agreed to approve TikTok on the condition that the USA will own 50 per cent of TikTok,"" Trump said.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has also weighed in on the debate, opposing a TikTok ban while specifying what he called an imbalance in global platform regulations.""I have been against a TikTok ban for a long time, because it goes against freedom of speech . That said, the current situation where TikTok is allowed to operate in America, but X is not allowed to operate in China is unbalanced. Something needs to change,"" Musk posted on X.On April 19, Musk reiterated his stance, saying, ""In my opinion, TikTok should not be banned in the USA, even though such a ban may benefit the X platform. Doing so would be contrary to freedom of speech and expression. It is not what America stands for.""","15-year-old girl was shot dead by her father and maternal uncle in an alleged honour killing in Pakistan's Quetta.

Baloch leader calls for solidarity against Pakistan's brutal oppression,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/baloch-leader-calls-for-solidarity-against-pakistans-brutal-oppression/articleshow/117628431.cms,"<p>Baloch leader Hyrbyair Marri (Image credits: ANI)<br></p>

LONDON: Baloch leader Hyrbyair Marri brought attention to the ongoing horrors that the Pashtun and Baloch communities endure under Pakistan 's repressive control in a stirring statement to the Pashtun National Council (Jirga). Marri brought attention to the Pakiststate's systematic exploitation, enforced disappearances, and violence against various ethnic communities.""The sufferings of the Baloch and Pashtun under Pakistan's occupation are countless and unending,"" Marri stated, emphasizing the urgent need for unity between the two nations to resist colonial oppression.He recalled previous instances of solidarity, such as the treaty of kalat in 1758, in which Afghan and Baloch leaders promised to respect and support one another. He asked both groups to rekindle this spirit in their struggle for independence.Marri compared British imperialism to the colonial strategies that Pakistan acquired. He denounced Pakistan's continuous military actions in Balochistan , pointing to unlawful executions, torture, and enforced disappearances as means of quelling dissent. The Baloch leader cited the targeted profiling of Pashtuns and killings like the 1948 Barbra event in Charsadda, claiming that these practices were continuations of the British heritage of divide and conquer.Recalling how Pashtun tribes were utilized as frontline combatants in 1948 while Punjabi elites remained behind, he also denounced Pakistan's abuse of Baloch and Pashtun youth. He also drew attention to the fact that thousands of Baloch youths were forcibly drafted into the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s and sent to die under pretences of religious salvation.Marri condemned Pakistan's racial profiling of Afghan refugees, primarily Pashtuns, and their forced deportation as a pressure tactic against Afghanistan. ""These people have lived here for generations, yet they are treated as disposable,"" he said.Calling for a renewed alliance between the Baloch and Pashtun nations, Marri declared, ""Our unity is the path to freedom. Together, we will break the chains of occupation and build a future rooted in justice, sovereignty, and peace.""","Baloch leader Hyrbyair Marri spoke to the Pashtun National Council (Jirga) Marri condemned Pakistan's systematic exploitation, enforced disappearances, and violence against various ethnic communities.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan criminalised online disinformation on Tuesday, passing legislation that enshrines punishments of up to three years in prison, a decision journalists say is designed to crack down on dissent.The law targets anyone who ""intentionally disseminates"" information online that they have ""reason to believe to be false or fake and likely to cause or create a sense of fear, panic or disorder or unrest"".The law was rushed through the national assembly with little warning last week before being approved by the senate on Tuesday as journalists walked out of the gallery in protest.Senior journalist Asif Bashir Chaudhry, a member of the Pakistan federal union of journalists , told AFP the government had assured reporters they would be consulted but said they were ""betrayed and backstabbed"".""We genuinely wanted a law against misinformation, but if it's not being done through open discussion but rather through fear and coercion, we will challenge it on every available platform,"" Chaudhry said.""Even under dictatorships, legislation was not forcefully rammed through parliament the way this government is doing now.""The bill will now be passed to the president to be rubber-stamped.Analysts say the government is struggling with legitimacy after an election plagued with rigging allegations and with Pakistan's most popular politician, former prime minister Imran Khan , in jail on a slew of corruption charges his party says are politically motivated.Khan's supporters and senior leaders have also faced a severe crackdown, with thousands rounded up.Social media site X has been shut down in the wake of elections last February, as posts alleging vote tampering spread on the platform.Khan's name is censored from television and editors have reported increasing monitoring of their programming.Senator Syed Shibli Faraz, a member of Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, called the new law ""highly undemocratic"" and said it would ""fuel the political victimisation"" of their activists.However, government minister Tanveer Hussain said that the bill would focus on policing social media.""I am sure that in the future, the anarchy caused in society through social media will be controlled,"" he said.There has been a proliferation of ""disinformation"" laws, including criminal legislation, worldwide in the past decade enabling governments to control speech online and police ""fake news"", according to human rights organisation Article 19 .Such laws can impede journalism, according to the group, which promotes freedom of expression and information globally.","Law targets anyone who ""intentionally disseminates"" information online that they have ""reason to believe to be false or fake"" Law rushed through national assembly with little warning before being approved by the senate.
