Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid’s statement that Pakistan spy agency ISI had planned attacks in Kerman in Iran and Moscow’s Crocus City Hall in 2024 has validated the findings by Indian intelligence agencies that ISI and the Pakistan military were running IS-Khorasan modules from Af-Pak border areas.The two attacks, which happened in a span of three months, were claimed by the IS in Khorasan Province. Iran’s probe had revealed that the main accused Abdollah Tajiki had entered Iran two weeks before the attack by crossing the southeast border (that is Pakistan).US had called the attack in Moscow as “IS-K’s first successful attack in Russia”, though Moscow had accused “the special services of an unfriendly state” for the blast — seen as a reference to Ukraine.“Both operations — originally claimed by the Islamic State — were coordinated on Pakistani soil and IS-K’s leadership is based in Pakistan,” Mujahid claimed during a press briefing on Oct 12. The Taliban administration’s spokesman also implicated the ISI in fomenting unrest in Afghanistan, alleging that certain elements within Pakistan’s military establishment were averse to peace in the region.The Taliban’s claims corroborates the assessment of the Indian agencies that IS-K’s recruiters brainwashing Indian youths were actually being controlled by ISI. Several IS-inspired modules busted in Delhi, Ranchi and other places were being handled by ISI operatives with the internet protocol analysis pointing to locations deep inside Pakistan. “A particular group within the Pakistani army is turning a blind eye to IS activities,” Mujahid alleged. He accused Pakistan of allowing IS-K to operate from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, planning attacks on Afghan soil.","Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said Pakistan spy agency ISI had planned attacks in Kerman in Iran and Moscow’s Crocus City Hall in 2024.

New Delhi: Refuting allegations made by activist Sonam Wangchuk ’s wife against his detention under National Security Act, the Ladakh administration told Supreme Court that due process of law was followed, including informing him about grounds of arrest, and he was also allowed to meet his relatives in jail. It also informed the court that he was not being kept in solitary detention as alleged, and was medically fit.In an affidavit filed in SC, Leh district magistrate Romil Singh Donk said Wangchuk was getting legal assistance and advice in jail in preparing his representation before the advisory board against his detention.“At the outset, the answering respondent denies the baseless allegations made in the petition which suggest that Sonam Wangchuk has been detained illegally and that he is being treated improperly in the course of such detention. In this regard, it is submitted that he has been lawfully detained under a lawful authority by way of an order under Section 3(2) of NSA,” the affidavit said.“The order of detention came to be passed by me (DM) after duly considering the material placed before me, as mandated under law, and after arriving at a subjective satisfaction on the circumstances that prevailed within the local limits of the jurisdiction where he had been indulging in activities prejudicial to the security of the State, maintenance of public order and services essential to the community as mentioned in the grounds of detention,” it said.He said that the activist was “categorically informed both of the factum of his detention under the Act as well as the factum of his transfer to the Jodhpur central jail.

NEW DELHI: A 31-member committee formed in the Haryana IPS officer Y Puran Kumar's alleged suicide case suicide, on Sunday, gave the Chandigarh administration and Haryana government 48 hours to remove state police chief Shatrujeet Kapur.Kapur is among the officers named by Kumar’s wife, IAS officer Amneet P Kumar, for allegedly abetting her husband’s suicide.The committee made this demand during a mahapanchayat in Chandigarh on Sunday. Heavy police were deployed around the venue.“The Haryana DGP and former Rohtak SP should be arrested. The DGP must be removed from his post. We have given 48 hours, after which we will decide the next course of action,” a committee spokesperson told reporters, as quoted by news agency PTI.Six days have passed since Kumar, who was last posted as IG at the Police Training Centre in Rohtak’s Sunaria, died. His post-mortem and cremation have not been conducted, as the family is refusing consent until their demands are met.The mahapanchayat saw tension when former Haryana MP Raj Kumar Saini reportedly made a controversial remark, sparking anger among attendees. Calm was restored after organisers intervened.A message from Kumar’s family was read, appealing for support in their pursuit of justice. Committee members also demanded a judicial probe into the case, said Gurmail Singh, a committee member. “The family and dalit community fear that if the last rites are conducted, the government may not take action against the accused,” said Karamvir, a committee member. He also questioned the work done by the Special Investigation Team set up by Chandigarh police.Fifty-two-year-old Kumar, a 2001-batch IPS officer, allegedly shot himself at his Chandigarh home on October 7. In an eight-page note reportedly left behind, he named eight senior officers, including DGP Kapur and former Rohtak SP Narendra Bijarniya, accusing them of harassment and tarnishing his image. The note also mentioned caste-based discrimination.The Haryana government has transferred Bijarniya, replacing him with IPS officer Surinder Singh Bhoria.In her complaint to Chandigarh Police, Amneet P Kumar sought an FIR against Kapur and Bijarniya under Section 108 (abetment of suicide) and relevant provisions of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, demanding their arrest. She also requested amendments to the FIR to include all accused officers’ names.Haryana ministers and senior officials, including chief secretary Anurag Rastogi, recently met the family to persuade them to agree to the post-mortem and cremation.","A 31-member committee formed in the Haryana IPS officer Y Puran Kumar's alleged suicide case suicide, on Sunday, gave the Chandigarh administration 48 hours to remove state police chief Shatrujeet Kapur.

He cited Beijing’s export restrictions on rare earth minerals, which are used in smartphones, electric vehicles, and military hardware.The new US tariffs, along with export controls on ""any and all critical software,"" are set to take effect from November 1. Trump described Beijing’s actions as ""extraordinarily aggressive"" and said, ""There is no way that China should be allowed to hold the World 'captive'.""Currently, Chinese goods face 30% US tariffs, while Beijing’s retaliatory duties stand at 10%.The announcement sent Wall Street into a tailspin, with the Nasdaq dropping more than three percent.Investors were already cautious after a recent surge in tech stocks had raised fears of a market bubble.The latest tensions came after months of fragile peace between the two economic giants, who had been negotiating a full trade deal following Trump’s tariff announcements in April.

NEW DELHI: Keeping up the attack on the veracity of Sunjay Kapur’s will, his children from actor Karisma Kapoor told the Delhi high court on Tuesday that the document uses a “feminine pronoun” to describe him.The counsel appearing for Samaira and Kiaan Raj made the submission before Justice Jyoti Singh during the hearing of their plea challenging their father’s purported will regarding his assets, reportedly worth Rs 30,000 crore.Senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani said a fundamental question is if the will was signed by Sunjay or by a woman in the declaration clause.“The author of the clause could not have been Sunjay Kapur. Clauses in question are not the handiwork or the design of the testator Sunjay Kapur. The female form of testator is used... Testator is now a ‘she’. This is an absurdity. It shows the audacity which people have to present something like this in court. In short, Sunjay Kapur signed this will as a woman?” he said. The only explanation is that it was drafted by a woman, he said.“Unless Sunjay, with an unsound mind incapable of reading... (He) could have never signed this. It is replete with feminine pronouns. It says her last will, her witness, and her presence. The feminine pronoun is used in the most crucial parts to describe him. When you get ‘she’ and ‘her’ in four places, it is incredulous that Sunjay, with all his knowledge, could have drafted this,” the counsel said.He highlighted that the children’s stepmother, Priya Kapur, who is the beneficiary, is silent on who prepared the will. “What is so secretive about it that you don’t want to give it to the beneficiaries? Our case is very clear, that this is not the testator’s will, here we have a fundamental question if the will was signed by the testator or by a woman in the declaration clause,” he added, also questioning why the will was not registered.“If Sunjay Kapur really intended to bequeath all personal assets solely to his wife, what would a man do? He would have registered the will so no one can contest it. But it is not registered,” he said.HC will resume hearing the matter on Wednesday. Last month it had asked Priya Kapur to to give a list of his assets to the court.","Samaira and Kiaan Raj made the submission before Justice Jyoti Singh.

NEW DELHI: Since the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) announced its seat-sharing for the upcoming Bihar elections, the regional party alliances seem to be sending mixed signals.While Lok Janshakti Party's (LJP) Chirag Paswan and Rashtriya Lok Morcha's Upendra Kushwaha said all is well, hinting at a smooth alliance, Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) Jitan Ram Manjhi’s latest post raised a few eyebrows again, after he said that the seat-sharing had ""weakened"" the morale of the workers.The mood swings began over NDA's seat-sharing arrangement which gave LJP(RV) 29 seats, HAM and RLM on six seats each. Meanwhile, BJP JD(U) got an equal share of 101 seats each.However, leaders of Bihar’s ruling NDA said that seat-sharing arrangements within the coalition have been amicably resolved, with discussions on which party will contest specific seats now entering the final stages.HAM chief Manjhi has not shied away from expressing his dissatisfaction repeatedly, with recently saying that the seat-sharing had ""weakened"" the morale of the workers and left them with ""deep dissatisfaction.""""It is true that we have secured fewer seats, the morale of our workers is weakened, and there is deep dissatisfaction among the workers, which I can only assure them will be compensated for in the future,"" he said in a post on X on Tuesday.However, he expressed confidence in NDA's victory in Bihar saying: But this does not mean that we should push Bihar towards lawlessness.

‘Country will be free of Naxalism by 2026,’ Amit Shah, calls on Maoists to give up arms

NEW DELHI: The surrender by CPI(Maoist) politburo member Mallojula Venugopal alias Sonu along with senior and mid-level cadres is being seen as a sign of a vertical split in the Naxal outfit already grappling with an erosion in its leadership and armed strength as well as a rapidly-shrinking arc of influence.The split was evident when Sonu took the initiative to announce on behalf of the CPI(Maoist) central committee, a willingness of armed cadres to lay down weapons and explore the prospects of peace talks with the Centre; only to be disowned by the Telangana state committee, central committee and a section of Dandkarenya special zonal committee (DKSZC).In statements issued subsequently, the latter labelled Sonu’s view in favour of a temporary ceasefire and peace talks as his “individual opinion’ and not the collective view of the CPI(Maoist) leadership. They even described him as a traitor who was not authorised by the outfit to issue a statement under the generic nom de guerre ‘Abhay’ used by its spokesperson.A senior Chhattisgarh govt official told TOI, “The split in Maoist ranks became obvious when the north and west sub-zonal bureau of DKSZC supported Sonu’s stand on denouncing violent extremism and joining the mainstream. However, the south sub-zonal bureau of DKSZC and Telangana state committee opposed it; the main leaders in this camp are Thippiri Tirupathi alias Dev ji, believed to have stepped in as CPI (Maoist) general secretary following the neutralisation of Nambala Keshava Rao alias Basavaraju earlier this year, Chandranna and Hidma etc.The stand of Odisha state committee and Jharkhand faction is not clear on this issue, though”.The fissures in CPI(Maoist) top leadership —also fuelled by an apparent succession tussle between Devji and Sonu — may have come at an opportune time for the anti-Naxal forces as they move closer to the target of eliminating armed Left-wing extremism (LWE) from the country by March 31, 2026. Following Sonu’s surrender, the politburo’s strength is down to just three — comprising general secy Dev ji, his aged predecessor Muppalla Laxman Rao alias Ganpathy and Misir Besra, a rare Jharkhand representative in the CPI(Maoist) apex body where the Telugu-speaking ideologues have always held sway.“The end of violent Naxalism is near. The intensified counter-operations by Chhattisgarh police and the Central forces in the core Naxal area across Abujmarh region have jolted the Maoist leadership and cadres, leaving them with only two options — surrender and join the mainstream or face elimination,” Chhattisgarh chief minister Vishnu Deo Sai told TOI on Tuesday.The surrender by Sonu, which follows months after his sister in law and central committee member Sujata joined the mainstream, also shows that pragmatism may be replacing ideological affinity.Home minister Amit Shah has already ruled out any ceasefire with the Maoists.","The surrender by CPI(Maoist) politburo member Mallojula Venugopal alias Sonu along with senior and mid-level cadres is being seen as a sign of a vertical split in the Naxal outfit. The split was evident when Sonu took the initiative to announce a willingness of armed cadres to lay down weapons and explore the prospects of peace talks with the Centre. The Telangana state committee, central committee and a section of Dandkarenya special zonal committee (DKSZC) disowned him.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124558197,imgsize-21608,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-9.jpg"

Poll Do you feel that government job opportunities are now more accessible to youth from ordinary families? Yes, very much so No, not really

DEHRADUN: Chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami on Tuesday said 26,500 youth have secured government jobs in Uttarakhand over the past four years, which is more than double the total under previous administrations.Dhami made the remarks while distributing appointment letters to 1,456 newly selected candidates, including 109 review officers and assistant review officers selected through the State Public Service Commission, and 1,347 assistant teachers (LT) selected through the Uttarakhand Subordinate Services Selection Commission.He said that during earlier regimes, recruitment processes were riddled with corruption, rigging and bribery, and the cheating mafia flourished.Strict anti-cheating laws brought in by his government have made the system transparent, enabling deserving candidates to secure multiple posts on merit, he said.""These are not just statistics; they are direct evidence. The number of jobs we have given in four years is more than double the total provided by previous governments since the state's creation,"" Dhami said.He claimed the opposition is not happy because children of ordinary families are now securing government jobs purely on merit.""Some of our opposition colleagues are quick to criticise us on every issue. They create false debates because they have no truth to tell. There is no issue at all,"" he said.Dhami also referred to a recent incident in Haridwar, where a candidate allegedly sent 12 questions to his sister through a mobile phone from an exam centre, saying it was wrongly portrayed as a paper leak to mislead the youth.After he agreed to a CBI probe on students' demand, the same people accused him of giving in, he said.The chief minister reaffirmed that his government is committed to protecting the future of the youth and will not allow any conspiracy to succeed.Last month, three pages of a question paper were leaked during the Uttarakhand Subordinate Services Selection Commission's graduate-level exam, sparking protests. The exam was later cancelled and a CBI probe ordered.","Chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said 26,500 youth have secured government jobs in Uttarakhand over the past four years.

NEW DELHI: With US President Donald Trump calling Pakistani general Asim Munir “my favourite Field Marshal” at a summit of world leaders in Egypt, Congress on Tuesday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to clarify what kind of friendship he shares with the American leader who lauds a Pakistani, one who is a “killer of Indians”.The party demanded that PM Modi clear the air on Trump’s objectionable remarks.Congress MP Manickam Tagore said Munir has overseen terror plots and cross-border attacks against India.“Under Modi’s watch, the world is not standing with India, it’s now praising those who target India. This is not diplomacy, this is disaster.”AICC spokesman Jairam Ramesh said Trump and PM Modi call each other “good friends”, but their friendship is strange considering Trump had hosted Munir for lunch at the White House in June and then met him again in September.“This was the Field Marshal whose inflammatory and communally poisonous remarks provided the backdrop to the Pahalgam terror attacks orchestrated by Pakistan on April 22, 2025. Now in Egypt, Trump called Munir 'my favourite Field Marshal' and gave a special place to the PM of Pakistan. What kind of signal is President Trump sending to India, in spite of Modi's desperate attempts to ingratiate himself with the US President?” he asked.Tagore said, “Where is the ‘strong leader’ who claimed he would isolate Pakistan internationally? When India’s enemies are being endorsed and our PM remains silent, it’s clear that Modi’s foreign policy has collapsed.”","US President Donald Trump called Pakistani general Asim Munir “my favourite Field Marshal” at a summit of world leaders in Egypt.

What are the charges?









Indian-origin US expert, Ashley Tellis, who has been an advisor to US government for more than two decades, was arrested on charges of unlawfully retaining classified information and allegedly meeting with Chinese officials.Tellis was found to have kept over 1,000 pages of top-secret or secret documents in his home, the affidavit stated.In April 2023, Tellis attended a dinner with Chinese government officials in a Washington DC suburb and “could be occasionally overheard talking about Iranian-Chinese relations and emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence,” the affidavit noted.According to the affidavit, Tellis serves as an unpaid adviser at the State Department and is a contractor with the Office of Net Assessment (ONA). ONA is the Pentagon’s in-house think tank for anticipating security threats, which the Defence Department announced in March would be dismantled and “restructured.”Tellis reportedly met multiple times with Chinese government officials at a restaurant in the Washington suburb of Fairfax, Virginia. According to the FBI affidavit, cited by AFP, at one dinner he arrived carrying a manila envelope, which he did not appear to take back with him.On two other occasions, the Chinese officials reportedly presented him with gift bags.Lindsey Halligan, US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, announced that Tellis was charged by criminal complaint with the unlawful retention of national defense information, in violation of 18 USC § 793(e).“We are fully focused on protecting the American people from all threats, foreign and domestic. The charges as alleged in this case represent a grave risk to the safety and security of our citizens,” said US Attorney Halligan.“The facts and the law in this case are clear, and we will continue following them to ensure that justice is served.”If convicted, Tellis is subject to a maximum of ten years’ imprisonment, up to a $250,000 fine, a $100 special assessment and forfeiture. Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. A federal district judge will determine any sentence after considering the US Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.","Ashley Tellis, a scholar and expert, is being probed in the US for alleged link with China.

Rapid health decline and fatal complications following cosmetic procedure



Legal battle and allegations raise concerns over cosmetic procedure oversight







Brazilian social media influencer Adair Mendes Dutra Junior, widely known as Junior Dutra, has died at the age of 31 following severe, unexpected complications from a cosmetic procedure. Known for his vibrant social media presence, creative lifestyle content, and engaging personality, Junior had gained a large, loyal following on Instagram. His untimely death has sent shockwaves through the Brazilian beauty community, social media circles, and among his over 100,000 devoted followers, many of whom expressed grief, disbelief, and heartbreak across multiple platforms.The tragedy unfolded after he underwent a popular cosmetic procedure called the “fox eyes” surgery, which aims to lift, reshape, and elongate the outer corners of the eyes for a more striking, model-like appearance. What was intended as a simple beauty enhancement turned fatal, tragically highlighting the potential risks, hidden dangers, and lack of regulation surrounding trendy cosmetic procedures increasingly sought after by influencers worldwide.Junior Dutra reportedly underwent the fox eyes procedure in March, performed by celebrity dentist Fernando Simionato Garbi. The influencer had publicly shared videos documenting the procedure, later revealing significant swelling, bruising, and redness around his eyes.Following the treatment, Junior developed a serious infection, which persisted despite dermatological care. In an interview with Brazilian outlet Feed TV, just a month before his death, he shared his deteriorating health: “I didn’t expect it to get this bad.” He described frequent hospital visits as he struggled to recover from post-procedure complications.This situation underscores a critical point: even procedures that appear minimally invasive or cosmetic can carry severe health risks if complications arise.The fox eyes or cat eyes surgery has surged in popularity in recent years, inspired by celebrities like Bella Hadid and Kendall Jenner. The procedure is designed to create an almond-shaped, lifted eye by raising the outer corners, giving a youthful and striking appearance.According to the American Board of Cosmetic Surgery (ABCS), several methods can achieve this look, including:Despite their popularity, these treatments are not risk-free. The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) warns that complications can include:The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also cautioned against the use of PDO threads for eyebrow or eyelid lifts, noting potential for permanent disfigurement, severe swelling, and long-lasting pain.Medical experts emphasise the importance of monitoring for early warning signs of complications. Post-procedure symptoms that should not be ignored include:To minimise risks, specialists recommend:Junior Dutra’s health reportedly worsened rapidly in his final days. His close friend Gean Souza told Brazilian magazine Quem that he began experiencing shortness of breath and extreme weakness. As reported by The US Sun, on October 3, Junior was rushed to a public hospital in São Paulo after severe respiratory distress. Despite emergency care, he could not be saved. His sudden passing left fans and the online beauty community in shock, illustrating how quickly post-procedure complications can escalate.Adding further complexity to the tragedy, Junior had filed a police complaint prior to his death. Legal documents obtained by Brazilian outlet Portland Leo Dias reveal that Junior accused Garbi of performing medical procedures outside his professional license and impersonating a doctor. The complaint included charges of illegal medical practice, fraud, and causing serious bodily harm. Junior had also requested an official investigation by the 15th Police District of São Paulo.Garbi, through legal representatives, denied any wrongdoing and maintained that his procedures were performed legally and safely under proper supervision. The case highlights the need for stronger regulatory oversight in cosmetic procedures, particularly those fueled by social media trends.","Brazilian social media influencer Adair Mendes Dutra Junior, widely known as Junior Dutra, has died at the age of 31 following severe, unexpected complications from a cosmetic procedure.

Jaisalmer Bus Fire: 20 Killed, 15 Injured After Jodhpur-Bound Bus Catches Fire on Rajasthan Highway

JAISALMER: Twenty people, including three children, died and 15 were critically injured when a bus travelling from Jaisalmer to Jodhpur caught fire on Tuesday afternoon near Thaiyat village, 10km outside Jaisalmer city. A likely short circuit in the bus' air-conditioning, which triggered a gas leak, is believed to be the cause of the inferno, Pokhran MLA Pratap Puri told reporters Tuesday evening.While 19 bodies were retrieved from inside the bus after it caught fire outside the Jaisalmer Army station, 16 passengers who were critically injured were given first aid at Jawahar Hospital in Jaisalmer and then shifted to Jodhpur for treatment. One of the 16 critically injured, Hussain Khan (75), died during treatment in Jodhpur. While six of the deceased belonged to Jodhpur, the rest were from Jaisalmer.The Army Battle Axe Division was the first to respond to the accident and reached the spot immediately after the bus caught fire. The rescue operations were led by General Officer Commanding Battle Axe division, Major General Ashish Khurana, and his team, along with police and local villagers.Though military officials and the police were able to douse the fire, Jaisalmer collector Pratap Singh said rescue operations could not begin until four hours later as the body of the vehicle remained hot, delaying the removal of bodies trapped inside the burnt bus. The remains of the bus were moved to the Army station.Since a war exercise is under way in Jaisalmer, Army vehicles were not available to transport the bodies of the deceased to Jodhpur, officials said. A BSF vehicle was summoned to take the bodies, most of them burnt beyond recognition, to Jodhpur for forensic analysis and DNA sampling for identification.Till the time of going to press, the local administration could only identify the bodies of Rajendra Singh Chauhan, Hasina, Irfan, Barkat Khan, Gopilal, Ayub Khan, and Nasira.President Droupadi Murmu, Vice-President CP Radhakrishnan and Prime Minister Narendra Modi condoled the deceased.""The news of the deaths of several people due to a fire in a bus in Jaisalmer is extremely heartbreaking.

BENGALURU: A major traffic jam stretching for several kilometres brought Outer Ring Road (ORR) to a standstill Tuesday evening after a BMTC electric bus broke down near Ecospace junction.The jam was so severe that motorists took nearly two hours to cover a distance of 12km. The breakdown, which occurred around 4.30pm, led to a cascading traffic jam affecting key stretches between Marathahalli, Kadubeesanahalli, Devarabisanahalli and Bellandur — the heart of the city's IT corridor.Traffic police confirmed the incident through an advisory posted on X at 4.43pm: ""Due to vehicle breakdown near the Ecospace junction towards Marathahalli, Kadubeesanahalli, Devarabisanahalli, Bellandur is having slow-moving traffic.""Officers were deployed on the spot to push the bus aside and restore vehicular movement. A senior police officer said the bus broke down right in the middle of the road, choking the carriageway. ""Traffic movement in Bellandur direction got affected. Police pushed the bus to the side and cleared the road. Since it is a busy stretch, vehicles were moving at a snail's pace for almost an hour,"" he said.The gridlock, however, persisted for several hours, with commuters reporting travel times of nearly two hours to cover less than 10km.""Pathetic traffic… it took 2 hours 10 minutes from Brookfield to Sarjapur Road, just 12km,"" one user wrote on X.Another added: ""One bus stopped on a road made the whole of Bengaluru cry for hours.""

The situation was worsened by the ongoing Metro construction and partial road closures announced by BMRCL last week between 9th Main Road Junction and 5th Main Road Junction — a 45-day closure that has narrowed road space. ORR, home to several major tech parks and offices, remains one of Bengaluru's most traffic-prone stretches.

JD Vance vs. George Stephanopoulos





US President Donald Trump on Tuesday (local time) mocked ABC News host George Stephanopoulos, calling him “Slopadopoulos” during a meeting with Argentine leader Javier Milei at the White House. The jibe was over a recent interview Stephanopoulos conducted with Vice President JD Vance.“We'll take a couple of questions from the news, and I'm sure they'll be incredibly non-hostile, and friendly, like JD went through a very ‘friendly’ interview with George Slopadopoulos,” Trump said, according to Fox News , in apparent sarcasm aimed at Stephanopoulos’ name.Trump continued: “JD had a very nasty person interviewing him, and we can't let that happen. Just is inappropriate to cut off a highly respected vice president of the United States, mid-sentence. I guess it's one way to win an argument. That was the only way he was gonna win the argument.”He also referenced a previous ABC lawsuit , joking, “He (Stephanopoulos) was nice enough to pay me $16 million the last time we came — he had to pay $16 million to me. Which is good. It was worth it. It was worth having somebody lie. If you get $16 million, that's good.”The Republican later declared he would not take questions from “ABC fake news.”The trigger for Trump's remarks was the October 12 interview of Vance by Stephanopoulos. During the interview, Vance defended White House “border czar” Tom Homan, accused of accepting a bribe , while the host pressed him repeatedly on whether Homan had indeed accepted money, citing an alleged FBI surveillance tape.“I don’t know what tape you’re referring to, George. I saw media reports that Tom Homan accepted a bribe. There’s no evidence of that. And here's why fewer and fewer people watch your program and why you're losing credibility,” Vance responded.When Vance suggested moving to a different topic, Stephanopoulos abruptly ended the interview. The vice president later criticised the host on social media:“Peace in the Middle East? China threatening critical supply chains? Government shutdown? George S doesn’t care about that. He’s here to focus on the real story: a fake scandal involving Tom Homan.”","US President Donald Trump mocked ABC News host George Stephanopoulos, calling him ""Slopadopoulos"" The jibe was over a recent interview Stephanopoulos conducted with Vice President JD Vance.

Maharashtra: CET Cell flags 152 MBBS aspirants for 'incorrect or inauthentic' documents; begins verification amid 'seat-blocking' scandal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/maharashtra-cet-cell-flags-152-mbbs-aspirants-for-incorrect-or-inauthentic-documents-begins-verification-amid-seat-blocking-scandal/articleshow/124566640.cms,"Maharashtra's CET Cell is conducting unprecedented document verification for MBBS aspirants after a TOI investigation revealed irregularities





MUMBAI: In an unprecedented step, Maharashtra’s CET Cell has carried out a preliminary verification to check the authenticity of documents uploaded by MBBS aspirants in the third round of admissions—an exercise it never attempted before. Notices have been issued to 152 students whose certificates appear “incorrect or inauthentic,” the CET cell said on Tuesday.The move came a day after a TOI investigation revealed that candidates already holding seats in reputed medical colleges elsewhere had surfaced again in Maharashtra’s merit lists.The fallout was swift. Some students approached the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay High Court, which held its first hearing on Tuesday. The CET Cell, represented in court, sought time until October 16 to conduct a full scrutiny. “We have also been asked to identify more such cases,” said Harpalsingh Sethi, an education counsellor.According to the CET Cell, the flagged candidates have been emailed notices instructing them to re-upload their original and authentic documents by noon on October 16, failing which they will be excluded from the ongoing admission round.""Their domicile certificates do not match the format followilwd by the Maharashtra state govt. In some cases, their class X certificate numbers also look incorrect,"" said a source.""It has been observed that several out-of-Maharashtra candidates have registered for Maharashtra State Counselling by submitting, prima facie false information and documents. Accordingly, this office has taken cognizance and decided to verify documents of all the candidates registered for CAP-3,"" said a notice by the state CET cell.Education experts say this marks a long-overdue attempt to crack down on “seat-blocking” and iillegal admissions a practice in which agents use credentials of high-scoring students from other states to claim Maharashtra seats. These students never join, leaving seats vacant and eventually available for private sale. Or some join these colleges by submitting forged documents.The effect, officials admit, is corrosive: each fake entry delays counselling and shuts out genuine aspirants. A former Directorate of Medical Education and Research officer said such ghost candidates “keep reappearing in lists, creating artificial vacancies or illegal admissions.”Currently, 139 seats in government colleges and nearly 600 in private institutes remain unclaimed—including 112 of 150 at Vedanta Medical College, Palghar—an indictment of how systemic gaps still allow manipulation in medical admissions.","Notices have been issued to 152 students whose certificates appear “incorrect or inauthentic,’ the CET cell said on Tuesday.

Clashes between neighbours Pakistan and Afghanistan continue, with fresh reports emerging early Wednesday from a remote northwestern region in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. State-run media in Pakistan accused Afghan troops of opening “unprovoked firing” that was repulsed.Pakistani forces responded, reportedly damaging Afghan tanks and military posts, according to Pakistan TV and two security officials who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.“Afghan Taliban and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan opened unprovoked fire in Kurram. Pakistani Army responded with full force and intensity,” reported state broadcaster PTV News, quoting security sources on X.According to Dawn, Taliban regime posts suffered heavy damage and a tank caught fire after being hit, with Taliban fighters fleeing from their positions. A later report added: “Another post and tank position of the Afghan Taliban destroyed in Kurram sector.”Tahir Ahrar, a deputy police spokesperson in Afghanistan’s Khost province, confirmed the clashes but provided no further details.This marks the second time this week that both sides have exchanged fire along their long shared border.Pakistan’s state-run media reported that Afghan forces and Pakistani Taliban jointly opened fire at a Pakistani post “without provocation,” prompting what the media described as a “strong response” from Pakistani troops in Kurram, a district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Security officials also said Pakistan’s military destroyed a sprawling training facility of the Pakistani Taliban.There was no immediate comment from Pakistan’s military, which has been on high alert since Saturday when both sides traded fire across multiple border regions, resulting in dozens of casualties on each side.Although the clashes paused on Sunday after appeals from Saudi Arabia and Qatar, all border crossings between Pakistan and Afghanistan remain closed.Over the weekend, Kabul said it targeted several Pakistani military posts, killing 58 Pakistani soldiers in retaliation for what it called repeated violations of Afghan territory and airspace. Pakistan’s military reported lower figures, saying it lost 23 soldiers and killed more than 200 “Taliban and affiliated terrorists” in retaliatory fire along the frontier.Tensions have remained high since last week, when the Taliban government accused Pakistan of carrying out airstrikes in Kabul and in an eastern market. Pakistan has not acknowledged those allegations.Pakistan has previously launched strikes inside Afghanistan, saying it targets hideouts of Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a group separate from but allied with the Afghan Taliban.Pakistan accuses Kabul of harbouring the group, which has carried out numerous deadly attacks inside Pakistan. Kabul denies the charge, saying it does not allow its territory to be used against other countries.","State-run media in Pakistan accused Afghan troops of opening “unprovoked firing” that was repulsed.

Tamil Nadu tragedy: Car airbag kills boy sitting on father's lap; driver caught off guard by sudden braking,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tamil-nadu-tragedy-car-airbag-kills-boy-sitting-on-fathers-lap-driver-caught-off-guard-by-sudden-braking/articleshow/124566498.cms,"A seven-year-old boy, Kevin, tragically died when a car's airbag deployed after a collision near Thiruporur





CHENNAI: A seven-year-old boy riding shotgun on his father's lap was killed when the airbag opened after the car rammed a vehicle in front that had braked suddenly near Thiruporur on Monday night. Police identified the child as Kevin, son of Veeramuthu from Pudupattinam village near Kalpakkam.The child was travelling towards the city from Kalpakkam with his mom, dad, driver and two others in a rental car, driven by 26-year-old Vignesh. The group was passing through Alandur via Old Mahabalipuram Road when the driver of a car in front of them hit the brakes suddenly and swerved to the right near the Alathur petrol station.Police said the other driver, 48-year-old Suresh of Paiyanur, had not flashed the indicator. Vignesh, caught off guard by the abrupt manoeuvre, could not stop in time and crashed into Suresh's vehicle.The front airbag deployed during the impact and struck Kevin. The boy lost consciousness though there were no visible injuries.He was taken to the Thiruporur govt hospital, where doctors declared him dead on arrival.The Thiruporur police have registered a case of causing death by negligence and rash driving against Suresh. Kevin's body has been sent to Chengalpattu Medical College and Hospital for postmortem.Police said Suresh's failure to use the indicator and sudden braking at high speed were the primary causes of the collision.The airbag deployment proved fatal as the child was seated in the front seat, they added.Police said they were awaiting the postmortem report to confirm the exact cause of death, though preliminary findings suggest shock and haemorrhage due to polytrauma.","Kevin was riding shotgun on his father's lap when the car rammed a vehicle in front that had braked suddenly near Thiruporur on Monday night.

TIANGUISTENGO: When a river that winds through the mountains of central Mexico suddenly turned into a crushing wall of water this week, it practically wiped the 400-person village of Chapula off the map.Residents only had time to shout, warning neighbors living along the riverbanks, and desperately seek shelter from the deadly flooding and landslides that have cut off 300 towns in central and eastern Mexico from the outside world.Thousands of soldiers and workers scrambled Tuesday to rescue civilians and unblock roads.""There's nothing left. It wiped out houses, it wiped out the bridge, it wiped out everything. The only thing left standing was the church and the warehouse where we were seeking refuge,"" said 21-year-old Stephanie Ramirez, who was part of a group of elderly, women and children who stumbled off a rescue helicopter Tuesday.The government confirmed that at least 64 people have died due to the torrential rains. Dozens are still missing and officials warn the full extent of the devastation in remote towns of a couple hundred to 1,000 residents remains unknown.The rains were triggered by the convergence of two tropical storms churning off Mexico's western coast, striking at the end of an unusually heavy rainy season that has left rivers overflowing and hillsides weakened.Ramirez and her grandmother were evacuated after days of hoping help would come. The rest of her family and dozens of their neighbors were still waiting to be evacuated. As more rain threatened to pour down, they sought shelter on a nearby hillside on the verge of collapsing next to the still-swollen river.""We have to get them out. They're in constant danger there,"" Ramirez said.Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday that one of the government's priorities was to open roads and ""to secure air bridges, food supplies, water, and check on how each person is faring.""Thousands of military and civilian personnel were working tirelessly on those efforts Tuesday, but in Chapula, residents decided to organise on their own. According to Ramirez, they called their relatives in the United States, ""and it was them who made arrangements to get us out of there little-by-little.""With help from residents of the nearby town of Tianguistengo, a private air bridge began operating, using a borrowed helicopter to evacuate groups of about half a dozen people at a time, while other residents organised bags of basic goods to carry on foot, with some soldiers, to neighboring villages that were still cut off.""We think it's about six or seven hours walking, but we want people to know that we're working ... that they can see we also care about their situation,"" said local resident Neptali Rodriguez.The hardest-hit states are Veracruz, Hidalgo and Puebla. In Hidalgo alone, where roughly half of the isolated villages are located, about 100,000 homes were damaged or destroyed by flooding rivers and mudslides. In Veracruz, where at least 29 people died, rainfall reached 24 inches in just four days. Veracruz Gov. Rocio Nahle said more than 300,000 people were affected in the state alone.On Tuesday, public officials were going door-to-door in cities like Poza Rica, Veracruz, where water from the overflowing Cazones River on Friday reached 13 feet (four meters) high in some areas. They were asking residents if anyone was missing.According to the National Civil Protection Coordination, 67 people were still unaccounted for as of Tuesday.Health teams had began fumigating affected areas to prevent outbreaks of dengue, a disease spread by mosquitoes.In Poza Rica, resident Roberto Olvera said an oil refinery alarm alerted him to rising waters.""It was terrifying, many people in the neighborhood couldn't escape,"" he said. Floodwaters there also left a black, oily residue believed to have come from nearby oil and gas installations, coating trees and rooftops.Dozens of health centers were damaged, including one in Alamo, Veracruz, where floodwaters reached two meters (6.5 feet), destroying all equipment. Local health director Marti Batres said medical staff are now working outdoors.While thousands of soldiers and rescue teams search for the missing and deliver aid, helicopters are ferrying supplies to isolated zones and private construction firms are helping to reopen key roads.Sheinbaum said there are enough resources to respond and that the government ""will spare no expense during this emergency.""",Thousands of soldiers and workers scrambled Tuesday to rescue civilians and unblock roads.

College questions petitioner's ‘motives’

Property a ‘developer’s dream’





A Florida judge on Tuesday temporarily blocked the planned transfer of prime downtown Miami land for the future Donald J Trump presidential library. The library is set to be built on a plot owned by Miami Dade College.Circuit Judge Mavel Ruiz said the college’s board of trustees, which initially gifted the “sizable plot” of real estate to the state, had violated a Florida government law. According to Ruiz, the board “didn’t give the public reasonable notice ahead of the vote last month.”“This is not an easy decision,” Ruiz told reporters from the bench, as reported by The Associated Press. She added, “This is not a case, at least for this court, rooted in politics.”The lawsuit was filed last month by activist Marvin Dunn, who alleged that the board violated Florida’s “Government in the Sunshine” law by failing to provide sufficient notice for its special meeting on September 23, when it voted to give up the land.As per Dunn’s complaint, the agenda released ahead of the meeting “simply stated the board would consider conveying property to a state fund overseen by Florida governor Ron DeSantis and the Florida Cabinet,” but it “provided no details on which piece of property was being considered or why.”Dunn also noted that, unlike every other meeting the board had held this year, this meeting was not livestreamed.A week later, DeSantis, who is from Trump's Republican Party, and other top officials voted to transfer the land again, effectively putting the property under the control of the president's family.The case comes despite DeSantis signing a bill earlier this year pre-empting local governments from blocking the development of the library, a move aimed at overruling potential opposition in liberal-leaning counties or municipalities.Jesus Suarez, an attorney for Miami Dade College, argued that the college did “what was required under the law” and questioned Marvin Dunn’s “political motivations” for filing the lawsuit.“There is no requirement under Florida law that there be specificity on notice, because those trustees can come into that room and talk to each other about whatever they wish,” Suarez said.Attorneys for Dunn countered that no one who wasn’t already aware of the deal could have known what the board would decide.“The people have a right to know what they’re going to decide to do when the transaction is so significant, so unusual and deprives the students and the college of this land,” plaintiff’s attorney Richard Brodsky told The Associated Press prior to the judge’s decision.The nearly 3-acre (1.2-hectare) property has been described as a “developer’s dream” and is valued at more than $67 million, according to a 2025 assessment by the Miami-Dade County property appraiser. Other Florida locations had previously been considered for the library, including sites associated with Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton and Florida International University in suburban Miami.","Donald J Trump's presidential library is set to be built on a plot owned by Miami Dade College.

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday voiced disappointment with Russian President Vladimir Putin for continuing the war in Ukraine, calling it the ""biggest conflict since World War II.""“Look, I’m very disappointed because Vladimir and I had a very good relationship — probably still do. I don’t know why he continues with this war. This war has been so bad for him,” Trump told reporters during a bilateral meeting with Argentine President Javier Milei at the White House.“He’s going into four years of a war he should have won in one week. He’s lost 1.5 million soldiers, or close to it — all the things that happen in horrible wars. It’s the biggest thing that has happened since World War II in terms of death,” he added.Trump’s comments came ahead of his scheduled meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House on Friday. The two leaders are expected to discuss ongoing US support for Kyiv.Trump had previously hosted Putin for talks on Ukraine at a military facility in Anchorage, Alaska, on August 15. That meeting marked the first in-person encounter between the two leaders during Trump’s second term, which began in January. His administration has been seeking to broker an end to the conflict or at least a temporary ceasefire, with Trump appointing a special envoy (Steve Witkoff) for the effort.Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine began on February 24, 2022, when Moscow launched what it called a “special military operation.”","US President Donald Trump voiced disappointment with Russian President Vladimir Putin for continuing the war in Ukraine.

Hamas published a video on Monday showing eight blindfolded and kneeling men being executed in the streets, branding them ""collaborators and outlaws.""The footage surfaced amid armed clashes between Hamas security units and Palestinian clans, on the fifth day of a US-brokered truce between Israel and the militant group.Hamas proceeded to take control of Gaza on Tuesday, even as US President Donald Trump vowed to disarm the group under a recently brokered ceasefire.The Israeli military confirmed that the remains of four more hostages held in Gaza were handed to the Red Cross, following the release of four others and the safe return of 20 surviving captives.In northern Gaza, as Israeli forces withdrew from Gaza City, Hamas’s black-masked police resumed street patrols. Hamas’s Brigades helped control crowds when freed prisoners arrived in Gaza on Monday. A new Hamas security unit, called the Deterrence Force, has been targeting armed clans and gangs, some of which are said to have Israeli support.Hamas has dominated Gaza since 2007 after defeating rival faction Fatah. Israel insists Hamas must not play any role in a future Gaza government, hand back the remains of 24 deceased hostages, and eventually disarm.Trump has warned that those who refuse to surrender their weapons will be forcibly disarmed. The US-brokered 20-point peace plan, endorsed by world powers at a Trump-led summit in Egypt, demands a demilitarised Gaza and no leadership role for Hamas.Meanwhile, Israeli families continued pressing for the return of the remains of 24 hostages still held by Hamas.The Israeli army confirmed four more bodies were transferred to the Red Cross and on their way to custody. The military identified two victims as Guy Iluz, an Israeli national, and Bipin Joshi, an agriculture student from Nepal. Two others were later named as Yossi Sharabi and Daniel Peretz.Trump celebrated the ceasefire during a visit to Jerusalem with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and later joined regional leaders in Egypt to sign a declaration aimed at cementing the truce.","Hamas published a video on Monday showing eight blindfolded and kneeling men being executed in the streets, branding them ""collaborators and outlaws"" The footage surfaced amid armed clashes between Hamas security units and Palestinian clans, on the fifth day of a US-brokered truce between Israel and the militant group.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124561949,imgsize-395662,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Was Mr. FAFO part of Hamas?







A well-known Palestinian protester and influencer, popularly known online as “Mr FAFO,” was reportedly killed on Sunday amid violent clashes between Hamas and rival Palestinian factions in Gaza.The 27-year-old Saleh al-Jafarawi became known as “Mr FAFO” — short for “F** Around and Find Out”* — in Israeli media because he allegedly celebrated the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, which killed over 1,200 civilians and saw many taken hostage. Later in the war, he was also filmed crying in reaction to Israel’s airstrikes.Mixed reactions poured in following Jafarawi’s death. Many Israelis cheered the news, calling him a Hamas propagandist who fuelled anti-Israel sentiment. On the other hand, pro-Palestinian activists mourned his loss, remembering him as a passionate voice who documented the struggle in Gaza.Footage circulating online reportedly showed his body, with reports suggesting he was killed while covering the incident.After celebrating the October 7 invasion, “Mr FAFO” made more videos in which he pretended to be a doctor, a wounded patient, a fighter, and a journalist.These videos went viral but drew widespread ridicule, especially from pro-Israel viewers, who saw them as fake, staged, and ""lazy propaganda"" rather than serious reporting.During the conflict, he faced accusations on social media of pocketing millions of dollars raised as donations for Gaza residents, including money reportedly intended to build a children’s hospital, reports Times of Israel.“Controversial Gaza activist, derogatorily called ‘Mr FAFO’ due to his performative antics and well known for his support of Hamas and raising an estimated $10 million to build a children’s hospital, only to pocket the money, Saleh Al-Jafarawi, was killed today by unknown assailants,” said Palestinian-American anti-Hamas activist Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib.Alkhatib added that Jafarawi was allegedly accompanying Hamas’s “Saham” unit during clashes with the Doghmosh clan in Gaza City, possibly acting as a cameraman. Hamas-affiliated channels have announced his death, possibly to incite violence against the clan. Alkhatib suggested three possible culprits: Hamas to seize his digital wallet and stir civil war; the Doghmosh clan in retaliation for Hamas raids; or anti-Hamas fighters targeting a terror propagandist. He added that Jafarawi’s body reportedly showed signs of torture.“For the last two years, I have followed Hamas content creator Saleh Al-Jafrawi (‘Mr FAFO’) with a mix of horror and admiration. I was engrossed. Mr FAFO had phenomenal energy, charisma, and creativity. Always popping up in a different costume, once a patient then a radiologist, a jihadist then a foreign correspondent, a ham actor but always with panache and chutzpah, constantly finding inventive ways to grab new audiences and tell his story,” said former Israeli spokesperson Eylon Levy.","27-year-old Saleh al-Jafarawi became known as “Mr FAFO” in Israeli media.

Sophie Grégoire, ex-wife of Justin Trudeau , posted an uncanny message on Instagram on Monday, day after photos surfaced online showing the former Canadian Prime Minister kissing pop singer Katy Perry aboard her yacht.The post hinted at moving on, with Grégoire postin: “The people, the places, even the moments that once felt, I don’t know, infinite—time asks us to not cling to them. And yet we do, I do, because to hold on feels safer than to let go.”Grégoire continued, “Love was never about possession. It was always about presence, the present moment. And when we release what we cannot keep, we make space for the truth of connection, intimacy, the memory, you know, for the lesson, for the way a single smile can echo across a lifetime.” She added, “Sometimes we forget that nothing we love was ever meant to be kept.”The couple shares three children—Xavier, Ella-Grace, and Hadrien. They announced their separation in August 2023 after 18 years of marriage.Trudeau, 53, has faced months of rumours linking him romantically with Katy Perry, 40, who split from actor Orlando Bloom in June.The rumours grew on Sunday after the Daily Mail shared photos of Trudeau and Perry kissing on her luxury yacht near Santa Barbara, California.“Maybe love’s deepest teaching is this—to stand open-hearted in the face of impermanence, to honour what has been and to trust that letting go is also a form of keeping inside us where no loss can erase it,” Grégoire said in the Instagram video. “That is love’s endurance. That is what carries us forward.”Trudeau and Perry were also seen together in Montreal in July, sharing a private dinner. Perry has a 5-year-old daughter, Daisy Dove Bloom, with Orlando Bloom and was previously married to comedian Russell Brand.Sources told the Daily Mail that the singer is “very, very interested in him. She says he's a real catch, a high-quality guy. She clearly likes him a lot. He likes her a lot.”Trudeau has not publicly commented on the relationship. Social media reactions to the yacht photos have been mixed, with some critics questioning his commitment to his family and Canada.","Sophie Grégoire, ex-wife of Justin Trudeau, posted an uncanny message on Instagram on Monday, day after photos surfaced online showing the former Canadian Prime Minister kissing Katy Perry aboard her yacht.

IDF launches Operation “Returning Home”



All dead hostages may not be back on Monday







Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday acknowledged divisions over the Gaza ceasefire deal but urged citizens to unite ahead of the expected release of hostages held by Hamas under the prisoner exchange agreement.“This is an emotional evening, an evening of tears, an evening of joy, because tomorrow our children will return to our borders,” Netanyahu said in a televised address, quoting a biblical verse. “Tomorrow is the beginning of a new path - a path of rebuilding, a path of healing, and, I hope, a path of united hearts.”The Prime Minister’s remarks came amid criticism from both sides of Israel’s political spectrum - from families of hostages who accused him of prioritising military goals over their release, and from right-wing members of his coalition who opposed freeing Palestinian prisoners.“This is a historic event that mixes sorrow over the release of murderers with joy over the return of hostages,” Netanyahu said.“I know there are many disagreements among us, but on this day ... we have every reason to put them aside, because together we achieved tremendous victories,” he added.Netanyahu also said Israel was ready to receive the hostages expected to be freed on Monday. “Israel is prepared and ready for the immediate reception of all our hostages,” he said in a separate statement issued Sunday.He added that while Israel had made “tremendous victories” during two years of conflict, the fight was not over: “Together we achieved tremendous victories, victories that amazed the whole world... But at the same time I must tell you, the fight is not over,” Netanyahu said. “Very large security challenges still lie before us.”Meanwhile, the Israel defense forces (IDF) announced the launch of Operation “Returning Home” to bring back the hostages. “In a few hours we will all be reunited - one people, embraced and united,” said Lt Gen Eyal Zamir, Israel’s Chief of the General Staff, in a statement posted on X.He said the operation followed two years of sustained military and diplomatic pressure. “The military pressure we applied over the past two years, together with the complementary diplomatic measures, constitute a victory over Hamas,” Zamir added. “We will continue to act in order to ensure the Gaza Strip no longer poses a threat to the State of Israel and its civilians.”An Israeli Military official said that they are expecting that not all dead hostages may return to Israel on Monday.""Unfortunately this is something we anticipate that not all fallen hostages will be returned tomorrow,"" the official told reporters during a briefing late on Sunday.Earlier Sunday, Shosh Bedrosian, spokeswoman for the prime minister's office, had said an ""international body"" would be established to locate the remains of captives not returned as part of Monday's exchange.Israel, however, will not send a representative to the US-led peace summit on Gaza scheduled Monday in Sharm el-Sheikh, co-hosted by President Donald Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, according to a statement to AFP by Netanyahu’s spokeswoman Shosh Bedrosian.(With inputs from agencies)",Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday acknowledged divisions over the Gaza ceasefire deal.

The US State Department has revoked the visas of six foreigners, accusing them of “celebrating” the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.The action came on Tuesday, the day Kirk would have turned 32. The day also saw Trump formally honour his ally with a Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States, which he had announced following the Turning Point USA co-founder’s killing on September 10.“The United States has no obligation to host foreigners who wish death on Americans. The State Department continues to identify visa holders who celebrated the heinous assassination of Charlie Kirk. Here are just a few examples of aliens who are no longer welcome in the US,” the State Department posted on X.The six individuals are from Argentina, Brazil, Germany, Mexico, Paraguay, and South Africa.“@POTUS and @SecRubio will defend our borders, our culture, and our citizens by enforcing our immigration laws. Aliens who take advantage of America’s hospitality while celebrating the assassination of our citizens will be removed,” the State Department warned.The crackdown aligns with US secretary of state Marco Rubio ’s warning to those “cheering on the public assassination of a political figure (Kirk)” to ""prepare for visa revocation and deportation.""Kirk was shot while addressing a Turning Point USA event at Utah Valley University.

'A very rich gentleman offered': Trump asked if he could pay troops amid govt shutdown? His response,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/a-very-rich-gentleman-offered-trump-asked-if-he-could-pay-troops-amid-govt-shutdown-his-response/articleshow/124565669.cms,"



Reeling under a government shutdown, US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said that a ""very wealthy gentleman"" has offered to pay the salaries of US troops if funding runs out.While talking to reporters, Trump said the government has money to pay the salaries of US soldiers, but the government is being forced into this position by the Democrats.""I do... I actually have a man who is a very wealthy person... a donor, a great gentleman, and he said, 'If there's any money necessary, shortfall, for the paying of the troops, then I will pay it,' meaning he will pay it,"" Trump said.""And I said... look, we are not gonna need it. We are going to take care of our troops, but this was a position that is being forced upon us by Democrats,"" he added.The US President's remarks came as the government shutdown is barreling toward its second week, leaving thousands of federal employees without pay as Washington’s funding battle drags on.Amid the standoff, the administration has begun laying off over 4,000 workers — a move seen as an attempt to ramp up pressure on Democrats. But despite the political brinkmanship, signs suggest the shutdown could stretch even longer, prompting speculation over whether it might break past records.With no resolution in sight, the shutdown is expected to continue indefinitely as Republicans and Democrats remain locked in a tussle over health care funding.The longest shutdown on record commenced on December 22, 2018, during President Donald Trump's first term at the White House. Democrats in Congress refused to support a spending bill that included Trump's 4,730 crore request for fencing on the US-Mexico border.Lawmakers ultimately approved a spending bill without funding for the border wall, which Trump signed into law on January 25, 2019, ending the shutdown.The government partially shut down on December 16, 1995, amid a clash between the Republican-controlled Congress and then-President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, over balancing the budget.At the heart of the dispute is a fight over whether subsidies under the Affordable Care Act should be extended. Democrats insist the support is vital to prevent insurance premiums from spiking, while Republicans argue that the spending bill must not include what they frame as “handouts” connected to immigration and health care.Clinton signed a bill to reopen the government on January 6, 1996. Some polls indicated that the public largely blamed Republicans in Congress for the shutdown, and some analysts suggested the dispute helped Clinton win reelection in 1996.","US President Donald Trump said a ""very wealthy gentleman"" has offered to pay the salaries of US troops if funding runs out.

However, while the MEA has started preparations for a high-level participation by India, New Delhi is yet to confirm that PM Modi will attend the Asean and East Asia meetings in Malaysia.","US President Donald Trump will visit Malaysia on Oct 26, foreign minister Mohamad Hasan said.

Pakistan-Afghanistan Clashes: Heavy Fighting Along Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Border, Taliban Posts Damaged

Poll Should countries take stronger action to secure their borders against militant attacks? Yes, strict security is necessary No, dialogue and diplomacy are better





Pakistani troops engaged in heavy fighting with Afghan Taliban fighters on Tuesday night along the Kurram district border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The clashes came after the Taliban and militants linked to the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan , called Fitna al-Khawarij by authorities, reportedly opened fire without warning.PTV News said several Taliban posts were heavily damaged, including at least one tank, and fighters fled their positions. Later reports added that additional posts and tank positions, including Shamsadar post, were destroyed, and a senior Fitna al-Khawarij commander was killed.Earlier, Pakistan’s foreign secretary Amna Baloch briefed resident ambassadors in Islamabad, stressing “Pakistan’s legitimate security concerns and its unwavering resolve to protect its territorial integrity and national security.”Over the weekend, Taliban forces allegedly attacked Pakistani border posts, killing 23 troops. Islamabad responded, claiming more than 200 Taliban and allied militants were killed. Kabul called the strike “retaliatory,” accusing Pakistan of air raids inside Afghan territory last week, which Pakistan has denied.","Pakistan-Afghanistan Clashes: Heavy Fighting Along Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Border, Taliban Posts Damaged.
