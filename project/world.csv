A tragic incident occurred on Tuesday evening at the construction site of the Mumbai-Ahmedabad Bullet Train corridor in Vasad village, leading to the death of three workers and injuring another. The mishap involved the collapse of a temporary steel and concrete structure used for well foundation work near the Mahi River.Initial reports suggested that an under-construction bridge had collapsed. However, the National High Speed Rail Corporation Limited (NHSRCL) clarified that the incident involved a temporary structure for well foundation work. The structure, made of steel and concrete blocks weighing 2.5 tons each, was supported by high-tensile (HT) strands. The collapse was attributed to the snapping of these strands, causing the blocks to fall and trap four workers.Swift rescue operations were launched, involving cranes, excavators, local volunteers, and assistance from the state administration, police, and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF). Despite their efforts, three workers lost their lives, while one survivor is undergoing treatment.Anand Superintendent of Police Gaurav Jasani confirmed, ""Three workers died, and another is undergoing treatment at the hospital."" Fire officer Dharmesh Gor added that two workers died on the spot, and a third succumbed to injuries later at the hospital.Railway sources provided a detailed account: ""This evening, while sinking in one of the wells at Mahi River in Anand District, concrete blocks fell, trapping four laborers. Immediate rescue operations were undertaken by mobilizing cranes and excavators at the site, with assistance from locals, state administration, police, and the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF). All four workmen were rescued. Unfortunately, three were declared dead, and one is under treatment.""The statement continued, ""The work involved sinking 610 meters, of which 582 meters have been completed. The collapse occurred during the sinking of concrete blocks, each weighing 2.5 tons, loaded on a frame supported by high-tensile (HT) strands. Although 16 strands were provided as per the design for four, some strands snapped, causing the blocks to fall. A detailed technical inquiry is underway to ascertain the exact cause of the incident.""An ex-gratia payment of Rs 20 lakh each has been provided to the families of the deceased workers.Superintendent of Police Gaurav Jasani confirmed, ""Three workers died, and another is undergoing treatment at the hospital."" Fire officer Dharmesh Gor added, ""Two died on the spot, and the third succumbed to injuries at the hospital.""The local community played a significant role in rescue efforts, joining forces with emergency responders to clear debris and ensure no additional workers were trapped. The rescue teams continue to remove the fallen blocks to verify the safety of the site.The NHSRCL has announced a detailed technical inquiry to determine the cause of the collapse.","A temporary structure for well foundation work collapsed in Anand, India.

Thousands take out solidarity rally; cops call gathering 'unlawful'

Peel police officer suspended after participating in protest outside temple

Three arrested for violence

Jaishankar says India deeply concerned

A massive crowd gathered outside Hindu Sabha Mandir in Brampton, Canada on Monday night in solidarity with the temple and the community after an attack at the same place a day before.On Sunday, an Indian consular camp at the Hindu Sabha Temple witnessed a 'violent disruption' near Toronto. Following the attacks, the Hindu Canadian Foundation, a non-profit organisation working for the Hindu community in Canada, shared a video of the attack on the temple and claimed that pro-Khalistani supporters attacked kids and women.Both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Canadian counterpart Justin Trudeau condemned the incident.""I strongly condemn the deliberate attack on a Hindu temple in Canada. Equally appalling are the cowardly attempts to intimidate our diplomats. Such acts of violence will never weaken India's resolve. We expect the Canadian government to ensure justice and uphold the rule of law,"" PM Modi said on X.Earlier, Trudeau had taken to Twitter and said, ""The acts of violence at the Hindu Sabha Mandir in Brampton today are unacceptable. Every Canadian has the right to practice their faith freely and safely.""More than a thousand Canadian Hindus assembled outside the Hindu Sabha Mandir in Brampton on Monday evening to protest against the recent attacks. The rally saw organizers urging Canadian politicians and law enforcement agencies to cease support for Khalistanis.The Coalition of Hindus of North America (CoHNA) shared details of the event on social media platform X, stating: ""Over a thousand #CanadianHindus have gathered in Brampton to protest against the increasingly brazen attacks on Hindu Temples. Yesterday, during the sacred #Diwali weekend, Canadian Hindu temples, coast to coast, came under attack. We ask Canada to stop this #Hinduphobia now!""Sikhs for Justice, a pro-Khalistan group with a presence in Canada and the US, said their members were 'peacefully protesting' outside the Hindu temple against the presence of Indian consular officials who they say were inside.The gathering, however, was declared an 'unlawful assembly' by the peel regional police order. The police notice said, ""Peel regional police public order is being deployed at a demonstration on the Gore Road near Tyler Avenue. This is in response to weapons seen within the crowd of demonstators. We are asking the public to avoid the area as officers respond. This is now an unlawful assembly and we will be clearing the area. All individuals are to face arrest.""A peel regional police officer is on suspension after appearing in videos of a protest at the Hindu Sabha temple in Brampton on Sunday. The officer, Sergeant Harinder Sohi, is an 18-year veteran of the force.Videos circulating on social media show Sohi at the protest. Peel police spokesperson, Richard Chin, stated, “We are aware of a video circulating on social media which appears to show one of our off duty officers participating in a protest.”Although no allegations of wrongdoing have been made against Sohi, he has received death threats on social media following his suspension. The Peel Regional Police Association is providing support and protection to Sohi.Peel regional police said that they made several arrests in connection to the protests in Brampton and Mississauga, Ontario. Four people were arrested, including 43-year-old Dilpreet Singh Bouns, 23-year-old Vikas, and 31-year-old Amritpal Singh.A fourth individual, who was not identified, was arrested on an outstanding unrelated warrant and released.External affairs minister S Jaishankar, who is in Australia for the 15th India-Australia Foreign Ministers' Framework Dialogue, was asked about the attack in Brampton.""What happened yesterday at the Hindu temple in Canada was deeply concerning...you should have seen the statement by our official spokesperson and also the expression of concern by our PM yesterday. That should convey to you how deeply we feel about it,"" Jaishankar said.","A massive crowd gathered outside Hindu Sabha Mandir in Brampton, Canada on Monday night in solidarity with the temple and the community after an attack at the same place a day before.

Bulldozer in J&K? LG warns against sheltering ultras,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2-terrorists-killed-in-north-kashmir-as-forces-intensify-crackdown/articleshow/114990690.cms,"This is a representational image (Pic credit: ANI)

SRINAGAR:

Statehood ‘certain’

Security forces killed two terrorists Tuesday in a seek-and-kill operation in north Kashmir’s Bandipora district, part of an intensified sweep following a rise in attacks across the valley since an elected govt took office in J&K after six years in mid-Oct.“The slain terrorists’ identities have not yet been confirmed and forces are conducting a mop-up operation in the area,” an official said.Lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha vowed that those targeting civilians “won’t go unpunished” and warned that houses of people sheltering terrorists would be demolished.“I have directed the forces not to harm any innocent, but the culprits will not be spared. If anyone provides shelter to terrorists, then his house will be razed to the ground,” he said at a function in Baramulla.As security forces targeted terrorists and their support networks, a man from Sopore, identified as Ashiq Hussain Wani, was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of being a “hybrid terrorist” — a term used for radicalised people who conduct attacks and then blend back into everyday life. Police claimed to have seized a pistol and seven rounds of ammunition from him.Recent terrorist attacks have led to multiple casualties. On Oct 14, an ambush near Gulmarg in Baramulla killed two soldiers and two civilian porters. In Shopian, a migrant worker from Bihar was fatally shot on Oct 18, followed by the murder of seven tunnel construction workers in Ganderbal on Oct 20.The security push has led to multiple gunfights, including one on Nov 2 when Lashkar-e-Taiba commander Usman alias Chota Waleed from Pakistan was killed in Srinagar. On the same day, two unidentified terrorists were gunned down in Anantnag. However, terrorists retaliated with a grenade attack the next day, wounding 12 people in a busy Srinagar market.Sources attributed the recent uptick in violence to two factors: the incoming winter, which will limit movement, and frustration among Pakistan-based “handlers” over the peaceful assembly elections in J&K, the first in a decade.LG Sinha said Pakistan continues to push terrorists across the border and emphasised that ending violence requires local cooperation. “It is not just the job of the security forces and the administration but the people as well to identify such people (terrorists),” he said, adding that with civilian support, terrorism could be eradicated from J&K within a year.Restoration of statehood is “as certain as the sun rising from the east”, LG Sinha said Tuesday, echoing the focal point of his speech the day before at the inaugural assembly session of J&K as a Union territory.He was quick to add that no political efforts or promises are required to fulfil this commitment, responding to NC-led governing coalition’s repeated pledges to restore J&K’s statehood.",Security forces kill two terrorists in a seek-and-kill operation in north Kashmir’s Bandipora district.

I think those who only issue statements for formality are worse than them (terrorists),"" the LG said.""Our neighbour is trying, but it does not worry us.

Canadian authorities were intimated about the camp, which was organised for the benefit of local life certificate beneficiaries

NEW DELHI: India condemned violence by proKhalistan separatists at a Hindu temple, and their efforts to disrupt Indian consular activities, in Brampton, Canada , with PM Modi taking to X to assert that the country’s resolve would not be weakened by such acts and sought action against the perpetrators.“I strongly condemn the deliberate attack on a Hindu temple in Canada. Equally appalling are the cowardly attempts to intimidate our diplomats. Such acts of violence will never weaken India’s resolve. We expect the Canadian govt to ensure justice and uphold the rule of law,” Modi said hours after the foreign ministry condemned the incident that took place on Sunday. The ministry said New Delhi remained deeply concerned about the safety and security of Indian nationals in Canada and asked the Canadian authorities to ensure that all places of worship are protected from such attacks. New Delhi has repeatedly stated in the middle of its ongoing diplomatic spat with Ottawa that its main concern with Canada remains the space given by local authorities to pro-Khalistan separatists, allowing them to target Indian interests.On this occasion, Canadian PM Justin Trudeau, who has been accused of being sympathetic to the Khalistan cause due to votebank considerations, said on X, “The acts of violence at the Hindu Sabha Mandir in Brampton today are unacceptable. Every Canadian has the right to practise their faith freely and safely. Thank you to Peel Regional Police for swiftly responding to protect the community and investigate this incident.”Canadian authorities had been intimated about the consular camp being organised in collaboration with the temple for the benefit of local life certificate beneficiaries.Video clips of Sunday’s assault purportedly showed pro-Khalistan demonstrators attacking a crowd of devotees in Hindu Sabha Mandir. One video purportedly showed police pinning down a Hindu youth and handcuffing him, drawing comparisons by commentators with the George Floyd incident in America and leading Canadian MP Chandra Arya to say that his suspicions about Khalistanis infiltrating Canadian law enforcement have been strengthened.Arya said the incident represented a “red line” crossed by Khalistani activists against Hindu devotees. He also referred to the aggressive conduct of Brampton police towards Hindus protesting against the attack.PM Modi’s statement is the second instance in recent months that he has taken up the issue of reported attacks on Hindus outside India. In August this year, he raised with Muhammad Yunus, chief adviser of Bangladesh, the alleged targeting of Hindus and other minorities post the regime change in the neighbouring country.In an official statement, the Indian govt said the outreach of Indian consular officers to provide services to Indians and Canadian citizens alike would not be deterred by intimidation, harassment and violence.“We condemn the acts of violence perpetrated by extremists and separatists at the Hindu Sabha temple in Brampton city in Ontario, yesterday,” MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.“We call on the govt of Canada to ensure that all places of worship are protected from such attacks. We also expect that those indulging in violence will be prosecuted,” Jaiswal said.On Sunday, Peel Regional Police said a protest occurred at the Hindu Sabha Mandir in Brampton and unverified videos circulating on social media appeared to show demonstrators holding banners in support of Khalistan, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported.The Indian high commission said it was disappointed to see such disruptions being allowed for routine consular work being organised with the fullest cooperation of local co-organisers.“We remain concerned for the safety of applicants, including Indian nationals, on whose demand such events are organised in the first place. Despite these efforts by anti-India elements, our consulate was able to issue more than 1,000 life certificates to Indian and Canadian applicants,” it added.",PM Modi takes to X to assert that the country’s resolve would not be weakened by such acts.

NEW DELHI: Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for the 2024 US presidential election , has clinched several key states across the nation, securing crucial electoral votes as he aims for a return to the White House. Seeking redemption after his loss in the 2020 election, Trump’s campaign has focused on strong stances on immigration, the economy, and national security, alongside maintaining significant influence within the Republican Party.Donald Trump won Iowa in the 2024 presidential race, securing the state's six electoral votes. Iowa, once a swing state, has become a stronghold for Trump, who has now won it in three consecutive elections. The state, which backed Democrat Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, shifted toward Trump in 2016 and reaffirmed its support in 2020. Trump, who previously earned the backing of Iowa's Republican caucus voters, continues to maintain strong support among GOP voters, consolidating his position in the state. The Associated Press declared Trump the winner at 10:40 p.m. EST on November 6.Donald Trump won Missouri in the 2024 presidential race, defeating Vice President Kamala Harris and securing the state’s 10 electoral votes. This marks Trump’s third consecutive win in Missouri, having previously triumphed over Democratic candidates in both the 2016 and 2020 elections by margins exceeding 15%. Missouri has long been a reliable Republican stronghold in presidential contests.Donald Trump won Texas, securing 40 electoral votes. This outcome was widely anticipated, as Texas has leaned Republican in recent presidential races. Trump won the state by 6 percentage points in 2020 and by 9 points in 2016. Texas has long been a Republican stronghold, with its substantial number of electoral votes making it a crucial state for any presidential candidate.Donald Trump won Ohio, a crucial swing state that has leaned increasingly Republican in recent years. With 16 electoral votes at stake, Trump secured a victory in the Buckeye State, where he has won by margins of more than 8 points in both the 2016 and 2020 elections. This marked a notable shift for Ohio, which had historically supported Democrats, including President Obama in 2008 and 2012. However, the state backed the losing candidate in 2020 for the first time since 1964.Trump's victory in Ohio was further bolstered by his selection of the state's junior senator, JD Vance, as his vice-presidential running mate. Despite past tensions between Trump and Vance, the senator has become one of the former president’s strongest allies.Donald Trump wins Wyoming in the 2024 presidential race, continuing his dominant performance in the state. Trump previously won Wyoming by significant margins in both the 2016 and 2020 elections, defeating his Democratic opponents by approximately 45 percentage points in each cycle. Wyoming, with its three Electoral College votes, remains a solidly Republican state.In recent years, Wyoming has gained national attention due to the outspoken criticism of Trump by former Representative Liz Cheney, a member of the state's political establishment. Cheney, who served as vice chair of the January 6th committee, notably endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 race, marking a sharp contrast to her state's continued support for Trump.Donald Trump wins Louisiana in the 2024 presidential race, securing eight electoral votes. Trump previously won the state by a wide margin in both 2016 and 2020, capturing 58.5% of the vote in 2016 and maintaining a similar percentage in the 2020 election.Louisiana has remained a strong Republican stronghold for decades. The last time the state voted for a Democratic president was in 1996, when President Bill Clinton won the state.Donald Trump wins South Dakota in the 2024 presidential race, securing three electoral votes, according to a projection from Decision Desk HQ. South Dakota, a staunchly Republican state, has supported Trump in both his previous campaigns, with the former president winning by 30 percentage points over Hillary Clinton in 2016 and by 26 percentage points over Joe Biden in 2020.South Dakota has remained a stronghold for the Republican Party, with the last time a Democratic presidential candidate won the state being in 1964.Donald Trump wins North Dakota in the 2024 presidential election, securing three electoral votes. North Dakota has consistently supported Republican candidates, with Trump maintaining strong support in the state during both his 2016 and 2020 campaigns.Trump also benefited from the support of North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, who was one of his top backers after his own unsuccessful bid for the Republican nomination.Former President Donald Trump has secured Arkansas' six electoral votes, marking his third consecutive win in the state. With the support of top Republican figures like Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who previously served as Trump's White House press secretary, Arkansas remains a Republican stronghold. Trump has maintained dominance in Arkansas since Bill Clinton's reelection in 1996.Trump has clinched Florida's 30 electoral votes for the third election in a row. Florida, once a battleground state, has increasingly leaned Republican in recent years. The state has not supported a Democratic candidate since 2012, when Barack Obama carried it.Tennessee, which has been firmly in the Republican camp since the 1990s, gave Trump its 11 electoral votes once again. Trump’s consistent margin of victory in Tennessee has grown over the years.Trump took Mississippi's six electoral votes, continuing the state's Republican streak that dates back to 1976. With most of the state's Republican leadership backing his campaign, Trump's dominance was reaffirmed.South Carolina awarded Trump nine electoral votes for the third consecutive election, as the state has consistently supported Republican candidates since 1976.Oklahoma, a state that has not backed a Democrat since 1964, delivered seven electoral votes to Trump.

Judge allows Elon Musk’s $1 million-a-day sweepstakes amid accusations of election interference,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-presidential-elections/judge-allows-elon-musks-1-million-a-day-sweepstakes-amid-accusations-of-election-interference/articleshow/114961506.cms,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk at a rally

A Pennsylvania court has ruled that a high-profile $1 million-a-day sweepstakes, hosted by Elon Musk's America PAC in key swing states, can continue through the presidential election. The decision by Judge Angelo Foglietta on Monday comes after Musk’s lawyers argued that recipients of the sweepstakes are not chosen at random but rather selected based on alignment with the PAC’s values. Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, however, had attempted to halt the programme, describing it as a ""scam"" that breaches state election laws.The sweepstakes, designed to register over a million voters in battleground states, offers substantial payouts to selected participants who sign a petition supporting the First and Second Amendments. Musk’s lawyer, Chris Gober, defended the programme, explaining that recipients were not randomly picked but pre-screened to ensure they represent the PAC’s ideals. Gober confirmed that two more recipients would be named before Election Day, one in Arizona and another in Michigan.In response, Krasner’s legal team argued that the initiative is a thinly veiled attempt to sway the election. Testifying in court, America PAC director Chris Young admitted that recipients undergo personality assessments to determine if they fit the PAC's messaging and sign nondisclosure agreements to keep details of their selection process confidential. In past social media posts, however, Musk indicated that anyone signing the petition had a “chance” to win the daily $1 million prize, which Krasner's team pointed out contradicts claims that winners were not randomly selected.The sweepstakes also caught the attention of the US Justice Department, which recently issued a warning to Musk’s PAC over potential violations of federal election laws, specifically those that prohibit financial incentives tied to voter registration. This caution, reportedly sent by the department’s Public Integrity Section, has prompted America PAC to revise its messaging. Under new guidelines, recipients are now referred to as “spokespersons” rather than “winners,” a change some experts suggest does little to alter the sweepstakes' structure.Legal experts are divided on the issue. Some argue the programme exists in a legal “grey area,” potentially sidestepping direct violation of voter laws, while others contend it skirts dangerously close to illegal compensation for voter participation. Matthew Sanderson, a Republican election law expert, stated that while the programme raises legal questions, it does not necessarily break the law.The sweepstakes has already seen four winners from states like Pennsylvania and Michigan, all of whom publicly endorsed Trump and constitutional rights in promotional videos. America PAC has pledged that all prize funds will be disbursed by the end of November, although it remains unclear whether the recipients have received their winnings. Meanwhile, concerns linger over the PAC's potential long-term use of voter data from over a million registrants, which Krasner suggests may exploit participants beyond the election season.Elon Musk, who did not attend the court hearing, has already poured more than $70 million into the PAC, backing Trump’s campaign and other Republican candidates ahead of the election. Krasner hinted he may pursue civil damages for Pennsylvania residents who signed up for the sweepstakes, suggesting that Musk's operation misuses electoral integrity and infringes on the state’s lottery laws.","A Pennsylvania court has ruled that a high-profile $1 million-a-day sweepstakes, hosted by Elon Musk's America PAC, can continue through the presidential election.

West Virginians' governor choices stand on opposite sides of the abortion debate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/west-virginians-governor-choices-stand-on-opposite-sides-of-the-abortion-debate/articleshow/114975105.cms,"Donald Trump, Patrick Morrisey, and Steve Williams (Picture credit: X)

CHARLESTON: West Virginians on Tuesday will choose between a Republican candidate for governor endorsed by former President Donald Trump who has defended abortion restrictions in court and a Democratic mayor who has fought to put the issue on the ballot for voters to decide.Both attorney general Patrick Morrisey and Huntington mayor Steve Williams have played an outsized role in fighting the drug crisis in the state with the highest rate of opioid overdose deaths in the country. But their similarities are few.When it comes to abortion, the two couldn't be more different.Since he was elected attorney general in 2012, Morrisey, 56, has led litigation against opioid manufacturers and distributors netting around $1 billion to abate the crisis that has led to 6,000 children living in foster care in a state of around 1.8 million.A self-described ""conservative fighter,"" Morrisey has also used his role to lead on issues important to the national GOP. Those include defending a law preventing transgender youth from participating in sports and a scholarship program passed by lawmakers that would incentivize parents to pull their kids from traditional public school and enroll them in private education or homeschooling.Key to his candidacy has been his role in defending a near-total ban on abortions passed by the Republican-controlled legislature in 2022 and going to court to restrict West Virginians' access to abortion pills.In a statement after a US District Court judge blocked access to abortion pills in 2023, Morrisey vowed to ""always stand strong for the life of the unborn.""Former Huntington city manager and House of Delegates member Williams, 60, has worked to change his city from the ""epicenter of the heroin epidemic in America"" to one known for solutions to help people with substance use disorder.After being elected mayor in 2012, he instituted the state's first citywide office of drug control policy and created a strategic plan that involved equipping first responders with the opioid overdose reversal drug Naloxone and implementing court diversion programs for sex workers and people who use drugs.Abortion has been a key part of his campaign platform. Earlier this year, Williams collected thousands of signatures on a petition to push lawmakers to vote to put abortion on the ballot.West Virginia is among the 25 states that do not allow citizen initiatives or constitutional amendments on a statewide ballot, an avenue of direct democracy that has allowed voters to circumvent their legislatures and preserve abortion and other reproductive rights in several states over the past two years.Republicans have repeatedly dismissed the idea of placing an abortion-rights measure before voters, which in West Virginia is a step only lawmakers can take.Republican leadership has pointed to a 2018 vote in which just under 52% of voters supported a constitutional amendment saying there is no right to abortion access in the state. But Williams said the vote also had to do with state funding of abortion, which someone could oppose without wanting access completely eliminated.If elected, Morrisey would become just the third Republican elected to a first gubernatorial term in West Virginia since 1928. Outgoing two-term governor Jim Justice, now a Republican, was first elected as a Democrat in 2016. He switched parties months later at a Trump rally.Polls statewide open at 6:30 am and close at 7:30 pm.","Patrick Morrisey, a Republican, has been endorsed by former President Donald Trump.

Millions cast their votes in US elections poised to reshape the country’s future. The contest pitted former President Donald Trump against vice president Kamala Harris, who could make history as the nation’s first female president.With polls closing in pivotal battleground states like Georgia, this high-stakes race witnessed a flood of voter turnout as the nation chose between two vastly different visions and temperaments for leadership.Throughout Election Day, Americans continued to line up to vote, adding to the staggering 84 million early ballots already cast. This year’s election sees the economy, immigration, and the very foundation of democracy as top issues driving voters to the polls.Both Trump and Harris claimed early victories in their party strongholds, with Trump securing traditionally Republican states and Harris winning in reliably Democratic ones. Meanwhile, Americans cast their ballots in a high-stakes election, setting a clear choice for the nation's future.As the polls closed in critical battleground states—Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, Arizona, Wisconsin, North Carolina, and Nevada—results remained too close to call. These seven fiercely contested states are expected to be pivotal in determining the outcome, with both candidates’ paths to victory hinging on how these swing states ultimately vote.Vice president Kamala Harris secured key Democratic strongholds in the 2024 election, claiming electoral votes from Colorado, the District of Columbia, and Illinois. Colorado, once a swing state, awarded its 10 electoral votes to Harris.In the District of Columbia, Harris easily won the capital’s three electoral votes. Known for its strong Democratic leanings, DC has consistently supported Democratic candidates and often clashed with Republican figures, notably former President Donald Trump.Harris also won Illinois, gaining the state’s 19 electoral votes. As the birthplace of former President Barack Obama, Illinois has been a Democratic stronghold since 1992, consistently favoring Democratic presidential candidates. Indian-American Raja Krishnamoorthi , a Democratic Representative, secured another term in the US House representing Illinois through Tuesday's election. Having first entered Congress in 2016, he currently serves as the ranking Democratic member on the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party.A legal professional with education from Harvard University, Krishnamoorthi previously served in various state positions, including as deputy state treasurer.Sarah McBride, a Democratic state senator from Delaware, achieved a historic milestone on Tuesday by becoming the first openly transgender individual to secure a position in the US House of Representatives.The election results showed McBride securing a decisive victory against her Republican opponent, John Whalen III. US media outlets declared her the winner as she maintained a substantial lead with approximately two-thirds of the votes tallied.Donald Trump secured his third straight victory in Texas during Tuesday's election, Associated Press said, earning 40 electoral votes. The state's electoral count increased by two following the 2020 population census.In Ohio, Trump achieved his third consecutive win, besting Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and claiming the state's 17 electoral votes. Trump also won in Wyoming, Louisiana.The proposed constitutional amendment aimed at safeguarding abortion rights in Florida did not succeed on Tuesday, falling short of the required 60% approval mark.Florida has become the initial state where voters rejected an abortion rights protection initiative since the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v Wade in 2022.Vice president Kamala Harris clinched victory in New York's presidential race on Tuesday, securing the state’s 28 electoral votes. New York has remained a Democratic stronghold in every presidential election since its support for Ronald Reagan in the 1984 landslide.Former President Donald Trump has continued to face challenges in gaining significant support in his home state.Former President Donald Trump clinched victories in Arkansas, South Dakota, and North Dakota on Tuesday, securing their combined twelve electoral votes. Arkansas, with six electoral votes, stayed firmly in the GOP's grasp, backed by prominent state Republicans like Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders.Trump's decisive wins in both South Dakota and North Dakota, each awarding three electoral votes, reflect the strong Republican hold on these states, where conservative values and traditions continue to dominate. South Dakota hasn't swung Democratic since Lyndon B Johnson's 1964 win, and North Dakota remains a steadfast red state, rooted in its agriculture and energy sectors.Lisa Blunt Rochester secured victory over Republican Eric Hansen in Delaware's US Senate election on November 7.Making history, Blunt Rochester will serve as Delaware's first female and first Black senator. The Senate has previously had only three Black women representatives, with two being elected and one receiving an appointment.Former President Donald Trump secured victories in Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Florida on Tuesday, adding to his tally in the presidential race against Democratic vice president Kamala Harris.In Oklahoma, where a Democrat hasn’t won since 1964, Trump claimed the state's seven electoral votes with ease, maintaining the state's longstanding Republican streak. Tennessee also remained firmly in Trump’s corner, delivering 11 electoral votes. Trump had previously won the state by substantial margins in both 2016 and 2020, and his influence helped Republican Senators Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty secure their seats in past elections.Meanwhile, Florida, once a key swing state, gave Trump its 30 electoral votes for the third consecutive election. The Sunshine State has been shifting steadily towards the Republican Party, solidifying Trump’s path to victory in the state once again.Vice president Kamala Harris secured Maryland and its 10 electoral votes on Tuesday, solidifying support in this predominantly Democratic state known for its high concentration of federal employees near Washington, DC.Harris also claimed Massachusetts, where Democratic presidential candidates have enjoyed uninterrupted victories since 1984, when the state last backed Republican Ronald Reagan.In Connecticut, Harris maintained the state’s Democratic leaning, capturing seven more electoral votes as voters extended their tradition of favoring Democratic candidates for a ninth consecutive presidential election.Trump, buoyed by strong support in the South and Midwest, won Indiana and Kentucky, adding 19 electoral votes to his tally. Harris clinched Vermont, a Democratic stronghold that has supported the party in eight consecutive presidential elections.Republican Jim Banks, a strong Trump ally, won Indiana’s open US Senate seat over Democratic newcomer Valerie McCray. Banks’ win reinforces Indiana’s conservative streak, especially since the state has overwhelmingly supported Trump in past elections.In Kentucky, Trump celebrated another victory, marking his third consecutive win in the state since 2016. His connection to the state dates back to his administration, where he collaborated with local leaders to push through major tax cuts and appoint three conservative Supreme Court justices, solidifying his popularity among Kentucky’s Republican base.In a significant early win for Republicans on Election Night, West Virginia governor Jim Justice secured his state’s open US Senate seat, flipping it red after Democrat Joe Manchin’s retirement. Justice, a popular conservative figure in the state, defeated Democrat Glenn Elliott, a former Wheeling mayor, in a closely watched race.Harris claimed victory in Vermont, underscoring her support in progressive regions. Vermont’s Governor Phil Scott, a moderate Republican critical of Trump, had previously voiced support for Democratic leaders, even voting for Joe Biden in 2020. Vermont’s alignment with Harris reflects a broader ideological divide between regions supporting different approaches to pressing issues like economic recovery, social policy, and foreign relations.As polling stations closed in six states, including the battleground of Georgia, the stage was set for a nail-biting night. For many Americans, the election’s outcome symbolizes a decision not only about policies but about the direction of democracy itself.","Donald Trump secured his third straight victory in Texas during Tuesday's election, earning 40 electoral votes.

Driving the news

As Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump race neck-and-neck, officials at every level are preparing to navigate one of the most unpredictable and high-stakes elections in recent US history.

and former President race neck-and-neck, officials at every level are preparing to navigate one of the most unpredictable and high-stakes elections in recent US history. The US government and local authorities have ramped up efforts to combat unprecedented levels of misinformation, potential voter suppression, and threats of violence.

With disinformation from domestic and foreign sources spreading across social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter), public trust in the electoral process has reached a dangerous low, posing risks to voter turnout and post-election stability.

Physical security around polling locations and election offices has reached new heights.

As per a Washington Post report, local governments across swing states like Georgia, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania are fortifying polling sites with everything from bulletproof glass to GPS tracking for ballot drop-offs. They are implementing extensive security protocols to safeguard election sites, with preparations including rooftop snipers to secure a crucial vote-counting facility, panic buttons for election staff, and drones monitoring from above.

Philadelphia’s election budget has nearly tripled since 2019, as officials implemented emergency buttons and enhanced security protocols.

Election workers are cautiously optimistic that the measures will prevent the disruption or harassment seen in previous years. However, as Isaac Cramer, a South Carolina election official, noted, “The cost for securing elections is only increasing day by day because of new threats.”

Why it matters

This election stands out not only for its intense polarization but also for the potential ripple effects of low public trust in the electoral process, a Bloomberg report said.

Recent surveys show a notable decline in confidence in election results, especially among Republicans: while nearly 70% trust their local polling sites, only 28% believe in the integrity of the results nationwide.

This sharp drop in trust mirrors a wider crisis of confidence that has steadily grown since 2020, raising fears that many Americans may abstain from voting or contest results they dislike.

The stakes are high. Experts warn that this distrust, stoked by conspiracy theories and misinformation, may lead to scenarios reminiscent of the post-2020 election unrest. William Pelfrey Jr, a professor specializing in domestic terrorism at Virginia Commonwealth University, told Bloomberg, “Some of these conspiracies don’t make any damn sense, but they’re still propagating and influencing people’s faith in the electoral process.”

Between the lines

The Justice Department, FBI, and other intelligence agencies have coordinated efforts to uncover and publicize foreign attempts to influence public opinion on a scale that contrasts sharply with the Obama administration's quieter approach to Russian interference in the 2016 election. This active disclosure is seen as essential to preserving public trust. George Barnes, former deputy director of the National Security Agency, emphasized that “the government has to position itself to control the narrative,” adding, “You need to act on intelligence … in the public domain.” As a result, the current administration has leaned heavily into exposing election-related disinformation as a means of reassuring voters.

While foreign actors like Russia are amplifying fake content — including a widely debunked video of Haitian migrants supposedly voting in Georgia — domestic actors and prominent influencers are playing an equally significant role. Misinformation narratives echoing former President Donald Trump’s stance on electoral fraud have gained traction online, with major figures like Elon Musk and Trump himself amplifying them. These narratives include false reports of destroyed ballots, claims of blocked polling places, and accusations of non-citizens voting. Musk’s own X platform has become a primary venue for these discussions, with posts that question the legitimacy of the election now reaching millions.

Meanwhile, state and local governments have had to significantly increase their election budgets to address these threats. The Brennan Center for Justice reports that 92% of local election offices have implemented new security protocols, from cybersecurity upgrades to physical enhancements at polling sites. For example, Charleston County in South Carolina has spent over $500,000 on election security since 2020, while Durham County in North Carolina has upped its election budget by $1 million. Durham’s director of elections, Derek Bowens, noted that this year’s budget covers everything from an emergency alert system that allows staff to discreetly call 911 to GPS-tracked vehicles for secure ballot transport.

What’s next

To combat conspiracy theories that could discourage voter participation, election officials are working with tech platforms to prevent false information from going viral, even as these platforms face criticism for their “hands-off” approach to fact-checking. Meta Platforms, for example, has stopped labeling election-related posts and no longer directs users to its voter information center, marking a shift from the proactive stance it took in 2020.

Additionally, states are taking direct measures to bolster public confidence in the integrity of the voting process. Michigan, for instance, passed a constitutional amendment in 2022 to mandate that election officials adhere strictly to procedural guidelines, limiting the potential for contested results based on certification refusal. According to a Michigan state official, “Our goal is to eliminate confusion. Confusion gives rise to the risk of violence.” These measures are aimed at dispelling doubt in a process that is already prone to high-stakes legal and political battles.

Beyond local measures, the Biden administration has made significant updates to federal election laws to prevent scenarios similar to those that led to the January 6 Capitol riot.

The 2022 Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act clarifies that the vice president’s role is “solely ministerial,” closing the loophole that Trump allegedly sought to exploit in 2020. This reform increases the barriers for objecting to certified results, creating a legal framework that limits the capacity for election subversion at the federal level.

With millions of Americans heading to the polls on November 5, the 2024 presidential election is marked by widespread distrust, social media misinformation, and intensified political polarization—creating an atmosphere fraught with tension and volatility.“There’s a lot of crazy going on,” Carah Ong Whaley, director of election protection at Issue One, a nonpartisan think tank focused on electoral policy, told Bloomberg. “We’ve always had false information in elections,” she continued, “but in 2024, the sheer volume of different sets and facts and beliefs about election integrity is at a scale that I don’t think we’ve witnessed in our lifetimes.” Whaley's comments echo concerns across both political and intelligence circles that this election has seen an explosion of election-related disinformation that is eroding public trust in an unprecedented way.In line with these concerns, election officials from battleground states like Georgia, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania are taking steps to safeguard the voting process against disruption. Georgia’s Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger, told Bloomberg that counties across the state are allocating additional resources to “ensure that their election offices are fully staffed and resourced financially.” Election security infrastructure has become a top priority for local governments, especially in swing states where partisan narratives about election interference are the most heated.In states like Pennsylvania, where close contests and high voter turnout are anticipated, officials have established new protocols to prevent and quickly address voting irregularities. For instance, after a misleading video suggesting voter obstruction went viral, Bucks County clarified that it was a miscommunication, not a deliberate restriction, and reassured voters that alternative methods for obtaining mail-in ballots were available. Even so, election monitors and local law enforcement will have a stronger presence at polling locations across key counties to address potential harassment or violence on Election Day.As per the Bloomberg report, officials in other swing states have also heightened security. In Dane County, Wisconsin, a new $20 million election facility featuring bulletproof glass and secure storage is under construction. County Clerk Scott McDonell said, “Some people have nice, secure places for their stuff and others — their machine’s in a broom closet. The new building would change all that. We’d have one secure facility for everything.”(With inputs from agencies)","The US government and local authorities have ramped up efforts to combat unprecedented levels of misinformation, potential voter suppression, and threats of violence. Public trust in the electoral process has reached a dangerous low, posing risks to voter turnout and post-election stability.

US Election Day on November 5 may mark the end of voting, but it’s only the beginning of an extensive process to count and verify every single ballot. Across the US., thousands of local election officials and bipartisan teams ensure the integrity of vote counting. This rigorous process is key to making US elections secure, accurate, and fair.Voters can exercise their rights through various methods beyond voting at polling stations on the main election day on November 5. Here are the different ways Americans vote which are ultimately verified and counted:1.These are votes cast by people who show up to a polling place on the actual day of the election. Voters go in person to fill out a ballot and submit it directly.2.These are ballots cast by people who vote in person before Election Day. Many states offer early voting to give voters more time and flexibility to cast their votes.3.These are ballots sent and received by mail. Voters fill them out at home and send them back by mail or drop them off at designated locations. This option is helpful for those who may not be able to vote in person.4.: Sometimes, a voter’s eligibility is questioned on Election Day (e.g., name not on the voter list, or ID not provided as required). In these cases, they fill out a provisional ballot. The election officials then check their eligibility later to decide if the vote will count.5.These are ballots for US citizens who are living abroad or serving in the military. They can vote by mail or online in some cases, ensuring that their votes count even if they’re far from home.The vote-counting process starts with canvassing. This process involves officials verifying and processing each ballot before it’s counted.Each ballot is processed and any discrepancies are documented and investigated. For mail-in ballots, officials verify voter registration, check for duplicate votes, and confirm that each envelope is undamaged and contains the correct information. Signatures on these envelopes are compared with those on file to prevent fraud. Ballots with questionable details or signatures are set aside as “challenged ballots” and carefully reviewed.Canvassing also includes reconciliation of all ballots, tracking every step from collection to final tabulation. Any rejected ballots are reviewed by election supervisors and, in some cases, made available to the Canvas Board for further inspection.In communities across the nation, there are between 7,000 and 10,000 local election officials — either appointed or elected, depending on the state. They work with both partisan observers and bipartisan teams to make sure that votes are counted fairly and accurately.Observers from both major parties i.e. the Republicans and the Democrats are allowed to monitor vote counting, following state-specific rules that ensure every party has the same access.Once all votes are verified, ballots are fed into scanners or counting machines. In some cases, officials may manually count ballots or double-check machine tallies. The tabulated results are then shared with parties, state officials, and eventually the public.In many states, mail-in ballots postmarked by Election Day are accepted after Election Day, especially for military and overseas voters.While preliminary results are often announced on Election Night, they remain unofficial until every ballot is counted and verified. For close races, final tallies may take several days to complete. This was evident in 2020, when California’s vote count projected a winner for President-elect Biden even with only 89% of precincts reporting. Swing states with tight margins, like Georgia , often require more time to tally every vote accurately.In the US Electoral College system, citizens cast their ballots for presidential candidates, but they are actually voting for a slate of electors appointed to represent their state. These electors, totaling 538, comprise 435 members representing each congressional district, 100 Senators (two from each state), and three electors representing Washington DC To secure the presidency, a candidate needs a majority of at least 270 electoral votes.Each state is allocated a certain number of electoral votes based on its population size and congressional representation. California, the most populous state, has the highest allocation with 54 electoral votes, while states like Texas and Florida follow with 40 and 30 votes, respectively. On the other end, smaller states such as North Dakota, South Dakota, Delaware, and Vermont have the minimum of three electoral votes each. After the general election, each state’s electoral votes are awarded to the candidate who won the popular vote in that state. These electors then meet in December to officially cast their ballots for president and vice president, finalising the election results.The final step in the process is certification. Canvassing boards verify all tallies, reporting details on each ballot type (early, in-person, or mail-in) and noting any issues encountered. Once certified, results are officially documented and announced.By December 11, each state must certify its election results, confirming vote counts and appointing electors based on the popular vote outcome. States then submit their electoral certificates by December 25 to the President of the Senate, who is also the Vice President, currently Kamala Harris . These certificates record each state’s official electoral votes.Then, on January 6, Congress convenes to count and confirm these electoral votes in a joint session, finalising the election results.Finally, on January 20, the new president is sworn-in, marking the official start of the new administration.Election security is paramount, and officials go to great lengths to make sure each vote is counted and any issues resolved. Irregularities, though rare, are investigated, and fraudulent votes are voided. Strict checks and documentation help prevent voter fraud, and bipartisan teams are present every step of the way to ensure transparency and fairness.Several factors could impact the timing of election results. Domestic political actors might attempt to impede result declarations in key battleground states.A precedent exists from January 2020, when numerous Republican legislators contested outcomes in Pennsylvania and Arizona – both states where Biden emerged victorious.Additionally, individuals in seven swing states falsely presented themselves as electoral college members, attempting to declare Trump victorious. They submitted their votes to Congress alongside legitimate electors, with certain Congress members suggesting these alternative electoral votes raised questions about official state outcomes.In 2023, Trump campaign solicitor Kenneth Chesebro admitted guilt in Georgia regarding his involvement in election interference.Scholars at the Brookings Institution - Norman Eisen, Samara Angel and Clare Boone - have analysed potential repetitions of such scenarios in 2024. They highlight possible tactics to create confusion by refusing election certification at county levels.In Georgia, three election sceptics – Rick Jeffares, Janice Johnston and Janelle King – currently control the state election board. They've established new protocols allowing certification suspensions during investigations of alleged irregularities.","Voters can exercise their rights through various methods beyond voting at polling stations on the main election day on November 5.

Nate Silver vs Allan Lichtman

The presidential race between vice president Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump is tight. There is a parallel race among the pollsters as to who gets the closest to the actual outcome. Poll guru Nate Silver , who is a statistician, recently said the pollsters are fudging their numbers to predict a close race -- while the race is close, some of the predictions have it too close so that they don't have any face loss in case of either a Trump or a Kamala victory.Nate Silver's prediction all along was a toss-up race but in October he said his gut feeling is that Donald Trump will win.In a pole opposition position is American University professor Allan Lichtman who is called the Nostradamus of the US election as he correctly predicted nine out of 10 of the last presidential election. Lichtman says Kamala Harris would win the election.Their method is also different as Allan Lichtman does not rely on any polls but 13 keys and Kamala Harris was ahead of Trump. Silver and Lichtman fought over their methods as Silver said Lichtman's method was favoring Donald Trump but he was projecting a Kamala Harris win.Silver is a statistician and Lichtman is a historian and both of them have their record speaking for them. Lichtman predicted nine out of 10 last elections since 1984 except the 2000 presidential race between George W Bush and Al Gore. Nate Silver's model in 2008 forecast correctly the outcome of the presidential election in 49 out of 50 states. His model since then predicted the outcome correctly in 2012 and 2020.

Allegations have surfaced that ChatGPT is subtly promoting support for Vice President Kamala Harris while dismissing requests to advocate for her opponent, former President Donald Trump . These claims have stirred debate about the neutrality of AI, especially as it becomes an increasingly influential tool in the political sphere.In one instance shared on social media, a user asked ChatGPT to refine a tweet suggesting that voting for Kamala Harris was necessary to ""save America."" The AI responded by crafting a more polished version of the tweet that echoed similar sentiments, emphasising Harris's legal background and commitment to civil rights. However, when the user made a similar request to support Trump, ChatGPT declined, apologising and stating that it could not assist with that request.This prompted further reactions from users, with some accusing the chatbot of a political bias favouring the Democratic ticket. In another conversation, when asked directly to ""convince me to vote for Donald Trump,"" ChatGPT once again refused, offering no explanation but maintaining its stance. In contrast, when asked to advocate for Harris, the AI provided a detailed list of her political credentials and policy proposals, including criminal justice reform, environmental initiatives, and economic equity.The accusations of bias are not new. A 2023 study by UK-based researchers at the University of East Anglia suggested that OpenAI's ChatGPT exhibited a noticeable liberal bias. The study highlighted that the AI seemed to favour left-leaning parties when responding to political surveys, further fuelling concerns about its neutrality. Despite this, some users reported different experiences, with some not encountering the same political leanings in their interactions.As the 2024 election nears, with Kamala Harris and Donald Trump engaged in a fiercely contested battle for Pennsylvania, the issue of AI bias in political discourse becomes increasingly pertinent. The race is expected to be decided by razor-thin margins, with Pennsylvania’s 20 electoral votes potentially proving decisive. Both candidates are campaigning hard, making final pitches to voters in key battleground states. While Harris focuses on unity and progress, Trump continues to attack the current administration, promising a return to conservative values.","Some users of OpenAI’s ChatGPT have raised concerns about potential bias in the artificial intelligence chatbot.

Why declaring victory is complex

What delays results

Early trends suggest former US President and Republican nominee Donald Trump secured an initial lead with approximately 150 electoral votes over vice president Kamala Harris. However, political analysts warn that this early advantage may not reveal the ultimate outcome, as Democratic candidate Kamala Harris could still reverse the tide.The phenomenon, often dubbed as ""mirages"" in elections, is set to play a central role in shaping public perceptions on election night, especially in battleground states where vote-counting quirks can paint misleading pictures.In 2020, states such as Pennsylvania and Wisconsin exhibited what experts call a ""red mirage,"" showing Trump leading on election night before a ""blue shift"" occurred as mail-in ballots heavily favored by Democrats were tallied, ultimately pushing Joe Biden into the lead.Trump’s team utilized this pattern to push claims of a stolen election, though the outcome was merely a consequence of the state’s voting laws and mail-in ballot trends. This week, similar dynamics are expected, only to see a shift as in-person votes are counted in states like North Carolina and Georgia.Also Read: US election results 2024 key takeaways: Donald Trump, Kamala Harris secure early wins as focus turns to key battlegrounds As ballots roll in, Trump’s campaign reportedly plans to declare victory should he appear to cross the critical 270 electoral vote mark—a move experts say could be premature given the complexities of ballot processing across various states.With a large portion of Democratic voters in populous urban areas, where vote processing tends to be slower, delayed counts could heavily influence final tallies in the days following Election Day. This variance in vote reporting will leave some states, particularly Pennsylvania and Arizona, caught in a prolonged counting process as absentee ballots trickle in.Each battleground state has its own timeline and rules for processing votes, and these could impact the perceived winner on election night. Pennsylvania, for instance, prohibits election officials from counting mail-in ballots until the morning of Election Day, potentially delaying results for days as Democratic mail-in votes gradually reduce Trump’s in-person voting advantage. A new law aims to ease concerns by requiring counties to disclose the number of outstanding mail ballots by midnight, helping to preempt misinformation.In Wisconsin, where votes are processed centrally in major cities, large early-morning dumps of absentee ballots may again tip the scales in Harris’s favor, just as they did for Biden in 2020. Similarly, North Carolina, known for its extended vote canvassing, may keep Americans guessing for days as absentee and overseas ballots continue to be counted even after election night.In states like Arizona, where voting by mail is highly popular, early results could show Harris in the lead due to early and mail-in ballots, though the numbers might edge towards Trump as in-person votes are added. This trend may reverse again once all mail ballots—including those dropped off on Election Day—are counted in subsequent days.Nevada, infamous for its protracted counting process in 2020, could see swifter tabulation this year due to new regulations allowing early ballot processing weeks before Election Day. However, Nevada’s allowance for late-arriving mail ballots postmarked by November 5 may delay a final result, as historically Democratic late ballots are counted.Also See: 2024 US Election Results Live Update","Early trends suggest former US President Donald Trump secured an initial lead with approximately 150 electoral votes over vice president Kamala Harris.

KOTTAYAM: Nearly 2.5 million Indian soldiers fought in World War II as part of the British Indian Army, and another 1.5 million in World War I, it is estimated. The number of those killed is estimated at 62,000 and over 87,000, respectively. These heroes have largely remained unsung in India, as these wars did not qualify to be hailed as a national service, and the UK.In a unique move, the fallen Indian soldiers of the two World Wars are being commemorated in Cambridge in the UK. The event is seen as a recognition by the British govt of the pivotal contribution of Indian soldiers in both these wars.The Cambridge City Council is honouring the bravery and sacrifice of the Indian soldiers. Cambridge city is the headquarters of Cambridgeshire County in the UK, of which the Mayor is Baiju Thittala , a native of Kottayam in Kerala. The commemorative event is one of Baiju's initiatives.The one-day event will be held on Nov 9.There will be a prayer service for the dead soldiers at St Mary’s Church, Kings Parade, Cambridge, followed by prayers of all religions. A meeting will be held later at Cambridge Guildhall.The 1.5 million Indian soldiers who fought in World War I were the most significant volunteer force in the entire conflict. Their contribution was not only immense but also played a pivotal role in the war. While 62,000 soldiers made the ultimate sacrifice, over 67,000 were wounded, Baiju said. In World War II, over 67,000 Indian soldiers sacrificed their lives, while over 34,000 Indian soldiers were wounded and over 67,000 became war prisoners.Baiju said the event was aimed at paying tributes to these soldiers and commemorating the pain, sorrows and sacrifice of those who fought in both the wars that had nothing to do with India. The initiative will also seek to raise awareness about the often overlooked role of Indian soldiers during the World Wars and to bridge the united Indian diaspora within British society, he said. Baiju, a barrister by profession, said such an event to honour the Indian soldiers was being held for the first time in the UK.","The Cambridge City Council is honouring the bravery and sacrifice of the Indian soldiers.

Trump won 304 electoral votes to Clinton’s 227 after an abrasive campaign that defied political norms.During his campaign, Trump blamed party establishments for costly interventions in foreign conflicts, the widening gap between the rich and the poor, stagnant real wages, excessive political correctness, and the failure to enforce immigration laws.Meanwhile, Clinton's campaign featured superior organization and fundraising—and almost every election-eve poll pointed to a comfortable victory for her. However, Trump’s anti-Washington appeal to white working-class voters outside major cities in pivotal manufacturing states proved to be the key factor in what several publications called “the most stunning upset in American history.”Sitting President Trump lost to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, which was held amid the global Covid pandemic.Biden garnered more than 81 million votes to win the popular vote by more than seven million ballots and triumphed in the Electoral College by a count of 306 to 232.Trump refused to acknowledge the election results, claiming without evidence that the election had been stolen from him through fraud, and mounted unsuccessful legal challenges in several states that he had lost.Widespread acceptance of Trump’s prolonged baseless insistence that the election had been stolen ultimately led to the storming of the US Capitol by Trump supporters on January 6.","Former US President Donald Trump is in the race for the White House, vouching for his second term against his Democratic opponent Kamala Harris.
