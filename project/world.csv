His presence at the event and praise for the TMC supremo have sparked strong reactions within the BJP, with now Swapan Dasgupta calling the move a “betrayal”.""The outrage among grassroots BJP Bengal workers at this apparent betrayal by a former state president is too deafening for the national leadership to ignore,"" Dasgupta wrote on X.The controversy comes at a time when BJP is actively trying to push Mamata Banerjee in a corner over Murshidabad communal violence. Ghosh attended the temple event on Wednesday and later spoke with Banerjee, pictures and videos of which have been widely shared on social media.On the other hand, leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari skipped the programme altogether, choosing instead to address a religious gathering in Contai, just a few kilometres away from Digha. Bengal BJP chief Sukanta Majumdar distanced the party from Ghosh’s actions, calling his visit a “personal decision” that the party did not endorse.Ghosh, who visited the temple with his wife, said there was no party directive barring attendance, and even if there had been, he would not have followed it. ""I like to visit temples, and the party cannot bar me from paying tribute to Lord Jagannath. Even if there was any whip, I would not have paid heed to it,"" he said. He also described the state government’s invitation as an ""honour"" and said that temple visits were part of Hindu cultural life.In contrast, Majumdar pointed to the recent violence in Murshidabad, saying the BJP had collectively decided not to attend the temple’s inauguration in protest. Adhikari declined to comment directly on Ghosh, stating only that he responds to remarks or actions by Mamata Banerjee.The divergence in approaches has led to criticism from some party leaders, including MP Saumitra Khan, who took to social media to attack Ghosh’s decision.

Barely two months later, their relationship got strained and her parents and relatives came to the man's home and abused him and his family in filthy language and insulted him by calling him 'impotent' and infertile.

Condemn attack, revive direct talks: Rubio to Pak

NEW DELHI: The US stepped in to prevent any military conflict between India and Pakistan over the Pahalgam terrorist attack as it asked both countries to avoid any flare-up and work for peace. India has been weighing punitive measures against Pakistan for its cross-border adventurism, but secretary of state Marco Rubio “encouraged” India in a phone conversation with counterpart S Jaishankar to work with Pakistan to de-escalate tensions and maintain peace and security in South Asia.There was no readout of the talks from the Indian side but Jaishankar himself said in a laconic post on X after his talks with Rubio that the perpetrators, backers and planners of the terrorist attack must be brought to justice. Rubio had spoken to Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif before his talks with Jaishankar and urged Pakistani officials’ cooperation in investigating “this unconscionable attack”. The state department’s Hindi account on X said in a post on Thursday evening that under US President Donald Trump those who support terrorism will have to face consequences.“The Secretary expressed his sorrow for the lives lost in the horrific terrorist attack in Pahalgam and reaffirmed the United States’ commitment to cooperation with India against terrorism,’’ said the US readout.The state department readout of the Rubio conversations seemed carefully worded as it said in the case of Pakistan that while urging it to work with India for peace, Rubio asked Sharif to “re-establish direct communications” but avoided the same in the Rubio-Jaishankar readout. The secretary spoke to Sharif about the need to condemn the Pahalgam terror attack , something that Pakistan has not done except at the UN Security Council where it joined others as a non-permanent member to condemn the attack but not before working to dilute the statement with help from China.According to the state department, Rubio and Sharif reaffirmed their “continued commitment” to holding terrorists accountable for their heinous acts of violence. Rubio had last month too in a conversation with Pakistan foreign minister Ishaq Dar underscored the importance of continued cooperation on counterterrorism between the US and Pakistan, while thanking Pakistan for the arrest and transfer to the US of ISIS-K operative Mohammad Sharifullah. The 2 countries also plan to hold a counterterrorism dialogue in June this year.Rubio was said to be encouraging other foreign ministers too to work with India and Pakistan to defuse tensions and his conversation with Jaishankar followed statements by powerful Gulf States like Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which also have strong ties with both countries, asking them to exercise restraint.US President Donad Trump had strongly condemned the Pahalgam attack and expressed full support to India to bring to justice the perpetrators. However, he later also said he’s close to both India and Pakistan and that they’ll themselves “get it figured out one way or the other”.","The US stepped in to prevent any military conflict between India and Pakistan over the Pahalgam terrorist attack.

Police said he is wanted in a case registered in Budgam under UAPA sections 10, 13, and 39, which relate to membership of unlawful associations, involvement in unlawful activities, and support to a banned terrorist organisation, respectively.Police said Fai is “concealing himself in the US”, and has “persistently evaded arrest, obstructing the legal process and avoiding accountability under the law”.On July 19, 2011 the US Federal Bureau of Investigation had arrested Fai, along with a Pakistani American, Zaheer Ahmad. They were charged with falsifying, concealing and covering up material facts as they lobbied with US govt without disclosing that they were being funded by Pakistan govt, including its spy agency ISI.On Dec 7, 2011, a statement by the US department of justice said Fai had “pleaded guilty to conspiracy and tax violations in connection with a decades-long scheme to conceal the transfer of at least $3.5 million from the govt of Pakistan to fund his lobbying efforts in America related to Kashmir”. The statement further said: “Fai served as the director of the Kashmiri American Council (KAC), a non-governmental organisation in Washington, D.C., that held itself out to be run by Kashmiris, financed by Americans and dedicated to raising the level of knowledge in the United States about the struggle of the Kashmiri people for self-determination. But according to court documents, KAC was secretly funded by officials employed by the govt of Pakistan, including the ISI directorate.”In March 2012, a US court sentenced him to two years in prison for a “conspiracy to defraud the US”. However, in Nov 2013 he was released by the Federal Correctional Institution in Cumberland, Maryland, as the court reduced his sentence to 16 months.","Ghulam Nabi Fai, secretary general of Washington D.C.-based World Kashmir Awareness Forum, was declared a proclaimed offender (PO) under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967.

A distant relative, he claims, manipulated authorities to serve deportation notices to him and eight of his siblings — all in an alleged bid to seize their ancestral property of 17 acres in J&K Poonch district.“I think a revenue official, who is our distant relative, influenced the authorities and they sent us notices without confirmation. He wanted to grab my land. It should be investigated,” Ali said Thursday. “How can a conspiracy driven by greed for land rob me of my children, my country, and put us to such agony?”The 45-year-old head constable posted at the Vaishno Devi shrine’s Katra base camp was on official duty in Jammu on April 26 when he was handed a deportation order by local police. The notice, issued by the Poonch DC, directed him and his siblings — three brothers and five sisters, all between 45 and 65 — to leave India by April 29 and cross into Pakistan.“The notice was in my hand and suddenly, from a police officer I became a person without a country,” Ali said.The orders followed the Centre’s directive to identify and deport Pakistani nationals in the wake of the April 22 terrorist attack in Pahalgam. Somehow, despite his govt job and decades of residency, Ali’s name was included.His department intervened, sparing him from immediate deportation and keeping him at Gandhi Nagar police station in Jammu. His siblings, however, were put on the road to the Attari border in Punjab. At home, his wife Shahnaz Kousar and their three children — 12-year-old Nawaish, 9-year-old Ayaan, and 7-year-old Ziyaan — were left in anguish.“I cannot describe how I have spent the past seven days. I was living a hell,” Ali said. “When a man dies, he is buried in a grave. Here I am alive and I was thinking I couldn’t be with my children ever.”Ali’s roots in India run deep. His father Faqir Din was a hereditary state subject and an Indian citizen under the 1955 Citizenship Act. During the 1965 war, Din and his family were forced into PoK when their village Salwah came under Pakistani control. There, six more children, including Iftkhar, were born. The family returned to J&K in the 1980s and were officially granted state subject status in 1997.On April 29, J&K high court stayed the deportation. “Outside the police station in Poonch on Thursday evening, I felt back in life,” Ali said. “I am happy now, but will the trauma of this week live with us for long?”","J&K police head constable Iftkhar Ali believes it was a land dispute that nearly tore apart his life, his family, and his identity as an Indian citizen.

How Signal app may led to NSA Mike Waltz’s dismissal

Signal app, which became the centre of a national security controversy involving a high-ranking official in the Trump administration, appears to have directly led to significant consequences for US National Security Adviser Mike Waltz. Citing people familier with the matter, CNN reports that President Trump is expected to remove Waltz from his position in the coming days. The trouble began when it was discovered that Waltz was a participant in a group conversation on the app which was used to discuss highly sensitive military operations, specifically planned strikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen. A major breach of security occurred when a journalist was accidentally included in this conversation.The report said that Waltz's position became indefensible after he ‘mistakenly’ included the editor of The Atlantic in a Signal group chat discussing highly sensitive military strikes. This incident led to Trump considering his dismissal, though he initially didn’t do it “because he [Trump] didn’t want to provide his enemies a perceived victory”.However, Waltz's standing within the West Wing never fully recovered, and his influence waned, particularly with Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, the report added. This would be the first major staff shakeup of Trump's second term.The Signal incident proved to be a critical factor in Trump's decision.“President Trump lost confidence in him a while ago,” an administration official told the publication. Trump reportedly couldn't move past how Waltz added a journalist to the chat.The incident also reportedly highlighted a double standard, as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who also shared sensitive information on Signal, is not facing dismissal. Trump believed Hegseth should be retained after a difficult confirmation process, and he enjoys greater support from the MAGA base.Meanwhile, Democrats on Capitol Hill criticised Trump's decision, arguing that Hegseth’s actions were more serious.",US National Security Adviser Mike Waltz is expected to be dismissed.

Columbia University student Mohsen Mahdawi was released from ICE custody following an order from US district judge Geoffrey Crawford. Immediately after coming out of the Vermont courtroom, Mahdawi said, ""I am saying it clear and loud to President Trump and his Cabinet: I am not afraid of you.""Mahdawi is a 34-year-old student, a legal permanent resident for 10 years.

China has said it is open to trade negotiations with the United States but warned that talks cannot proceed unless Washington shows genuine intent by reversing its unilateral tariff measures.According to news agency Associated Press, the statement, issued Friday by China’s commerce ministry, said that Beijing is currently assessing several approaches made by the Trump administration to reinitiate discussions. But it stressed that one-sided tariff hikes—some reaching 145%—will have to go.“China's position is consistent. If we fight, we will fight to the end; if we talk, the door is open. The tariff and trade wars were unilaterally initiated by the US. If the US side wants to talk, it should show its sincerity and be ready to correct wrong practices, including cancelling the unilateral imposition of tariffs,” the ministry said, quoting an unnamed spokesperson.According to the statement, senior US officials have recently conveyed, through intermediaries, a willingness to engage in discussions. China has acknowledged these attempts but cautioned that simply expressing interest is not enough.The US “says one thing but does another,” the spokesperson said, adding that China would not respond to any attempt at coercion or ""blackmail under the guise of talks"".In retaliation to US president Donald Trump’s tariff hikes, China raised import duties on US goods to as high as 125%, restricted exports of key minerals, and halted imports of a range of American agricultural products.","China has said it is open to trade negotiations with the United States.

Israel conducted an airstrike near Syria's presidential palace during the early hours of Friday, following their warning to Syrian authorities regarding movements towards villages populated by a minority sect in southern Syria.The strike occurred after several days of violent encounters between pro-government forces and Druze minority fighters near Damascus, resulting in numerous casualties and injuries. Syria's Druze spiritual leader has condemned a ""genocidal campaign"" against his community after sectarian clashes killed 102 people.Israel sees the new forces in Syria as jihadists and has warned them to protect the Druze minority, with defence minister Israel Katz saying his country could otherwise respond ""with significant force"". The violence poses a serious challenge to the Islamist authorities in Syria who ousted longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in December.This Friday's attack, the second Israeli strike on Syria this week, targeted an area near the presidential palace, seemingly conveying a stern message to Syria's new Islamist leadership, primarily controlled by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham .Sheikh Hikmat Al-Hijri, the Druze spiritual leader, on Thursday severely condemned the Syrian government for what he termed an ""unjustified genocidal attack"" on their community.According to the Israeli military's statement, their fighter jets targeted an area adjacent to President Hussein al-Sharaa's Palace in Damascus, without providing additional information.Syrian pro-government media reported that the strike landed near the People's Palace situated on a hill overlooking Damascus.The conflict ignited around midnight Monday following the circulation of an audio recording on social media containing criticism of Islam's Prophet Muhammad, attributed to a Druze cleric. However, cleric Marwan Kiwan denied responsibility for the controversial audio in a social media video.Syria's information ministry confirmed 11 security personnel deaths in two separate incidents, while The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported 56 fatalities in Sahnaya and Jaramana, including local fighters and security forces.The Druze religious community, which emerged as a 10th-century offshoot of Ismailism within Shiite Islam, comprises approximately one million members worldwide, with over half residing in Syria, primarily in Sweida province and Damascus suburbs.The remaining Druze population is distributed between Lebanon and Israel, including the Golan Heights, which Israel seized from Syria during the 1967 Mideast War and subsequently annexed in 1981.","Israel conducted an airstrike near Syria's presidential palace during the early hours of Friday.

Mike Waltz out: Inside Donald Trump’s sudden shakeup and the scandal that took down his security adviser,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/mike-waltz-out-inside-donald-trumps-sudden-shakeup-and-the-scandal-that-took-down-his-security-adviser/articleshow/120807537.cms,"Who is Mike Waltz?

Why Mike Waltz was replaced?



US President Donald Trump on Thursday announced the replacement of national security adviser Mike Waltz, stating that he would be nominated as the next ambassador to the United Nations.In the first major cabinet reshuffle, just over 100 days into his new term, following a string of controversies and internal tensions the President named secretary of state Marco Rubio as interim national security adviser.""From his time in uniform on the battlefield, in Congress and, as my National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz has worked hard to put our Nation's Interests first,"" Trump posted on Truth Social while announcing the changes.""I'm deeply honoured to continue my service to President Trump and our great nation,"" Waltz responded in a post on X.Born in Boynton Beach, Florida, Waltz is the son and grandson of Navy chiefs. He was raised by a single mother and is known for his military and national security background.Before entering politics, he worked in the Pentagon and served in the White House under President George W Bush.Waltz was elected to Congress in 2018, representing Florida’s 6th District. He became the first Green Beret ever elected to the US House and served on key committees including Intelligence, Armed Services, and Foreign Affairs.He also joined the House China Task Force and was known for his strong anti-China policies. Trump appointed Waltz as national security adviser in November, praising him as a respected defense expert.Waltz’s exit came in the wake of the so-called ""Signal gate"" scandal that erupted in March. The former congressman from Florida and retired Green Beret mistakenly added Atlantic magazine editor Jeffrey Goldberg to a private Signal group chat that included top US security officials.The group was reportedly discussing sensitive military plans, including potential US airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen, according to several reports.During his final cabinet meeting, Waltz was photographed checking his phone, and a zoomed-in image showed an ongoing Signal conversation with a contact saved as ""JD Vance""—the current US Vice President.The message read: “I have confirmation from my counterpart it’s turned off. He is going to be here in…” It remains unclear whether Waltz or Vance sent the message, the Daily Beast reported.The leak raised serious concerns about operational security. It also exposed a broader pattern of questionable digital communication among senior officials.Defense secretary Pete Hegseth is also under scrutiny for allegedly sharing military flight details in another Signal chat that included his wife.Multiple sources told BBC that Waltz’s handling of the National Security Council staff and the leak were key reasons for his removal.While Trump publicly supported Waltz, insiders said he had lost confidence in him and wanted a quieter way to remove him. By nominating Waltz to a high-profile role like UN ambassador, Trump avoided the optics of firing him outright, the outlet added.Despite the abrupt end to his tenure, Vance insisted the move to the UN post was a promotion and had nothing to do with the Signal controversy.Still, Democrats are calling for further accountability. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer has urged action against Defense Secretary Hegseth, tweeting: “Now do Hegseth.”Waltz’s 101-day stint as national security adviser is now the second-shortest in US history—just behind Michael Flynn’s three-week tenure in Trump’s first term.","Mike Waltz will be nominated as the next ambassador to the United Nations.

Vance downplays the fallout

Inside operation rough rider

What's next for Waltz?

Vice President JD Vance insists there’s no scandal behind Mike Waltz’s sudden exit as National Security Adviser, despite growing buzz around a Signal group chat gone wrong.Speaking to Fox News, Vance said Waltz has the “trust of both myself and President Trump” and framed his nomination as US Ambassador to the United Nations as a strategic move, not a demotion.“I think you could make a good argument that it’s a promotion,” Vance told Special Report. “We brought Mike on to do some serious reforms at the National Security Council. He has done that.”Waltz, a former Florida congressman and Green Beret, joined the White House just four months ago—leaving his House seat to take the powerful NSA role. But controversy followed him quickly.In late March, Waltz created a Signal group chat titled “Houthi PC small group” to coordinate discussions about pending strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen.The chat included top Trump administration officials like Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, DNI Tulsi Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, and Vance himself. But it also, inadvertently, included an outsider: The Atlantic’s editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg.The mix-up meant a journalist had access to messages in which Hegseth shared sensitive, if not technically classified, information about the timing of US military operations. Hegseth, a former Fox & Friends Weekend co-host, maintains nothing shared in the chat was classified.Still, Democrats and defense officials expressed disbelief, arguing that operational details about targets and strikes would almost certainly qualify as classified. The Pentagon’s acting inspector general has since launched an investigation into Hegseth’s use of Signal for military coordination.Vance insists the incident, now dubbed “Signalgate”, had nothing to do with Waltz’s departure. He called the controversy a “nothingburger” and argued the move is about aligning talent to mission.“This isn’t about a scandal,” Vance told anchor Bret Baier. “The president believes Waltz would do a better job in a different role.”Even so, the messages in the Signal chat shed light on internal disagreements within the administration. Vance himself voiced concerns about the Yemen strikes, warning the team that the military action risked appearing inconsistent with Trump’s broader foreign policy message, especially the push for European allies to take more responsibility for their own defense.“I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now,” Vance wrote in the group chat. “There’s a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.”Vance later told Fox that the exchange reflects positively on his leadership style. “I think that’s what a good national security team should do,” he said, referring to open debate before decisive action.The Yemen strikes are part of Operation Rough Rider, a US campaign now in its 40th day. According to CENTCOM, over 800 Houthi targets have been hit since the start of the operation. The strikes have killed hundreds of fighters and senior figures, including officials responsible for missile and drone operations.Vance defended the campaign, saying it underscores Trump’s commitment to protecting U.S. shipping lanes and commercial interests.“If you load stuff onto a ship and you send it to the United States,” Vance said, “we want to make sure it shows up without the sailors getting killed, without the ship being destroyed. And that is an objective that we're going to pursue forcefully, if we have to.”Waltz’s nomination to the UN now heads to the Senate, where some lawmakers are expected to question him on the Signal incident and his role in the Yemen operation. But for now, the Trump administration is standing by him—arguing his reassignment is a strategic move, not a political casualty.","Vice President JD Vance says Mike Waltz's departure from NSA is not a demotion.

The segment went off the rails when Navarro, defending migrants, made a clumsy comparison that invoked slavery, drawing swift and sharp rebuke from Singleton.“There’s a hell of a lot of people, other than the Black people who were brought here as slaves, who came to this country illegally,” Navarro began, before Singleton cut in, “They are not the same as Black people who were brought here against our will,” he snapped.What followed was several minutes of back-and-forth that moderator Abby Phillip struggled to contain.“No, he purposely misheard it,” Navarro jabbed.“I purposely misheard? So now you're in my brain?” Singleton fired back.“That's right. I'm Latino. And my people are being racially profiled,” Navarro retorted.“Great. Last time I checked, I’m Black. You’re not,” Singleton said, growing visibly frustrated.Phillip’s repeated attempts to de-escalate the tension fell flat as the shouting continued off-camera even as the segment ended.But the drama didn’t stop there.The conversation heated up again over Trump’s claim that Abrego Garcia had MS-13 tattoos—something Navarro challenged.“Are you saying the Photoshop is true?” she asked Scott Jennings , who had argued that Democrats were committing political suicide by defending someone “affiliated with a transnational terrorist organization.”Jennings doubled down:“He was elected to protect us from MS-13. That’s what he’s doing.”Navarro pushed back hard, saying, “What Trump said yesterday was an absolute lie.”The segment also featured CNN columnist Raul Reyes, who cited polling that showed “54% of Americans want Mr Abrego Garcia back.” Jennings dismissed the claim amid crosstalk and reminded the panel that Trump was elected to crack down on illegal immigration.“We let 20 million people into the country, and now we can’t deport someone because we have to go through ‘years of paperwork’?” he asked.The panel’s implosion, complete with visible tension, racial identity arguments, and fierce ideological division, reflected the broader national debate on immigration in the Trump era.

'I can not speak for the action of other members'



Is Thanedar trying to raise money through his impeachment attempt?



Several House Democrats distanced themselves from Shri Thanedar's articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump. They were initially part of the impeachment attempt as they signed as co-sponsors of the resolution.Reps. Kweisi Mfume (Maryland), Robin Kelly (Illinois) and Jerry Nadler (New York) had signed on as co-sponsors of Rep. Shri Thanedar’s (D-Mich.) impeachment resolution — which includes seven articles of impeachment — but Tuesday afternoon, they went to the House floor and asked for their names to be taken off the legislation. The House clerk granted their request.The reason for their withdrawal revealed a strange aspect of the impeachment articles that Thanedar brought. Spokespeople for Kelly and Mfume said the lawmakers initially signed on to the effort because they assumed it had been reviewed by leadership. Later they learnt that it was not reviewed by the leadership and hence they asked for their names to be removed, the Hill reported.“Congressman Mfume removed himself as a cosponsor from H. Res. 353 because he was made aware it was not cleared by Democratic leadership and not fully vetted legally — and he preferred to err on the side of caution,” the spokesperson for Mfume said.“The Congresswoman was under the impression that the resolution was drafted and reviewed by both the House Judiciary Committee and Leadership when she originally signed on during a vote series on the floor,” Kelly’s spokesperson echoed.Reacting to the withdrawal of the names of the co-sponsors, Thanedar said he can not speak for the actions of other members. ""I am doing this because Trump has blatantly violated the Constitution,"" he said. The chair of the House Democratic Caucus Rep. Pete Aguilar (Calif.), said trying to remove Trump from office “is not an exercise the party is willing to undertake as the GOP is in the total control of Congress.MAGA activist Laura Loomer claimed that Shri Thandera is hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign debt and the only reason he brought the articles of impeachment against Trumpp is to fundraise his way out of the debt.","Reps.

Watch: US official says Trump saved 258 million lives in first 100 days; JD Vance's expression goes viral,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-us-official-says-trump-saved-258-million-lives-in-first-100-days-jd-vances-expression-goes-viral/articleshow/120803120.cms,"JD Vance's expression at the Cabinet meeting is going viral.

As all cabinet members on Wednesday were heaping praises on President Donald Trump as his administration crossed the first landmark of the first 100 days, Attorney General Pam Bondi went overboard as she said Trump has saved 258 million lives, which is equivalent to 75 per cent of the US population . The claim stunned many social media users but they pointed out that vice president JD Vance , who was sitting beside her, was equally bewildered by her claim.""President, you first 100 days has far exceeded that of ANY other presidency in this country. Ever. Ever. Never seen anything like it. Thank you,"" Pam Bondi said.""34,000 kilos of fentanyl, since you've been - your last 100 days. Which saved, are you ready for this media? 258 million lives,"" Bondi said. Kids are dying every day because they're taking this junk, laced with something else they don't know what they're taking. They think they're buying a Tylenol or an Adderall and a Xanax and it's laced with fentanyl and they're dropping dead and no longer because of you, what you've done,"" Pam Bondi said. On Tuesday, she wrote on X that the fetanyl seizures had seven over 119 million lives.Pam Bondi provided a formula to The Daily Beast for how she arrived at the figure. ""3,400,000 grams of fentanyl multiplied by the “current purity level” of .1518, divided by .002, the lethal amount per gram. The result: 258,060,000,"" the report said.But JD Vance's facial expression said it all, social media users noted, as JD Vance was seen doing mental math when Pam Bondi announced the figure.""The US population is 340.1 million people, ~33 million are under 10. So he save the lives of ~84% of those of us over 10 years old,"" one wrote.One X user pointed out that Pam Bondi did not say American lives and by the volume of the fentanyl, she was correct.""Vance realizing some MAGA math happened somewhere,"" one person commented. ""You can see whats left of JD's logical brain fighting for its life,"" a second person wrote.","Attorney General Pam Bondi said Trump has saved 258 million lives.

"Pahalgama attack aftermath: Pakistan shuts Wagah gate, leaves its citizens stranded",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pahalgama-attack-aftermath-pakistan-shuts-wagah-gate-leaves-its-citizens-stranded/articleshow/120803489.cms,"ATTARI: Pakistan refused Thursday to open the gates at Wagah border post across Punjab's Attari, leaving dozens of its people and those deported from India stranded in the no-man's-land of diplomatic deadlock.No Pakistani nationals were allowed to cross the border, Indian officials said, though Afghan trucks were granted entry into India. Pakistan's foreign ministry cited ""brotherly relations"" with Afghanistan for the exception, highlighting the selective nature of the border movement.Pakistan had allowed its nationals to return until April 29, but by Thursday, the gates remained closed, deepening a standoff that has left families torn between two countries - forced to bear the consequences of a visa suspension following the April 20 terrorist attack in Pahalgam.Among them were two elderly sisters, unsure of where they belong - or where they'll be allowed to go. For Saeeda Sagir Fatima and Saeeda Jameer Fatima, born in Lahore but long settled in Srinagar, the closed gate came as a reprieve from what they feared would be a forced exile.The two, physically frail and clutching bags packed for a one-way trip, had lived in India for over 40 years after entering legally with passports and visas.Despite years of appeals and a court order, their applications for Indian citizenship were denied. Saeeda Sagir, who is physically disabled, wept.""Who will take us in there?"" she asked, referring to Pakistan. ""May our final breath be on Indian soil, and may we be laid to rest here.""Just yards away, the same closed gate brought anguish to two Indian sisters. Sharmin and Shakeela, who live in Karachi after marrying Pakistani men more than a decade ago, were unable to return home. They had travelled to India on March 27 to see their critically ill mother and were told they could re-enter Pakistan on May 1.""It was surprising and shocking to find out that the border gates were closed,"" Sharmin said. Holding Indian passports and accompanied by their children, the sisters waited helplessly. Their brother Mohammad Shariq, who came to bid them farewell, said their lives - and their families - were rooted across the border areas.Adding to the uncertainty, a group of Pakistani labourers, mostly Hindus who had been working in Rajasthan, also awaited return. They were instructed to leave India after the Pahalgam attack, despite having no links to the violence.""We came here for finding work, not trouble,"" said Ganesh, one of the labourers. ""Now we are being sent back to nothing. As minorities in Pakistan, our lives are harder than ever.""Local porters and Sikh volunteers from a nearby gurdwara stepped in to help, offering langar - free meals and water - to those stranded on the border.","No Pakistani nationals were allowed to cross the border, though Afghan trucks were granted entry into India.

"Amid drumbeats of war, Pakistan appoints ISI chief Asim Malik as NSA",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/amid-drumbeats-of-war-pakistan-appoints-isi-chief-asim-malik-as-nsa/articleshow/120802745.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistani spy agency ISI’s director general, Lt Gen Muhammad Asim Malik, was appointed Thursday as the country’s national security adviser (NSA), reinforcing the military’s primacy in security and political strategy amid the heightened possibility of war with India. Even in a country where the military has always loomed over governance, this is the first time that the ISI head will also officiate as NSA.The appointment, effective immediately, comes less than 10 days after the April 22 terrorist attack on tourists in J&K’s Pahalgam that put Pakistan in India’s crosshairs and triggered a diplomatic firestorm.Lt Gen Malik, who took over as ISI chief in Sept 2024, will advise PM Shehbaz Sharif on national security and foreign policy while steering Pakistan’s intelligence apparatus. The dual role, announced via a cabinet division notification, is widely seen as a power grab by the military, sidelining the civilian leadership at a time of reckoning.Pakistan’s denial of involvement in the Pahalgam attack – 26 people were killed – and calls for a “neutral” probe have done little to placate India.While Malik’s elevation amplifies ISI’s influence in shaping Pakistan’s response, both militarily and politically, critics argue this move exposes the fragility of Pakistan’s civilian governance.“Appointing the ISI chief as NSA hands the military a blank check to dictate terms, not just on security but in backchannel talks with India,” said a former diplomat.Malik’s track record as adjutant general, where he oversaw the crackdown on ex-PM Imran Khan’s supporters during the 2023 riots, suggests a hardline approach. His closeness to Army chief Gen Asim Munir, who handpicked him for the ISI role, has fuelled concerns of a military-driven agenda.Posts on X reflect public unease, with some calling it a step toward a “soft coup”, while others see it as a pragmatic response to India’s stand.The consolidation of power in Malik’s hands risks alienating civilian stakeholders and complicating diplomacy, especially after PM Narendra Modi vowed “complete operational freedom” for India’s armed forces.With the NSA post vacant since April 2022, Malik’s appointment fills a strategic void but raises questions about whether Pakistan’s military is preparing for war, negotiation, or both.","Lt Gen Muhammad Asim Malik appointed as the country’s national security adviser.

KECH: Two young Baloch students have allegedly been forcibly taken by Pakistsecurity forces in Turbat, the primary city of the Kech district in Balochistan, as reported by The Balochistan Post (TBP).Seventeen-year-old Shey Haq Baloch, the son of the deceased Altaf Baloch, and sixteen-year-old Adam Baloch, son of Saleem, were purportedly apprehended by security personnel on Tuesday shortly after arriving in Turbat from Karachi, according to TBP.Nugra Baloch, Shey Haq's sister, verified the occurrence in a Facebook post. She stated that both boys were first-year college students and were detained by Pakistani forces and intelligence agencies, as highlighted by the TBP report.""I call upon everyone to speak out against this unlawful and cruel act,"" she wrote. ""Assist us in our struggle for the safe return of my brother and Adam Baloch."" Shey Haq Baloch's father, Altaf Baloch, was killed in 2008 when Pakistani forces reportedly opened fire on a peaceful rally held by the Baloch National Front (BNF) in Turbat, according to the TBP report.In another instance on April 30, two young men, Amir, son of Dad Bakhsh, and Usman, son of Abdul Ghani, were reportedly kidnapped from a barber shop in Pasni, in Gwadar district. Both are locals of the town. A further case has been reported from Turbat's D-Baloch area, where Abdul Majeed, son of Abdul Ghani, was allegedly taken by unidentified armed individuals while he was waiting for transport with his children, as highlighted by the TBP report.Enforced disappearances in Balochistan continue to pose a serious and persistent issue. Human rights organisations have long accused Pakistani security agencies of systematically targeting students, activists, and ordinary civilians, according to the TBP report.Earlier on Tuesday, United Nations human rights experts described the ""relentless use of enforced disappearances"" in Balochistan as ""a severe human rights violation and an international crime"" and urged Pakistan to establish ""independent and effective mechanisms for searching and investigating,"" as per the TBP report.","Two young Baloch students have allegedly been forcibly taken by Pakistani security forces.

Thai prosecutors dropped royal defamation charges on Thursday against an American scholar accused of insulting the monarchy over an article published on a political website.Paul Chambers a longtime Southeast Asia politics scholar in Thailand, was arrested last month in Phitsanulok province, north of Bangkok, under the kingdom's strict lese-majeste laws .The case marked a rare instance of a foreign national being charged under Thailand's lese-majeste law, which bans criticism of King Maha Vajiralongkorn and his close family and carries sentences of up to 15 years in jail per offence.The Office of the Attorney-General said on Thursday it had decided ""not to indict"" Chambers.""The director-general had decided not to indict the suspect,"" the statement said, adding that prosecutors would seek to dismiss the case in court and coordinate with police.The Thai army, a staunch defender of the monarchy, filed the complaint over a short blurb posted on a political think tank website this year.A military spokesperson last week defended the decision to file the case following criticism that the army had no legal standing to do so under the Thai law.Trade talks between Thailand and the United States have been indefinitely postponed, fuelling speculation that the arrest may have strained diplomatic ties between the two countries.International watchdogs have expressed concern over the use of the lese-majeste laws, known as Article 112 against academics, activists and even students.One man in northern Thailand was jailed for at least 50 years for lese-majeste last year, while a woman was given a 43-year prison sentence in 2021.In 2023, a man was jailed for two years for selling satirical calendars featuring rubber ducks that a court said defamed the king.","Paul Chambers a longtime Southeast Asia politics scholar in Thailand.

Who is Chinmoy Krishna Das?

A Bangladesh court on Wednesday granted bail to former Iskcon leader Chinmoy Krishna Das in a sedition case , reported Bangladesh's The Daily Star.Das was arrested following a controversy that erupted when a sedition case was filed against him and 18 others in Chittagong on October 30 last year.The charges were linked to the hoisting of a saffron flag above Bangladesh's official flag during the October 25 rally at Laldighi Maidan in Chattogram.Das was presented before a Chittagong court on Tuesday, where his bail plea was denied, and he was sent into custody. The arrest has triggered widespread outrage, with many demanding his immediate release.Das serves as the spokesperson for the Bangladesh Sammilita Sanatani Jagran Jote , a group that champions the rights and security of minorities. He has been a vocal advocate for the Hindu (Sanatani) community in Bangladesh, calling for key reforms such as a minority protection law, a tribunal for fast-tracking cases of minority persecution, and the establishment of a dedicated ministry of minority affairs.He gained widespread attention for organising large public rallies, including one in Chittagong on October 25 and another in Rangpur on November 22, which sparked significant socio-political discussions across the country.Das hails from Satkania Upazila in Chittagong. From 2016 to 2022, he was the Chittagong divisional secretary of Iskcon. He gained popularity at an early age for his religious speeches and earned the nickname of ‘Shishu Bokta’, or ‘child orator’, reports Bangladeshi media.",Chinmoy Krishna Das is a former Iskcon leader.

COLOMBO: Sri Lanka's catholic church says the Vatican has named 167 of its faithful killed in Islamic State-inspired suicide bombings six years ago as witnesses of faith.Hundreds, including Christian, Buddhist, Hindu and Islamic religious figures, attended a vigil Monday in memory of the victims at the church of St. Anthony, targeted in the attacks.Archbishop of Colombo, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, told the attendees Cardinal Marcello Semeraro, prefect of the Dicastery for the Causes of Saints in the Vatican, has included the names of 167 catholics who died in the bombings in the churches of St. Anthony in Colombo and St. Sebastian in Negombo ""in the catalogue of the witnesses of the faith in its order book, considering the context of their heroism.""He said they were chosen ""due to violent opposition to their faith motivated by 'odium fidei,' the hate of the faith."" Ranjith also said seven victims of other faiths were ""respectfully remembered.""Witnesses of faith are those who sacrificed their lives for their belief. Pope Francis formalized in 2023 a new category of recognition by the church of people who lost their lives while professing the catholic faith and created a special Vatican commission to catalogue their cases. The commission, based in the Vatican's saint-making office, has gathered hundreds of cases, with a view to highlighting them alongside officially recognized martyrs of the church, who are on the path to possible beatification or sainthood.More than 260 people, including 42 foreigners, were killed in the near-simultaneous bombings during Easter Sunday at three tourist hotels and three churches, two Catholic and one Protestant, on April 21, 2019.The catholic church in Sri Lanka has demanded further probing in the attacks, particularly after British television Channel 4 interviewed a man who said that he arranged a meeting between a local IS-inspired group, National Thowheed Jamath, and a top state intelligence official to hatch a plot to create insecurity in Sri Lanka and enable former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to win the presidential election later that year.","Sri Lanka's catholic church says the Vatican has named 167 of its faithful killed in Islamic State-inspired suicide bombings six years ago as witnesses of faith.

LONDON: British police said Thursday that counterterrorism detectives will investigate comments by Irish hip-hop group Kneecap, which has been criticized by UK politicians over statements about the Middle East and British politics.The Irish-language rappers from Northern Ireland were reported to police over footage from a 2024 concert in which a band member appeared to say: ""The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP."" Footage from another concert, in 2023, appears to show a member of the trio shouting ""up Hamas, up Hezbollah"" - both banned organizations in the UK.London's Metropolitan Police force said the videos were referred to the Counter Terrorism internet Referral Unit for assessment by specialist officers, who have determined there are grounds for further investigation into potential offenses linked to both videos.""The investigation is now being carried out by officers from the Met's Counter Terrorism Command and inquiries remain ongoing at this time,"" the force said in a statement.The Belfast trio is known for satirical lyrics and use of symbolism associated with the Irish republican movement, which seeks to unite Northern Ireland, currently part of the UK, with the Republic of Ireland. More than 3,600 people were killed during three decades of violence in Northern Ireland involving Irish republican militants, pro-British Loyalist militias and the UK security forces.Kneecap's comments were criticized in the House of Commons this week by government and opposition lawmakers, who noted that two members of Parliament have been murdered since 2016.In a statement on Instagram , band members Liam Og O Hannaidh, Naoise O Caireallain and JJ O Dochartaigh apologized to the families of Labour Party lawmaker Jo Cox, who was killed in by a far-right attacker in 2016, and Conservative legislator David Amess, murdered in 2021 by an Islamic State supporter.The group said ""we never intended to cause you hurt."" Kneecap said it had ""never supported Hamas or Hezbollah,"" and accused ""establishment figures"" of taking comments out of context to ""manufacture moral hysteria"" because of the band's criticism of Israel's attacks on Palestinians in Gaza.Several Kneecap gigs have been cancelled as a result of the controversy, and some British lawmakers have called on organizers of June's Glastonbury Festival to scrap a planned performance by the group.Fellow musicians have come to the rappers' defense. Several dozen performers, including British rock group Primal Scream, Irish band Fontaines DC and mod singer Paul Weller have signed an open letter criticizing a ""clear, concerted attempt to censor and ultimately deplatform"" Kneecap and opposing ""political repression of artistic freedom.""","Irish hip-hop group Kneecap will be investigated by UK police over their controversial remarks.

UK govt says ‘India has full support to go after perpetrators’ of Pahalgam terror attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-govt-says-india-has-full-support-to-go-after-perpetrators-of-pahalgam-terror-attack/articleshow/120742075.cms,"TOI correspondent from London

: The UK govt has said “India has our full support to go after the perpetrators of that attack (Pahalgam terror attack)” and that it is “seeking to play its full diplomatic role to help manage heightened tensions between India and Pakistan” as the tensions spill over onto the streets of Britain.But, foreign office minister Hamish Falconer said in the House of Commons on Tuesday, “It is important there is a proper law-enforcement-led response based on a focus of the actual perpetrators.”Britain said it was “vital that here in the UK all of us in positions of influence at a community level do what we can to ensure those tensions do not play out on British streets. A terrible terrorist attack has been perpetrated … We encourage Pakistanis to cooperate fully with the Indian govt in their efforts to investigate,” Falconer said. He was speaking during a debate on the Pahalgam attack, which left 26 people dead, following an urgent question by Labour MP Gurinder Singh Josan.“The two states are talking to each other, which is welcome. It is understandable the concerns India has for its security in light of such a horrific incident and it is clearly taking steps to try to establish the facts of the incident as best it can and will have British support to do so,” Falconer said.Falconer refrained from commenting on what UK security agencies know as to who is behind the attacks. He said both the Pakistan and India high commissions “will receive all support from the UK state to ensure they remain safe.”A J&K-born man, Ankit Love (41), was charged with criminal damage after allegedly smashing windows at the Pakistan high commission on Sunday. He appeared in court on Monday. He was blacklisted by the Indian govt after being charged with criminal damage for throwing eggs and stones at the India high commission in Feb 2022.Falconer toldMPs he was aware of the throat-slitting gesture video of a Pakistan diplomat. “The Metropolitan police are investigating, so I will not provide any further commentary on that particular incident, but it is obviously concerning,” Falconer said.Several MPs expressed their horror at how Hindus and Christians were targeted in the attack. Others criticised India for suspending the Indus water treaty or making “unfounded claims” against Pakistan or resorting to ""bulldozer tactics"".Labour MP Barry Gardiner asked: “Is it not time to make the support we give to Pakistan conditional on them finally closing down the terrorist training camps that they harbour?”“Until the investigation is concluded, we should not speculate on the nature of the attack. As we understand it, international agreements have been put in abeyance, rather than being rescinded,” Falconer said.","India has our full support to go after the perpetrators of that attack (Pahalgam terror attack), UK govt says.
