RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat’s mandir-masjid take draws major dissent from seers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rss-chief-mohan-bhagwats-mandir-masjid-take-draws-major-dissent-from-seers/articleshow/116610356.cms,"LUCKNOW: Seers' organisation Akhil Bharatiya Sant Samiti (AKSS) criticised on Monday RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat 's recent remarks cautioning against 'an unacceptable trend of wannabe Hindu leaders raking up temple-mosque disputes at various sites'.AKSS general secretary Swami Jitendranand Saraswati said such religious matters should be decided by 'dharmacharyas' (religious leaders) rather than RSS, which he described as a 'cultural organisation'.""When the subject of religion arises, it is for religious gurus to decide. And whatever they decide will be accepted by Sangh and VHP,"" Saraswati said. He said despite Bhagwat's similar comments in the past, temple structures have been identified at 56 new sites, underscoring ongoing interest in these disputes. He said religious organisations often act in response to public sentiment than political agendas.Also read: Wrong understanding of dharma leads to atrocities in its name across the world, says Bhagwat This marks the first time Bhagwat has faced major dissent from within the saffron ecosystem. Religious gurus like Jagadguru Rambhadracharya believe that Sangh should defer to spiritual figures in decisions related to religion. Analysts suggested the seer's backlash reflects a larger struggle within the Hindu religious community over RSS's influence in matters of faith. Bhagwat's remarks came after Hindu groups filed legal petitions seeking the demolition of mosques they claim were built on temple sites, including Shahi Jama Masjid in UP's Sambhal. In response, Bhagwat warned that 'no one will become a leader of Hindus by raking up temple-mosque disputes and spreading communal divide'.Rambhadracharya challenged the RSS chief's authority, saying: ""Let me make it clear, Mohan Bhagwat is not our disciplinarian, but we are."" He said the recent unrest in Sambhal, where a temple-mosque dispute led to violence and five deaths, highlight the importance of judicial and democratic processes in resolving such issues.""The positive side is that things are being uncovered in favour of Hindus. We will secure this through the courts, through the ballot, and with public support,"" Rambhadracharya said.",AKSS general secretary Swami Jitendranand Saraswati said such religious matters should be decided by 'dharmacharyas' (religious leaders) rather than RSS.

The three men were killed in a joint operation by Punjab and Uttar Pradesh police on Monday morning.The official file photos of the accused show them with similar white backgrounds in the exact outfits they wore during the encounter, adding to their families' doubts about the encounter and their involvement with KZF.

He was just an ordinary young man,"" the neighbour added.Some distance away in Nikki Sahoor, Gurpreet Kaur, wife of Jasanpreet, 18, said he left home last Tuesday for a driving job.

This town is 360km from Bhopal and barely 20km from the Rajasthan border. It seems to have travelled 50-60km out of Kuno's protected perimeter and is around 70km from Ranthambore.The forest department is closely monitoring its movements. The cheetah is currently establishing its own territory outside Kuno National Park, said officials. They have opted not to tranquilize the animal, hoping it will return safely to Kuno.Residents of Sheopur were thrilled to catch a glimpse of the cheetah as it moved through the area. Locals excitedly shared videos on social media, celebrating this rare sighting outside the protected habitat.It seems to be following in the footsteps of cheetah Pawan aka Oban, the original ghumakkad, who kept wandering beyond Kuno's confines, keeping foresters on the tenterhooks. It was tranquillised in April 2023 to stop it from crossing over to Uttar Pradesh. This April, female cheetah Veera was rescued by foresters after going for a stroll in Jaura, Pahargarh, and Kailaras areas of Morena for 25 days.Rajasthan's forest officials have been alerted to the wandering cheetah's movements.

Another potential route involved taking the Raimangal River to Hemnagar in Hingalganj, or reaching Khulna via Sandeshkhali in North 24 Parganas district,” a senior STF officer said, as quoted by PTI.Munshi was arrested by the West Bengal Special Task Force (STF) in a joint operation with the Jammu and Kashmir Police. The arrest took place near Canning in South 24 Parganas district, approximately 60 km from Kolkata, late Saturday night.The suspect was acting under the instructions of the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terror group, according to the STF. The 58-year-old, described as an IED expert with extensive training in Pakistan, had been residing in the area disguised as a shawl seller for two days before he was arrested.“This individual appears to have been deeply involved in jihadist activities and was likely attempting to recruit people in the area,” the officer added. The STF is currently analyzing the call records from the mobile phones to identify potential collaborators and uncover more details about Munshi’s plans and movements.According to officials, Munshi’s notes, which are now being decoded, could provide valuable insights into his network and future plans.“Bangladesh was a strategic choice for Munshi as it could serve as a transit point to Pakistan. His journey from Kashmir to Bengal was part of a carefully calculated escape strategy,” the officer elaborated.Investigators disclosed that Munshi was the second-in-command of the TuM and had ties to other terror outfits operating in the Kashmir Valley, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. Seized during the arrest were an Aadhaar card listing a Srinagar address, Rs 50,000 in cash, and two mobile phones. Officials believe Munshi had visited Bangladesh several times in the past and maintained close contact with senior LeT members.",Javed Munshi was wanted for his alleged involvement in a 2011 cleric's murder in Jammu and Kashmir.

How Pakistan ‘copied’ design of India’s 1960 Cirus reactor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-pakistan-copied-design-of-indias-1960-cirus-reactor/articleshow/116608546.cms,"Image credit: Bhabha Atomic Research Centre

Copying Cirus

MUMBAI: A little-known incident in the history of Pakistan’s nuclear weapons programme is a purported attempt made by the country in the early ’70s to copy the design of India’s Cirus reactor — a 40 MW thermal neutron research facility, which first achieved criticality at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in Trombay, near Mumbai, on July 10, 1960. An acronym for Canada India Reactor Utility Services, Cirus was constructed with Canadian assistance at a shared cost of $14.14 million, according to news reports.Pakistan’s attempt to copy the design of the reactor was revealed by none other than Feroz H. Khan , a man who played a role in the neighbouring country’s nuclear weapons programme. In his book “Eating Grass: The Making Of The Pakistani Bomb”, published in 2012 by the Stanford University Press, Feroz wrote, “Munir Ahmed Khan, later chairman of the PAEC [Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission], recalled that in October 1965 he had met Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto [the then Pakistan foreign minister] in Vienna. Munir explained to him that he had been to India’s Cirus facility at Trombay in 1964 and saw for himself that India was well on its way to making the [nuclear] bomb. Bhutto asked Munir to meet Ayub Khan in December during Ayub’s upcoming visits to the United Kingdom and the United States and try to convince the president of the urgency of a weapons programme.” The country eventually carried out its first nuclear weapons tests on May 28 and 30, 1998.Feroz’s disclosure, though now 12 years old, assumes immediate significance in the context of the US last week announcing fresh sanctions on Pakistan’smissile development programme. For the first time, the measures target Pakistan’s state-run National Development Complex, for its role in the country’s mission development programme. US deputy NSA Jon Finer has said, “Pakistan has developed increasingly sophisticated missile technology… If these trends continue, Pakistan will have the capability to strike targets well beyond South Asia, including in the United States.”Feroz’s writing about the Cirus reactor is important because the plutonium for India’s Smiling Buddha project — the country’s first nuclear weapons test at Pokhran on May 18, 1974 — was from this reactor.According to Feroz, “Pakistani leadership wanted the rights to copy technological designs for its indigenous programme without incurring penalties and while remaining on the ‘good side’ of the international system.” He recalled: “While work to commission KANUPP [Karachi Nuclear Power Complex] went on, Munir Ahmed Khan said that there would be a secret team headed by a nuclear official, Sardar Ali Khan, to work on replicating India’s Cirus reactor.The author quotes Pervez Butt, who was purportedly part of the secret “copying’’ team and was chairman of PAEC between 2001 and 2005, as telling him, “Our team worked tirelessly, I did the mechanical part. When we merged our work and presented, Munir Khan could not believe it.”Feroz, however, has questioned Pakistan’s decision to copy the design of the Cirus reactor because there were some fundamental differences between Cirus and Kanupp.The team had modified the basic Cirus design.","Pakistan's attempt to copy the design of the reactor was revealed by none other than Feroz H.

PILIBHIT: Three alleged operatives of the Pakistan-sponsored Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF), wanted for their involvement in a series of grenade attacks in Punjab in the past month, were killed in an encounter with a joint team of Punjab and UP police on the towpath of the Hardoi feeder canal off Sharda river on NH-730 around 5.30am Monday.Two constables injured in the encounter are stable and recovering at a hospital.Gurvinder Singh, Varinder Singh alias Ravi and Jasanpreet Singh were believed to be involved in eight grende attacks on police outposts, including the one on Bakshiwal police post in Kalanaur and in Wadala Banger police station last week.Punjab DGP Gaurav Yadav told TOI: ""The ISI-directed operatives were attempting to destabilise the region. Varinder was specifically chosen to lead the grenade attack module due to his close ties with a top operative, Jaswinder Singh Manu, in Greece, and his ability to coordinate operations with handlers abroad. KZF's network relies heavily on international operatives for strategic planning. Further investigations are underway to trace their connections and dismantle the network.""Acting on intelligence provided by Punjab police, a UP police team in Pilibhit launched an operation to intercept Gurvinder, Varinder, and Jasanpreet, all of them from Punjab’s Gurdaspur district. Two modified AK-47 rifles, two Glock pistols, and a large cache of bullets were recovered from the site, police said.SP (Pilibhit) Avinash Pandey said, “A team of Punjab police approached the SHO of Puranpur and informed him that a few terrorists from Punjab who attacked a police outpost were hiding in the area. We started an intensive search operation and barricaded all the routes in the district. A picket team shared information about three suspects on a bike. A joint team of Punjab police and Pilibhit police chased them, but the suspects on the bike opened fire at us. In retaliation, police officials also opened fire at them.”Pandey added: “The suspects sustained bullet injuries and were admitted to a hospital by us. At the hospital, all three were declared ‘brought dead’ by doctors.” Two police constables were injured in the exchange of fire. Both were immediately taken to the Puranpur Community Health Centre before being transferred to Pilibhit district hospital. Their condition is stable.Police said, “A large cache of ammunition suggested the suspects were planning a bigger operation. These weapons were consistent with the group’s attempts to carry out high-profile attacks.” Ramit Sharma, ADG, Bareilly zone, said the suspects were part of a module led by Pakistan-based Ranjit Singh Neeta, the chief of KZF. “The trio operated under direct instructions from Manu in Greece and Jagjit Singh alias Fateh Singh Baghi in the UK. Varinder Singh maintained regular communication with Baghi, who remotely coordinated their actions. The suspects stole a bike from Puranpur city on Sunday night.“ Preliminary findings suggest suspects had local contacts aiding their movements,” Sharma added.","Gurvinder Singh, Varinder Singh alias Ravi and Jasanpreet Singh were believed to be involved in eight grende attacks on police outposts.

Goldberg Allegedly Chokeslams WCW Star Over Dap



Goldberg, a member of the WWE Hall of Fame, has always been a talking point, especially because of his heyday as a major star in WCW. Many fans, however, have felt that he wasn't always the most cooperative person, and it now seems that Goldberg choked a wrestler in WCW for not dapping him. During their time in WCW, Violent J shared a humorous story about Goldberg on the 1 of a Kind podcast. They once sat in the arena before the show started, with nobody else there and only a handful of wrestlers present.Goldberg, who was standing ringside on the opposite side of the guardrail, said that many men do it while sporting sweatpants and cupping their nether regions. He said, “I got a funny story about Goldberg, man. Yeah, in WCW. One time, we were sitting in the arena before the show opened, you know, and there were just a couple of wrestlers standing around. Nobody in the arena—just the workers and everything.”Further quoting, “Goldberg is standing ringside, on this side of the guard rail, and he’s got his sweatpants on, right? And he’s got his hands cupping his balls, you know what I’m saying? They’re in his pants, cupping his balls—something many men do, you know?”As Violent J and Joey watched, Evan Karagias approached Goldberg. Evan went to talk and held out his hand for a dap, according to Violent J. Goldberg took his hand off his trousers and went to give the dap back. But Evan quickly indicated where Goldberg's hand had been, conveyed his uneasiness, and made it plain that he didn't want to touch it.“So Evan Karagias comes walking up to Goldberg. Me and Joey are sitting there, watching all this, and Evan Karagias walks up to Goldberg. He goes to say something and puts his hand out to give him a dap, you know? So Goldberg removes his hand from his balls and goes to give him the dap. Evan goes, ‘Whoa, man, no! That was on your balls!’ You know what I’m saying?”ALSO READ: 5 Glorious Moments From WWE Women’s Champion Liv Morgan's Career to Remember This Holiday Goldberg, known for his intense and often intimidating persona, allegedly reacted to Evan Karagias' refusal with an unexpected display of anger. According to Violent J, Goldberg became visibly upset and proceeded to pick up Karagias and deliver a powerful chokeslam onto the ring mat. This anecdote, while humorous in its delivery, highlights a potential darker side to Goldberg's personality, showcasing a level of aggression that might not have been expected from the imposing figure.","WWE Hall of Famer Goldberg allegedly choked a WCW star over a dap.

Luigi Mangione Lawyer: Did Luigi Mangione and lawyer wear matching outfits? Why was Brian Thompson's accused killer smiling in court?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-luigi-mangione-and-lawyer-wear-matching-outfit-why-was-brian-thompsons-accused-killer-smiling-in-court/articleshow/116609442.cms,"Luigi Mangione and his lawyer were seen wearing almost similar-colored outfit.

Why Luigi Mangione was seen smiling



A fresh set of photos of 26-year-old Luigi Mangione was released as he appeared in a court in Manhattan where he pleaded not guilty to the 11-count indictment by the New York state government. He walked the court with his feet chained wearing a burgundy sweater over a white collared shirt, khakis and orange prison shoes.Social media was quick to observe that his lawyer Karen Friedman Agnifilo was wearing a matching outfit like Mangione. It's not known whether it was just a coincidence or whether Agnifilo chose to wear a matching outfit in solidarity with his client as she issued some strong statements against the ongoing treatment of the case.Agnifilo said she had never seen a perp walk as large as Mangione's in her entire career. She reiterated that her client Luigi Mangione is innocent until proven guilty but she's not sure whether Mangione would get a fair trial as government officials like New York mayor Eric Adams. Agnifilo pointed out that in his statement the mayor did not use the word 'alleged' once but called her client a murder. Luigi Mangione is a young man who has a right to defend, and he is not a human ping-pong ball or a political fodder, the lawyer said as Mangione was seated beside her focusing on what the lawyer was saying.In his appearance, Luigi Mangione was smug as his fans continued cheering for him outside the court. Inside the courtroom, there were at least two dozen women. No member of his family was present at the hearing.“How do you plead to this indictment, sir? Guilty or not guilty,” asked a court clerk.“Not guilty,” Mangione replied.He was also seen grinning during a conversation with his lawyer indicating that there was not an iota of nervousness in him while he could face the death penalty. Agnifilo's husband Marc Agnifilo who is representing music mogul Diddy was also present inside the court.Mangione will remain in the federal Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn even as the Southern District prosecutors said they’ll let local DAs get first crack at Mangione in the courtroom.","Luigi Mangione, 26, appeared in a court in Manhattan where he pleaded not guilty to the 11-count indictment by the New York state government.

and why Trump can't take it back on his own,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/a-history-of-the-panama-canal-and-why-trump-cant-take-it-back-on-his-own/articleshow/116614713.cms,"(AP photo)

Here's a look at how we got here:

What is the canal?

Who built it?

Why doesn't the US control the canal anymore?

What's happened since then?

Why has Trump raised this?

PANAMA CITY: Teddy Roosevelt once declared the Panama Canal ""one of the feats to which the people of this republic will look back with the highest pride."" More than a century later, Donald Trump is threatening to take back the waterway for the same republic.The president-elect is decrying increased fees Panama has imposed to use the waterway linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. He says if things don't change after he takes office next month, ""We will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to the United States of America, in full, quickly and without question.""Trump has long threatened allies with punitive action in hopes of winning concessions. But experts in both countries are clear: Unless he goes to war with Panama, Trump can't reassert control over a canal the US agreed to cede in the 1970s.It is a man-made waterway that uses a series of locks and reservoirs over 51 miles (82 kilometers) to cut through the middle of Panama and connect the Atlantic and Pacific. It spares ships having to go an additional roughly 7,000 miles (more than 11,000 kilometers) to sail around Cape Horn at South America's southern tip.The US International Trade Administration says the canal saves American business interests ""considerable time and fuel costs"" and enables faster delivery of goods, which is ""particularly significant for time sensitive cargoes, perishable goods, and industries with just-in-time supply chains.""An effort to establish a canal through Panama led by Ferdinand de Lesseps, who built Egypt's Suez Canal, began in 1880 but progressed little over nine years before going bankrupt.Malaria, yellow fever and other tropical diseases devastated a workforce already struggling with especially dangerous terrain and harsh working conditions in the jungle, eventually costing more than 20,000 lives, by some estimates.Panama was then a province of Colombia, which refused to ratify a subsequent 1901 treaty licensing US interests to build the canal. Roosevelt responded by dispatching US warships to Panama's Atlantic and Pacific coasts. The US also prewrote a constitution that would be ready after Panamanian independence, giving American forces ""the right to intervene in any part of Panama, to re-establish public peace and constitutional order.""In part because Colombian troops were unable to traverse harsh jungles, Panama declared an effectively bloodless independence within hours in November 1903. It soon signed a treaty allowing a US-led team to begin construction.Some 5,600 workers died later during the US-led construction project, according to one study.The waterway opened in 1914, but almost immediately some Panamanians began questioning the validity of US control, leading to what became known in the country as the ""generational struggle"" to take it over.The US abrogated its right to intervene in Panama in the 1930s. By the 1970s, with its administrative costs sharply increasing, Washington spent years negotiating with Panama to cede control of the waterway.The Carter administration worked with the government of Omar Torrijos . The two sides eventually decided that their best chance for ratification was to submit two treaties to the US Senate, the ""Permanent Neutrality Treaty"" and the ""Panama Canal Treaty.""The first, which continues in perpetuity, gives the US the right to act to ensure the canal remains open and secure. The second stated that the US would turn over the canal to Panama on December 31, 1999, and was terminated then.Both were signed in 1977 and ratified the following year. The agreements held even after 1989, when President George H.W. Bush invaded Panama to remove Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega .In the late 1970s, as the handover treaties were being discussed and ratified, polls found that about half of Americans opposed the decision to cede canal control to Panama. However, by the time ownership actually changed in 1999, public opinion had shifted, with about half of Americans in favor.Administration of the canal has been more efficient under Panama than during the US era, with traffic increasing 17% between fiscal years 1999 and 2004. Panama's voters approved a 2006 referendum authorizing a major expansion of the canal to accommodate larger modern cargo ships. The expansion took until 2016 and cost more than $5.2 billion.Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino said in a video Sunday that ""every square meter of the canal belongs to Panama and will continue to."" He added that, while his country's people are divided on some key issues, ""when it comes to our canal, and our sovereignty, we will all unite under our Panamanian flag.""Shipping prices have increased because of droughts last year affecting the canal locks, forcing Panama to drastically cut shipping traffic through the canal and raise rates to use it. Though the rains have mostly returned, Panama says future fee increases might be necessary as it undertakes improvements to accommodate modern shipping needs.Mulino said fees to use the canal are ""not set on a whim.""Jorge Luis Quijano , who served as the waterway's administrator from 2014 to 2019, said all canal users are subject to the same fees, though they vary by ship size and other factors.""I can accept that the canal's customers may complain about any price increase,"" Quijano said. ""But that does not give them reason to consider taking it back.""The president-elect says the US is getting ""ripped off"" and ""I'm not going to stand for it.""""It was given to Panama and to the people of Panama, but it has provisions - you've got to treat us fairly. And they haven't treated us fairly,"" Trump said of the 1977 treaty that he said ""foolishly"" gave the canal away.The neutrality treaty does give the US the right to act if the canal's operation is threatened due to military conflict - but not to reassert control.""There's no clause of any kind in the neutrality agreement that allows for the taking back of the canal,"" Quijano said. ""Legally, there's no way, under normal circumstances, to recover territory that was used previously.""Trump, meanwhile, hasn't said how he might make good on his threat.""There's very little wiggle room, absent a second US invasion of Panama, to retake control of the Panama Canal in practical terms,"" said Benjamin Gedan, director of the Latin America Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington.Gedan said Trump's stance is especially baffling given that Mulino is a pro-business conservative who has ""made lots of other overtures to show that he would prefer a special relationship with the United States."" He also noted that Panama in recent years has moved closer to China, meaning the US has strategic reasons to keep its relationship with the Central American nation friendly.Panama is also a US partner on stopping illegal immigration from South America - perhaps Trump's biggest policy priority.""If you're going to pick a fight with Panama on an issue,"" Gedan said, ""you could not find a worse one than the canal.""","Donald Trump is threatening to take back the Panama Canal. The US agreed to cede control of the waterway to Panama in the 1970s. The waterway links the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. It spares ships having to go an additional roughly 7,000 miles to sail around Cape Horn.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116614779,imgsize-1902162,width-400,resizemode-4/116614779.jpg"

NYC subway horror

New York Times

Officials warn of 'serious consequences'

Police chief defends officer seen in video

Previous attacks on trains

Sebastian Zapeta-Calil , a 33-year-old man who allegedly burned a woman on a subway train in New York City, was charged with first-degree murder and arson on Monday. Videos circulating on social media show the woman on fire in a subway doorway, with a man appearing to fan the flames.The incident occurred early Sunday on a parked F train at the Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue station in New York City. Police said Zapeta-Calil approached the woman and set her clothing on fire with a lighter. The victim, who has not been identified, was apparently homeless. Sitting at the end of the subway car, the victim was consumed by flames within seconds. Disturbing video footage shows the suspect watching the incident with a chillingly indifferent demeanor as the victim burned.Police said that the victim did not know Zapeta-Calil. They reportedly rode the same train from Queens to Coney Island, where the attack occurred.NYPD commissioner Jessica Tisch called the attack “one of the most depraved crimes one person could possibly commit.”Following the attack, teenagers reported spotting a man who resembled the suspect on another train, which led to Zapeta-Calil's arrest.

Trump Wants To Buy Greenland: 'Absolute necessity': Why Trump wants to buy Greenland,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/absolute-necessity-why-trump-wants-to-buy-greenland/articleshow/116605013.cms,"Donald Trump hinted he still wants to buy Greenland, a self-ruling territory of Denmark, saying that US ownership and control of the island is an “absolute necessity” for national security.The US President-elect reopened a debate from 2019, when he offered to buy what is the world’s biggest island, a proposal that was quickly rebuffed by Denmark at the time.“For purposes of National Security and Freedom throughout the World,” Trump said on Truth Social Sunday, “the United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity.”Greenland is already crucial to American national defence, being home to a US air base and a radar station. The war in Ukraine has dramatically increased the territory’s military value to the US and NATO, given the island’s strategic location between the Arctic and the North Atlantic.Trump made the statement on Sunday as he nominated PayPal co-founder Ken Howery for US ambassador to the Kingdom of Denmark. Howery responded on X saying he would work to “deepen the bonds” between the US, Denmark and Greenland. Howery was an ambassador to Sweden from 2019 to 2021, under Trump’s first administration.Commenting on Trump’s post, Greenland’s Prime Minister Mute Bourup Egede said by email that the island is “not for sale and will never be for sale.” However, he said Greenland must continue to be open to cooperation and trade directly with other countries, especially its neighbors.The autonomous authority published a blueprint for its foreign, security and defence policy earlier this year, in which it outlined hopes to forge closer links with North America through trade in critical minerals and by having a bigger say in key defence relationships that have historically been governed by Denmark.Trump’s proposal to buy Greenland in 2019 triggered tensions between the US and Denmark, with Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen describing it as “absurd,” making it clear Greenland was not for sale. The Danish government didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump’s more recent statement.The renewed interest in Greenland comes as Trump on Sunday threatened to retake control over the Panama Canal and earlier in the week suggested Canada could become the US’s 51st state.","Donald Trump says US ownership and control of Greenland is an 'absolute necessity' The US President-elect reopened a debate from 2019, when he offered to buy what is the world's biggest island.

Coast guardsmen from Barnegat Light, New Jersey, are voicing frustration after federal officials dismissed their accounts of being followed by a fleet of drones while patrolling the Atlantic Ocean earlier this month.A Coast guard member, speaking anonymously, shared his disbelief, stating, “It’s the implication that’s insulting.”“It’s implying we’re making things up, when the ones making up things are down in Washington, DC.”The sailor’s comments came shortly after the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) imposed temporary flight restrictions over parts of New Jersey and New York. He was among 12 crew members aboard the 47-foot rescue vessel that encountered the drones on the evening of the sighting.“We were actually out there to see if we could spot any drones, because of all these sightings,” the sailor explained. “Well, we found some drones. Or more accurately, they found us.”According to the sailor, the drones appeared suddenly around 9 pm and followed the vessel for about 15 minutes. The drone swarm mirrored the boat’s movements, shifting direction as the boat did. “They had four propellers, about seven feet across, with festive red, green, and white flashing lights,” he said. The drones flew at an estimated 80 to 100 feet above the vessel.The swarm kept pace with the Department of Homeland Security boat, which was travelling at around 20 knots (just over 20 miles per hour). The drones eventually ascended, climbing an additional 100 feet before veering left towards the shoreline and disappearing from sight.The sailor is adamant that these were no ordinary commercial drones. “Commercial airplanes don’t move like that. We know what drones look and sound like,” he said.However, White House spokesman John Kirby downplayed the Coast Guard’s account, suggesting the drones could have been a mix of commercial, hobbyist, and law enforcement drones, as well as aircraft and even stars mistakenly identified as drones. Kirby stated that the sightings presented no national security or public safety threat, and suggested that the Coast Guard might have confused incoming airliners with drones.The Coast Guardsman disagreed, saying, “I can’t pretend to know what’s going on, but those weren’t the types of drones you can buy at the store. These were government drones.”The sailor added, “I don’t care what Kirby or [DHS head Alejandro] Mayorkas say — they’re full of sh-t.” He stressed that while their orders were to observe and not engage with the drones, they would have taken defensive action if the drones had acted aggressively.Local officials, including Representatives Chris Smith and Jeff Van Drew, have criticised the federal response, demanding a clear explanation for the mysterious drone activity, the New York Post quoted.Since November 18, more than 1,000 drone sightings have been reported over New Jersey, with dozens more in New York’s airspace, raising growing concerns over the presence of drones in civilian airspace. Federal authorities, however, maintain that the sightings pose no security threat.","Coast guardsmen from Barnegat Light, New Jersey, are voicing frustration after federal officials dismissed their accounts of being followed by a fleet of drones.

Joe Biden Death Row Pardon: Why these three men weren't granted clemency,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/joe-biden-death-row-pardon-why-these-three-men-werent-granted-clemency/articleshow/116605048.cms,"1. Robert D. Bowers: The Tree of Life Synagogue Shooting



2. Dylann Roof: The Charleston Church Massacre



3. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev: The Boston Marathon Bombing



Biden’s Decision: A Line Drawn at Hate and Terrorism



President Joe Biden's decision to commute the sentences of nearly all federal death row inmates stands as one of his most consequential acts of clemency. Yet, even as he commuted the sentences of 37 men, sparing them from federal execution, three individuals convicted of some of the most notorious and heinous crimes in recent US history were excluded from this reprieve. Their crimes, marked by hatred, terror, and mass murder, continue to resonate with national and international audiences.Robert D. Bowers, now 52, carried out the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in US history. On October 27, 2018, Bowers stormed the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, during Shabbat services. Armed with an AR-15-style rifle and multiple handguns, he murdered 11 worshippers and injured several others, including police officers responding to the attack.Bowers' actions were fueled by antisemitic hatred, as evidenced by his social media activity and statements made during the attack. He accused Jews of supporting immigration policies he opposed and declared his intention to kill as many Jews as possible. His crime sent shockwaves through the country, sparking renewed debates about hate crimes , gun control, and the rise of extremism in the US.Dylann Roof, now 30, is a white supremacist who carried out the 2015 mass shooting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Posing as a Bible study participant, Roof joined the parishioners for nearly an hour before opening fire, killing nine Black worshippers, including the church's pastor, Rev. Clementa Pinckney.Roof’s motive was rooted in racial hatred. He later admitted that he chose the church specifically because of its historical significance to the Black community. Roof hoped his actions would incite a race war, a goal he detailed in a racist manifesto he published online. His lack of remorse and overtly hateful ideology made him the first person in US history sentenced to death for a federal hate crime.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, now 31, carried out the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing alongside his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev. The attack, executed with homemade pressure cooker bombs, killed three people, including an eight-year-old boy, and injured more than 260 others, many of whom suffered life-altering injuries such as amputations.The bombing was an act of terrorism aimed at punishing the US for its military actions. In the ensuing manhunt, the Tsarnaev brothers killed an MIT police officer and engaged in a violent confrontation with law enforcement, during which Tamerlan was killed. Dzhokhar was apprehended shortly thereafter. During his trial, evidence showed his continued support for extremist ideologies, which contributed to his death sentence.President Biden's commutations were grounded in his long-standing opposition to the death penalty, reinforced by a moratorium on federal executions issued during his administration. However, Biden drew a firm line when it came to mass killings driven by hate or terror. In his statement, Biden underscored his belief that while the death penalty should generally be abolished, exceptions must be made for ""cases of terrorism and hate-motivated mass murder.""These three men represent the kinds of crimes Biden deemed beyond the scope of clemency, crimes that not only claimed innocent lives but also targeted entire communities with terror and hatred. For the families of their victims, as well as many others, their continued presence on federal death row signals the profound weight of justice in the face of unforgivable acts.Biden’s nuanced approach has been praised and criticized, reflecting the deep divisions in public opinion on the death penalty, particularly in cases as infamous and devastating as these.","President Joe Biden commuted the sentences of nearly all federal death row inmates.

US President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to restore the original name of the United States’ tallest mountain, nearly a decade after former President Barack Obama renamed it to honour Alaska’s native community.The 20,000-foot peak, located in Denali National Park and Preserve in south-central Alaska, had been known as Mount McKinley since 1917. The name honoured the 25th US president, William McKinley, who was assassinated in 1901.However, in 2015, Obama signed an order renaming the mountain Denali, which means ""The High One"" in the local Athabascan language, reflecting its traditional name among Alaska's indigenous people, as per the New York Post.Speaking at a rally in Phoenix on Sunday, Trump criticised the decision and reaffirmed his plans to reverse it. “They took his name off Mount McKinley,” Trump told his supporters. “He was a great president. That’s one of the reasons that we’re going to bring back the name of Mount McKinley, because I think he deserves it.”William McKinley, who served as president from 1897, was known for his efforts to promote US industry through protective tariffs and for leading the country to victory in the Spanish-American War. Critics of Obama’s 2015 order pointed out that McKinley had never visited the mountain and had no significant historical ties to Alaska.Denali had already been officially recognised as the peak’s name by the state of Alaska in 1975, and local leaders had long lobbied for federal recognition of the indigenous name. During Trump’s first term in office, he reportedly discussed the matter with Alaska’s Republican senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan in March 2017, according to CNN. Both senators, however, advised him to retain the name Denali.As Trump prepares for his upcoming term, the proposal to reinstate Mount McKinley’s name has reignited debate over the balance between honouring historical figures and respecting indigenous heritage.","US President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to restore the original name of the United States' tallest mountain.

At that time, he gave an address of a shelter on Radall's Island.He was calmly watching the sleeping woman whom he later set on fire allegedly, leading to her death.The madman ignited the victim's clothing with a lighter and the woman was fully engulfed by fire in a matter of seconds. Patrolling cops reached the site at once, and extinguished the blaze but the victim died at the scene.Zapeta was arrested after three high schoolers tipped off the police saying that they saw the man pictured in images released by the NYPD at the Jay and York Street station on the F line. When the police responded to that call, they found Zapeta on another train leaving the station. But he was wearing the same gray hoodie, wool hat and paint-splattered pants.","Sebastian Zapeta, 33, was arrested for torching a sleeping woman on a Brooklyn subway train. He was charged with murder and arson charges after he was picked up about eight hours after the bone-chilling murder he did. It's not known when he crossed the border again after being deported in 2018.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116610093,imgsize-1152850,width-400,resizemode-4/116610093.jpg"
Matt Gaetz Ethics Report: 'Giving funds to your date is now prostitution?': Trump's former pick Matt Gaetz reacts to sexual misconduct report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/matt-gaetz-reacts-to-ethics-report-giving-funds-to-someone-you-/articleshow/116609912.cms,"Matt Gaetz filed a lawsuit against the publishing of the report calling it defamatory.

What did the report reveal against Gaetz?

Former Congressman and Donald Trump's former pick for the attorney general post Matt Gaetz reacted to the ethics committee probe report into the allegations of sexual misconduct against him and said that giving funds to someone you are dating is not engaging in prostitution.""Giving funds to someone you are dating - that they didn’t ask for - and that isn’t “charged” for sex is now prostitution?!?""""There is a reason they did this to me in a Christmas Eve-Eve report and not in a courtroom of any kind where I could present evidence and challenge witnesses. This is testimony from one of the alleged “prostitutes” that you won’t see in the report!"" he wrote.Gaetz posted a series of screenshots of the testimony of the women who brought the allegations against him and pointed out that they never said that they charged the money for sex.Apart from defending on X, Matt Gaetz also filed a suit against the ethics committee seeking a temporary order to prevent the release of the report saying that it contains “untruthful and defamatory information” that would “significantly damage” his “standing and reputation in the community.” Gaetz’s complaint argues he’s no longer under the committee’s jurisdiction since he resigned from Congress.The US House Ethics Committee has found that former Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz paid tens of thousands of dollars to women for drugs and sex, including with a 17-year-old girl.The report found that Gaetz paid more than $90,000 to 12 different women, payments the Ethics panel determined were likely in connection with sexual activity and drug use.The Ethics panel received testimony that Gaetz had sex twice with a 17-year-old girl, described in the report as ""Victim A,"" at a party in 2017. ""Victim A recalled receiving $400 in cash from Representative Gaetz that evening, which she understood to be payment for sex,"" the report said. ""Victim A said that she did not inform Representative Gaetz that she was under 18 at the time, nor did he ask her age.""All of the women who testified said the sexual encounters with Gaetz were consensual, the report said.","The US House Ethics Committee has found that former Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz paid tens of thousands of dollars to women for drugs and sex, including with a 17-year-old girl.

Pakistan government forms committee to negotiate with jailed former premier Imran Khan's party,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-government-forms-committee-to-negotiate-with-jailed-former-premier-imran-khans-party/articleshow/116570205.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The Shehbaz Sharif-led Pakistan government on Sunday formed a negotiation committee to start formal talks with jailed former prime minister Imran Khan 's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party after it threatened to give a call for civil disobedience.According to a government statement, the committee includes deputy Prime Minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, the prime minister's political aide Rana Sanaullah, education minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, minister for privatisation Aleem Khan, minister for religious affairs Chaudhry Salik Hussain and Senator Irfan Siddiqui among others.The PTI welcomed the formation of the government committee for negotiations, calling it a ""positive step"".""We consider the committee's formation a constructive step. Meaningful dialogue based on positive intentions should be held,"" PTI chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said.He stressed that the potential talks should have a defined timeframe, adding that the dialogue must progress positively considering the sensitivity of the situation.National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq had taken the lead by offering on Wednesday that he was ready to host the two sides and facilitate their parleys.He welcomed the newly constituted committee and invited the government and opposition for talks, saying ""the speaker's office is always open for members"", according to a statement issued by the NA Secretariat.The speaker called on members of both committees to meet on Monday morning, adding that he would meet them at his chambers in Parliament House.PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqas Akram said his party accepted the speaker's invitation to meet. He said their committee will attend the meeting on Monday.Akram said the PTI founder will be informed about the progress of the meeting and he will decide whether to cancel the civil disobedience movement .The talks are being held after the PTI had threatened to give a call for civil disobedience.The party posted on X from the account of the jailed former prime minister regarding the call for civil disobedience movement, which was initially shared on December 19, stating that the campaign will be launched if the government doesn't make progress on the party's demands by Sunday.""I had presented two demands to the government, the release of under-trial political prisoners and the establishment of a judicial commission for a transparent investigation into the events of May 9, 2023 and November 26, 2024,"" the post quoted PTI founder Khan. It further stated that both of these demands ""are legitimate"".""If the government fails to take any action on them by Sunday, the first phase of the civil disobedience movement - 'remittance boycott' - will be launched,"" it said.PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqas Akram also reiterated that the civil disobedience drive would be launched tomorrow (Monday) if the party's demands go unmet.However, the issue of civil disobedience has been apparently put on hold for some time while allowing the two sides to address the differences through political means.Khan, 72, on December 5 had warned of a civil disobedience movement from December 14 if his demands about the release of political prisoners facing trial and the formation of a judicial commission to probe the events of May 9, 2023, and November 26 this year were unmet.Meanwhile, Pakistan's military courts sentenced 25 civilians to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years for attacking military installations during riots which erupted following the arrest of Khan in May last year, the Army announced on Saturday.On May 9, 2023, Khan's PTI supporters allegedly attacked several military installations, including the army headquarters in Rawalpindi and the ISI building in Faisalabad, to vent their anger against the arrest of their party founder in a corruption case.Hundreds of suspects were arrested in the countrywide swoop and at least 103 were handed over to the military authorities for trial due to their involvement in attacks on military installations.Khan's party has launched multiple protests through 2023 and 2024 demanding the release of their supreme leader, the latest being in November 2024.The former prime minister, currently lodged at the Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail, was arrested in August last year and faces multiple cases since his government was toppled in April 2022.","The committee includes deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, the prime minister's political aide Rana Sanaullah, education minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, minister for privatisation Aleem Khan.

"1,566 terror attacks killed 924 in Pakistan over past 10 months",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/1566-terror-attacks-killed-924-in-pakistan-over-past-10-months/articleshow/116551393.cms,"KARACHI: Ten years have passed since Ajoon Khan's son died in a ghastly attack by the Pakistani Taliban that killed about 150 people, mostly children, at a military-run school in Peshawar, in northwestern Pakistan. But the pain of loss is unrelenting - it grows only deeper with time. Khan, a lawyer, said he could never forget the parents sobbing and pleading outside the school gates.The brutal assault on the school in Peshawar led to rare political unity in support of a comprehensive counterterrorism strategy for Pakistan and a vast military operation in the country's former tribal areas near Afghanistan. The efforts forced militants to retreat across the border and brought a degree of relative peace to Pakistan. Large-scale terrorist attacks were significantly reduced, with fatalities dropping from 2,451 across 1,717 attacks in 2013 to 220 in 146 attacks in 2020. But the hard-won gains are now in jeopardy.Over the past few years, violence by the Pakistani Taliban and other Islamic militant groups has surged in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in northwestern Pakistan. Experts attribute the increase to the Afghan Taliban's seizure of power in neighbouring Afghanistan in Aug 2021.Last week, the interior ministry reported that 924 people, including civilians and law enforcement personnel, had been killed in 1,566 terrorist attacks across the country over the past 10 months. It said 341 terrorists had been killed during the period.Early on Saturday, sixteen soldiers were killed in northwest Pakistan in an attack by Islamist militants, a senior police official in the South Waziristan region said. Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), also known as the Pakistan Taliban, claimed responsibility for the attack, giving a higher figure for the number of personnel killed, Reuters reported.Experts and security officials have identified a range of challenges impeding Pakistan's progress against terrorism: political instability, weak governance, dwindling public support, economic constraints and reduced US counterterrorism assistance after the end of the 20-year war in Afghanistan.""The greatest challenge lies in mobilising the necessary financial resources and manpower for operations across such vast regions,"" said Muhammad Amir Rana, director of the Pak Institute for Peace Studies, a security think tank in Islamabad. The source of the problem for Pakistan, experts say, is found across the border, in Afghanistan.The Taliban administration in Kabul, the Afghan capital, denies accusations of harbouring militants from TTP. But Asfandyar Mir, a senior expert at the United States Institute of Peace, said the TTP had been given ""a permissive safe haven in Afghanistan,"" which had allowed it to become ""resilient and lethal.""Pakistani security officials privately acknowledged that they had misjudged how the new Taliban rulers of Afghanistan would handle TTP. The officials had anticipated that the Taliban leaders would help curb the TTP in return for the covert support that Pakistan had provided them during the US-led war. Instead, the Taliban in Kabul have provided the TTP with resources and advanced American-made weapons and equipment seized after the collapse of the US-supported Afghan govt, according to a senior security official in Islamabad who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The TTP has gone on to unleash a wave of attacks inside Pakistan as it wages a campaign whose aim is to overthrow the govt. Among them was a suicide bombing in January 2023 that killed over 100 people at a mosque in Peshawar.Pakistani security forces have also been locked in a conflict with ethnic separatist groups in Balochistan, an arid province bordering Afghanistan and Iran that is home to the Chinese-run port Gwadar. nyt","Violence by the Pakistani Taliban and other Islamic militant groups has surged in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in northwestern Pakistan.

In a veiled reference to India’s missile programme, the statement highlighted the discrepancy in US concerns over Pakistan’s capabilities, which are intended solely for the defence of the country’s sovereignty and regional peace.The office reaffirmed Pakistan's right to develop its strategic capabilities to maintain credible minimum deterrence and respond to evolving threats. ""Pakistan will not tolerate any intrusion into its missile programme,"" the statement said, stressing that there is strong national consensus on this issue.Despite these concerns, Pakistan reiterated its willingness to engage constructively with the US on all matters, including security and regional stability, building on the longstanding history of cooperation between the two nations.","US Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer accused Pakistan of developing long-range ballistic missile capabilities.

Pakistan’s military announced Saturday that 25 civilians have been sentenced to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years for their alleged involvement in violent protests following the arrest of former PM Imran Khan on May 9 last year, which resulted in the death of at least eight people.Khan’s supporters stormed govt buildings and military installations. The military’s statement detailed that the convictions relate primarily to attacks on key military sites, including Jinnah House (the Lahore corps commander’s residence), General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, and a Pakistan Air Force (PAF) base in Mianwali.The sentences were issued by Field General Court Martial as part of the first phase of trials. Supreme Court had earlier conditionally allowed military courts to pronounce verdicts for 85 civilians detained in connection with the riots.The military statement highlighted that the convicts have the right to appeal and other legal recourses as guaranteed by law.The May 9 violence led to the arrest of many politicians and supporters of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party. PTI has denied involvement in the violence. However, govt and military maintain that the attacks were meticulously planned and executed by PTI brass.Khan and his party have called for a judicial probe into the May 9 events, claiming the violence was a “false flag” operation intended to suppress PTI.PTI condemned the military court’s decision. National Assembly leader of opposition Omar Ayub wrote on X: “Military court sentences against civilians rejected. The detainees are civilians and cannot be tried by military courts.” He labelled the process as “kangaroo courts”.PTI’s US chapter criticised the rulings. “Colonels and majors, acting as judges, have sentenced civilians it tried in military courts. These civilians were held for over a year in harsh conditions, with many tortured into giving false confessions,” it posted on X.Amnesty International also denounced the military court’s decision, describing it as “an intimidation tactic, designed to crack down on dissent”.Army’s media wing Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) referred to the protests as “politically provoked violence and arson”. ISPR said further sentences for the remaining accused will be announced once the legal process is completed.",25 civilians have been sentenced to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years. Convictions relate primarily to attacks on key military sites.
