Kolkata doctor horror: How a shadowy ‘North Bengal lobby’ shapes hospital decisions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kolkata-doctor-horror-how-a-shadowy-north-bengal-lobby-shapes-hospital-decisions/articleshow/113243481.cms,"Posters against the North Bengal lobby appeared on the RG Kar campus as protests intensified last month (left); Sandip Ghosh (right)

What is the North Bengal lobby?

How does it function?

What is the RG Kar link?

Two doctors linked to ‘North Bengal lobby’ suspended

KOLKATA: With the agitating junior doctors and students putting up the heat on those allegedly part of the ‘ North Bengal lobby’ across medical colleges, an FIR has been lodged against three doctors – Birupaksha Biswas , Avik De and Ranjit Saha – all linked to ‘North Bengal lobby’ and close aides of former RG Kar principal Sandip Ghosh – at Bowbazar police station.Police have compiled all complaints into one FIR and have registered a case under section 351 (assault as making a gesture or preparation that causes someone to believe that they are about to be subjected to criminal force) of BNS.➤ The ‘North Bengal lobby’ refers to a group of officials and doctors working in govt-run hospitals and medical colleges. The shadowy group has dominated newspaper headlines, social media posts and canteen conversations since Aug 9, when a young RG Kar doctor was raped and murdered at her workplace. Here, we try to make sense of what it is and who constitute it for readers not familiar with the group.➤ This is not a geographical identity. The name tries to deﬁne a group of doctors who are close associates of an orthopaedic surgeon who passed out of the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital (NBMCH). A whole lot of doctors who owe allegiance to the group and its leader may not have been students of the NBMCH. And not everyone who has passed out of this reputable medical college belongs to this lobby.➤The North Bengal lobby has, according to its critics and senior state health ofﬁcials, come to control much of the day-to-day functioning of govt hospitals and medical colleges. Its inﬂuence on health administration far outweighs its number or ofﬁcial designations of its members. The lobby, for example, has come to decide many of the transfers and ""punishment"" postings of those who refuse to fall in line as well as transfers to ""coveted"" institutes or departments for those who need to be rewarded.➤ Almost all controversial decisions of the recent past have been attributed to the North Bengal lobby by seniors in the state health department. A case in point is the posting of the now-shamed former RG Kar principal, Sandip Ghosh. He was twice transferred out of RG Kar by the state health department in the last couple of years but, each time, got back this prized posting within days or weeks. Senior health department ofﬁcials have attributed this only to his being an important part of the North Bengal lobby.➤ Many of these decisions seem devoid of any logic or rationale and bypass the usual hierarchy of the health department. The names of some of the beneﬁciaries of the North Bengal lobby's largesse have appeared in mainstream media recently; they include Avik De, Birupaksha Biswas, Susanta Roy and Suhrita Paul. The names of some of these doctors have also cropped up repeatedly in connection with the attempted cover-up of the RG Kar crime.➤ RG Kar, more than any other medical college and hospital, has been under the North Bengal lobby’s control, say health department ofﬁcials. A crosssection of the hospital staff has identiﬁed former principal Ghosh as the spearhead.➤ Many of those whose names have cropped up in connection with the crime’s coverup were also seen in the vicinity of the crime scene, say hospital ofﬁcials. They include Biswas, De and Ray. None of them had any direct link with RG Kar (one, for example, worked in Burdwan, about 110 km away) but were often seen on the campus.➤ The RG Kar campus had almost become the North Bengal lobby’s unofﬁcial headquarters for some time, say state health department seniors. “We are not surprised by the scale of corruption at this hospital and the maladministratin that gave rogues like Sanjay Roy , the key accused in the rape-murder case, so much control over the campus and its day-to-day affairs,” a senior health department ofﬁcial said.➤ Earlier, the state health department suspended two doctors Avik De and Birupaksha Biswas who are in the eye of a storm in medical colleges across the state. Names of the two appear prominently in posters of the 'health syndicate' that were found recently in medical colleges.Both are also known to be close associates of RG Kar ex-principal Sandip Ghosh. De is the man in red-T shirt in the crime scene who Kolkata Police touted as a fingerprint expert which IMA Bengal challenged. He used to work as an RMO in Burdwan Medical College who is now a first-year surgery PGT at IPGMER.➤ Birupaksha Biswas, senior resident doctor of pathology, too, has been embroiled in controversy. Junior doctors said he too was present in R G Kar on Aug 9 whereas he had no locus standi to be present. Audio clips where he is heard threatening other students and junior doctors have gone viral even as Biswas had dismissed those as AI-generated.He was transferred to Kakdwip Sub-Divisional Hospital last Aug from Burdwan Medical College but his release order was issued only on Tuesday. Protest had also erupted in the Kakdwip hospital over his transfer there.","FIR lodged against three doctors linked to ‘North Bengal lobby’ and close aides of former RG Kar principal Sandip Ghosh.

Adarsh, who arrived at the spot, issued ban orders under CrPC 144, restricting the gathering of four or more people in groups.Additional police forces from Mandya, Bellur, and Bindiganavile were deployed to regain control of the situation. The police resorted to lobbing tear gas shells to control the mob.The Ganesha idols have been temporarily placed near a temple, and devotees are demanding the arrest of those who caused disturbance to the procession. The situation remains tense even after two hours, as confirmed by sources.","The incident occurred when devotees from Badarikoppalu were carrying two Ganesh idols for immersion.

"After Kolkata docs set new demands, Mamata govt says 'not ready to accept': Top developments",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-kolkata-docs-set-new-demands-mamata-govt-says-not-ready-to-accept-top-developments/articleshow/113263621.cms,"NEW DELHI: The impasse between the protesting junior doctors and West Bengal state government continued as they listed out a fresh set of demands on Wednesday for accepting the government's appeal to discuss the way forward.The response from the doctors came after West Bengal chief secretary Manoj Pant appealed to the protesting doctors to send a delegation of 12-15 representatives to state secretariat Wednesday evening for discussions.However, the junior doctors forum demanded that they want to send a delegation of at least 30 representatives to meet with CM, including one from each of the 26 medical colleges in the state, besides seeking live telecast of the meeting. According to news agency ANI, the doctors refused to attend because it was said to be a closed-door meeting.""The mail that we received yesterday was from the principal secretary and it was written that there is a meeting with senior government officials, stating it to be a closed-door meeting. We refused it because we were against the closed-door meeting,"" a protesting doctor was quoted as saying.The junior doctors' email reply read, ""We want to send a delegate team of at least 30 representatives. We want the meeting to be live telecasted for the sake of transparency among all parties. We are re-emphasising our point that we want our discussion to be in the presence of chief minister. We want the meeting to be based around our 5-point demands.""Responding to the demands, the West Bengal government said that it was not ready to accept any condition for a meeting. ""Setting conditions for talks is not a reflection of coming with an open mind to find solutions to problems which plague the doctors. The government is ready to listen to whatever they have to say. But they can't set preconditions for such a meeting,"" Statehealth minister said addressing a press conference.The minister confirmed that the state will stick to the Supreme Court's direction on rejoining duties of the agitating doctors. ""You will see what steps we take about this as and when it happens,"" Bhattacharya said.The West Bengal Junior Doctors’ Front earlier issued a five point demand, which included holding everyone responsible for the rape and murder to be punished, implement strict disciplinary action against ex Principal Sandip Ghosh , resignation of Kolkata Police Commissioner Vineet Goyal , eliminate the alleged ""threat culture"" in hospitals and colleges, ensure adequate security measures for healthcare workers.The protesting doctors have also been calling for the dismissal of key officials in the state health department, including the health secretary, the directors of health services and medical education. A similar invitation for dialogue was extended by the health secretary on Tuesday evening, but the doctors refused it, questioning the logic of engaging in talks with the very person whose suspension is one of their main demands.“One of our main demands is the suspension of health secretary Narayan Swarup Nigam . Yet, the email for a meeting on our demands came from the same Health Secretary's office, which is insulting,"" a junior doctor was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.In light of this, the appeal on Wednesday came from chief secretary Manoj Pant.""We appreciate your willingness to engage in dialogue, as constructive discussions are crucial to addressing concerns and collaboratively enhancing our healthcare system,"" the chief secretary's statement read.The Supreme Court on Monday had ordered protesting doctors in West Bengal, demonstrating over the case, to return to work by 5 pm on Tuesday or face disciplinary action from the state government.Nevertheless, despite the Supreme Court's ultimatum, the junior doctors have pledged to continue their protest for justice.( with inputs from agencies)","The West Bengal Junior Doctors’ Front earlier issued a five point demand, which included holding everyone responsible for the rape and murder to be punished.

He began shouting from the balcony warning people against entering the gate.Mohammed Ansari , 10, a resident of their building, was about to enter Vasant Vihar when the siblings screamed out to him and stopped him from touching the iron gate. Darshan promptly contacted Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB).While he was on the phone with MSEB officials, a delivery agent on a scooter arrived at Vasant Vihar, unaware of the live wire. The siblings alerted him, too. They even stepped out with umbrellas to warn people until help arrived.

In a recent post, he calls for a four-way paternity test to resolve what he describes as years of deception and corruption by the British monarchy.Dorante-Day's post highlights a photo comparison of himself, King Charles, and the King’s sons, Prince William and Prince Harry, as evidence supporting his demand for answers.“The left side of my face identically matches Charles, whilst neither William nor Harry’s does,” Dorante-Day wrote in his post, raising the question, “Just who are Charles’s real sons?” His demand for a paternity test stems from this comparison, which he claims shows an inconsistency in the physical features between him and the royal heirs.Dorante-Day and his wife, Dr Elvianna, are pushing for a paternity test involving King Charles, William, and Harry to finally reveal the truth. He claims that for 58 years, the monarchy, the government, and the establishment have hidden the truth, which he now seeks to expose. “The lies and corruption must be uncovered for what they are—criminal activity,” he wrote.""

Social media was up in arms Tuesday claiming that illegal Haitian immigrants in Ohio are eating pets of other residents including cats and ducks. Ohio senator JD Vance reacted to the reports and said he raised the issue of Haitian illegal immigrants earlier. ""Reports now show that people have had their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn't be in this country.Where is our border czar?"" Vance posted on X.Elon Musk also contributed to the debate as he wrote in a reply to an X post: ""Apparently, people's pet cats are being eaten.""Social media posts, made by right-wingers, claimed that residents of Springfield Ohio are saying that Haitians are eating the pets of other residents. One such incident did actually take place last month as reported by Fox News. An Ohio woman was arrested after she killed a cat and then began eating it in front of the neighbors. Allexis Telia Ferrell, 27, is charged with injuring animals, prohibitions concerning companion animals and disorderly conduct, the report said.The woman reportedly stomped in the cat's head to kill it before she ate it in front of a residential area in Ohio.But there was no evidence to prove whether she is a Haitian woman.The video of the incident went viral over the weekend and Kamala Harris was held responsible for immigrants eating cats in residential areas -- ahead of the big Kamala Harris - Donald Trump debate on September 10.Another photo of a 'Haitian man walking around with an entire goose' added to the online hatred.Republicans shared the video of Kamala Harris stating how her administration extended temporary protected status to over 100,000 Haitian migrants.""Less than three months ago, Kamala Harris and her Administration blocked 300k unvetted Haitian Migrants from being deported out of our country. Today, those unvetted migrants are sucking up precious resources and destroying Springfield, Ohio. Kamala Harris did this,"" Donald Trump Jr posted.The Springfield Police Division said Monday morning they have received no reports related to pets being stolen and eaten. Springfield Police said they were aware of the social media post but this was ""not something that’s on our radar right now"". The claims appeared to have originated from a commenter at a local city meeting, who said migrants were grabbing ducks from the park to kill and eat, and from local crime-watch Facebook groups. They were then shared on other social media platforms with Republicans amplifying them.""It’s all coming to your city if Kamala Harris is elected in November. It doesn’t have to be this way. Beginning on day one, President Trump will begin the largest mass deportation operation in US history – because he’ll always put America, and Americans, FIRST,"" the Trump campaign sent out an email targeting Harris campaign over the Haitian immigrants issue.","Social media posts, made by right-wingers, claimed that residents of Springfield Ohio are saying that Haitians are eating the pets of other residents.

Vice President Kamala Harris found herself under a social media microscope following her appearance in Tuesday’s ABC News Presidential Debate against former President Trump . The spotlight shifted from policy to performance as Harris' animated facial expressions were broadcasted on split screens, capturing the attention—and criticism—of viewers and commentators alike.Throughout Trump's responses, Harris was caught on camera rolling her eyes, furrowing her brow, and showcasing exaggerated smiles.With both candidates’ microphones muted during the other's speaking time—a rule Harris' campaign had unsuccessfully challenged—her only outlet for reaction was through these vivid facial gestures.Social media erupted with mixed reactions. Critics slammed her expressions as rehearsed and lacking authenticity. “Kamala Harris is doing obviously rehearsed routines instead of answering questions. Then she does rehearsed and exaggerated facial expressions when Trump talks. She comes across as fake and weak,” tweeted New York Post columnist Miranda Devine .Pollster Frank Luntz commented, “On content, Harris is winning. Visually, she's hurting herself. #Debate2024,” while conservative writer Carmine Sabia noted, “Kamala Harris has been way over coached on doing facial expressions because of the muted mics. It is uncomfortable and weird.”Others, like Fox News correspondent Aisha Hasnie, questioned the impact of her expressions: “So far... HARRIS is making faces way more than TRUMP on this split screen. DK how that's going to resonate with voters.”Critics even drew comparisons to past debates. “Harris displayed many of the same expressions that went viral during the 2020 vice presidential debate where she faced off against Mike Pence ,” noted journalist Ian Miles Cheong.","Kamala Harris' animated facial expressions captured the attention of viewers and commentators alike.

Following Swift's high-profile support for Harris, Musk playfully responded on X (formerly Twitter) with the comment, ""Fine Taylor … you win … I will give you a child and guard your cats with my life.""The remark quickly went viral, drawing attention to both Swift's political stance and Musk's lighthearted acknowledgment of her cultural influence.Swift's endorsement of Harris aligns with her history of backing Democratic candidates and progressive causes. Meanwhile, Musk, who frequently engages in political discourse on X, seemed to humorously concede to Swift's powerful influence, particularly among her passionate fanbase known as ""Swifties."" Musk’s comment appeared to recognize the sway Swift holds, especially with younger generations, in shaping public opinion.Swift's endorsement came shortly after the US presidential debate, with the singer posting on Instagram, ""I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election."" She shared her reaction to the debate with her 283 million followers, stating, ""I'm voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them.""This endorsement follows a controversy involving AI-generated images falsely portraying Swift and her fans as Trump supporters. Swift took the opportunity to address the dangers of misinformation, especially fueled by artificial intelligence. ""It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation,"" she noted, explaining her decision to publicly declare her political stance.Swift also encouraged her followers to do their own research on the candidates' positions. “I watched the debate and urge you to do your own research on the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter most to you,” she advised.In a witty parting note, Swift signed off her endorsement with ""Childless cat lady,"" a jab at a derogatory comment made by Republican vice-presidential candidate JD Vance in 2021. Vance had referred to senior Democrats as “a bunch of childless cat ladies” in an interview with Tucker Carlson, a remark Swift addressed directly in her closing statement.","Elon Musk responded to Taylor Swift's endorsement of Kamala Harris for the 2024 US presidential election.

After the heated debate between the presidential candidates vice president Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump , political analyst accused ABC News of being biased and giving soft treatment to the Democratic nominee over her flip, flop policy.Mark Halperin, a journalist and former political director at ABC News, alleged that the media was shielding Harris at all costs.He criticised the moderators' gentle handling of Harris' policy inconsistencies, calling it the ""biggest failure of the night.""During a livestream on his media platform 2WAY on Wednesday, Halperin said, ""Not only was one news organization fully on board to continue through Election Day protecting her at all costs, but we saw in the coverage of the debate, which was laughably uneven, no recognition that it was laughably uneven. In fact, mostly praise for how great a job ABC did.""He added, ""Bigger to me, was last night was the best — and if the Harris campaign continues to hide her, maybe only chance — to get her to explain her issue position changes. That to me was the biggest failure.""The perceived bias of ABC debate co-moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis drew criticism from various analysts.

Residents describe storm as ‘little scary’

Third hurricane in US this year

Hurricane Francine hit Louisiana on Wednesday evening as a Category 2 storm, cutting power to roughly 190,000 customers and causing severe flooding along the Gulf Coast. The storm made landfall in Terrebonne Parish , southwest of Morgan City, with winds near 100 mph.Francine's eye made landfall at 5 pm CT in Terrebonne Parish, driving hurricane-force winds inland toward southern Louisiana near Baton Rouge.According to Morgan City Fire chief Alvin Cockerham, significant damage including flooded streets, downed power lines, and broken tree limbs was reported in Louisiana. “It’s a little bit worse than what I expected, to be honest with you,” he said. “It’s too dangerous to be out there in this.”The National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecasts that Francine will gradually turn northward, moving across southeastern Louisiana and southwestern and central Mississippi on Thursday. The storm's impacts could extend hundreds of miles outward, even as its center moves inland.Francine was the sixth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season and rapidly strengthened before landfall. The storm has increased the risk of tornadoes and severe thunderstorms, with conditions expected to last into Friday morning.The National Hurricane Center advised residents to remain indoors as Francine moved inland. The storm was expected to pass near New Orleans and weaken as it travels northeast through Mississippi, bringing heavy rain and potential flash flooding to several cities. Brad Reinhart, a senior hurricane specialist, warned that some areas could see up to 12 inches of rain.Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry said the National Guard would assist affected areas with food, water, vehicles, boats, and helicopters for search and rescue.President Joe Biden granted an emergency declaration for Louisiana, and states of emergency were declared by the governors of Louisiana and Mississippi.The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency distributed over 100,000 sandbags to the southern part of the state, and several schools were closed.Governor Landry said, ""After declaring a state of emergency, we have now determined that this storm is of such severity that an effective response is beyond the capabilities of the state and local governments. This federal assistance is needed to save lives and property.""Airlines canceled flights into and out of Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport through Thursday morning.Coastal communities faced high waves, flooded streets, and strong winds. Power outages were widespread in southeast Louisiana, affecting coastal parishes and neighboring areas.Laura Leftwich , sheltering at her mother’s home, saw birdhouses swept away by the wind and shared video footage of street flooding with friends. “It’s a little scary,” she said.Resident Luis Morfin sought shelter at a friend’s home, leaving his camper outside the levee. “We knew what we were expecting,” he said.Francine is the third hurricane to hit the continental US this year. Earlier in the season, Hurricane Beryl made landfall in Matagorda, Texas, on July 8 as a Category 1 storm. Hurricane Debby followed on August 5, also as a Category 1 storm, hitting near Steinhatchee, Florida.A Tornado Watch was issued for much of Louisiana and southern Mississippi through Wednesday evening as storm bands moved in from the Gulf of Mexico.","Hurricane Francine hit Louisiana on Wednesday evening as a Category 2 storm.

Kamala makes expressions her weapon while Trump yells into mic,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-makes-expressions-her-weapon-while-trump-yells-into-mic/articleshow/113275268.cms,"She turned to him with an arched brow. A quiet sigh. A hand on her chin. A laugh. A pitiful glance. A dismissive shake of her head. From the opening moments of her first debate against Donald Trump Kamala Harris craftily exploited her opponent's biggest weakness. Not his record. Not his divisive policies. Not his history of inflammatory statements. Instead, she took aim at a far more primal part of him: his ego.At his rallies, on his sycophantic social media network and surrounded by flatterers at Mar-a-Lago, Trump is unquestioned, unchallenged and never ever mocked.That changed over the course of 90 minutes in Philadelphia on Tuesday, when the woman who had never before met him succeeded, bit by bit, in puncturing his comfortable cocoon and triggering his annoyance and anger. Harris questioned the size and loyalty of the crowds at his rallies. And she claimed his fortune was built by his father, recasting a business mogul who proudly boasts of being a self-made man as just another nepotism baby.Harris warned that world leaders were ""laughing at Donald Trump"" and saw him as a ""disgrace"". And when she referred to his 2020 election loss as the moment he was ""fired by 81 million people"", he grew visibly angry. Then she stood by and watched, as Trump did himself a whole lot of damage. Trump expressed his feelings by yelling into the microphone.In answer after answer, the former prez reminded Americans of his role in so much of what many would rather forget: the deadly and devastating pandemic, his refusal to accept the results of the 2020 election, a bloody siege on the US Capitol and the fall of Roe v. Wade. He lingered on his criminal charges and praised Viktor Orban, the strongman leader of Hungary. He defended a false claim that migrants in Ohio are eating their neighbours' dogs and cats and recycled years-old anti-abortion attack lines that Democrats supported ""execution after birth"".When Harris brought up his criminal convictions, Trump accused Democrats of turning the judicial system against him: ""I probably took a bullet to the head because of the things that they say about me."" ""He is so easy to trigger,"" Governor Gavin Newsom of California, a Harris ally, said in the post-debate spin room.From the moment Harris crossed the stage to shake Trump's hand, the Democratic prez nominee made clear her intention to transform a night expected to be about her into a referendum on him. She displayed a composure and tactical restraint that was palpable through the television screen. Equally palpable was his fury, which at times seemed to make him unable to even look at his opponent. ""She's a Marxist - everybody knows she's a Marxist,"" Trump said when Harris accused him of coddling China during the pandemic. ""Her father is a Marxist professor in economics, and he taught her well."" Harris looked at him with a condescending smile, performatively leaning in to hear more. He's the former reality TV star, but she clearly understood the power of the medium. Her expression was her rebuttal.As the governors, senators, activists and political gadflies spun his performance in the post-debate spin room, a surprise guest suddenly appeared and was swarmed by more than 100 journalists. It was Trump. Prez candidates rarely - if ever - spin their own performances in the minutes after exiting the stage. But Trump couldn't let it go. ""It was,"" he said, ""my best debate ever.""

US aircraft carrier in the Middle East is heading home,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-aircraft-carrier-in-the-middle-east-is-heading-home/articleshow/113274985.cms,"WASHINGTON: The Pentagon's rare move to keep two Navy aircraft carriers in the Middle East over the past several weeks has now finished, as the USS Theodore Roosevelt is heading home, according to US officials.US defense secretary Lloyd Austin had ordered the Roosevelt to extend its deployment for a short time and remain in the region as the USS Abraham Lincoln was pushed to get to the area more quickly.The Biden administration beefed up the US military presence there to help defend Israel from possible attacks by Iran and its proxies and to safeguard US troops.US commanders in the Middle East have long argued that the presence of a US aircraft carrier and the warships accompanying it has been an effective deterrent in the region, particularly for Iran. Since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip began last fall, there has been a persistent carrier presence in and around the region - and for short periods they have overlapped to have two of the carriers there at the same time.Prior to last fall, however, it had been years since the US had committed that much warship power to the region.The decision to bring the Roosevelt home comes as the war in Gaza has dragged on for 11 months, with tens of thousands of people dead, and international efforts to mediate a cease-fire between Israel and the Hamas militant group have repeatedly stalled as they accuse each other of making additional and unacceptable demands.For a number of months earlier this year the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower remained in the Red Sea, able both to respond to help Israel and to defend commercial and military ships from attacks by the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen. The carrier, based in Norfolk, Virginia, returned home after an over eight-month deployment in combat that the Navy said was the most intense since World War II.US officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss troop movements, said the San Diego-based Roosevelt and the USS Daniel Inouye, a destroyer, are expected to be in the Indo-Pacific Command's region on Thursday. The other destroyer in the strike group, the USS Russell, had already left the Middle East and has been operating in the South China Sea.The Lincoln, which is now in the Gulf of Oman with several other warships, arrived in the Middle East about three weeks ago, allowing it to overlap with the Roosevelt until now.There also are a number of US ships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, and two destroyers and the guided missile submarine USS Georgia are in the Red Sea.","US commanders in the Middle East have long argued that the presence of a US aircraft carrier and the warships accompanying it has been an effective deterrent in the region.

Not Springfield , Ohio.Its story of economic renewal and related growing pains has been thrust into the national conversation in a presidential election year - and maliciously distorted by false rumors that Haitian immigrants are eating their neighbors' pets.Donald Trump amplified those lies during Tuesday's nationally televised debate, exacerbating some residents' fears about growing divisiveness in the predominantly white, blue-collar city of about 60,000.At the city's Haitian Community Help and Support Center on Wednesday, Rose-Thamar Joseph said many of the roughly 15,000 immigrants who arrived in the past few years were drawn by good jobs and the city's relative affordability. But a rising sense of unease has crept in as longtime residents increasingly bristle at newcomers taking jobs at factories, driving up housing costs, worsening traffic and straining city services.""Some of them are talking about living in fear. Some of them are scared for their life,"" Joseph said.A ""Welcome To Our City"" sign hangs from a parking garage downtown, where a coffee shop, bakery and boutique line Springfield's main drag, North Fountain Street. A flag advertising ""CultureFest,"" the city's annual celebration of unity through diversity, waves from a pole nearby.Melanie Flax Wilt , a Republican commissioner in the county where Springfield is located, said she has been pushing for community and political leaders to ""stop feeding the fear.""""After the election and everybody's done using Springfield, Ohio, as a talking point for immigration reform, we are going to be the ones here still living through the challenges and coming up with the solutions,"" she said.Ariel Dominique, executive director of the Haitian American Foundation for Democracy, said she laughed at first at the absurdity of the false claims. But seeing the comments repeated on national television by the former president was painful.""It is so unfair and unjust and completely contrary to what we have contributed to the world, what we have contributed to this nation for so long,"" Dominique said.The falsehoods about Springfield's Haitian immigrants were spread online by Trump's running mate, JD Vance , on the eve of Tuesday's debate between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris . It's part of a timeworn American political tradition of casting immigrants as outsiders.""This is what's happening in our country. And it's a shame,"" Trump said at the debate after repeating the falsehoods. When challenged by ABC News moderator David Muir over the false claims, Trump held firm, saying ""people on television"" said their dogs were eaten, but he offered no evidence.Officials in Springfield have tried to tamp down the misinformation by saying there have been no credible or detailed reports of any pets being abducted or eaten. State leaders are trying to help address some of the real challenges facing the city.Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine , a Republican, said Tuesday he would add more law enforcement and health care resources to an aid package the state has already provided to Springfield.Many Haitians have come to the US to flee poverty and violence. They have embraced President Joe Biden 's new and expanded legal pathways to enter, and have shunned illegal crossings, accounting for only 92 border arrests out of more than 56,000 in July, the latest data available.The Biden administration recently announced an estimated 300,000 Haitians in the US could remain in the country at least through February 2026, with eligibility for work authorization, under a law called Temporary Protected Status. The goal is to spare people from being deported to countries in turmoil.Springfield, about 45 miles from the state capital of Columbus, suffered a steep decline in its manufacturing sector toward the end of the last century, and its population shrank as a result. But its downtown has been revitalized in recent years as more Haitians arrived and helped meet the rising demand for labor as the economy emerged from the pandemic. Officials say Haitians now account for about 15% of the population.The city was shaken last year when a minivan slammed into a school bus, killing an 11-year-old boy. The driver was a Haitian man who recently settled in the area and was driving without a valid license. During a city commission meeting on Tuesday, the boy's parents condemned politicians' use of their son's death to stoke hatred.Last week, a post on the social media platform X shared what looked like a screengrab of a social media post apparently out of Springfield. The post claimed without evidence that the person's ""neighbor's daughter's friend"" saw a cat hanging from a tree to be butchered and eaten, outside a house where it claimed Haitians lived. It was accompanied by a photo of a Black man carrying what appeared to be a goose by its feet.On Monday, Vance posted on X: ""Reports now show that people have had their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn't be in this country."" The next day, he posted again, saying his office had received inquiries from Springfield residents who said ""their neighbors' pets or local wildlife were abducted by Haitian migrants.""Long-time Springfield resident Chris Hazel, who knows the park and neighborhood where the pet and goose abductions were purported to have happened, called the claims ""preposterous.""""It reminds me of when people used to accuse others and outsiders as cannibals. It's dehumanizing a community,"" he said of the accusations against the city's Haitian residents.Sophia Pierrilus , the daughter of a former Haitian diplomat who moved to the Ohio capital of Columbus 15 years ago and is now an immigrant advocate, agreed, calling it all political.""My view is that's their way to use Haitians as a scapegoat to bring some kind of chaos in America,"" she said.With its rising population of immigrants, Springfield is hardly an outlier. So far this decade, immigration has accounted for almost three-quarters of US population growth, with 2.5 million immigrants arriving in the United States between 2020 and 2023, according to the US Census Bureau. Population growth is an important driver of economic growth.""The Haitian immigrants who started moving to Springfield the last few years are the reason why the economy and the labor force has been revitalized there,"" said Guerline Jozef, executive director of the Haitian Bridge Alliance, which provides legal and social services to immigrants across the USNow, she said, Haitians in Springfield have told her that, out of fear, they are considering leaving the city.","Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, account for about 15% of the city's population. Many of the roughly 15,000 immigrants who arrived in the past few years were drawn by good jobs.

Alberto Fujimori , the former president of Peru , has died at the age of 86 after a prolonged battle with cancer, according to his daughter's post on X.""After a long battle with cancer, our father, Alberto Fujimori , has just departed to meet the Lord. We ask those who loved him to accompany us with a prayer for the eternal rest of his soul. Thanks for so much dad! Keiko, Hiro, Sachie and Kenji Fujimori ,"" daughter Keiko Fujimori said.He was born July 28, 1938, coinciding with Peruvian Independence Day, and his immigrant parents picked cotton until they could open a tailor’s shop in downtown Lima, AP News agency reported.He earned a degree in agricultural engineering in 1956, and then studied in France and the United States, where he received a graduate degree in mathematics from the University of Wisconsin in 1972.In 1984 he became rector of the Agricultural University in Lima, and six years later, he ran for president without ever having held political office, billing himself as a clean alternative to Peru’s corrupt, discredited political class.Fujimori's presidency, spanning from 1990 to 2000, was marked by significant events. He inherited a country plagued by hyperinflation and guerrilla violence, which he addressed through bold economic reforms and the defeat of the Shining Path rebels.However, his government collapsed in 2000 due to a corruption scandal involving his spy chief, Vladimiro Montesinos . Fujimori sought exile in Japan, his parents' country of origin, and later faced arrest in Chile and extradition to Peru.In 2009, Fujimori was sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights crimes, becoming the first democratically elected Latin American president to be convicted of such offenses in his own country, Reuters reported.The charges stemmed from his role in ordering military death squads to carry out two massacres that claimed 25 lives during his presidency, amidst the conflict with communist guerrillas that resulted in nearly 70,000 deaths over two decades in Peru.He had been pardoned in December. Despite his conviction, Fujimori's daughter announced in July that he planned to run for Peru's presidency for the fourth time in 2026.“My father and I have talked and decided together that he will be the presidential candidate,” Keiko Fujimori, leader of the right-wing Fuerza Popular party, said on social networks, as per AP news agency.However, Peruvian law prohibits individuals found guilty of corruption from running for the office of president or vice president.","Alberto Fujimori, the former president of Peru, has died at the age of 86 after a prolonged battle with cancer.

AI image generated by Grok-2

In a notable moment during Tuesday night’s presidential debate, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump shared a handshake, marking their first face-to-face meeting in the campaign.As the debate began, both candidates took the stage for what was their initial direct encounter. Initially, Trump seemed to head towards his podium without acknowledging Harris, who was approaching the center of the stage.In a gesture of politeness, Harris altered her path to meet Trump at his podium, extending her hand.“Kamala Harris. How are you?” Harris greeted.“Nice to see you, I'm fine,” Trump responded as he shook her hand.“Let’s have a good debate,” Harris replied.The handshake signified the end of an eight-year period without handshakes on the presidential debate stage. Although there are no formal rules or stipulations requiring such gestures, this exchange added a touch of civility to the high-stakes political confrontation.Kamala Harris and Donald Trump faced off for the first time in what might be their only debate before the November presidential election, offering a dramatic glimpse into their contrasting visions for the country. The debate came after a tumultuous summer for both candidates and presented a critical opportunity to sway undecided voters.The encounter provided Americans with their clearest view yet of a campaign that has shifted significantly since the last debate in June, which saw President Joe Biden withdraw from the race. Harris immediately targeted Trump, linking him to the conservative Project 2025 agenda and GOP efforts to restrict abortion access, while also criticizing his inflammatory rhetoric.Trump countered by questioning Harris’s effectiveness as vice president and attacking her handling of illegal migration. He made several contentious claims about migrants, including an assertion that they are “taking jobs” from African Americans and Hispanics. Harris, seemingly unfazed, responded with a smirk when Trump repeated baseless accusations about immigrants.The debate took place in a small, blue-lit amphitheater turned television studio, devoid of a live audience, which minimized the typical noise of applause or jeers. The close proximity of the candidates’ lecterns highlighted the intensity of the debate.Following the June 27 debate, which led to Biden’s exit from the race, Trump survived an assassination attempt, and both sides finalized their running mates. This debate, hosted by ABC News, represents a rare instance of sustained questioning for Harris, who has given only one formal interview in the past six weeks.Early ballots for the presidential race are set to be distributed just hours after the debate, with absentee ballots beginning to go out in Alabama on Wednesday.",Kamala Harris and Donald Trump faced off for the first time in what might be their only debate before the November presidential election.

Current status:

Allexis Telia Ferrell , a 27-year-old from Canton, Ohio , has become a controversial figure following her recent arrest for allegedly killing and consuming a cat. The disturbing case has not only sparked outrage but also fueled an unusual online trend involving Donald Trump memes.Ferrell was arrested on September 6, 2024, after witnesses reported that she stomped on a cat’s head before eating it in front of residents.Charged with animal cruelty , including injuring animals, prohibitions concerning companion animals, and disorderly conduct, Ferrell’s bond was set at $100,000.The case has generated significant media attention and public outcry. Right-wing social media accounts have bizarrely linked Ferrell's actions to unfounded claims about illegal Haitian migrants consuming pets and wild birds in Springfield, Ohio. This connection has led to the creation of AI-generated memes depicting Donald Trump holding cats and ducks, reflecting the surreal nature of the situation.In response to the controversy, Trump’s campaign issued a statement that read, “President Trump will deport migrants who eat pets. Kamala Harris will send them to your town next. Make your choice, America.” This statement highlights the campaign’s use of sensationalist narratives to rally support.JD Vance , Trump’s running mate and Ohio Senator, also reacted to the situation. “Months ago, I raised the issue of Haitian illegal immigrants draining social services and generally causing chaos all over Springfield, Ohio,” Vance tweeted. He continued, “Reports now show that people have had their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn’t be in this country.”Ferrell remains in custody as her case progresses through the legal system.

Jennifer Jones , a spokesperson for the Houston County School District , said that authorities were alerted to a possible gunman. Law enforcement quickly arrived at the scene and conducted a sweep of the school. Fortunately, no evidence of an armed individual was found. ""Law enforcement immediately arrived, and after a complete sweep, the school was cleared, and normal operations resumed,"" Jones told WMaz Tv.Following the search, the school returned to a 'code green,' meaning safety protocols were lifted, and students were dismissed under police supervision. A message was sent to parents informing them of the situation. Jones reassured the community, stating that an investigation is ongoing and updates would be provided as more information becomes available.The lockdown has sparked concern among parents and school officials, especially given the rise in school-related threats across Georgia since the Apalachee High School tragedy.
