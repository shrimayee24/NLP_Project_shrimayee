New Delhi: National Investigation Agency ( NIA ) on Wednesday arrested gangster Lawrence Bishnoi 's brother, Anmol, upon his deportation from US. He arrived here on a special flight around 2pm, was produced in court and taken on a remand of 11 days.The agency arrested him in a case registered in 2022 to investigate an alleged nexus between criminal gangs in India and Babbar Khalsa International (BKI), a designated terrorist organisation, to raise funds, recruit youths and carry out terror strikes in the country.Anmol was accused of providing shelter and logistic support to shooters of the gangs and ground operatives in America. ""He was also allegedly engaged in extortion in India from foreign soil with the help of other gangsters,"" NIA said. The agency intends to ascertain details of social media accounts through which the Lawrence Bishnoi group has been taking responsibility for various crimes.Following his NIA custody, Anmol is likely to be handed over to police in Mumbai and Punjab in connection with the murder cases of NCP neta Baba Siddique and rapper Sidhu Moose Wala.Anmol's family claimed that he is being punished for his brother's crimes. ""I request the PM and home minister to ensure Anmol's security.The way gang war is happening, we are apprehensive... Our family has always respected the law. Whether Anmol is a culprit... it is part of the inquiry. His biggest crime is that he is the younger brother of Lawrence, but he has never been involved in the world of crime,"" said his cousin, Ramesh Bishnoi.Urging NIA to ensure his safety, the court ordered Anmol's medical examination to be conducted every 48 hours and his journey from court to the agency headquarters and vice versa video-recorded on completion of remand. NIA was asked to submit a report on measures taken for his security.Anmol had been absconding since 2022, NIA said. ""He is the 19th accused to be arrested for his involvement in the terror-syndicate led by his jailed brother, Lawrence. Anmol was chargesheeted by NIA in March 2023 after investigation established that he had actively aided designated terrorist Goldy Brar and Lawrence in the commission of various acts of terrorism in the country between 2020 and 2023,"" the agency claimed.Operating closely with various Bishnoi gang associates, Anmol continued to run syndicates and execute acts of terror from US, using the gang's operatives on the ground, NIA said.Anmol was detained in California's Sacramento last Nov for illegal entry after which FBI confirmed his identity through DNA and voice sample matches. He sought asylum while he was lodged at Pottawattamie County prison in Iowa. The facility's website showed he was being investigated by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which deals with cross-border crimes and undocumented immigration in US.An incident of firing at actor Salman Khan's house in Mumbai in April last year put Anmol under the lens. A Facebook account, purportedly belonging to him, claimed responsibility for the incident. Later, police chanced upon an audio recording of a conversation purportedly between Anmol and Vicky Gupta, one of the shooters.On Oct 12, 2024, Siddique was gunned down outside the Bandra (East) office of his MLA son, Zeeshan. Anmol was named in a chargesheet filed by Mumbai Police. Soon, NIA announced a reward of Rs 10 lakh for information leading to his arrest.Anmol was also accused of providing arms and logistical support to the shooters of Moose Wala. He had allegedly fled India on a forged passport in the name of Bhanu Pratap a month before the rapper was killed on May 29, 2022.","Lawrence Bishnoi's brother, Anmol, arrested upon his deportation from US.

SC: 3 talaqs sent through lawyer not valid,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-3-talaqs-sent-through-lawyer-not-valid/articleshow/125450139.cms,"Dr. Imam Ahmed Illyasi Explains Triple Talaq: Role Of Muslim Men & Women Revealed

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday questioned the validity of the practice among Muslim men to authorise a lawyer to send notices to his wife for divorce through three talaqs, each notified after a month’s gap, and said this would not be regarded as a valid annulment of marriage as the notices do not bear the man’s signature.Appearing for a TV journalist petitioner questioning the Muslim men’s unilateral right to divorce through triple talaq under Talaq-e-Hasan process, senior advocate Rizwan Ahmed told a bench of CJI-designate Surya Kant and Justices U Bhuyan and N K Singh that her advocate husband sent talaq notices through a lawyer, finalised divorce and remarried.“When a talaqnama does not bear the husband’s signature, it is not a valid divorce document. If, based on this document, the woman remarries, the man can later accuse her of polyandry by claiming he has not validly divorced the woman. Moreover, whenever she wants to remarry, the other man can decline citing the invalidity of the divorce document,” Ahmed said.When senior advocate M R Shamshad attempted to justify the advocate husband’s action terming it as a custom prevalent among Muslims, Justice Kant-led bench asked, “How can this be a valid practice? The notices for talaq and talaqnama must have the signature of the husband. How can a third party give the woman notice on behalf of her husband?”“Is this legal? How are such innovations made to give talaq? How is the community promoting such practices? We will not permit such processes to harm the dignity of the Muslim women.No one can give authorisation to a lawyer or any other person to give talaq notice to a woman on his behalf. If tomorrow the husband says he has not authorised the lawyer, what will happen to the woman? We have seen in many cases where the clients have disowned lawyers’ action,” the bench said.Deprecating the actions of the advocate-husband, the bench asked him to follow the Sharia law procedures and give a valid divorce to the woman, Benazeer Heena, who was present in court and narrated how she had been made to run from pillar to post after being virtually abandoned by her husband after paying a total alimony of Rs 17,000. SC asked her to file an application seeking appropriate directions for her and child’s welfare and education. “We will do the needful,” it assured.Turning to Shamshad, Justice Kant said, “We salute her for gathering courage to move the court challenging the unilateral Talaq-e-Hasan process of divorce. Think of the condition of millions of Muslim women, illiterate and living in rural areas. What would be their plight? The relief cannot be confined to those women who have the wherewithal to move the SC. We will decide the validity of Talaq-e-Hasan after a detailed hearing. ”","Supreme Court questions validity of practice among Muslim men to authorise a lawyer to send notices to his wife for divorce through three talaqs.

SRINAGAR: All Kashmiris were being looked at with suspicion in other parts of India because of the actions of a few, Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah on Wednesday said, adding that even he hesitated going out in Delhi in a J&K registered vehicle.Hitting out at the Centre and the LG administration, he said stripping J&K of its special status and statehood had not ended bloodshed, and those responsible for the UT’s security should answer for the current situation.The chief minister, while addressing a gathering in Kulgam, said the situation had deteriorated to the point that Kashmiri parents hesitated to send their children to other states for studies or jobs. “When fingers of suspicion are pointed at us from all sides, when actions of a few are used to defame all of us, when everyone is dragged into it because of the involvement of a few, it is difficult for us to leave J&K,” he said.Some of the Delhi car blast perpetrators and other suspects arrested in the white-collar terror module recently busted are from Kashmir.“Look at what happened in Delhi. A few were responsible but the impression is being created that all of us are to blame for it and all of us are involved in it.Today, driving a J&K-registered vehicle in Delhi is treated almost like a crime. When I’m not surrounded by security personnel, I wonder whether I should even drive my J&K-registered car or not. I fear being stopped and questioned,” he said.The CM was in Kulgam to visit the families of some of the victims of Friday’s blast inside Nowgam police station in Srinagar that killed a Special Investigation Agency officer, three FSL personnel, two revenue officials and a tailor associated with the station, and wounded 30 others.It was the Nowgam police station that probed the Jaish-e-Mohammad posters that appeared in Bonpora area on Oct 19, which led to the uncovering of the interstate terror module involving doctors and others.“What should we say about the situation today? If a bomb is not exploding in Delhi, it’s going off here,” the CM said. “Innocent people are losing their lives. Yesterday, I went to five homes to offer condolences and today I am visiting two more. We want this vicious cycle of violence to stop somewhere.”“In the past 30-35 years, we have witnessed blood and gore on a massive scale in the Valley. We were told it will end and that after 2019, the situation has improved. But it hasn’t, and why it hasn’t is a question for those responsible for our security.

EC orders Special Revision of Assam’s electoral rolls







NEW DELHI: With the state of Assam set to go to assembly polls next year, political sparring between the BJP and Congress has intensified, with both sides staking claim to a clear win in the 2026 showdown.Speaking to reporters in Dhubri, Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi said the BJP is on its way to defeat in the next state elections. Gaurav alleged that the ruling party carried out the 2023 delimitation exercise in a way that ""only benefited the BJP"" and is now introducing the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) as it fears losing seats.""BJP is heading for defeat in 2026 (Assam Assembly election) if only Assamese people vote; we urge people to stay alert so no voters from UP and Bihar can vote,"" Gogoi said.The 2023 delimitation raised Scheduled Caste seats from eight to nine and Scheduled Tribe seats from 16 to 19, while keeping the total assembly seats unchanged at 126. As per reports analysts say the number of Muslim-dominated seats has reduced from 30 to 22 under the redrawn map, which will be used in the 2026 elections.Addressing a rally in Nalbari, Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma escalated his attack on Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi, saying the Congress leader would ""hundred per cent lose"" the upcoming state polls.""He (Gogoi) will hundred per cent lose the polls in Assam, and then he can contest the elections in Pakistan,"" Sarma said, responding to Gogoi's earlier comments on the political climate in the state further adding that, ""Assam is Assam and we will make a clean sweep in the assembly elections.”Sarma also accused the Congress of ""doing politics"" over the death of singer Zubeen Garg to ""protect the Miyas who have encroached acres of land across the state.”The chief minister has repeatedly targeted Gogoi in recent months, alleging links with Pakistan’s ISI and forming an SIT to probe the matter, though its findings have not yet been made public.Sarma further claimed that ""the Congress is mainly concerned about 'Miyas', and the people of Assam will not vote for those who support them.”He also announced that the government will introduce the anti-polygamy bill in the upcoming assembly session. ""We will present the anti-polygamy bill in the assembly in November,"" Sarma stated.The Election Commission on Monday ordered a Special Revision of the electoral rolls in Assam ahead of the 2026 elections. Earlier on Tuesday, Sarma, reiterating the need for updated rolls, said that the exercise would help identify and remove ineligible voters.He noted that the state's National Register of Citizens (NRC) has not been notified ""due to various legacy issues,"" and that the Special Intensive Revision has therefore been deferred.However, with the Election Commission now ordering a Special Revision, Sarma said the process ""will help us weed out the illegal (voters) from our electoral process.”.According to EC guidelines issued to the state’s chief electoral officer, January 1, 2026, has been set as the qualifying date for the Special Revision. Officials said the drive is positioned between the usual annual summary revision and a full Special Intensive Revision (SIR).Last month, the Election Commission had ordered SIR in 12 states and Union Territories, including four set to vote next year.","The Election Commission on Monday ordered a Special Revision of the electoral rolls in Assam ahead of the 2026 elections.

Candace Owens Makes Shocking Egyptian Planes Claim In Charlie Kirk Case

Candace Owens says flight signals, rental cars, and timing raise new questions

Operation Mocking-Plane: The Charlie Kirk Plot Thickens. | Candace Ep 266





Candace Owens says she has many serious questions about the killing of Charlie Kirk. She talked about this again in her podcast on November 17. She said she found new details that made her even more worried. Candace Owens said two Egyptian planes showed up many times near Erika Kirk, Charlie Kirk’s wife. She said these planes showed up at places where Erika Kirk was 73 times from 2022 to September 2025. She said she found these numbers after checking the work of a woman online, whom she called a “pregnant mommy sleuth.”She said the woman was right. Candace Owens said 29 of those overlaps also had Charlie Kirk in the same place. She said both planes were also at the Provo airport on September 10, the day Charlie Kirk was shot near Utah Valley University. She said one plane took off, and the other stayed on the ground with its power on.Candace Owens said the two planes were the yellow SU-BTT and the blue SU-BND. She said these flights mostly matched Erika Kirk’s movements inside five U.S. states but also matched her travel overseas. She said one plane at the Provo airport sent out a signal from 9:05 a.m.until 10:34 a.m. on September 10. She said its signal turned on again 17 minutes after Charlie Kirk was shot at 12:40 p.m., and stayed on until 1:29 p.m.Candace Owens said she believed this signal came from data on ADS-B Exchange. She also said the flight was “transponding” at Duncan Aviation. She said she saw claims online from MJTruthUltra that Duncan Aviation gave rental cars to people linked to the Egyptian planes. She even read out the car details and asked if anyone had seen them.Candace Owens said the plane could have been doing normal maintenance. She also said the plane might have tools to make private satellite calls. She said these ideas were only her guesses.Also Read: Candace Owens sparks chaos with new Britney Spears trafficking claim as Lou Taylor link trends after Kim Kardashian video Candace Owens said Turning Point USA knew about these flights and should explain why the planes were there.

The US House on Tuesday passed a bill compelling the justice department to release the classified files linked to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

He also chairs a subcommittee that initiated a subpoena on the Justice Department for the Epstein files.This comes after President Donald Trump walked back months of opposition to opening a case file tied to one of the country's most notorious scandals.A separate investigation conducted by the House Oversight Committee has released thousands of pages of emails and other documents from Epstein's estate, showing his connections to global leaders, Wall Street powerbrokers, influential political figures and Trump himself. In the United Kingdom, King Charles III stripped his disgraced brother Prince Andrew of his remaining titles and evicted him from his royal residence after pressure to act over his relationship with Epstein.Pushing for more accountability, the survivors of Epstein's abuse cast the current effort in Congress as a step towards accountability for Epstein's crimes after years of government failure under multiple presidential administrations.Meanwhile, Donald Trump had urged Republican lawmakers to vote to release files, saying that he and his party have nothing to hide.While talking to reporters, Trump on Monday said that Epstein was connected to more Democrats and that he didn't want the Epstein files to “detract from the great success of the Republican Party.”Still, many in the Republican base have continued to demand the release of the files. Adding to that pressure, several survivors of Epstein's abuse rallied outside the Capitol Tuesday morning.

Kerala: RSS Worker Dies By Suicide After BJP Denies Local Body Poll Ticket In Thiruvananthapuram

NEW DELHI: A day after a Class 10 student from a private school in central Delhi died by suicide by jumping from the Rajendra Place Metro Station, police registered a case of abetment to suicide on Wednesday based on a complaint submitted by the student's father.The father named a school teacher and three other teachers for harassing his son. He told the police that the family lives in Rajendra Nagar and works in the jewellery business. He stated that his 16-year-old son repeatedly complained that several teachers—including the school principal, coordinator, and two other staff members—often scolded him over minor issues and allegedly subjected him to mental harassment.A suicide note was also recovered from the spot, in which the boy apologised to his parents and expressed a wish for his body to be donated to someone in need.

They said that the teacher even pushed his son. On November 18, during the class, when his son slipped and fell, the teacher insulted him in front of everyone and said he was overacting and creating drama.

‘I handed him his first weapon’: Chhattisgarh teen who chose the gun; how Hidma became India’s most-feared Maoist leader,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/i-handed-him-his-first-weapon-man-who-recruited-hidma-to-maoist-movement-says-a-teen-from-remote-puvarti-became-indias-most-wanted-commander/articleshow/125443665.cms,"“Hidma was the kind who, if killed in an encounter, would kill 2–3 first”

RAIPUR: A former Maoist who once roamed the same forests as Madvi Hidma has revealed how one of India’s most notorious insurgent commanders was first recruited into the outlawed movement — not by choice, but by circumstance, opportunity, and a senior cadre’s eye for 'talent'.Badranna, a surrendered Maoist who laid down arms in 2000 and now works as a gardener with the Jagdalpur Municipal Corporation, told a local Bastar reporter that he was the one who inducted Hidma into the Maoist ranks when the boy was barely 15–16 years old.“I was the first to pick him for the Maoist organisation,” Badranna said. “I handed him his first weapon.”Chhattisgarh police records verifies the fact that it was Badranna who had recruited Hidma to the banned outfit.Recalling the late 1990s in Sukma’s Puvarti village, Badranna said he was then a deputy commander tasked with building an area platoon for the Maoist outfit. During visits to Puvarti, where he worked with villagers to dig a pond, he noticed a tall, wiry tribal boy who would quietly stand and watch with curiosity.“That was the first time I saw him — tall, strong body, sharp eyes,” Badranna said. “I knew he was fit for the movement.He didn’t come asking to join; I went to him. I took him into the Bal Sangham as a child soldier.”Hidma, he said, had no moustache then, was recently married, and showed early signs of grit — “jujharu enough to go up in ranks.” Within a week of joining, he was moved into the platoon.“He had no idea what the party (organisation) was, how it worked, or what outcome awaited him. He joined because he saw me, a fellow tribal, and trusted me,” Badranna added with visible regret.Even years after leaving the movement, Badranna said he had always believed that if Hidma ever died in a gunbattle, it would not happen without him taking down at least two or three lives.“That’s the kind of fighter he was,” he said.When news of Hidma’s death in Andhra Pradesh flashed on television, Badranna said the shock hit hard.“My wife called me around 3 pm yesterday. I rushed and switched on the TV,” he recalled. “I spent many years with him. Since yesterday, I have been sad. He was a poor tribal boy… I am also a tribal. He joined the party because of me.”Reacting to the viral image of Hidma’s body after the encounter, Badranna admitted he initially doubted its authenticity.“When I first saw the picture, my thought was — this doesn’t look like him. He looked different. Even the uniform he was wearing looked new,” he said. “But later, I understood it was him.”He said it felt surreal that a boy from a remote, impoverished village in Sukma had risen to the highest levels of the Maoist hierarchy, becoming battalion commander and eventually a Central Committee member.“He came from a very small, remote place and reached the top as a tribal cadre,” he said. “He was a fast learner — that was his strength.”Badranna admitted feeling a sense of responsibility — even guilt — for having picked a village boy whose life would go on to be defined by bloodshed and violence.“There are others I recruited too, and they joined because of me,” he said.Despite his own surrender nearly 25 years ago, Badranna said he never attempted to reach out to Hidma or advise him to quit the movement.“As per party rules, Maoists can ask people to join the movement, but can never ask anyone to surrender,” he explained. “After I surrendered, I cut off contact completely.”He also revealed that when he surrendered in 2000, he declared publicly that the Maoist outfit had sent him “as a sample” to show how a surrendered Maoist would be treated — a claim that raised eyebrows within security circles at the time.As Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh police confirm the identity of the slain Maoist, the man who first handed him a weapon now watches from afar — a recruiter who knows he helped set in motion a life that could end only in the way most Maoist lives do: violently, abruptly, and far from home.","Former Maoist reveals how Madvi Hidma was first recruited into the outlawed movement.

By: Ismat.ara

DADRI: It's been 10 years since Ikraman has stepped into Bisada. She hasn't returned to the village, just 49km from Delhi, since her husband, Mohammad Akhlaq, was dragged out of their home and lynched on Sept 28, 2015, after a rumour that he had slaughtered a cow and stored beef in his fridge. Her younger son, Danish, was left critically injured.Ikraman says she's been waiting for justice for 10 years. But recently, the news arrived that the UP govt had moved to withdraw the case against all the men accused of killing Akhlaq.Though a trial court will hear the plea on Dec 12, Akhlaq's family says it has not received a certified copy yet. What they know has come via their lawyer, Yusuf Saifi, who called the move ""legally unsound"" and said it would be challenged in Allahabad HC if granted.""This is a mob-lynching case. Eyewitnesses have deposed. You cannot apply routine templates here,"" he said. ""If withdrawal is allowed, it will wipe away 10 years of courtroom struggle in a single order.""Speaking to TOI, Ikraman said her ""grief has no rest"". It sits with her, every day, in the silence of a small flat she shares with her elder son in Agra. The years have worn her down but not dulled her memory. ""I lost everything. My husband, my home, my people. The world saw him dying. It saw those who killed him. So where is the justice?""After the initial outrage, the case moved slowly - the chargesheet came three months later, and it wasn't until 2021 that charges were formally framed, after repeated discharge pleas and pandemic delays.In total, 19 people were named, including a juvenile and the son of a local neta. One accused died in 2016; 18 remain, all out on bail. The police named 25 witnesses. Since 2022, the trial has seen five witnesses deposed, including Akhlaq's daughter Shaista. Danish, who underwent two brain surgeries and continues to struggle with his health, is expected to depose next.The family now fears it would all come to nothing. The state has filed a plea seeking to withdraw charges against all accused to ""promote social harmony"". It pointed to ""contradictions in witness accounts"" - citing the ""10 names given by Ikraman, 16 by Shaista, 19 by Danish"" - and said only sticks, rods and bricks were recovered, not the swords and pistols described by the family. It also cited the recovery of beef and a still-pending cow slaughter case against the family.In the Agra flat she rarely leaves, Ikraman says the legal fight has defined her family's last decade. ""We don't know the language of courts, we didn't know what to expect. But we waited through every hearing, every adjournment. It felt like our only duty.""She has not returned to Bisada since the attack. ""Everything ended for us there. There is no question of going back.""","Mohammad Akhlaq was lynched in Bisada, Uttar Pradesh, in September 2015. His wife, Ikraman, says she's been waiting for justice for 10 years.

‘CITY THAT DEVOURS MAYORS’: Zohran Mamdani Faces BRUTAL Reality Of Running NYC | EXPLAINED





US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that New York City’s mayor-elect, Zohran “Kwame” Mamdani, will meet him at the Oval Office on Friday, 21 November.In a post on Truth Social, the president wrote: “Communist Mayor of New York City, Zohran ‘Kwame’ Mamdani, has asked for a meeting. We have agreed that this meeting will take place at the Oval Office on Friday, November 21st. Further details to follow!”The meeting comes after months of sharp public clashes between the two leaders.According to The New York Times, Mamdani’s team reached out to White House officials last week to arrange a meeting revolving around New York’s affordability crisis, a move that marks a noticeable shift in tone.During his campaign, the mayor-elect had described Trump as a threat to democracy and argued that only he had the “backbone” to stand up to him.Trump, meanwhile, repeatedly labelled him a “100 per cent communist lunatic” and backed his rival, Andrew M Cuomo.Despite their differences, Mamdani has said he is willing to meet the president to address New York’s affordability crisis, as per The New York Times.He has argued that soaring living costs — including groceries and rent — are pushing residents out of the city. Speaking at a Bronx food pantry, he said that while voters were drawn to Trump’s promises to reduce costs, “we are seeing his actions and that of his administration in Washington leading to the exact opposite effect for New Yorkers.”As per The Guardian, Mamdani has stressed he is open to working with “anyone and everyone” if it benefits the city’s 8.5 million residents.When asked what he would say to Trump, Mamdani responded, “I’m here to work for the benefit of everyone that calls this city home, and wherever there is a possibility for working together towards that end, I’m ready, and if it’s to the expense of those New Yorkers, I will fight it.”In an earlier interview, he said the relationship with the White House would be “critical to the success of the city” and that he planned to be “proactive” as he prepares to take office on 1 January.The meeting will take place at a tense moment for New York City. According to NYT, city leaders have been preparing for possible clashes with the federal government after the president threatened to send National Guard troops and explored using a Staten Island Coast Guard facility to detain immigrants.Trump has also withheld billions in federal aid and suggested he could pull more.As the two prepare to meet, Mamdani has maintained that while he is ready to cooperate where possible, he will oppose any action that harms New Yorkers. As quoted by The Guardian, he said recently, “I’m here to work for the benefit of everyone that calls this city home… and if it’s to the expense of those New Yorkers, I will fight it.”","President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that New York City’s mayor-elect, Zohran ‘Kwame’ Mamdani, will meet him at the Oval Office on Friday, 21 November.

Historic 427-1 Vote: Bill To Expose Epstein Files Passes In House; Who Said What, Senate Test Next

What are Epstein Files?





US President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced that he has signed the Epstein Files Transparency Act. The bill directs the Justice Department to publicly release all files related to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.The legislation passed the US House of Representatives on Tuesday by an overwhelming 427–1 vote and was cleared by the Senate on Wednesday morning.In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump wrote: “ I have signed the bill to release the Epstein Files!""The President’s post accused several high-profile Democratic figures including former President Bill Clinton, economist Larry Summers, investor Reid Hoffman and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of having close ties with Epstein. He alleged that the documents could reveal more about those relationships once they are released.""Jeffrey Epstein, who was charged by the Trump Justice Department in 2019 (Not the Democrats!), was a lifelong Democrat, donated Thousands of Dollars to Democrat Politicians, and was deeply associated with many well-known Democrat figures, such as Bill Clinton (who traveled on his plane 26 times), Larry Summers (who just resigned from many Boards, including Harvard), Sleazebag Political Activist Reid Hoffman, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (who asked Epstein to donate to his Campaign after Epstein was charged), Democrat Congresswoman Stacey Plaskett, and many more,"" he further wrote in his post.Trump also claimed credit for the bill’s swift passage through Congress and used the announcement to sharply criticize Democrats, asserting that they were trying to “deflect” from Republican achievements.He also criticised former President Joe Biden alleging that under his tenure, the Justice Department did not release any documents related to Epstein or address his case publicly.""Do not forget — The Biden Administration did not turn over a SINGLE file or page related to Democrat Epstein, nor did they ever even speak about him.,"" he wrote.Trump’s endorsement of the bill marks a reversal of his earlier stance. For months, he had resisted expanding access to the files, calling the matter a “Democrat hoax.” However, he shifted position earlier this week as it became clear the House would pass the legislation, saying Republicans had “nothing to hide”.The “Epstein files” are a large set of documents and evidence collected during investigations into financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. These include flight logs, contact lists, witness statements, correspondence and records of his travel and finances. The files contain the names of several well-known individuals who had social or business links with Epstein.Many of these materials have remained sealed or heavily redacted for years, leading to growing demands for full disclosure. Survivors of Epstein’s abuse, along with lawmakers, have urged authorities to release the files, saying transparency is crucial after repeated failures by federal agencies.Under the newly signed bill, the Attorney General must release unclassified Epstein-related records within 30 days, with redactions only to protect victims’ identities, sensitive content and ongoing investigations, as reported by the Guardian.The House Oversight Committee has already made public tens of thousands of pages that highlight Epstein’s network of political, financial and global connections. His ties also extended to the United Kingdom, where Prince Andrew was stripped of royal titles amid public pressure.Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein were once socially acquainted and photographed together in the early 2000s. Trump has stated he ended contact with Epstein long before his 2008 conviction and has denied any wrongdoing, even as earlier email releases showed Epstein referencing Trump in private communications.",US President Donald Trump has signed the Epstein Files Transparency Act.

Senator Bernie Sanders said Trump hates Muslims, except the rich ones.Sanders posted on X: “Trump dislikes Muslims, except those who are billionaire autocrats who can make his family even richer.”The visit was the first by the Saudi ruler to the United States since the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. It featured one of the most lavish welcomes of Trump’s presidency. The POTUS greeted bin Salman with a military flyover, cannon fire, a horse parade, and a gala on the South Lawn.The reception became tense in the Oval Office during a moment when a reporter questioned Trump about the family’s business interests in Saudi Arabia and the crown prince’s alleged role in Khashoggi’s murder. Trump snapped and called the reporter ""worst"": “You don’t have to embarrass our guest. One of the worst in the business. I have devoted 100% of my energy. My family has done very little with Saudi Arabia. He’s (Prince) done a phenomenal job… He knew nothing about [Khashoggi].Bin Salman addressed the allegations and called the killing “painful” and “a huge mistake.” He asserted that Saudi authorities had improved investigative systems to prevent future incidents. He also described the deaths of 9/11 victims as “painful” and argued critics were aiding Osama bin Laden’s purpose.Trump went further in his praise of the crown prince, calling his work “incredible — in human rights and in other areas,” despite US intelligence reports implicating him in Khashoggi’s murder. Alongside the Oval Office meetings, a state dinner hosted by first lady Melania Trump and upcoming announcements on defence and commercial agreements, including F-35 fighter jets and AI infrastructure investments.","US President Donald Trump welcomed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

‘Desperate’ For Saudi-Israel Ties, Trump 'IGNORES' Pentagon's China Threat; Okays 48 F-35 Jets Deal





US President Donald Trump said on Monday that his administration would move ahead with the long-anticipated sale of F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia, despite internal concerns that the deal could expose sensitive American technology to China.When asked whether he would approve the sale, Trump said, “I will say that we will be doing that. We’ll be selling F-35s.”The announcement came a day before Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s expected arrival in Washington, his first US visit in over seven years. The F-35 deal is among several major agreements the two countries are likely to unveil during the visit, according to AP.The crown prince is expected to seek formal US assurances on military protection for the kingdom and the purchase of the F-35, one of the world’s most advanced fighter jets.The timing of the announcement also reflects Trump’s push to secure a normalisation deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel. He has promoted an expansion of the Abraham Accords as key to long-term regional stability while the fragile Gaza ceasefire holds. “I hope that Saudi Arabia will be going into the Abraham Accords very shortly,” he told reporters on Air Force One on Friday.However, Saudi Arabia has maintained that any deal must include a guaranteed pathway to a Palestinian state, a position Israel firmly rejects.Officials say Riyadh is unlikely to join the accords immediately, though there is guarded optimism about a possible agreement by the end of Trump’s second term.The New York Times reported that a Pentagon intelligence assessment raised fresh concerns that China could gain access to sensitive F-35 technology if the sale proceeds. Sources familiar with the Defence Intelligence Agency’s findings said US officials fear potential Chinese espionage and Beijing’s growing security cooperation with Riyadh. Washington has also been evaluating whether the sale would affect Israel’s qualitative military edge, given Israel is the only Middle Eastern country operating F-35s and has used them in strikes in Iran in October 2024 and June 2025.Bradley Bowman of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies said Congress may now seek clarity on what assurances Riyadh has offered regarding its ties with China. He added that lawmakers are likely to press the administration on how it plans to maintain Israel’s military advantage in the region.",US President Donald Trump said on Monday that his administration would move ahead with the long-anticipated sale of F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia.

Trump 'knew about the underage girls'?











Mark Epstein, the brother of the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein , has tried to shut down a viral rumour about the newly released Epstein emails. He said that the name “Bubba” mentioned in a 2018 exchange between the brothers was not a reference to former President Bill Clinton.The clarification came after a March 2018 email between Jeffrey and Mark Epstein was released this week by Democrats, which stirred a row. In the message, Mark asked Jeffrey, who had said he was with Steve Bannon, to “ask him if Putin has the photos of Trump b*****g Bubba.” Because Clinton was long known by the nickname “Bubba”, the reference was speculated by many as Trump having oral intercourse with Clinton.Mark Epstein pushed back in a statement to The Advocate, saying the message was being misread. “They were simply part of a humorous private exchange between two brothers and were never meant for public release or to be interpreted as serious remarks,” he wrote. He added, “For the avoidance of doubt, the reference to ‘Bubba’ in this correspondence is not, in any way, a reference to former President Bill Clinton.”Mark's spokesperson, Ali Clark, said in an email that Bubba is “a private individual who is not a public figure.”Mark said that attaching political motives to a nickname distracts from “the serious questions that remain unanswered.”The wider set of emails points to far more serious claims about Jeffrey Epstein’s political ties with the MAGA chief. In a 2019 message to author Michael Wolff, Epstein wrote that Trump “knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine to stop.” Another email from 2011, sent to Ghislaine Maxwell, claimed that Trump spent hours at Epstein’s home with one of his sex-trafficking victims.California Representative Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said the documents raise “serious new questions” about Trump’s ties to Epstein and accused the Justice Department of obstructing the inquiry. “There’s a massive cover-up at the White House and the DOJ right now over the files.”The White House has dismissed the emails, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt rejecting any suggestion of Trump being involved in the Epstein scandal.Meanwhile, Trump also claimed that Bill Clinton spent significant time on Epstein’s island and threatened to launch an FBI and DOJ probe into various high-profile figures, including JPMorgan and Chase.The row intensified on Friday when Trump launched a Truth Social rant attacking Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene after she backed a bipartisan move to force the release of all unclassified Epstein files.","Mark Epstein, the brother of the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, has tried to shut down a viral rumour about the newly released Epstein emails.

On Cam: Dem Lawmaker’s ‘Texts’ With Epstein Inside U.S. Cong Sparks Fury; Explosive Plaskett Link





Former Harvard University president and US treasury secretary Larry Summers has said he will step back from several public roles following the release of documents detailing years of personal correspondence with convicted sex offender and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.In a statement issued by him on Monday night, quoted by The Washington Post, Summers said he was “deeply ashamed” of maintaining contact with Epstein and accepted full responsibility for what he called a “misguided” decision. He said he would continue his teaching duties but would retreat from other commitments as part of an effort to rebuild trust and mend ties with people close to him.“I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused,” Summers said. “I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein. While continuing to fulfill my teaching obligations, I will be stepping back from public commitments as one part of my broader effort to rebuild trust and repair relationships with the people closest to me”, he added.His announcement comes in the wake of the House Oversight Committee’s release of a fresh set of documents detailing Epstein’s extensive interactions with political leaders, influential figures and long-time associates.While much public attention focused on Epstein’s comments about Donald Trump, the material also shed light on his communications with Summers.According to a report by The Guardian, emails exchanged between the two from 2013 to early 2019 show Epstein and Summers discussing politics, personal matters and Summers’s own relationships. In several of the exchanges, Epstein offered advice on Summers’s attempts to pursue a woman. The final messages were sent only months before Epstein’s arrest.The Centre for American Progress said Summers was no longer a fellow and confirmed that the planned launch of an economic working group he was to help lead had been put on hold as Summers continued to remain under public scrutiny. The Yale Budget Lab said he had withdrawn from its advisory group. Other organisations with which he is affiliated, including economic think tanks, did not immediately issue public comments.Summers, who served as Harvard University president from 2001 to 2006 and continues as a professor, faced renewed calls for the university to distance itself. Senator Elizabeth Warren, herself an emerita Harvard professor, told CNN that the institution should sever ties. Harvard did not respond to requests for comment.Epstein donated more than $9 million to Harvard and its affiliated programmes between 1998 and 2008 and briefly held a visiting fellowship that the university later found he was unqualified for.Summers has previously acknowledged regretting his dealings with Epstein. The release of the latest documents has revived scrutiny over the depth and duration of their relationship.","Larry Summers has said he will step back from several public roles following the release of documents detailing years of personal correspondence with disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.

"Sheikh Hasina sentenced to death, Dhaka reiterates extradition call; India non-committal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/death-penalty-for-hasina-dhaka-wants-her-back/articleshow/125398370.cms,"Ousted Bangladesh PM Hasina Calls ICT’s Death Sentence ‘Rigged’, Says It Denied Fair Trial Rights

.

.





Deposed Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina was Monday sentenced to death in absentia for the violent 2024 student crackdown by a special tribunal in a verdict that she described as a foregone conclusion. Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus hailed the verdict saying no one is above the law.Hasina had called the tribunal a kangaroo court and, as she told ToI before the verdict, one that was controlled by her political adversaries looking to deflect attention from their governance failures.India responded to Hasina’s sentencing with caution as it said in a statement that it had taken note of the verdict by the ""International Crimes Tribunal of Bangladesh” and, as a close neighbour, remained committed to the best interests of the people of Bangladesh, including in peace, democracy, inclusion and stability in that country.“We will always engage constructively with all stakeholders to that end,’’ said the external affairs ministry in a statement, giving nothing away on Dhaka’s renewal of its demand immediately after the sentencing for the extradition of the deposed PM who remains in India.The government has so far only acknowledged the interim government’s call for her extradition, while remaining non-committal on what it proposes to do about it.That has been its position since December last year, when Dhaka officially sought her extradition, and it’s unlikely to comply with any such request in haste now as Hasina’s dramatic death sentencing does little to change the situation on the ground as far as India is concerned.The 2013 extradition treaty with Dhaka in any case may provide immunity to Hasina from any political witch hunt. Article 6 of the treaty states that extradition can be refused if the offence for which it is requested is of a political character. While Dhaka will argue that the same article excludes murder from the list of such offences, Article 8 also states that a person may not be extradited if he can convince the requested state that the accusations against him were not made in good faith “in the interests of justice”.In short, extradition would be a complex and long-drawn-out process and, for India, entail both legal commitments and geopolitical considerations. The sentencing will likely only add another layer of complexity to Hasina’s case. As an aspiring great power, India would not like to be seen as giving up on a longtime ally who remained attuned to India’s economic and security interests, not least by keeping in check radical Islamists. Abandoning Hasina would also not just demoralise Hasina’s party Awami League, which is facing a ban from participating in the upcoming elections, but also energize radical anti-India forces.The unelected interim government has also done little to assuage India’s concerns about increasing radicalisation and safety and security of minority communities. India also knows that Dhaka’s ongoing efforts to revive the relationship with Pakistan can act as real conundrum for India soon, even as it engages the interim government by hosting the Bangladesh NSA for a security conclave this week.More than the fate of Hasina perhaps, India will be concerned about what the verdict might mean for Awami League as it seeks free, fair and inclusive polls in the country. Hasina told ToI last week that the ban came from an unelected cadre that seized power and now wanted to take its political opponents out of the game.“It was the Awami League that introduced key reforms to ensure transparency and fairness, including- the use of photo-based voter lists, see-through ballot boxes, and the establishment of an independent election commission. There is an irony that the only party which ensured free elections is now barred from participating,” she said. For India too, it’s imperative that Awami League be allowed to contest elections that are genuinely fair and inclusive.","Deposed Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina was Monday sentenced to death in absentia for the violent 2024 student crackdown.

It's also funny that out of all the people that Trump sued for lying he didn't sue Elon

Sometimes you gotta fold for the greater good. Musk trying to close contracts and expand into Saudi Arabia with Starlink. These aren’t our conversations.

Don’t like Elon at all - but him and everyone else are there bc we live in a corrupt a** country where trump rewards those who kiss the ring and punishes those who don’t.

Well, Musk is in the files too. And when he isn't crashing out on ketamine, he remembers that and decides working with the admin for protection is his best play.

He has a bad habit of 'pedo' accusations against someone he's mad at.

Brown nosing to get his name redacted too.





A row erupted after Elon Musk attended a White House dinner with US President Donald Trump, months after publicly accusing him of being named in the Jeffrey Epstein files.The controversy began when Musk posted a message on X in June claiming that Trump appeared in the Epstein documents and that this was the real reason the files had not yet been released. He even told followers to “mark this post for the future.” Within hours, Musk deleted the message without explanation. Netizens questioned whether the billionaire was backing away from his claim or had received legal advice.The White House had earlier described Musk’s comments as “unfortunate,” noting that the president had already indicated he would sign legislation requiring the Justice Department to release all unclassified records related to Epstein and his associates.Musk’s appearance at the White House dinner has therefore struck many as contradictory. The event was held in honour of visiting dignitaries and attended by business leaders. It saw Musk seated alongside senior officials and industry figures.Social media users were quick to point out the irony of the world’s richest man sharing a table with Trump shortly after effectively accusing him of hiding evidence.The two men have had an increasingly tense public relationship.The MAGA chief and the Tesla CEO were once viewed as occasional allies, but that has deteriorated amid policy disagreements, clashes over spending priorities, and Musk’s criticism of certain White House decisions. Trump, for his part, has grown irritated with Musk’s unpredictability and willingness to provoke.The ex-DOGE lead was named in the Epstein files in September, according to the BBC. Musk has denied claims that he ever visited Epstein’s private island, arguing that the allegations were part of a smear campaign.

On Cam: Trump SNAPS At Female Reporter, Calls Her ‘PIGGY’ For Asking Question On Epstein Files





: Growing tensions between the Trump White House and the largely liberal Washington press corps reached a flashpoint this week after the MAGA boss directed a crude insult toward a female journalist and threatened to revoke the license of a broadcast network whose reporter asked him tough questions.The first episode unfolded on November 14 on Air Force One when Bloomberg reporter Catherine Lucey, traveling with the President, pressed him on the release of the Epstein files. A clearly irked Trump raised his index finger and snapped: “Quiet! Quiet, piggy!” – a slur that reverberated across the media world.In a subsequent episode at the White House on Tuesday, Trump unloaded on ABC reporter Mary Bruce, who bluntly questioned him about the appropriateness of his family doing business in Saudi Arabia while he is President, and then directed a question to the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman regarding the U.S. intelligence conclusion that he orchestrated the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.A furious Trump told her not to ""embarrass our guest by asking a question like that,"" as he erupted at her network ABC, calling it ""fake news"" and ""one of the worst in the business.""When an unflustered Bruce followed up by asking why he should be waiting for Congress to release the Epstein files when he could do it himself, Trump lost his cool, complaining about her “attitude, and calling her a “terrible reporter.”He then wondered if the license of the Bruce’s network ABC should be taken away because “your news is so fake,” going so far as to suggest he would ask the FCC chair to look into it.The latest confrontations and insults fit squarely within Trump’s well-documented playbook of using epithets and bullying to control and dominate media interactions, particularly where it involves women. Since his entry into national politics, he has systematically deployed gendered slurs to undermine female crtiics who challenge his narratives, going back to the ""Nasty Woman"" epithet he deployed against Hillary Clinton during a 2016 debate, calling Senator Elizabeth Warren “Pocohontos,” followed by “cackling Kamala” against Kamala Harris.Journalists like Megyn Kelly, Mika Brzezinski, and April Ryan have all been subjected to highly personal, often appearance-based, or vaguely sexualized slurs from the President, demonstrating a consistent tactical choice: when confronted by a woman asking an inconvenient question, pivot immediately to personal humiliation and denigration to deflect from the subject.Although the White House Correspondents’ Association has affirmed the necessity of asking tough questions and condemned the use of ""demeaning and unprofessional language,” most White House reporters, no angels by any account, swallow the slights to remain on the beat and maintain access in a job that has become increasingly challenging.The White House on its part has tried to overcome the liberal mainstream media’s tough posture with a makeover of the press corps, drafting several MAGA influencers whose softball questions and sycophancy would be the envy of the North Korean leader.Since his entry into national politics, Trump has manufactured hundreds of disparaging monikers for his opponents, including men. His political rogues’ gallery includes “Lyin’ Ted Cruz,” “Liddle’ Marco Rubio,” “Pencil Neck Adam Schiff,” and, “Crooked Joe Biden.” More recently critics have tried to respond likewise, for instance, calling him ""Cheeto"" ""Felonious Trump"" and “Dozing Donald” after he was seen napping during a White House event. But none of the nicknames have stuck to Teflon Don.","The President snapped at a female reporter who asked him tough questions about the release of the Epstein files.

Ro Khanna: What is his net worth?









On Tuesday, the US Congress unanimously voted to force the release of Justice Department files on the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein . The House of Representatives passed the measure with a vote of 427-1 sending a resolution requiring the release of all unclassified records on Epstein to the Senate, which approved it. Now, the bill is on the way to Trump's desk, waiting for the final approval.The release of the Epstein files has been one of the most trending topics in the American political arena for the past couple of years. Thus, the passing of the vote has created many headlines. Raising his hand and voice among the crowd of congressmen who voted for the release of the files is Rep. Ro Khanna According to him, Tuesday's triumph proves that he should be taken seriously as a party leader and maybe even considered for the 2028 presidential election. He shared with CNN, that the vote vindicates the value of his long relationship with Republicans and his willingness to talk to almost any party.But before his candidacy for the presidency can be considered, here are some details about him that you must know.Rohit Khanna, 45, is an Indian-origin American politician and attorney who is the representative of California's 17th District in the 117th Congress.

He is also an author with two published books, 'Entrepreneurial Nation: Why Manufacturing is Still Key to America’s Future' and 'Dignity in a Digital Age'.Ro Khanna was born in September 1976 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Indian immigrant parents from a Punjabi Hindu family. His father is a chemical engineer while his mother is a former schoolteacher. His maternal grandfather, Amarnath Vidyalankar, was from Bhera city in the Shahpur District of Punjab province, British India.

Political Quake On Capitol Hill As Cong Okays Bill To Release Epstein Files; Big Defeat For Trump?





Donald Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, stepped into the debate over the impending release of Jeffrey Epstein files, claiming that newly public emails show the convicted pedophile had no love for his father.Posting on X, Jr said: “It’s clear from all the emails that Jeffrey Epstein hated Trump… so much so that he literally was literally live texting Democrats on how to impeach him. If he had anything on Trump he would have used it! But, why was a convicted pedophile still in direct coms with dems???”His comments come as Congress moved to force the public release of all unclassified records relating to Epstein and his right-hand woman Ghislaine Maxwell . The House passed the bill in a 427-1 vote, with only Republican Clay Higgins opposing it. The Senate approved the measure after a unanimous consent agreement cleared the way.The legislation now heads to President Donald Trump’s desk. Despite days of denying it, he has said he will sign it. A senior White House official said the president plans to review the bill as soon as it arrives. Once signed, the Justice Department will have 30 days to release the documents, with redactions to protect victims.Trump had resisted the push for disclosure for months calling it a ""hoax"" but abruptly changed course on Sunday, urging his MAGA base and Republicans to support the bill. Even after backing it, he has complained about the continued focus on Epstein, calling it a trivial matter pushed by Democrats to overshadow his administration.","Donald Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, claims newly public emails show the convicted pedophile had no love for his father.

(With inputs from agencies)





Pakistan’s judiciary is in a moment of crisis as senior judges resign amid a contentious constitutional amendment reshapes the balance of power in favour of the military. Behind the crisis is the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment, a sweeping package pushed through parliament within days. Lawyers, judges and opposition parties argue that it has weakened the courts and elevated the military’s top commander to a position with no modern parallel.Since then, Pakistan’s judiciary has been hit by a series of high-profile resignations. On Saturday, Lahore High Court judge Shams Mehmood Mirza stepped down, and his family said his decision was directly linked to the 27th Amendment. His departure followed those of Supreme Court justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah, who issued sharply worded letters condemning the amendment as a direct attack on judicial independence.The creation of a new Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) lies at the heart of judicial restructuring. The FCC now holds exclusive jurisdiction over constitutional matters, stripping the Supreme Court of its original powers. Pending petitions have already been shifted to the new court. President Zardari swore in Justice Aminuddin Khan as its first chief justice; six other judges were appointed, including serving Supreme Court and high court judges, though one judge reportedly refused to join.The FCC’s establishment has sparked intense concern. Critics say the president’s new power to transfer judges risks becoming a tool to sideline dissenting voices. Opposition groups argue this will fundamentally weaken judicial independence and concentrate constitutional authority in the executive and military leadership.Government ministers, however, hailed the package as “historic” and a step toward greater efficiency and national unity. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the amendment proved that “solidarity” prevailed during a time of national strain.With judges resigning, courts being reconfigured, and the military gaining unprecedented constitutional control, Pakistan faces a moment of reckoning.The amendment passed with overwhelming numbers in both houses has dramatically restructured Pakistan’s defence architecture, elevating army chief Asim Munir to Chief of Defence Forces with command over all three military branches. His five-year tenure now resets from the date of notification, enabling him to remain in office until 2030.The Senate has since rushed through four related bills, including amendments to the Army, Air Force and Navy Acts, along with changes to Supreme Court practice rules. These laws remove the earlier equality among service chiefs and replace references to the Joint Chiefs of Staff system with a new “National Strategic Command”, further centralising military authority under Munir.Dawn reported that appointments, extensions, and tenures under these reforms “shall not be called into question before any court on any ground whatsoever”.Experts quoted in multiple reports warn that the shift risks internal military tensions and further erodes civilian oversight. Lawyer Osama Malik described the reforms as something “usually granted in absolute monarchies”, arguing they grant lifetime protections not only to Munir but also to President Zardari.Opposition lawmakers responded with uproar, shredding copies of the bill and walking out. PTI leaders labelled the move “deeply undemocratic” and “the final nail in the coffin of an independent judiciary”. Critics say these changes could reshape the political landscape, particularly for nearly 200 cases involving former prime minister Imran Khan.","Pakistan's judiciary is in a moment of crisis as senior judges resign amid a contentious constitutional amendment. The amendment reshapes the balance of power in favour of the military. Lawyers, judges and opposition parties argue that it has weakened the courts and elevated the military’s top commander.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125346032,imgsize-697824,width-400,resizemode-4/asim-munir-file-photo.jpg"

Military reforms: Asim Munir at the helm



Judicial restructuring: Federal constitutional court



Political reactions



What next







Pakistan’s National Assembly on Wednesday passed the 27th constitutional amendment bill, granting sweeping powers to the military in general and country’s army chief Asim Munir in specific, and restructuring the judiciary.The vote, held amid a ruckus in the lower house, saw 234 lawmakers in favour and only four against, speaker Ayaz Sadiq announced. The session was attended by top political leaders, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, PML-N President Nawaz Sharif, and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.The amendment comes at a time of heightened political tension in Pakistan, with the ruling coalition seeking to consolidate control over key defence and judicial institutions. The legislation follows earlier Senate approval, where it received 64 votes in favour and no opposition, as the opposition benches boycotted proceedings.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed the passage as a demonstration of national unity, saying the house exhibited solidarity. He also condemned a recent terrorist incident in Wana, drawing parallels to the Army Public School massacre, and praised law enforcement for securing the safety of students and cadets.The amendment elevates Pakistan army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir to the newly created role of Chief of Defence Forces, giving him constitutional authority over all three branches: army, navy, and air force. Honorary five-star ranks such as field marshal, marshal of the air force, and admiral of the fleet remain lifetime titles. According to the country's law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, the reform “aims to bring constitutional oversight to defence appointments while preserving military honour and tradition.The bill also establishes a federal constitutional court (FCC) to handle constitutional and provincial matters, leaving the Supreme Court to focus on civil and criminal cases. The FCC will have equal representation from all provinces and the power to take suo motu notices on constitutional petitions. The Judicial Commission will oversee judge transfers; refusal of a transfer will be treated as retirement.The ruling coalition, including PML-N, PPP, MQM-P, and allies, backed the amendment. Opposition lawmakers condemned it as unconstitutional. PTI chairman Gohar Ali Khan called it the “Baku Amendments” and accused the government of undermining democracy. Mehmood Khan Achakzai of PkMAP protested by tearing a copy of the bill in the house.The amendment now returns to the Senate for final approval before becoming law. Analysts say the 27th amendment significantly strengthens Munir’s role in Pakistan’s military hierarchy while altering judicial oversight, marking a shift in Pakistan’s institutional framework.(With input from agencies, Dawn)","The amendment elevates Pakistan army chief Asim Munir to the newly created role of Chief of Defence Forces.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment

Why it matters

The big picture

The Field Marshal’s expanding power evokes a hybrid of Pakistan’s two most dominant military rulers:

Ayub Khan, who introduced centralized presidential control and laid the foundations for military-led governance.

Zia-ul-Haq, who used the Army and Islamization to seize power, marginalize the judiciary, and suppress civilian opposition.

Munir is consolidating power not through martial law, but via constitutional amendments passed by a pliant parliament.

If Zia’s coup was loud and brutal against a strong popular leadership, Munir’s is silent, yet possibly more far reaching, being done through a political front office that’s pliant and dependent on the Army for authority. With Imran Khan in prison, any opposition will come from the streets and the troubled insurgencies to the west of Islamabad.

Pranab Dhal Samanta in the Economic Times

Zoom in

The transformation follows the India-Pakistan conflict in May 2025, a four-day exchange of air and missile strikes after the Pahalgam terror attack.

India’s Operation Sindoor targeted Pakistani airbases, radars, and command centers.

Pakistan requested a ceasefire after intense damage - a request reportedly initiated by Pakistan’s DGMO.

Donald Trump, who claimed to have brokered the truce(India has repeatedly denied the US President's claims), was effusively thanked by Munir and PM Shehbaz Sharif. Trump now calls Munir his “favorite field marshal.”

The Financial Times described their dynamic as a “bromance,” with Trump showcased on billboards across Pakistan alongside Munir and Sharif.

This international validation was followed by Munir’s promotion to Field Marshal, the second such promotion in Pakistan’s history - and the first codified under the Constitution.

Between the lines

This isn’t just about military command - it’s about rewriting the DNA of the Pakistani state.

The amendment creates a new Federal Constitutional Court, potentially diluting the powers of the Supreme Court and creating ambiguity about the hierarchy of judicial authority.

President Zardari is also granted lifelong immunity in the amendment, mirroring the legal shield given to Munir.

This dual protection signals a strategic alliance between the military and top civilian figures to institutionalize mutual insulation from accountability.

“Too much has been left to ad hoc and arbitrary decisions,” Mazari warned.

The domestic question: Can repression deliver reform?

The three-front storm: Taliban, TTP, and India

“If you nurture snakes in your backyard, they will bite you,” said Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the Pakistani military’s official spokesman, referencing the Taliban. What a comeuppance : The remark could just as well apply to all Pakistan-grown terror groups and the TTP, whose resurgence is a grim case of blowback.

The bottom line





In Pakistan, where generals have often ruled with impunity and influence, Field Marshal Asim Munir is scripting a new playbook-quiet, precise, and constitutionally sealed. His rise is not just another chapter in the country’s well-worn saga of military dominance. It is, as one senior opposition leader put it, “a rewrite of the entire power manual.”Pakistan’s controversial 27th Constitutional Amendment proposes to recast the country’s military command structure by abolishing the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) and creating the role of Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) - a position that will be held by the Army Chief, currently Field Marshal Asim Munir •The amendment vests unprecedented legal and constitutional power in the CDF, giving Munir operational and institutional control over the army, navy, and air force, as well as the country’s nuclear command.•It also grants five-star officers life-long rank, privileges, and immunity, a move seen as creating a parallel unelected authority beyond the reach of civilian or judicial oversight.“This amendment appears tailored to benefit a specific individual rather than to strengthen the defence structure,” Lt Gen Asif Yasin Malik, former defence secretary, told Dawn.The CJCSC post - created after the 1971 war to ensure coordination among services - will be dissolved on November 27, 2025, when the current chairman, Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza, retires.The 27th Amendment represents the largest shift in Pakistan’s civil-military balance since the Zia era, codifying the military’s supremacy in a way that future civilian governments may struggle to reverse.•The military will no longer merely influence governance from behind the scenes - it will be constitutionally entrenched at the center of executive authority.•Strategic nuclear assets, previously overseen by the National Command Authority, will now fall under the commander of national strategic command, appointed by the PM on the army chief’s advice, and selected from within the army.“All nuclear weapons and delivery systems will be under army control, including second-strike missiles traditionally under the Navy,” warned Dr Shireen Mazari, former human rights minister, a Dawn report said.•The change grants the army a monopoly over promotions, transfers, and postings across the services, threatening morale and inter-service harmony.“If promotions in the Air Force and Navy are determined by an army-origin CDF, it could lead to festering resentments,” Mazari cautioned.At home, Munir is both omnipresent and embattled. According to a Financial Times report, his supporters compare him to Mohammed bin Salman or South Korea’s General Park - ruthless modernisers willing to bulldoze institutions in the name of reform. His critics, however, see echoes of Zia-ul-Haq’s theocratic militarism cloaked in constitutional legitimacy.The judiciary is already split, thanks to a proposed constitutional court that would dilute the Supreme Court’s power. Journalists are censored, civil rights groups are muzzled, and political opponents - most notably former Prime Minister Imran Khan - are jailed or silenced.And yet, Munir has cast himself as the architect of reform. In his speech at the Pakistan Military Academy, he spoke of “treasures hidden beneath our land” and claimed that Pakistan had begun to “regain its rightful place in the comity of nations.”But the economy tells another story. As per the FT report, Pakistan’s investment rate is the lowest in South Asia, its poverty rate has risen to 25%, and its youth unemployment is dangerously high. The country remains dependent on IMF bailouts and Gulf financing that has yet to materialise in promised volumes.While Munir consolidates power at home, Pakistan finds itself encircled by a resurgent triangle of threats - each historically rooted, each dangerously revived. In the west, the Afghan Taliban’s return to power in 2021 has proved more liability than leverage. Once covertly supported by Pakistan’s security establishment, the Taliban now resist Islamabad’s demands and turn a blind eye to cross-border attacks on Pakistani soil.More ominously, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an offshoot long declared outlawed, has regrouped in Afghanistan and resumed attacks in Pakistan’s tribal belt and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. This year alone, militant violence has killed over 1,400 people - the highest toll in a decade.“The military simply lacks political support on the ground there,” Iftikhar Firdous, founder of The Khorasan Diary, told FT. “The crackdown has alienated entire communities.”Simultaneously, Pakistan’s eastern border with India remains fragile after the four-day air conflict in May.Add to that domestic insurgencies in Balochistan and the Pashtun belt, and Pakistan now faces not one, but three overlapping security fronts. Instead of acting as a force-multiplier, the military’s expanding political and economic footprint is beginning to stretch its operational capacity thin.The 27th Amendment enshrines military supremacy in Pakistan's Constitution under the guise of reform and modernization.•It moves the country further away from parliamentary democracy, and deeper into military-led constitutional authoritarianism.•As Field Marshal Asim Munir prepares to become the first Chief of Defence Forces, Pakistan’s most consequential question remains: Can a military man fix a failing nation - or will history repeat itself?(With inputs from agencies)","Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment.

ISLAMABAD: A suicide bomber killed 12 people outside a court in Islamabad on Tuesday in a sharp escalation of militant violence that the defence minister said had pushed the country into a ""state of war"".Pakistani govt ministers accused neighbouring Afghanistan of complicity in the bloodshed - an accusation Kabul denied - and vowed retaliation if Afghan authorities failed to rein in the militants Islamabad says were responsible. ""We are in a state of war,"" said defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif after the attack, the first strike on civilians in Islamabad in a decade. ""Bringing this war to Islamabad is a message from Kabul, to which Pakistan has the full power to respond. ""The bombing outside an Islamabad court also wounded 27 people interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said. The court bomber blew himself up near the entrance at around lunchtime. Images on local media showed people covered in blood lying next to a police van. A vehicle was seen on fire and another car was badly damaged. Police cordoned off the site. Naqvi said the bomber had tried to enter the court building on foot but, unable to find a way in, detonated the device outside, close to a police vehicle.Several of the wounded were in critical condition, a hospital source said.No group claimed responsibility for Tuesday's attack. The main Pakistani militant group, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), denied involvement in the attacks. But a group affiliated with the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, according to The Khorasan Diary, a digital platform in Islamabad that monitors militant activity in the region.TTP militants have in recent years focused attacks on security forces. Civilians had not been hit in Islamabad for a decade, according to Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, a group that tracks attacks.Islamabad says that the Pakistani Taliban and other militants are based in Afghanistan, with the support of India. ""We are totally clear that Afghanistan has to stop them. In case of a failure, we have no option but to take care of those terrorists who are attacking our country,"" Naqvi said, speaking at the scene of the court bombing. The Taliban administration spokesperson in Kabul did not respond to a request for comment on Pakistan's accusations.The court attack happened hours after militants stormed a school near the Afghan border on Monday. The attack on the school in Wana, in the north west, began Monday, when a suicide vehicle rammed the main entrance, killing three people, Naqvi said. Militants then entered the school, which is run by the military but educates civilians.By Tuesday evening, three militants were still inside the compound, security officials said, with rescue operations under way for the students trapped in another part of the school. Naqvi said that the school assailants were in contact with their handlers in Afghanistan during the attack.Reuters","A suicide bomber killed 12 people outside a court in Islamabad on Tuesday in a sharp escalation of militant violence.

Surge in militant violence and worsening ties with Afghanistan







Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif said the country was “in a state of war” after a suicide bomber struck outside the Islamabad district courts on Tuesday, killing at least 12 people and injuring 27.The blast one of the deadliest to hit the capital in recent years has intensified tensions with Afghanistan, with Asif accusing the Taliban government in Kabul of allowing militants to operate freely.In a post on X, Asif said: “Anyone who thinks that the Pakistan army is fighting this war in the Afghan-Pakistan border region and the remote areas of Balochistan should take today’s suicide attack at the Islamabad district courts as a wake-up call: This is a war for all of Pakistan.”He wrote that Pakistan’s military was making “daily sacrifices while providing citizens with a sense of protection and security”, but warned that hoping for negotiations with Kabul would be a “mistake”. Asif insisted that Afghanistan “has the ability to prevent terrorist attacks inside Pakistan” and that bringing the conflict to the capital was “a message from Kabul”.He added that Pakistan “has the strength to respond fully”, saying the attack had erased any remaining doubts about the threat posed by militants operating from Afghan soil.The explosion took place around midday in Islamabad’s G-11 district, just outside the judicial complex where hundreds of lawyers and visitors were present. Police said the attacker tried to enter the court premises but failed, eventually detonating explosives next to a police vehicle, igniting cars and sending a fireball through the street.Interior minister Mohsin Naqvi confirmed that 12 people were killed and 27 wounded. He said authorities had recovered a severed head believed to be that of the attacker, and CCTV footage captured him moments before the blast. Witnesses described scenes of chaos, with people screaming for help as ambulances rushed to the site.The blast comes amid a sharp rise in militant violence across Pakistan. Security officials say the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has carried out hundreds of attacks this year, mostly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa near the Afghan border, but strikes in major cities have been rare. Islamabad was last hit by a suicide attack three years ago.On Monday night, militants also attempted to storm an army-run college in Wana, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Security forces killed two attackers quickly, while others were cornered inside an administrative building. Students and staff were evacuated, and the military said the assault resembled the TTP’s 2014 massacre in Peshawar that killed 154 people.Pakistan says the Afghan Taliban have allowed TTP fighters to take refuge across the border.

Deadlock Deepens: Afghanistan Calls Pakistan Irresponsible As Peace Talks Break Down Once Again





ISLAMABAD: Pakistan said on Sunday that it was committed to dialogue to resolve differences with the Afghan Taliban but demanded that Kabul must address concerns regarding the use of its territory by terrorists.Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Tahir Andrabi issued a statement on different media queries regarding the third round of talks with the Afghan Taliban regime in Istanbul on November 6, which concluded a day later. Turkiye and Qatar mediated the parleys.The peace talks ended without any agreement to tackle the thorny issues of cross-border terrorism , the top officials had said on Saturday.""Pakistan remains committed to the resolution of bilateral differences through dialogue. However, Pakistan's core concern, i.e. terrorism emanating from Afghanistan, needs to be addressed first and foremost,"" the FO said in a statement.It also said that Pakistan's Armed Forces and its people were well determined to eliminate the menace of terrorism from its soil and take action against its supporters, abettors and financiers.In the long statement, the spokesperson said that for the past four years, since the Taliban regime came to power in Afghanistan, there has been a sharp surge in terrorist attacks emanating from Afghan soil.""Throughout these years, Pakistan, despite suffering military and civilian casualties, exercised maximum restraint and did not retaliate,"" it said.Pakistan's expectation was that the Taliban regime would be able to control these attacks and take concrete actions against the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan/Fitna al Khawarij (TTP/FaK) elements present on Afghan soil, the FO said.The Pakistan government last year notified the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as ""Fitna al-Khawarij"", a reference to a group in earlier Islamic history which was involved in violence.Pakistan also tried to positively engage with Afghanistan by offering bilateral trade concessions and humanitarian assistance, and the intention to constructively engage with Afghanistan so as to enable it to become a stable, peaceful and prosperous country that is at peace within and with its neighbours, the statement said.However, despite all these positive gestures, ""the response from the Taliban regime has only been hollow promises and inaction,"" it added.Instead of acting upon the core expectation to stop Afghan territory from being used for attacks against Pakistan, the Taliban regime has always tried to shy away from taking concrete and verifiable actions, it said.""Instead, it has tried to confuse the main issue with other relatively irrelevant and hypothetical issues. By confusing the main issue of terrorism, it keeps trying to develop a narrative which absolves the Taliban regime of its commitments and responsibilities towards the international community and its own people,"" it added.The statement said that Pakistan's October 2025 response to the consistent attacks emanating from Afghanistan was a manifestation of the will and determination that it will not leave any stone unturned to safeguard its territory and its people.The statement added that the Taliban regime was only interested in prolonging the temporary ceasefire, but without taking concrete and verifiable actions against the TTP/FaK terrorists.Pakistan also accused the Afghan Taliban of using the issue of Pakistani terrorists hiding in Afghanistan as a humanitarian issue, adding that they had fled in 2015 to avoid a military operation and fought together with the Afghan Taliban against Nato troops.""These terrorists and their families are now being harboured by the Taliban regime as a payback for their allegiance to the Afghan Taliban,"" it said, and added that the same terrorists established training camps in Afghanistan to launch terrorist activities in Pakistan.The FO rejected the Kabul excuse of lack of control over TTP and demanded definite and concrete actions. Pakistan also rejected the portrayal of TTP as refugees and asked Kabul to hand them over to Pakistan.It said Pakistan has never eschewed dialogue with any Government in Kabul, but it would not hold dialogue with any terrorist group.",Pakistan says it is committed to dialogue to resolve differences with the Afghan Taliban.

Divided legal opinions



Support for reforms







Pakistan’s government has introduced a major constitutional change that has sparked widespread debate and protests across the country. The proposed 27th constitutional amendment, which will be voted on in Parliament next week, seeks to restructure the military’s chain of command and overhaul the judiciary, prompting strong criticism from the Opposition.The current move mirrors the era of General Zia-ul-Haq, Pakistan’s longest-serving de facto head of state, who introduced sweeping constitutional changes to entrench military control under a civilian façade. The proposed 27th Amendment, risks reviving that legacy by placing the armed forces once again at the centre of Pakistan’s political structure.The bill, tabled in the Senate on Saturday after cabinet approval, proposes to abolish the post of chairman joint chiefs of staff committee (CJCSC) and replace it with a new and more powerful position -- chief of defence forces (CDF).According to reports in Dawn, the post will be held by the serving chief of army staff, who will also become the constitutional head of the army, navy and air force. This change would make General Asim Munir the most powerful military officer in Pakistan’s history, formalising his recent promotion to Field Marshal.The amendment also includes plans to set up a new federal constitutional court (FCC) and change how high court judges are appointed.It seeks to transfer some powers from the Supreme Court to the new court, while also granting the president lifelong immunity from criminal prosecution.Pakistan law minister Azam Nazir Tarar presented the bill in the senate, where chairman Yusuf Raza Gilani referred it to a committee led by Farooq Naek for review. Naek said the goal was to “create consensus among members” before the bill comes up for voting on Monday. The government is confident of securing a two-thirds majority in both the senate and the national assembly.Opposition parties have strongly opposed the amendment, calling it a direct threat to Pakistan’s Constitution. A coalition of opposition groups, the Tehreek-e-Tahafuz Ayeen-e-Pakistan (TTAP), which includes Imran Khan’s PTI, Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen (MWM), Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) and the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) has announced nationwide protests starting Sunday.“Democratic institutions have been paralysed within Pakistan… the nation must step up against the [proposed] 27th Amendment,” MWM chief Allama Raja Nasir Abbas said.PkMAP leader Mahmood Khan Achakzai said the protests would begin with the slogan: “Long live democracy, down with dictatorship.” He warned, “The opposition alliance had no choice but to launch a protest movement following the government’s move, which is shaking the foundations of the Constitution.”Legal experts are split on the amendment’s impact. Critics say it would reduce the powers of the Supreme Court, making it “irrelevant,” and tighten executive control over the judiciary.One senior counsel told Dawn, “Left with a limited jurisdiction of deciding ordinary civil, criminal and statutory appeals, the Supreme Court has now become all the more a ‘Supreme District Court’.”Former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar warned that the changes would “empower [the new] Federal Constitutional Court by disempowering the Supreme Court.” He said the amendment also gives the Chief of the Defence Forces constitutional authority for life, formally recognising the Field Marshal rank.Another lawyer pointed out that under the new Article 175A, the chief justice of the FCC would outrank the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and serve until the age of 68 -- three years longer than the current limit of 65.Some legal experts, however, have welcomed the changes. Senior counsel Hafiz Ahsaan Ahmad Khokhar called the 27th Amendment “a major and long-awaited structural shift” in Pakistan’s justice system.He said the plan to have two separate apex courts -- one for appeals (Supreme Court) and one for constitutional cases (FCC) -- would bring “greater clarity, efficiency and constitutional coherence.”He also argued that the reforms could reduce political influence in the judiciary, cut down case backlogs, and modernise the justice system.Khokhar added that the new defence structure under Article 243 was in line with “modern constitutional democracies,” ensuring that the armed forces would operate under a single advisory framework accountable to the prime minister, defence minister and National Security Committee.Newly elected Supreme Court Bar Association in Pakistan, President Haroonur Rasheed also supported the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court, saying it could help streamline the judicial process.","Proposed 27th constitutional amendment will be voted on in Parliament next week.
