2 city cops reunite 104 missing kids with their families in 9 months,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2-city-cops-reunite-104-missing-kids-with-their-families-in-9-months/articleshow/115542085.cms,"NEW DELHI: Head constables Seema Devi and Suman Hooda pulled off a commendable feat in tracing 104 missing children in the last nine months. They travelled to remote areas in Haryana, Bihar and UP to find the children. Their challenges were many, including the families not having recent photographs of the children, language barriers, unfamiliar locations and reticent locals in the places they visited in other states. Despite such impediments, the duo successfully tracked down the children and reunited them with their families.The cops are posted with the anti-human trafficking unit in outer north district. Devi told TOI that the rescues took place between March and Nov under Operation Milap . In some of the remote locales, the major challenge was topography and unfamiliarity with the people and the place. They had to ask for assistance from the local police. ""There were cases when phone numbers that the children had used to contact people were switched off. In such instances, we took the help of the cyber team to determine the last location of the phone,"" she said.Devi recalled a notable case: ""A 13-year-old girl from Bawana went missing. Her youngest brother informed us that she had called him using several phone numbers, claiming she was fine. However, he suspected foul play since she was using different numbers. We investigated the case and tracked her to Jarcha in Noida. There, we found her doing household chores. We rescued her immediately.""In the new places, the women had to win the trust of the locals, which took time, after which they could conduct door-to-door searches. Devi said that outdated photos made it impossible to identify some kids on many occasions. When the families didn't have the latest photographs of their kids, the rescued youngsters, most of them aged 4 to 17 years, had to be physically identified by the parents.Hooda, who joined AHTU in March, said they felt immense pride and relief in being able to reunite children with their families. ""We don't have fixed duty hours. Whenever we receive information about missing kids, we just leave our homes. There are days when I don't see my kids,"" she smiled.Listing some difficulties, she said that it is a challenge to locate missing children in villages that are off the radar. ""We have walked for kilometres because of lack of transportation in such areas. Many people are ready to help us, but there are also those who think assisting police can lead to legal trouble,"" said Hooda.The head constable disclosed how they often obtained crucial clues from beggars and hawkers at railway stations. Showing them photographs of the missing children often elicited information about their sighting. Hooda pointed out how 13- to 17-year-olds were particularly vulnerable to the influence of strangers they met on social media. According to the cops, reasons for children going missing included elopement, drug addiction, lack of parental care, and insufficient education.Devi has two children of her own, aged 16 and 10. ""When I am away for a couple of days, my younger son misses me a lot,"" she said. As a mother, she said it was important for parents to talk to kids and be aware of what they were doing.DCP (outer north) Nidhin Valsan said, ""We are extremely proud of the exceptional work done by Seema and Suman in Operation Milap. Their achievement reinforces our resolve to combat child trafficking and guard our community,"" he said.","Head constables Seema Devi and Suman Hooda travelled to remote areas in Haryana, Bihar and UP to find the children.

BJP’s allegations and protest call

AAP hits back at BJP

A long-standing controversy

NEW DELHI: BJP leaders and workers staged a protest outside AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal 's residence on Feroz Shah Road on Thursday, intensifying their attack over the alleged extravagant renovation of his previous official bungalow, which the party has dubbed a ""Sheesh Mahal.""The BJP has been targeting Kejriwal, questioning the source of funding for the “luxurious” items allegedly installed at the 6 Flagstaff Road bungalow in Civil Lines, which served as the Delhi chief minister's residence until his resignation earlier this year.Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva had announced the protest on Wednesday, accusing Kejriwal of indulging in extravagance while failing to answer pertinent questions regarding the source of funding for high-end furnishings at the property. ""Delhi CM should answer why he decorated the ‘Sheesh Mahal’ with such costly items. This is taxpayers' money, and the people deserve transparency,"" Sachdeva said.Citing an inventory reportedly prepared by the Public Works Department (PWD), BJP leaders alleged a significant disparity between the items provided by the department in 2022 and those left behind when Kejriwal vacated the residence in 2024. The inventory included premium fixtures such as luxurious toilet seats, reclining sofas, costly carpets, and high-end electronic appliances.Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly, Vijender Gupta, also wrote to Lieutenant Governor VK Saxena demanding a high-level investigation into the ""extravagant additions"" to the property. Gupta claimed the PWD had not supplied several items listed in the inventory and questioned their procurement.The Aam Aadmi Party dismissed the allegations as politically motivated and aimed at maligning Kejriwal’s image. “The BJP has unleashed countless investigations against AAP leaders, yet not a single rupee of wrongdoing has been proven. These tactics will not deter us,” AAP said in a statement.The party also pointed out that Kejriwal vacated the official residence after resigning as Delhi chief minister, adhering to all constitutional norms, unlike many politicians who cling to government accommodations.The controversy first erupted earlier this year when documents purportedly prepared by the PWD surfaced, revealing discrepancies in the list of items allocated to the bungalow in 2022 and the inventory taken after Kejriwal vacated it in 2024.BJP leaders have alleged that the cost of the additional items runs into crores and demanded answers on whether funds from the Delhi Jal Board or the controversial excise policy were used.The BJP has repeatedly questioned Kejriwal’s silence on the issue, with Sachdeva terming the alleged extravagance as symbolic of the ""overflowing pot of sins of the Kejriwal government.""",BJP leaders and workers staged a protest outside AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal's residence on Feroz Shah Road.

Political reactions and condemnations

History of sectarian violence in Kurram district

Heavily-armed militants ambushed ambushed dozens of vehicles carrying passengers in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kurram district on Thursday, killing around 50 people, mostly from the minority Shia community. The attack is one of the worst in recent years in Pakistan's volatile northwest, a region frequently plagued by sectarian violence and militant assaults.The convoy was en route from Parachinar to Peshawar when gunmen opened fire. Javed Ullah Mehsud, the deputy commissioner of Kurram, confirmed that 45 people have died in the attack on the convoy, while rescue teams rushed to assist the wounded.Although no group has officially claimed responsibility for the attack, the region is known to be under the influence of the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which has been linked to similar attacks in the area.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) government spokespersons indicated that the convoy, initially reported to have included 200 vehicles, was traveling through areas dominated by militant groups, raising fears of further escalations in an already tense region.Pakistan’s President Asif Ali Zardari strongly condemned the ambush, calling it a ""cowardly and inhumane act"" and urging that those responsible be brought to justice. He also called for immediate medical aid for the injured.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif echoed Zardari’s sentiments, terming the attack a “brutal” assault on innocent citizens. ""The enemies of the peace of the country attacked the convoy of innocent citizens which is tantamount to brutality. All attempts of anti-national elements to destroy the peace of the beloved country will be thwarted,"" he stated, promising to track down the perpetrators.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur also condemned the attack, directing a delegation of provincial officials to visit Kurram district to assess the situation and report back. He has also ordered the establishment of a Provincial Highways Police unit to secure roads in the region.""Targeting innocent civilians is extremely tragic and condemnable. Those involved in this incident will not escape the grip of the law,"" Gandapur added, offering condolences to the victims' families and announcing financial assistance for them.The area has long been a hotspot for sectarian tensions between Shia and Sunni Muslims, primarily stemming from a longstanding land dispute.This volatile region has witnessed multiple sectarian clashes this year. In October, at least 16 people, including women and children, were killed in similar violence. In September, more than 50 people were killed and 120 injured in clashes between Shia and Sunni tribes over land disputes. This violence led to the closure of critical roads and disrupted essential services in the area. Similar clashes in July resulted in dozens of deaths and hundreds of injuries.Kurram district borders Afghanistan’s Khost, Paktia, Logar, and Nangarhar provinces, known as strongholds for groups like ISIS and the Pakistani Taliban, complicating efforts to curb violence in the area.","Militants ambushed dozens of vehicles carrying passengers in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kurram district on Thursday, killing around 50 people.

Israel is not a member state of the court.Despite the warrants, none of the suspects is likely to face judges in The Hague any time soon. The court itself has no police to enforce warrants, instead relying on cooperation from its member states.","International Criminal Court issues arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, former defence minister Yoav Gallant, as well as Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif.

In a sign of major escalation, Russia launched an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) from the Astrakhan region on Thursday morning against Ukraine, marking the first use of a weapon in war.The strike targeted enterprises and critical infrastructure in Dnipro, a central-eastern Ukrainian city. It is unclear whether the missile caused significant damage.Ukraine’s air force stated, “An intercontinental ballistic missile was launched from the Astrakhan region of the Russian Federation.”Security experts said it would be the first military use of an intercontinental ballistic missile, Reuters reported.The statement did not specify the missile type but identified that six Kh-101 cruise missiles were also launched, all of which except one were intercepted by Ukrainian air defences, reported CNN.As per The Telegraph, Russian media reported that Moscow might have used the RS-26 Rubezh missile, capable of carrying both conventional and nuclear warheads and flying at hypersonic speeds, complicating interception efforts.ICBMs typically have a range exceeding 5,500 kilometres and are designed to carry nuclear or conventional warheads.This attack stresses escalating tensions after Ukraine recently used US-made ATACMS and British-French Storm Shadow missiles to strike targets deep within Russian territory, according to Reuters.As the Ukraine made a first move, the Russian defence ministry today said that its air defence systems shot down two British-made Storm Shadow missiles, six HIMARS rockets and 67 drones.The announcement came in the ministry's daily roundup of the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine, AP reported.The European Union said that the attack by Russian President Vladimir Putin marked a ""clear escalation"" in the war.""While we're assessing the full facts it's obvious that such (an) attack would mark yet another clear escalation from the side of Putin,"" EU foreign affairs spokesman Peter Stano told reporters, saying the move would represent a ""quantitative and qualitative change"" in the war, AFP reported.The use of an ICBM follows President Vladimir Putin’s recent update to Russia’s nuclear doctrine. On Tuesday, he announced that Russia would consider aggression from a non-nuclear state, supported by a nuclear power, as a direct threat to its sovereignty.The Kremlin had previously warned that Ukraine’s use of Western long-range missiles would be seen as a major escalation.Ukrainian forces used these advanced weapons to hit Russian military installations earlier this week.Moscow responded with threats of “massive” retaliatory strikes, including the deployment of more advanced missile systems.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov declined to comment on the ICBM deployment. “That’s a question for our military,” he said.","Russia launched an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) from the Astrakhan region on Thursday morning against Ukraine.

It is not yet known what else was discussed on the phone call, apart from the congratulatory message. Musk reportedly listened in as Pichai congratulated and spoke with Trump.This isn’t the first time that reports of a conversation between Trump and Google’s CEO have surfaced online. During his election campaigns, Trump mentioned twice about calling Pichai.In an interview with Bloomberg editor-in-chief John Micklethwait last month, Trump said that he called Google CEO Sundar Pichai to highlight alleged biases in Google search, claiming it only shows negative stories about him. He then said “I called the head of Google the other day and I said, ‘I’m getting a lot of good stories lately, but you don’t find them in Google’,” he said. Pichai, Trump said in the interview, told him that “you’re the No. 1 person on all of Google for stories”.Also read: Donald Trump: I called Google CEO Sundar Pichai the other day and said ...

"ICC arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu, Yoav Gallant & Hamas member",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/icc-issues-arrest-warrants-for-netanyahu-gallant-hamas-member/articleshow/115549419.cms,"Israel PM Netanyahu

THE HAGUE: The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants on Thursday for Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defence chief Yoav Gallant, as well as Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza conflict.In their decision, the judges said there were reasonable grounds to believe Netanyahu and Gallant were criminally responsible for acts including murder, persecution and starvation as a weapon of war as part of a ""widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population of Gaza"". The action came as the death toll from Israel's campaign in Gaza passed 44,000 people, according to local health authorities.The decision was met with outrage in Israel, while Hamas welcomed the warrants.The warrant for Deif, also known as Ibrahim Al-Masri, lists charges of mass killings during the Oct 7, 2023, attacks on Israel, and also charges of rape and the taking of hostages. Israel has said it killed Deif in an airstrike in July but Hamas has neither confirmed nor denied this. The prosecution said it would gather information on his reported death.Israel has rejected the jurisdiction of the Hague-based court and denies war crimes in Gaza. Israel is not a member of the court, so Netanyahu and Gallant, whom the PM recently fired, will not face any risk of arrest at home. But the warrants mean they could be arrested if they travel to one of the court's 124 member nations. That includes most European countries, though not the US. Member countries are required to detain suspects facing a warrant if they set foot on their soil, but the court has no way to enforce that.None of the suspects is likely to face judges in The Hague anytime soon. Still, the warrant marks the first time a sitting leader of a major Western ally has been accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity by a global court of justice. The warrants could contribute to Netanyahu's isolation and complicate efforts to negotiate a ceasefire to end the fighting.Netanyahu's office said the ICC decision was ""anti-semitic"" and he will ""not yield to pressure, will not be deterred"" until Israel's war objectives are met. Gallant said the decision ""sets a dangerous precedent against the right to self-defence and moral warfare and encourages murderous terrorism.""Hamas welcomed the warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant but made no mention of the one against Deif. It urged the court to expand accountability to all Israeli leaders. A senior Hamas official said it was an important step towards bringing justice for the victims.EU's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said the decision was not political but made by a court and thus should be respected and implemented.The White House national security council spokesperson said the US ""fundamentally rejects the court's decision"", adding it remains ""deeply concerned by the prosecutor's rush to seek arrest warrants and the troubling process errors that led to this decision.""","International Criminal Court issues arrest warrants for Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defence chief Yoav Gallant.

Diddy’s public apology

Legal troubles mount for Diddy

Recently leaked text messages between Cassie, the R&B artist and former partner of Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs, have unveiled harrowing details about the 2016 assault and their turbulent relationship. The messages depict a pattern of alleged physical abuse, including an incident that left Cassie with visible injuries.“I have a black eye and fat lip. You always want to show me that you have the power and knock me around,” Cassie wrote in one of the texts, obtained by Enstarz.Further texts detail the chilling aftermath of an assault: “You drag me down the hall by my hair… I have bleeding cuts… You hit me in the head two good times.”“When you get f**ked up the wrong way, you always want to show me that you have the power and you knock me around. I’m not a rag doll. I’m someone’s child,” Cassie said in her texts messages.These messages, paired with surveillance footage from 2016, paint a grim picture of Cassie’s ordeal during her relationship with the music mogul.The video from March 2016, obtained by CNN recorded at the now-closed InterContinental Hotel in Los Angeles, appears to corroborate Cassie’s claims. The footage shows Cassie leaving a hotel room, followed by Diddy, dressed in a towel. He grabs her by the neck, throws her to the floor, and kicks her twice while she lies motionless.Diddy is also seen dragging Cassie by her sweatshirt and hurling an object at her before sitting down in the hallway. The video ends with Diddy confronting her near the elevator. Prosecutors describe the video as undeniable evidence of abuse, while Diddy’s legal team alleges its release was improperly leaked to the media.In response to the video, Diddy posted a video statement on Instagram earlier this year. “My behaviour on that video is inexcusable. I take full responsibility for my actions in that video,” he admitted.“I was disgusted then when I did it. I’m disgusted now,” he added. “I sought therapy and rehab. I had to ask God for mercy and grace. I’m not asking for forgiveness. I’m truly sorry and committed to becoming a better man every day.”Prosecutors claim Sean “Diddy” Combs has tried to influence potential jurors and witnesses for his upcoming sex trafficking trial while incarcerated, in an attempt to sway public opinion and impact the case. In a Manhattan court filing, prosecutors opposed his $50 million bail request, arguing that jail calls show Combs asked family members to contact victims and witnesses, urging them to create narratives favorable to his defense.They also allege he orchestrated a social media campaign around his birthday to influence jurors. Combs, 55, faces charges of coercion, abuse, and blackmail, with prosecutors arguing he’s a flight risk and a danger to the community. This marks his third failed attempt for bail, following two rejections.","Leaked text messages between Cassie, the R&B artist and former partner of Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs, have unveiled harrowing details about the 2016 assault and their turbulent relationship.

The strike targeted enterprises and critical infrastructure in Dnipro, a central-eastern Ukrainian city. It is unclear whether the missile caused significant damage.Ukraine’s air force stated, “An intercontinental ballistic missile was launched from the Astrakhan region of the Russian Federation.”Security experts said it would be the first military use of an intercontinental ballistic missile, Reuters reported.The statement did not specify the missile type but identified that six Kh-101 cruise missiles were also launched, all of which except one were intercepted by Ukrainian air defences, reported CNN.In the 33-month long war, which doesn't seems to end soon, the war escalated after Ukraine used US-made ATACMS and British-French Storm Shadow missiles to strike targets deep within Russian territory. However, Russian defence ministry shot down two British-made Storm Shadow missiles, six HIMARS rockets and 67 drones.The Kremlin had previously warned that Ukraine’s use of Western long-range missiles would be seen as a major escalation.Ukrainian forces used these advanced weapons to hit Russian military installations earlier this week.Moscow responded with threats of “massive” retaliatory strikes, including the deployment of more advanced missile systems.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov declined to comment on the ICBM deployment. “That’s a question for our military,” he said.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that the word ""dignity"" defines Ukraine but it will never again be spoken about Russia.

Sex-trafficking allegations against Gaetz

When ethics committee launched an investigation



Tense confrontation between Gaetz and McCarthy

Former US representative Matt Gaetz announced on Thursday that he is withdrawing his name from consideration for President-elect Donald Trump's attorney general position , citing ongoing federal sex trafficking investigations that raised concerns about his suitability for the role. Gaetz said that his potential confirmation was becoming a distraction from the important work of the Trump/Vance transition.""I had excellent meetings with Senators yesterday. I appreciate their thoughtful feedback – and the incredible support of so many. While the momentum was strong, it is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition. There is no time to waste on a needlessly protracted Washington scuffle, thus I'll be withdrawing my name from consideration to serve as Attorney General,"" Gaetz posted on the social media platform X.However, this isn't the first time Gaetz has faced controversy. From inviting an internet troll to Trump 's state of the union address to his clashes with White House leader Kevin McCarthy, Gaetz has frequently made headlines. Here are some of his most notable controversies:Matt Gaetz faced criticism in 2018 after inviting Charles C Johnson to attend Trump's state of the union address. Johnson, known for his controversial presence online, attended the event as Gaetz's guest.When questioned by The Daily Beast about the invitation, Gaetz explained that Johnson “showed up at my office."" Johnson has previously drawn significant criticism for questioning the number of Jewish people killed in the Holocaust.Despite the backlash, Gaetz defended Johnson in an interview with Fox Business, saying: ""not a Holocaust denier"" and ""not a white supremacist.""In February 2019, Gaetz faced backlash for a controversial tweet about Trump’s former attorney, Michael Cohen , on the eve of Cohen's testimony before the House oversight committee.“Do your wife & father-in-law know about your girlfriends? Maybe tonight would be a good time for that chat. I wonder if she’ll remain faithful when you’re in prison. She’s about to learn a lot,” Gaetz wrote in a post on X.The tweet was later deleted following criticism from House Democrats.Gaetz then apologized, writing on X: “While it is important to create context around the testimony of liars like Michael Cohen, it was NOT my intent to threaten, as some believe I did. I’m deleting the tweet & I should have chosen words that better showed my intent. I’m sorry.”Although Democrats called for an ethics investigation into the incident, the House ethics committee ultimately cleared Gaetz of wrongdoing. However, the committee criticized him for conduct that did not “reflect creditably upon the House of Representatives.” Similarly, the Florida Bar reviewed the case and reached the same conclusion, though they also condemned Gaetz’s actions.The US justice department launched an investigation into sex-trafficking allegations against Gaetz during the final months of the Trump administration. The nearly three-year investigation aimed to determine whether Gaetz had paid for a 17-year-old girl's travel in violation of sex-trafficking laws, among other allegations.According to some of Gaetz's colleagues, the former Florida representative allegedly bragged about sexual encounters and showed them nude photos of women.Gaetz, however, denied all allegations of wrongdoing. In 2023, his office said that prosecutors had informed him he would not face charges.Joel Greenberg , a convicted fraudster who cooperated extensively with the justice department’s sex-trafficking investigation into Gaetz, was sentenced to 11 years in prison by a federal judge in Florida in 2022. Gaetz had referred to Greenberg, the former Seminole County tax collector, as his ""wingman.""Greenberg had previously pleaded guilty to charges including underage sex trafficking, wire fraud, stalking, identity theft, producing a fake ID, and conspiring to defraud the US government.Gaetz’s Venmo transactions with Greenberg were under scrutiny during the controversy.The House ethics committee began investigating Gaetz in 2021 following allegations of sexual misconduct and other claims. While the investigation was initially put on hold due to pending charges from the justice department, the committee resumed its inquiry in May 2023.The committee, known for its discretion, publicly said that it was investigating whether Gaetz had been involved in sexual misconduct, illegal drug use, accepted improper gifts, or obstructed investigations.According to The New York Times, lawmakers were prepared to vote on releasing their findings regarding Gaetz's conduct. However, before they could proceed, the Florida Republican unexpectedly resigned, shortly after Trump had nominated Gaetz for attorney general.Kevin McCarthy, then-House minority leader, was removed from his position as House speaker after a group of Republicans and Democrats voted to vacate the position in 2023. The effort was spearheaded by Gaetz, who had been a vocal critic of McCarthy since before his speakership.McCarthy's troubles began in January 2023 when Gaetz and several other lawmakers repeatedly voted against him during the initial speakership votes. The situation escalated after the 14th unsuccessful vote, culminating in a physical altercation between representative Mike Rogers and Gaetz. Despite the tension, McCarthy eventually secured enough votes to become speaker.However, Gaetz's opposition continued. In October 2023, he filed a motion to vacate the speakership, effectively forcing a vote on McCarthy's leadership. With support from seven other Republicans and Democrats, the motion passed, marking the first time in history that a House speaker was successfully removed.Gaetz cited policy differences as his reason for seeking McCarthy's removal. However, McCarthy publicly accused Gaetz of seeking personal revenge.The ongoing animosity between the two was evident at the 2024 Republican National Convention, where Gaetz interrupted a televised interview with McCarthy, asking, ""What night are you speaking?"" Security personnel subsequently escorted Gaetz away at the request of McCarthy's team.",Matt Gaetz announced on Thursday that he is withdrawing his name from consideration for President-elect Donald Trump's attorney general position. Gaetz said that his potential confirmation was becoming a distraction from the important work of the Trump/Vance transition.

Penny's account of events





Neely’s final moments

Witness accounts

Penny’s defense

Vigilantism or self-defense?

Daniel Penny, a 24-year-old Marine veteran, is on trial for second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide in the death of Jordan Neely , a 30-year-old homeless subway performer. The incident occurred on May 1, 2023, aboard an uptown F train in Manhattan, New York City, where Penny placed Neely in a fatal chokehold during an altercation.The case has divided New Yorkers, sparking debates about vigilante justice and subway safety. Prosecutors argue that Neely, while acting erratically, was non-violent, while Penny’s defense claims his actions were justified by Neely’s threatening behavior.In an interview with detectives shortly after the incident, Penny recounted Neely’s repeated threats, saying, “The three main threats that he repeated over and over were, ‘I’m going to kill you,’ ‘I’m prepared to go to jail for life,’ and ‘I’m willing to die.’”Penny refuted allegations that he intended to cause Neely’s death or that the restraint lasted 15 minutes, saying, “The whole interaction was less than five minutes. Some people say I was trying to choke him to death—which is also not true. You can see in the video there’s a clear rise and fall of his chest, indicating that he’s breathing.” He also demonstrated the hold he used, asserting it was designed to restrain rather than kill.Prosecutors allege that Penny failed to check Neely’s breathing or pulse after his body went limp, despite his first-aid training. Police arrived seven minutes after the first 911 call and found Neely unresponsive but with a faint pulse. Despite chest compressions and the administration of an overdose-reversal drug, Neely was pronounced dead.Ivette Rosario, a high school student, testified that she was frightened during Neely's outburst, describing it as unlike anything she had seen before, according to a Fox News report. Rosario recorded a video showing Penny holding Neely in a chokehold for nearly six minutes, even after Neely became unresponsive.Commuter Eric Gonzalez testified that he tried to de-escalate the situation by restraining Neely’s hands so Penny could release him, the Fox News report said. Another witness, Larry Goodson, recalled warning Penny: “If you don’t let him go, you’re going to lose him.”Penny has retained Thomas Kenniff, a former Republican candidate for district attorney, as his attorney. On May 5, 2023, Penny’s legal team released a statement expressing condolences to Neely’s family. The statement read, “Daniel never intended to harm Mr. Neely and could not have foreseen his untimely death. When Mr. Neely began aggressively threatening Daniel Penny and the other passengers, Daniel, with the help of others, acted to protect themselves until help arrived.”The defense contends that Neely aggressively approached a woman with a stroller, shouting that he would “kill,” which prompted Penny to intervene. However, prosecutors and some witnesses argue that Neely did not physically threaten anyone on the train.Penny’s legal team has stressed his military background and pointed out that he asked fellow passengers to call the police during the incident. They argue that he acted to protect others from a perceived threat. Prosecutors, however, contend that Penny’s use of force was excessive and directly caused Neely’s death, noting his failure to attempt lifesaving measures.If convicted, Daniel Penny faces up to 15 years in prison for manslaughter and up to four years for criminally negligent homicide.","Daniel Penny, a 24-year-old Marine veteran, is on trial for second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide in the death of Jordan Neely.

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief secretary Nadeem Aslam Chaudhry said the death toll could rise as the condition of 11 wounded people was critical.The convoys were carrying members of the Shia community, Kurram’s deputy commissioner Javedullah Mehsud said. Women and children sought refuge in local houses during the assault.The mountainous Kurram district has a long history of sectarian violence between Sunni and Shia groups. In recent years, it has become a hotspot for attacks by the Pakistan Taliban and Islamic State (IS) terrorists, both of which are vehemently anti-Shia.Kurram, a region with a large Taliban presence, has seen repeated clashes between Sunni and Shia tribes this year, often tied to land disputes. Violence in July led to an intertribal ceasefire signed on August 2, but tensions reignited in late Sept when 25 people were killed. More violence followed on Oct 12, when 15 people died in another convoy attack, prompting the closure of Kurram’s main highway.The Thall-Parachinar road had reopened in recent days for limited travel under police protection, but Thursday’s attack demonstrated the fragility of security in the area.Residents reported a tense atmosphere, with daily activities disrupted by road closures and a mobile internet blackout now in its third month.Pakistan home minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the attack on unarmed people, saying: “This past week has been difficult and upsetting.

It came a day after four people, including a tribal chief and a woman, were killed and as many injured when unknown armed men opened fire on a vehicle in Bannu.The latest attack, according to the army’s handout, triggered an exchange of fire in which six terrorists were gunned down and the attempt to enter the post effectively thwarted by troops, forcing the terrorists to detonate an explosives-laden vehicle at the post’s perimeter wall. “The suicide blast led to the collapse of a portion of the perimeter wall and damaged the adjoining infrastructure, as a result of which 12 soldiers lost their lives,” the statement added.There has been a sharp rise in the number of attacks targeting security forces, other law enforcement agencies, and security checkpoints, particularly in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Bannu has seen heightened militant violence of late, including the abductions of cops, attack on a prison, attack on a girls’ school, and shootouts that have left several security officials dead.On Monday, over half a dozen policemen were abducted from a checkpost in an adjacent North Waziristan tribal district. They were later recovered by police, with the help of tribal elders.Over the weekend at least eight security personnel were killed and three injured in fierce gun battles with militants in Tirah valley of Khyber tribal district, bordering Afghanistan.On Saturday, at least seven security officials were killed and 18 others wounded in Baluchistan’s Kalat region in a pre-dawn terrorist attack on a checkpost.

Imran Khan Bail: Former Pakistan PM Imran Khan granted bail by Islamabad high court in state gifts case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/former-pakistan-pm-imran-khan-granted-bail-by-islamabad-high-court-in-state-gifts-case/articleshow/115493396.cms,"Pakistan's former Prime Minister, Imran Khan, was granted bail on Wednesday by the Islamabad high court in a case involving the alleged illegal sale of state gifts . However, his release from prison remains uncertain as he continues to face multiple charges.The 71-year-old former cricketer has been behind bars since August 2023, serving a 14-year sentence alongside his wife, Bushra Bibi, in the Toshakhana, or state treasury, case. The case centers on accusations that the couple illegally acquired and sold state gifts worth over 140 million Pakistan rupees (£501,000) during Khan's tenure as prime minister from 2018 to 2022. Both Khan and his wife deny the allegations.The Toshakhana case alleges that Khan misused state-owned gifts, including diamond jewelry and seven luxury watches , six of which were Rolexes. Among the most expensive items listed is a watch valued at 85 million Pakistan rupees (£305,000).Bushra Bibi, who was arrested in July, was granted bail and released from Adiala Jail on October 24 after nearly nine months in custody. However, on Thursday, a trial court rejected the acquittal requests of both Khan and Bushra Bibi in the Toshakhana II case, which alleges financial losses to the national exchequer from their actions. The court ordered Khan to appear before the trial court after securing bail, warning that his bail could be revoked if he failed to cooperate.""If the official order is received today, his family and supporters will approach the authorities for his release,"" said Salman Safdar, one of Khan’s lawyers. He further claimed that Khan has either been granted bail or acquitted in all other cases he is currently facing.Despite being in jail, Khan’s political influence remains strong. PTI emerged as the largest bloc in February’s general election, although it fell short of a majority and lost. Khan's supporters claim that judicial proceedings are being used to suppress dissent, while the government insists it does not interfere with the judiciary.","Imran Khan was granted bail on Wednesday by the Islamabad high court in a case involving the alleged illegal sale of state gifts.
