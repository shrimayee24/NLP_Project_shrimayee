Connection to Gangster Aman Singh's Jail Murder

House Attached, Police Crack Down





LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh STF gunned down dreaded mafia criminal Ashish Ranjan alias Chhotu Singh, a resident of Dhanbad, Jharkhand, in an encounter near Shivrajpur Chauraha under Shankargarh police station limits in Prayagraj in the wee hours of Thursday.Ashish, wanted in at least four high-profile murder cases, including that of gangster Aman Singh, opened fire with an AK-47 rifle and a 9mm pistol at the STF team, prompting retaliatory action in which he was critically injured and later declared dead, said Additional DG, law and order, Amitabh Yash.ADG Yash said that acting on a tip-off that Ashish was en route to Prayagraj to possibly execute a major criminal plot with an associate, the STF laid a trap near Shivrajpur.“When intercepted, Ashish fired at the police team with lethal intent. STF officers JP Rai, Prabhanjan, and Rohit narrowly escaped bullets. In self-defence, the STF retaliated, injuring Ashish, who was rushed to a nearby hospital but succumbed to injuries,” said ADG Yash.From the spot, police recovered a loaded AK-47, 9mm pistol, large cache of live cartridges and spent shells, and a motorcycle. A case under multiple sections, including attempt to murder and Arms Act, has been lodged, and further investigation is underway, the officer added.STF said that Ashish had a long criminal history and was the prime accused in three high-profile murder cases in Dhanbad, including, the murder of police informer and coal trader Neeraj Tiwari in Katras on September 5, 2021. The murder of land dealer Sarful Hasan alias Lala Khan in Wasseypur on May 12, 2021. The murder of Ranjit Sahu in Jharia.Previously, Ashish had been jailed in the Samir Mandal land mafia murder case but was released on bail, after which he continued to commit heinous crimes. Jharkhand Police and CID had both been hunting him, and a permanent warrant had been issued against him.Ashish came into the spotlight after he claimed responsibility for the murder of mafia don Aman Singh inside Dhanbad Jail, in a viral audio-video confession. The feud reportedly began after Ashish accused Aman of plotting his murder. Police suspect the conspiracy to eliminate Aman was hatched in Nepal, where Ashish is believed to have been hiding before resurfacing in UP. A key accused in Aman’s murder, Ritesh Yadav alias Sundar Mahto, had told police that he met Ashish in Nepal days before the murder.Following his repeated absconding, police had already initiated property attachment proceedings at Ashish's residence in JC Mallick Road, Dhanbad, on orders of SDJM Poonam Kumari in September 2024.In two separate FIRs—one related to the murder of Neeraj Tiwari and the other involving land dealer Lala Khan—his house and belongings were seized by the local police. Ashish has over a dozen serious criminal cases registered against him.","Ashish Ranjan alias Chhotu Singh, a resident of Dhanbad, Jharkhand, was gunned down in an encounter near Shivrajpur Chauraha.

‘Khalid Ka Shivaji’ Sparks Maha Row Over Historical Distortion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/khalid-ka-shivaji-sparks-maha-row-over-historical-distortion/articleshow/123174160.cms,"Nagpur: Atop a gentle hill in Girad village in Wardha district, surrounded by lush greenery and revered equally by Hindu and Muslim devotees, stands the Sheikh Farid Dargah. A site known for harmony was used as a prominent plot in the Raj More-directed Marathi film, ‘Khalid Ka Shivaji', which has now triggered statewide controversy over an alleged historical distortion.The otherwise quiet village, 76km off Nagpur, has suddenly catapulted into the spotlight after the film slated for release on August 8, was selected for Cannes Film Festival. The movie features several key scenes, including a zilla parishad school along with the dargah and its scenic landscape. While the village itself is not the source of protest, the film has inadvertently pulled Girad into the narrative.The film follows a young Muslim boy whose worldview is transformed after reading about Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj . However, right-wing groups have accused the filmmaker of twisting facts for communal appeasement. Protesters say the film falsely claims 35% of Shivaji's army was Muslim and even depicts a mosque on Raigad Fort, which they say amounts to historical misrepresentation. Protests erupted after two individuals interrupted CM Devendra Fadnavis's speech during the recent Maharashtra Marathi Film Awards in Mumbai and demanded a ban on the film.According to a local gramsevak, a 30-member film crew arrived in Girad last year and conducted a five-day shoot at various spots around the dargah. The team secured proper permission from the sub-divisional officer (SDO) for filming. During the shoot, the crew reportedly stayed at Jamb, a village near Hinganghat, 25 km from the location. The film's visuals of the dargah, open fields, and school in the background now stand out in the trailer, which has gone viral amid heated political reactions.Amid mounting backlash, cultural affairs minister Ashish Shelar has taken a firm stand. Talking to TOI, Shelar said, ""Distortion of history is absolutely unacceptable. We've written to the Union ministry of information and broadcasting to re-examine the film and reconsider the certificate issued by Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC)."" He also questioned how the film passed review and added that an investigation will be conducted into how it was selected for Cannes Film Festival, raising concerns about possible procedural lapses.According to platforms like News Bharati, which is ‘loosely' linked to Sangh Parivar, the film falsely claims 35% of Shivaji Majaraj's army was Muslim, and erroneously depicts a mosque on Raigad Fort, which is an assault on the Maratha warrior's legacy.",Right-wing groups have accused the filmmaker of twisting facts for communal appeasement.

Chandigarh: A declaration form issued by Panjab University for girls' hostel residents has reignited questions over student autonomy, with many alleging it marks a quiet erosion of the 24x7 access rights won after a landmark protest in 2018. The form requires parents to state whether they allow their daughters to leave the hostel ""at any time during the day/night"" and authorises the university to inform them if the student stays out overnight or frequently returns after midnight.Students say the move effectively brings back curbs through parental surveillance and dilutes the spirit of the 48-day agitation of 2018, which had pushed for equal mobility rights for women on campus. What has further angered students is that the form also includes the day- raising concerns that even regular daytime outings could now be subjected to scrutiny.Introduced last year, the form was rolled out after the death of a MSc student during an outing. Her parents, who were aware of her health conditions, had later told university officials they had no idea she regularly left the hostel at night and were unaware that the hostel permitted 24x7 access.The administration said it began receiving similar concerns from multiple parents after the incident.PU Dean Students Welfare Professor Amit Chauhan said the form was a middle path to reassure families without compromising student freedoms. ""Most parents are not opposed to 24x7 entry, but they expect some communication if their child is out the whole night or repeatedly out beyond midnight. This isn't about policing, it's about transparency and building a mutual understanding between the university, students, and their families,"" he said.However, student groups have strongly opposed the move. ""The right is for students, not their parents. Instead of blindly imposing such forms, the university should clearly tell parents that 24x7 access is a reality and that this right exists irrespective of their approval,"" said Sarah from PSU Lalkar.While the university maintains that the declaration is precautionary, many students believe it quietly reinstates institutional control under the cover of consent, chipping away at a freedom they fought hard to secure.""Such affidavits concerning ‘wards' effectively undermine the autonomy of women students who are 18 years or older, legally recognised as adults capable of voting, and shift accountability away from the authorities responsible for ensuring campus safety,"" said Kanupriya, who led the 2018 movement as PUCSC president.","Panjab University has issued a declaration form for girls' hostel residents.

Long-term rebuilding and heritage conservation Better preparedness to prevent future damage

DEHRADUN: The Kheer Gad river surged through without warning, tearing through Dharali - a village that holds its history in the soil. The flash flood halved the settlement, destroying homes and orchards, and burying what little remained of its oldest monument: the Kalp Kedar temple, a shrine dedicated to Shiva and, as local lore has it, built by the Pandavas during their exile.Only the temple's dome - long visible above ground since a glacial shift in the early 20th century submerged the rest - had endured.Carved with the face of Kalabhairava, it remained a visible fragment of something larger and unseen. Now, that too is gone, covered by fresh silt, boulders and broken timber. The Shivling has stayed hidden beneath earth and water for generations.In the 1980s, residents had tried to excavate the structure, but the Shivling never emerged - as though resisting visibility. That mirrored the lore: Shiva, unwilling to grant the Pandavas absolution, is said to have scattered himself across the Himalayas, each fragment becoming a site of worship. Kalp Kedar, believed by locals to be a prototype of Kedarnath, was one of those pieces - half-visible, always revered. ""This wasn't just a flood. It took the heart of the village,"" said Manoj Rana, former pradhan, surveying the damage.Set at an altitude of 650 metres (2,100 feet) above sea level, it was once a key halt on the Indo-Tibetan trade route.The Bhotia traders moved wool and salt through these hills, and many settled in nearby Bagori and Harsil, blending Buddhist and Hindu traditions. While Dharali does not lie on the formal Panch Kedar route, villagers consider Kalp Kedar part of that sacred constellation - not geographically, but spiritually. Its submerged form, they believe, was no accident but part of the same divine refusal that defines the myth: a god withdrawing from view, leaving only fragments behind. Brijesh Sati, general secretary of the Char Dham Teerth Purohit Mahapanchayat, said, ""The temple was near the bridge. Kalp Kedar had immense importance for the region. It was restored by Adi Shankracharya and worshipped as one of the oldest shrines to Shiva.""In the village's modern history came the British deserter Frederick Wilson, known locally as Pahadi Wilson, who made Harsil his home in the mid-19th century. He introduced apple saplings and red rajma to the region - both of which reshaped Dharali's economy. Today, the village exports apples across northern India. The trees remain, but the terraces along the river were swept away this week. Several orchards were flattened. Footbridges leading to fields were carried off downstream. Entire homes - including those belonging to long-settled families - were torn in half.Just 6km from Harsil, Dharali also serves as a base for Himalayan treks, including the Gaumukh-Tapovan and Lama Top routes. It lies close to Gartang Gali, a century-old wooden bridge carved into the rock face that was once used by Indo-Tibetan traders. But Dharali has never been a destination in itself. It has existed between paths - passed through, not always visited, known more to pilgrims and orchardists than to tourists.","Dharali was once a key halt on the Indo-Tibetan trade route. The flash flood halved the settlement, destroying homes and orchards. It also buried what little remained of its oldest monument: the Kalp Kedar temple.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123130981,imgsize-88678,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/123130981.jpg"

The Kakori revolutionaries were young, brave Indians who risked everything for freedom from British rule. From poets to scholars, these men—like Azad, Bismil, and Ashfaqullah—used both words and weapons in their fight for independence.Chandrashekhar Azad left home at the age of 15 left home and worked as a labourer in Bombay before heading to Varanasi where he joined a Sanskrit school and participated in the freedom struggle. It was during this movement that he was arrested and sentenced to 15 lashes. With each strike, he shouted ‘Mahatma Gandhi ki Jai! When his name was asked in court, he said “Azad”, meaning “free”, declaring that his father’s name was “Swatantrata” (freedom) and his residence was “jail”.The name stuck, and Chandrashekhar was known as ‘Azad’ forever. He played a key role in the Kakori Train Action. Bhagat Singh once joked, “Panditji, if caught, you’ll surely be hanged.” Azad replied, “Let that be your fate. As long as my ‘Bamtul Bukhara’ (his pistol’s nickname) is in my hand, no one can catch me alive”. True to his word, on Feb 27, 1931, cornered by the police at Alfred Park in Allahabad, he fought valiantly and shot himself instead of surrender.He was the only Muslim hero in the Kakori Train Action who sacrificed his life for the country. Born on Oct 22, 1900, in UP’s Shahjahanpur, he was lovingly called ‘Achchu’. A passionate Urdu poet who wrote under the pen name ‘Hasrat’. He was a close friend of Ram Prasad Bismil, who was initially hesitant to include him in the revolutionary group. Before the incident, he had warned his comrades: “This will be a direct confrontation with the British, and they will leave no stone unturned to destroy us. ” After his arrest, he was taken from Delhi to Lucknow. British officers tried to use religious pressure through Muslim clerics and relatives, but Ashfaq replied “Let me die with honour.” At Faizabad jail, he walked to the gallows carrying the Quran, saying ‘Labbaik’ (Here I am, O Lord!). Before his hanging, he said: “My hands are not stained with human blood. God will give me justice.)”He was not just a freedom fighter but a poet, writer, and translator whose pen and pistol worked in harmony for the nation. From a young age, Bismil was drawn to the idea of Arya Samaj. This exposure led him to join the revolutionary path during his adolescence. His poetic spirit flourished alongside his activism. He wrote powerful patriotic poems under the pen name ‘Bismil’, meaning ‘deeply wounded’. His greatest literary legacy remains his autobiography, secretly written in Gorakhpur Jail days before his hanging. Bismil was a founding member of HRA. After a long trial, Bismil and his closest associates were sentenced to death. Offered bribes and clemency in exchange for testimony, Bismil stood unshaken. On Dec 19, 1927, at the age of 30, Bismil was hanged in Gorakhpur Jail.Born in 1893 in a Bengali family in Banaras, Sanyal represented the new generation of revolutionaries. He was a key member of the Gadar Party and the Anushilan Samiti, which he helped establish in Banaras. During WW I, he was a close associate of Ras Bihari Bose. Sanyal was arrested in the Banaras Conspiracy Case and sentenced to life imprisonment in the Andaman Islands, where he wrote the book ‘Bandi Jeevan’. Released in 1920, he returned to revolutionary activities. In 1923, he founded the Hindustan Republican Association. He was a key strategist of the Kakori Train Action and arranged for 50 advanced Mauser pistols to be smuggled into India for the operation. In Kakori Action, Sanyal was again awarded life term. He was released in 1937 but rearrested in 1940. He died ofTB in 1943. His famous pamphlet, ‘The Revolutionary’, articulated revolutionaries’ goal of establishing a democratic and socialistic society.He was born in Bengal and, like his patriotic father, was deeply committed to India’s freedom. Sent to Banaras for education, he became active in literary circles and edited a revolutionary-leaning monthly magazine ‘Agnidoot’. He was a key figure in the Hindustan Republican Association, serving as its district organizer in Banaras. Lahiri played an active role in Kakori Train Action, where he was one of the revolutionaries who pulled the train’s chain to stop it. He was later arrested while learning to make bombs in Calcutta and sentenced to 10 years jail. When his involvement in the Kakori case was discovered, he was brought to Lucknow where he was sentenced to death. On Dec 17, 1927, he was executed in Gonda Jail, two days earlier than planned, reportedly to foil a rescue attempt. Before his execution, he performed his daily exercises, telling a magistrate he wanted to be strong in his next life to continue fighting for India’s independence.He was a leading revolutionary from Dhaka and a key figure in Kakori Action. He was initially sentenced to 10 years, which was later increased to life imprisonment. Chatterjee played a crucial role in organizing the Hindustan Republican Association in Uttar Pradesh. During World War I, he was arrested and later released under a general amnesty. He immediately rejoined the revolutionary movement, helping to build a strong network in Kanpur. After Kakori Action, he led hunger strikes in jail to protest the inhumane treatment of political prisoners, which forced the govt to concede to their demands. Released in 1937, he was rearrested for defying a ban on entering Delhi and was imprisoned again during World War II. He participated in a famous hunger strike at the Deoli detention camp, which severely affected his health and led to his release. After India’s independence, he served as a Rajya Sabha member.Born in 1892, Thakur Roshan Singh was a skilled fighter proficient in lathi, sword, and rifle. Inspired by Arya Samaj ideals, he actively participated in the Non-Cooperation Movement, even serving a two-year prison sentence. After the Chauri Chaura incident, he became disillusioned with non-violence and joined Bismil’s revolutionary circle. In 1924, during a robbery for funds, Roshan Singh shot and killed a villager, which later became the sole reason for his death sentence. Although not directly involved in Kakori train action, he was arrested as an accomplice. He was hanged on Dec 19, 1927.","Chandrashekhar Azad left home at the age of 15 left home and worked as a labourer in Bombay before heading to Varanasi where he joined a Sanskrit school.

‘Mumbai next’: Threat after Surrey cafe shooting

NEW DELHI/BATHINDA: Unidentified gunmen fired at comedian Kapil Sharma ’s cafe in Surrey, Canada, yet again on Thursday. This was the second shooting at Kap’s Cafe within a month.Around 9-10 shots were fired at the restaurant, of which at least six hit its walls and windows. Thankfully, like the last time, nobody was injured. Several residents called police control around 4.30am after hearing gunshots, prompting the dispatch of several police units.A social media post — whose authenticity is not verified— sur faced after the shooting in which a man named Goldy Dhillon, an associate of Lawrence Bishnoi and Goldy Brar, claimed responsibility for the attack.Indian agencies are verifying the authenticity of the post which says that the gangsters had called Sharma but as he didn’t answer they had to act.The post threatens that the gang’s next operation will be in Mumbai. On July 9, shots were fired at Kap’s Cafe by a shooter who was wearing a body-camera and filming the shooting.Germany-based Babbar Khalsa International (BKI) terrorist Harjeet Singh Laddi had claimed responsibility for the attack. This time too, the shooter filmed the act and released the footage on social media platforms. Both incidents remain unsolved with Surrey cops struggling to get any leads.Kap’s Cafe had recently been inaugurated as Sharma's first international restaurant venture.After last month’s shooting, BKI operative Laddi claimed that it was retribution for some claims purportedly made on Sharma's show in the past. Laddi is a notorious pro-Khalistan operative and a most-wanted fugitive for India's National Investigation Agency (NIA).In a social media post, Laddi had said: “In an episode of Kapil Sharma's comedy show, a character made some humorous remarks about the dress or behaviour of Nihang Sikhs. We tried to contact Kapil Sharma's manager by calling him several times, but there was no response from him. All our calls were ignored. If Kapil Sharma doesn't apologise publicly...”Issuing a threat to Sharma and other Indian-origin businessmen in Canada, SFJ chief Gurpatwant Singh Pannun said: “To Kapil Sharma and every other Modi-brand Hindutva investor: Canada is not your playground. Take your blood money back to Hindustan. Canada will not allow violent Hindutva ideology to take root on Canadian soil under the guise of business”.Sharing a video clip on his Instagram account about the visit of Surrey Mayor Brenda Locke along with officials and police personnel, Sharma wrote, “Thank you to the Mayor of Surrey Brenda Locke and all the officials who visited Kaps’ Cafe to show their love and support, united we stand against violence, we are truly grateful.”Earlier, an attack was made at the property of Punjabi singer Karan Aujla at Surrey in 2019.Gunshots were also reportedly fired at the residence of Punjabi singer Gippy Grewal in Vancouver, on Nov 26, 2023, followed by an attack at the residence of Punjabi artist A P Dhillon at Colwood, Vancouver Island, on Sept 2, 2024.","Unidentified gunmen fired at comedian Kapil Sharma ’s cafe in Surrey, Canada, yet again on Thursday.

Israel's 'Secret' Syria Raid: IDF Paratroopers Storm 4 Sites In South Syria As Sweida Truce Frays





Federal officials have launched an investigation into former special counsel Jack Smith after US President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers accused him of engaging in illegal political activity during his investigations into Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign.The US office of special counsel (OSC), an independent federal agency, confirmed to NBC News on Saturday that it is looking into Smith for possible violations of the Hatch Act- a law that bars certain political activities by federal employees.The OSC is distinct from the justice department’s special counsel’s office, which Smith led during his investigation into Trump.While the OSC cannot bring criminal charges, it can recommend disciplinary action such as removal from the federal workforce. It may also refer findings to the Department of Justice, although that is uncommon.Senator Tom Cotton, R-Ark., formally requested the investigation on Wednesday, accusing Smith of “unprecedented interference in the 2024 election.”Smith was appointed special counsel by then-attorney general Merrick Garland in November 2022, just three days after Trump announced his presidential bid. He later brought two criminal indictments against Trump in 2023 but stepped down from the role slightly more than a week before Trump’s inauguration in January 2024.Neither case reached trial.“Jack Smith’s legal actions were nothing more than a tool for the Biden and Harris campaigns,” Cotton said in a post on X Wednesday. “This isn’t just unethical, it is very likely illegal campaign activity from a public office.”Cotton also claimed Smith pushed for a “rushed trial” of Trump, though he has not released specific evidence of illegal conduct.Hatch Act violations are rarely referred to the DOJ. In 2019, the OSC recommended then-President Trump remove White House counselor Kellyanne Conway for Hatch Act violations, but the issue did not lead to prosecution.Meanwhile, Trump’s nominee to lead the OSC, Paul Ingrassia, remains stalled in the senate. A White House official said that Ingrassia, a former podcast host with a history of controversial remarks, is currently holding one-on-one meetings with senators as part of the confirmation process.","Federal officials have launched an investigation into former special counsel Jack Smith.

Trump Rages At Schumer As Senate Talks Collapse, Nominations And Budget Face Gridlock





US President Trump launched a scathing attack on senate minority leader Chuck Schumer on Saturday, telling him to “GO TO HELL” after the Senate left Washington for its August recess without confirming over 130 of his executive branch nominees.A deal between Republicans and Democrats collapsed, and many key appointments remain stalled. Trump had urged the Senate to stay in session, but negotiations failed— leaving dozens of political appointees in limbo and the president fuming.“Senator Cryin’ Chuck Schumer is demanding over One Billion Dollars in order to approve a small number of our highly qualified nominees, who should right now be helping to run our Country,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.Trump was reacting to what he described as an unreasonable demand by Senate Democrats, accusing Schumer of tying nominee approvals to a $1 billion funding request, reported The New York Post.“This demand is egregious and unprecedented, and would be embarrassing to the Republican Party if it were accepted. It is political extortion, by any other name. Tell Schumer, who is under tremendous political pressure from within his own party, the Radical Left Lunatics, to GO TO HELL!” he addedTrump followed up with urging Republicans to hold firm and use the recess to rally public support, rather than accepting a compromise with Democrats.“Do not accept the offer, go home and explain to your constituents what bad people the Democrats are, and what a great job the Republicans are doing, and have done, for our Country. Have a great RECESS and, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!”Senate majority leader John Thune acknowledged the failed negotiations and the multiple attempts to reach an agreement with Schumer before recess. “There were several different times where I think either or both sides maybe thought there was a deal in the end.”Thune had been working with Schumer on a proposal to bundle nominee votes into two rounds—one before the recess and another afterward. But Democrats were reportedly seeking guarantees from Trump to restore funding for foreign aid and the National Institutes of Health, which the administration had frozen.The breakdown led to frustration on both sides, and senators were eager to begin their August break.Schumer, under pressure from his party’s progressive base, later celebrated the failure of the confirmation deal.“Let me clear what happened: Donald Trump attempted to steamroll the Senate to put in place his historically unqualified nominees. But Senate Democrats wouldn’t let him,” he said in a post on X Sunday.“Donald Trump’s style: Posture[,] Cajole[,] Stamp your feet… and then give up,” he added in a follow up post.With the deal dead, some Republicans suggested changing Senate rules to prevent Democrats from blocking confirmations. However, moderate GOP senators were reluctant, fearing the same rules could be used against them in the future.Thune allowed the Senate to continue holding pro forma sessions, ceremonial meetings that block Trump from making recess appointments, ensuring his nominees cannot be confirmed without Senate votes. Although the Senate passed three of twelve required appropriations bills, several key funding bills remain stuck in committee.According to senate appropriations chair Susan Collins, it marks the first time since 2018 that any funding bills were passed before the August recess. If the remaining bills aren’t approved by October 1, the government faces a partial shutdown, The New York Post reported.","US President Donald Trump launched a scathing attack on senate minority leader Chuck Schumer.

South Korea's impeached former president Yoon Suk Yeol lay on the floor of his prison cell wearing only an undershirt and boxer shorts to resist questioning, prosecutors said Friday, after a fresh attempt to bring him in for interrogation over election tampering allegations failed.Although already in custody on charges related to his attempt to impose martial law in December, prosecutors were required to serve a new warrant to question him in a separate case involving his wife, Kim Keon-hee.Assistant special prosecutor Oh Jeong-hee said a team of special prosecutors attempted to execute the warrant but were forced to abandon the effort after Yoon refused to cooperate.“The special prosecutors urged him to voluntarily comply with the arrest warrant, taking into account his status as a former president,” Oh said as quoted by South China Morning Post. “But the suspect persistently refused, remaining on the floor and declining to put on his prison uniform.”Prosecutors repeated the request four times over 20- to 30-minute intervals before halting the operation after two hours, citing concerns that using physical force might lead to harm.“During the process, the suspect was informed that the next attempt to execute the warrant would proceed even with the use of physical force,” Oh added.She noted that Yoon had long championed “rule of law, fairness, and common sense,” adding, “The public is closely watching whether the law is applied equally to all. We hope the suspect, who once served as a prosecutor, prosecutor general and president, will respect and comply with legal procedures.”Jhee Byong-kuen, a political science professor at Chosun University, criticised Yoon’s actions. “No criminal defies the rule of law in such a disgraceful way,” he said, as cited by South China Morning Post. “The former leader is showing no remorse and portraying himself as a victim of political persecution.”Yoon was first arrested on January 15 by the corruption investigation office for high-ranking officials on charges of insurrection and abuse of power. He was released after 52 days due to procedural issues, but rearrested on July 10 on new charges, including obstruction of official duties. Since then, he has refused to leave his cell for questioning. Prosecutors later added charges, alleging he instructed his security team to interfere with his earlier arrest.He is also resisting a separate probe into alleged election meddling involving his wife. The couple is accused of influencing People Power Party nominations for local and National Assembly elections.In April, the Constitutional Court upheld Yoon’s impeachment, originally passed by the National Assembly in response to the martial law attempt.","South Korea's impeached former president Yoon Suk Yeol lay on the floor of his prison cell wearing only an undershirt and boxer shorts to resist questioning, prosecutors said.

Cincinnati street brawl: Vivek Ramaswamy donates to attack victim 'Holly'; fundraiser tops $100K,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cincinnati-street-brawl-vivek-ramaswamy-donates-to-attack-victim-holly-fundraiser-tops-100k/articleshow/123074050.cms,"



Ohio gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy has made a significant donation to a GiveSendGo fundraiser supporting a woman named Holly, who was assaulted during a violent mob attack in downtown Cincinnati.The incident, which went viral, showed Holly being punched while trying to help another victim during the chaotic street brawl.American commentator and YouTuber Benny Johnson shared a screenshot of Ramaswamy’s donation, writing on X, ""Wow. @VivekGRamaswamy just made an incredibly generous donation to Holly’s GiveSendGo. Thank you to all who’ve shown up for her. 100% goes to Holly.""The fundraiser has now surpassed $100,000 in donations. ""We have now officially raised $100,000 for Holly in just one night. This is one of the most successful GiveSendGo campaigns in history,"" Johnson posted earlier.Ramaswamy had earlier condemned the attack and criticised the absence of police and emergency services.Earlier, in a post on X, he wrote, ""It’s unconscionable that there were no police present in that area of Cincinnati on a Friday night, or even an ambulance to take her to the hospital.Hard-working Americans shouldn’t have to worry for their safety when they have a good time in our cities.”He added that Holly, a single working mother, told him no public official aside from one detective had contacted her. ""Leftists like to lecture about ‘systemic injustice’ while thugs turn our cities into war zones. I’m done with their excuses,"" Ramaswamy said.If elected in the coming year, Ramaswamy declared, ""We're going to set an example for what that looks like in Ohio.""The viral video of the incident shows a man being chased into the street, shoved to the ground, and beaten by a crowd.One individual body-slams him while others kick and stomp him. As the man tries to get up, a woman, later identified as Holly, rushes to help, only to be punched twice in the face.She collapses to the pavement, hitting her head and bleeding from the mouth as the crowd continues to cheer.The clip has sparked outrage and renewed calls for better safety and policing in urban areas.","Ohio gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy has made a significant donation to a GiveSendGo fundraiser supporting a woman named Holly.

‘Trains CCP’s future leaders’: Report accuses Harvard of having decade-long ties to Chinese Communist Party; Congress demands all records by August 7,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trains-ccps-future-leaders-report-accuses-harvard-of-having-decade-long-ties-to-chinese-communist-party-congress-demands-all-records-by-august-7/articleshow/123075549.cms,"Trump’s Big China Fear Over Harvard: Millions In Funds, Communist Influence And More

Trump-Harvard row







Harvard University is facing backlash after a congressional probe revealed years-long partnerships with organisations tied to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).The revelation sparked concerns over foreign influence and national security risks.According to documents obtained by the Washington Free Beacon, the Ivy League institution allegedly collaborated with CCP-controlled entities for over a decade.The foreign bodies included the Central Organisation Department, the powerful organ responsible for training and selecting China’s top officials.A general focus of the investigation is the Harvard Kennedy School’s partnership with the Chinese Executive Leadership Academy Pudong, a government-run training school.Whistleblowers have claimed that Chinese government and party officials were sent to Harvard as part of their official education, prompting bipartisan alarm.“Harvard’s formal partnership with a CCP-controlled school to train their future leaders raises serious concerns about the CCP’s influence in American institutions,” said representative John Moolenaar.“We are committed to uncovering the full extent of these relationships to ensure transparency and protect national interests,"" he added.Furthermore, representatives Tim Walberg and Elise Stefanik co-signed a letter accusing Harvard of working directly with groups formed by CCP ideology, particularly ""Xi Jinping Thought"".The scandal adds to mounting pressure on the university, which is reportedly considering $500 million payout to settle disputes with US President Donald Trump and his administration over alleged campus anti-Semitism and its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies.In April, the Free Beacon also reported that Harvard had trained members of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, a paramilitary group sanctioned by the US for its involvement in the repression of Uyghur Muslims.Congress has given Harvard until August 7 to turn over all records tied to its dealings with CCP-linked bodies, including financial or material exchanges.Harvard University and the Trump administration have been at odds since the MAGA chief assumed office in January.In April 2025, the administration froze approximately $2.2–2.6 billion in federal research funding and revoked Harvard’s certification to host international students, citing alleged failures to tackle antisemitic harassment and ideological bias. In response, Harvard filed lawsuits claiming federal overreach and threats to academic freedom.Earlier this week, reports surfaced that the White House had proposed a settlement of up to $500 million, but Harvard President Alan Garber denied any imminent agreement, calling the figure false and leaked by administration sources. He emphasised that any deal must not compromise the university’s freedom to govern academic affairs independently.The battle has drawn intense scrutiny from faculty, students, alumni, and congressional Democrats.On Friday, fourteen Democratic legislators—many of them Harvard alumni—warned that any settlement under political pressure could prompt a congressional investigation, arguing that yielding to the White House risks setting a dangerous precedent for institutional autonomy across US higher education.Meanwhile, faculty groups have continued to mobilise, demanding red lines on issues such as external monitoring, data-sharing, and control over admissions and hiring.","Harvard University is facing backlash after a congressional probe revealed years-long partnerships with organisations tied to the Chinese Communist Party.

The US Senate on Saturday confirmed Jeanine Pirro, a well-known Fox News personality and President Donald Trump loyalist, to a high-profile federal prosecutor role in Washington, DC.With a vote count of 50-45, Pirro secured confirmation as the US Attorney for the District of Columbia. Trump encouraged the Republican-controlled Senate to process his nominations during weekend sessions, following his return to the White House six months prior.Trump provisionally appointed Pirro to the role in May, continuing his pattern of selecting hosts from the conservative television network and steadfast supporters for influential governmental positions.Trump previously praised the outspoken 74-year-old former Westchester County district attorney when he nominated her, as being ""in a class by herself.""Jeanine Pirro is a former judge, prosecutor, and prominent conservative television personality, best known for her outspoken commentary on Fox News.Before rising to national media fame, Pirro built a lengthy legal career in New York. She served as the district attorney of Westchester County from 1994 to 2005, becoming the first woman to hold that position.During her tenure, she established the nation’s first domestic violence prosecution unit, according to the US Justice Department.Earlier in her career, she also served as a county judge.Pirro transitioned to television in the 2000s, hosting shows like Judge Jeanine Pirro (2008–2011) and Justice with Judge Jeanine on Fox News, which ran for over a decade.She later became a co-host on Fox’s popular roundtable show The Five. Her on-air segments often included inflammatory rhetoric and conspiracy theories—particularly surrounding the 2020 election—which at times led to temporary removals from the network lineup.She joins a growing list of cable news figures with political roles, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, both of whom had careers at Fox.Pirro is also a published author. Her 2018 book, Liars, Leakers, and Liberals: The Case Against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy, was described by The Washington Post as overly loyal to Donald Trump.Her personal life has not been without controversy. Her ex-husband, Albert Pirro, was convicted of tax evasion during her time as district attorney and later received a pardon from Trump during his presidency.Earlier, the Senate Judiciary Committee's leading Democrat, Dick Durbin, opposed Pirro's permanent appointment as US Attorney, describing her selection as a ""rubber stamp for Donald Trump.""Durbin referenced her role in spreading conspiracy theories about the 2020 election, which Trump lost to Biden, AP reported.Pirro was sued by Dominion Voting Systems after she promoted false claims of election fraud on Fox News. The company accused Fox of airing defamatory statements about its role in the vote count. Fox later settled the lawsuit for around $800 million.","The US Senate confirmed Jeanine Pirro, 74, to a high-profile federal prosecutor role in Washington, DC.

US Police continued scouring the rugged mountains of Montana on Saturday as the search for Michael Paul Brown, a 45-year-old military veteran accused of fatally shooting four people at The Owl Bar in Anaconda, entered its second day.Brown fled the scene in a white pickup truck, which was later abandoned, according to Lee Johnson of the Montana Division of Criminal Investigation. Johnson urged residents Friday night to stay indoors and remain alert.Authorities also released a photo of Brown, reportedly taken as he fled. In the image, he appears gaunt, barefoot, and dressed only in black shorts while walking down a set of outdoor concrete steps.""While law enforcement has not received reports of Brown harming any other individuals, he is believed to be armed, and he is extremely dangerous,"" Johnson said, the Associated Press reported.Brown's military service included Army deployment to Iraq (2004-2005) and Montana National Guard service until March 2009, reaching sergeant rank.His niece, Clare Boyle, indicated Brown's ongoing mental health challenges: ""This isn't just a drunk/high man going wild,"" she said via Facebook.""It's a sick man who doesn't know who he is sometimes and frequently doesn't know where or when he is either,"" Boyle added.The search concentrated near Stumptown Road, west of Anaconda, involving multiple agencies at ground level and in the air. Local businesses were permitted to operate, though Chief Bill Sather advised vigilance.Victim identifications await family notifications.The bar owner, David Gwerder, confirmed Brown lived adjacent to the establishment. The victims included the bartender and three customers.""He knew everybody that was in that bar. I guarantee you that,"" Gwerder told AP. ""He didn't have any running dispute with any of them.

ISLAMABAD:

‘Trump Angry As India Denies Nobel Push, Rejects' Mediation In Operation Sindoor Ceasefire | WATCH





In a symbolic assertion of strategic alignment, Pakistan’s military hosted on Friday a grand ceremony at General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi to mark the 98th anniversary of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA), showcasing its deepening defence partnership with Beijing.The event came soon after a surprise 19% tariff on Pakistani imports announced by US President Donald Trump just days after Washington and Islamabad concluded new trade deals.While the tariff decision is believed to have been discussed between the two sides as part of broader trade negotiations, Trump’s typically blunt commentary on social media appeared aimed more at India than Pakistan. In recent days, Trump has taken jabs at New Delhi over its continued purchase of Russian oil and defence equipment, while casting Pakistan in a more favourable light.At GHQ, however, Pakistan’s military made its strategic loyalties unambiguous. Army Chief Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir hosted Chinese ambassador Jiang Zaidong and PLA defence attaché Maj Gen Wang Zhong at a ceremony that included military tributes, visuals of joint defence hardware, and strong political messaging. Munir described the Pakistan-China relationship as a “beacon of mutual trust and shared destiny” and referred to the PLA and Pakistan Army as “iron brothers”.The messaging was clear: Pakistan is reaffirming its long-standing alignment with China even as it navigates transactional ties with Washington and economic turbulence at home. With IMF conditionalities tightening and Western funding streams growing unpredictable, Islamabad continues to anchor itself in Beijing’s strategic orbit, particularly through projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).For China, the event was a diplomatic win. As Beijing faces intensifying rivalry with the US across the Indo-Pacific, its deepening influence over a nuclear-armed ally in South Asia reinforces its foothold in the region. The GHQ ceremony was a visual and political endorsement of China’s role as Islamabad’s primary defence and development partner.With Pakistan and China enhancing defence cooperation and projecting unity, New Delhi faces a more tightly aligned northern bloc just as it expands its own security ties with the US and with Indo-Pacific allies.Despite the potential economic fallout of the US tariffs, Rawalpindi appears undeterred. In an era of fluid alliances, Pakistan is betting on consistency with Beijing over the unpredictability of Western partners, a gamble that could reshape the regional balance in the years ahead.",Pakistan's military hosted a grand ceremony to mark the 98th anniversary of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) The event came soon after a surprise 19% tariff on Pakistani imports announced by US President Donald Trump.

A Pakistani anti-terrorism court on Thursday sentenced more than 100 members of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan 's party to prison terms on charges related to riots that targeted military sites in 2023, a court order said.Fifty-eight of the defendants, who included parliamentarians and senior officials, were sentenced to 10 years in prison and the rest were given sentences ranging from one to three years, the court said.The accused include Omar Ayub Khan and Shibli Faraz, the leaders of Khan's opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party (PTI) in the lower and upper houses of parliament respectively, the court order seen by Reuters read.""The prosecution has proved its case against the accused without a shadow of doubt,"" it said in announcing the sentences.Khan, who has been in prison since 2023 facing charges of corruption, land fraud and disclosure of official secrets, is being tried separately on similar charges related to the riot.The government accuses him and other leaders of inciting the May 9, 2023, protests, during which demonstrators attacked military and government buildings, including the army headquarters in Rawalpindi.He denies wrongdoing and says all the cases are politically motivated as part of a military-backed crackdown to dismantle his party. The military denies it.Khan's arrest had prompted the countrywide violent protests.Thursday's ruling does not directly affect the incitement case against him in which prosecution is still presenting witnesses.The PTI party said it will challenge the verdict.The ruling is the third such mass conviction this month; Khan's party says they have included at least 14 of its parliamentarians.They will lose their seats in parliament under Pakistani laws, which will shred Khan's opposition party's strength.Another 77 were acquitted for lack of evidence in the latest verdict, which is linked to an attack on the office of an intelligence agency in eastern city of Faisalabad, the court said.The party plans new protests starting on August 5, the second anniversary of Khan's jailing, to demand his release.","Fifty-eight of the defendants, who included parliamentarians and senior officials, were sentenced to 10 years in prison.

"Glacial bursts, cloudbursts kill 293 in Pakistan; another monsoon spell looms",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/glacial-bursts-cloudbursts-kill-293-in-pakistan-another-monsoon-spell-looms/articleshow/122983132.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: At least 293 people have died and over 600 have been injured across Pakistan since late June as glacial lake outbursts, cloudbursts, and relentless monsoon rains triggered catastrophic floods across the country, from the Himalayas to the southern plains.The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has warned of another severe monsoon spell starting July 29, raising fears of fresh flash floods and landslides, especially in northern regions like Swat, Chitral, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Torrential rains have wreaked havoc across the country, sweeping away entire families, burying homes under landslides, and cutting off remote valleys. A sudden cloudburst near Babusar Top and Naran stranded scores of tourists, prompting military-led rescue operations by air and road. Washed-away bridges and blocked highways have hampered relief efforts.The NDMA, provincial agencies, and army teams are on the ground, but operations remain slow and patchy, especially in the hard-to-reach northern areas. Helicopter sorties continue, though poor weather and visibility are disrupting missions.Experts blame successive govts for ignoring climate adaptation and disaster preparedness, despite warnings. “The pattern is repeating itself — glacial melts, erratic monsoons, unprepared institutions. It’s a deadly mix,” said a disaster risk analyst in Islamabad.The crisis echoes the devastating 2022 monsoon floods, which killed over 1,700, submerged a third of the country, and displaced over 30 million people, causing $30 billion in economic losses. Yet, activists say climate resilience remains absent from Pakistan’s national priorities.With more glaciers than any non-polar country, Pakistan faces an increasing frequency of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) due to rising temperatures. Add to that deforestation, poor drainage, and unregulated construction, and experts say even routine monsoons now turn deadly.As another deluge looms, govt has advised evacuations from high-risk zones and warned tourists to stay away from northern areas. But for many already stranded, the warnings have come too late.","At least 293 people have died and over 600 have been injured across Pakistan since late June.

Three Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants were killed in an encounter with Pakistani security forces in Karachi, officials confirmed on Monday.Among those killed was Zafran, who was identified as the mastermind of a November 2024 attack on two Chinese engineers in Pakistan's largest city. He carried a bounty of Rs 20 million.The operation was conducted late Sunday night in the Manghopir area by the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and intelligence agencies, CTD official Raja Umer Khattab told. The TTP men opened fire when they saw security personnel approaching, triggering a firefight which lasted over an hour.Authorities recovered a suicide jacket, three grenades, a Kalashnikov rifle, two pistols, and a large quantity of ammunition from the site.On November 5 last year, a private security guard opened fire on two Chinese nationals at a textile mill in Karachi, injuring both before fleeing.Pakistan has witnessed a sharp increase in militant attacks—particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan—since the TTP ended its ceasefire with the federal government in late 2022.Founded in 2007, the TTP is an umbrella organisation of various extremist groups seeking to impose a strict version of Islamic law across Pakistan. It has claimed responsibility for numerous high-profile attacks, including the 2008 Marriott Hotel bombing in Islamabad, the 2009 assault on army headquarters, and multiple strikes on security installations.","Three Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants were killed in an encounter with Pakistani security forces in Karachi.

Pakistan tribal council threatens highway block over girl’s murder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-tribal-council-threatens-highway-block-over-girls-murder/articleshow/122939897.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: A tribal jirga (council of elders) in Pakistan’s Tank district has threatened to block a stretch of Indus Highway on July 29 after the killing of a nine-year-old girl sparked public outrage. Convened in Tank’s Gul Imam on Saturday, the jirga issued an 11-point charter of demands, warning of a full blockade if authorities fail to respond.Indus Highway (N-55) is a critical national artery that runs along the river, connecting Karachi in Pakistan’s south with Peshawar in the north and cutting through multiple provinces. The planned blockade at Pezu will impact trade routes, passenger transport, and military convoys.The protests gained momentum after a viral video showed residents confronting armed security personnel -- an extraordinary act in this militarised stretch of southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The footage amplified long-standing anger over arbitrary detentions, raids without warrants, and what locals call collective punishment disguised as counterterrorism.“Our decision to block the highway remains. If our demands are accepted, we’ll reconsider.If not, Pezu will be shut down on July 29,” jirga leader Abdul Qayum Kundi said.Police have registered a case in the girl’s death, but authorities have yet to disclose any findings. Locals allege misconduct or negligence by security forces—claims that remain unverified but widely believed within the community.In a bid to defuse tensions, local officials delivered three sheep and (Pak) Rs 2.5 million (around $9,000) to the girl’s family -- an act rooted in tribal custom, meant to symbolise remorse and reconciliation. But jirga members view it as a token gesture. “This is hush money in ceremonial form,” said one elder.The jirga’s demands include the release of detainees not proven to have militant ties, an end to forced house searches, and a halt to arrests of suspects’ relatives. They also call for the return of confiscated weapons and an end to detentions based on vague accusations of mukhbiri (spying).The jirga’s demands echo those of the banned Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM), which for years challenged Pakistan’s security policies in its tribal belt.","A tribal jirga in Pakistan’s Tank district has threatened to block a stretch of Indus Highway.

‘Reject Pakistani Rule’: BNM Accuses Pakistan of Genocide in Balochistan, Launches Armed Resistance

Poll Do you think that protests and appeals by families of the abducted individuals can lead to change? Yes, they can raise awareness. No, they are largely ineffective.





The crisis of enforced disappearances in Pakistan's Balochistan region and beyond has deepened this week, as a disturbing string of abductions emerges from Karachi, Noshki, and Kech, according to The Balochistan Post (TBP).Among the most alarming cases is that of Muslim Dad Baloch, a fourth-semester philosophy student at the University of Karachi.On Monday evening, he was reportedly abducted near the university's Maskan Gate. Eyewitnesses say he was taken by unidentified men in a vehicle while returning to his hostel with friends.Originally from Mashkay in Awaran district, Muslim Dad was a familiar face within the Baloch student community in Karachi. His sudden disappearance has sparked fear among his peers and left his family devastated.In Noshki, another troubling case unfolded earlier today when Hafeezullah, the son of Peer Mohammad and a resident of Qaziabad, was allegedly picked up from his home by Pakistani security forces. His family has raised alarm over his unknown whereabouts and is demanding his immediate release.TBP also reported two recent disappearances in Kech district.On July 23, 16-year-old shopkeeper Qambar Baloch was allegedly taken by men believed to belong to Military Intelligence and the ISI while he was in Jusak, Turbat. And on June 27, Imran Khan, a 26-year-old student of Balochi language and culture at the University of Turbat, was reportedly abducted by Frontier Corps and Military Intelligence personnel in Turbat city—in broad daylight.“These are not isolated cases. This is a pattern,” said a representative from Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP), a group that has long campaigned for the safe recovery of abducted individuals. Despite repeated appeals and protests, most cases remain unresolved, with no accountability or formal investigations.","Muslim Dad Baloch, a fourth-semester philosophy student at the University of Karachi, was reportedly abducted on Monday.

Pakistan Blames India For Tensions, Credits Trump For Ceasefire Between Nuclear Rivals





Beijing/Islamabad: Pakistan army chief Asim Munir, who is on his first visit to China after his elevation as the field marshal, on Friday held talks with top Chinese leaders and discussed ways to deepen cooperation across all sectors. Munir held separate meetings with V-P Han Zheng, top military official general Zhang Youxia and foreign minister Wang Yi, according to official media reports.This is Munir's first visit to China after India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terrorist infrastructure in Pakistam in response to the Pahalgam terror attack. During the conflict, Pakistan used extensive military equipment supplied by China. This is also Munir's first visit to China after his trip to Washington, where he met US President Trump and sought to establish close ties with America, Beijing's strategic rival.The visit coincides with Pakistan's foreign minister Ishaq Dar making a trip to Washington, where he is expected to meet US secretary of state Marco Rubio. Dar was in China July 14 to attend Shanghai Cooperation Organisation foreign ministers' meeting.A Pakistan military statement said that in their talks, the ""Chinese leadership lauded Pakistan armed forces as a cornerstone of resilience and a vital contributor to peace in South Asia. Both sides expressed satisfaction over the depth of bilateral engagement and reiterated shared commitment to sovereign equality, multilateral cooperation and regional stability.""","Pakistan army chief Asim Munir is on his first visit to China after his elevation as the field marshal.

"Two years on, Imran Khan's sons step in as protest call rattles Islamabad",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/two-years-on-imran-khans-sons-step-in-as-protest-call-rattles-islamabad/articleshow/122911552.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: As jailed former PM Imran Khan completes two years in prison, his sons – Sulaiman and Qasim – have stepped into the political spotlight, launching an aggressive lobbying campaign in the United States to press for their father’s release just days before Khan’s call for a nationwide protest on Aug 5, which has put the state on edge.Khan, arrested on Aug 5, 2023, remains behind bars despite some convictions being overturned. He is currently serving time in three major cases that his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), claims are part of a broader effort to keep him out of politics.He was convicted in the Toshakhana case, involving the illegal sale of state gifts received during his premiership. He was sentenced in the cipher case, accused of leaking classified diplomatic correspondence for political gain. And in the Al-Qadir Trust case, Khan and his wife were held liable for controversial land deals linked to a charitable trust.PTI has consistently maintained that the charges are politically motivated, aimed at “eliminating the most popular leader” in the country.Now, with most of PTI’s senior leadership jailed, exiled, or forced to resign, Khan’s sons have taken the international route. Based in the UK, the brothers have held meetings in Washington DC with US lawmakers, policy groups and human rights organisations, and are reportedly preparing to testify before congressional panels.Their message: Imran Khan is being held in solitary confinement in inhumane conditions, denied light, medical access, and family contact.The campaign has triggered speculation about whether the two sons might return to Pakistan, possibly to appear at the planned protest. While PTI has not confirmed this, party insiders say their presence could act as a powerful morale boost for the party’s dispersed support base.Meanwhile, the state has moved swiftly to neutralise any protest momentum. On July 22, an anti-terror court in Lahore sentenced eight senior PTI leaders, including Dr Yasmin Rashid, to 10 years in prison for their alleged role in the May 9 riots, when military installations were targeted after Khan’s initial arrest. Observers see the convictions as a tactical strike to undercut mobilisation ahead of the Aug 5 protest. The verdicts have raised concerns among legal experts about the selective use of terrorism laws against political opponents.From prison, Khan has issued a call for unity among PTI ranks, urging supporters to “shun differences” and prepare for what he called a decisive moment for Pakistan’s democracy. But the party remains fractured and leaderless, with ongoing rifts between loyalists and factions seen as open to negotiations with the establishment.At the heart of the political storm is the army chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir, who was controversially elevated to five-star rank in May. PTI blames him, along with PML-N and PPP leaders, for orchestrating what it calls a civil-military clampdown to sideline Khan and crush dissent.In a recent prison note, Khan mocked Munir as the “King of the Jungle”, accusing him of ruling the country through “fear, not law”.","Sulaiman and Qasim Khan have launched an aggressive lobbying campaign in the United States to press for their father’s release.
