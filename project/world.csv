SRINAGAR: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) announced Monday the arrest of a Kashmiri college student from Srinagar linked to Delhi suicide bomber Dr Umar Un Nabi, hours after the suspect's father died in hospital of burns suffered in a purported immolation attempt outside their home in Anantnag district's Qazigund.Jasir Bilal Wani, aka Danish, had been detained four days ago for interrogation along with his paternal uncle Nabeel Wani, a physics teacher.The family said Jasir's father Bilal Ahmad Wani, 55, was summoned by police last Saturday and he returned home ""distressed"". The next morning, Bilal walked out of his house in the Wanpora neighbourhood of Qazigund and set himself ablaze, resulting in severe burns. The dry fruits trader died at Srinagar's SMHS Hospital early Monday.NIA issued a statement confirming that Jasir's interrogation over the past few days yielded clues to the Delhi blast, including what the agency said was his ""active involvement"" in the car blast that killed 14 people and wounded over 30 people.""Investigations have revealed that Jasir allegedly provided technical support for terror attacks by modifying drones and attempting to make rockets ahead of the deadly car bomb blast,"" NIA said.""The accused was a co-conspirator who worked closely with the terrorist, Umar Un Nabi, to plan the terror carnage. NIA continues to explore various angles to unravel the conspiracy behind the bombing.""Multiple teams are working on leads and searching for suspects across states ""to identify every person involved in the terror attack"", the agency said.Jasir's arrest was announced a day after NIA took into custody Amir Rashid Ali, a resident of Samboora in Pampore, for conspiring with Nabi. The car used in the explosion was registered in his name.The Wanis are neighbours of Dr Adeel Rather, arrested from UP's Saharanpur on Nov 6 on suspicion of being part of the ""white-collar terror module"".PDP chief and ex-CM Mehbooba Mufti blamed police ""high-handedness"" for Bilal immolating himself. In a post on X, accompanied by a picture of a man with burns across his back, she wrote, ""Petrified about their (Bilal's son and brother) safety he pleaded with the authorities to just see them, which was denied.

HYDERABAD: The bus accident early on Monday in Saudi Arabia left 45 people dead, with only one passenger - Shoeb - surviving the crash.""I spoke to Shoeb. Going by what he said, some passengers were asleep during the crash.

Raid an attempt to 'silence' independent media



NC, PDP on SIA raid at Kashmir Times' office



NEW DELHI: The State Investigation Agency (SIA) of the J&K Police on Thursday raided the Jammu office of the Kashmir Times, alleging that the publication was involved in activities against the country.Officials said the search led to the recovery of AK rifle cartridges, pistol rounds and hand-grenade pins, among other items.According to officials, SIA teams examined the newspaper’s premises and computer systems after registering a case against the publication and its promoters. The promoters are likely to be questioned as the investigation proceeds, PTI reported.The Kashmir Times management sharply criticised the raids, calling the allegations of anti-state activities ""baseless"" and part of a broader attempt to silence ""independent journalism.""Editors Prabodh Jamwal and Anuradha Bhasin, in a joint statement, said, ""The reported raids on our office in Jammu, the baseless accusations of activities inimical to the state and the coordinated crackdown on the Kashmir Times are yet another attempt to silence us.""""Criticising the government is not the same as being inimical to the state. In fact, it is the very opposite. A robust, questioning press is essential to a healthy democracy.Our work of holding power to account, investigating corruption, amplifying marginalised voices strengthens our nation. It does not weaken it,"" they added.The editors alleged that the organisation was being targeted precisely for its independent reporting. ""In an era when critical voices are increasingly scarce, we remain one of the few independent outlets willing to speak truth to power.""They further urged the authorities to withdraw the charges and end the ""harassment,"" appealing to civil society and media colleagues for support.Calling the allegations an intimidation tactic, they said, ""We call on the authorities to immediately cease this harassment, withdraw these unfounded allegations, and respect the constitutional guarantees of press freedom.""They also highlighted the newspaper’s long legacy since its founding in 1954 by Ved Bhasin, saying ""We have chronicled the region’s triumphs and failures with equal rigour. We have given voice to communities that would otherwise go unheard. We have asked difficult questions when others remained silent.""The editors noted that while the paper’s print edition was suspended in 2021–22 due to ""relentless targeting,"" Kashmir Times continues to operate digitally, with all content accessible on its website.Deputy chief minister Surinder Singh Choudhary, reacting to the raid, said action must be based on evidence and not pressure.""The agencies are doing their work. If a raid has to be conducted, it should not be done on a pick-and-choose basis. If they have done anything wrong, action should be taken, but not just to create pressure,"" Surinder Choudhary told reporters.PDP leader Iltija Mufti, daughter of party chief Mehbooba Mufti, said Kashmir Times had consistently resisted attempts to silence it.""Kashmir Times is one of those rare newspapers in Kashmir that not only spoke truth to power but refused to bend or buckle under pressure and intimidation.

SRINAGAR: As reports and videos have emerged of Kashmiris being harassed in other parts of the country in the wake of Delhi car blast, J&K politicians have urged the central govt to intervene and ensure their safety.Former chief minister and PDP president Mehbooba Mufti asked CM Omar Abdullah to take up the issue with the Centre, while Peoples Conference leader Sajad Lone urged PM Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah to “ensure that any citizen of India, including Kashmiris, is not harassed in their own country”.While condemning the Delhi blast, Mehbooba said the doctor involved in the blast not only took his own life and of others, but also made every Kashmiri outside J&K more vulnerable. She was in Kangan in Ganderbal district to offer condolences to the family of Bilal Ahmad Sango, who was injured in the Nov 10 Delhi blast and succumbed during treatment.The PDP chief appealed to the clergy, including Hurriyat Conference chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, to counsel the youth against radicalisation. “Yes, after the abrogation of Article 370, the govt resorted to harassment and large scale arrests, but that should not push our youth toward radicalisation,” she said.She also urged CM Omar to speak to the central govt and end what she called the “collective punishment of Kashmiris”. “We understand the anger over the blast, but that doesn’t mean we should be subjected to collective punishment. Our youth are being profiled and evacuated from colleges and universities. We are going through troubled times, and our young people are now extremely vulnerable,” Mehbooba said.Nasir Khuehami, convenor of Jammu Kashmir Students Association, took to social media and claimed that “Kashmiri shawl sellers in Himachal Pradesh are reportedly facing harassment and profiling, post Delhi blast”. He said several Kashmiri vendors have alleged that local panchayat authorities and individuals are forcibly checking their bags under “unfounded suspicions of carrying weapons or explosives”.Khuehami said Kashmiris are being restricted from moving freely without prior verification from panchayat and local police, creating an atmosphere of fear, insecurity.Peoples Conference leader Sajad Lone also spoke out, saying, “Stereotyping of a Kashmiri, unfortunately, is a favourite hobby across the country; and it is not a new trend. It is just that it has become more chronic in the last decade.”While he accepted that extremism was a problem, Lone said that should not be an excuse to harass an entire community. “There are radical lunatics in every society, but they are an aberration,” he said.","J&K politicians have urged the central govt to intervene and ensure their safety.

""It also faulted the two-judge bench's decision in TN case for prescribing the timeline for the governors and the President and then subjecting their decision to judicial scrutiny on expiry of the timelines when the Constitution clearly prescribes that their decision on Bills are non-justiciable.The five-judge bench said, ""We have no hesitation in concluding that deemed consent of the Governor, or President, under Article 200 or 201 at the expiry of a judicially set timeline, is virtually a takeover, and substitution, of the executive functions by the Judiciary, through judicial pronouncement, which is impermissible within the contours of our written Constitution.""""...

""It is a matter of settled law that jurisdiction under Article 142 cannot be invoked to achieve results that are contrary to the Constitution, or statutory provisions,"" it said.""The concept of 'deemed assent' in the context of Articles 200 and 201 presupposes that one constitutional authority (the SC), could play a 'substitutional role' for another constitutional functionary (the Governor, or President). Such a usurpation of the gubernatorial function of the Governor, and similarly of the President's functions, is antithetical not only to the spirit of the Constitution, but also specifically, the doctrine of separation of powers - which is a part of the basic structure of the Constitution,"" it said, adding that ""A logical corollary of this reasoning is that if there are no prescribed timelines under Articles 200 and 201, then expiry of them too, cannot amount to 'deemed consent'.

NEW DELHI: Police in Gurugram have launched a major investigation after the dismembered body of a young child was discovered along the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) expressway, triggering panic in nearby villages. Officers told PTI the remains were found within the Bilaspur police station limits, and a murder case has been registered.According to police, the torso, head and one leg were recovered, while the right leg and both hands are missing. A senior officer said the condition of the body suggests it is around four days old and appears to belong to a child aged about seven. The child’s face, officers said, was “badly bruised”.The discovery was first reported by Umesh, a resident of Kalwadi village, who said he was walking through nearby fields on Wednesday evening when he came across the mutilated remains in the green belt near Udaypuri village. Police arrived soon after the alert and sent the recovered body parts to the mortuary.With the child still unidentified, police have begun checking records of missing children aged six to seven years, not only in Gurugram but also in neighbouring districts.CCTV footage from cameras installed in the surrounding area is being collected and analysed in an effort to trace the movements of suspects and determine where the killing may have taken place.Assistant Commissioner of Police, Pataudi, Sukhbir Singh said early findings indicate that the child was killed using a sharp-edged weapon. “To hide his identity, his body parts were cut off and thrown at different places. Information about missing children between six to seven years of age is being collected. Several teams have been formed to investigate the case,” he said.","The torso, head and one leg were recovered, while other limbs are missing.

NEW DELHI: Two men suspected of working for an ISI-backed ""terror module"" were injured in an encounter with Ludhiana Police on Thursday after they allegedly opened fire during a police operation. Officers had laid a trap based on intelligence that a Pakistan-based handler had instructed the duo to exchange grenades at specific locations.Ludhiana Police Commissioner Swapan Sharma said the suspects fired at the police when they were intercepted, prompting retaliatory firing. One man was hit by three bullets, and the other by one. Both were taken to a hospital, where one is reported to be in critical condition.Sharma said the module was being run through virtual numbers by an ISI handler based in Pakistan. “They used to receive calls from a virtual number operating from Pakistan; the handler was from Pakistan's ISI...In the encounter today, the Pakistan-based handler had tasked these two individuals to exchange grenades at designated spots,” Sharma was quoted as saying by ANI.Police had earlier arrested three others linked to the same module, Arsh from Bihar’s Bhojpur district, Ajay from Haryana’s Fatehabad, and Shamsher from Ludhiana, each assigned different roles.During the operation, police recovered two Chinese-made grenades, five pistols suspected to have been smuggled across the border, and live ammunition.

Calm And Radical: Dr Umar’s Pre-Blast Video Exposes Educated New Face Of Terror Behind Delhi Attack

NEW DELHI: Authorities in Jammu and Kashmir intensified searches across hospitals and media offices on Thursday as part of the widening investigation into the Delhi blast, with police focusing on possible links between medical staff, extremist modules, and networks connected to fugitive operatives.The scrutiny, officials told PTI, stems from the recovery of arms, ammunition and nearly 3,000 kg of explosive material in the “white-collar” terror module that first came to light in south Kashmir earlier this month.In Srinagar and Anantnag, police teams, accompanied by medical officers, inspected lockers used by doctors and other hospital staff in district hospitals, private facilities, medical colleges and health centres.Officers said the drive was aimed at preventing misuse of storage spaces for illegal or hazardous material and ensuring that hospital infrastructure was not being exploited for activities that could compromise security. Every rack and locker was examined, and staff were reminded that lockers must be used strictly for official purposes.Officials said these checks will now be part of routine vigilance across health institutions.The operation followed the discovery of an AK-47 rifle in the locker of Dr Adeel Rather at the Government Medical College in Anantnag earlier this month. His arrest led to the unravelling of a larger terror network involving several doctors. During Thursday’s inspection at GMC Anantnag, police and hospital administrators identified unclaimed lockers and directed that records be updated to prevent further misuse.Parallel to the hospital searches, the State Investigation Agency raided the Jammu head office of Kashmir Times and the residence of owner Prabodh Jamwal. The agency said arms, ammunition and incriminating documents were seized during the raids. According to investigators, the publication is accused of promoting anti-national activities and running content that allegedly propagated secessionist narratives. Items recovered during the search included a revolver, empty AK-series cases, live rounds, fired bullets, grenade safety levers and suspected pistol ammunition. These will undergo forensic and technical analysis as part of the ongoing inquiry.Meanwhile, the Delhi Police Special Cell identified a new link in the Red Fort car blast investigation, connecting the case to fugitive Indian Mujahideen operative Mirza Shadab Baig. Baig, wanted for the 2008 blasts in Rajasthan and Gujarat, studied at Al-Falah—an institution already under scrutiny after the “suicide bomber” involved in the Delhi attack was found to be a professor there. Multiple agencies are now examining networks tied to the university, which is facing separate cases for alleged financial irregularities and forgery, alongside searches by the Enforcement Directorate earlier this week.","Authorities in Jammu and Kashmir intensified searches across hospitals and media offices on Thursday.

Candace Owens Makes Shocking Egyptian Planes Claim In Charlie Kirk Case

Candace Owens says flight signals, rental cars, and timing raise new questions

Operation Mocking-Plane: The Charlie Kirk Plot Thickens. | Candace Ep 266





Candace Owens says she has many serious questions about the killing of Charlie Kirk. She talked about this again in her podcast on November 17. She said she found new details that made her even more worried. Candace Owens said two Egyptian planes showed up many times near Erika Kirk, Charlie Kirk’s wife. She said these planes showed up at places where Erika Kirk was 73 times from 2022 to September 2025. She said she found these numbers after checking the work of a woman online, whom she called a “pregnant mommy sleuth.”She said the woman was right. Candace Owens said 29 of those overlaps also had Charlie Kirk in the same place. She said both planes were also at the Provo airport on September 10, the day Charlie Kirk was shot near Utah Valley University. She said one plane took off, and the other stayed on the ground with its power on.Candace Owens said the two planes were the yellow SU-BTT and the blue SU-BND. She said these flights mostly matched Erika Kirk’s movements inside five U.S. states but also matched her travel overseas. She said one plane at the Provo airport sent out a signal from 9:05 a.m.until 10:34 a.m. on September 10. She said its signal turned on again 17 minutes after Charlie Kirk was shot at 12:40 p.m., and stayed on until 1:29 p.m.Candace Owens said she believed this signal came from data on ADS-B Exchange. She also said the flight was “transponding” at Duncan Aviation. She said she saw claims online from MJTruthUltra that Duncan Aviation gave rental cars to people linked to the Egyptian planes. She even read out the car details and asked if anyone had seen them.Candace Owens said the plane could have been doing normal maintenance. She also said the plane might have tools to make private satellite calls. She said these ideas were only her guesses of her about the situation.Also Read: Candace Owens sparks chaos with new Britney Spears trafficking claim as Lou Taylor link trends after Kim Kardashian video Candace Owens said Turning Point USA knew about these flights and should explain why the planes were there.

"Before The Docs, An Al-Falah Engineer Chose Path Of Terror",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/before-the-docs-an-al-falah-engineer-chose-path-of-terror/articleshow/125469900.cms,"New Delhi: On a chilly winter night in 2005, Mirza Shadab Baig, an engineering graduate, moved into a dingy room in southeast Delhi's Zakir Nagar. The next two years witnessed the formation of what was called the notorious ‘Azamgarh module' of Indian Mujahideen (IM) and the transformation of Baig into a notorious and radical jihadi.His ruthlessness can be gauged from the fact that during the Delhi serial blasts in 2008, he is said to have specifically targeted a children's park near India Gate. While bombs exploded at Karol Bagh, Connaught Place and Greater Kailash, the one planted by Baig at the park was detected in time and defused.Now presumed to be somewhere along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, Baig's name has cropped up with his alma mater, Al-Falah University, in the spotlight in connection with the Nov 10 explosion near Red Fort.Baig, an accused in multiple blasts in India between 2007 and 2011, got his bachelor's degree in engineering from the Faridabad university in 2007, investigators looking into last week's blast, said on Thursday.The son of a doctor from Azamgarh, Baig initially worked with HCL Infosystems in Noida. However, along with Asadullah Akhtar and Ariz Khan, his classmates from Jyoti Niketan school in Azamgarh, Baig eventually chose the path of terror after being radicalised.Once Baig moved to Zakir Nagar, he met Atif Ameen of Batla House infamy, who lived in nearby Shaheen Bagh. A police charge sheet details how this meeting changed the course of life of not only Baig, but also Akhtar and Khan. Ameen made them listen to speeches of Jaish-e-Muhammed founder Maulana Masood Azhar, showed them clips of the Palestine conflict and gave them magazines on related topics.Later, Ameen and Baig founded the Azamgarh/Sanjarpur modules of IM that carried out multiple blasts across the country. On Nov 23, 2007, the outfit planted IEDs on court premises in Varanasi, Faizabad and Lucknow. It sent an email to news channels five minutes prior to the blasts to claim responsibility — the first time IM owned up to a terror attack.Baig, like the Nov 10 bomber, Umar Un Nabi — a doctor who, too, was associated with Al-Falah — wanted to carry out blasts on a massive scale. ""Ab pattern change karna hoga,"" read a message on Akhtar, aka Hadi's mobile phone, which was retrieved by the special cell of Delhi Police. The sender was Baig, who wanted to engineer a 26/11-type attack or at least reach its scale in terms of casualties and destruction. Years later, Umar actually changed the pattern, carrying out the first suicide car bombing in the capital, which killed 15 people.Shortly after the Batla House encounter in Jamia Nagar in 2008 in which Ameen and another terrorist was killed, Baig fled the country and went to Pakistan. He and a few others like Dr Shehnawaj and Shafi Armar flirted with what was called Islamic State in Khorasan Province (ISKP) before forming Ansar-ud Tawhid, another outfit. Pakistan's ISI continues to be their primary recruiter.","Mirza Shadab Baig, an engineering graduate, moved into a dingy room in southeast Delhi's Zakir Nagar in 2005.

BHOPAL: A Class 11 student died by suicide in Rewa after allegedly facing sustained harassment from a schoolteacher, according to a handwritten note recovered from her room. Police on Thursday seized the girl’s mobile phone and the suicide note, which contains detailed accusations describing the teacher’s alleged conduct in the classroom.In the note, the girl wrote that the teacher would grab her hand under the guise of punishing her, clench his fist and challenge her to open it, or press a pen between her fingers with force. “Whenever the teacher beat me… he would grab my hand. He would hold my hand over the bench and say, ‘Look how cold my hand is.’ What is all this?” she wrote.The girl’s grandfather and father told police that she had no issues at home. They alleged that the pressure and humiliation she faced at school pushed her toward the extreme step.During questioning, the girl’s elder sister named a minor boy from her class with whom the deceased used to speak. However, police said preliminary probe shows no evidence linking the boy to the suicide, calling their interactions “normal friendship.”","A Class 11 student died by suicide in Rewa after allegedly facing sustained harassment from a schoolteacher.

Delhi Student Suicide Case: Massive Protest Outside School After Note Alleges Harassment By Teachers

NEW DELHI: What should have been a routine school morning turned tragic for 16-year-old Shourya Patil's family. He had refused to perform a dance because of a sprained ankle — but warning from his teachers that morning pushed him to the brink.Shourya left the school through the back gate and never reached his designated pick-up point. “The next we heard was that he had jumped from the metro station,"" said a relative.A handwritten suicide note recovered from Shourya’s school bag blamed the teachers for his death.In it, he wrote, “The school staff said so much that I had to do it… My last wish is that action be taken against them so that no other student does what I did. I am sorry, but the teachers did this to me.”He also expressed apologies to his family and requested that his organs be donated to those in need.The suicide note found in also mentioned the names of the teachers who allegedly humiliated him. ""My last wish is that action is taken against them, I don't want any other child to do something like me (sic),"" it said.Following the incident, the Delhi police registered an FIR against four teachers, who have been suspended.The suspension order instructed them to stay available for official communication and barred them from visiting the school or interacting with students, staff, or parents without written permission.A police team visited the school to speak with students and also retrieved CCTV footage connected to the incident. ""We have gathered information on the teachers mentioned in the FIR and will be issuing summonses for them to appear in the investigation,"" an officer said.A friend of Shourya said, ""He had faced issues for a long time. This wasn’t the first incident; many students had complained that St. Columbus School wasn’t good, and the teachers spoke harshly.""Shaurya wanted to be a dancer and was very involved in the drama club to build his portfolio. But the drama teacher used to push and insult him, saying he was ‘overacting’ and shouldn’t act so much,"" she added further.","Shourya Patil, 16, left the school through the back gate and never reached his designated pick-up point.

'No Talent In U.S.': Trump BURNS MAGA Base For India Reset? What It Means For Indian Workers





Nikki Haley’s son stirred a row after saying naturalised citizens in the United States should not be allowed to hold public office. His comments come at a time when he is already under fire for calling for a complete ban on H-1B visas.The 24-year-old Indian-origin said in an interview that growing up in America is the “biggest part of understanding” the country and argued that only those born in the US should be eligible for elected positions. The comments were made during a conversation with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson, who himself has been facing attacks from Democrats accusing him of working for Israel and promoting an extreme right agenda.Nalin had already caused a stir earlier this month when he told Fox News that the H-1B programme disadvantages Americans entering the job market. “We are seeing kids graduate with six figures in debt and not having a job to show for it,” he said. “My main friend group graduated with great degrees from great schools. It's been a year and a half since graduation. Not one of them has a job.”He claimed that the presence of foreign workers has worsened the situation, and in his interview with Carlson said that the US should stop giving university admission to immigrants, adding that ‘America First’ is the only motto people should follow.He also alleged that some of the students are ""spies"" from other countries and the government should limit the influx of foreigners.The elite youngster defended his hardline position despite criticism from Democrats and the Indian-American community. “I mean, they shouldn't be [surprised] because I've seen how it's affected my friends and those around me. At the end of the day, my loyalty is to America,” he said.He doubled down on his position, saying, “We need to get rid of the foreign worker visas. We need to ban H-1B visas. And we need to punish companies that are not putting American workers first.”Moreover, Nalin’s comments come at a time when the H-1B issue is already highly sensitive, with Trump himself softening his stance by saying the US lacks talent and needs skilled foreign workers to fill positions in areas such as tech and defence. The MAGA base is currently split, with one side supporting Nalin’s “America First, America only” view, including figures like Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, while other conservatives argue that the US is in urgent need of foreign workers and cannot afford to end the H-1B programme for the sake of the country's economy.Nalin is the son of Nikki Haley, who is a former US Ambassador to the UN and former governor of South Carolina.",Nikki Haley's son says naturalised citizens should not be allowed to hold public office. 24-year-old Indian-origin said growing up in America is the ‘biggest part of understanding’ the country.

'Regime Changes In Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal Building Cases Of Bad Governance': NSA Ajit Doval





Gen Z demonstrators returned to the streets of Nepal’s Bara district on Thursday, reigniting tensions for a second straight day as clashes with police broke out early in the morning.With unrest intensifying in Simara, local authorities imposed a curfew from 1.00 pm to 8.00 pm (local time) in an effort to contain the situation after Wednesday’s confrontation between the youths and CPN-UML cadres.""Curfew has been reimposed following the clash with the police to bring the situation under control,"" assistant chief district officer Chhabiraman Subedi was quoted as saying by ANI.Tensions in Bara have been escalating since Wednesday, after UML (Unified Marxist Leninist) leaders prepared to visit the district ahead of the March 5, 2026 elections. The unrest has raised concerns among experts, who point to the fragile security situation, with hundreds of inmates still at large and a comparable number of weapons missing following the September uprising.The situation intensified when Gen Z supporters were injured in a confrontation at Simara Chowk near the airport, prompting the group to file a complaint against six UML cadres.Gen Z leader Samrat Upadhyay, 21, a resident of Simara in Bara, said that a group of 10–12 youths had gathered peacefully when CPN-UML cadres allegedly attacked them, leaving seven injured, including himself.""Thus, our demand is simple – arrest Mahesh Basnet and UML cadres who launched a brutal attack on us today, injuring at least seven of us. Bara will remain close until our demands are met,"" Upadhyay was quoted as saying by The Himalayan Times.Police later detained Ward Chair Dhan Bahadur Shrestha of Ward 2 and Ward Chair Kaimudin Ansari of Ward 6 of Jeetpursimara Sub-metropolitan City in connection with the earlier clashes.As violence escalated near Simara Airport, police fired tear gas to disperse protestors, leading authorities to temporarily suspend airport operations.The agitated Gen Z protesters have accused the police of failing to apprehend those named in their complaint related to Wednesday’s clash. Sushila Karki , the former chief justice now serving as interim prime minister following the September uprising, urged all political actors to “refrain from unwanted political provocation” and place their trust in the democratic process ahead of the March 5, 2026 elections.In a statement issued late Wednesday, Karki said, “I have directed the Home Administration and security agencies to work with utmost restraint and preparation to maintain peace and order.”She added that her priority is to “ensure the safe movement of leaders of all political parties, and create a fair and fear-free environment for the elections.”Nepal remains in a fragile political transition following the September regime change, when nationwide protests forced then–prime minister and UML chairman KP Oli to resign.The two-day uprising left 76 people dead across the country. What began as anger over a government-imposed social media ban quickly expanded into a wider revolt driven by years of economic stagnation and entrenched corruption in the nation of 30 million.Demonstrators torched parliament, courts and government offices, ultimately toppling the 73-year-old four-time premier. Karki, also 73, was appointed interim prime minister to guide the country toward fresh elections.","Gen Z demonstrators returned to the streets of Nepal’s Bara district on Thursday, reigniting tensions for a second straight day.

"‘To advance US energy dominance’: Trump admin unveils offshore drilling plan; California, Florida waters targeted",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/to-advance-us-energy-dominance-trump-admin-unveils-offshore-drilling-plan-california-florida-waters-targeted/articleshow/125475431.cms,"Image source: X/@SecretaryBurgum



The Donald Trump administration on Thursday unveiled a sweeping offshore oil and gas leasing proposal that would open waters off California, Florida and Alaska to new drilling, reversing restrictions imposed during former US President Joe Biden’s presidency. The draft schedule, detailed in a new Interior Department plan, was described by Politico as the most expansive federal offshore leasing push in decades.The Department of the Interior issued a new Secretary’s Order directing the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to end the Biden administration’s 2024–2029 National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Programme and replace it with a far broader 2026–2031 plan. According to BOEM, the draft proposal includes up to 34 potential offshore lease sales across 1.27 billion acres, covering 21 areas off Alaska, seven in the Gulf of Mexico and six along the Pacific coast.“Offshore oil and gas production does not happen overnight. It takes years of planning, investment, and hard work before barrels reach the market,” Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said. “The Biden administration slammed the brakes on offshore oil and gas leasing and crippled the long-term pipeline of America’s offshore production.By moving forward with a robust, forward-thinking leasing plan, we are ensuring that America’s offshore industry stays strong, workers stay employed, and the nation remains energy dominant for decades to come. ”The proposal would open areas that have not seen drilling in decades or have never been developed. The administration argues the expansion is necessary to meet the nation’s “growing energy needs.” It replaces a Biden-era programme that includes only three scheduled sales between 2024 and 2029. Politico reported that the new plan includes lease sales off the California coast, the eastern Gulf of Mexico and Arctic waters off Alaska, including previously untouched parts of the High Arctic.The announcement triggered immediate political resistance. California Governor Gavin Newsom called the plan “dead on arrival,” according to Axios, with state officials warning of threats to ecosystems, tourism and fisheries. The Washington Post noted that Florida has long opposed drilling near its shoreline and that the Deepwater Horizon disaster had a lasting impact on the state, leading lawmakers to resist similar proposals during Trump’s first term.The Washington Post also reported that California officials pointed to the legacy of the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill and argued there is no national need for expanded drilling. They added that the region lacks the infrastructure to support a major offshore push and that state regulators would oppose new terminals and pipelines.Environmental groups also criticised the proposal. “The people of these states have been clear that they don’t want this off their coasts,” a Natural Resources Defense Council official said, as quoted by Axios.According to the Washington Post, more than 100 members of Congress have urged the administration to drop the plan, warning of environmental and economic risks.","The Donald Trump administration on Thursday unveiled a sweeping offshore oil and gas leasing proposal.

‘THIS IS VIOLENCE’: Global Backlash As Brazil Opens Amazon To Oil Drilling On COP30 Eve





A fire broke out at the COP30 climate summit in Belem, Brazil, on Thursday, forcing thousands of delegates to evacuate and halting negotiations at a critical moment in the two-week conference.Ironically, the blaze appears to have been caused by electrical equipment, likely a microwave — showing that even a summit dedicated to climate action doesn’t always follow its own rules.The blaze began around 2.00 pm (1700 GMT) in an exhibition pavilion. Security footage later showed flames racing up an internal fabric shell lining the walls and ceiling, burning a hole through the roof as smoke filled the corridors and people ran for the exits shouting “fire!”Firefighters said the incident was brought under control within six minutes. Nineteen people were treated for smoke inhalation and two for anxiety, according to the Brazilian presidency of the event.Firefighters and ambulances arrived with sirens blaring as smoke rose from the tents and permanent buildings hosting diplomats, journalists, and activists. The affected area was sealed off with a large sheet, and delegates were escorted in one by one to retrieve belongings, including passports needed for evening flights.Plenary sessions will not resume until Friday.It was the third major incident since the summit began last week, following peaceful demonstrations by Indigenous protesters who first stormed the venue and later blockaded the entrance. COP30 hosts Brazil and United Nations Climate Change said in a joint statement that security responded “swiftly” and the blaze was controlled quickly.After a fire department inspection, Brazil declared the site reopened at 8.40 pm.The disruption hit at a delicate stage in the negotiations, with ministers struggling to break a deadlock over fossil fuels, climate finance, and trade measures. Delegates remain divided over Brazil’s proposed “roadmap” to transition away from fossil fuels, as well as concerns about weak emissions-reduction plans and funding for developing nations.Earlier in the day, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned negotiators that “the world is watching” and urged them to reach an “ambitious compromise.” He also welcomed calls for clarity on the disputed issue of weaning the world off fossil fuels.With less than 24 hours before the summit’s scheduled end, nearly 200 countries are still working to reach consensus. Brazil has described securing a final deal as vital to accelerating global climate action and turning years of promises into meaningful progress.","A fire broke out at the COP30 climate summit in Belem, Brazil, on Thursday, forcing thousands of delegates to evacuate.

Candace Owens links Erika Kirk to Egyptian planes in new claim





Candace Owens shared new doubts after the death of Charlie Kirk . She said she has not seen any proof that Erika Kirk, Charlie’s wife, has lied about anything. Owens spoke about this on Myron Gaines’ podcast. She said the day before Charlie Kirk was killed, he had sent a message to a person at Turning Point USA about a death threat. Candace Owens said this message made her worry even more about what happened inside the group. She also said some people at Turning Point USA were ready to make Mikey McCoy the “new Charlie,” which she found strange right after Charlie’s death.Candace Owens said Erika Kirk may look quiet or cold to some people online, but she believes this can happen when someone is in shock. She said Erika may be on “autopilot” because she is scared. Owens added that anyone would feel fear after seeing someone close get killed. She also said she has not found anything bad about Erika Kirk in her own checks. After this interview, Ben Shapiro and Steven Crowder said Owens was trying to attack Erika Kirk. Owens pushed back. She said Shapiro lied when he claimed she accused Erika of murder. She said this was made up and not true.Candace Owens also shared a new theory about two Egyptian military planes. She said these planes crossed paths with Erika Kirk’s travel records 73 times from 2022 to 2025. She said one plane was at the Provo Airport on the day Charlie Kirk was shot. Owens said a person helping her check flight paths spent many hours looking at the records and believed the planes were following Erika, not Charlie.Candacw Owens said she later checked more files and found even more overlap between Erika Kirk’s travel and the two planes. She said this made her believe that something larger may be happening around the couple. She added these overlaps happened long before Charlie was killed.On the podcast, Candace Owens also questioned the story of the shooter. Police named Tyler Robinson as the person who shot Charlie. Owens said she believes he may be a “patsy.” She claimed more people may have touched the gun and said the full truth has not come out yet.Owens ended by saying she is not blaming Erika Kirk at all. She said her main concern is the group around Charlie Kirk and the strange events linked to the planes and the shooting. She said the case still feels unclear and more answers are needed.Also Read: Candace Owens drops explosive claim on Charlie Kirk's assassination with shocking twist about Tyler Robinson fingerprints","Candace Owens shared new doubts after the death of Charlie Kirk.

US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine planned to held a closed-door meeting with Nigeria’s National security adviser Mallam Nuhu Ribadu at the Pentagon on Thursday evening, amid tensions sparked by President Donald Trump ’s threat to send American troops into Nigeria, ABC news reported.This follows Trump’s warning earlier this month that the US could launch swift military action if Nigeria failed to curb attacks on Christians.Trump’s post on his social media platform directed the Pentagon to prepare for potential operations saying “If the Nigerian Government continues to allow the killing of Christians, the USA will immediately stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria, and may very well go into that now disgraced country, ‘guns-a-blazing,’ to completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities,” Trump posted on social media. “I am hereby instructing our Department of War to prepare for possible action. If we attack, it will be fast, vicious, and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians!”, a message to which Hegseth publicly replied, “Yes sir” adding “the Department of War is preparing for action.""Independent conflict-monitoring organisations say tens of thousands of civilians have been killed in Nigeria in recent years in violence affecting both Christians and Muslims, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project.Nigeria has rejected Washington’s decision to re-designate it as a “Country of Particular Concern” over alleged religious-freedom violations, with President Bola Ahmed Tinubu saying the characterisation “does not reflect our national reality. ”Deploying US ground troops to Nigeria would pose major logistical and political hurdles, given the country’s vast terrain, porous borders and expected public resistance. The US has around 6,500 military personnel across Africa, but no permanent troop presence in Nigeria. Drone operations in the region have also become harder after the US was forced to vacate key counterterrorism bases in neighbouring Niger following a military coup, officials earlier noted.A senior State Department official told CNN the 'high-level' Nigerian delegation’s visit had created an opening for “frank conversations,” adding that Washington wanted to help make Nigeria safer “for religious communities of all stripes.”US lawmakers have also pressed Abuja for demonstrable action. Rep. Riley Moore said he had conveyed that the US expected “tangible steps” to prevent violence against Christian communities.Sources cited by CNN said Nigeria had shown a greater willingness to work with the US military following Trump’s warning, with US Africa Command prepared to deepen cooperation if requested.With meetings underway both at the Pentagon and Capitol Hill, officials on both sides signalled an urgent effort to prevent the dispute from spiralling into a full-blown crisis.The meeting, confirmed by two defence officials, did not feature on the public schedules of either Hegseth or Caine, and Mallam Nuhu Ribadu’s visit to the Pentagon was kept closed to the press.",US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen.

The venue hosting the COP30 UN climate talks in Belem has reopened after a fire forced an evacuation earlier in the day, Brazilian officials said Thursday night. In a statement, authorities said they had “restored operating conditions at the conference venue,” and confirmed that negotiations will resume on Friday, AFP reported.This follows after a fire ripped through several pavilions at the COP30 climate summit in Belem on Thursday, triggering evacuations and stalling negotiations just as delegates entered a decisive phase.The blaze, which tore through the roof of a temporary structure at the entrance to the venue, sent thousands of attendees fleeing as smoke rapidly filled enclosed corridors, according to AFP.Organisers said the fire was extinguished within six minutes, but 13 people were treated for smoke inhalation and the entire site was shut down until late evening, reported the Associated Press. The incident occurred on the penultimate day of the conference, where nearly 200 nations are attempting to resolve disputes over fossil-fuel transition, climate finance and trade-linked measures.Around 4.20 pm, the COP30 presidency said the blaze had been brought under control “with limited damage,” but confirmed that delegates would not be allowed back into the negotiation halls until later Thursday evening, reported The New York Times.Early accounts suggested the blaze started near the Africa pavilion, The New York Times reported.

President Donald Trump on Thursday called six Democratic lawmakers as “traitors” and called for them to face execution after they released a video telling members of the US military they have a duty to refuse illegal orders.Trump reposted an article about the video on Truth Social, adding: “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”Earlier, he wrote: “This is really bad, and Dangerous to our Country. Their words cannot be allowed to stand. SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR FROM TRAITORS!!! LOCK THEM UP???”The video was released on Tuesday and featured Senators Elissa Slotkin and Mark Kelly, both former military personnel, and Representatives Jason Crow, Maggie Goodlander, Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan. They warned service members and intelligence officials that the Trump administration was putting institutions at risk and undermining the Constitution. “We know you are under enormous stress and pressure right now,” said Kelly. “Our laws are clear: You can refuse illegal orders.” Slotkin concluded: “We need you to stand up for our laws, our Constitution. Don't give up the ship.”Following Trump’s posts, Slotkin wrote on X that she and her colleagues would continue to defend the Constitution.“No threat, intimidation, or call for violence will deter us from that sacred obligation,” she said.Top Democrats condemned Trump’s remarks as a direct threat and a potential incitement to violence, reports news agency Reuters. Senator Chris Coons said: “Calling for the execution of senators and members of Congress for reminding our troops of that is chilling behavior we should expect from authoritarians ... not the president of the United States. Every one of my Republican colleagues needs to stand up and swiftly condemn this. ”Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer added: “When Donald Trump uses the language of execution and treason, some of his supporters may very well listen. He is lighting a match soaked with gasoline.”Under US law, civilians cannot be charged with sedition, though “seditious conspiracy” carries a maximum penalty of 20 years. For military personnel, the Uniform Code of Military Justice includes sedition charges that can carry the death penalty.","Six Democratic lawmakers released a video telling members of the US military they have a duty to refuse illegal orders.

‘Desperate’ For Saudi-Israel Ties, Trump 'IGNORES' Pentagon's China Threat; Okays 48 F-35 Jets Deal





US President Donald Trump said on Monday that his administration would move ahead with the long-anticipated sale of F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia, despite internal concerns that the deal could expose sensitive American technology to China.When asked whether he would approve the sale, Trump said, “I will say that we will be doing that. We’ll be selling F-35s.”The announcement came a day before Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s expected arrival in Washington, his first US visit in over seven years. The F-35 deal is among several major agreements the two countries are likely to unveil during the visit, according to AP.The crown prince is expected to seek formal US assurances on military protection for the kingdom and the purchase of the F-35, one of the world’s most advanced fighter jets.The timing of the announcement also reflects Trump’s push to secure a normalisation deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel. He has promoted an expansion of the Abraham Accords as key to long-term regional stability while the fragile Gaza ceasefire holds. “I hope that Saudi Arabia will be going into the Abraham Accords very shortly,” he told reporters on Air Force One on Friday.However, Saudi Arabia has maintained that any deal must include a guaranteed pathway to a Palestinian state, a position Israel firmly rejects.Officials say Riyadh is unlikely to join the accords immediately, though there is guarded optimism about a possible agreement by the end of Trump’s second term.The New York Times reported that a Pentagon intelligence assessment raised fresh concerns that China could gain access to sensitive F-35 technology if the sale proceeds. Sources familiar with the Defence Intelligence Agency’s findings said US officials fear potential Chinese espionage and Beijing’s growing security cooperation with Riyadh. Washington has also been evaluating whether the sale would affect Israel’s qualitative military edge, given Israel is the only Middle Eastern country operating F-35s and has used them in strikes in Iran in October 2024 and June 2025.Bradley Bowman of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies said Congress may now seek clarity on what assurances Riyadh has offered regarding its ties with China. He added that lawmakers are likely to press the administration on how it plans to maintain Israel’s military advantage in the region.",US President Donald Trump said on Monday that his administration would move ahead with the long-anticipated sale of F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia.

Trump 'knew about the underage girls'?











Mark Epstein, the brother of the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein , has tried to shut down a viral rumour about the newly released Epstein emails. He said that the name “Bubba” mentioned in a 2018 exchange between the brothers was not a reference to former President Bill Clinton.The clarification came after a March 2018 email between Jeffrey and Mark Epstein was released this week by Democrats, which stirred a row. In the message, Mark asked Jeffrey, who had said he was with Steve Bannon, to “ask him if Putin has the photos of Trump b*****g Bubba.” Because Clinton was long known by the nickname “Bubba”, the reference was speculated by many as Trump having oral intercourse with Clinton.Mark Epstein pushed back in a statement to The Advocate, saying the message was being misread. “They were simply part of a humorous private exchange between two brothers and were never meant for public release or to be interpreted as serious remarks,” he wrote. He added, “For the avoidance of doubt, the reference to ‘Bubba’ in this correspondence is not, in any way, a reference to former President Bill Clinton.”Mark's spokesperson, Ali Clark, said in an email that Bubba is “a private individual who is not a public figure.”Mark said that attaching political motives to a nickname distracts from “the serious questions that remain unanswered.”The wider set of emails points to far more serious claims about Jeffrey Epstein’s political ties with the MAGA chief. In a 2019 message to author Michael Wolff, Epstein wrote that Trump “knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine to stop.” Another email from 2011, sent to Ghislaine Maxwell, claimed that Trump spent hours at Epstein’s home with one of his sex-trafficking victims.California Representative Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said the documents raise “serious new questions” about Trump’s ties to Epstein and accused the Justice Department of obstructing the inquiry. “There’s a massive cover-up at the White House and the DOJ right now over the files.”The White House has dismissed the emails, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt rejecting any suggestion of Trump being involved in the Epstein scandal.Meanwhile, Trump also claimed that Bill Clinton spent significant time on Epstein’s island and threatened to launch an FBI and DOJ probe into various high-profile figures, including JPMorgan and Chase.The row intensified on Friday when Trump launched a Truth Social rant attacking Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene after she backed a bipartisan move to force the release of all unclassified Epstein files.","Mark Epstein, the brother of the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, has tried to shut down a viral rumour about the newly released Epstein emails.

On Cam: Dem Lawmaker’s ‘Texts’ With Epstein Inside U.S. Cong Sparks Fury; Explosive Plaskett Link





Former Harvard University president and US treasury secretary Larry Summers has said he will step back from several public roles following the release of documents detailing years of personal correspondence with convicted sex offender and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.In a statement issued by him on Monday night, quoted by The Washington Post, Summers said he was “deeply ashamed” of maintaining contact with Epstein and accepted full responsibility for what he called a “misguided” decision. He said he would continue his teaching duties but would retreat from other commitments as part of an effort to rebuild trust and mend ties with people close to him.“I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused,” Summers said. “I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein. While continuing to fulfill my teaching obligations, I will be stepping back from public commitments as one part of my broader effort to rebuild trust and repair relationships with the people closest to me”, he added.His announcement comes in the wake of the House Oversight Committee’s release of a fresh set of documents detailing Epstein’s extensive interactions with political leaders, influential figures and long-time associates.While much public attention focused on Epstein’s comments about Donald Trump, the material also shed light on his communications with Summers.According to a report by The Guardian, emails exchanged between the two from 2013 to early 2019 show Epstein and Summers discussing politics, personal matters and Summers’s own relationships. In several of the exchanges, Epstein offered advice on Summers’s attempts to pursue a woman. The final messages were sent only months before Epstein’s arrest.The Centre for American Progress said Summers was no longer a fellow and confirmed that the planned launch of an economic working group he was to help lead had been put on hold as Summers continued to remain under public scrutiny. The Yale Budget Lab said he had withdrawn from its advisory group. Other organisations with which he is affiliated, including economic think tanks, did not immediately issue public comments.Summers, who served as Harvard University president from 2001 to 2006 and continues as a professor, faced renewed calls for the university to distance itself. Senator Elizabeth Warren, herself an emerita Harvard professor, told CNN that the institution should sever ties. Harvard did not respond to requests for comment.Epstein donated more than $9 million to Harvard and its affiliated programmes between 1998 and 2008 and briefly held a visiting fellowship that the university later found he was unqualified for.Summers has previously acknowledged regretting his dealings with Epstein. The release of the latest documents has revived scrutiny over the depth and duration of their relationship.","Larry Summers has said he will step back from several public roles following the release of documents detailing years of personal correspondence with disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.

.

.





Deposed Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina was Monday sentenced to death in absentia for the violent 2024 student crackdown by a special tribunal in a verdict that she described as a foregone conclusion. Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus hailed the verdict saying no one is above the law.Hasina had called the tribunal a kangaroo court and, as she told ToI before the verdict, one that was controlled by her political adversaries looking to deflect attention from their governance failures.India responded to Hasina’s sentencing with caution as it said in a statement that it had taken note of the verdict by the ""International Crimes Tribunal of Bangladesh” and, as a close neighbour, remained committed to the best interests of the people of Bangladesh, including in peace, democracy, inclusion and stability in that country.“We will always engage constructively with all stakeholders to that end,’’ said the external affairs ministry in a statement, giving nothing away on Dhaka’s renewal of its demand immediately after the sentencing for the extradition of the deposed PM who remains in India.The government has so far only acknowledged the interim government’s call for her extradition, while remaining non-committal on what it proposes to do about it.That has been its position since December last year, when Dhaka officially sought her extradition, and it’s unlikely to comply with any such request in haste now as Hasina’s dramatic death sentencing does little to change the situation on the ground as far as India is concerned.The 2013 extradition treaty with Dhaka in any case may provide immunity to Hasina from any political witch hunt. Article 6 of the treaty states that extradition can be refused if the offence for which it is requested is of a political character. While Dhaka will argue that the same article excludes murder from the list of such offences, Article 8 also states that a person may not be extradited if he can convince the requested state that the accusations against him were not made in good faith “in the interests of justice”.In short, extradition would be a complex and long-drawn-out process and, for India, entail both legal commitments and geopolitical considerations. The sentencing will likely only add another layer of complexity to Hasina’s case. As an aspiring great power, India would not like to be seen as giving up on a longtime ally who remained attuned to India’s economic and security interests, not least by keeping in check radical Islamists. Abandoning Hasina would also not just demoralise Hasina’s party Awami League, which is facing a ban from participating in the upcoming elections, but also energize radical anti-India forces.The unelected interim government has also done little to assuage India’s concerns about increasing radicalisation and safety and security of minority communities. India also knows that Dhaka’s ongoing efforts to revive the relationship with Pakistan can act as real conundrum for India soon, even as it engages the interim government by hosting the Bangladesh NSA for a security conclave this week.More than the fate of Hasina perhaps, India will be concerned about what the verdict might mean for Awami League as it seeks free, fair and inclusive polls in the country. Hasina told ToI last week that the ban came from an unelected cadre that seized power and now wanted to take its political opponents out of the game.“It was the Awami League that introduced key reforms to ensure transparency and fairness, including- the use of photo-based voter lists, see-through ballot boxes, and the establishment of an independent election commission. There is an irony that the only party which ensured free elections is now barred from participating,” she said. For India too, it’s imperative that Awami League be allowed to contest elections that are genuinely fair and inclusive.","Deposed Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina was Monday sentenced to death in absentia for the violent 2024 student crackdown.

'Boycott politics never work': South Africa President reacts to Trump's no-show at G20; US fires sharp response,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/boycott-politics-never-work-south-africa-president-reacts-to-trumps-no-show-at-g20-us-fires-sharp-response/articleshow/125476117.cms,"



South African President Cyril Ramaphosa on Friday said the United States had shown signs of reconsidering its G20 boycott, calling it a “positive sign” and insisting that “boycott politics never work,” even as the White House dismissed his claim as “fake news” and accused him of “running his mouth. ”“In a way, we see this as a positive sign because, as I’ve often said, boycott politics never work. It’s always best to be inside the tent than being outside of the tent,” the President added.Ramaphosa said Pretoria had received a last-minute communication suggesting Washington might participate “in one shape or form or other” at the Johannesburg summit. “We have received notice from the United States, a notice which we are still in discussions with them over, about a change of mind, about participating in one shape or form or other in the summit,” he said. “This comes at the late hour before the summit begins. And so therefore, we do need to engage in those types of discussions to see how practical it is and what it finally really means.”The White House rejected any suggestion of a reversal. A senior official said only the acting ambassador, Marc D Dillard, would attend the ceremonial handover of the G20 presidency. “This is fake news. The chargé d'affaires in Pretoria will attend the handover ceremony as a formality, but the United States is not joining G20 discussions,” the official said.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reinforced Washington’s position. “The United States is not participating in official talks at the G20 in South Africa,” she said. She added: “I saw the South African president running his mouth a little bit against the United States and the president of the United States earlier today, and that language is not appreciated by the president or his team.” She noted that Dillard would only “receive that send off at the end of the event” and would not “participate in official talks. ”Ramaphosa reiterated that the United States “needs to be here,” saying: “The United States, being the biggest economy in the world, needs to be here. So it's pleasing to hear that there is a change of approach.”The US boycott follows allegations from Washington that South Africa discriminates against white people and Trump’s claims of violence against white Afrikaner farmers, assertions widely rejected in South Africa. Pretoria said Washington also pressured it not to issue a joint G20 declaration, arguing consensus would be impossible without the United States.Ramaphosa pushed back. “We will have a declaration. The talks are going extremely well. I’m confident we are moving towards a declaration, and they are now just dotting the i’s and crossing the t’s,” he said. “We will not be bullied. We will not agree to be bullied.”The US embassy had separately informed Pretoria that South Africa’s G20 agenda “run counter to the US policy views and we cannot support consensus on any documents negotiated under your presidency.”The summit, the first hosted by an African nation, focuses on debt relief for low-income countries, a just energy transition and securing critical minerals. While leaders including Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin and Javier Milei skipped the event, they sent delegations.Political tensions between the two countries have intensified during Trump’s second term, with high US tariffs on South African goods, Pretoria’s ambassador being expelled and Washington also boycotting the COP30 climate talks in Brazil.Despite the diplomatic friction, US business interests in South Africa remain strong, with more than 600 American companies operating in the country. “The US Chamber of Commerce will use our B20 leadership to foster international collaboration,” chamber head Suzanne Clark said.G20 ambassador Xolisa Mabhongo summed up the stand-off, saying: “The only country that is not in the room is the United States and, of course, it is their choice not to be in the room.”","South African President Cyril Ramaphosa says the United States has shown signs of reconsidering its G20 boycott.

What did Trump say about helping to end war in Sudan?





United States President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he intends to turn his focus to helping find a resolution to the civil war in Sudan between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).The announcement came after Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman used his first trip to Washington in seven years to urge the US leader to intervene in the conflict.According to Trump, the war, which began in 2023, ""wasn't on my charts"" before the dialogue with the crown prince.""His majesty would like me to do something very powerful having to do with Sudan,"" he said at a business forum with the Saudi royal.In response, Sudan's sovereign council, which is led by army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, said it would be willing to cooperate with the US and Saudi Arabia to bring peace.In a statement, Fattah al-Burhan expressed a ""readiness to seriously engage with them to achieve the peace that the Sudanese people hope for.""According to the Republican president, his belief — prior to the crown prince's intervention — was that the war in Sudan ""was just something that was crazy and out of control.""Although the conflict had apparently not made it onto Trump's radar, behind the scenes, many within the US government had been making concerted efforts to find a way towards peace.As recently as November 14, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the UAE's foreign minister to ask Abu Dhabi to back a Sudan ceasefire.The fighting for control of Sudan has killed over 40,000 people and is said to have displaced over 14 million people.At a lunch with Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman and a number of Saudi business leaders, Trump said the Middle Eastern country's leader had told him ending the conflict ""would be the greatest thing you can do, that would be greater than what you've already done.""Speaking to the crown prince, Trump added: ""I see how important that is to you, and to a lot of your friends in the room, Sudan.

The TOI correspondent from Washington:





US President Donald Trump doubled down on his support for foreign skilled labor at a US-Saudi investment forum on Wednesday, presenting the need for overseas professionals to train American workers in high-tech manufacturing as part of his MAGA agenda even as his base bristled with resentment at his framing.Speaking alongside Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Trump declared, ""I love MAGA – This IS MAGA!"" as he defended the need for foreign workers. But his remarks, which explicitly welcomed ""thousands of people"" from abroad to staff multibillion-dollar chip factories, sparked a fierce backlash from MAGA loyalists who accused him of abandoning ""America First"" principles in favor of “tech bros” and globalist donors, while insisting the US has enough talent for the jobs.In remarks that were parsed endlessly in MAGA-sphere, Trump linked the trillions in investment he claims to output from immigration stance, arguing that without foreign expertise, projects arising from the inflow would stall. ""You can't open a massive computer chip factory for billions of dollars, like in Arizona, and think you can hire people off an unemployment line to run it,"" he said. ""They have to bring thousands of people and I will WELCOME those people."" The framing is in line with expert opinion that the US lacks talented workforce in niche areas.""Those people will teach OUR people how to make computer chips. And in a short period of time, our people will do great and those people can GO HOME!"" Trump insisted, positioning the policy as a bridge to long-term American dominance. He referenced a real-world example, recounting how he halted an immigration raid on South Korean engineers at a Georgia battery plant, telling officials: ""Stop it. Don’t be stupid.”But many MAGA faithful expressed skepticism insisting that current policy is not geared towards sending foreign workers back, even as they expanded their fight to stop even foreign college admissions which they say provides another channel for immigration. Trump has also made known his support for the inflow of foreign students, saying they are needed to keep American universities solvent.The MAGA supremo acknowledged the political tightrope, quipping, ""I may take a little heat from my people, the people that love me. They happen to be toward the right of center. Sometimes WAY right."" He dismissed critics as ""unbelievable patriots"" who ""just don’t understand our people need to be taught,"" adding that his poll numbers might dip but rise among ""smart people.""Traditionally, surveys show that Trump polls better among the less educated voters and his numbers dip among college graduates. The foreign workers issue, part of the larger debate on immigration, looks set to become a lightning rod in the mid-term Congressional elections a year from now.","US President Donald Trump doubled down on his support for foreign skilled labor at a US-Saudi investment forum on Wednesday.

'No Talent In U.S.': Trump BURNS MAGA Base For India Reset? What It Means For Indian Workers





US President Donald Trump defended the use of skilled foreign workers, H1-B visas at the US-Saudi Investment Forum in Washington on Wednesday, saying they are essential to getting large technology projects up and running and that he would “welcome those people”, a stance that was not appreciated by the MAGA base.Speaking at the event, Trump pointed to a planned computer chip factory in Arizona as an example, arguing it was unrealistic to expect employers to hire from the unemployment line for highly technical roles. He said, “You can't come in, open a massive computer chip factory for billions and billions of dollars like is being done in Arizona, and think you're gonna hire people off an unemployment line to run it. They're gonna have to bring thousands of people with them and I'm gonna welcome those people. I love my conservative friends, I love MAGA, but this is MAGA.”The president's comments follow weeks of debate inside conservative circles after he told Fox News that the United States lacks talent for certain specialist industries and needs to bring in skilled workers to train American labour. At the forum he repeated that message, saying foreign experts will teach Americans to operate advanced factories and that this is in the national interest.Hardline MAGA supporters accused Trump of abandoning his America First promise by appearing to side with corporate interests and foreign labour. While some Republicans had the GOP leader's back.Congresswoman and former Trumo loyalist Marjorie Taylor Greene blasted POTUS’s H-1B remarks, saying American students were being “pushed aside for foreign tech workers”, while right-wing political activist Laura Loomer claimed the president was being steered into “globalist policy”. Nick Fuentes called the stance a “betrayal of the movement”, arguing that MAGA voters never asked for more imported labour. Tesla CEO Elon Musk took a softer line, saying the US still needs top-tier engineers for chip factories but urged companies to train Americans instead of relying on “permanent visa pipelines”. Indian-origin MAGA ally Dinesh D’Souza defended Trump as “pragmatic”, and Vivek Ramaswamy argued that specialised roles can’t be filled overnight.Earlier in September, Trump had floated a $100,000 price tag for a national “talent challenge,” arguing that America would need to invest heavily to compete with China and rebuild critical industries. That message now sits awkwardly beside his defence of H-1B visas.","US President Donald Trump defended the use of skilled foreign workers, H1-B visas at the US-Saudi Investment Forum in Washington on Wednesday.

""We Are Done..."" Trump Recalls Critical Modi Call That Averted India-Pakistan Nuclear Clash





US President Donald Trump is insisting Prime Minister Narendra Modi called him to end the war against Pakistan after he (Trump) threatened a 350 percent tariff against both countries. The claim comes on the heels of a congressional report crediting Pakistan's battlefield “success” to Chinese weaponry and accusing Beijing of exploiting the chaos for geopolitical gain, even as Trump is hawking US arms across the world, Saudi Arabia being the latest recipient.Trump’s narrative on settling the India-Pak war, which gets more elaborate with each telling (more than 60 times so far), included Modi calling him to say “We’re done” with the war, which in the US President’s view would have gone nuclear and resulted in nuclear dust over Los Angeles. New Delhi has repeatedly denied there was any call between the two leaders during or immediately after the short four-day clash.Trump’s assertions, which get more embellishments with each recall, came hours after a two-page analysis in the 2025 Annual Report to Congress by the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC) – a bipartisan panel mandated to scrutinize Sino-American security dynamics – framed Pakistan's ""military success"" as a showcase for Beijing's arsenal, which constitutes 82% of Islamabad's arms imports from 2019–2023.""Pakistan’s military success over India in its four-day clash showcased Chinese weaponry,"" the document asserts, citing the combat debut of HQ-9 surface-to-air missiles and Wing Loong II drones that reportedly intercepted Indian incursions. “While characterization of this conflict as a “proxy war” may overstate China’s role as an instigator, Beijing opportunistically leveraged the conflict to test and advertise the sophistication of its weapons, useful in the contexts of its ongoing border tensions with India and its expanding defense industry goals,” the report said. It also spotlights pre-conflict Sino-Pakistani drills: the Warrior-VIII land exercises in October 2024 and the AMAN-2025 naval maneuvers in February, which honed interoperability in contested airspace.The disquisition on Chinese arms comes even as Trump, a self-professed peacemaker, boasts frequently about the primacy and sophistication of U.S military hardware, hawking it to allies in Europe, the Gulf, and East Asia. Earlier this week, the Trump administration notified Congress its approval for the sale of Javelin anti-tank system and Excalibur projectiles to India in a $93 million contract -- chump change compared to the billions in sales it is lining up for Saudi Arabia. The U.S is also trying to wean Pakistan away from Chinese military dependence.The USSC report meanwhile alleged that post India-Pak ceasefire, Beijing orchestrated a sophisticated disinformation blitz to undermine western arms. Using AI-generated deepfakes and morphed imagery, Chinese state-linked actors flooded social media with fabricated footage of Rafale jets malfunctioning, aiming to erode French arms sales in South Asia, it said. This ploy reportedly swayed Indonesia to suspend a $8.1 billion Rafale deal in June 2025, redirecting interest toward China's J-35 stealth fighter. ""The conflict drew global attention to the China-Pakistan defense nexus,"" the report warns, underscoring escalation risks in a nuclear flashpoint where miscalculation could cascade regionally.The report also looks at the “asymmetry” in the degrees to which China and India prioritize establishing a long-term solution to their border dispute. In recent years, it says, the Indian government has increasingly recognized the seriousness of the threat posed by China at the border—and that it is not merely “acne on the face,” especially as China’s military has strengthened.“It remains to be seen whether China’s and India’s 2025 commitments are a short-term function of India’s desire to hedge against tumult in trade negotiations with the United States or are a long-term shift toward normalization in bilateral relations,” the report says, reflecting on the Modi-Xi meeting in Tianjin.","US President Donald Trump is insisting Prime Minister Narendra Modi called him to end the war against Pakistan.

"Nikki Haley's son says US must limit international students, claims some are ‘spies for foreign governments’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nikki-haleys-son-says-us-must-limit-foreign-students-claims-some-are-spies-for-foreign-governments/articleshow/125467145.cms,"



Nalin Haley, son of former US ambassador and South Carolina governor Nikki Haley , has called for strict limits on international students entering American universities, warning that some may be acting as “spies for foreign governments.”Speaking in a recent interview with Tucker Carlson, the 24-year-old Indian-origin argued that the United States must prioritise native-born Americans as part of a “America First” agenda.Haley also repeated his claim that naturalised citizens should not be allowed to hold public office, insisting that only those raised entirely in the United States can fully understand the country’s values. He went further, calling dual citizenship a “stupid idea” and arguing that individuals with ties to another nation should not serve in the US military. Nalin has been an active anti-immigrant loudmouth which some of the MAGA base respects.Earlier this month, Nalin also called to end H-1B visas and halt all legal immigration. Haley has argued that foreign workers are taking opportunities from young Americans, saying that several of his own friends with strong educational backgrounds are still struggling to find jobs. He directly linked this unemployment to an oversupply of migrant workers.His comments come as Donald Trump has taken a softer stance on H-1B visas, saying the US government cannot stop the influx of foreign skilled workers because the country “lacks talent” and needs immigrants to fill crucial sectors such as technology and defence. The MAGA base has attacked the US president for going back on his “America First” agenda, but the White House has defended Trump.","Nalin Haley, son of former US ambassador and South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, has called for strict limits on international students entering American universities.

“This is a total invasion of this family’s privacy.”

“I’m just glad that Ray, Lorene, and Timmy are in a clean environment now, with healthy meals to eat and the ability to take showers and stay clean.”





The dirt road into Odd, West Virginia, bends gently between tree lines and a seam of rusted fencing before opening onto the Whittaker property, a scatter of collapsing structures that look as though they have been exhaling for decades. The house, its siding warped by seasons, sits back from the road behind a porch where Halloween skeletons still dangle beside Christmas angels, their plastic limbs rattling in the slightest wind. Towels hang from a makeshift clothesline. Old tyres, crushed beer cans, chipped buckets and sagging refuse bins pool around the steps. The yard is littered with objects that once held purpose and now simply mark the passing of time.Inside, the air is thick with the smell of gas from a stove where beans and sausage have been left out, congealing as flies drift across the counters. The television blares in the background, absorbed by a room whose calendar remains frozen on March. Outside the window, beyond a collapsing chicken coop and several broken trailers wearing the weather like a permanent bruise, stands the family outhouse.This is the scene reporters from the Daily Mail encountered when they returned to the Whittakers’ home after the recent removals, the isolated West Virginia property long occupied by the Whittakers, widely known as America’s most inbred family, who have lived most of their lives out of public view and far from the wider community, and which once held seven or eight voices but now holds only two.Betty, seventy-three, and Larry, sixty-nine, occupy the house in the same unadorned way the house seems to occupy the land. Their days are quiet. Their relatives are gone. And they say they haven’t been told where.In September, three Whittakers, Ray, 72; his sister Lorene, 79; and Lorene’s son Timmy, 46, were removed from the family’s home in Odd, West Virginia by adult protective services, according to relatives who spoke to the. The operation was carried out quietly, and the two siblings left behind, Betty, 73, and Larry, 69, said no explanation was given to them at the time.Betty recalled being told only that the three relativesadding,She and Larry have had no contact with them since the day they were taken.Larry said he has received no information from authorities about their location or condition.he said.He believes the sudden intervention followed the enormous attention generated by online videos of the family.he saidOfficials from West Virginia’s Department of Human Services told the Daily Mail that they were “aware of the situation” but could not discuss the case “due to confidentiality laws.” The agency reportedly refused to comment further because of “the ongoing nature of the matter.”For the Whittakers, who lived most of their lives unseen by anyone outside their rural community, the shift from obscurity to global exposure, and now to forced separation, has left the remaining siblings without answers and without the family members they had cared for their entire lives.The Whittakers’ story stretches back more than a century through the wooded hills of West Virginia. Their inbreeding traces to a single marriage between two sets of cousins descended from identical twin brothers, a convergence that effectively folded the family tree in on itself.Their parents, according to The Sun, were “first cousins, twice, because they share both sets of grandparents.”Identical twin brothers Henry and John Whittaker had children who later married each other, beginning a cycle of consanguineous unions that persisted through generations.Scientists point to the predictable but devastating pattern known as “inbreeding depression,” a term that describes the expression of harmful recessive genes passed repeatedly through the same bloodline. A 2021 study by the University of San Francisco Valley, Brazil, noted that “There is an association between high rates of marriage between relatives and the development of congenital malformations, abortions, deafness, esophageal atresia, and mental and physical disabilities. ”The Whittakers exemplified these consequences. Lorraine and Ray often communicated through grunts rather than speech; one relative told filmmaker Mark Laita, “They understand what you talking about. If they don’t like it, they start yelling – let you know they don’t like that idea.” The family did not know their genetic issues were the result of inbreeding. When Laita pressed them about physical abnormalities in his earlier films, Kenneth once suggested, “Might be coal mining. ”Yet, for most of their history, the family’s struggles were private, until a filmmaker walked up the dirt drive.The Whittakers became a global spectacle in 2020 when filmmaker Mark Laita uploaded a twelve-minute documentary to his YouTube channel Soft White Underbelly. The video, meant to highlight “untold stories from across the country,” revealed the family’s living conditions and genetic isolation with an intimacy that shocked viewers. Laita described it asHe had first met the family in 2004 when he was taking photographs for his book. Even then, the encounter came with resistance: “protective” neighbours confronted him with a shotgun, he recalled on the Koncrete podcast, explainingOver the years he returned, filming more footage. Laita has compared the family to characters from the 1972 thriller. He said,The 2020 documentary drew tens of millions of views. Soft White Underbelly’s uploads turned the Whittakers from a sheltered, isolated household into a global curiosity. According to Laita, interest grew so quickly that he needed a police escort to return to the property.As viewers circled the videos, curiosity seekers began circling the house. Neighbours report that people regularly drove down the dirt track to film, photograph, or simply stare at the family’s home.For a clan that once fled from strangers, the world had suddenly arrived on their porch.With Ray, Lorene and Timmy taken by adult protective services, the house in Odd now holds only Betty and Larry, who continue living in what reporters described as squalid conditions: a stove left running, food cooling on the burners, insects moving across the counters, and a yard strewn with discarded items, broken structures and holiday decorations left out through the seasons. Betty has repeatedly said,Public reaction has been divided. Some accuse the internet of turning the family’s hardships into entertainment. One reader commented,Others expressed cautious relief:What the state is doing with the three relatives remains unknown. Under confidentiality laws, no agency has released any information about their location or welfare.Meanwhile, Betty and Larry remain at the property in Odd, carrying on in the home where they have lived for decades, and where they continue to wait for news about the family members removed without explanation.","Lorene, 79; Timmy, 46; Betty, 73; Ray, 72; and Larry, 69, were removed from the family’s home in Odd, West Virginia.

He expressed concerns over foreign nationals serving in the US military, emphasizing that allegiance to America should come first.

Indian-origin Nikki Haley 's son Nalin Haley stirred a row after telling Tucker Carlson that dual citizenship in the United States is the “stupidest idea” and that there is no grey line around national identity.Nalin is the son of former US Ambassador to the UN and former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley. The 24-year-old argued that a person can only belong to one country, saying “you’re either American or you’re not.”During the interview, Carlson asked whether people with ties to other countries should be allowed to serve in the US military. Nalin dismissed the idea entirely. “Hello no,” he said, calling the suggestion “insane.” He added, “Dual citizenship is bad enough, but to serve in the military is… disqualifying really.” Carlson responded, “Of course,” backing the stance.Nalin also said America should not permit dual citizenship of any kind. “People should have their loyalty to America first,” he said. Carlson is also a rigt-wing political podcaster who mostly agreed with the 'America First' stance of Nalin.Nalin's comments follow a series of hardline statements about immigration, foreign students and the H-1B system.Nalin has repeatedly blamed migrant workers and international students for limiting opportunities for young Americans. In an earlier Fox News appearance, he claimed he had seen his own friends lose out because foreign applicants snatch those places from them.Nalin has become a celebrated figure among sections of the MAGA base who oppose the presence of Indian and Chinese students in the US, even as Trump now argues that America lacks “talent” and needs skilled foreign workers for industries such as tech and defence.Carlson said that many of Nalin’s ideas are very different from the modern Republican Party, as most MAGA leaders now accept that the US economy needs foreign skilled labour in one way or another, with even Trump saying US lacks ""talent.""

A judiciary under reconstruction



Munir’s expanding power base



(With inputs from agencies)





Pakistan’s judiciary is in a moment of crisis as senior judges resign amid a contentious constitutional amendment reshapes the balance of power in favour of the military. Behind the crisis is the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment, a sweeping package pushed through parliament within days. Lawyers, judges and opposition parties argue that it has weakened the courts and elevated the military’s top commander to a position with no modern parallel.Since then, Pakistan’s judiciary has been hit by a series of high-profile resignations. On Saturday, Lahore High Court judge Shams Mehmood Mirza stepped down, and his family said his decision was directly linked to the 27th Amendment. His departure followed those of Supreme Court justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah, who issued sharply worded letters condemning the amendment as a direct attack on judicial independence.The creation of a new Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) lies at the heart of judicial restructuring. The FCC now holds exclusive jurisdiction over constitutional matters, stripping the Supreme Court of its original powers. Pending petitions have already been shifted to the new court. President Zardari swore in Justice Aminuddin Khan as its first chief justice; six other judges were appointed, including serving Supreme Court and high court judges, though one judge reportedly refused to join.The FCC’s establishment has sparked intense concern. Critics say the president’s new power to transfer judges risks becoming a tool to sideline dissenting voices. Opposition groups argue this will fundamentally weaken judicial independence and concentrate constitutional authority in the executive and military leadership.Government ministers, however, hailed the package as “historic” and a step toward greater efficiency and national unity. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the amendment proved that “solidarity” prevailed during a time of national strain.With judges resigning, courts being reconfigured, and the military gaining unprecedented constitutional control, Pakistan faces a moment of reckoning.The amendment passed with overwhelming numbers in both houses has dramatically restructured Pakistan’s defence architecture, elevating army chief Asim Munir to Chief of Defence Forces with command over all three military branches. His five-year tenure now resets from the date of notification, enabling him to remain in office until 2030.The Senate has since rushed through four related bills, including amendments to the Army, Air Force and Navy Acts, along with changes to Supreme Court practice rules. These laws remove the earlier equality among service chiefs and replace references to the Joint Chiefs of Staff system with a new “National Strategic Command”, further centralising military authority under Munir.Dawn reported that appointments, extensions, and tenures under these reforms “shall not be called into question before any court on any ground whatsoever”.Experts quoted in multiple reports warn that the shift risks internal military tensions and further erodes civilian oversight. Lawyer Osama Malik described the reforms as something “usually granted in absolute monarchies”, arguing they grant lifetime protections not only to Munir but also to President Zardari.Opposition lawmakers responded with uproar, shredding copies of the bill and walking out. PTI leaders labelled the move “deeply undemocratic” and “the final nail in the coffin of an independent judiciary”. Critics say these changes could reshape the political landscape, particularly for nearly 200 cases involving former prime minister Imran Khan.","Pakistan's judiciary is in a moment of crisis as senior judges resign amid a contentious constitutional amendment.

Judicial restructuring: Federal constitutional court



Political reactions



What next







Pakistan’s National Assembly on Wednesday passed the 27th constitutional amendment bill, granting sweeping powers to the military in general and country’s army chief Asim Munir in specific, and restructuring the judiciary.The vote, held amid a ruckus in the lower house, saw 234 lawmakers in favour and only four against, speaker Ayaz Sadiq announced. The session was attended by top political leaders, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, PML-N President Nawaz Sharif, and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.The amendment comes at a time of heightened political tension in Pakistan, with the ruling coalition seeking to consolidate control over key defence and judicial institutions. The legislation follows earlier Senate approval, where it received 64 votes in favour and no opposition, as the opposition benches boycotted proceedings.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed the passage as a demonstration of national unity, saying the house exhibited solidarity. He also condemned a recent terrorist incident in Wana, drawing parallels to the Army Public School massacre, and praised law enforcement for securing the safety of students and cadets.The amendment elevates Pakistan army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir to the newly created role of Chief of Defence Forces, giving him constitutional authority over all three branches: army, navy, and air force. Honorary five-star ranks such as field marshal, marshal of the air force, and admiral of the fleet remain lifetime titles. According to the country's law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, the reform “aims to bring constitutional oversight to defence appointments while preserving military honour and tradition.The bill also establishes a federal constitutional court (FCC) to handle constitutional and provincial matters, leaving the Supreme Court to focus on civil and criminal cases. The FCC will have equal representation from all provinces and the power to take suo motu notices on constitutional petitions. The Judicial Commission will oversee judge transfers; refusal of a transfer will be treated as retirement.The ruling coalition, including PML-N, PPP, MQM-P, and allies, backed the amendment. Opposition lawmakers condemned it as unconstitutional. PTI chairman Gohar Ali Khan called it the “Baku Amendments” and accused the government of undermining democracy. Mehmood Khan Achakzai of PkMAP protested by tearing a copy of the bill in the house.The amendment now returns to the Senate for final approval before becoming law. Analysts say the 27th amendment significantly strengthens Munir’s role in Pakistan’s military hierarchy while altering judicial oversight, marking a shift in Pakistan’s institutional framework.(With input from agencies, Dawn)","The amendment elevates Pakistan army chief Asim Munir to the newly created role of Chief of Defence Forces.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment

Why it matters

The big picture

The Field Marshal’s expanding power evokes a hybrid of Pakistan’s two most dominant military rulers:

Ayub Khan, who introduced centralized presidential control and laid the foundations for military-led governance.

Zia-ul-Haq, who used the Army and Islamization to seize power, marginalize the judiciary, and suppress civilian opposition.

Munir is consolidating power not through martial law, but via constitutional amendments passed by a pliant parliament.

If Zia’s coup was loud and brutal against a strong popular leadership, Munir’s is silent, yet possibly more far reaching, being done through a political front office that’s pliant and dependent on the Army for authority. With Imran Khan in prison, any opposition will come from the streets and the troubled insurgencies to the west of Islamabad.

Pranab Dhal Samanta in the Economic Times

Zoom in

The transformation follows the India-Pakistan conflict in May 2025, a four-day exchange of air and missile strikes after the Pahalgam terror attack.

India’s Operation Sindoor targeted Pakistani airbases, radars, and command centers.

Pakistan requested a ceasefire after intense damage - a request reportedly initiated by Pakistan’s DGMO.

Donald Trump, who claimed to have brokered the truce(India has repeatedly denied the US President's claims), was effusively thanked by Munir and PM Shehbaz Sharif. Trump now calls Munir his “favorite field marshal.”

The Financial Times described their dynamic as a “bromance,” with Trump showcased on billboards across Pakistan alongside Munir and Sharif.

This international validation was followed by Munir’s promotion to Field Marshal, the second such promotion in Pakistan’s history - and the first codified under the Constitution.

Between the lines

This isn’t just about military command - it’s about rewriting the DNA of the Pakistani state.

The amendment creates a new Federal Constitutional Court, potentially diluting the powers of the Supreme Court and creating ambiguity about the hierarchy of judicial authority.

President Zardari is also granted lifelong immunity in the amendment, mirroring the legal shield given to Munir.

This dual protection signals a strategic alliance between the military and top civilian figures to institutionalize mutual insulation from accountability.

“Too much has been left to ad hoc and arbitrary decisions,” Mazari warned.

The domestic question: Can repression deliver reform?

The three-front storm: Taliban, TTP, and India

“If you nurture snakes in your backyard, they will bite you,” said Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the Pakistani military’s official spokesman, referencing the Taliban. What a comeuppance : The remark could just as well apply to all Pakistan-grown terror groups and the TTP, whose resurgence is a grim case of blowback.

The bottom line





In Pakistan, where generals have often ruled with impunity and influence, Field Marshal Asim Munir is scripting a new playbook-quiet, precise, and constitutionally sealed. His rise is not just another chapter in the country’s well-worn saga of military dominance. It is, as one senior opposition leader put it, “a rewrite of the entire power manual.”Pakistan’s controversial 27th Constitutional Amendment proposes to recast the country’s military command structure by abolishing the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) and creating the role of Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) - a position that will be held by the Army Chief, currently Field Marshal Asim Munir •The amendment vests unprecedented legal and constitutional power in the CDF, giving Munir operational and institutional control over the army, navy, and air force, as well as the country’s nuclear command.•It also grants five-star officers life-long rank, privileges, and immunity, a move seen as creating a parallel unelected authority beyond the reach of civilian or judicial oversight.“This amendment appears tailored to benefit a specific individual rather than to strengthen the defence structure,” Lt Gen Asif Yasin Malik, former defence secretary, told Dawn.The CJCSC post - created after the 1971 war to ensure coordination among services - will be dissolved on November 27, 2025, when the current chairman, Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza, retires.The 27th Amendment represents the largest shift in Pakistan’s civil-military balance since the Zia era, codifying the military’s supremacy in a way that future civilian governments may struggle to reverse.•The military will no longer merely influence governance from behind the scenes - it will be constitutionally entrenched at the center of executive authority.•Strategic nuclear assets, previously overseen by the National Command Authority, will now fall under the commander of national strategic command, appointed by the PM on the army chief’s advice, and selected from within the army.“All nuclear weapons and delivery systems will be under army control, including second-strike missiles traditionally under the Navy,” warned Dr Shireen Mazari, former human rights minister, a Dawn report said.•The change grants the army a monopoly over promotions, transfers, and postings across the services, threatening morale and inter-service harmony.“If promotions in the Air Force and Navy are determined by an army-origin CDF, it could lead to festering resentments,” Mazari cautioned.At home, Munir is both omnipresent and embattled. According to a Financial Times report, his supporters compare him to Mohammed bin Salman or South Korea’s General Park - ruthless modernisers willing to bulldoze institutions in the name of reform. His critics, however, see echoes of Zia-ul-Haq’s theocratic militarism cloaked in constitutional legitimacy.The judiciary is already split, thanks to a proposed constitutional court that would dilute the Supreme Court’s power. Journalists are censored, civil rights groups are muzzled, and political opponents - most notably former Prime Minister Imran Khan - are jailed or silenced.And yet, Munir has cast himself as the architect of reform. In his speech at the Pakistan Military Academy, he spoke of “treasures hidden beneath our land” and claimed that Pakistan had begun to “regain its rightful place in the comity of nations.”But the economy tells another story. As per the FT report, Pakistan’s investment rate is the lowest in South Asia, its poverty rate has risen to 25%, and its youth unemployment is dangerously high. The country remains dependent on IMF bailouts and Gulf financing that has yet to materialise in promised volumes.While Munir consolidates power at home, Pakistan finds itself encircled by a resurgent triangle of threats - each historically rooted, each dangerously revived. In the west, the Afghan Taliban’s return to power in 2021 has proved more liability than leverage. Once covertly supported by Pakistan’s security establishment, the Taliban now resist Islamabad’s demands and turn a blind eye to cross-border attacks on Pakistani soil.More ominously, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an offshoot long declared outlawed, has regrouped in Afghanistan and resumed attacks in Pakistan’s tribal belt and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. This year alone, militant violence has killed over 1,400 people - the highest toll in a decade.“The military simply lacks political support on the ground there,” Iftikhar Firdous, founder of The Khorasan Diary, told FT. “The crackdown has alienated entire communities.”Simultaneously, Pakistan’s eastern border with India remains fragile after the four-day air conflict in May.Add to that domestic insurgencies in Balochistan and the Pashtun belt, and Pakistan now faces not one, but three overlapping security fronts. Instead of acting as a force-multiplier, the military’s expanding political and economic footprint is beginning to stretch its operational capacity thin.The 27th Amendment enshrines military supremacy in Pakistan's Constitution under the guise of reform and modernization.•It moves the country further away from parliamentary democracy, and deeper into military-led constitutional authoritarianism.•As Field Marshal Asim Munir prepares to become the first Chief of Defence Forces, Pakistan’s most consequential question remains: Can a military man fix a failing nation - or will history repeat itself?(With inputs from agencies)","Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment.

ISLAMABAD: A suicide bomber killed 12 people outside a court in Islamabad on Tuesday in a sharp escalation of militant violence that the defence minister said had pushed the country into a ""state of war"".Pakistani govt ministers accused neighbouring Afghanistan of complicity in the bloodshed - an accusation Kabul denied - and vowed retaliation if Afghan authorities failed to rein in the militants Islamabad says were responsible. ""We are in a state of war,"" said defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif after the attack, the first strike on civilians in Islamabad in a decade. ""Bringing this war to Islamabad is a message from Kabul, to which Pakistan has the full power to respond. ""The bombing outside an Islamabad court also wounded 27 people interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said. The court bomber blew himself up near the entrance at around lunchtime. Images on local media showed people covered in blood lying next to a police van. A vehicle was seen on fire and another car was badly damaged. Police cordoned off the site. Naqvi said the bomber had tried to enter the court building on foot but, unable to find a way in, detonated the device outside, close to a police vehicle.Several of the wounded were in critical condition, a hospital source said.No group claimed responsibility for Tuesday's attack. The main Pakistani militant group, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), denied involvement in the attacks. But a group affiliated with the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, according to The Khorasan Diary, a digital platform in Islamabad that monitors militant activity in the region.TTP militants have in recent years focused attacks on security forces. Civilians had not been hit in Islamabad for a decade, according to Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, a group that tracks attacks.Islamabad says that the Pakistani Taliban and other militants are based in Afghanistan, with the support of India. ""We are totally clear that Afghanistan has to stop them. In case of a failure, we have no option but to take care of those terrorists who are attacking our country,"" Naqvi said, speaking at the scene of the court bombing. The Taliban administration spokesperson in Kabul did not respond to a request for comment on Pakistan's accusations.The court attack happened hours after militants stormed a school near the Afghan border on Monday. The attack on the school in Wana, in the north west, began Monday, when a suicide vehicle rammed the main entrance, killing three people, Naqvi said. Militants then entered the school, which is run by the military but educates civilians.By Tuesday evening, three militants were still inside the compound, security officials said, with rescue operations under way for the students trapped in another part of the school. Naqvi said that the school assailants were in contact with their handlers in Afghanistan during the attack.Reuters","A suicide bomber killed 12 people outside a court in Islamabad on Tuesday in a sharp escalation of militant violence.

Attack outside court complex



Surge in militant violence and worsening ties with Afghanistan







Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif said the country was “in a state of war” after a suicide bomber struck outside the Islamabad district courts on Tuesday, killing at least 12 people and injuring 27.The blast one of the deadliest to hit the capital in recent years has intensified tensions with Afghanistan, with Asif accusing the Taliban government in Kabul of allowing militants to operate freely.In a post on X, Asif said: “Anyone who thinks that the Pakistan army is fighting this war in the Afghan-Pakistan border region and the remote areas of Balochistan should take today’s suicide attack at the Islamabad district courts as a wake-up call: This is a war for all of Pakistan.”He wrote that Pakistan’s military was making “daily sacrifices while providing citizens with a sense of protection and security”, but warned that hoping for negotiations with Kabul would be a “mistake”. Asif insisted that Afghanistan “has the ability to prevent terrorist attacks inside Pakistan” and that bringing the conflict to the capital was “a message from Kabul”.He added that Pakistan “has the strength to respond fully”, saying the attack had erased any remaining doubts about the threat posed by militants operating from Afghan soil.The explosion took place around midday in Islamabad’s G-11 district, just outside the judicial complex where hundreds of lawyers and visitors were present. Police said the attacker tried to enter the court premises but failed, eventually detonating explosives next to a police vehicle, igniting cars and sending a fireball through the street.Interior minister Mohsin Naqvi confirmed that 12 people were killed and 27 wounded. He said authorities had recovered a severed head believed to be that of the attacker, and CCTV footage captured him moments before the blast. Witnesses described scenes of chaos, with people screaming for help as ambulances rushed to the site.The blast comes amid a sharp rise in militant violence across Pakistan. Security officials say the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has carried out hundreds of attacks this year, mostly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa near the Afghan border, but strikes in major cities have been rare. Islamabad was last hit by a suicide attack three years ago.On Monday night, militants also attempted to storm an army-run college in Wana, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Security forces killed two attackers quickly, while others were cornered inside an administrative building. Students and staff were evacuated, and the military said the assault resembled the TTP’s 2014 massacre in Peshawar that killed 154 people.Pakistan says the Afghan Taliban have allowed TTP fighters to take refuge across the border. Afghanistan denies harbouring the group. Peace talks between Islamabad and Kabul have stalled, with Pakistan demanding written guarantees that Afghan territory will not be used for attacks.",Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif says country is in a state of war.
