The administration was asked to submit a comprehensive report by Dec 17, after conducting local inquiries, on ""whether it would be fit and proper for allowing any religious activity ... because of the incidents which happened at the behest of the contesting parties.""The crux of the dispute, the HC was told, lay in the claim of one person who claims ownership of the mosque - a place where the rival group also wants to offer prayers. The second group moved the HC first, claiming they were being stopped from offering prayers. On Nov 7, Justice Ghosh had directed both groups to offer prayers at any time convenient to them.

Conversely, Marathi-majority neighbourhoods of Shivaji Park, Lalbaug and Worli form the backbone of Shiv Sena's traditional base.This poll season, many parties leaned into the ""Marathi vs Gujarati"" narrative, invoking the exodus of industries to Gujarat in a bid to consolidate Marathi votes.Addressing a rally on the eve of the polls, Uddhav Thackeray underscored the Gujarat undercurrent in the elections. Criticising Modi and Shah for allegedly creating a divide, he appealed to Gujaratis to ""identify their real enemies,"" warning that this polarisation would have long-term consequences for their community.On Wednesday, though, the electorate seemed unimpressed by divisive rhetoric. ""We live peacefully here, side by side. Politicians may try to divide us, but we know better,"" said Hasmukh Mehta, a retired banker from Pant Nagar.

The case centers on accusations that the couple illegally acquired and sold state gifts worth over 140 million Pakistan rupees (£501,000) during Khan's tenure as prime minister from 2018 to 2022.

Nancy Mace: 'Sarah McBride is a biological man': The transgender bathroom row rocking the Capitol,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/sarah-mcbride-is-a-biological-man-the-transgender-bathroom-row-rocking-the-capitol/articleshow/115456724.cms,"Who is Nancy Mace?



Who is Sarah McBride?



How the Trans issue became the Dem's bugbear



After Delaware elected the first openly transgender member of Congress earlier this month, a Republican introduced a bill aiming to bar her from using the bathroom aligned with her gender identity. South Carolina Republican Nancy Mace proposed the legislation, which comes just under two months before Sarah McBride is set to be sworn in as the first openly transgender member of Congress. According to The Hill, the bill would task the House sergeant-at-arms with enforcement, though the exact methods remain unclear.“Sarah McBride doesn’t get a say. I mean, this is a biological man,” Mace told reporters on Monday, according to CNN. She went on to say McBride “does not belong in women’s spaces, women’s bathrooms, locker rooms, changing rooms, period, full stop.”McBride responded on X, calling the matter a distraction.“Everyday Americans work alongside people whose life journeys differ from their own and interact with them respectfully. I hope members of Congress can show that same kindness,” she wrote.“This is a blatant attempt by far-right extremists to distract from their lack of real solutions to the challenges Americans face. We should be focusing on lowering the cost of housing, healthcare, and childcare—not manufacturing culture wars. Delawareans sent me here to make the American dream more affordable and accessible, and that’s what I’m focused on.”During the final stages of his 2024 campaign, many of Donald Trump ’s advertisements also focused on transgender rights. One high-profile ad criticised Kamala Harris for her 2019 support of gender-affirming care and included the tagline, “Kamala is for they/them, President Trump is for you.” NPR reported that the Trump campaign spent at least $17 million on the ad. Trump defenders on the other hand have pointed out that the ad wasn't aimed at trans people but at the left's obssession with pronouns.Mace was once viewed as a moderate Republican representing a competitive district in South Carolina. In 2021, she supported a bill offering limited protections for LGBTQ+ individuals in public life.“I strongly support LGBTQ rights and equality,” Mace told the Washington Examiner at the time. “No one should be discriminated against.”However, after Republicans redrew her district to make it more safely Republican, she shifted significantly further to the right. Earlier this year, the US Supreme Court upheld the gerrymandering of her district as legal, despite a lower court’s finding that Republicans had effectively engaged in “bleaching” by removing 30,000 Black voters from the district.On Monday, Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene also misgendered McBride in a now-viral video where she voiced support for Mace’s bill.“I support a resolution that keeps all biological men out of women’s bathrooms, locker rooms, and private spaces—not only in the Capitol complex and office buildings but all taxpayer-funded facilities,” Greene said.When asked how such rules might be enforced, especially concerning McBride’s position as an openly transgender member of Congress, Greene responded, “Which is a man. He’s a man. He’s a biological male. So he is not allowed to use our women’s restrooms, our women’s gym, our locker rooms, and spaces specified for women. He’s got plenty of places he can go.”Mace's actions have faced widespread criticism, viewed by many as part of a broader ""culture war"" strategy by some Republicans, centred on transgender rights. Critics, including McBride, have described the legislation as a divisive distraction from addressing pressing issues such as housing, healthcare, and childcare costs. Mace’s shift from a moderate stance to more conservative positions has been noted, particularly following redistricting that made her South Carolina district more securely Republican.This controversy forms part of a larger narrative involving increasing legislation and rhetoric targeting transgender rights across the United States, including restrictions on bathroom access and participation in sports. Prominent Republicans, such as Marjorie Taylor Greene, have echoed similar sentiments, using McBride's election to bolster their opposition to transgender inclusion.The issue has further highlighted the deeply polarised debate surrounding LGBTQ+ rights and its role in political strategies ahead of the 2024 elections.Nancy Mace has served as the Republican congresswoman for South Carolina's 1st congressional district since 2021. Born on 4 December 1977 in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, she made history in 1999 as the first woman to graduate from The Citadel's Corps of Cadets programme. Before her time in Congress, Mace served in the South Carolina House of Representatives from 2018 to 2020. She is known for her fiscally conservative views and her support for conservation efforts. In November 2024, she introduced a bill aimed at restricting bathroom access for transgender individuals within the Capitol complex, specifically targeting Sarah McBride.Sarah McBride, born on 9 August 1990 in Wilmington, Delaware, is a Democratic politician and LGBTQ+ rights activist. She earned her bachelor's degree from American University in 2013 and has been a prominent advocate for transgender rights. In 2020, McBride made history as the first openly transgender state senator in the United States after her election to the Delaware State Senate. In November 2024, she was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, representing Delaware's at-large congressional district, becoming the first openly transgender member of Congress. Throughout her career, McBride has focused on issues including healthcare access, reproductive rights, and LGBTQ+ equality.The culture war over transgender rights has emerged as a flashpoint in US politics, with Democrats finding themselves in a precarious position. While the party’s progressive base champions LGBTQ+ equality, including transgender rights, Republican attacks have weaponized the issue to energize their own voters and drive wedges between Democrats and key swing constituencies.Trump’s campaign has also leaned heavily into this strategy, spending millions on advertisements that mock Democrats' focus on pronouns and gender-affirming care. These attacks are not aimed at transgender individuals per se but at portraying the left as overly focused on niche cultural issues, alienating moderate and independent voters. Polls consistently show that many Americans remain uncomfortable or divided over policies like gender-affirming care for minors or the participation of transgender women in women’s sports—positions Democrats overwhelmingly support.This dynamic poses a challenge for Democrats. While their stance aligns with progressive values and human rights, it risks being framed as prioritizing ideology over the bread-and-butter issues voters care about, such as healthcare, housing, and the economy. McBride herself alluded to this, calling Republican attacks a ""blatant distraction"" from pressing national challenges.The culture war rhetoric also deepens divisions within the Democratic Party. Moderates fear alienating suburban voters, particularly women, who might otherwise lean Democratic but harbor reservations about certain aspects of transgender rights. Conversely, progressive Democrats argue that compromising on these issues would betray the party’s commitment to equality and justice.Ultimately, Republicans have used the trans rights debate to define Democrats on unfavorable terms, diverting attention from more popular Democratic policies. If Democrats cannot reframe the narrative—focusing on inclusivity while addressing voters’ core economic concerns—they risk losing ground in battleground districts where cultural issues resonate. As the 2024 elections loom, the question remains whether Democrats can effectively counter these attacks or if the culture war over trans rights will continue to erode their support.","Sarah McBride is set to be sworn in as the first openly transgender member of Congress. South Carolina Republican Nancy Mace has introduced a bill aiming to bar her from using the bathroom aligned with her gender identity. Mace's actions have faced widespread criticism, viewed by many as part of a broader ""culture war"" strategy by some Republicans, centred on transgender rights.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115456768,imgsize-2109246,width-400,resizemode-4/115456768.jpg"

(Picture credit: AP)

ATHENS: The Venezuelan man convicted of killing Georgia nursing student Laken Riley has been sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in a case that became a flashpoint in the national debate over immigration.Jose Ibarra was charged with murder and other crimes in Riley's February death, and Wednesday's guilty verdict was reached by Athens-Clarke county superior court judge H. Patrick Haggard . Ibarra, 26, had waived his right to a jury trial, meaning Haggard alone heard and decided the case.Haggard found Ibarra guilty of all 10 counts against him: one count of malice murder; three counts of felony murder; and one count each of kidnapping with bodily injury, aggravated assault with intent to rape, aggravated battery, obstructing an emergency call, evidence tampering and being a peeping Tom.Prosecutors said Ibarra encountered Riley while she was running on the University of Georgia campus on Feb 22 and killed her during a struggle. Riley, 22, was a student at Augusta University College of Nursing, which also has a campus in Athens, about 70 miles (115 kilometres) east of Atlanta.Prosecutors decided before trial not to seek the death penalty.Riley's family and friends tearfully remembered her and asked Haggard to sentence Ibarra to the maximum penalty. Her mother, Allyson Phillips , said there is ""no end to the pain, suffering and loss we have experienced and will continue to endure.""""This sick, twisted and evil coward showed no regard for Laken or human life. We are asking that the same be done for him,"" she told the judge.Riley's younger sister, Lauren Phillips, a freshman at the University of Georgia, talked about the pain of living without her ""favourite person"" and ""biggest role model"" and the effect her sister's death has had on her.""I cannot walk around my own college campus because I'm terrified of people like Jose Ibarra,"" she said.Ibarra did not react as an interpreter relayed their words to him, but did appear to be looking at the speakers at times.Defence attorney John Donnelly asked Haggard to give Ibarra two consecutive life sentences but to allow him the eventual possibility of parole.Prosecutor Sheila Ross asked the judge for the maximum sentence, saying Riley's family should never have to worry about Ibarra being released.""You can't bring her back and it's horrible. What you can do is give comfort with your sentence,"" Ross said.Haggard ultimately gave Ibarra the maximum sentence he could impose, including life in prison without the possibility of parole on the malice murder count.Riley's killing added fuel to the national debate over immigration when federal authorities said Ibarra illegally entered the US in 2022 and was allowed to stay in the country while he pursued his immigration case. President-elect Donald Trump and other Republicans blamed Riley's death on the policies of Democratic President Joe Biden.Trump applauded the verdict in a social media post, writing, ""We love you, Laken, and our hearts will always be with you. It is time to secure our Border, and remove these criminals and thugs from our Country, so nothing like this can happen again!""""Laken Riley herself has given you all the evidence you need"" to find Ibarra guilty on all counts, Ross told the judge during her closing. She added that the physical evidence was sufficient and corroborated by forensic, digital and video evidence to ""twist this very powerful knot that this defendant cannot get out of. There is no way out for him.""The evidence shows that Ibarra killed Riley ""because she would not let him rape her.""Ross said Ibarra's DNA was found under Riley's fingernails and her DNA and Ibarra's were found on a jacket that police found in a trash bin in his apartment complex. A man seen in security footage throwing that jacket away was identified as Ibarra by his brother and another roommate, she said.Riley was wearing ""tight running clothes that are designed not to move,"" Ross said. When her body was found, the waistband of her running tights was pulled down and her jacket, shirt and sports bra were pulled up, evidence that her clothes were displaced by an attempted sexual assault not by dragging, Ross said.Surveillance video showed a man wearing clothes that appeared to match those seen in a selfie Ibarra snapped on his phone earlier that morning, lingering outside the apartment of a female graduate student. That student told police someone tried to get in the front door while she was in the shower and peered through her window.Ibarra was ""out prowling and hunting females"" and when he couldn't get in the apartment, he turned to the running trails looking for a victim, Ross said.Defence attorney Kaitlyn Beck told the judge that the evidence was circumstantial and did not definitively prove Ibarra's guilt.""Because the evidence is subject to more than one interpretation, it is not beyond a reasonable doubt,"" she said.Beck tried to cast doubt on a method of DNA testing used to test some of the evidence. She noted that when a fingerprint found on Riley's phone was entered into a database, Ibarra didn't come back as a match and a specialist visually matched the prints.Beck said there was ""doubt based on what was tested and on what was not tested"" because investigators did not test some of the evidence they had gathered.Throughout their questioning of witnesses and in Beck's closing, defence attorneys tried to create doubt about Jose Ibarra's guilt by suggesting that his brother, Diego, could not be excluded as a suspect.The trial began Friday, and prosecutors called more than a dozen law enforcement officers, Riley's roommates and a woman who lived in the same apartment as Ibarra. Defence attorneys called a police officer, a jogger and one of Ibarra's neighbours on Tuesday and rested their case Wednesday morning.","Jose Ibarra was charged with murder and other crimes in Laken Riley's February death.

Darius Paduch, a former doctor in New York, US, was sentenced to life imprisonment on Wednesday after being found guilty of sexually abusing multiple patients, including minors, over more than a decade.As per the news agency AP, the abuse occurred at prestigious hospitals in Manhattan and Long Island, where Paduch exploited his position to prey on vulnerable individuals seeking medical care.Paduch, 57, was convicted in May on charges including inducing individuals and minors to engage in unlawful sexual activity. Eleven victims testified during the trial, and over 300 others have filed allegations and lawsuits against him.Evidence revealed Paduch’s perverse practices, such as assaulting patients during medical exams, using sex toys, and claiming his actions were medically necessary, reported the New York Post.Prosecutors highlighted that Paduch’s misconduct, which began in 2007, continued unabated until 2019. In one instance, he lured a victim to his boat, provided sedatives, and assaulted him. His crimes also included painful and unnecessary medical procedures, leading to further physical and emotional trauma for his victims.""Paduch’s abuse was perverse and pervasive, spanning over a decade and victimising patients both inside and outside hospital rooms,"" said US attorney Damian Williams.Victims’ lawyers hailed the sentencing as a critical step toward justice. Mallory Allen, representing 140 survivors, said, “While no sentence can undo the pain endured, this verdict provides closure and ensures accountability for his horrific acts.”Paduch’s attorney announced plans to appeal the decision, maintaining his client’s innocence.

What is the sexual offence complaint against Pete Hegseth?

Amid reports that Donald Trump 's transition team is quietly looking for an alternative for Pete Hegseth , the defense secretary to-be, Morning Joe host Joe Scarborough confirmed on his show Wednesday that Trump indeed is concerned over the sexual offence allegation against Hegseth. Scarborough and his co-host, wife Mika Brzezinski went to Mar-a-Lago to patch things up with Trump and spoke over a number of issues which they revealed on their Wednesday show.Pete Hegseth is a military veteran and a former Fox News host who was infamous for his problematic opinions. But his record was otherwise clean. After his nomination, it emerged that he paid off a woman in 2017 who accused him of sexual assault. This is not like the allegation against Matt Haetz but the Trump team was caught off guard here and they believe they were not told everything by Hegseth.Joe Scarborough said he and Mika spoke to Donald Trump on the ""shocking"" cabinet picks.“On background—in our conversation, on background—there were a couple of things that surprised us. One of them was, when his name came up, there was, not a flinch, but a noticeable ‘We’ve got problems here,’” Scarborough said on the Wednesday edition of the MSNBC show. “Those weren’t the words, but I will just tell you, that was the takeaway.”“Obviously, everybody knows Gaetz is a problem. But I think there must be more there [with Hegseth], or I think they were just shocked, maybe they were blindsided,” Scarborough said speculating that the lack of vetting process for Hegseth led to more anxiety for Trump's team.Hegseth was accused of sexual assault in 2017 when he spoke at a Republican women's event in Monterey, California. But no charges were filed. Pete Hegseth's lawyer Timothy Parlatore clarified that the sexual encounter was consensual and the woman who made the police complaint was the aggressor. The lawyer said it was true the woman was paid because she blackmailed Hegseth into paying. The payment was made as part of a confidential settlement because Hegset at that time feared that he might lose his Fox News job.","Joe Scarborough said he and Mika spoke to Donald Trump on the ""shocking"" cabinet picks.

Former President Donald Trump and former National Security Advisor John Bolton.

Could Her Nomination Be Scuttled?



President-elect Donald Trump’s decision to nominate former Democratic Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard as Director of National Intelligence has reignited controversy surrounding her ties to a controversial religious sect, the Science of Identity Foundation (SIF). These connections, described as problematic and potentially cult-like, are now under intense scrutiny and could jeopardize her Senate confirmation .Tulsi Gabbard made history in 2013 when she became the first American Samoan and practicing Hindu elected to Congress, representing Hawaii’s 2nd Congressional District. Known for her unorthodox political positions, she often defied party norms during her tenure. Gabbard’s political career and personal life, including her marriage to cinematographer Abraham Williams, are reportedly interwoven with the influence of the Science of Identity Foundation—a group led by Chris Butler , who is revered by followers as a near-divine figure.The Science of Identity Foundation is a religious organization often described as an offshoot of the Hare Krishna movement, with a controversial history. Founded by Chris Butler, also known as Jagad Guru Siddhaswarupananda Paramahamsa, the group has thousands of followers in Hawaii, Australia, New Zealand, and Southeast Asia. Butler’s teachings blend traditional Hindu philosophy with a rigid hierarchy of devotion to him as a spiritual leader.Former members and critics describe the group as cult-like, citing its authoritarian structure and allegations of intolerance toward LGBTQ individuals, women, and Muslims. Members reportedly view Butler as an extension of God, and questioning his authority is seen as a spiritual offense. Critics, including some former followers, accuse the group of fostering a climate of fear and control.The Science of Identity Foundation (SIF) gained renewed media attention around 2020 when some commentators highlighted Tulsi Gabbard's childhood association with the group. Gabbard, a candidate for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 United States presidential election (and now Trump's pick to be DNI), reportedly referred to Chris Butler, the leader of SIF, as her spiritual guide during her school years. Her father, Mike Gabbard, a Hawaii State Senator, has also been linked to SIF and is known for his opposition to same-sex marriage, framing spirituality as a tool against sexual practices SIF considers ""deviant."" Gabbard’s mother, Carol Gabbard, served as the organisation’s treasurer.Gabbard has openly referred to Butler as her spiritual guide or “guru.” Her ties to the organization reportedly date back to her upbringing, with her family deeply embedded in its structure. Gabbard’s aunt, Dr Caroline Sinavaiana Gabbard, has been outspoken about the group’s influence on her niece, calling her involvement with Butler troubling and accusing him of orchestrating her political ascent to increase his own influence.Critics allege that Butler played a significant role in Gabbard’s 2020 presidential campaign, which some saw as an effort to gain a foothold in national politics. Gabbard’s critics have raised concerns about how her affiliation with a fringe religious group might influence her decision-making in a high-level intelligence position.Tulsi Gabbard has since clarified that during her school years, she regarded Butler as ""essentially like a Vaishnava Hindu pastor."" As a teenager, she distanced herself from SIF, fully embracing Hinduism and aligning herself with the Vaishnava tradition, which centres on devotion to the Supreme Lord. Gabbard identifies as a Vaishnava Hindu and frequently participates in Hindu festivals, such as Diwali, alongside Hindu-American communities.The nomination of Gabbard to a critical intelligence role has drawn widespread criticism, with figures from both political parties questioning her qualifications and fitness for the job. Former National Security Advisor John Bolton labeled her the ""worst cabinet-level appointment in history,"" citing both her ties to the SIF and her controversial foreign policy positions, such as her perceived closeness to authoritarian figures like Vladimir Putin.The resurfacing of her connections to the SIF has compounded these criticisms. Some senators are reportedly uneasy about her ability to serve as Director of National Intelligence without bias or undue influence. A former intelligence official described the nomination as a “left turn and off the bridge,” reflecting the broader skepticism within the intelligence community.The Senate confirmation process will likely spotlight Gabbard’s ties to the SIF and her broader political allegiances. While her supporters argue that her religious beliefs should not disqualify her from public office, detractors point to the SIF’s controversial history and Butler’s influence as disqualifying factors.

Gaetz paid for sex from Nestor's PayPal: Report



Donald Trump's attorney general pick Matt Gaetz is on the radar as he is one of the most controversial picks so far and many Republicans are hopeful that he won't become the AG as he won't get confirmed by the Senate. He was under investigation for having sex with a 17-year-old and paying for the sex. The House ethics committee report against him was to be published but he resigned from Congress after his nomination making himself outside the purview of the committee.Now it has emerged that 42-year-old Gaetz has an adopted son Nestor whom he did not hide from the world.

Barron is a US citizen and Trump's immigration policy won't impact him

Ending birthright citizenship has always been President-elect Donald Trump's plan -- ensnared in controversies as this arises from the Constitution's 14th Amendment. After he won the election, a claim went viral that his youngest son Barron Trump will also be not considered a US citizen under his policy as Melania Trump became a US citizen three months after Barron's birth.The 14th Amendment granted citizenship to all persons ""born or naturalized in the United States"" including formerly enslaved people and has been interpreted to apply whether or not parents were in the country legally.But the claim regarding Barron is fake as Barron's father Donald Trump was a lawful permanent resident when Barron was born and Donald Trump's executive order planned for the first day of his second term in office requires at least one parent to be an American citizen or lawful permanent resident for their children to become automatic US citizens.Melania came to the US in 1996 for modelling work. Melania and Donald Trump got married in 2005 and Barron Trump was born in March 2006. Melania became a citizen of the United States in July 2006. So it is true that Melania was not a US citizen when Barron was born.But Melania Trump was not an illegal resident either. She received an Einstein visa in 2001.Trump said his order on birthright citizenship would not be retroactive. It will impact only the children born after it takes effect. Also, if one parent is a green card holder, then the child becomes a US citizen.Barron Trump has remained under the limelight this election campaign because he made his debut in his father's campaign and also advised him on which podcasts to go to reach the maximum young audience. This was also the first time Barron voted.","Barron is a US citizen and Trump's immigration policy won't impact him.

The video has gone viral amid outrage over Donald Trump's cabinet picks -- and Pete Hegseth is one of the outrageous picks.Pete Hegseth has three wives and seven children and has recently been accused of a sexual misconduct allegation -- though his lawyer said it was a consensual thing but Hegseth was coerced into paying the woman during the #MeToo movement.

Matt Gaetz, Trump's pick for attorney general, is also embroiled in a sex offence case but it was widely known and now Trump is throwing his weight behind Gaetz. But Hegseth's case is different.“People are upset about the distraction. The general feeling is Pete hasn’t been honest,” a source told Vanity Fair.But his hand-washing video remains evergreen.On the Fox News panel, Pete Hegseth in 2019 admitted that he ate a day-old pizza which was not in a refrigerator. He said he didn't find anything odd about that. ""Really, I don't really wash my hands ever. I inoculate myself. Germs are not a real thing. I can't see them, therefore they're not real,"" Hegseth said evoking laughter. He later clarified that he was joking but he said he supported drinking from hosepipe and riding bikes without a helmet. Those posts on his X have been deleted.Pete Hegseth is aware of the uphill task in front of him as he will have to be cleared by the Senate to become the defense secretary.

It came a day after four people, including a tribal chief and a woman, were killed and as many injured when unknown armed men opened fire on a vehicle in Bannu.The latest attack, according to the army’s handout, triggered an exchange of fire in which six terrorists were gunned down and the attempt to enter the post effectively thwarted by troops, forcing the terrorists to detonate an explosives-laden vehicle at the post’s perimeter wall. “The suicide blast led to the collapse of a portion of the perimeter wall and damaged the adjoining infrastructure, as a result of which 12 soldiers lost their lives,” the statement added.There has been a sharp rise in the number of attacks targeting security forces, other law enforcement agencies, and security checkpoints, particularly in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Bannu has seen heightened militant violence of late, including the abductions of cops, attack on a prison, attack on a girls’ school, and shootouts that have left several security officials dead.On Monday, over half a dozen policemen were abducted from a checkpost in an adjacent North Waziristan tribal district. They were later recovered by police, with the help of tribal elders.Over the weekend at least eight security personnel were killed and three injured in fierce gun battles with militants in Tirah valley of Khyber tribal district, bordering Afghanistan.On Saturday, at least seven security officials were killed and 18 others wounded in Baluchistan’s Kalat region in a pre-dawn terrorist attack on a checkpost.

It, however, did not give any details about when the military operation would be launched and in which parts of the province.Restive Balochistan, Pakistan’s biggest province by area but poor in terms of development, has been home to a nearly two-decade-old insurgency by separatist militant groups of ethnic Baloch nationals who carry out frequent attacks against the govt, army, and Chinese interests in the region. The insurgents say they are fighting what they see as unfair exploitation of the province’s mineral and gas wealth by the federation at the centre.Pakistan’s govt and military deny the charge that they are exploiting Balochistan’s resources and have long been blaming neighbouring India, Afghanistan, and Iran for fomenting trouble in the province.Thousands of Chinese nationals are currently stationed in Pakistan working on Beijing’s investment projects, such as a strategic port, economic zones, road and infrastructure, and gold and copper mine projects, under the banner of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), part of Beijing’s multi-billion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative. The CPEC aims to connect China’s northern Xinjiang province with Pakistan’s port city of Gwadar, Balochistan. Since Beijing launched its projects in Pakistan a decade ago, nearly two dozen of its citizens have been killed in terrorist attacks in Pakistan.",The surge in attacks in the province had prompted Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to summon a high-profile meeting of civil and military officials in Islamabad.

He also decried the “enforced disappearances, brutality, and violence” against PTI workers.Khan’s statement followed his wife Bushra Bibi’s recent warning to PTI politicians about tickets for the next general election. “The party tickets for the next general elections are linked with the performance of the PTI leadership during the upcoming protest in Islamabad,” she said, describing it as Imran’s message to the party leadership.On Monday, PTI had announced it would not end its sit-in until its stolen mandate was returned, the constitution restored, and Imran set free.","Khan urges everyone to join the protest on November 24. “The nation will not accept any excuse at such a critical time,” he said.

Extortions bleed Pak’s terror-stalked northwest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/extortions-bleed-paks-terror-stalked-northwest/articleshow/115454371.cms,"TOI

ISLAMABAD: Surging terror and extortions have endangered public safety in Pakistan ’s restive northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where militants in several districts run a parallel shadow administration.The southern districts of the province have almost become no-go areas even for law-enforcers. In the evening, militants are seen patrolling the streets and setting up checkpoints in Bannu, North and South Waziristan, Tank, Lakki Marwat, and Dera Ismail Khan regions.While these districts remain at mercy of militants from evening to morning, well-off people in other districts of the province frequently receive threatening WhatsApp texts and letters from Pakistani Taliban -- or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) -- with demands to pay or face attacks. The ones who refuse to pay ransom are often targeted with grenade attacks at their homes, shops and warehouses, apparently to show the group was serious about its threats.Faisal Khan, a lawyer in Umerzai area in Charsadda district, toldthat he had received a threatening WhatsApp text earlier this month from an Afghanistan number with a demand to pay $50,000 (Pak Rs 1.4cr).Khan claims that after reporting the threats to the police, he went to high-ranking officers to request protection and assistance. Most official discussions, he said, concluded with cautious assurances.“A family goes through pain for months after such a call. Even after approaching the cops, the victims are normally asked to install CCTV cameras, restrict movement and take care of security themselves,” Khan said. He also revealed that he was cautioned by “allies in the govt” that he “should not count” on them to keep him safe. “Either pay up or move your family to Islamabad or Lahore,” he said in reference to a private communication with some officials after he pressed for assistance.Last week, Khan said he had received a parcel carrying a shroud and other items required before burials. “This was followed by a threatening message to vacate my home within 30 minutes,” Khan said, adding he has refused to pay the extortioners.However, Shahzaib, another person in the same neighbourhood who had received a similar text on TTP’s letterhead last month, has paid after negotiating a deal through intermediaries. He eventually paid a reduced part of the $50,000 the militants initially demanded.“The key thing I learnt was that TTP is demanding extortion from everyone they think can pay. Most, if not all, wealthy individuals have already paid,” Shahzaib said.According to police, the main hurdle for law-enforcers in tracking down extortionists is the calls which they make from non-local lines, internet-generated resources, illegal gateways and Whatsapp numbers.Apart from various groups, the police said, criminal rings are also found involved in many such calls. In the last two years, police sources said at least 1,600 Afghan phone numbers and 387 illegal gateways were used for making extortion calls. These numbers and illegal gateways, according to the police, have been shared with higher authorities for follow-up action. “Despite the alarming increase in Taliban extortion demands, the issue has yet to attract national attention,” a senior police official said.","The southern districts of the province have almost become no-go areas even for law-enforcers.

Eight soldiers were killed and seven police officers abducted in separate incidents in northwest Pakistan on Tuesday, officials told news agency AFP.

Just last week, seven paramilitary soldiers were killed in an attack by Baloch separatists on a border post in Balochistan province . The same group, the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), was responsible for a deadly railway station bombing earlier this year that killed 26 people, including 14 soldiers.Militant groups like the BLA and the Pakistani Taliban frequently target security forces and infrastructure, claiming to fight for autonomy or ideological goals. Their activities have disrupted economic projects, particularly those involving foreign investment, such as Chinese-backed ventures in Balochistan.Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has condemned these attacks, vowing swift action against the perpetrators.","Pakistani Taliban claims responsibility for two attacks in northwest Pakistan.
