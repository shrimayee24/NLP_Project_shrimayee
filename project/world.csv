J&K: Kathua search covers new areas after terrorist fire,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jk-kathua-search-covers-new-areas-after-terrorist-fire/articleshow/119883171.cms,"Security forces in Jammu and Kashmir's Kathua district engaged in a gunfight while pursuing Pakistani terrorists, following an earlier clash that resulted in casualties. Searches intensified in the Ramkote area with drones and sniffer dogs. Several villagers are suspected of aiding the infiltrators.

JAMMU: A brief gunfight was reported as security forces pursued Pakistani terrorists in new areas of J&K’s Kathua district, following last Thursday’s gunfight in Sufain forests that left four policemen dead. Two terrorists were also killed, but at least three of them managed to escape.In Poonch district, a series of landmine blasts occurred in Krishna Ghati sector Tuesday. “No loss of life or injury reported so far,” an official said. The area has an anti-infiltration obstacle system, with landmines that sometimes get washed away by rain and triggered by cattle or human movement.The forces intensified search operations and laid a cordon in the forested Panjtirthi area of Ramkote in Kathua after gunfire erupted Monday night, officials said Tuesday. Police received intelligence about the presence of three armed men in the area.“The firing has stopped. A cordon was put up to stop the terrorists from escaping,” an official said.They are believed to be the same men spotted in combat clothing in Ghati-Juthana forest Monday, just a few km from the site in Sufain. According to officials, the fugitives are constantly on the move, taking advantage of the mountainous terrain’s natural hiding spots, including caves and dense forests.The forces have deployed drones for aerial surveillance, while sniffer dogs are assisting joint teams from Army, police, NSG, CRPF, and BSF in the search.Police have detained six members of a jailed “overground” worker of terrorists on suspicion of aiding the armed Pakistani infiltrators in hiding and navigating the area undetected.According to sources, many people from remote villages may be coerced or financially incentivised to assist the terrorists — such as knowledge of the terrain and resources, enabling the intruders to evade security forces and carry out attacks in the challenging landscape.","Security forces in Jammu and Kashmir's Kathua district engaged in a gunfight while pursuing Pakistani terrorists.

'Not joking': Why Donald Trump is repeatedly talking about a third term,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/not-joking-why-donald-trump-is-repeatedly-talking-about-a-third-term/articleshow/119872811.cms,"Why it matters

This isn’t just about ego or political theatre. Trump’s repeated third-term teases fit a pattern seen in countries where leaders dismantle democratic norms to hold on to power. From Russia to China to Turkey, term limits have become mere suggestions — and Trump, who’s already bent many American norms, appears intrigued by that model.

He’s long admired authoritarian leaders , from Vladimir Putin to China’s Xi Jinping to Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman . All have one thing in common: they’ve either abolished term limits or rule with no real political competition.

, from to China’s to Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince . All have one thing in common: they’ve either abolished term limits or rule with no real political competition. As Trump himself once said of Xi, “He’s now president for life... maybe we’ll have to give that a shot someday.”

The big picture

Trump’s fascination with authoritarian strongmen isn’t new. But in the context of a second term where he’s already consolidating power, weakening institutional resistance, and facing no internal GOP challenge, his third-term talk hits differently.

Putin sidestepped term limits by becoming prime minister before returning to the presidency and later rewrote the rules entirely.

Xi amended China’s constitution in 2018 to remove the two-term limit, clearing the way to rule indefinitely.

Erdogan in Turkey used constitutional changes and a new presidential system to entrench power.

Orbán in Hungary has manipulated courts and elections to turn a democracy into a one-party state in all but name.

Trump isn’t hiding his admiration. He calls them “tough” and “smart” and frequently contrasts their power with what he claims are the shackles of American democracy.

What they’re saying

“There are methods by which you could do it, as you know,” Trump told NBC. He did not elaborate. “I’m not joking.”

“Don’t underestimate Donald Trump’s willingness not only to socialize the unthinkable in American politics but actually to act on it,” said Susan Glasser, New Yorker journalist and author on Putin.

“It reads like somebody who doesn’t want to be treated like a lame duck,” said Derek Muller, Notre Dame law professor.

Even some Republicans are publicly brushing off the idea. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Trump was “probably having some fun with it.” Others, like Rep. Andy Ogles (R-TN), are taking steps — proposing a constitutional amendment to allow non-consecutive three-term presidencies, tailored specifically to Trump.

Look, you guys continue to ask the president this question about a third term, and then he answers honestly and candidly with a smile, and then everybody here melts down about his answer. “It’s not really something we’re thinking about. He has four years. There’s a lot of work to do. We’ve done a lot, nearly for 100 days. And the American people love what this president is doing. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary

Floating the impossible, freezing the field

The authoritarian playbook

The impulse to cling to power is not unique to Trump. What’s more concerning is how familiar his behavior has become, a CNN report said.

Susan Glasser, a New Yorker writer and Putin biographer, called it “socializing the unthinkable”—pushing past norms until the impossible starts to feel plausible. This is how authoritarianism creeps in: not with coups, but with drift.

Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, once seen as a European reformer, turned his democracy into a one-party state through a mix of legal manipulation, court-packing, and media intimidation. Trump has praised Orbán too.

The American system has guardrails. But guardrails don’t matter if they’re not enforced—and Trump has spent much of his time in office weakening those very institutions that could stop him. He’s attacked the judiciary, threatened universities, punished law firms that oppose him, and floated executive orders to federalize election oversight.

The destruction of the civil service is already under way, pressure on the press and universities has begun, and thoughts of changing the Constitution are in the air... America is spinning quickly in the direction of Hungarian populism, Hungarian politics, and Hungarian justice. But that means Hungarian stagnation, Hungarian corruption, and Hungarian poverty lie in our future too. Anne Applebaum in Atlantic in an article titled 'America’s Future Is Hungary'

The legal reality

The Constitution’s 22nd Amendment is unambiguous: “No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.”

As per a WSJ report, Trump’s allies have floated workarounds: running as VP and then taking over, serving as Speaker and ascending through resignations — but constitutional scholars say none of those hold up.

The 12th Amendment blocks anyone ineligible for the presidency from being vice president.

A constitutional amendment to allow a third term would require two-thirds support in Congress and ratification by 38 states — mathematically out of reach in today’s polarized climate.

Still, Trump doesn’t have to succeed legally to win politically. As he’s shown repeatedly, the spectacle is often the point.

What’s next

US President Donald Trump has openly mused about serving a third term, brushing off the 22nd Amendment’s clear prohibition and declaring recently, “I’m not joking.” In an NBC interview, he even hinted at unspecified “methods” that could allow him to stay in power beyond 2029.While Trump has often used provocations to troll critics or dominate headlines, this time feels different. He sounds serious — and that has legal scholars, political strategists, and democracy advocates paying attention.It’s a pattern Trump has refined over years in public life. Say the outrageous. Let the media chase it. Watch his rivals squirm. The more he repeats the idea of a third term, the more it does exactly what he wants: it keeps Republican challengers at bay, distracts from scandals, and re-centers himself in the political universe.“It reads like somebody who doesn’t want to be treated like a lame duck,” Derek Muller, a constitutional law professor at Notre Dame, told the NYT. And he’s right. For Trump, “lame duck” is a fate worse than losing. It means losing the spotlight, the leverage, the illusion of inevitability.By teasing the idea of sticking around past 2029, Trump discourages potential successors from gaining momentum. Noem, DeSantis, Vance—why take the risk of running a national campaign when Trump might simply decide he’s not done?As per a NYT report, this strategy was laid bare when Trump’s musings coincided with a news cycle dominated by an embarrassing leak: top Trump advisers had accidentally included a journalist in a private Signal chat discussing a military operation. The media was primed to dig into the implications. Instead, the oxygen shifted to a new circus: What if Trump runs again?What seemed laughable in 2016 is now a live national conversation. If Trump can convince millions of Americans that the Constitution is flexible, that the presidency is his birthright, and that elections are optional — then the third term may not need to be legal. It just needs to be normalized.“You won’t have to vote anymore,” Trump once said at a rally. “It will be fixed.” That line — half-laugh, half-threat — may say more about his third-term ambitions than any formal plan ever could.Trump will likely continue teasing a third term, both to rally his base and to maintain his dominance over a distracted political class. His allies, like Steve Bannon, hint they’re “working on” legal avenues — despite the overwhelming constitutional roadblocks.“A man like this comes along once every century,” Bannon told NewsNation. “We’re working on it... a couple of alternatives.”Whether serious or symbolic, the implications are real for American democracy.(With inputs from agencies)","Trump’s fascination with authoritarian strongmen isn’t new.

MOHALI: A Punjab court on Tuesday sentenced self-proclaimed Christian pastor Bajinder Singh to life imprisonment in a 2018 rape case. The verdict was delivered by aditional district and session judge Vikrant Kumar, Mohali.Singh, often referred to as the 'Yeshu Yeshu prophet,' was convicted for sexually assaulting a woman from Zirakpur.The court of Additional District and Sessions Judge (ADSJ) Vikrant Kumar pronounced the verdict, finding him guilty on March 28 under IPC sections 376 (rape), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), and 506 (criminal intimidation).The special judge's court sentenced Pastor Bajinder under sections 376, 323, and 506, leading to his immediate custody and transfer to Patiala Jail.The court acquitted the remaining accused—Akbar Bhatti, Rajesh Chaudhary, Jatinder Kumar, Sitar Ali, and Sandeep alias Pehlwan—due to a lack of evidence, while another accused, Sucha Singh, died during the trial. Many supporters of Pastor Bajinder gathered outside the court complex, but police prevented them from entering.According to case reports, the Zirakpur police registered a case against Pastor Bajinder Singh and six other accused, including Akbar Bhatti, Rajesh Chaudhary, Sucha Singh, Jatinder Kumar, Sitar Ali, and Sandeep alias Pehlwan, based on a victim's complaint.

There, he told her he was traveling to the UK soon and promised to take her along.Under the pretence of facilitating her travel abroad, he allegedly established physical relations with her against her will and recorded an obscene video after rendering her unconscious.Subsequently, Pastor Bajinder demanded a large sum of money for the overseas trip, threatening to leak the video if she failed to comply.

Read Ashley St. Clair reply here



Elon, we asked you to confirm paternity through a test before our child (who you named) was even born. You refused.

And you weren’t sending *me* money, you were sending support for your child that you thought was necessary… until you withdrew most of it to maintain control and punish me for “disobedience.” But you’re really only punishing your son

It’s ironic that your last effort in court was to try to gag me while you use a social media channel you literally own to distribute derogatory messages about me and our child to the entire world. It’s all about control with you, and everyone can see it.

America needs you to grow up, you petulant man-child.

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has publicly addressed claims made by conservative influencer Ashley St. Clair that he fathered her child.

""I don’t know if the child is mine or not, but am not against finding out. No court order is needed,"" Musk wrote in his post.St. Clair, however, refuted Musk's claims, stating that he had previously refused to take a paternity test before the child was born.

""You weren’t sendingmoney, you were sending support for your child that you thought was necessary… until you withdrew most of it to maintain control and punish me for disobedience,"" St. Clair responded on X.The feud has drawn significant public attention, with St. Clair alleging that Musk has had minimal involvement in the child's upbringing and has only met the infant three times.

TAIPEI: China's military said it practised hitting key ports and energy sites during ""live-fire"" drills Wednesday as part of exercises aimed at Taiwan, the democratic island it claims as its own.The surprise manoeuvres were criticised by Washington as ""intimidation tactics"" and come after Taiwan President Lai Ching-te called China a ""foreign hostile force"".Named "" Strait Thunder-2025A "", the drills are located in the middle and southern parts of the strait, the military said, which is a vital artery for global shipping.The military said it held ""long-range live-fire drills"" and practised hitting ""simulated targets of key ports and energy facilities"" during the exercises.Wednesday's exercises aim to ""test the troops' capabilities"" in areas such as ""blockade and control, and precision strikes on key targets"", said Senior Colonel Shi Yi, spokesman of the Chinese military's Eastern Theater Command.Taiwan's defence ministry confirmed China's military drills were ongoing but did not elaborate.Taiwan is a potential flashpoint between China and the United States, which is the island's most important security partner.The US State Department said Beijing's ""aggressive"" military activities and rhetoric towards Taiwan ""only serve to exacerbate tensions and put the region's security and the world's prosperity at risk"".Chinese leaders vigorously oppose Washington's support for Taiwan and detest Lai, who they call a ""separatist"".Drills in the strait come a day after China sent its army, navy, air and rocket forces to surround Taiwan for exercises Beijing said were aimed at practising for ""precision strikes"" and a blockade of the island.That prompted Taipei to dispatch its own air and maritime forces as part of a ""Rapid Response Exercise"".Taiwan's defence ministry said Tuesday China had deployed 21 warships around the island, including the Shandong aircraft carrier group, along with 71 aircraft and four coast guard vessels.That was the highest number of warships detected during a single day in nearly a year, and the most aircraft since October 2024.- 'Robust' deterrence -Beijing has increased the deployment of fighter jets and naval vessels around Taiwan in recent years to press its claim of sovereignty, which Taipei rejects.Tensions between Taipei and Beijing have escalated since Lai took office in May 2024 and adopted tougher rhetoric than his predecessor Tsai Ing-wen in defending the island's sovereignty.While Taiwan sees itself as a sovereign country, only 11 mostly Pacific and Caribbean countries and the Vatican recognise its claim to statehood.Last month, Lai called China a ""foreign hostile force"" and proposed measures to combat growing Chinese espionage and infiltration, angering Beijing.US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth vowed ""robust, ready and credible deterrence"" in the strait during a visit to the region last week.Taipei analyst Wen-Ti Sung said China was using ""stress test after stress test"" to gauge the strength of US President Donald Trump's support for Taiwan and other allies in the region.The United States is legally bound to provide arms to Taiwan, but Washington has long maintained ""strategic ambiguity"" when it comes to whether it would deploy its military to defend the island from a Chinese attack.China has carried out several large-scale exercises around the island in recent years, often described as rehearsals for a blockade and seizure of the territory.Analysts have speculated that China was more likely to attempt a blockade of Taiwan than launch an all-out invasion, which was riskier and would require a huge military deployment.The dispute between China and Taiwan dates back to 1949 when Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang nationalist forces fled to Taiwan after losing the Chinese civil war with Mao Zedong's communist fighters.While Taiwan has never declared formal independence, Lai and Tsai, who both belong to the Democratic Progressive Party, share the position that Taiwan is ""already independent"".","China's military said it practised hitting key ports and energy sites during ""live-fire"" drills.

Bangladesh says NYT report claiming rise in Islamist extremism 'misleading',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-says-nyt-report-claiming-rise-in-islamist-extremism-misleading/articleshow/119889808.cms,"Bangladesh has strongly refuted a New York Times report claiming a rise in Islamist extremism. Chief adviser Muhammad Yunus's press secretary criticized the report for oversimplifying the country's political and social dynamics, emphasizing the significant progress made over the past year while recognizing the presence of hardliners.

DHAKA: Bangladesh has dismissed as ""misleading"" an NYT report, which claimed that while the country works to rebuild its democracy and shape a new future for its 175 million people, a ""streak of Islamist extremism"" that had been hidden beneath its secular surface is now emerging.Chief adviser Muhammad Yunus's press secretary Shafiqul Alam said the article, titled 'As Bangladesh Reinvents Itself, Islamist Hard-Liners See an Opening' paints a one-sided view of the country. Alam said this portrayal not only oversimplifies the political and social dynamics of the country but also risks unfairly smearing an entire nation. ""It is crucial to acknowledge the progress Bangladesh has made over the last year and the complexity of the situation, rather than relying on selective, incendiary examples that paint an inaccurate picture.""In the vacuum that has emerged after the overthrow of ""authoritarian leader (Sheikh Hasina)"", fundamentalists in one town declared young women could no longer play soccer, says the NYT report. In another, they forced police to free a man who had harassed a woman for not covering her hair in public, the article said. ""Demonstrators at a rally in Dhaka, the capital, warned that if the govt did not give the death penalty to anyone who disrespected Islam, they would carry out executions with their own hands. Days later, an outlawed group held a march demanding an Islamic caliphate."" In interviews with NYT, members of Islamist parties and outfits - some of which had previously been banned - made clear they were working to push Bangladesh in a more fundamentalist direction.

On Monday night, senior members of key republican parties met to coordinate a joint response, vowing to defend the federal democratic system from what they described as an ""organised attempt to dismantle it"".Speaking in parliament earlier on Monday, PM K P Sharma Oli accused Gyanendra of directly instigating the unrest. ""Even former king Gyanendra Shah cannot escape responsibility for this violence. Those who say they will become king again and destroy the system - should they not make their views public on these incidents?"" Oli said Gyanendra had met with protest organisers, including controversial figures Durga Prasai and Navaraj Subedi, at Nirmal Niwas - Gyanendra's private residence in Kathmandu - a day before Friday's demonstration. ""These activities will not be tolerated, and strict action will be taken,"" Oli said, referencing a video message released by Gyanendra on Nepal's Democracy Day (Feb 19) that he claimed incited royalist sentiments.In the video, Gyanendra said he had abdicated ""in the greater interest of the country and the people"", calling it ""a sacrifice, not a weakness"". ""Democracy today exists more in words than in practice,"" he said, citing economic hardship, youth migration and a crisis in education. Urging national unity, he called on citizens to ""correct past mistakes"" and added, ""I am ready to make any sacrifice for the country"".

Randy Fine’s Florida victory: Why it’s a big deal for Trump and the GOP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/randy-fines-florida-victory-why-its-a-big-deal-for-trump-and-the-gop/articleshow/119889014.cms,"Randy Fine (File photo)

Republican Randy Fine secured victory over Democrat Josh Weil in Tuesday’s special election for a US House of Representatives seat in northern Florida, delivering a crucial win for President Donald Trump and the GOP amid their slim majority in Congress. The race was called in Fine’s favor just 30 minutes after polls closed in the solidly Republican district.Fine’s victory ensures that the GOP maintains its narrow control in the House, where Republicans hold a delicate 218-213 majority. The seat had been left vacant after Mike Waltz, who previously represented Florida’s sixth congressional district, was appointed by Trump to serve as the national security advisor. The district, known for its conservative lean, includes areas like Daytona Beach and the Ocala National Forest.Despite concerns from Republican officials about his lackluster fundraising, Fine managed to overcome the challenge. His Democratic opponent, Weil, had amassed nearly $10 million for his campaign by the final weeks, far surpassing Fine’s fundraising total, which remained under $1 million, according to Federal Election Commission filings.Even Trump, speaking at the White House last week, admitted uncertainty about the race’s outcome. However, Fine benefited from Trump’s direct political backing, including a telerally where the president urged voters to support the Republican candidate.A longtime figure in Florida politics , Fine has been known for his outspoken views. According to The Floridian, he has previously advocated for expelling ""any non-Americans who are or have advocated for Muslim terror."" He has also clashed with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, accusing him in 2023 of failing to adequately address antisemitism.Fine has served in the Florida state legislature since 2016, most recently winning a seat in the state Senate. Following his congressional victory, he has resigned from his position in the state legislature to prepare for his role in Washington.","Republican Randy Fine won a special election for a US House of Representatives seat in northern Florida.

Ranjani Srinivasan: 'I want my PhD.

'I am not pro-Hamas'

Indian scholar Ranjani Srinivasan , a Columbia student, who fled to Canada to escape arrest by the feds said she still hopes she would get back to the PhD course as it is almost at the fag end and if now Columbia does not take her back, the last five years of her life would mean nothing, a complete waste, she told in an interview with CNN.Ranjani hit the headlines soon after another Columbia student Mahmoud Khalil's arrest -- as Department of Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem posted a video of Srinivasan leaving the country. Noem claimed Srinivasan self-deported herself using the CBP Home app, which Srinivasan dismissed and said she did not use that app as that was not her phone. She said she just booked a flight to Canada and left the country -- though till date she is clueless why ICE agents came looking for her.“It is a privilege to be granted a visa to live & study in the United States of America. When you advocate for violence and terrorism that privilege should be revoked and you should not be in this country. I’m glad to see one of the Columbia University terrorist sympathizers use the CBP Home app to self deport,"" Kristi Noem said.Ranjani told CNN that she was not active in politics. “I’m not a terrorist sympathizer, I’m not a pro-Hamas activist. I’m just literally a random student … It just seems very strange that they would spend so much, vast resources, in persecuting me.” She was to complete her PhD in May and now hopes that Columbia can reenroll her somehow.Srinivasan's visa was revoked, following which Columbia revoked her registration because her student visa was revoked. Srinivasan was issued two summonses for participating in a pro-Hamas rally but those were dismissed as she did not participate in those but was caught in the rally as she was coming back home. Her visa was revoked because she did not reveal these two summonses to the authorities though she said did not know that she had to tell the authorities about those issues which were not valid anymore.“I do think that Columbia should have protected me against this. I think that that’s part of their mandate,” Srinivasan said. “When you’re attracting these international students to come and study at Columbia, when you go and do outreach all across the world to attract the best and the brightest, you have a mandate to protect them.”“I want my PhD. I want my name cleared,"" Srinivasan said these are her only two goals now.","Ranjani Srinivasan said she hopes Columbia would take her back and her five years of PhD work won't go to waste.

Jayanta ‘Jay’ Bhattacharya took office on Tuesday as the 18th director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). President Donald Trump nominated Dr Bhattacharya for the position on November 26, 2024, and the US Senate confirmed him on March 25, 2025.As director, Dr Bhattacharya will oversee America’s medical research agency, according to a news release from NIH. “Dr Bhattacharya will play an instrumental role in shaping the agency’s activities and outlook and ensuring they align with the president’s Make America Healthy Again Commission.”“Under Dr Bhattacharya’s leadership, NIH will restore its commitment to gold-standard science,” said US Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. “I’m excited to work with Dr Bhattacharya to ensure NIH research aligns with our administration’s priorities — especially tackling the chronic disease epidemic and helping to Make America Healthy Again.”“Chronic diseases such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes and obesity continue to cause poor health outcomes in every community across the United States. Novel biomedical discoveries that enhance health and lengthen life are more vital than ever to our country’s future,” said Dr Bhattacharya. “As NIH Director , I will build on the agency’s long and illustrious history of supporting breakthroughs in biology and medicine by fostering gold-standard research and innovation to address the chronic disease crisis.”A renowned doctor, researcher and health economist, Dr Bhattacharya held a tenured professorship in the medical school at Stanford University in California. His research has focused on population aging and chronic disease, particularly on the health and well-being of vulnerable populations. During the pandemic, Dr Bhattacharya co-authored the Great Barrington Declaration, which called for opening schools and lifting lockdowns while better protecting older populations who were most vulnerable to the disease.Encouraging different perspectives will be central to Dr Bhattacharya’s approach to leading NIH as part of his larger mission to restore public trust in science. Alongside Secretary Kennedy, he will champion innovative, cutting-edge research that fuels near-term solutions for patients while balancing investments in basic science.Dr Bhattacharya earned his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in economics from Stanford University.

LIVE: Democratic-backed Susan Crawford wins Wisconsin Supreme Court seat

Susan Crawford , a Dane County judge known for her legal battles defending union rights, abortion access, and opposing voter ID laws, defeated Elon Musk-backed Brad Schimel in a record-breaking Supreme Court election.Crawford's win is being considered crucial in preserving the liberal majority on the state’s court in a key battleground state, where Crawford’s supporters worked to frame the election as a referendum on Elon Musk , a close Trump ally, who contributed millions of his personal wealth to Schimel’s campaign.This made the race the most expensive judicial contest in US history, further intensifying its national significance.Crawford defeated conservative judge Brad Schimel from Waukesha County, who was supported by Trump in the final stretch of the race. While the race was officially nonpartisan, the outcome is being viewed as a key victory for Democrats both in Wisconsin and nationally, marking the first major political challenge of the second Trump era and ending in defeat for the president’s preferred candidate.Wisconsin’s largest city saw unprecedented voter turnout on Tuesday, leading to ballot shortages as residents headed to the polls in record numbers to vote in a high-stakes Supreme Court race. This election, which featured one candidate backed by President Donald Trump and another supported by Democrats, set the stage for what could be the highest-turnout Wisconsin Supreme Court race in history.The contest, a proxy battle for the nation’s political divisions, shattered spending records and became a focal point for national political battles. On one side, Republicans, including Trump and the world's richest individual, Elon Musk, supported Brad Schimel, the former state attorney general. On the other, Democrats, including former President Barack Obama and billionaire George Soros, rallied behind Susan Crawford, a Dane County judge known for her legal challenges to defend union power, abortion rights, and fight against voter ID laws.This election was viewed as a critical test of public sentiment regarding Trump’s first few months in office, as well as the influence of Musk and his controversial Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has been central to his cost-cutting initiatives. Musk even visited Wisconsin on Sunday to support Schimel, making waves by personally handing out $1 million checks to two voters.","Susan Crawford, a Dane County judge known for her legal battles defending union rights, abortion access, and opposing voter ID laws, defeated Elon Musk-backed Brad Schimel in a record-breaking Supreme Court election.

Cory Booker delivers marathon speech on Senate floor | CBS News

Cory Booker ends record-breaking Senate speech with tribute to late John Lewis

Senator Cory Booker , a Democrat from New Jersey, made history on Tuesday night by setting the record for the longest speech in Senate history. His marathon remarks, which began Monday evening, aimed to condemn what he described as the ""grave and urgent"" threat posed by the Trump administration to the country.Booker, who is from New Jersey, surpassed the previous record of 24 hours and 18 minutes, set in 1957 by Senator Strom Thurmond, a Democrat from South Carolina. Booker's speech lasted an astonishing 25 hours and 4 minutes. When he broke the record at 7:19 p.m. ET, he was greeted with raucous applause from his fellow senators.At 7:45 p.m., Booker mentioned that he would ""stop soon,"" and by 8:04 p.m., he concluded his remarks. ""This is a moral moment. It’s not left or right; it’s right or wrong. Let's get in good trouble, my friend. Madam President, I yield the floor,"" Booker said, ending his speech with a standing ovation from his colleagues.His speech quickly gained traction online, going viral across social media platforms. The live feed on his TikTok account had garnered more than 220 million likes by early Tuesday night, even before he surpassed the 24-hour mark. His speech sparked numerous fan edits and widespread attention.At one point, around 7 a.m., Booker continued his remarks, holding up a copy of the Constitution while saying, ""Twelve hours now I’m standing, and I’m still going strong, because this president is wrong, and he’s violating principles that we hold dear and principles in this document that are so clear and plain.""As the hours passed, Booker admitted that he was feeling fatigued. ""I don’t have much gas left in the tank,"" he said around 5 p.m., but he pressed on. ""More Americans need to stand up and say enough is enough,"" Booker urged.Democratic lawmakers have been under increasing pressure from their constituents to respond more forcefully to the Trump administration's sweeping policy changes, including significant cuts to the federal workforce, an increase in deportations, and sweeping tariffs.At noon, Booker received a brief respite when Senate Chaplain Barry Black led a daily prayer. The chaplain mentioned the Capitol staff and police officers who had worked overnight to support the speech.""We are grateful for the efforts of the floor staff, the Capitol Police, the stenographers, the pages, and all those who have worked through the night,"" Chaplain Black said.Booker had begun his speech on Monday evening, declaring his intent to disrupt ""the normal business of the United States Senate for as long as I am physically able."" He described the speech as a warning about the ""grave and urgent"" threats Americans face from the Trump administration, stressing that ""bedrock commitments"" to the country were being broken.A White House spokesperson, responding to Booker's speech, mocked him by referencing his failed 2020 presidential campaign. ""Cory Booker is looking for another ‘I am Spartacus’ moment, but that didn’t work for his failed presidential campaign, and it didn’t work to block President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh. When will he realize he’s not Spartacus — he’s a spoof?"" Harrison Fields, the spokesperson, said in a statement.Booker stood the entire time without leaving the floor for a bathroom break, as doing so would have caused him to lose control of the Senate floor. He was occasionally joined by other Democratic senators, including Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, who spoke admiringly of Booker's endurance during the 23rd hour of the speech.""It's really hard to get your body past hour 22 and 23,"" Murphy said, ""I just don’t think he’s going to stop until he has to stop.""Murphy also mentioned that Booker had been taking small sips from two water glasses placed on his desk, and they had avoided drinking too much water.Booker’s speech, which was his first time leading such a marathon, also included references to the civil rights icon, Representative John Lewis, a Democrat from Georgia, who passed away in 2020. Booker honored Lewis by invoking his words, saying, ""Get in good trouble, necessary trouble, help redeem the soul of America.""Before concluding his speech, Booker reflected on Lewis' legacy, saying, ""Let’s be bolder in America, with a vision that inspires with hope.""NAACP President Derrick Johnson praised Booker’s efforts, calling them an example of courage in dark times. ""The darkest times call on all of us to be courageous, and that is what Cory Booker is doing,"" Johnson told NBC news. He urged Congress to use the tools provided by the Constitution to remove President Trump or at least slow down his agenda.Booker's record-breaking speech brought attention to long speeches that have previously placed senators in the national spotlight. In 2013, Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, spoke for nearly 21 hours and 19 minutes to oppose the Affordable Care Act. In 2010, Senator Bernie Sanders, an Independent from Vermont, delivered an 8½-hour speech that raised his political profile.As Booker surpassed the 22-hour, 26-minute mark set by Senator Wayne Morse, a Democrat from Oregon, in 1953, his speech became the second longest in Senate history. Booker's speech remained uninterrupted until he finally wrapped up, becoming a symbol of defiance against the Trump administration's policies.","Cory Booker, a Democrat from New Jersey, surpassed the previous record of 24 hours and 18 minutes, set in 1957 by Senator Strom Thurmond.

A routine procedural vote in the US House of Representatives turned into an unexpected political showdown as nine Republicans rebelled against their own party, effectively bringing legislative proceedings to a halt for the rest of the week.The move jeopardized two key bills backed by President Donald Trump’s administration that were scheduled for votes on Wednesday and Thursday.House Speaker Mike Johnson , a Republican from Louisiana, expressed frustration over the setback, told Fox News, ""It's a very disappointing result on the floor there, a handful of Republicans joined with all the Democrats to take down a rule. That's rarely done. It's very unfortunate."" He confirmed that the disruption meant no further action could be taken on the House floor for the remainder of the week.The blocked procedural rule would have allowed debate on two bills: one limiting district judges’ power to issue nationwide injunctions and another requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration. The failure of the rule vote marked a significant blow to Republican leadership, which had strongly advocated for the measures.Adding to the tension, the controversy intersected with an ongoing debate over parental leave policies in Congress. Representative Anna Paulina Luna , a Republican from Florida, has been pushing bipartisan legislation to allow new parents in the House to vote remotely for 12 weeks following childbirth.Seeking a way to bring the bill to the floor, Luna filed a "" discharge petition ,"" a rarely used procedural mechanism that can force a House-wide vote if it garners enough support. With backing from Democrats and some Republicans, her effort was on the verge of success.However, House Republican leaders attempted to derail Luna’s bill by inserting language into an unrelated rules package that would have blocked the petition from moving forward. This maneuver sparked backlash from Republicans who either supported Luna’s efforts or opposed the leadership’s last-minute rule changes.Following the rule’s failure, Luna told reporters, ""I think that today is a pretty historical day for the entire conference and showing that, yeah, the body has decided that parents deserve a voice in Washington and also to the importance of female members having a vote in Washington D.C.""Several Republicans on the House Rules Committee were reportedly frustrated over being left out of discussions until the final moments before the vote. Nevertheless, all Republican members of the committee ultimately voted in favor of the rule.Among the Republican lawmakers who voted against the rule were Representatives Tim Burchett of Tennessee, Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, Greg Steube of Florida, Ryan Mackenzie of Pennsylvania, Nick LaLota of New York, Max Miller of Ohio, and Mike Lawler of New York.Miller later explained his decision, stating, ""I could not in good conscience vote for an unprecedented rule that would pull the rug out from under Representative Luna's discharge petition that got the required signatures fair and square."" He added, ""I cannot imagine a mother, who has spent 9 months going through the wringer, being told that you can't be with your infant because you are one of 435 people.""After the legislation failed, Democrats erupted in applause. While House GOP leaders could still reconvene the Rules Committee to revise the language and reschedule a vote, some lawmakers suggested it might be best to pause proceedings.""Lots of torn-up feelings. Might be better to press pause for a couple of days,"" one House Republican remarked, signaling the deep divisions within the party.","Nine Republicans rebelled against their own party, effectively bringing legislative proceedings to a halt for the rest of the week. The move jeopardized two key bills backed by President Donald Trump’s administration that were scheduled for votes on Wednesday and Thursday. House Speaker Mike Johnson expressed frustration over the setback.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119889708,imgsize-173976,width-400,resizemode-4/119889708.jpg"
Marco Rubio: ‘She’s probably spying somewhere’: Marco Rubio’s remark on Tulsi Gabbard at awards event draws laughter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/shes-probably-spying-somewhere-marco-rubios-remark-on-tulsi-gabbard-at-awards-event-draws-laughter/articleshow/119886017.cms,"US Secretary of State Marco Rubio humorously suggested Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard was 'probably spying somewhere' after she missed an event. This comes amid a Senate Intelligence Committee's review of a 'Signalgate' scandal involving Gabbard and discussions about war plans on an encrypted app.

US secretary of state Marco Rubio sparked laughter during Tuesday’s International Women of Courage Award ceremony by joking that director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard was “probably spying somewhere” after she missed the event.As per The Mirror, Rubio’s remark came amid discussions about Gabbard’s recent Senate Intelligence Committee hearing regarding the ""Signalgate"" scandal.Rubio made the comment while acknowledging officials from US President Donald Trump’s cabinet, including attorney general Pam Bondi, secretary of small business Kelly Loeffler, secretary of education Linda McMahon and secretary of labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer.“We’re missing Tulsi Gabbard, because she’s probably spying somewhere right now,” Rubio quipped, drawing chuckles from the audience.Gabbard, the former Democratic congresswoman now serving as the US intelligence chief, recently appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee over allegations that senior Trump officials, including the secretary of defense, discussed war plans over the encrypted messaging app Signal.During a Senate hearing, Senator Mark Warner pressed Gabbard about her possible role in the chat. “Director Gabbard, did you participate in the group chat with the secretary of defense and other Trump senior officials discussing the Yemen war plans?” Warner asked.“Uh, Senator, I don’t want to get into the specific,” Gabbard responded, before Warner interrupted: “You were not ‘TG’ on this group chat?” Gabbard declined to confirm or deny, citing an ongoing National Security Council review.As per The Mirror, CIA director John Ratcliffe later admitted he was part of the Signal chat and defended the practice, stating that using the app was permissible under Biden-era policies as long as key decisions were formally recorded.However, Warner pushed back, demanding that the messages be disclosed. “If there was no classified material, share it with the committee! You can’t have it both ways,” he argued.Rubio, meanwhile, faced separate tensions with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro . After Rubio warned of a “very bad day” for Venezuela due to a security agreement he signed with Guyana, Maduro lashed out, calling Rubio an “imbecile.” “The imbecile Marco Rubio comes out threatening Venezuela from Guyana,” Maduro said at an event, insisting Venezuela could not be intimidated.While the intelligence discussions continued, the International Women of Courage Award ceremony, where Rubio made his remarks, was led by First Lady Melania Trump . As per AP, she praised eight honourees for their bravery, including Israeli lawyer Amit Soussana, who survived 55 days in Hamas captivity. “Every single day that passes is another day of unimaginable suffering,” Soussana said, urging the world to act.Now in its 19th year, the award recognizes women from around the world for exceptional leadership, courage, and advocacy, often at great personal risk. More than 200 women from over 90 countries have been honoured since its inception in 2007.",US Secretary of State Marco Rubio humorously suggested Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard was 'probably spying somewhere' after she missed an event.

Planned Parenthood Funding Freeze: ‘To appease their anti-abortion backers’: US freezes $27.5 million in family planning funds amid compliance review,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/to-appease-their-anti-abortion-backers-us-freezes-27-5-million-in-family-planning-funds-amid-compliance-review/articleshow/119885095.cms,"File photo: US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: PTI)

The US federal government has suspended $27.5 million in family planning grants while investigating whether recipient organizations, including multiple Planned Parenthood affiliates , are complying with legal requirements.The funding freeze affects services such as contraception, cancer screenings and sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing, particularly for low-income communities.As per the news agency Associated Press, 16 organizations were notified of the funding pause on Monday, including all Title X grant recipients in seven states—California, Hawaii, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, and Utah. At least 11 Planned Parenthood regional affiliates are among those impacted.The US department of health and human services (HHS) has not disclosed which laws or executive orders are under scrutiny, though some letters cited civil rights violations.Planned Parenthood, a long-standing target of conservative lawmakers, has strongly criticized the decision. “We know what happens when health care providers cannot use Title X funding,” said Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Action Fund. “People across the country suffer, cancers go undetected, access to birth control is severely reduced, and the nation’s STI crisis worsens”, Johnson added.According to Reuters, HHS said the freeze is part of an evaluation to ensure grant recipients comply with federal law and that taxpayer funds are used responsibly. The department is undergoing extensive layoffs, but officials emphasized that no final decisions have been made regarding spending changes for Planned Parenthood.Mississippi, one of the affected states, has a near-total abortion ban and opponents of the funding freeze argue that the move will further limit access to essential reproductive health care.George Hill, president of Maine Family Planning, said the organization may seek legal action. “The administration’s dangerous decision to withhold Maine Family Planning’s Title X funds jeopardizes access to critical health care services for thousands of Mainers,” Hill said.According to Reuters, Planned Parenthood Great Plains, which serves Missouri, Oklahoma, and Kansas, also denounced the funding halt. “They want to shut down Planned Parenthood health centers to appease their anti-abortion backers, and they’re willing to take away birth control, cancer screenings, and STI testing and treatment to get their way,” said CEO Emily Wales.The Wall Street Journal recently reported that the freeze was implemented under an executive order issued by US President Donald Trump, titled ""Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Open Borders,"" though the specific connection remains unclear.Trump has appointed billionaire Elon Musk to lead the DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) aimed at cutting government spending, a move critics say is fueling aggressive funding reductions.Planned Parenthood notes that more than 300 health centers nationwide operate within the Title X network, with over 1.5 million patient visits recorded in 2023. While federal law prohibits taxpayer money from directly funding most abortions, conservatives have long sought to eliminate Planned Parenthood’s government funding due to its abortion services.","The US federal government has suspended $27.5 million in family planning grants while investigating whether recipient organizations are complying with legal requirements.

Chagos Islands Deal: Trump approves UK-Mauritius deal for Chagos islands,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-approves-uk-mauritius-deal-for-chagos-islands/articleshow/119883762.cms,"Trump approves UK-Mauritius deal for Chagos islands (Picture credit: AP)

US President Donald Trump formally approved the proposed deal between the UK and Mauritius over the future of the Chagos Islands, clearing a major hurdle for the transfer of sovereignty.Downing Street confirmed on Tuesday that the agreement is now in its final stages, with Britain and Mauritius set to negotiate the remaining details before signing a treaty.A spokesperson for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said, “We are now working with the Mauritian government to finalise the deal and sign the treaty,” as quoted by The Independent.The move follows months of discussions with the US, which had an effective veto over the agreement due to the strategic importance of Diego Garcia, the largest atoll in the Indian Ocean archipelago.The agreement will see Britain cede sovereignty over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius while leasing back Diego Garcia for an initial 99-year period, with an option to extend for another 40 years. The base, a key UK-US military asset, has played a vital role in security operations, including counterterrorism missions and regional surveillance.Trump had initially been sceptical of the plan, but when he met Starmer at the White House in February, he signalled his support. “I have a feeling it is going to work out very well,” he said at the time. “I think we will be inclined to go along with your country.”Now, his formal sign-off is expected to give the deal a smoother path to completion.However, the agreement has faced criticism from multiple fronts. Senior Republicans in the US warned that transferring the islands’ sovereignty could strengthen China’s influence in the region. At home, Starmer has come under fire from both the Conservatives, who initially launched the talks in 2022, and Reform UK, who argue that Britain is giving up a strategically vital territory unnecessarily.As per The Independent, critics have also raised concerns about the cost of the deal, which could reach as much as £18 billion. Some question why the UK is paying to lease back an airbase it already controls. Meanwhile, The Financial Times reported that UK officials reassured Washington that the agreement would not come at any expense to US taxpayers.Downing Street has not provided a timeline for the treaty’s finalisation, but sources close to the negotiations believe no further approvals are needed from Washington. The deal stems from an International Court of Justice ruling that Britain should end its sovereignty over the islands.","US President Donald Trump formally approved the proposed deal between the UK and Mauritius over the future of the Chagos Islands.

Mass Layoffs US Health Agencies: ‘This will cost lives’: Mass layoffs reshape US health agencies as thousands receive dismissal notices,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/this-will-cost-lives-mass-layoffs-reshape-us-health-agencies-as-thousands-receive-dismissal-notices/articleshow/119882908.cms,"Hundreds of employees wait in line wrapped around the outside of the Health and Human Services headquarters building (Picture credit: AP)

A sweeping reorganisation of the US department of health and human services (HHS) resulted in thousands of employees receiving dismissal notices on Tuesday.The layoffs, expected to eliminate 10,000 positions, include researchers, scientists, doctors, and senior officials—many of whom have played crucial roles in medical research, drug approvals, and public health monitoring.At the National Institutes of Health (NIH), where Dr Jay Bhattacharya assumed his role as director on the same day, several senior leaders were placed on administrative leave.As per the news agency Associated Press, at least four directors of NIH’s 27 institutes and centers were among those affected, and nearly the entire communications teams were terminated. Some senior employees were reportedly offered transfers to remote locations, such as Alaska, with just 48 hours to respond.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also faced sweeping cuts. As per CNN, entire divisions were eliminated, including the office responsible for drafting new regulations for electronic cigarettes and other tobacco products.Former FDA commissioner Dr Robert Califf lamented the changes and was quoted by CNN saying, “The FDA as we’ve known it is finished, with most of the leaders with institutional knowledge and a deep understanding of product development and safety no longer employed.”Meanwhile, HHS secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr defended the layoffs, saying they would streamline the agency and prioritize fighting chronic disease over what he called “bureaucratic sprawl.” Announcing the changes on social media, he declared, “The revolution begins today!” He also revealed plans to consolidate several agencies under the newly formed Administration for a Healthy America.However, the cuts have drawn criticism from public health experts and lawmakers. Democratic Senator Patty Murray warned that the restructuring could have dire consequences. “They may as well be renaming it the Department of Disease,” she told AP. The CDC, which has lost 2,400 employees, saw deep cuts in divisions working on asthma, reproductive health, air pollution, gun violence and climate change.Beyond federal agencies, state and local health departments are also feeling the impact.HHS recently withdrew over $11 billion in Covid-19-related funding, leading to additional job losses at the state level. Meanwhile, a coalition of state attorneys general has sued the Trump administration, arguing that the cuts are illegal and will exacerbate the opioid crisis and destabilize mental health services.With nearly a quarter of HHS staff eliminated, experts fear that the loss of experienced professionals will leave the country vulnerable to public health threats. “This will cost lives,” warned Dr Tom Frieden , a former CDC director.","HHS secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr defended the layoffs, saying they would streamline the agency and prioritize fighting chronic disease over “bureaucratic sprawl” He also revealed plans to consolidate several agencies under the newly formed Administration for a Healthy America.

JD Vance: 'What happened to accountability?': JD Vance trolled for misleading claims on deportation of Maryland father to El Salvador prison,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-happened-to-accountability-jd-vance-trolled-for-misleading-claims-on-deportation-of-maryland-father-to-el-salvador-prison/articleshow/119879441.cms,"File photo: US Vice President JD Vance (Picture credit: AP)

US Vice President JD Vance has come under fire for falsely claiming that Kilmar Abrego Garcia , a Maryland father deported to El Salvador , was a convicted MS-13 gang member . Online users, including Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal , fact-checked Vance after he cited court documents that reportedly did not support his statement.The controversy erupted when Jon Favreau, a former director of speechwriting for former US President Barack Obama, called out Vance, secretary of state Marco Rubio and Elon Musk over the deportation mistake. “You just admitted to accidentally sending an innocent father from Maryland to a torture dungeon in El Salvador. And you refuse to do anything about it,” he wrote.To which Vance responded and wrote, “My comment is that according to the court document you apparently didn’t read he was a convicted MS-13 gang member with no legal right to be here. My further comment is that it’s gross to get fired up about gang members getting deported while ignoring citizens they victimise.”However, users who examined the court filing found no mention of a conviction.One user countered: “At the urging of JD Vance, I read the relevant court document. It does not say this person was a ‘convicted MS-13 gang member.’ So did Vance not actually read the court document he was hectoring others to read, or is he knowingly making stuff up?”Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal weighed in, writing, “Vice President Vance is lying to your face.”Another user demanded proof, “Can you show us the court document you are referring to and the evidence that led to his ‘conviction’?”Meanwhile, one user expressed outrage at Vance’s response, “So you falsely accused a father of being MS-13, got him deported, and he was tortured—And your response is: ‘oops, not my problem’?”Another wrote, “What happened to accountability? Or is that just for poor people and immigrants?As per CNN, court documents show that Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported despite having protected legal status. The Trump administration admitted in a court filing Monday that “ICE was aware of his protection from removal to El Salvador, but Abrego Garcia was removed to El Salvador because of an administrative error.”However, it argued that US courts lacked jurisdiction to bring him back.According to The Atlantic, Abrego Garcia, who fled gang violence in El Salvador as a teenager, was granted “withholding of removal” status in 2019. This meant he could not be deported due to the high risk of persecution. He had no criminal record in the US and his deportation appears to have resulted from the Trump administration’s attempt to expedite removals.Abrego Garcia’s fate remains uncertain. His wife has not been able to contact him since he was placed in El Salvador’s CECOT prison , a notorious facility known for its harsh conditions. Images released by Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele showed detainees being marched into the facility, and Abrego Garcia’s wife identified him in one of the pictures.Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Abrego Garcia’s attorney, argued in court that the government deported his client “through extrajudicial means because they believed that going through the immigration judge process took too long.”","US Vice President JD Vance has come under fire for falsely claiming that Kilmar Abrego Garcia was a convicted MS-13 gang member.

Pakistan said it killed 10 civilians during an anti-militant operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Saturday.The operation, in Katlang, a remote hilltop area in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, was aimed at militant hideouts and resulted in the deaths of 12 suspected terrorists.

He admitted that unarmed civilians were present at the site.""The safety of civilians is always a top priority during such operations. However, due to complex geography, terrorists using civilian populations as cover, and the urgent nature of the operation, unintended consequences can sometimes occur,"" said Saif, as quoted by the Associated Press.The provincial government has now promised an inquiry into how the operation led to civilian deaths.Local residents reported that the victims were nomads from the Swat region who had been living in the Shamozai mountains with their livestock. Their families protested by placing their bodies on the Swat Highway, demanding justice.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur called the incident “highly condemnable and tragic.” He assured that every effort is made to avoid civilian casualties but acknowledged the challenges of military operations in complex terrains where militants embed themselves among civilians.The government said medical aid is being provided to the injured, and compensation for the victims' families is being arranged. A provincial press note said the operation had ""neutralised several high-value militant targets"" but admitted that the “fog of war” sometimes leads to unintended consequences.","Pakistan said it killed 10 civilians during an anti-militant operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Saturday.

Yet, a glimmer of hope emerged this week for some when Rana Sanaullah, a senior adviser to PM Shehbaz Sharif, suggested that the cutoff might be reconsidered -- a rare hint of flexibility amid unrelenting pressure.The Afghan embassy in Islamabad has slammed Pakistan, accusing it of using arrests and harassment to drive out all Afghans, not just the undocumented.Pakistan’s foreign ministry fired back, insisting its actions target only illegal migrants. The tit-for-tat has fueled a narrative of distrust, with Islamabad blaming Afghan soil for cross-border attacks and Kabul rejecting the claims outright.Pakistani officials link Afghan refugees to rising militancy and crime.

Subsequently, a suicide bombing claimed the lives of at least five paramilitaries.

Pakistani YouTube star Rajab Butt has been charged with blasphemy following the launch of his perfume named ""295"", a reference to Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws.The case was filed after his video promoting the fragrance sparked outrage, particularly from the hardline Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), which places blasphemy at the core of its political agenda.Butt, who boasts millions of followers online, announced the perfume in a now-deleted video, referencing Section 295 of Pakistan’s penal code, which deals with blasphemy. The move triggered widespread condemnation, with TLP leader Haider Ali Shah Gillani filing a formal complaint against him on Monday.""There are numerous sections in the penal code, but why did he choose blasphemy-related sections to name a perfume?"" Gillani was quoted by the news agency AFP, accusing Butt of attempting to ""normalise"" disrespect towards religious laws.According to AFP, the police charge sheet confirms that Butt has been charged under both blasphemy and cybercrime laws. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison.As the controversy increased, Butt released an apology video on Sunday, holding a Quran as he sought forgiveness. ""I apologise for the words I uttered during the launch of the perfume,"" he said. He also announced the immediate discontinuation of the product.The controversy also relates to the late Indian rapper Sidhu Moose Wala ’s song ""295,"" which also referenced blasphemy laws. Butt had previously likened himself to Moose Wala, claiming they both faced persecution under similar legal provisions, according to Daily Pakistan.This is not Butt’s first legal battle. In January, he pleaded guilty to illegally owning a lion cub, which he had received as a wedding gift.A Pakistani court ordered him to create 12 educational videos on animal welfare as part of his punishment. He avoided jail time by pledging to use his platform to raise awareness about responsible treatment of wild animals.Blasphemy remains an extremely sensitive issue in Pakistan, where accusations, often unverified, can lead to mob violence and even killings.The legal provisions under Section 295 have been widely criticised by human rights groups for being used as a tool to target individuals, including religious minorities and public figures.","Pakistani YouTube star Rajab Butt has been charged with blasphemy following the launch of his perfume named ""295,"" a reference to Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws.

QUETTA: The Balochistan government , under the leadership of chief minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti , has decided to take stringent measures against government employees involved in anti-state activities , as reported by ARY News.In a high-level meeting chaired by CM Bugti, which was attended by the IG Balochistan and the chief secretary, the government announced that it would target individuals involved in anti-state propaganda and activism.According to ARY News, CM Bugti instructed all commissioners and district officers to act swiftly against any government employees suspected of promoting anti-state narratives or participating in activities that challenge the state's authority. The government's move appears to be a direct attempt to suppress activism and dissent within the province, especially among those critical of the state's policies. Bugti also confirmed that individuals involved in such actions would be placed under strict surveillance by being added to the Fourth Schedule for closer monitoring.ARY News also reported that CM Bugti directed all heads of educational institutions in the province to ensure the national flag is hoisted and the national anthem is recited regularly. Educational leaders who fail to enforce these directives are being told to resign, which signals a heightened crackdown on any form of resistance within these spaces.This renewed focus on stifling activism in Balochistan reflects the government's broader strategy to assert control over the region, including monitoring and potentially silencing any opposition to its policies.This comes amidst the detention of Baloch leaders and activists. Activists in the Balochistan region have frequently organised protests and campaigns, calling attention to the region's marginalisation.In response, governments have implemented harsh crackdowns, often leading to the detention of Baloch leaders and activists. These actions have sparked widespread criticism from international human rights organisations, highlighting concerns over the suppression of political expression and the stifling of peaceful advocacy for regional rights.","The Balochistan government has decided to take stringent measures against government employees involved in anti-state activities.

Shivangini Rana

KATHMANDU: Rumours swirled in Kathmandu on Monday that two senior Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) leaders could face treason charges — a crime punishable by life imprisonment in Nepal — after police produced them in court for involvement in the March 28 pro-monarchy violence in which two persons, including a journalist, were killed. The passports of current MP Dhawal Shumsher Rana and Rabindra Mishra have been revoked, and demands to impound former king Gyanendra Shah ’s passport were raised in parliament, Rana’s family members told TOI on Monday evening.RPP senior vice-president Mishra and general secretary Rana, a member of the lower house, were remanded in custody for five days by Kathmandu district court judge Taradevi Maharjan. The court permitted further investigation under charges related to crimes against the state. The duo were among 11 people presented in court on Monday, said court information officer Deepak Kumar Shrestha. Mishra was handcuffed; Rana was not.Rana’s daughter Shivangini told TOI that her father had been diagnosed with cancer in Nepal and treated at the Head and Neck Cancer Institute of India in Mumbai in September. He had just completed a round of radiation therapy and was due to return to India for follow-up treatment, but was not allowed to leave. “I won’t be surprised if they (govt) slap ridiculous charges against him,” she said. “Their passports have also been impounded. Neither he nor Mishra can leave the country now. He was due for treatment in India, but it is now clear that he cannot leave Nepal anytime soon.”Shivangini added that the family had been informed verbally by officials that the passports of both leaders were being held “until further notice”, but no formal communication had been received.Meanwhile, during a session of the federal parliament on Monday, lawmakers from the ruling coalition demanded that former king Gyanendra Shah’s passport also be impounded in connection with the violent demonstrations. Rastriya Janamorcha MP Chitra Bahadur KC said that a thorough investigation into the former king’s role was “essential to protect the republic”.Ramhari Sharma Kafle, chief of the Kathmandu district public prosecutor ’s office, said Mishra, Rana and others may be charged with crimes against the state after preliminary investigation. Of the nearly 200 persons – locals, members of various political parties – arrested and detained so far, police have produced 42 people in court, including those held under charges of criminal mischief and organised crime. The rest are under further investigation, police said.According to officials, the March 28 ‘ Janadolan ’ — led by Durga Prasai’s Nepal Royalist Movement — turned violent and led to widespread vandalism in Kathmandu. Protesters allegedly damaged homes, a hospital, vehicles, and a political party office, and looted a shopping mall. They also reportedly seized a weapon from the armed police. The aam sabha was led by Prasai. Rana was called in as a moral supporter and guest. Businessman-activist Prasai was appointed its ""people’s commander"".Police said Prasai has been on the run since Friday’s protest. On Sunday, he released a video on Facebook saying he was staying in a temple in the capital. Meanwhile, police arrested Gopal Malla, 38, from Bhimsen Gola for allegedly stealing a gas gun from an armed police officer during the violence. The gun has not yet been recovered. Malla, originally from Sainamaina municipality in Rupandehi, now resides in Tarakeshwar-10, Kathmandu.In another development, Kathmandu Metropolitan City has fined Gyanendra Shah Nepalese Rs 793,000 (INR 4 lakh) for protest-related damage. Officials issued the fine over multiple infractions, including littering streets, breaking public railings and damaging fire engines used during the protest. The city police attempted to deliver the letter at Gyanendra’s estate Nirmal Niwas but were turned away by his staff. The notice was subsequently sent by post.Shivangini added that Rana was among the few MPs to oppose foreign influence in Nepal’s political affairs. “In Parliament, he was the only MP who spoke against over 100 million dollars that came into Nepal to promote secularism and conversion,” she said, referencing remarks made by former US president Donald Trump.According to Shivangini, her father supports restoring Nepal as a Hindu kingdom. “He believes bringing back the monarchy and Hindu Rashtra can restore dignity and unite the people. The current democratic system and elected parties have failed the country. He always says, ‘To change the situation, we must change the system.’”On the day of the protest, she said Rana was not the organiser but attended as coordinator of the Janandolan committee. “It was organised by Durga Prasai. My father was present to speak, but before he could, tear gas shells landed on the stage. Everyone ran,” she said. “There were others who provoked the crowd. My father wasn’t one of them. He was unarmed, standing in the middle of the road.”Shivangini showed TOI the video footage that she said showed Rana urging protestors not to resort to violence. “Even after police began firing tear gas, he was asking people not to throw stones and trying to manage the crowd,” she said. “Yet they are talking about charging him with treason.” She said Rana’s driver was shot twice during the protest. “He was just standing next to my father. That bullet could have hit him.”She also alleged the police action was premeditated. “Officers were stationed on rooftops. As soon as we started the national anthem, tear gas rained down. The crowd hadn’t even fully gathered yet. It was all staged,” she said. “We’ve always said our protest will be peaceful, like Mahatma Gandhi’s. We don’t believe in violence.”Shivangini said the govt is deliberately building a case against her father. “There’s fear in the govt. This movement has shaken the country. People are fed up with corruption and political failure. That’s why they want to silence voices like his.”",Two senior Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) leaders could face treason charges.

"We want our guardian back, says RPP, calls for Hindu Rashtra",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/we-want-our-guardian-back-says-rpp-calls-for-hindu-rashtra/articleshow/119834327.cms,"KATHMANDU: Swati Thapa , central committee member of Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP), weighs her words carefully. “The people want the king back,” she says. “Not as a ruler. As a guardian. A stabilising force. And they want Nepal restored as a Hindu rashtra . These are not political slogans anymore — they’re the people’s survival instincts.”RPP was formed in 1990 following the restoration of multi-party democracy. It began with four seats in the 1991 parliamentary elections and has remained a fluctuating but persistent presence in Nepali politics, often playing the role of kingmaker. In 2022, RPP secured 14 of 275 seats in the federal parliament, marking a modest resurgence. The party was part of the current coalition government until Feb 2023, when it withdrew support.Her party – from which several senior leaders have been arrested or detained – has long championed these demands: the return of a constitutional monarchy, the removal of the country’s “expensive” federal structure, and reinstatement of Nepal as a Hindu state. The return of Nepal as a Hindu rashtra is central to RPP’s vision. “This country became secular without asking its people. That’s the truth,” she said. “We believe more than 80% of Nepalis still want a Hindu state.”Thapa brushes off the concern that RPP’s agenda might alienate moderates or minorities. “This doesn’t mean discrimination (against other communities). It means protection of what’s ours. We respect every religion. But we will not lose ourselves in the process. Why must we keep apologising for our roots?” she said.She alleges that “coerced” conversions — particularly in remote and poor areas — are altering the cultural fabric of the country. “Foreign aid is being used to change who we are,” she said, naming Western agencies as enablers. “We respect all faiths. But this cannot come at the cost of Nepal’s soul.”.Former king Gyanendra Shah’s re-emergence has been a flashpoint in the country. His recent ""return"" to Kathmandu saw enormous crowds — but he remains silent. Is that silence a strategy or a missed moment? “He is not responsible for this movement. He is above all that is happening,” Thapa insisted. “And we don’t want to drag him into daily politics. But the people still revere him. They see him as someone who didn’t steal from them. Someone they can trust. So even his silence has weight.”She confirmed that RPP maintains contact with the royal family and said ""monarchy must remain above political manoeuvring"". On the tricky subject of succession — especially given public unease with Gyanendra’s son, Paras — Thapa is straightforward. “We’ve said clearly: succession should not be automatic.Thapa said, “We've been saying clearly: succession will be from the king's linage. Gyanendra might skip a generation as his has publicly said that he has no interest to rule the country. But it could be his son, grandson or someone from their family. Whatever decision will be taken that will be later after restoration of the monarchy.’When prodded that it's not really how monarchies work, she said that a member of the royal family would always wear the crown, but it would not necessarily be the eldest son. “The bloodline would be at the bottom of our list of what makes our king,” she said. “We’re not talking about bringing back direct rule. The king would be symbolic. The executive power would rest with a directly elected prime minister. But we need a figure above the fray. Someone the country can rally around.”Even if RPP succeeds, the road to restoring a monarchy, even a constitutional one, would take some time. And if not the king, then who? “There is no Plan B,” she said. “That is our honest answer. We see no other figure who can command the trust of the people. That’s why we want the monarchy — not for nostalgia, but because the republic has failed to offer us a credible alternative.”That sentiment has long existed within the party. But in recent weeks, it has found unexpected traction beyond it.What was once a political platform has spilled onto the streets. The slogans once confined to RPP rallies are now the chants of thousands. On March 28, these protests turned violent. Two people, including a journalist, died. Over a hundred were injured. More than 50 — including RPP veterans Rabindra Mishra and MP Dhawal Shumsher Rana — were arrested.“We are not leading all these protests,” Thapa clarified. “But we have given moral support to those that share our goals. This is a joint effort, driven by the public. We are not claiming ownership, and we don’t want to. That would be missing the point.”She said RPP’s movement has been non-violent, with a set calendar of demonstrations. “Our programme has always been peaceful. What happened on March 28 wasn’t who we are.” Thapa blamed state provocation. “We have footage of tear gas fired from rooftops by police in civilian clothes. The crowd was unarmed.” The party has called for a thorough investigation and continues to protest in all 77 districts.Thapa described the surge in support as driven by a profound loss of direction. “People aren’t just angry. They’re exhausted. Corruption, inflation, political instability...”When asked about the absence of political flags at rallies, she said she views it as an affirmation rather than a threat. “We’re proud to see the national flag. Even in our own programmes, we use it. It’s not about RPP. It’s about Nepal.”One of the more visible faces during the recent mobilisation has been controversial figure and former Maoist Durga Prasai, whom some have criticised for inflammatory rhetoric. “We supported the agenda he stood for,” Thapa said. “That doesn’t mean we support everything about his style. Our commitment is to peaceful protest. Anyone who wants the same future for Nepal is welcome — but not at the cost of our principles.”As the protests evolve and the govt continues its crackdown, Thapa said she and her party remain firm. “This is not a passing storm. It’s a reckoning. And it’s just beginning.”","Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) was formed in 1990 following the restoration of multi-party democracy.
