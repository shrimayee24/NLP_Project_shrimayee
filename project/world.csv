'Sin': BJP accuses Nehru of dropping Maa Durga stanzas from Vande Mataram in 1937; takes 'pungent echo' dig at Rahul,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sin-bjp-accuses-nehru-of-dropping-maa-durga-stanzas-from-vande-mataram-in-1937-takes-pungent-echo-dig-at-rahul/articleshow/125148651.cms,"'RJD Put Katta To Congress' Head': PM Modi Slams Mahagathbandhan In Bihar Rally

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party on Friday accused India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of committing a ""historic sin"" by truncating certain parts of Vande Matram which hailed Goddess Durga.In a social media post on X, BJP spokesperson CR Kesavan said that Congress, under Nehru's presidentship, adopted only a truncated Vande Mataram as the party’s national song in its 1937 Faizpur session. He also cited Nehru's letter to Subhash Chandra Bose where Nehru said that Vande Matram has nothing to do with Goddess Durga and opines that Vande Mataram is not suitable as a national song.""It is imperative for our younger generation to know how the Congress party brazenly pandering to its communal agenda under the Presidentship of Nehru, adopted only a truncated Vande Mataram as the party’s national song in its 1937 Faizpur Session, while PM Narendra Modi today will inaugurate the 150th year commemoration & participate in the mass recital of the full version of our glorious Vande Mataram across the nation,"" Kesavan said.""The glorious Vande Mataram became the voice of our nation’s unity and solidarity, celebrating our motherland, instilling nationalistic spirit and fostering patriotism. Chanting it was made a criminal offense by the British. It did not belong to any particular religion or language. But the Congress committed the historic sin and blunder of linking the song with religion. Congress under Nehru citing religious grounds deliberately removed stanzas of Vande Mataram which hailed Goddess Ma Durga,"" he added.The BJP leader also attacked leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi, claiming that ""Hindu Virodhi mentality"" of Nehru finds a pungent echo in Congress leader's recent remarks on Chatth Puja.""In a letter dated Sep 1, 1937, Nehru spitefully writes that anybody considering the words in Vande Mataram as anything to do with a Goddess was absurd. He also derisively opines that Vande Mataram is not suitable as a national song. Netaji Subash Bose had strongly advocated for the full original version of Vande Mataram. On Oct 20, 1937 Nehru wrote to Netaji Bose claiming that the background of Vande Mataram was likely to irritate Muslims. He went on to say that there does seem to be substance regarding outcry against Vande Mataram and people who are communalistically inclined have been affected by it,"" he said.""In 1937 if Nehru as Congress president blanked out the mention of Goddess Ma Durga by truncating Vande Mataram, Rahul Gandhi in March 2024 maliciously remarked ‘ There is a word called Shakti in Hindu Dharma and we are fighting against Shakti’. The Hindu Virodhi mentality of Nehru finds a pungent echo in Rahul Gandhi who recently demeaned and maligned the sacred Chatth Puja as a drama, hurting the sentiments of crores of devotees,"" he added.This comes as Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to launch year long celebrations to commemorate 150 years of national song at Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium on Friday. He will also release a commemorative stamp and coin during the event.The programme will mark the formal launch of the year-long nationwide commemoration of the composition that inspired India's freedom movement and continues to evoke national pride and unity.Composed by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, 'Vande Mataram' was first published in the literary journal 'Bangadarshan' on November 7, 1875.""Later, Bankim Chandra Chatterjee incorporated the hymn in his immortal novel 'Anandamath' which was published in 1882. It was set to music by Rabindranath Tagore. It has become an integral part of the nation's civilisational, political and cultural consciousness,"" a government statement said.","Bharatiya Janata Party accuses India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of committing a ""historic sin"" by truncating certain parts of Vande Matram which hailed Goddess Durga.

KRISHNAGIRI: A woman and her boyfriend were arrested on Wednesday on charges of installing a hidden camera in a bathroom at a hostel for Tata Electronics Private Limited women employees in Krishnagiri district of Tamil Nadu, superintendent of police P Thangadurai said in a statement.The arrested have been identified as Neelukumari Gupta, 22, from Odisha, who is an employee of Tata Electronics Private Limited facility at Nagamangalam in the district and who stayed at the women’s hostel named Vidiyal Residency in Lalikkal area, and her boyfriend Santhosh, 25. The Udanapalli police arrested Santhosh from Bengaluru. The police said Neelukumari had installed the camera in the bathroom as instructed by Santhosh.Vidiyal Residency has 11 floors and eight blocks, providing accommodation for more than 6,000 women. Four women were staying in each room. The camera was installed on Sunday (Nov 2) in the bathroom of a room occupied by women from northern states, said additional superintendent of police Shankar.

'No Remorse, God Provoked Me': Lawyer Rakesh Kishore Defends His Shoe Attack On CJI BR Gavai

Accommodated request twice, AG not being fair to court: CJI





NEW DELHI: Unaffected by the rebuke from Supreme Court for seeking reference of petitions challenging the validity of the Tribunal Reforms Act to a five-judge bench half-way through the final hearing in the matter, attorney general R Venkataramani made a fresh request for adjournment on Thursday, upsetting CJI B R Gavai, who wondered why the top law officer wasn't being direct enough to seek adjournment of the hearing beyond Nov 24, when a new CJI assumes office.Venkataramani, who had already been granted two adjournments to enable him to participate in an international arbitration proceeding, through ASG Aishwarya Bhati, requested the bench to adjourn the hearing scheduled for Friday to Monday.The CJI, who on Nov 3 had refused to accept the Centre’s application seeking reference of the case to a five-judge bench and termed it as an attempt to drag the matter beyond his retirement date of Nov 23, told Bhati that the AG is “not being fair to the court” despite the bench, also including Justices K Vinod Chandran and Vipul Pancholi, accommodating his request for adjournment twice in the past.“If you want to have the hearing after Nov 24 (when Justice Surya Kant takes over as CJI), you should frankly say that,” the CJI said, adding that “every now and then it is told to us that the AG is busy with international arbitration and yet the Centre comes out with a midnight application seeking reference of the case midway through the final hearing to a five-judge bench.”“We have highest regard for the office of the highest law officer.But when we were practising in HCs, we used to give up cases if we were engaged in a part-heard matter before any bench to enable the HC to complete the hearing as scheduled,” CJI remarked. Though the CJI reluctantly agreed to adjourn the case to Monday, he pointed out that the bench needed enough time to write the judgment. The petitions before SC challenged the provisions of the Tribunal Reforms Act which put in place a uniform tenure of four years for the chairperson and members of different tribunals, even though SC had ruled that the tenure should be of five years.On Nov 3, the bench had said, “We did not expect the Union govt to indulge in such tactics. After we have heard the petitioners fully, the Union govt cannot be permitted to take the plea for reference to a larger bench.” However, it clarified that “if on consideration of the arguments, we arrive at a conclusion that the matter involves substantial questions of law requiring reference to a 5-J bench, we will do so”.",Attorney general R Venkataramani made a fresh request for adjournment on Thursday.

Ladakh Statehood Violence: BJP Blames Congress While Sonam Wangchuk Says Gen-Z Led The Protests

SRINAGAR: A judicial commission set up by Union home ministry to probe the September 24 violence in Leh Thursday said it was not getting a “good response” from the public, and appealed to the people to come forward and depose before it.Addressing a press conference in Leh, IAS officer Tushar Anand, administrative secretary of the inquiry commission, said, “The greater the number of people submitting evidence, the more impartial the investigation will be and that will help ensure justice.”Ananad, who was accompanied by Rigzin Spalgon, joint secretary for the panel, said it would not be possible to conduct a fair inquiry if people did not come forward. “We won’t get information on our own. People must step up and share whatever they know so that we can examine the evidence and make a proper decision,” he said.He said officials and ground-level staff posted at the site during the incident were being identified and once their list was prepared, they would have to depose before the commission. “But, many people may have seen what happened. If they come forward, it will help the inquiry,” he added.The ministry of home affairs announced the commission on Oct 17 after Leh Apex Body (LAB) and Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA), the two major political organisations in the Union Territory of Ladakh, demanded a judicial probe headed by a retired Supreme Court judge as a precondition for resuming dialogue with the Centre.The inquiry commission, chaired by retired SC judge Justice B S Chauhan, began its work on Oct 27 and a day later, issued a public notice inviting people to share information related to the Sept 24 incident. The evidence can be submitted till Nov 28, after which the commission will start its hearing.When asked about reports that some people were allegedly forced by security forces to delete their videos and were now afraid to share evidence, the official said: “Even if the videos have been deleted, people can still submit written statements explaining that they were forced to delete them.” “Anyone having information, whether in video, written, or oral form, can submit it through an affidavit,” he added.On Sept 24, police and paramilitary forces allegedly opened fire on protesters demanding statehood and Sixth Schedule status for Ladakh, after demonstrations turned violent, killing four people and injuring more than 90. Subsequently, more than 70 people, including climate activist Sonam Wangchuk, were arrested.After the announcement of the judicial probe, the Centre held talks with representatives of LAB and KDA on Oct 22 in New Delhi.

Lalu Yadav, Family Cast Votes as First Phase of Bihar Polling Gets Underway

PATNA: Voting in the first phase of the Bihar assembly elections concluded with a 57.9% turnout in Patna district that was driven by enthusiastic participation from both young voters and senior citizens across the urban constituencies. The district average of 57.93% is a clear rise from 51.12% in 2020 as polling stations in Bankipur, Digha, Kumhrar and Patna Sahib hummed with energy through the day.In Digha, the polling percentage reached 41.4%, up from 36.86% in 2020. Bankipur recorded 40.97% compared to 35.85% five years ago. Kumhrar saw a 39.57% voter turnout, an increase from 35.22% in 2020, while the highest jump was in Patna Sahib, where 59.93% of voters cast their ballots, up from 52.22% in the last election. Despite the usual logistical hiccups, the mood reflected a shared desire for jobs, development and accountability.Sarita Kumari (20), a first-time voter, flaunted her inked finger at a polling booth in Shastri Nagar and took selfies with her friend. Better education, a better system and employment opportunities, she said, were the issues she kept in mind while voting.A resident of Ashiana, college student K P Mishra (19) said he was thrilled.""Bihar has transformed significantly from the past. I remember the situation when I was in school. And now I am doing graduation and truly enjoy living here,"" he said.""We have waited too long for real change - jobs for youth, better roads and reliable power. The one job per family promise is luring. We want a better future for our kids,"" 55-year-old Sharad Kumar said at a polling station in Gulzarbagh.

'BIG ZERO': PM Modi Takes Massive Dig At RJD, Cong's 'Jungle Raj' Report Card for Bihar in Araria

Violence, accusations and counter-claims

The firsts of Bihar elections

Record turnouts

Campaigns pick up more heat



NEW DELHI: The first phase of the Bihar assembly elections on Thursday recorded the state’s highest-ever voter turnout, with 64.66 per cent of 3.75 crore electors exercising their franchise across 121 constituencies.The Election Commission said polling concluded peacefully “in a festive mood with the highest-ever voter turnout of 64.66 per cent in the history of Bihar”. Bihar's chief electoral officer Vinod Singh Gunjiyal said women voters participated in large numbers with “a lot of enthusiasm”.Several prominent leaders, including Yadav, deputy chief ministers Samrat Choudhary and Vijay Kumar Sinha, and a number of ministers, were among the 1,314 candidates contesting in this phase.Stray incidents were reported during polling, including an alleged attack on a vehicle in deputy Vijay Kumar Sinha’s convoy. Sinha, seeking a fourth consecutive term from Lakhisarai, alleged that RJD supporters tried to “intimidate” extremely backward class voters.Sinha lashed out at the Lakhisarai Superintendent of Police (SP) and demanded the deployment of a ""special force"" after his convoy was attacked by people he claimed were supporters of the opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD).He also had a heated verbal spat with RJD MLC Ajay Kumar. The two leaders were seen hurling abuses at each other as their convoys came face-to-face. As the RJD MLC accused Sinha of being a ""criminal"", alleging that he was trying to intimidate voters, Sinha hit back, calling Kumar a ""failed leader"" and ""drunk."" The latter dismissed the ""drunk"" charge, saying that it was ""Mahua"" (local liquor).On the other hand, the RJD alleged on X that voting had been “deliberately slowed down” in areas where the INDIA bloc is believed to have strong support. The Election Commission rejected the accusation.At the Manjhi assembly constituency in the Saran district, a vehicle of CPM candidate Dr Satyendra Yadav, representing the Grand Alliance, was attacked by miscreants during the first phase of polling. The attack resulted in the shattering of his SUV's windows, creating a chaotic atmosphere in the area. The incident occurred in Jaitpur village under Daudpur police station area, while Yadav was on a tour of his constituency.A notable feature of this election was the presence of Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj Party. Kishor has promised to make Bihar “among the top-ranking ones in the country” and has said he intends to scrap the prohibition law, arguing that it has weakened the state’s resources.For the first time, there was live webcasting of polling in 100% of the polling stations, with chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar and election commissioners S S Sandhu and Vivek Joshi monitoring the feed from the EC control room here. The CEC engaged with the presiding officers and district election officers from the control room to ensure the smooth progress of polling.Another first in this election was the visit of 16 foreign delegates from six countries to Bihar as part of the international election visitors' programme (IEVP), to witness the poll proceedings . The delegates, EC said, hailed the Bihar elections for being one of the most well-organised, transparent, efficient and participative elections, internationally. Over 90,000 'jeevika didis' or female volunteers were deployed to assist the polling personnel in identifying the 'purdahnasheen' (veiled) women electors.The presiding officers updated the voter turnout figures at the close of poll before leaving the polling station, cutting the delay in updation of approximate voter turnout trends. Earlier these figures would land till as late as 11.30 pm on polling day.The Bihar polls witnessed use of colour photos of candidates on EVM ballot papers.In another first, electors could deposit their mobiles at the polling stations. Modified voter information slips ensured easy readability. Given that the voters per polling station was capped at 1200, voting could proceed without any long queues and extra waiting times.Polling took place across 18 districts. Muzaffarpur recorded the highest turnout at 70.96 per cent, followed by Samastipur at 70.63 per cent.Madhepura recorded 67.21 per cent, Vaishali 67.37 per cent, Saharsa 66.84 per cent, Khagaria 66.36 per cent, Lakhisarai 65.05 per cent, Munger 60.40 per cent, Siwan 60.31 per cent, Nalanda 58.91 per cent, and Patna 57.93 per cent. Lower turnout in urban Patna was attributed to areas such as Bankipur, Digha, and Kumhrar.According to the Election Commission, the state’s lowest turnout was 42.6 per cent in the 1951-52 assembly polls, while the previous highest was 62.57 per cent in 2000. The turnout stood at 57.29 per cent in 2020, 56.91 per cent in 2015, and 52.73 per cent in 2010.As the campaign moves into its final phase, caste and community loyalties continue to play a decisive role, with Yadavs, Kushwahas, Kurmis, Brahmins, and Dalits shaping outcomes in several constituencies.The NDA is banking on chief minister Nitish Kumar’s governance record and recent welfare measures such as 125 units of free electricity, Rs 10,000 cash transfers to more than one crore women, and an increase in social security pensions.The opposition countered that voters were ready for change. RJD president Lalu Prasad posted on X, “If a roti is not flipped on a tawa (pan), it gets burnt. Twenty years is a long time. A Tejashwi government is essential to build a new Bihar.”During campaign events for the second phase, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the high female turnout signalled support for the ruling alliance.“Mothers, daughters, and sisters have been the worst sufferers of 'jungle raj'. Today, they seem to have put up a fortress around polling booths to prevent the return of 'jungle raj',” PM Modi said.The polls, conducted after the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls that opposition parties criticised for alleged “rigging” and “manipulation”, are being viewed as an early indicator of political sentiment ahead of 2029.The NDA, which has held power in the state for two decades except for brief intervals, is highlighting its record of “sushasan” (good governance). The opposition INDIA bloc is relying on anti-incumbency and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav’s “jobs-for-every-home” promise to mount its challenge.The second and final phase will take place on November 11, and the counting will be held on November 14.","First phase of Bihar assembly elections recorded the state’s highest-ever voter turnout, with 64.66 per cent of 3.75 crore electors exercising their franchise across 121 constituencies.

DEHRADUN/UTTARKASHI: Villages in Uttarakhand's Garhwal region have begun enforcing new wedding norms - limiting women to wearing only three gold ornaments and banning alcohol - as part of a community-led effort ""to bring simplicity and equality back into marriage rituals"". The rules, passed recently by village panchayats in Chakrata's tribal belt and in Uttarkashi's Dunda block, aim to reduce wedding expenses, end displays of wealth and protect families from the rising costs of social expectation.In Chakrata's Kandhad and Indroli villages, the panchayat ruled that women would be permitted to wear only a nose pin, mangalsutra and earrings at weddings. Families that violate the restriction will be fined Rs 50,000, residents said. The resolution, which was passed unanimously, followed informal discussions among women who said the rising cost of gold and social expectations around ornaments were placing a disproportionate burden on poorer households.""For weddings, women are invited for a community meal - it's part of our tradition before the marriage of the elder son,"" said Leeko Devi, 45, from Kandhad. ""But gold had turned that into a burden.Every year, the pressure grew - more ornaments, more judgment. Now, we've decided we'll all wear the same three pieces, and that's enough.""After the ornament rule was adopted, attention turned to liquor. ""We've started talking about banning liquor too,"" Devi said. ""It doesn't add anything meaningful to our ceremonies. It just turns weddings into shows of wealth.""That conversation turned into a decision in Lodara village of Uttarkashi's Dunda block, where the gram sabha passed a resolution earlier this week to ban alcohol at weddings and 'mundan' ceremonies. A fine of Rs 51,000 was approved for violations, and families that serve alcohol will face social boycott.""No one from our village will attend a wedding where liquor is served,"" said Kavita Butola, Lodara's village head. ""The decision came after meetings involving the Mahila Mangal Dal and Yuvak Mangal Dal. People are tired of weddings becoming more about spending than the rituals themselves.""Residents said these steps were necessary to address growing social pressure on families to organise weddings that display wealth, whether through jewellery, catering or alcohol. ""Ornaments used to symbolise happiness,"" said Arjun Singh, a village elder in Kandhad. ""Now they symbolise anxiety. People don't sleep at night before their daughter's wedding, wondering how they'll afford the jewellery and gifts. ""Tikam Singh, 56, who supported both resolutions, said the changes were long overdue. ""There was music, some food, and the rituals. Now it's DJs, imported liquor, staged photos. This isn't us. These rules bring the ceremony back to its centre.""","Villages in Uttarakhand's Garhwal region have begun enforcing new wedding norms.

Aam Aadmi Party national convener Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday campaigned in favour of party candidate Harmeet Singh Sandhu for the November 11 bypoll for the Tarn Taran assembly seat in Punjab.Addressing a gathering, Kejriwal said Sandhu's victory will give a boost to development in the border region and strengthen the hands of the Bhagwant Mann government.Punjab government is making exemplary efforts to ensure welfare of every section of the society, and a victory from the Tarn Taran seat is important for continuation of the ongoing pace of development in the state, the AAP leader said.Pointing out that no chief minister had visited the border town earlier, due to which it lagged behind in development, Kejriwal said that it was Mann, after assuming office in March 2022, who gave an impetus for the region's progress.Kejriwal lauded the Mann government for transforming some of the government schools into ""Schools of Eminence"".No private school is a match to these government schools, he said, adding that the rest of the government schools will also be renovated in the same manner.The Mann government has brought a major revolution in all the sectors in the last three years, said Kejriwal, urging people to give a mandate in favour of his ""pro-people"" policies by electing AAP candidate Sandhu.In his address, Chief Minister Mann said the state government has taken several ""historic"" initiatives, and expressed confidence that people will vote for AAP in the upcoming bypoll.Coming down heavily on opposition leaders, Mann said they had ""plundered"" the state's resources for their vested political interests.These leaders had ""built their own palaces and business empires at the cost of the people and the state,"" said Mann, adding that any person who looted even a single penny of public money will be made accountable.The chief minister reiterated his government's commitment to bring to book corrupt leaders and officers, however affluent they may be.He also slammed the Congress and the Akalis, accusing them of patronising gangsters.Polling for the Tarn Taran seat will be held on November 11, and the counting of votes will take place on November 14.The seat fell vacant after the death of AAP MLA Kashmir Singh Sohal in June.

NEW DELHI: Two people were killed and three others seriously injured after being hit by a suburban train near Sandhurst Road railway station in south Mumbai on Thursday evening, police said.""Two persons were brought dead to the hospital, while three were injured. Of these, two took discharge against medical advice (DAMA), while one is being treated,"" an official said.The incident occurred around 7 pm, shortly after suburban train services on Central Railway were disrupted due to a flash strike by employees’ unions protesting an FIR against two engineers in connection with the June 9 Mumbra accident that killed four people.According to a railway official, four people, three women and a man had alighted from the wrong side and were walking on the tracks when a down fast local train hit them. The GRP confirmed they had stepped off an up slow local at Sandhurst Road after services were halted by the protest.The June 9 Mumbra crash occurred when two trains passed each other on a sharp curve, causing commuters on the footboards to fall after their backpacks brushed against each other.Following the probe, two Central Railway engineers were booked under Section 125(a)(b) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita for endangering life or personal safety.Later, the railway unions staged a sudden protest at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT), halting suburban operations between 5.50 pm and 6.45 pm.Services resumed only after senior officials assured protesters that the issue would be taken up with the state authorities, PTI reported.The disruption led to massive overcrowding during rush hour. Many outstation passengers at Thane were stranded as locals heading to Kalyan and beyond boarded long-distance trains, forcing railway officials to allow alternate travel arrangements.","Four people, three women and a man had alighted from the wrong side and were walking on the tracks when a down fast local train hit them.

JD Vance's Hindu Wife Usha To Convert After Vice President's Pitch? US Expert’s Big Reveal

From victim to villian









FBI director Kash Patel 's girlfriend Alexis Wilkins raised her voice in support of Second Lady Usha Vance amid a heightened scrutiny on Usha's religion, her relationship with the Vice President etc. The row started with JD Vance asserting that he hopes his wife converts to Christianity, but did not end with JD clarifying that he is well aware that Usha is not inclined to leave her Hindu faith and embrace Christianity. Usha Vance was slammed for not issuing any statement amid the row and instead appearing in public on the occasion of Halloween with her family.Democratic commentator Kaivan Shroff, in a blog, opined that while Usha Vance is being considered as a victim, in reality, she is not. Calling Vance the villain, Shroff wrote: ""The second lady deserves to be held accountable for what she’s chosen to represent and the role she has willingly played in an admin whose values run counter to her very existence.""Country music singer and political commentator Alexis Wilkin, who is also Kash Patel's girlfriend, reacted to the vilification of Usha Vance and condemned it, calling it 'insane and dangerous'.Wilkins also supported Democratic politician Ro Khanna who said that while JD Vance should be criticized for his policies, his family and children should not bear the brunt.Alexis herself faces a lot of trolling because of her relationship with FBI director Kash Patel as MAGA commentators call Alexis an Israeli spy who 'honeytrapped' Patel. Patel was at the center of a major row after former FBI agent Kyle Seraphin pointed out that Patel attended an event where Alexis performed on his government plane. Seraphin also claimed that Patel fired a senior FBI staff member who was in charge of aviation records after it got leaked, and also blocked public viewing of his flight data.Usha Vance was initially portrayed as a victim of MAGA politics as MAGA won't accept a non-Christian first lady. In his ambition to run for the presidency in 2028, JD Vance was distancing from his wife's Hindu religion -- this was the narrative, But within a few days, the narrative changed making Usha Vance the villain. Donald Trump's biographer Michael Wolff commented that JD Vance and Usha Vance are in it together and they are plotting every day to achieve the presidency.","Kash Patel's girlfriend condemned the vilification of Usha Vance amid the Hindu- Christian row.

Former NFL superstar Antonio Brown has once again found himself in the center of a serious legal storm. The 37-year-old ex-wide receiver has been extradited from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, back to the United States to face an attempted murder charge in connection with a shooting that occurred outside a boxing event in South Florida earlier this year. According to the Miami Herald, Brown is expected to stand trial after a warrant was issued for his arrest in June.“Brown’s Instagram posts show he has been in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, for the last few months. When the warrant was issued for the Miami native’s arrest in June, he had an attorney who secured him a $10,000 bond, including house arrest. But Brown never turned himself in.”The charges stem from a violent altercation in May during a celebrity boxing event hosted by streamer Adin Ross in Miami. Videos circulated online appearing to show Brown engaged in a heated confrontation with several people outside the venue. In one clip, the former Tampa Bay Buccaneers receiver was allegedly seen holding a black pistol and chasing someone before a gunshot rang out, sending bystanders fleeing.According to the arrest warrant obtained by The Washington Post, police reviewed surveillance footage showing Brown punching a man, which “sparked a melee.”The report also stated that Brown allegedly took a gun from a security guard before running after the same individual. The victim was later identified as Zul-Qarnain Kwame Nantambu, who gained attention earlier this year for waving a Palestinian flag during Kendrick Lamar’s Super Bowl halftime performance.Authorities charged Brown with attempted second-degree murder with a firearm—a felony that could carry a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison and a $10,000 fine under Florida law. Legal experts note that while sentencing can vary based on intent and prior offenses, prosecutors may push for a tougher penalty given Brown’s history of legal troubles.The former NFL star’s career once glittered with achievements. During his prime with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Brown twice led the league in receptions and receiving yards. But his success was overshadowed by off-field controversies, including sexual misconduct lawsuits, battery charges, and multiple arrests.Now, Brown’s latest case could mark a defining moment in a tumultuous post-football life. If convicted on the top charge, the once-celebrated Super Bowl champion may spend more than a decade behind bars—an ending few could have imagined for one of the NFL’s most electrifying talents.","Antonio Brown has been extradited to the U.S. to face attempted murder charge.

Tyler Oliveira says backlash and threats forced him to cancel his film





YouTuber Tyler Oliveira said he will not release his documentary about India’s poop-throwing festival. He posted this on his X account two hours ago. Oliveira said he was doxxed and threatened by thousands of Indians after he filmed the event. He said people also targeted his family, turning his life “into a living hell.” The festival he filmed is called the Gorehabba cow-dung festival, celebrated in Gumatapura village in Karnataka after Diwali.In his post, Oliveira said he never meant to insult India’s culture or religion, but only wanted to show the unique tradition to the world. However, his short teaser video called “Inside India’s Poop-Throwing Festival” drew massive backlash online, with many Indians calling it offensive and disrespectful. After days of threats, Oliveira said he would stop and not publish the full documentary.Tyler Oliveira explained that he went to Gumatapura to film a local tradition where villagers throw dried cow dung as part of a festive ritual. The event is a real religious tradition connected to the worship of a local deity.Oliveira shared clips online wearing a protective suit, which quickly went viral. But the reaction was harsh, many people accused him of mocking Indian culture and showing it as a joke.In his long post, Tyler Oliveira said, “I have been doxxed and threatened by thousands of Indians. My family has been attacked in ways I never could have imagined.” He also added that he had underestimated India’s power and could not “fight against 1.5 billion people.”Oliveira said he was scared for his safety and his family’s safety. He also mentioned that visiting the festival was “the worst decision of [his] life.” He asked Indians to stop sending hate and said he only wanted to show the tradition to the world in a documentary.Many Indian news outlets reported on the issue, saying this shows how foreign creators must research and respect local customs before filming them. The Gorehabba festival has been celebrated for generations and is seen by villagers as a symbol of faith and togetherness, not a strange event.After the backlash, Tyler Oliveira said he would stop the project entirely. He said he could not continue this “war” and would move on to other work. He ended his message by saying, “I never meant to offend anyone. Please leave my family alone.”Also Read: Sneako Admires Zohran Mamdani And Wife Rama Duwaji’s Real Love And The Internet Falls For Their Charm","YouTuber Tyler Oliveira says he will not release his documentary about India's poop-throwing festival.

CSMT protest chaos: Railway workers’ stir sparks rush-hour mayhem; 2 commuters mowed down by passing train,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/2-lives-lost-after-flash-protest-at-mumbais-csmt-brings-suburban-services-to-a-halt-for-nearly-an-hour/articleshow/125138913.cms,"The crowd at CSMT at 6.58pm. The protest by CR employees began around 4.30pm and gained momentum an hour later as they blocked the motormen’s lobby, leading to services being stopped for over an hour





MUMBAI: Chaos gripped Central Railway's (CR) Main line on Thursday evening after a flash protest by railway employees at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) brought suburban services to a standstill for nearly an hour during peak travel time. The disruption had a tragic fallout — two commuters lost their lives and three more sustained serious injuries after being hit by a local train near Sandhurst Road station, as stranded passengers began walking along the tracks amid severe overcrowding.Hailey Momaiya, 19, and an unknown male commuter were pronounced dead at J J Hospital.Yafisa Chogle, 62, Khusbu Momaiya, 45, and Kaif Chogle, 22, suffered injuries and were brought to J J Hospital. Of these, Yafisa and Khusbu were admitted while Kaif who had suffered pain in the abdomen, refused admission.Scores of passengers got down from trains that had halted for nearly an hour as a result of the protest and started to walk on tracks. ""These five passengers got off a stalled Up slow local and were walking on the tracks when a down fast local hit them at 6.50pm,"" said a police official.The flash protest was triggered by an FIR lodged by the Government Railway Police (GRP) against two CR engineers in connection with the June 9 Mumbra accident, in which five commuters had fallen from a moving train.The agitation, which began around 4.30pm, gathered momentum in the CSMT concourse area around 5.30pm, when employees assembled outside the motormen's lobby, blocking the exit of train crew and paralysing operations. Services gradually resumed around 6.45pm, but the one-hour disruption left thousands stranded across the network.S K Dube, divisional secretary of the Central Railway Mazdoor Sangh (CRMS), said the agitation was held to oppose what the union termed an ""unjustified FIR"" based on a technically flawed report of VJTI. ""Based on its report, two employees were booked under inappropriate sections. We served a notice demanding that the FIR be withdrawn,"" he said.Dube added that the protest was suspended following intervention by senior officials. CR's Chief Public Relations Officer Swapnil Nila said, ""Divisional railway manager Hiresh Mina and other senior officials counselled the agitators, explaining that the protest was inconveniencing commuters, after which the agitation was called off at 6.45pm.""As trains stood still on platforms, angry passengers at Masjid Bunder and Dockyard Road stations alighted and began walking on the tracks. The GRP and RPF deployed additional personnel to manage crowds but refrained from taking action against the protesters. ""Since 5.41pm, CR locals were standing still. The 5.52pm Kalyan local finally departed at 6.40pm,"" said a commuter.Deepika Shinde, a Kalwa resident, said, ""There were no announcements and people were getting restless.""Vijeeta Nitesh from Kanjurmarg added, ""If the unions wanted to protest, they should have done it at the GRP office, not by halting trains.""Mangala Jhingade, who was headed to Byculla to distribute her daughter's wedding invitations, said, ""People were jumping onto the tracks. Who will take responsibility if someone gets hurt?""The impact of the CSMT protest was also felt at Thane, where massive crowds choked all platforms. Around 6.30pm, some passengers attempted to stage a protest at platform number 3 after a CSMT-bound local was short-terminated at Thane and converted into a Thane-Karjat special. The cancellation angered Mumbai-bound commuters, though officials said the move was essential to manage the rush of passengers travelling towards Kalyan.""Railway police had to intervene and disperse the crowd before allowing the train to depart around 7pm,"" said a local official, adding that an additional police team was deployed as a safety measure.A Kalyan-bound commuter said he had waited nearly an hour before finally hiring an autorickshaw at an exorbitant fare to reach his outstation train.Passenger activists from Thane condemned the protest. ""The CRMS obstructing passenger movement and staging protests at railway stations during peak hours is highly condemnable. Such actions not only disrupt essential services but also endanger the lives of thousands of daily commuters,"" said Siddhesh Desai of the Mumbai Rail Pravasi Sangh.A total of 30 trains were cancelled and a similar number delayed due to the protest.Senior Central Railway officials questioned the FIR's conclusions, calling them ""technically flawed and based on wrong presumptions"". They said the GRP had engaged VJTI as a technical expert, but the institute lacked expertise in railway track geometry.CR officials countered the FIR's premise, stating, ""If the track had been unstable or unwelded, it would have caused a derailment, not passengers falling."" An internal CR inquiry concluded that the Mumbra incident occurred when commuters standing on the footboards of two passing trains brushed against each other, causing a chain reaction. ""We will contest the matter in court,"" an official said.",Two commuters died and three more sustained serious injuries after being hit by a local train near Sandhurst Road station. The disruption had a tragic fallout as stranded passengers began walking along the tracks amid severe overcrowding.

Govt will continue to work closely with the police and tourism stakeholders to promote responsible tourism,” tourism minister Rohan Khaunte said.For complaints or assistance, the department has urged visitors and residents to contact the 24x7 tourism helpline at 1364.","A video from Arambol beach showed a group of men forcing two foreign women to pose for photographs.

US Supreme Court skeptical of Trump tariffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-supreme-court-skeptical-of-trump-tariffs/articleshow/125138764.cms,".

Donald Trump’s Trade Weapon Tested: US Supreme Court Weighs Limits of Emergency Powers, Authority





In a marathon 2½-hour session that exposed fissures in the Trump administration's trade agenda, the US Supreme Court on Wednesday grilled lawyers over Trump tariffs imposed under a 1977 emergency powers law, with even conservative justices expressing skepticism over presidential powers in the matter.Neal Katyal, the Indian-American litigator leading the case for small businesses, delivered a forceful defence of congressional primacy, earning praise from legal scholars even as justices from both ideological flanks voiced doubts about the policy's legality. The case, consolidated as Trump vs VOS Selections Inc. and Learning Resources, Inc. vs Trump, could redefine executive authority in an era of economic nationalism.President Trump has warned several times that the case is a “matter of life and death” for the US and if the court ruled against his powers to tariff, “we could end up being a third-world country.” Countries and businesses across the world, not to speak of American business and industry, are watching the case -- many in person -- given its enormous import on global trade and commerce.“If our country was not able to protect itself by using tariffs against tariffs, we would be ‘dead,’ with no chance of survival or success,” Trump said in one of several posts on the case which he once intended to attend personally but dropped the idea because it would be a distraction.Katyal, a Yale Law School alum with over 50 Supreme Court arguments under his belt, opened with a stark declaration before the court: ""Tariffs are taxes,"" and only the Congress is constitutionally empowered to impose them. Representing importers like VOS Selections, a family-run wine and spirits firm, and educational toy makers battered by rates up to 145% on Chinese goods, he argued the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) authorises embargoes and quotas, not revenue-raising levies.""The founders gave that taxing power to Congress alone,"" Katyal said, invoking Article I of the Constitution and the nondelegation doctrine. He dismissed the administration's claim that IEEPA's ""regulate importation"" clause covers tariffs as ""fanciful,"" noting no president from Reagan to Obama had ever wielded it in that manner.The bench's reaction was a bipartisan fusillade, as it came down much harder on the government lawyer, solicitor general John Sauer, than on Katyal. Chief justice John Roberts, an institutionalist, zeroed in on IEEPA's silence on ""tariff,"" observing Congress has spelled out such powers elsewhere. Justice Neil Gorsuch, a textualist skeptic of executive overreach, also pressed Sauer on a ""one-way ratchet"" where Congress couldn't reclaim authority, musing it ""could swallow the Constitution. "" Both Roberts and Gorsuch are conservatives in a 6-3 supermajority that Trump has engineered.Legal luminaries hailed Katyal's performance as a masterclass, with Yale's Akhil Amar, Katyal's mentor and constitutional giant, saying, ""Neal channeled Madison – brilliant reclamation of Article I,"" while critics, including treasury secretary Scott Bessent, slammed it as ""foundational misunderstandings"" of trade goals.Several business leaders were present in the packed courtroom with lines forming before proceedings opened. A ruling is expected in December or January. A Katyal win could void many 2025 tariffs, triggering refunds – a ""logistical nightmare"" that conservative justice Amy Coney Barrett reflected on. Administration boffins have warned that even if the court rules against Trump they have a “plan b” to impose tariffs.The IEEPA duties, dubbed ""Liberation Day"" tariffs, have netted the US Treasury more than $ 100 billion, but critics say it is costing the average American household $ 1200 per year in increased prices. President Trump has rejected the estimates and insists that prices of essential goods and groceries have actually come down.On Thursday, he pointed to WalMart lowering its packaged Thanksgiving dinner for ten by 25 percent (to $ 40) to make his point.","Neal Katyal, the Indian-American litigator leading the case for small businesses, delivered a forceful defence of congressional primacy. President Trump has warned several times that the case is a “matter of life and death” for the US and if the court ruled against his powers to tariff, “we could end up being a third-world country”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125138801,imgsize-24902,width-400,resizemode-4/1280720-39.jpg"

I always told her, ‘I’m going to the NFL,’ and I made it,”

More coverage on Marshawn Kneeland



When the news broke that Dallas Cowboys defensive end Marshawn Kneeland had passed away at just 24, it sent shockwaves through the football world. On November 6, 2025, Marshawn was found dead in Frisco, Texas. Authorities say the sequence began with a vehicle pursuit after he evaded a traffic stop. He was later discovered in a wooded area near the crash site, and early reports suggest his death was from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. The official cause and manner of death remain under investigation by the Texas Department of Public Safety and the Collin County Medical Examiner’s Office.But beyond the stats and highlight reels was a son whose entire journey was shaped by love especially from his late mother, Wendy, and his father, Shawn. The Michigan native often spoke about how his parents built the foundation for his NFL dream, one filled with faith, loss, and family devotion.Marshawn Kneeland was born on July 8, 2001, in Grand Rapids, Michigan, to parents Wendy and Shawn Kneeland. He grew up surrounded by family - his siblings AJ, Shawn Michael, and Yahmya and attended Godwin Heights High School in Wyoming, Michigan.Wendy Kneeland was the beating heart of Marshawn’s story. She wasn’t just a supportive mom, she was his motivation.In interviews, Marshawn recalled how she drove him to every training session and kept him grounded when college pressures hit. But in February 2024, tragedy struck: Wendy passed away, just as Marshawn was preparing for the NFL Combine.Her death was devastating, yet Marshawn turned his grief into strength. He carried some of her ashes in a small urn necklace, a symbol of her constant presence. “he once said proudly. For him, every snap, every tackle, and every touchdown was for Wendy. Her belief in him didn’t end with her passing, it lived on through his success.While Wendy was his emotional compass, Marshawn’s father, Shawn, was his steady anchor. A more private figure, Shawn supported his son in quieter ways, helping him stay focused through high school position changes, college transitions, and life after his mother’s passing.Shawn rarely appeared in interviews, but his presence was constant. After Wendy’s death, he became Marshawn’s biggest emotional support system, helping hold the family together through immense loss. Those who knew the Kneelands described Shawn as “the calm in the storm,” the kind of dad who let actions speak louder than words.Marshawn’s journey from Grand Rapids to the Dallas Cowboys was more than athletic achievement, it was a love story between a son and his parents. He fulfilled the promise he made to his mom and carried his father’s quiet lessons of resilience every step of the way.Even in his short career, Marshawn’s story touched hearts because it reflected something universal, the power of family. Behind the helmet and headlines was a young man shaped by the love of two parents who gave him everything, including the strength to chase greatness.","Marshawn Kneeland was born on July 8, 2001, in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

Overriding Biden-era rules: US Supreme Court backs Trump admin's passport gender policy — what it means,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-supreme-court-allows-trump-to-restrict-passport-gender-marker-changes-for-trans-and-non-binary-people-what-it-means/articleshow/125147714.cms,"Donald Trump’s Trade Weapon Tested: US Supreme Court Weighs Limits of Emergency Powers, Authority

Sex markers on passports and changes to gender marker policies during Biden reign





What it means for transgender?









The Supreme Court on Thursday allowed US President Donald Trump’s administration to enforce a policy blocking transgender and nonbinary people from choosing passport sex markers that aligned with their gender identity.The decision, issued on the court’s emergency docket, permits the policy to remain in effect while a lawsuit over it proceeds.A lower-court order had required the government to continue letting applicants select male, female, or X on new or renewed passports to correspond with their gender identity. The Supreme Court’s three liberal justices dissented from the unsigned, conservative-majority order, AP news agency reported.“Displaying passport holders’ sex at birth no more offends equal protection principles than displaying their country of birth,” the unsigned order stated. “In both cases, the government is merely attesting to a historical fact without subjecting anyone to differential treatment.”In dissent, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said the policy made transgender people vulnerable to “increased violence, harassment, and discrimination”.She added, “This court has once again paved the way for the immediate infliction of injury without adequate (or, really, any) justification,” and noted the policy derived directly from Trump’s executive order that described transgender identity as “false” and “corrosive”.The Supreme Court majority held that preventing enforcement of the policy would harm the govt because passports fall within foreign affairs, a domain of executive-branch control. The dissenting justices countered that it was unclear how individual identification documents affected national foreign policy.The State Department altered its passport rules after Trump issued an executive order in January declaring the United States would “recognise two sexes, male and female” based on birth certificates and “biological classification”.Sex markers began appearing on passports in the mid-1970s and the federal govt started allowing them to be changed with medical documentation in the early 1990s, the plaintiffs said in court documents.A 2021 change under then-President Joe Biden, a Democrat, removed documentation requirements and allowed nonbinary people to choose an X gender marker after years of litigation.A judge blocked the Trump administration policy in June after a lawsuit from nonbinary and transgender people, some of whom said they were afraid to submit applications.An appeals court left the judge’s order in place. Solicitor General D John Sauer then turned to the Supreme Court, pointing to its recent ruling upholding a ban on transition-related healthcare for transgender minors and calling the Biden-era policy inaccurate.The plaintiffs, who challenged the policy, argue these passports are inaccurate and can be unsafe for those whose gender expression does not match the documents.“Forcing transgender people to carry passports that out them against their will increases the risk that they will face harassment and violence,” Jon Davidson, senior counsel for the ACLU’s LGBTQ and HIV Project, said.“This is a heartbreaking setback for the freedom of all people to be themselves, and fuel on the fire the Trump administration is stoking against transgender people and their constitutional rights.”Transgender actor Hunter Schafer said in February that her new passport had been issued with a male gender marker, despite her having been marked female on her driver’s licence and previous passports.","US President Donald Trump’s administration can enforce a policy blocking transgender and nonbinary people from choosing passport sex markers that aligned with their gender identity.

Irish police got a call about a lion. It was actually a dog named mouse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/irish-police-got-a-call-about-a-lion-it-was-actually-a-dog-named-mouse/articleshow/125147743.cms,"



John O'Reilly, a forest manager in western Ireland, could hardly believe his eyes when he saw the grainy video on his phone, sent to him by a truck driver. There, slinking through the woodlands of County Clare, in Ireland, was the impossible: A stocky, tan-coloured animal with a shaggy mane and tufted tail, lumbering into the trees and then out of view.""You're saying, 'Christ, that couldn't be what it looks like,'"" O'Reilly recalled. A lion? The video began spreading on news sites and social media in Ireland, prompting both speculation and scepticism.After nearly a week, Ireland's police force, known as An Garda Siochana, solved the confounding case. The creature was no apex predator. It was a shaggy Newfoundland dog. Its name? Mouse.""Gardai from Killaloe have concluded that the recent video of a 'lion like' animal roaming around the woods in East Clare is in fact the very friendly dog named 'Mouse',"" police said in a post on social platform X, along with photos of a calm, docile dog, whose shaved fur resembled a lion's mane and tail.Despite the proximity to Halloween, it's still unclear why Mouse had been groomed to look like a lion. Veterinary doctors do not recommend shaving water dogs like Newfoundlands, whose coats protect them from the elements.It is the amusing end to a saga that O'Reilly said began weeks ago, when construction crews and workers in the East Clare area noticed a large animal moving among the trees. They assumed it was a deer or a trick of the light, he said.And then came that video, from the truck driver. O'Reilly, who runs a private forest-management company in neighbouring County Meath, said he decided to report the video to the Gardai because of safety concerns. Police, as perplexed as anyone at the apparent sight of a lion in Ireland, initially asked O'Reilly if it could have been made with artificial intelligence, he said.The video could've been ""everything from a dog, to a wannabe Al Pacino in Scarface keeping an animal in the woods to protect his grow house,"" O'Reilly said of the possibilities he considered - adding that it wouldn't be the first time an exotic animal was found roaming the island.It wouldn't even be the first lion - in a 1951 incident that is now island lore, a lioness escaped from a lion tamer's home in Dublin, where it was once legal to keep the large cats. The lioness mauled a city teenager before being shot by police.Lions have not inhabited the European continent in thousands of years. But the Irish, ironically, once cultivated a reputation for breeding the captive wildcats, which were marquee items of many circuses and shows in the mid-century. The famed MGM lion, with his luxurious mane, bore the Irish name Cairbre and was born at the Dublin zoo.","A truck driver sent a grainy video to a forest manager in western Ireland.

Pelosi’s Viral ‘No Kings’ Crown-Smashing Act Triggers Uproar Across Political Circles





SAN FRANCISCO: Rep. Nancy Pelosi announced Thursday that she will retire when her term concludes in early 2027, ending a remarkable career in which she rose to become one of the most powerful women in American history.Pelosi, 85, was the nation's first and only female House speaker, and she will have represented San Francisco in Congress for 39 years when she leaves office. She has served during an era of seismic change for American society and her own city, from the throes of the AIDS crisis to the legalization of same-sex marriage, and through the meteoric rise of the tech sector and the nation's extreme polarization.She entered political office later in life and became a hero to Democrats for the way she wielded immense power to push the Affordable Care Act, climate change legislation and infrastructure programs through Congress.""With a grateful heart, I look forward to my final year of service as your proud representative,"" she told her constituents in a nearly six-minute video posted on X early Thursday, with clips of San Francisco's iconic cable cars and colorful Victorian homes flashing in the background.""My message to the city I love is this: San Francisco, know your power,"" she continued. ""We have always led the way, and now we must continue to do so by remaining full participants in our democracy and fighting for the American ideals we hold dear.""Pelosi, who likes to use the phrase ""resting is rusting,"" led the House Democrats for 20 years, eight of which she spent as speaker. She has also been a prodigious fundraiser and raised more than $1.3 billion for Democratic campaigns, according to her aides.But she was reviled by conservatives, who painted her as the scary embodiment of liberal San Francisco values and blamed her for what they considered the nation's decline.She has been a chief irritant to President Donald Trump, even to this day, calling him ""a vile creature"" in a CNN interview that aired this week. She presided over two of his impeachment votes in the House. And he has called her ""Crazy Nancy,"" with no sense of fondness for his foe.Her Democratic colleagues said she was unlike any other politician with whom they had worked. Jackie Speier, a Bay Area Democrat who served in the House for 15 years, said that Pelosi would go down in history ""as the most consequential speaker ever.""""She has a command, a presence. All eyes turn to her,"" Speier said.Her retirement had been grist for the local and national political rumor mill for several years, and younger Democrats grew increasingly eager to run for her seat. They feared, however, that it would be folly to challenge one of the most powerful politicians in modern history.Pelosi, for her part, told CNN days ago that she had no doubt she would win reelection if she were to run for another term.Still, the overwhelming defeat Democrats suffered last year in the congressional and presidential races has prompted soul-searching within the party -- and louder calls for older Democrats to step down and make way for new politicians with fresh ideas.The race to succeed Pelosi was already shaping up to be a fierce one before she announced her retirement. Scott Wiener, a Democratic state senator from San Francisco who is a champion of housing construction, and Saikat Chakrabarti, who worked as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's chief of staff, have already announced they were running for the seat -- with or without Pelosi on the ballot.In recent months, Pelosi has refused to discuss her career plans, insisting she was focused solely on the passage of California's Proposition 50, a ballot measure to approve newly drawn House districts. She worked behind the scenes to help Gov. Gavin Newsom craft the measure, which passed Tuesday, and to raise money for the effort.It was considered one of her final achievements, both a blow to Trump, who had sought more Republican seats in the House by gerrymandering in conservative states, and a parting gift to the next generation of California Democrats who could benefit from as many as five additional seats in the state.Trump still has strong contempt for Pelosi.""The retirement of Nancy Pelosi is a great thing for America,"" he said Thursday in a response to Fox News. ""She was evil, corrupt and only focused on bad things for our country.""At a packed union hall in San Francisco on Monday morning, Pelosi was the emcee for a Proposition 50 rally that included Newsom and labor leader Dolores Huerta.""This is a moment of truth for America,"" Pelosi told the crowd. ""It's self-defense for our democracy.""In the audience, union workers wore T-shirts that Pelosi had autographed for them and pins with drawings of six tiny Nancy Pelosis standing side by side, each wearing a suit in a different color of the rainbow.At the rally, the ever-stylish Pelosi was sporting a green corduroy suit and green stilettos, never mind the fall she took in December on a marble staircase in Luxembourg that forced her to get a hip replacement and remain stuck for several months in dreaded flats.Pelosi's career in elected office has been a long one, but it did not span even half her life. Born into a politically powerful family of Democrats in Baltimore -- her father and brother each served as the city's mayor -- Pelosi went the more traditional route for women of her age.At first, anyway.She met her husband, Paul Pelosi, at Georgetown University, and the couple moved to his hometown, San Francisco, where she stayed home to raise their five children. During that time, Pelosi grew his career as a venture capitalist.As a young mother, Nancy Pelosi found a way to support the Democratic Party by opening up the family's large home for fundraisers. That led to friendships with a host of prominent San Francisco Democrats in the 1970s and 1980s, including Willie Brown, Jerry Brown and Phil and John Burton, brothers who served in Congress.Her connections and fundraising prowess helped her get elected as the first woman to chair the California Democratic Party.When Rep. Phil Burton died in office, his wife, Sala Burton, replaced him. Sala Burton was soon after diagnosed with cancer and told Pelosi she wanted her to run for the seat. Pelosi, who had shrugged off other suggestions to run for elected office, finally agreed.A special election was held in June 1987, and Pelosi, then 47, edged out Harry Britt, a gay socialist who had worked as an aide to Harvey Milk, the San Francisco supervisor who was assassinated at City Hall in 1978.Cleve Jones, who also worked for Milk and who created the AIDS Memorial Quilt, had backed Britt. Jones recalled in an interview that he initially had dismissed Pelosi as ""a society lady.""""I had the most wrong first impression of Nancy Pelosi,"" he said. ""I just didn't take her very seriously.""But he said his view changed when Pelosi used her first floor speech in the House to talk about the AIDS crisis as the Reagan administration largely ignored it. That same year, she helped Jones get his quilt installed on the National Mall in Washington.In 1990, she fought for the passage of an act named after Ryan White , a teenager who contracted HIV from a blood transfusion and was banned from his school after his diagnosis. The program paid for health care for HIV/AIDS patients who lacked medical coverage.""She's just always been there,"" Jones said. ""She's more than an ally. She's family.""Barbara Boxer, who represented a different part of San Francisco in the House and later became a U.S. senator, said in an interview that she and Pelosi were constantly confused for each other and lumped together as ""the two women from San Francisco.""They bonded by sitting next to each other during countless flights home. Boxer praised her friend's unique combination of her social justice values, driven by her Catholic faith, and her tactical ability to know every facet of every bill and exactly where each member stood on it.Together, they persuaded the federal government to dump a plan to turn San Francisco's military base, the Presidio, into condominiums. Instead, the government preserved it as a national park.Karen Bass, the mayor of Los Angeles who served in Congress alongside Pelosi, said her colleague was a ""masterful leader"" who listened to widespread dissent in her caucus, but used her smarts and persuasion to repeatedly corral them and win key votes.""I was in awe watching her,"" she said.Pelosi's rise -- and her wins on Capitol Hill -- made her a regular target for conservatives. During the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, some rioters made a beeline for her office, tore down her wooden nameplate and broke into her chambers. One man, who was later prosecuted, was seen sitting in her chair with his feet propped up on her desk in a display of defiance.The next year, in October 2022, her husband was brutally attacked in the Pelosi home by a man living in the Bay Area who seemed obsessed with right-wing conspiracy theories.On Monday, however, Paul Pelosi was at the union hall with his wife, appearing healthy.At the Proposition 50 rally, Newsom thanked Nancy Pelosi for her work on the ballot measure.""Some people go off and they talk about the way the world should be, but they don't do anything to damn manifest it,"" he said. ""Nancy Pelosi doesn't go out to try to make points. She makes a difference.""Pelosi stood behind him, beaming. Then, she exited the stage.","Pelosi, 85, was the nation's first and only female House speaker. She will have represented San Francisco in Congress for 39 years when she leaves office. She has served during an era of seismic change for American society and her own city. She became a hero to Democrats for the way she wielded immense power.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125147678,imgsize-70868,width-400,resizemode-4/pelosi-plans-to-retire-in-2027-after-39-years-in-congress.jpg"
'Eight planes shot down': Donald Trump adds one more plane in his India-Pakistan ceasefire claim; gives new details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/eight-planes-shot-down-donald-trump-adds-one-more-plane-in-his-india-pakistan-ceasefire-claim-gives-new-details/articleshow/125128014.cms,"“7-8 Planes Down…” Trump Repeats Ceasefire Claims On India-Pak War





US President Donald Trump has once again reiterated his old claim that India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire after his intervention.Speaking at an event in Miami, Florida, on Wednesday, Trump added new details to his claims, saying that after his intervention, the next day he received a call claiming that they had made peace after he put out trade conditions.Trump claimed he had solved eight wars in the nine months he had been in office and played a key role in bringing India and Pakistan to a truce. “You know, I was in the midst of a trade deal with both of them (India and Pakistan), and then I read on the front page of a certain newspaper... I heard they were going to war,"" PTI news agency quoted Trump as saying, adding that a total of eight planes had been shot down during the military conflict.His previous claim stood at seven.“I said, this is war, and they are going at it. And they are two nuclear nations. I said, ‘I'm not going to make any trade deals with you guys unless you agree to peace,"" Trump said, adding that his statement took both India and Pakistan by shock.""The two nations said 'No way. This has nothing to do...’ I said, ‘It has everything to do. You are nuclear powers. I'm not trading with you. We're not making any deals with you if you're at war with each other'.""As per the claim made by Trump, this conversation with India and Pakistan took place on May 9. On May 10-2025, both countries announced they had come to a ceasefire understanding and would stop all fighting.""A day later, I get a call saying, 'We made peace'. They stopped. I said, 'Thank you. Let's do trade'. Isn't that great? Tariffs did that… Without tariffs, that would have never happened,"" Trump said amid applause.Trump’s tariff announcement had imposed a 25 percent levy on India in response to what he described as ""the highest tariffs on US goods"" and a 19 percent tariff on Pakistan. He later added an extra 25 percent on India, taking the total to 50 percent, as a penalty for New Delhi’s purchase of Russian oil and its participation in the BRICS bloc, which, according to Trump, fostered anti-American policies.India has repeatedly denied US involvement in the truce. During the G7 Summit in Canada earlier this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi rejected Trump’s claim.“President Trump clearly that during this period, there was no talk at any stage on subjects like India-US trade deal or US mediation between India and Pakistan,” said Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri in a press statement.The conflict between India and Pakistan escalated after New Delhi launched a tri-service strike called ‘ Operation Sindoor ’, targeting terror camps across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. The operation followed a terror attack in April in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam, in which 26 tourists were killed.","US President Donald Trump has once again reiterated his old claim that India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire after his intervention.

'Was stuck in international waters': US carries out 'lethal kinetic strike' on drug vessel; watch video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/was-stuck-in-international-waters-us-carries-out-lethal-kinetic-strike-on-drug-vessel-watch-video/articleshow/125148697.cms,"U.S. Strike Leaves Trail Of Fire, Alleged Venezuelan Drug Boat Blown Apart | 16th Hit In Campaign

Two days earlier: Another strike in the Pacific





Expanding military presence and legal debate





Political reaction and regional tensions









The United States on Friday carried out another “lethal kinetic strike” on a drug trafficking vessel in the Caribbean, killing three individuals described by Washington as “narco-terrorists. ”US war secretary Pete Hegseth shared a video of the strike on X and said, “As we’ve said before, vessel strikes on narco-terrorists will continue until their poisoning of the American people stops. Today, at the direction of President Trump, the Department of War carried out a lethal kinetic strike on a vessel operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization.”“The vessel was trafficking narcotics in the Caribbean and was struck in international waters. No US forces were harmed in the strike, and three male narco-terrorists — who were aboard the vessel — were killed,” Hegseth said. He added a warning: “To all narco-terrorists who threaten our homeland: if you want to stay alive, stop trafficking drugs. If you keep trafficking deadly drugs—we will kill you.”The latest operation marks the continuation of an intensified maritime campaign launched by the US in early September, targeting what it calls “narco-terrorist” vessels across international waters.Two days prior, the US carried out a similar strike in the eastern Pacific, killing two people aboard another alleged drug vessel. That operation was part of a campaign that, according to official statements, has now destroyed 17 vessels — including a semi-submersible — and resulted in at least 66 deaths.“Today, at the direction of President Trump, the Department of War carried out a lethal kinetic strike on a vessel operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization (DTO),” Hegseth wrote in a post on X, confirming that “intelligence confirmed that the vessel was involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics.”The strikes have been conducted primarily in international waters across the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. Washington has not yet publicly provided evidence that the targeted boats posed an imminent threat to the United States.The operations come amid the deployment of an American aircraft carrier to the region, a move analysts view as an expansion of US military presence across Caribbean waters. President Donald Trump has described the strikes as actions within an “armed conflict” against drug cartels, arguing that these groups are “foreign terrorist organisations.”“We will find and terminate EVERY vessel with the intention of trafficking drugs to America to poison our citizens,” Hegseth wrote in another post. “Protecting the homeland is our TOP priority. NO cartel terrorist stands a chance against the American military.”However, legal and human rights experts have criticised the operations as extrajudicial killings, pointing out that the US has not provided a clear legal framework or justification for the strikes, even when the targets are identified drug traffickers. Lawmakers from both parties have demanded greater transparency and a formal explanation for the campaign’s scope and legality.Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who remains under US indictment on narcoterrorism charges, accused Washington of “fabricating a war” against him as American strikes move closer to his country’s maritime borders.When asked on CBS’s “60 Minutes” whether the US was heading toward war with Venezuela, Trump said, “I doubt it. I don’t think so.” He also agreed that Maduro’s “days are numbered” but declined to say whether he would authorise land strikes.The series of strikes underscores Washington’s renewed militarised approach to narcotics interdiction, marking a sharp escalation in US counter-narcotics operations across international waters — and raising questions about the boundaries of its campaign under international law.","U.S. carried out another “lethal kinetic strike” on a drug trafficking vessel in the Caribbean, killing three individuals described by Washington as “narco- terrorists” The latest operation marks the continuation of an intensified maritime campaign launched by the US in early September. Washington has not yet publicly provided evidence that the targeted boats posed an imminent threat to the United States. Legal and human rights experts have criticised the operations as extrajudicial killings.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125148719,imgsize-287071,width-400,resizemode-4/us-strike-on-venezuelan-vessel.jpg"
'Incredibly sad time': Three UPS pilots among 12 dead in UPS plane crash; investigation underway,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/incredibly-sad-time-three-ups-pilots-among-12-dead-in-ups-plane-crash-investigation-underway/articleshow/125147645.cms,"Shocking Video: UPS Cargo Plane Explodes After Takeoff In Louisville | FAA, NTSB Probe Deadly Crash





UPS on Thursday identified the flight crew killed in a fiery plane crash on Tuesday at Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport (SDF) in Kentucky, which claimed the lives of 12 people and left nearly a dozen others injured.The three deceased UPS pilots on board Flight 2976 were identified as Capt. Richard Wartenberg, 1st Officer Lee Truitt, and International Relief Officer Capt. Dana Diamond, according to UPS Airlines executive vice president Nando Cesarone.""Our hearts go out to every UPSer who has been impacted and all in our Louisville community – supporting you and ensuring you receive the care and resources you need is our priority. This continues to be an incredibly sad time for our entire UPS family, and as our CEO, Carol Tomé reminded us: 'United, we are strong.' We extend our deepest sympathies to the family and friends of our colleagues, and to the loved ones of those in the Louisville community,"" the UPS said in a statement.“Words can’t express the sorrow we feel over the heartbreaking Flight 2976 accident,” Cesarone wrote in a statement on X.“Our hearts go out to every UPSer who has been impacted and all in our Louisville community— supporting you and ensuring you receive the care and resources you need is our priority.”The UPS cargo plane, which was loaded with about 38,000 gallons of fuel and bound for Hawaii, crashed into the nearby Kentucky Petroleum Recycling building after departing from SDF at about 5:15 p.m. ET Tuesday, according to Gov. Andy Beshear.At the time of the disaster, the oil recycling company had 29 above-ground storage tanks containing about 226 000 gallons of used motor oil and 37 000 gallons of oil-water-antifreeze mix, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). EPA on-scene coordinators confirmed several of the large, above-ground storage tanks at Kentucky Petroleum Recycling broke open and fell over. The facility remained closed while the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigated.Preliminary flight data indicated the aircraft’s last recorded elevation was 475 feet, and it was travelling at 183 knots at the time of the crash, according to NTSB officials. The EPA confirmed there was no hazardous material cargo on board the aircraft.At least 12 people were dead, including the three crew members on board and a young child, and 11 others on the ground were injured, Beshear said. Others were still unaccounted for.Though the cause of the crash had not yet been released, NTSB officials said Wednesday the left engine detached from the plane and was found on the airfield.On Thursday, the NTSB confirmed data was successfully recovered from the aircraft’s cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder, commonly known as the “black box,” at a Washington, D.C. lab. NTSB officials said the plane had been in San Antonio, Texas, for six weeks prior to the crash and that it may have been used as a replacement shortly before take-off due to maintenance issues with the originally scheduled aircraft.The EPA worked closely with state and local agencies, along with UPS, to clean up oil released into nearby streams that flow into the Salt and Ohio rivers. EPA officials said the agency would remain on site to ensure clean air, land and water for nearby residents.The NTSB confirmed the FBI was assisting with the investigation “under a longstanding Interagency agreement.”The Louisville airport is home to UPS Worldport, a global hub for the shipping company’s air cargo operations and its largest package-handling facility worldwide.","UPS on Thursday identified the flight crew killed in a fiery plane crash on Tuesday at Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport.

‘Sandwich guy’ acquitted: Who is Sean Dunn and how did he become the face of DC resistance?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/sandwich-guy-acquitted-who-is-sean-dunn-and-how-did-he-become-the-face-of-dc-resistance/articleshow/125147239.cms,"Who is Sean Dunn?

How did he became the face of DC resistance?





A US man, who threw a footlong sandwich at a federal officer, has been found not guilty and is today popularly known as a ""sandwich guy.""A video of Sean Charles Dunn, ""sandwich guy,"" throwing a sandwich at the officer's car has gone viral, showing him pointing and shouting at officers as they crossed the junction.“F*** you, fascists,” he yelled, then chanted “shame” before turning and walking away. “I don’t want you in my city,” he screamed at them. Minutes later, he returned, continued shouting and threw his sandwich — salami, the Washington Post reported.According to CNN, Dunn served as an international-affairs specialist in the United States Department of Justice Criminal Division. He was terminated following the sandwich incident.Attorney-General Pam Bondi announced his dismissal on social media as a warning to federal employees. In her statement Bondi said, ""This is an example of the Deep State we have been up against for seven months as we work to refocus DOJ. You will NOT work in this administration while disrespecting our government and law enforcement.""In the week since the sandwich was slung, Dunn’s likeness has appeared around the city and on social media.Memes and protest art have flooded Washington accounts. At demonstrations, protesters held Subway sandwiches aloft as a symbol of defiance, and shirts bearing his image are now on sale.He’s also become the face of DC’s resistance to the law enforcement surge implemented by President Donald Trump’s administration, WTOP reported.In homage to graffiti artist Banksy’s “Flower Thrower,” images of Dunn throwing the sandwich started popping up on buildings around the District and T-shirts worn by Washingtonians.Speaking to some DC residents in front of “the sandwich thrower” image on Columbia Road in Adams Morgan, WTOP tried to find out why so many have thrown their support behind Dunn.“I think it’s more of like a folk hero thing,’’ Connor told WTOP. “He’s just sort of a symbol for the emotion that everybody is feeling, watching people get abducted off the streets and mistreated and manhandled.”“Whoever came up with that transposition, I mean, that’s a brilliant piece of street art,” said Jeffrey Ian Ross, a criminologist at the University of Baltimore specialising in graffiti and street art, Washington Post reported.“And it will be one of several. When somebody writes the history of this period, that will definitely be one of the iconic images that comes out of it.”Ross described the episode as a “perfect storm” for virality, noting the irony of Dunn’s federal employment and the high-profile felony charge. He added that the slapstick nature of a thwacking sandwich and a flat-footed police chase made the incident particularly memorable.Rochester-based artist Adam Goldfarb, who lived in the DC area for 15 years, has designed shirts featuring a cartoon hoagie over the word “resist”, complete with an eye patch. “Nobody wants to waste a sandwich. But looking at this administration, the cruelty, the corruption, the disregard for basic democratic values and societal norms, it feels like, so often, there’s nothing we can do. So I totally understand this, ‘We just need to do something,’ and you’ve got a sandwich in your hand,” he said. He has not yet sold any of the shirts.","Sean Charles Dunn, who threw a footlong sandwich at a federal officer, has been found not guilty and is today popularly known as a ""sandwich guy"" Dunn served as an international-affairs specialist in the United States Department of Justice Criminal Division.

US jury finds 'sandwich guy' not guilty of assaulting border agent with sub,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-jury-finds-sandwich-guy-not-guilty-of-assaulting-border-agent-with-sub/articleshow/125147087.cms,"



A US protester who was charged for using a sandwich to assault a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agent was found ""not guilty"" on Thursday after a jury decided that charges brought by President Donald Trump’s prosecutors were baloney.The verdict in Washington Capitol Square came after 37-year-old Sean Dunn was accused of flinging a ""sub-style sandwich"" at an armed CBP officer on August 10 in a busy nightlife district following a barrage of shouted expletives, AP news agency reported.Prosecutors initially sought serious felony charges under a campaign ordered by President Trump to crack down on crime in the capital. However, a grand jury refused to indict Dunn on any felony count. A single misdemeanor charge was filed, carrying a maximum penalty of one year’s imprisonment.Dunn was chased and released immediately after the sandwich-throwing incident, only to be arrested later in a highly publicised White House-announced raid on his home.As video of the altercation went viral, he earned the nickname DC sandwich guy and became a symbol of resistance to the President’s law enforcement measures.Stylised images of him in mid-attack appeared on posters, graffiti, T-shirts and even as a popular Halloween costume.The top Trump-appointed prosecutor in Washington, Jeanine Pirro, has pursued maximum penalties for arrests since taking office, including in Dunn’s case. Media analysis of the President’s crime crackdown shows that many new arrests and indictments have stemmed from minor offences.At the trial’s opening on Monday, Judge Carl J Nichols said he expected proceedings to be brief, declaring ""this is the simplest case in the world."" Dunn’s defence did not dispute that he threw the sandwich, but argued that the act did not constitute an offence and described the prosecution as a ""blatant abuse of power.""Central to the trial was whether the tossing of a soft object could be deemed ""forcible"" and whether it impeded the officer’s duties. Dunn, then a Justice Department paralegal, was dismissed from his position after the incident.","Sean Dunn, 37, was accused of flinging a ""sub-style sandwich"" at an armed CBP officer on August 10 in a busy nightlife district.

SNAP benefits: US federal judge orders Trump administration to release full payments amid shutdown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/snap-benefits-us-federal-judge-orders-trump-administration-to-release-full-payments-amid-shutdown/articleshow/125146989.cms,"Trump’s SNAP Cuts Leave Millions Hungry Amid Shutdown; White House Announces 'Partial' Payments





SNAP recipients will now not go without food support, as a US federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to deliver full benefit payments to states by Friday.In Rhode Island on Thursday, US District Judge John J. McConnell Jr. ordered the administration to disburse the payments through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, though it was unlikely the 42 million Americans — about one in eight — would see the money on their food debit cards so swiftly, AP news agency reported.The order followed a challenge by cities and non-profit organisations that the administration had proposed covering only 65 per cent of the maximum benefit, which might leave some recipients without any payment this month.“The defendants failed to consider the practical consequences associated with this decision to only partially fund SNAP,” McConnell said. “They knew that there would be a long delay in paying partial SNAP payments and failed to consider the harms individuals who rely on those benefits would suffer.”McConnell was one of two judges who ruled last week that the administration could not skip November’s benefits entirely because of the federal shutdown.Last week’s rulings required the govt to use an emergency reserve fund containing $4.6 billion to pay for SNAP for November but gave it leeway to tap other money to make the full payments, which cost between $8.5 billion and $9 billion each month.On Monday, the administration said it would not use additional funds, arguing that Congress must appropriate the programme’s money. The following day, President Trump appeared to threaten withholding the benefits entirely unless Congressional Democrats agreed to reopen the government. His press secretary later clarified that partial benefits would be paid for November and that future payments were at risk if the shutdown persisted.Late on Wednesday, the USDA, which administers the programme, filed in federal court in Rhode Island that further analysis had shown the maximum benefit would amount to just 65 per cent of the usual sum.After the US federal government shut down at the start of October, Congress was unable to approve additional spending, resulting in states not receiving funds to top up participants’ SNAP cards. The programme worked by issuing reloadable debit cards that people could use to buy essential grocery items at supermarkets or via Amazon for grocery delivery. Although states administered the programme themselves, they relied heavily on funding from the federal govt.",US judge orders full benefits to be paid to 42 million Americans by Friday.

He also said that the script of the video in which he defended Tucker as a close friend of the Heritage Foundation was written by his chief of staff who has since resigned.Tucker Carlson sat down with Nick Fuentes for a two-hour interview where Carlson was seen gently disagreeing with Fuentes' statement that the loyalty of the Jewish people to the US is always a matter of suspicion. Carlson said it's not trie as many Jews have been critical of Israel but he railed against 'Christian Zionists' and called Texas Senator Ted Cruz and former president George W Bush victims of 'brain virus'.“If you sit there with someone who says Adolf Hitler was very, very cool and that their mission is to combat and defeat ‘global Jewry,’ and you say nothing, then you are a coward and you are complicit in that evil,” Ted Cruz attacked Carlson.",Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts apologized amid the row over his support for Tucker Carlson.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio went viral on Thursday after pointedly brushing off a group of reporters who attempted to question him as he walked into a classified national security briefing at the US Capitol. The exchange, captured on video and widely shared on X, shows Rubio declining to stop for comment, telling journalists, “I didn’t talk to you guys when I worked here. Why would I talk to you now?” The moment has drawn sharp reactions online, with supporters calling it a firm stance against the press and critics labelling it evasive.Rubio, confirmed unanimously as Secretary of State in January 2025 after serving more than a decade in the Senate, appears to be maintaining the limited media engagement style he adopted in recent years. While he was once a frequent presence in congressional hallway interviews, Rubio has increasingly framed off-the-cuff press questioning as unproductive.In the clip, a reporter is heard asking him to pause for cameras before the briefing. Rubio does not break stride, responding briefly before entering the secure area.

Country music singer Alexis Wilkins , the partner of FBI director Kash Patel , has now sued Sam Parker and sought $5 million in damages for calling her an Israeli spy on social media, Newsweek reported. Sam Parker is a former US Senate candidate in Utah who has been questioning Alexis Wilkins' background and allegiance and concluded that she is an Israeli spy who was possibly set up with Kash Patel by some other intel operative. Parker has 98.5K followers on X where he made a long thread on Wilkins proving that she works for PragerU and PragerU CEO Marissa Streit is 'definitely a spy'.Earlier, Wilkins sued Kyle Seraphin, a former FBI agent, for defamation with the same allegation that she is a spy.The lawsuit, filed in federal court, said Samuel Parker repeatedly lied about Alexis, falsely suggesting that she is an Israeli agent, assigned to manipulate and compromise FBI director Kash Patel. The lawsuit said that Parker is using a fabricated story as a fundraising clickbait.The lawsuit said Wilkins is a US citizen who was raised in Arkansas and now lives in Nashville. She is a Christian, American-born, US citizen who is unaffiliated with any intelligence agency, ""much less the government of Israel"", the lawsuit said, adding that Wilkins has never even been to Israel.Kash Patel had to issue a statement protesting the trolling of his girlfriend, which, in turn, got him some trolling as MAGA commentators were in disbelief that the FBI director had to issue a statement on his girlfriend.

Pakistan’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar has said that a symbolic “cup of tea” in Afghanistan’s capital, Kabul, turned out to be a costly mistake for Pakistan. He reiterated that such a mistake should never be repeated.Speaking in the Senate on Wednesday, Dar criticised the previous Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government, saying that under the pretext of that “cup of tea,” Pakistan had opened its borders to Afghanistan. He described this move as a serious error in judgment.“It was a big mistake and should not be repeated,” Dar said, news agency ANI reported, quoting Afghanistan’s Tolo News.Dar’s comments referred to the 2021 visit of the then-ISI chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, to Kabul shortly after the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan following the withdrawal of US and allied forces.Recalling his earlier remarks made in London last year, Dar said Pakistan was “still paying the price” for that decision.He linked the surge in terrorist attacks in Pakistan to militant groups allegedly operating from Afghan soil, including the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Fitna al-Khawarij, and the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), according to ARY News.Dar added that he had held six phone conversations with Afghanistan’s foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, to raise Pakistan’s concerns and demand that Afghan territory not be used for terrorist activities.However, Afghanistan’s ministry of foreign affairs has rejected Dar’s claim.In a post on X, ministry spokesperson Hafiz Zia Ahmad said the Pakistani minister’s statements “lacked accuracy,” clarifying that the phone conversation took place in a spirit of “mutual understanding and coordination.”""The recent statements by the Pakistani Foreign Minister, in which he claimed that the Foreign Minister of the Islamic Emirate in Afghanistan, Mullah Amir Khan Muttaqi, had contacted him six times in one day, lack accuracy and realism. In fact, the first phone contact between the two sides was aimed at mutual understanding and coordination,"" the post read.Ahmad further said Dar had initially mentioned not being fully briefed on the issue and would follow up after reviewing the matter.Despite the tensions, Dar expressed hope that upcoming talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan scheduled for November 6 in Istanbul would help strengthen cooperation on security issues.Last month, relations between the two neighbours deteriorated after Pakistan carried out airstrikes inside Afghan territory, prompting retaliatory fire from the Afghan side and intense border clashes.Following mediation by Qatar and Turkiye, both countries agreed to a ceasefire, which was later extended. The Istanbul meeting will focus on finalising steps for its continued implementation, according to the Turkish Foreign Ministry.","Pakistan’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar has said that a symbolic “cup of tea” in Afghanistan”s capital, Kabul, turned out to be a costly mistake for Pakistan.

We will try that it be tabled in accordance with principles, laws and the Constitution,” Dar said in the Senate, as quoted by PTI.According to sources, the proposed amendment includes provisions to set up a constitutional court, streamline the process for appointing the chief election commissioner, amend Article 243 dealing with matters of the armed forces, reduce the provinces’ share in federal resources, and transfer control of the education and population welfare ministries from provinces to the federal government.Article 243 of the Constitution states that “the federal government shall have control and command of the armed forces.” The proposal to revise this article is being viewed as a move that could further strengthen the position of Army Chief General Asim Munir and expand the military’s role in national affairs.Dar rejected concerns that the amendment might be passed without proper procedure. “It is not the case that the amendment is tabled and there is voting on it in a haphazard, ad hoc manner; this will not happen,” he said.He said the amendment would first be introduced in the Senate and then referred to a bipartisan committee for discussion, adding that the government would welcome positive suggestions to improve the draft.PPP Senator Raza Rabbani said the changes would damage provincial autonomy and “undo the good work of the 18th amendment,” which devolved powers to the provinces in 2010.The government has the required two-thirds majority in the 336-member National Assembly with the support of 233 members. In the 96-member Senate, it holds 61 seats and will need at least three opposition members to pass the amendment.The secrecy around the proposed changes, particularly the plan to amend Article 243, has drawn attention to whether the new constitutional move will give the armed forces greater influence in the country’s governance.","Pakistani government announces plans to introduce the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
