SC reserves judgment on Tamil Nadu's plea against governor for withholding assent to bills,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-reserves-judgment-on-tamil-nadus-plea-against-governor-for-withholding-assent-to-bills/articleshow/118128433.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday reserved its judgment on petitions filed by Tamil Nadu govt against governor RN Ravi for withholding assent for 12 bills which were sent to him after being passed by the state assembly and also questioned him on how he could refer bills to the President after they were resent by the House following reconsideration.A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan wound up proceedings after hearing the matter over four days. The court has formulated eight questions to be decided in the case pertaining to the role of a governor when a bill is sent to him for approval.The bench had earlier observed that the Tamil Nadu governor seemed to have ""devised his own procedure"" while withholding assent and then referring the bills to the President. Attorney general R Venkataramani, appearing for Ravi, had said there was no malice in his functioning as alleged by the state govt while taking decisions on bills sent to him and he was discharging his duty as per the law and the Constitution.""When a state govt introduces a bill before the legislative assembly and presents it before the governor for her assent and when the governor withholds assent, the bill in question falls through. This means the bill ceases to exist. In such a case, there is no requirement on the part of the governor to go through the procedure of the first proviso. The govt on their own also cannot go through the first proviso, when as a matter of fact the governor has not sent the bill for reconsideration,"" the AG had said.The first proviso says that the governor may, as soon as possible after the presentation of the bill to him for assent, return the bill if it is not a money bill together with a message requesting that the House reconsider the bill; and when a bill is so returned, the House shall reconsider it accordingly. It says that if the bill is passed again by the House with or without amendment and presented to the governor for assent, the governor shall not withhold assent therefrom.",Supreme Court reserved its judgment on petitions filed by Tamil Nadu govt against governor RN Ravi for withholding assent for 12 bills.

RAIPUR: At least 31 Maoist insurgents and two security personnel were killed Sunday in a fierce gunfight in the dense forests of Chhattisgarh's Bastar region, one of the last Naxal strongholds in the country. The operation is ongoing and officials expect the Maoist death toll to rise.This is the second-largest Maoist casualty count in a single security strike, after 38 guerrillas were gunned down in Narayanpur's Thulthuli on October 3 last year. Since 2024, more than 280 Maoists have been killed in Bastar. The number of Maoists killed this year has risen to 81 in just six weeks. Major operations include the killing of 16 Naxal fighters in Gariaband on Jan 21 and eight in Gangaloor on February 2. Security forces have also faced fatalities. On January 6, eight constables and a driver were killed when Maoists targeted their vehicle with an IED weighing nearly 70kg in Bijapur.Union home minister Amit Shah praised the security forces for the successful operation. ""The nation will always be indebted to these heroes.... I once again reaffirm that by March 31, 2026, we will eradicate Naxalism from the roots of this country so that no citizen loses their life due to it,"" he said. The gunfight erupted early Sunday after a contingent of over 650 security personnel launched a coordinated operation from multiple directions to hem in insurgents in the jungles of Bijapur's Indravati National Park.Intelligence reported the presence of a large group of Maoists and senior commanders.By late afternoon, 31 bodies of Maoist guerrillas had been recovered, Bastar deputy inspector general of police Kamlochan Kashyap said. Two securitymen were wounded, apart from the two killed.A large cache of Maoist weapons was seized, including AK-47s, SLRs, INSAS and .303 rifles, barrel grenade launchers (BGL) and explosives. Reinforcements have been dispatched to the site, nearly 150km from the district HQ and 420km from Raipur. Indravati was the site of another big operation on January 12, when security forces killed three Maoists. The park borders the Maoist headquarters of Abujhmarh, which straddles in states like Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra.The area has long served as a stronghold for insurgents, providing them with a safe zone for recruitment and inter-state movement.Chhattisgarh CM Vishnu Deo Sai declared that the state is transitioning from ""gun-tantra"" (rule of the gun) to ""gantantra"" (democracy).

Normalised Indian hate? Why Vivek Ramaswamy was fired from DOGE but Marko Elez wasn't,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/normalised-indian-hate-why-vivek-ramaswamy-was-fired-from-doge-but-marko-elez-wasnt/articleshow/118121642.cms,"A Controversy That Won’t Die

JD Vance’s Response: Gaslighting or Genuine Belief?

The Hypocrisy: Why Wasn’t Vivek Given the Same Grace?

The Big Balls Moment: Musk’s Flippant Justification

The Takeaway: Who Gets to Be Forgiven?

There’s something insidious about how Indian Americans are treated in political and media circles. It’s not the outright racism—the kind that fills anonymous message boards or fuels hate crimes. It’s the casual, smirking kind, the type that doesn’t invite consequences. It’s the racist joke that lands a TV deal. The meme that goes viral. The “funny” stereotype that Hollywood keeps recycling.And it’s the double standard in outrage. Vivek Ramaswamy , a billionaire entrepreneur who once seemed destined to become the brown face of MAGA , found himself unceremoniously ousted from his government role for saying things about America that the establishment didn’t like. No poll. No second chances. Just the door.Meanwhile, Marko Elez—a 25-year-old former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) staffer—posted “Normalize Indian Hate” on social media and was fired… before Elon Musk , backed by Vice President JD Vance , reinstated him after a poll on X. The same Musk who rants about cancel culture conveniently had no issue with Elez’s return.This isn’t just about Elez or Ramaswamy. It’s about how Indian Americans are treated in the public sphere: tolerated when useful, discarded when inconvenient.Elez’s tweet—“Normalize Indian Hate”—wasn’t some edgy joke. It was a straight-up racist proclamation, something that would have been career-ending if he had swapped “Indian” for any other group. Normalize Jewish Hate? Gone. Normalize White Hate? Fired. But Indian hate? A poll, some hand-wringing, and back in the office by Monday.Elez was initially forced out after the backlash but was quickly rehabilitated by Musk, who justified it with, “To err is human, to forgive divine.” Of course, forgiveness only applies when it’s a white conservative making the “mistake.”The contrast with Vivek Ramaswamy is impossible to ignore. The former biotech mogul turned MAGA cheerleader was dropped from DOGE, not for racism, not for corruption, but for questioning the establishment. Where was his second chance? Where was his poll?Indian Americans watching this unfold weren’t just angry. They were taking notes.When confronted about Elez’s reinstatement, JD Vance could have taken a stand. He could have said, “Yeah, actually, my wife and kids are Indian American, and I don’t think we should normalize hate against them.” Instead, he doubled down, framing the backlash as “emotional blackmail.”“For the sake of both of our kids? Grow up,” Vance scoffed on X. “Racist trolls on the internet, while offensive, don’t threaten my kids. You know what does? A culture that denies grace to people who make mistakes.”It was the kind of gaslighting that would make a Reddit therapist proud. The issue wasn’t that Elez had made a mistake—it was that his mistake wasn’t seen as a big deal.Congressman Ro Khanna asked the obvious question: ""Are you going to tell him to apologize for saying ‘ Normalize Indian Hate ’ before this rehire? Just asking for the sake of both of our kids.""Others were even less charitable. Journalist Wajahat Ali wrote: ""Your wife is Indian American. Your kids are Indian American. Elez said he wants to ‘normalize Indian hate.’ Have some pride, man. Have some dignity. For your family’s sake, you pathetic Reek.""Meanwhile, social media users pointed out the hypocrisy. One tweet summed it up perfectly: ""Say ‘Normalize hate against White people’ and see how the MAGA clowns react.""The disparity is glaring. Elez, a white staffer who posted outright racist content, gets a poll, a redemption arc, and a Musk pardon. Ramaswamy, an Indian American conservative who spent his career toeing the MAGA line, gets an unceremonious exit.The message to Indian American conservatives? You’re useful, but you’re not one of us.Harshil, an Indian-American commentator, put it bluntly: ""While Vivek Ramaswamy was deselected for DOGE, Elez has the backing of Vance for saying ‘Normalize Indian Hate.’ Indian-Americans, this is straight to your face. No matter how much you succeed, you will always be a second-class citizen.""Elon Musk’s “forgiveness” narrative collapses when held up against MAGA’s past behavior.When Black NFL players kneeled for the anthem, MAGA called for lifetime bans. When liberal figures made offensive remarks, MAGA demanded boycotts and firings. When an Indian-American MAGA figure was ousted, there was silence.Instead of acknowledging the gravity of the situation, Musk and his inner circle treated it as a joke. David Sacks, a venture capitalist close to Musk, summed up their attitude with this mock exchange:""Sir, the Pentagon has failed another audit.""""Send in Big Balls.""That’s how unserious they are about racism against Indian Americans. It’s all one big meme to them.For now, the message from Vance, Musk, and Trump couldn’t be clearer: Indian Americans in MAGA are valued for their usefulness, not their belonging. They can play the game, push the rhetoric, and even rise in the ranks, but when the chips are down, they will always be expendable. The Elez controversy isn’t just about one racist tweet—it’s a reminder that no matter how much loyalty Indian Americans show to the movement, it will never truly be reciprocated.","Marko Elez, a former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) staffer, posted “Normalize Indian Hate” on social media. He was initially forced out after the backlash but was quickly rehabilitated by Elon Musk, who justified it with, “To err is human, to forgive divine” The contrast with Vivek Ramaswamy is impossible to ignore.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118121715,imgsize-1370090,width-400,resizemode-4/118121715.jpg"
Elon Musk backs British MP's disapproval of London tube sign in Bengali,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/elon-musk-backs-british-mps-disapproval-of-london-tube-sign-in-bengali/articleshow/118126145.cms,"TOI CORRESPONDENT FROM LONDON: Elon Musk has backed a British MP’s disapproval of a sign at Whitechapel London Underground station being written in Bengali.Reform UK MP Rupert Lowe , who Musk frequently retweets, and whose party is opposed to immigration, tweeted a photo of Whitechapel station showing its sign in English and in Bengali script and wrote: “This is London — the station name should be in English, and English only.”Musk replied “Yes.”Abdal Ullah, a Tower Hamlets councillor and founder of the British Bangladeshi Power & Inspiration, spearheaded the Bengali script sign. He told TOI it came about during events to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Bangladesh as there is a large British Bangladeshi community in Whitechapel.“We did a number of events to celebrate the contribution of the Bangladesh community to Britain, like building the rag trade and the Brick Lane curry houses,” Ullah said. “During that time we initiated the lighting up of the London Eye in red and green, we organised a bike ride to promote climate change and British Bangladeshi artist Mohammed Ali created a mural in Brick Lane saying ‘Mateer Tan’ (Land is calling). At that time the Elizabeth line was about to open, so I initiated a plan to ask TfL to recognise the contribution of British Bangladeshis in the East End and to have the Whitechapel sign written in Bengali. Chinatown already had street signs in Chinese characters, even Brick Lane already had signs in Bengali. I did a campaign and TfL told me they thought it was a great idea to recognise our contributions and so we launched it,” he explained.When the sign was approved, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee did a tweet on it. “That was my claim to my fame and I was very honoured when she did that,” he said.“So, to be woken up and nowtold that Elon Musk is commenting on it, well he clearly has nothing better to do,” Ullah said. “ He seems to have too much time for everything related to Britain. Lowe is just pandering to the right-wing and trying to attract attention,” he added.Southall, known as Little Punjab, has had a sign in Gurmukhi script at its station saying “Southall” for many years. Even St Pancras International, the station for Eurostar, has signs in French.Ansar Ullah, director of the Swadhinata Trust, a Tower Hamlet-based Bengali community group, said the sign was meant to acknowledge the community rather than because they could not read English. “I suspect Lowe’s comments were purely political.But Hindi teacher Indu Barot said she was against the signage. “It makes Punjabis think Southall is their area and Bengalis think Whitechapel is their area. It is wonderful to see everyone promoting their languages. However, I sense a touch of politics in this, which seems to be dividing rather than uniting. We are living in Britain so the signs should just be in English,” she said.","Reform UK MP Rupert Lowe tweeted a photo of Whitechapel station showing its sign in English and in Bengali script. He wrote: “This is London — the station name should be in English, and English only”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118129069,imgsize-676555,width-400,resizemode-4/118129069.jpg"

As it aired: the Trump pregame interview on FOX

Poll What Do You Think Should Be the Key Focus in Resolving the Gaza Situation? Ensuring Fair Rights and Justice for All Involved Providing Better Housing and Support for Those Affected

US president Donald Trump remained relentless in his plan to take control of Gaza . Adding to the anguish of Palestinians who are already wary of his strategy, Trump announced on Monday that the Gazans would have no right to return to the territory after they has left.When asked by Fox News ' Bret Baier if the Palestinians would have the right to return, the US president said, ""No, they wouldn't, because they're going to have much better housing. In other words, I'm talking about building a permanent place for them.""In the Fox interview -- which will be broadcast on Monday after the first half was screened a day earlier -- Trump said he would build ""beautiful communities"" for the more than two million Palestinians who live in Gaza.""Could be five, six, could be two. But we'll build safe communities, a little bit away from where they are, where all of this danger is,"" added Trump.A day before, he reiterated his commitment to capture Gaza describing the war-torn enclave as a ""big real estate site.""He had first announced his plans to take over Gaza on Wednesday during a press conference with Israel 's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. ""The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it, too. We'll own it,"" he had said.Trump did not rule out sending US troops to secure Gaza. ""As far as Gaza is concerned, we’ll do what is necessary. If it’s necessary, we’ll do that,"" he said.He also suggested that Palestinians should move to other Middle Eastern countries, such as Egypt and Jordan, a proposal rejected by these nations.Following this, Netanyahu had praised Trump, calling him ""the greatest friend Israel has ever had.""The Palestinian leadership including President Mahmoud Abbas and Hamas both have said they won't let this happen and that Gaza was a part of Palestine .The criticism was not limited to the Arab world, with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Sunday labeling the plan ""a scandal,"" adding that the forced relocation of Palestinians would be ""unacceptable and against international law.""Trump's plan has also threatened to disrupt the fragile six-week ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and the chances of it progressing to a second, more permanent phase.Trump, however, repeated his insistence that he could persuade Egypt and Jordan, both major recipients of US military aid, to come around.""I think I could make a deal with Jordan. I think I could make a deal with Egypt. You know, we give them billions and billions of dollars a year,"" he told Fox.Since taking office for a second term, the President has continuously expressed his intentions to take control of foreign territories including Gaza and Greenland.","Trump said he would build ""beautiful communities"" for the more than two million Palestinians who live in Gaza.

Watch: First batch of illegal Venezuelan immigrants deported from US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-first-batch-of-illegal-venezuelan-immigrants-deported-from-us/articleshow/118132838.cms,"First batch of illegal Venezuelan immigrants deported from US (Picture credit: AP)

Past deportation attempts and US sanctions

Two flights carrying about 190 Venezuelans deported from the United States landed in Caracas late Monday, marking the first repatriation under a new agreement between Venezuela and the Trump administration.The arrivals follow a January 31 meeting between Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and Trump’s special envoy, Richard Grenell, in which Maduro agreed to accept deported migrants.As the first plane touched down, Maduro announced on national television, “The first plane has just arrived.” Shortly after, a second aircraft landed carrying additional deportees, according to AFP.The deportees included individuals suspected of having ties to the Tren de Aragua gang , a notorious Venezuelan criminal organization. Authorities have said that these individuals would be investigated further.Trump, who has promised the largest deportation campaign in US history, confirmed Venezuela's cooperation, writing on Truth Social that ""Venezuela has agreed to receive, back into their Country, all Venezuela illegal aliens who were encamped in the US, including gang members of Tren de Aragua.”He also said that Venezuela would fund the transportation of deportees. The White House later posted a photo of handcuffed and shackled individuals boarding a Conviasa plane, with the caption, “Repatriation flights to Venezuela have resumed… Make America Safe Again.The flights could mark a turning point in strained US-Venezuela relations, though it remains unclear what Maduro gained from the deal. His government issued a statement expressing hope for ""a new beginning of relations between the two countries, based on respect”.Despite this, Washington still does not recognise Maduro as Venezuela’s legitimate leader, maintaining that the 2024 election he claimed victory in was fraudulent.Human rights organisations have raised alarms over the deportations, arguing that many of those sent back could face persecution. Laura Dib, a Venezuela analyst at the Washington Office on Latin America, warned that returnees might ""face retaliations"" from Maduro’s regime, according to the New York Times.The US previously attempted deportation flights to Venezuela under the Biden administration in 2023, but Maduro withdrew permission after just a few months. Biden had initially relaxed sanctions on Venezuelan oil in exchange for political reforms but reimposed them when Maduro failed to meet democratic commitments.Meanwhile, Trump’s administration has maintained a strict stance against Venezuelan oil, stating, ""We don’t need Venezuelan oil.”It remains uncertain whether more deportation flights will follow, as neither Venezuela nor the US have commented on future plans.","Two flights carrying 190 Venezuelans deported from the United States landed in Caracas late Monday. The deportees included individuals suspected of having ties to the Tren de Aragua gang. The arrivals follow a January 31 meeting between Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and Trump’s special envoy, Richard Grenell.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118132840,imgsize-935795,width-400,resizemode-4/118132840.jpg"

Gujarat school principal caught on camera assaulting teacher,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/gujarat-school-principal-caught-on-camera-assaulting-teacher/articleshow/118132685.cms,"NEW DELHI: A school principal was caught on camera assaulting a teacher inside his office in Gujarat’s Bharuch district, prompting education authorities to launch an investigation.The incident occurred on 6 February at Navyug Vidyalaya, a grant-in-aid school run by a trust in Jambusar town. Following the incident, the school’s management has instructed principal Hitendra Thakor not to report for duty for the time being, Bharuch District Education Officer Swatiba Raol confirmed on Monday.CCTV footage released by the school shows principal Thakor seated inside his office, speaking with teacher Rajendrasinh Parmar and other colleagues. Suddenly, Thakor is seen rising from his chair, rushing towards Parmar, and repeatedly attacking him. He then drags Parmar to the floor and slaps him multiple times in the presence of others, who attempt to intervene.Raol stated that the school management had approached her on 7 February to submit a formal complaint regarding the principal’s conduct.“After receiving the complaint, I have formed a committee to investigate the incident. The committee will record the principal’s statement today (Monday). We will take appropriate action once the inquiry report is received. For now, the school management has instructed Thakor not to attend school,” said the education officer.While the exact cause of the altercation remains unclear, Thakor provided his justification for the incident when questioned by the media.“Many parents had lodged complaints against Parmar. Therefore, I called him for a meeting on 6 February. During that meeting, I attempted to explain things to him politely and questioned why his behaviour had not improved,” claimed Thakor.","A school principal was caught on camera assaulting a teacher inside his office in Gujarat’s Bharuch district.

US cyber agency created under Trump's first term removes election security staff working with states,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-cyber-agency-created-under-trumps-first-term-removes-election-security-staff-working-with-states/articleshow/118131363.cms,"Photo?AP

Several employees at the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) responsible for election security have been placed on administrative leave, news agency Associated Press reported. This move affects critical support for state and local election offices across the country.Seventeen CISA employees who worked with election officials on cybersecurity, ransomware threats, and physical security have been placed on leave pending a review, news agency AP reported, quoting a source familiar with the situation. Ten of them are regional election security specialists who were hired to strengthen election security efforts ahead of the 2024 election. The review will examine efforts to counter foreign interference in US elections, which have been assigned to other staff members.These employees, all former state or local election officials, were brought in to build relationships across all 50 states and more than 8,000 local election jurisdictions. They spent the past year working with officials, attending conferences, and providing guidance on cybersecurity and physical security measures.State election officials from both political parties have defended CISA’s role. Kentucky secretary of state Michael Adams, a Republican, said CISA’s local staff had been especially helpful for county clerks.""The most value that we've got from CISA has been the people that they have on the ground in our state that build direct relationships, not just with us but with the individual county clerks,"" Adams said. ""They're teaching them and helping them check their physical security and their cyber hygiene, and that's been extremely popular.""Michigan secretary of state Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, also supported CISA’s work.""And I hope that leaders in the federal government who claim to care about election integrity will recognize that,"" she was quoted as saying by news agency AP.The remaining employees placed on leave are current or former members of CISA’s election security and resilience team. The review is focused on the agency’s efforts to address misinformation and disinformation, as per the AP report. The ten regional election security specialists who worked with state and local officials were part of CISA’s field operations division.The personnel changes come amid criticism from some Republican officials. Kristi Noem, President Donald Trump’s new homeland security secretary, said during her Senate confirmation hearing that CISA had strayed ""far off mission"" and pledged to work with senators ""should you wish to rein them in.""Trump has not named a replacement for former CISA director Jen Easterly. CISA officials were also absent from recent meetings of state election officials in Washington, DC.CISA was established in 2018 during Trump’s presidency and is responsible for protecting critical infrastructure, including voting systems. Although it operates under the department of homeland security, it has its own Senate-confirmed director.Trump and his allies have criticized CISA’s efforts to counter misinformation related to the 2020 presidential election and the Covid-19 pandemic. CISA officials have said they did not engage in censorship but helped states notify social media platforms about misinformation without directing them to act.For the 2024 election, CISA and other federal agencies have warned about foreign misinformation campaigns, including three fake videos linked to Russia that falsely suggested election misconduct in key states.","Seventeen CISA employees who worked with election officials on cybersecurity, ransomware threats, and physical security have been placed on leave pending a review.

Kennedy ’s assassination following President Trump’s executive order to release the secret files.According to a report on Axios, the document contains 14,000 pages worth of material that disclosure board was supposed to review but never saw. However, the newly discovered documents remains secret at least for now.“This is huge. It shows the FBI is taking this seriously,” said Jefferson Morley, the vice president of the Mary Ferrell Foundation , which has the largest online record of JFK assassination records.“The FBI is finally saying, ‘Let’s respond to the president’s order,’ instead of keeping the secrecy going,” he added.Earlier in January, Trump had ordered the declassification of all remaining classified records related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, fulfilling a long-standing promise.The move was formalised through an executive order, which also called for the release of files concerning the assassinations of Senator Robert F. Kennedy and the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.“The families and the American people deserve transparency and truth,” the order said, adding that it is in the national interest to release these records without further delay.While the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 mandated full public disclosure of the files by October 2017, exemptions have allowed for the continued withholding of certain documents.Trump’s order claimed that continued redactions are “not consistent with the public interest.”""I have now determined that the continued redaction and withholding of information from records pertaining to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy is not consistent with the public interest and the release of these records is long overdue,"" it read.During his re-election campaign, Trump had pledged to release the remaining Kennedy assassination files, a promise he also made during his first term but later walked back, citing advice from intelligence officials.Former CIA Director Mike Pompeo was among those who urged Trump to keep certain files classified, citing potential national security concerns.Speculation around Kennedy’s assassination has persisted for decades. Kennedy was fatally shot in Dallas on November 22, 1963, and while Lee Harvey Oswald was identified as the lone gunman, conspiracy theories have long overshadowed the official narrative.","FBI has discovered around 2,400 new records related to President John F.

Bigger picture: US influence operations abroad

Did the US government actively work to destabilize Bangladesh using taxpayer-funded programs? Former US State Department official Mike Benz has made explosive claims that USAID and affiliated organizations orchestrated efforts to undermine the Bangladeshi government in a bid to secure American strategic interests.Speaking about US foreign policy planning, Benz laid out a hypothetical—but eerily specific—scenario: ""Let’s say it is vital to US national interest to build a military base in Bangladesh to counter China, but the Bangladeshi Prime Minister refuses. Our foreign policy planners then decide that regime change is necessary.""Benz explained that once such a decision is made, ""all options to destabilize the country"" come into play. These range from backing opposition forces to orchestrating a color revolution, a reference to past US-backed uprisings where leaders have been ousted, sometimes fleeing in helicopters.Benz also explained, according to leaked documents published by The Grayzone, US agencies, including the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), worked to ""destabilize Bangladesh’s politics""—a direct quote from the documents. The International Republican Institute (IRI), one of NED’s political branches, submitted a plan to the State Department in 2019-20, after previously failing to install the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) in power.The strategy involved recruiting-In one of the more striking revelations, Benz claimed that US taxpayer money was used to fund Bangladeshi rap groups to produce protest songs. The goal? Encourage street demonstrations disguised as ""peaceful protests""—which often spiral into riots.""One song was designed to sow resentment against the sitting government, another was meant to make people distrust their leaders,"" Benz explained. These songs were then strategically promoted among students who had already been protesting over local political issues, increasing tensions on the ground.The IRI’s baseline assessment identified the most effective ways to stir unrest. Benz noted that these methods often rely on fringe elements within society. “This is how we end up funding terrorists, paramilitaries, criminals, and even prostitutes in the name of soft power projection,” he said.While Benz did not weigh in on the morality of these actions, his claims paint a troubling picture of US foreign policy. If true, they expose how democracy promotion efforts may, in reality, serve as tools for regime change, shaping governments to align with US strategic goals.","Former US State Department official Mike Benz has made explosive claims that USAID and affiliated organizations orchestrated efforts to undermine the Bangladeshi government.

'Bring religion back'

WASHINGTON: Donald Trump said at his inauguration that he had been ""saved by God."" Now he appears to be returning the favor with an increasingly conservative, religious focus in his second term as US president.The three-times-married billionaire signed an executive order on Friday to open a ""Faith Office"" at the White House, led by the televangelist Paula White, Trump's so-called spiritual advisor.A day earlier Trump had unveiled a task force under new Attorney General Pam Bondi to root out what he called the ""persecution"" of Christians in the United States.The Republican has also appointed several cabinet members with links to Christian nationalists, including Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth.All of this comes despite the fact that Trump has long had an ambiguous relationship with religion.Unlike his predecessor Joe Biden, a devout Catholic, Trump rarely appears in Church. He was confirmed into the Presbyterian church but said he was ""non-denominational.""Then there are the sexual scandals -- and a criminal conviction for in a porn star hush money case -- and the selling of $60 Trump-branded Bibles on the campaign trail.Yet evangelical Christians continued to back him in the 2024 election, just as they did in 2016.During his first term Trump certainly dabbled with religion.He posed with a Bible outside a church near the White House after security forces cleared out ""Black Lives Matter"" protesters, and had prayer meetings in the Oval Office with evangelicals.But now Trump claimed to have had what amounts to a religious awakening.The 78-year-old said that he had become more religious since he narrowly escaped death when a gunman's bullet hit him in the ear at an election rally in Butler, Pennsylvania last year.""It changed something in me,"" Trump told a prayer breakfast at the US Capitol on Thursday.""I believed in God, but I feel much more strongly about it.""Not that this stopped Trump lashing out at the bishop who gave the sermon at his inauguration service, Mariann Budde, after she called on him to show ""mercy"" to immigrants and LGBTQ people.But the people Trump has chosen to surround himself with in the White House are also telling.A number have ties to the New Apostolic Reformation church -- a Christian nationalist movement that calls for the levers of government and society to come under Christian control.Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson has connections to people involved with the movement. So has Paula White, who will head up Trump's new Faith Office.White hit the headlines in 2020 when she led a marathon -- and widely mocked -- prayer session to call for Trump to win the US election against Joe Biden.Vance converted to Catholicism in his 30s and appeared at a town hall hosted by a leading figure in the New Apostolic Reformation Church.The White House published the executive order for the Faith Office on X on Friday, along with an image of Trump at the Resolute desk, surrounded by White and several other individuals, all apparently in prayer.The image was then published again on Saturday along with a quote from Trump saying: ""The Bible says 'Blessed are the peacemakers.'""Former Fox contributor and military veteran Hegseth, meanwhile, belongs to a church affiliated with the right-wing Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches (CREC), a Christian nationalist group.The movement wants to reestablish Biblical law, with some of its adherents calling for the repeal of women's right to vote, US media reported.While Trump has not expressed support for such views, he has increasingly adopted positions that have delighted America's religious right.He repeatedly boasted that the Supreme Court justices he picked in his first term helped lead to the 2022 overturning of the nationwide right to abortion.Since his inauguration he has sent a video message to a huge anti-abortion march attended by far-right groups and signed a series of executive orders tackling liberal causes, from diversity to transgender rights and abortion.His prayer breakfast speech at the US Capitol this week was unusually explicit in its call for an increased role for religion.""We have to bring religion back,"" said Trump. ""Let's bring God back into our lives.""","Donald Trump signs executive order to open a ""Faith Office"" at the White House. Trump has long had an ambiguous relationship with religion. He was confirmed into the Presbyterian church but said he was ""non-denominational"" Several of his cabinet members have links to Christian nationalists.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118130864,imgsize-919008,width-400,resizemode-4/118130864.jpg"

Third judge blocks Trump's order ending birthright citizenship for kids of people in US illegally,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/third-judge-blocks-trumps-order-ending-birthright-citizenship-for-kids-of-people-in-us-illegally/articleshow/118130538.cms,"CONCORD: A third federal judge on Monday blocked President Donald Trump's executive order ending birthright citizenship for the children of people who are in the US illegally.The ruling from US District Judge Joseph N. Laplante in New Hampshire comes after two similar rulings by judges in Seattle and Maryland last week.Laplante, who was nominated by Republican President George W. Bush, said he wasn't persuaded by the Trump administration's defense of the executive order. He said he would issue a longer preliminary injunction later explaining his reasoning.A lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union contends that Trump's order violates the Constitution and ""attempts to upend one of the most fundamental American constitutional values."" It was brought on behalf of immigrant rights groups with members who are pregnant and whose children could be affected by the order.Trump's Republican administration asserts that children of noncitizens are not ""subject to the jurisdiction"" of the United States and therefore are not entitled to citizenship.The administration is appealing the Seattle-based judge's block on Trump's executive order.At least nine lawsuits have been filed to challenge the birthright citizenship order.In the case filed by four states in Seattle, US District Judge John C Coughenour said last week Trump administration was attempting to ignore the Constitution.""The rule of law is, according to him, something to navigate around or something ignored, whether that be for political or personal gain,"" said Coughenour, who was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan. ""In this courtroom and under my watch the rule of law is a bright beacon, which I intend to follow.""A federal judge in Maryland also blocked Trump's order in another case brought by immigrants' rights groups and pregnant women whose soon-to-be-born children could be affected.The Trump administration has not yet filed an appeal of the preliminary injunction issued by US District Judge Deborah Boardman, who was appointed by Democratic President Joe Biden.A federal judge in Boston also heard arguments last week in a suit filed by a group of 18 states. US District Judge Leo Sorokin, who was appointed by Democratic President Barack Obama, did not immediately rule.Laplante, the judge in New Hampshire, praised both sides for the way they made their cases.""I'm not persuaded by the defendants' arguments on this motion,"" he said. ""I have to say: I'm not offended by them, either, as a lawyer or a jurist. I think the rule of law is best served, best maintained and preserved when excellent practitioners present their arguments to the court with all the experience, expertise and knowledge they can muster.""At the heart of the lawsuits in the three cases is the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1868 after the Civil War and the Dred Scott Supreme Court decision, which held that Scott, an enslaved man, wasn't a citizen despite having lived in a state where slavery was outlawed.In 1898, in a case known as United States v. Wong Kim Ark, the US Supreme Court found the only children who did not automatically receive US citizenship upon being born on US soil were children of diplomats, who have allegiance to another government; enemies present in the US during hostile occupation; those born on foreign ships; and those born to members of sovereign Native American tribes.The US is among about 30 countries where birthright citizenship - the principle of jus soli, or ""right of the soil"" - is applied.

Pakistani lawyers stage protest against high-level meeting of constitutional body to pick eight SC judges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-lawyers-stage-protest-against-high-level-meeting-of-constitutional-body-to-pick-eight-sc-judges/articleshow/118118105.cms,"Representative image (Image credits: ANI)

ISLAMABAD: Hundreds of lawyers on Monday staged protests in Pakistan's national capital against a high-level meeting of a constitutional body with the agenda to appoint at least eight judges of the supreme court. The judicial commission of Pakistan (JCP) meeting was being held despite opposition by four apex court judges, the legal fraternity, resistance by opposition the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf and controversy over the recent transfer of judges to the Islamabad high court (IHC), which was opposed by five IHC judges.The JCP, a top body empowered to approve judicial appointments, will finalise appointments for eight vacant supreme court judges.Lawyers gathered at various locations in Islamabad, with the lawyers' action committee staging a protest near D-Chowk. But police responded by closing several key entry points to the Red Zone, which houses key buildings, including the supreme court.Dozens of protestors gathered at Serena Chowk as they were stopped from going to the supreme court due to the closure of the Red Zone. They chanted ""Azaadi"" (freedom) and ""Lawyers' unity zindabad"" (long live lawyers' unity). They were also holding a banner written in Urdu and reading "" 26th constitutional amendment unacceptable"".Clashes were also reported between lawyers and police when they tried to enter the Red Zone. However, there was no report of any arrest or injury during the protest.The protest led to the suspension of metro bus services on multiple routes between Islamabad and Rawalpindi, causing significant inconvenience for commuters. The closure of the Red Zone has caused traffic disruptions, leading to heavy congestion on different roads in the capital.Earlier, the legal fraternity in the country was already expressing concerns against the new appointments and transfers following the controversial 26th constitutional amendment passed last year.The lawyers' representatives had held a convention at the Islamabad district courts, opposing the 26th amendment and demanding the cancellation of the JCP meeting.They also announced on February 3 to protest against the transfer of three high court judges to the IHC but it could not elicit a widespread response. The Karachi bar association had supported the strike call by staying away.Last month, the Lahore high court bar association (LHCBA) moved an application before the apex court through advocate Muhammad Waqar Rana, seeking postponement of the JCP meeting.The JCP earlier this month asked all high courts to send a list of five senior judges from each for consideration for the appointment of eight of them to the supreme court.Initially, the IHC had forwarded the names of three judges - chief justice Aamer Farooq, justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani and justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb - to the JCP because justices Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri and Babar Sattar did not meet the minimum requirement of five years of service.However, as justice Sarfraz Dogar was made the IHC senior puisne judge following his transfer there from the Lahore high court, his name has also been sent to the JCP.Days before justice Dogar's name was added, five judges of the IHC approached chief justice Yahya Afridi and IHC chief justice Aamer Farooq to reclaim their seniority.Separately, four SC judges, senior puisne judge justice Mansoor Ali Shah, justice Munib Akhtar, justice Ayesha Malik and justice Athar Minallah, in a letter to the chief justice showed concerns last week and are also seeking the postponement of today's JCP session until a decision is made on the petitions against the 26th Amendment.The opposition PTI party in a letter to the chief justice on Sunday asked to postpone the commission's meeting.The 13-member JCP is led by the chief justice and includes four judges of the apex court, as well as parliamentarians from both the treasury and opposition and others.The lawyers and opposition allege that the government was trying to 'pack' the top judiciary with hand-picked judges to influence the fate of political cases, a concern rejected by the government.","Hundreds of lawyers stage protests in Islamabad against high-level meeting of constitutional body.

Policemen at the checkpost offered stiff resistance in an encounter which lasted two hours, following which the terrorists fled,” the provincial police said in a statement.Pakistan has experienced an escalation in militancy in KP, adjacent to Afghanistan, following the collapse of a tenuous truce between TTP and the state in Nov 2022.Pakistani authorities have linked the surge in militant violence to cross-border incursions from Afghanistan, alleging that the Kabul administration is facilitating TTP fighters, a claim Afghan authorities refute. Most of these assaults have been directed at security and law-enforcement personnel, although civilians and govt officials have also been impacted.In KP’s Dera Ismail Khan district last week, four soldiers were killed by gunfire and an improvised explosive device (IED) unleashed by terrorists.In Balochistan, another restive province in Pakistan’s south, 18 soldiers were killed in an attack by terrorists earlier this month.Islamabad think-tank Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) has described 2024 as the most lethal year for security forces in a decade, with a minimum of 685 military and police fatalities resulting from 444 terror attacks.Alongside such attacks, militants have stepped up targeted killings and kidnappings of officials in KP and Balochistan.","Nearly a dozen militants stormed a police check post at Karak district in Pakistan’s restive northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province.

ISLAMABAD : The UN refugees and migration agencies on Wednesday expressed their concern over Pakistan 's decision to deport thousands of Afghan refugees awaiting relocation to the United States and elsewhere.The UN refugee agency, UNHCR , and the international organization for migration in a statement said they were seeking clarification from Pakistan, which said last week it would deport the refugees back to Afghanistan unless their cases were processed quickly by the countries that had agreed to take them in.About 20,000 Afghans were approved for resettlement in the US under a program that helps people at risk because of their work with the American government, media, aid agencies and rights groups. They were among tens of thousands of Afghans who fled to neighboring Pakistan after their country fell to the Taliban in 2021.However, they were left in limbo after President Donald Trump paused US refugee programs last month.""A UNHCR-issued non-return advisory has been in place since 2021, calling for a suspension of forced returns of Afghan nationals from any country regardless of their status,"" the joint UNHCR-IOM statement said.Pakistan's prime minister Shehbaz Sharif last week gave the green light to evict Afghans without papers from the cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi before March 31, in preparation for deportation if they were not relocated to their host countries.UNHCR and IOM said they are especially concerned for Afghan nationals who face a risk of harm upon return, such as ethnic and religious minorities, women and girls, journalists, human rights activists, and members of artistic professions like musicians and others.It said since January 1, 2025, an uptick in arrests of Afghan nationals in Islamabad and Rawalpindi has caused significant distress, with reports of Afghan nationals of various documentation statuses being rounded up.The Trump administration also announced the US refugee admissions program would be suspended from January 27 for at least three months. It has shocked Afghans who were hoping to travel to the United States soon.Afghans in Pakistan have been virtually living in hiding since 2023 when a crackdown began on foreigners who are in the country without proper documentation. An estimated 800,000 Afghans have either gone back voluntarily or been deported since despite criticism from UN agencies, rights groups and the Taliban.Besides thousands of Afghans who are living in Pakistan and awaiting travel to host countries, there are around 1.45 million Afghan nationals registered with UNHCR as refugees in Pakistan as well but their stay has been extended until June.In the statement, UNHCR and IOM urged ""Pakistan to implement any relocation measures with due consideration for human rights standards, including due process, and the legal status of proof of registration (POR) and afghan citizen card (ACC) holders, who have resided in Pakistan for an extended period of time"".""Pakistan has a proud tradition of hosting refugees, saving millions of lives.

ISLAMABAD: Afghan authorities have refused to receive the body of the son of a senior Afghan Taliban official who was killed, allegedly in a recent military offensive in Pakistan’s northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province bordering Afghanistan, state media claimed on Monday.Citing sources, Radio Pakistan referred to an intelligence-based operation conducted in KP’s Dera Ismail Khan district on Friday in which, the military claims, four terrorists were killed. “Among those killed was the son of the deputy governor (Maulvi Ghulam Muhammad Ahmadi, 55) of Baghdis province of Afghanistan. He was identified as Badaruddin, alias Yousaf,” it claimed, adding the Afghan authorities had refused to receive the body despite multiple requests from Pakistan.Radio Pakistan stated that US-made night vision equipment, along with M16A4 and M24 sniper rifles, were recovered from the terrorists who were killed.“Badaruddin was directly involved in the new wave of terrorist attacks from Afghanistan into Pakistan. The Afghan Taliban leadership still maintains close ties with terrorist organisations, including the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP),” the report said.

PESHAWAR: The Pakistani Taliban claimed the killing of a police officer as he travelled Monday to guard polio vaccinators on the first day of a nationwide immunisation effort after a year of rising cases.The officer was travelling to guard polio vaccinators in the area of Jamrud town in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province when he was killed, local police official Zarmat Khan told AFP.""Two motorcycle riders opened fire on him,"" he said. ""The constable died instantly at the scene."" Pakistan and neighbouring Afghanistan are the only countries where polio is endemic and militants have for decades targeted vaccination teams and their security escorts.The Pakistani Taliban in a statement claimed responsibility for the ""targeted attack"" and said militants also ""seized"" the slain officer's weapon.Pakistan reported at least 73 polio infections in 2024, compared to just six cases in 2023. The vaccination campaign which started on Monday is the first of the year and is due to last a week.""Despite the incident, the polio vaccination drive in the area remains ongoing,"" Khan said.Abdul Hameed Afridi, another senior police official in the area, also confirmed details of the attack and said officers have ""launched an investigation"".Prime minister Shehbaz Sharif acknowledged the violence in a statement from his office, saying ""the anti-polio campaign will continue with full vigour"".Polio can easily be prevented by the oral administration of a few drops of vaccine, but scores of vaccination workers and their escorts have been killed over the years.In the past, clerics falsely claimed that the vaccine contained pork or alcohol, declaring it forbidden for Muslims.In more recent years the attacks have focused on vulnerable police escorts accompanying the vaccinators as they go door-to-door.Last year, dozens of Pakistani policemen who accompany medical teams on campaigns went on strike after a string of militant attacks targeting them.Pakistan has witnessed rising militant attacks since the Taliban returned to power in neighbouring Afghanistan.More than 1,600 people were killed in 2024, the deadliest year in almost a decade, according to the center for research and security studies, an Islamabad-based analysis group.Islamabad accuses Kabul's new rulers of failing to rout militants organising on Afghan soil, a charge the Taliban government routinely denies.In November, at least seven people including five children were killed in a bombing targeting police gathered to guard vaccinators near a school in southwestern Balochistan province.Balochistan, which also neighbours Afghanistan, was the area with the largest number of polio cases in 2024, despite being the most sparsely populated.",The officer was travelling to guard polio vaccinators in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Pakistan: 18 soldiers killed in fighting with separatists,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-18-soldiers-killed-in-fighting-with-separatists/articleshow/117880229.cms,"Attacks on the rise

Rich in resources but poverty is rife

Pakistani troops fought insurgents who set up roadblocks in the restive northwestern region of Balochistan, leaving 18 paramilitaries and 23 rebels dead, officials said on Saturday. Three other Pakistani soldiers were seriously wounded in some of the heaviest clashes in recent years.The onslaught was claimed by the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), a militant organization behind rising violence in the Balochistan province that borders Afghanistan and Iran.A vehicle carrying unarmed border troops ""came under gunfire from 70 to 80 armed assailants who had blocked the road,"" a police official told the AFP news agency. The official was speaking on the condition of anonymity.The Pakistani military said the casualties occurred after troops engaged the insurgents who erected barricades on a key highway in Kalat, near the border with Afghanistan.The security forces ""successfully removed the roadblock"" following the overnight clashes, the military said in a statement.The military confirmed 18 soldiers died in the operation and vowed that ""the perpetrators, facilitators and abettors of this heinous and cowardly act, will be brought to justice."" Security forces recovered the bodies of 12 insurgents, the military said.Troops also killed another 11 insurgents in an operation that was still underway, the military added.Pakistan's Balochistan province is currently witnessing a surge in deadly attacks, fueled by demands for independence and control over local resources.A Sunni Muslim ethnic group who live on both sides of the Iran-Pakistan border, and also in parts of southern Afghanistan, over 10,000 Baloch have disappeared since 2011, according to Amnesty International.Efforts for autonomy or independence have been met with violent suppression on both sides of the border. In Pakistan, such efforts are viewed as attempts to fragment the nation — while in Iran the situation is further complicated by the Baloch being a Sunni Muslim minority in a predominantly Shiite country.The largest Baloch militant group, the BLA, is backed by the Pakistani Taliban, also known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).The TTP are a separate group from the BLA, with the TTP being allied with the Afghan Taliban.Balochistan is rich in natural resources such as gold, diamonds, silver, and copper — yet the local population remains among the poorest in Pakistan.","Pakistani troops fight insurgents who set up roadblocks in restive northwestern region of Balochistan. 18 paramilitaries and 23 rebels dead, three other Pakistani soldiers seriously wounded in some of the heaviest clashes in recent years.

Bilal Shabbir, Kalat’s deputy commissioner, said the attacks took place in Pidrang, Khazeni and Mangochar Bazaar areas of the town, where militants started conducting snap checks of passenger vehicles passing through town.In the first incident, Shabbir said a van carrying 17 soldiers from Panjgur to Quetta came under attack near the mountainous area of Khazeni, where armed men battled the security forces. He said one soldier of the Frontier Corps (FC), a paramilitary force, was separately killed in clashes with the militants.“The bodies of the slain soldiers were shifted to Quetta,” Shabbir said. “We don’t know how many attackers were killed because they took the bodies of their fighters into the mountains in the dark.”He said three FC personnel were also injured in the attack, adding that militants set a private bank on fire in Mangochar Bazaar.Separatist groups like BLA have long been at the forefront of a low-level insurgency in Balochistan, Pakistan's largest province by area and rich in mineral resources. Separatists claim that Islamabad is abusing the province’s natural wealth while ignoring the local population.In recent months, the BLA has become a major security threat, carrying out large-scale attacks in Balochistan and other parts of Pakistan, targeting Chinese nationals and interests engaged in investment projects, security forces, and ethnic Punjabis they perceive as outsiders in Balochistan.",At least 18 soldiers killed and five injured in Balochistan attacks.

Legal barriers to Monkey trade

Nepali Congress lawmaker Ram Hari Khatiwada proposed selling monkeys to China to tackle the nation’s growing agricultural destruction caused by the simians.He suggested this solution during a parliamentary discussion on urgent public issues raised by the minister for forest and environment.Citing Sri Lanka's sale of monkeys to China, Khatiwada said that Nepal should also use a similar strategy to deal with the simian-problem.""The monkey menace has induced nationwide terror. Sri Lanka sold its monkey to China, earn revenue, manage the monkeys and send the harmful animal as well. Nepal's monkey, after being declared harmful, has there been any arrangement for its sale to China or not? In the Hilly areas, the residents are struggling hard due to the menace,"" Khatiwada said.This will also serve as a strategy to control the monkey threat that ravages the hilly part of Nepal.Nepal is home to three monkey species: the Rhesus macaque (), the Assamese monkey (), and the Hanuman langur ().As a signatory to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), Nepal must adhere to regulations on trading threatened species. Since rhesus monkeys are listed under CITES, their international trade is restricted.According to the act to regulate and control international trade in endangered wild fauna and flora, a person who is found guilty faces a sentence of five to fifteen years in prison or fined NRs 5,00,000 to NRs 1 million or bothThe national park and wildlife conservation act also lists the rhesus monkey as a protected species, restricting its export without government approval. However, the act does not outline any measures for managing protected animals that pose threats to people and agricultural production.","Lawmaker Ram Hari Khatiwada proposed selling monkeys to China to tackle the nation’s growing agricultural destruction caused by the simians.
