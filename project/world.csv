'Very unfortunate that such an incident happened inside the Army campus': Manipur CM Biren Singh on missing Meitei man,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/very-unfortunate-that-such-an-incident-happened-inside-the-army-campus-manipur-cm-biren-singh-on-missing-meitei-man/articleshow/115847065.cms,"Manipur CM N Biren Singh

NEW DELHI: Manipur chief minister N Biren Singh on Saturday expressed deep concern over the disappearance of 56-year-old Meitei man Laishram Kamalbabu from the Leimakhong Army camp, calling the incident “very unfortunate.” He criticised the event occurring within the Army campus and assured that both the central and state governments are prioritising efforts to locate Kamalbabu.""The Central government has asked the concerned authority to find out the person's whereabouts and the state govt has also sent the team in search of the missing person. Our common agenda is to find the missing person and it is very unfortunate that such an incident happened inside the Army campus,"" he said.Kamalbabu, who had been supervising work for a contractor with the Military Engineering Services (MES) at the Leimakhong military station, went missing on November 25. He had left his home in Imphal West at 9 am for work, but failed to return later that afternoon. His family reported his disappearance after attempts to contact him failed. Kamalbabu’s younger brother filed a missing person's report, stating that Kamalbabu had been seen inside the Army campus, accompanied by a Nepali individual, before his phone was switched off.The Indian Army had launched an extensive search operation, which includes ground combing, drone surveillance, and aerial platforms in the military station and surrounding villages. The defence public relations office confirmed that the search was ramped up after they received the missing person report, which came on the evening of November 25. Despite these efforts, Kamalbabu’s whereabouts remain unknown.A joint action committee, formed by local residents, staged a sit-in protest in Imphal West on Wednesday, demanding that the Army ensure Kamalbabu’s safe return. The protesters insisted that the Indian Army be held accountable for the incident, calling for immediate action to locate the missing man.Chief minister Biren Singh said that the Army holds responsibility for tracing Kamalbabu, especially considering the gravity of the situation. He acknowledged the ongoing unrest caused by the incident, coming on the heels of another tragedy in Jiribam, where three women and three children were killed.

BJP flays Mehbooba for equating Bangla minorities with India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-flays-mehbooba-for-equating-bangla-minorities-with-india/articleshow/115873749.cms,"JAMMU

: J&K BJP leaders Sunday demanded action against PDP president Mehbooba Mufti for her remark comparing the condition of minorities in Bangladesh with those in India, calling it “anti-national.”Addressing party workers recently in Jammu, Mehbooba asked people to stand up to counter BJP’s alleged attempts at polarisation and asked if there was any difference between Bangladesh and India.Reacting to violence in Uttar Pradesh’s Sambhal, Mehbooba drew parallels between the row over survey of the mosque there and the atrocities being committed against Hindu minorities in Bangladesh.“Our Hindu brothers are facing oppression in Bangladesh. But what is the difference if we treat minorities here the same way? Ours is a great country, known worldwide for its secular character,” she said.Criticising Mehbooba’s statements, BJP leaders described them as “wrong and condemnable.”Former J&K BJP president Ravinder Raina told mediapersons that the J&K govt should take serious note of the “anti-national statement made by Mehbooba and her conspiracies.”BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh dismissed Mehbooba’s claim that the nation’s secular foundation is being shaken as “baseless,” saying it reflected her “ideological bankruptcy.”“Her comments are detached from reality,” he said, adding that she was engaged in divisive rhetoric, attributing it to her “frustration” over repeated electoral failures.",Mehbooba Mufti asked people to stand up to counter BJP’s alleged attempts at polarisation.

"Kuki-Zo youths shot multiple times, mostly on back in Manipur's Jiribram, reveals autopsy report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kuki-zo-youths-shot-multiple-times-mostly-on-back-in-manipurs-jiribram-reveals-autopsy-report/articleshow/115872930.cms,"Manipur violence

NEW DELHI: The 10 Kuki-Zo youths killed in an alleged confrontation with CRPF sustained multiple fatal bullet wounds, predominantly from behind, according to reports of post-mortem examination conducted at Silchar Medical College and Hospital (SMCH) in Assam. The PTI-accessed autopsy reports indicated no signs of torture apart from bullet injuries and their consequent effects.The youths, one of whom was a minor, were reportedly killed in a gunfight with security forces on November 11 near Borobekra police station in Manipur’s Jiribam district. Police claimed the deceased were militants who attacked the station and a nearby CRPF camp.The victims were identified as Ramneilien (29), Fimlien Kung Ngurte (31), Elvis Lalropei Zote (21), Lalthanei (22), Joseph Lalditum (19), Francis Lalzarlien (25), Roulneisang (30), Lalsiemlien Hmar (30), Henry Lalsanglien (25) and Robert Lalnuntluong (16). The post-mortem reports indicate most were wearing camouflage or khaki clothing. Six bodies arrived at SMCH on November 12, and four more, in early stages of decomposition, arrived on November 14. The reports estimate the time of death for the first group as 24-36 hours prior to examination, and 72-96 hours for the second group, except for Hmar, whose estimated time of death was 48-72 hours prior.Each body had multiple bullet entry and exit wounds. Some had over a dozen wounds. The reports, signed by teams of three doctors, noted bullets hit the victims all over their bodies, with most shots fired from behind. Four of the victime (Ngurte, Lalzarlien, Hmar, and Lalsanglien) were each missing an eye.The final cause of death remains pending, awaiting chemical analysis reports from the Directorate of Forensic Sciences in Guwahati.The Indigenous Tribal Leaders' Forum (ITLF), a Kuki-Zo organization, stated the funeral will be held in Churachandpur district on December 5. The ITLF had previously stated, ""The funeral of the Kuki-Zo youths would not be conducted till their post-mortem examination reports were handed over to the families.”The bodies were transported from Silchar to Churachandpur on November 16 and remain in the local morgue. The ITLF claims the deceased were village volunteers, while the Manipur government maintains they were militants. This incident occurs amidst ongoing ethnic violence between the Meitei and Kuki-Zo communities, which has resulted in over 250 deaths and thousands displaced since May. The conflict emerged following a 'Tribal Solidarity March' opposing Meitei community's ST status demands. Meiteis comprise 53 per cent of Manipur's population, residing mainly in the Imphal Valley, whilst tribals constitute over 40 per cent, inhabiting hill districts.","The 10 Kuki-Zo youths sustained multiple fatal bullet wounds, predominantly from behind.

Delhi is facing a complete law and order breakdown under BJP’s rule.""Delhi minister Saurabh Bharadwaj on Saturday alleged that the man wanted to set Kejriwal afire after throwing spirit on him during his Padyatra campaign. In a post on X, Bharadwaj also alleged that the attacker was connected with the BJP.This latest incident follows a similar attack in October, when AAP claimed that Kejriwal was targeted during a rally in Delhi. The party accused the BJP of orchestrating the attack by mobilizing its supporters to disrupt the event.Delhi BJP President Virendraa Sachdeva said that the incident was a 'political drama' orchestrated by Kejriwal ahead of Delhi elections. Sachdeva told ANI, ""I have been saying since day 1 that Arvind Kejriwal will get himself slapped and get things thrown at him. As per the information, it was just water and the person is their local worker. He has been caught in an intoxicated state. This is a political drama. This is disappointment and hopelessness. Nothing is working now so they are making such cliche moves.""Responding to the incident, BJP MP Kamaljeet Sehrawat said, ""Whenever a leader goes for a Padyatra, he comes in a very close proximity with the people. Hence, such incidents happen even after strong security. But it is the mistake of that person. He should have asked his question instead of doing this. The people are enraged because the streets are broken, drains are overflowing and the pollution level is high.""This attack is not the first of its kind that Kejriwal has faced. Back in 2016, the AAP leader was targeted with ink during a visit to Bikaner, Rajasthan, where he had attended a condolence meeting for a local AAP leader.Since his political debut in 2013, Kejriwal has faced several similar attacks.With just months left before the Delhi Assembly elections, AAP has ramped up its efforts to engage voters and strengthen its grassroots support. Kejriwal, along with senior party leaders, is actively participating in padyatras across the city, reaching out to constituents and discussing the party's agenda. These foot marches are part of the second phase of a broader strategy designed to bolster AAP's presence ahead of the polls.Kejriwal, while campaigning on Friday, announced that registration for the Rs 1,000 monthly honorarium for women under the ‘ Mukhyamantri Mahila Samman Yojana ’ will begin soon. He also accused the BJP of failing to provide essential services like uninterrupted electricity, quality healthcare, and good schools, despite governing in 22 states across the country.","Ashok Jha, serving bus marshal at Delhi Transport Corporation's Khanpur Depot, has been detained.

Trump signals pardon for January 6 rioters



US President-elect Donald Trump has slammed outgoing President Joe Biden's decision to pardon his son, Hunter Biden, calling it a "" miscarriage of justice ."" The pardon, issued on Sunday, absolves Hunter Biden of convictions related to gun crimes and tax violations.In a post on Truth Social, Trump questioned whether the pardon extended to individuals imprisoned for their roles in the Capitol Hill riots took place on January 6, 2021, whom he referred to as “J-6 Hostages.” Trump and his supporters have consistently portrayed these individuals as patriots, unjustly imprisoned for their actions.“Does the Pardon given by Joe to Hunter include the J-6 Hostages, who have now been imprisoned for years? Such an abuse and miscarriage of Justice!” Trump wrote, hinting at potential pardons for the January 6 rioters once he assumes office.President Biden defended the decision to pardon his son, framing the legal actions against Hunter as politically motivated. In a statement, Biden argued that individuals in similar circumstances—such as those with tax issues tied to addiction—typically receive non-criminal resolutions.“From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department's decision-making, and I kept my word even as I watched my son being selectively and unfairly prosecuted,” Biden said.""Without aggravating factors like use in a crime, multiple purchases, or buying a weapon as a straw purchaser, people are almost never brought to trial on felony charges solely for how they filled out a gun form,"" the US President added.Biden condemned the collapse of a plea deal that had been negotiated with the Department of Justice, associating it to political pressure from his opponents in Congress.The President said that the charges were instigated to attack him politically, not on the merits of the case.“The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election. Had the plea deal held, it would have been a fair, reasonable resolution of Hunter's cases,” Biden said.Trump’s reaction also renewed speculation that he would issue pardons for individuals imprisoned over the Capitol Hill riots. Trump has long been mentioning the that these individuals acted patriotically, echoing his supporters' claims that they have been treated unfairly by the justice system.","US President-elect Donald Trump has slammed outgoing President Joe Biden's decision to pardon his son, Hunter Biden.

Tax violations



US President Joe Biden has granted his son, Hunter Biden, a full and unconditional pardon, reversing his earlier stance of not intervening in his son’s legal matters. The pardon, announced on Sunday, covers federal gun and tax charges Hunter Biden faced for offences committed between January 1, 2014, and December 1, 2024, including all offences charged or prosecuted (including any that have resulted in convictions) by Special Counsel David Weiss.In June, Hunter Biden was convicted in Delaware on three felony counts related to his purchase of a firearm in 2018. He had falsely claimed on his gun-purchase form that he was not using illicit drugs at the time. The charges stemmed from a lengthy investigation into Hunter’s actions, which were tied to his personal struggles with addiction. Despite these circumstances, the case was pursued in federal court, resulting in a conviction.President Biden defended his son’s actions, claiming that such cases are typically resolved without criminal penalties, especially when drug addiction is involved. Hunter Biden, who Joe Biden claimed has been sober for over five years, faced these charges while in recovery.In September, Hunter Biden pleaded guilty to nine tax offences, related to over $1.4 million in unpaid taxes from income he spent on lavish expenses, including escorts, drugs, and cars. The charges were filed after a lengthy investigation started in 2018. Hunter’s legal team argued that he was unfairly targeted by Republicans, with some suggesting the case was politically motivated to damage Joe Biden’s presidential campaign. The pardon granted by Joe Biden eliminates any possibility of Hunter facing prison time for these tax violations.President Biden’s decision to pardon his son and use of executive authority has been met with mixed reactions, but he maintained that Hunter was subjected to unfair prosecution. “Hunter was treated differently,” the president said, pointing to political motives behind the charges.","US President Joe Biden has granted his son, Hunter Biden, a full and unconditional pardon.

"In U-turn, US president Joe Biden pardons son Hunter Biden in gun, tax fraud charges",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/i-hope-americans-will-understand-in-u-turn-us-president-joe-biden-pardons-son-hunter-in-gun-tax-fraud-charges/articleshow/115881097.cms,"US President Joe Biden pardoned his son, Hunter Biden, for gun and tax fraud charges. The pardon covers federal crimes Hunter Biden may have committed between January 1, 2014, and December 1, 2024. Hunter Biden faced sentencing in December for tax and gun convictions. The decision comes as a U-turn as Biden had repeatedly said he would not use his presidential authority to pardon his son, as reported by CNN.The pardon prevents Hunter Biden from being sentenced or imprisoned for crimes. The scheduled court hearings will likely be canceled. The pardon also covers the period when Hunter Biden served on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma, a position that drew scrutiny over foreign business dealings.“Today, I signed a pardon for my son Hunter,” the president said. The White House confirmed it is a “full and unconditional pardon.” This action reverses Biden’s previous statements that he would not pardon his son.Hunter Biden was found guilty in June of illegally purchasing and possessing a firearm, with the trial focusing on his struggles with drug addiction and family issues. In September, he admitted to nine tax violations for failing to pay taxes on $1.4 million in income, which he spent on things like escorts, strippers, cars, and drugs. Hunter's lawyers argued that he was being unfairly targeted by Trump and other Republican lawmakers. Hunter's lawyers had claimed that he was being targeted by Trump and other congressional Republicans.The two charges stemmed from a probe started in 2018 by then-US Attorney David Weiss who filed indictments in 2023.President Biden said he pardoned Hunter Biden because he believes his son was unfairly prosecuted. “Hunter was treated differently” from others who commit similar crimes, the president said. He also asserted that political opponents used the charges to attack him. “I hope Americans will understand why a father and a president would come to this decision,” he said.""I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department's decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted,"" President Biden said in Sunday's statement.""The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election,"" he added.""I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice.""The pardon comes as criminal cases against President-elect Trump have come to a standstill after a sweeping ruling on presidential immunity by the Supreme Court -- all but ensuring Biden's Republican rival will likely never see a jail cell, even after his landmark conviction for falsifying business records in May.A White House official said president Biden felt his son was targeted to hurt him politically. “He feels Hunter was targeted in order for his political opponents to hurt him and that was cruel and he endured enough,” the official explained. President Biden spent Thanksgiving with his family, including Hunter, before announcing the pardon.One factor that influenced the president’s decision was his belief that his political opponents were trying to ""break Hunter,"" especially while he was recovering from addiction. The president highlighted his son's five and a half years of sobriety, despite facing constant attacks and unfair treatment.He said he struggled with the decision but made up his mind over the weekend.“No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter’s cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son – and that is wrong,” Biden said.Meanwhile, president-elect Donald Trump has condemned outgoing President Joe Biden's decision to pardon his son, Hunter Biden, calling it a “miscarriage of justice.”“Does the Pardon given by Joe to Hunter include the J-6 Hostages, who have now been imprisoned for years?

'Our brand is toxic': Former US Democratic lawmaker calls for 'complete reset' of party after Harris loss to Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/our-brand-is-toxic-former-us-democratic-lawmaker-calls-for-complete-reset-of-party-after-harris-loss-to-trump/articleshow/115879612.cms,"Former US Democratic lawmaker Tim Ryan urged the party to “rebrand” on Saturday, calling the party’s image “toxic” in many areas. Speaking on MSNBC's ""The Weekend,"" Ryan argued the party needs a major overhaul after President-elect Donald Trump 's victory over vice president Kamala Harris “You start with a complete reset. We need a rebrand. I think you and I have been talking about this since 2016, like, our brand is toxic in so many places and it is like, you are a Democrat? That’s the stuff we get like in Ohio. So it needs — we need a complete reboot. We need a complete reboot with the DNC . We need a complete rebranding ,” Ryan said, as reported by Fox News. He believed the party hadn’t offered enough to voters in the political middle ground who were reluctant to vote for Trump.Ryan suggested the Democrats should focus on policies that resonate with working-class voters , like reindustrialization and American competitiveness. He questioned the party’s stance against the crypto industry and called for a return to “bread and butter policies.” He contrasted his view with a focus solely on redistribution.Ryan cited former President Bill Clinton’s campaign as a model for the party moving forward, saying, “The other thing that I think is really big, we can’t be for solely redistribution. It is about getting back to you want — it is the Bill Clinton campaign. It is the modern Democratic campaign. Look at the touchstone.

Senator Bernie Sanders believes the party’s losses stem from abandoning the working class. However, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi disagreed with Sanders’ assessment. “With all due respect, and I have a great deal of respect for him [Sanders], for what he stands for, but I don't respect him saying that the Democratic Party has abandoned the working class families.

From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department’s decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted. Without aggravating factors like use in a crime, multiple purchases, or buying a weapon as a straw purchaser, people are almost never brought to trial on felony charges solely for how they filled out a gun form. Those who were late paying their taxes because of serious addictions, but paid them back subsequently with interest and penalties, are typically given non-criminal resolutions. It is clear that Hunter was treated differently.""""The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election. Then, a carefully negotiated plea deal, agreed to by the Department of Justice, unraveled in the court room – with a number of my political opponents in Congress taking credit for bringing political pressure on the process. Had the plea deal held, it would have been a fair, reasonable resolution of Hunter’s cases,"" he added.He also stated that there has been an effort to break Hunter – who has been five and a half years sober, even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution. In trying to break Hunter, they’ve tried to break Biden – and there’s no reason to believe it will stop here.""For my entire career I have followed a simple principle: just tell the American people the truth. They’ll be fair-minded. Here’s the truth: I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice – and once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further.

Who is Massad Boulos?



What is Boulos role in Trump campaign?



Who are there in his family members?



US President-elect Donald Trump appointed his daughter Tiffany Trump 's father-in-law and a Lebanese-born billionaire Massad Boulos as senior adviser for Arab and Middle Eastern affairs .Trump announced via Truth Social, commending Boulos's legal expertise and his dedication to Middle Eastern peace initiatives.""I am proud to announce that Massad Boulos will serve as Senior Advisor to the President on Arab and Middle Eastern affairs. Massad is an accomplished lawyer and a highly respected leader in the business world, with extensive experience on the International scene,"" Trump wrote. ""Massad is a dealmaker, and an unwavering supporter of PEACE in the Middle East. He will be a strong advocate for the United States, and its interests.""This is for the second time, a family member has been assigned with a role in Trump's new cabinet. Earlier, Trump offered a position in his administration to Charles Kushner, his daughter Ivanka’s father-in-law, to serve as ambassador to France.Trump has long turned to his family members to serve in political roles, raising questions about conflicts of interest and nepotism.Born in Lebanon, Boulos relocated to Texas during his teenage years to study at the University of Houston. His professional journey began in Nigeria, where he advanced to leadership positions at SCOA Motors and Boulos Enterprises, Newsweek reported.Reports about Boulos's political involvement in Lebanon have been contested. While some sources suggested he contested a parliamentary seat in 2009 and maintained connections with Lebanon's Christian political establishment, Boulos clarified to Newsweek that he holds no party affiliations, though he acknowledges acquaintance with Christian leaders.During a June interview with AP, Boulos acknowledged his friendship with Suleiman Frangieh, who leads the Marada Movement and received Hezbollah's endorsement for the Lebanese presidency. Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah, who supported Frangieh's candidacy in 2023, was killed in an Israeli airstrike on Beirut in September.Before the election last month, Boulos played a major unofficial role in the Trump campaign, courting Arab American voters who Republican strategists hoped would support Trump out of frustration with President Biden’s support for Israel. Despite Trump’s own defiantly pro-Israel policies during his first term as president, Boulos worked to build support for him in heavily Arab American and Muslim corners of Michigan, New York Times reported.Although there are very less information about his private space, but his connection with Donald Trump is surely on every internet posts. Boulos' son Michael is married to Tiffany Trump in 2022. Boulos has recently focused on garnering Arab American support for Trump's campaign, particularly in Michigan. Sources indicate he has also facilitated communications between Trump and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.","Lebanese-born billionaire Massad Boulos appointed as senior adviser for Arab and Middle Eastern affairs.

But if you’re willing to lie, you actually do. That’s the broken system we have today,"" Ramaswamy explained.Ramaswamy linked these flaws to broader frustrations within the conservative movement, citing the need for reform both in legal and illegal immigration processes. He underscored the importance of first securing the border to address the ongoing illegal immigration crisis before tackling broader legal reforms.A staunch supporter of Donald Trump , Ramaswamy echoed Trump’s policies, stating that immigration reform must start with enforcing the rule of law.In earlier comments, Ramaswamy labelled mass deportations and the cessation of federal funding for undocumented immigrants as ""pragmatic"" measures, suggesting such actions would prompt "" self-deportations "" while addressing the crisis.Ramaswamy’s remarks reflect his broader vision for immigration, which he claims aligns with American meritocracy and constitutional principles.As the son of legal immigrants, he has consistently emphasised his belief in the importance of entering the US lawfully and his opposition to policies that reward those who don’t.","Vivek Ramaswamy has again shared his remarks on the US immigration system being broken.

: US President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday demanded a ""commitment"" from Brics nations, which includes China, India, and Russia , that they will not seek to create a new currency or back any other currency to replace the ""mighty"" US dollar , failing which he warned they would face 100 per cent tariffs and be denied access to the ""wonderful"" US economy.The provocation for Trump's sudden tirade was not immediately clear, but several skeptics of the long-term viability of the US economy based on the dollar's dominance have discreetly begun exploring other currencies and methods for global trade. The move is driven by Russia, which is suffering from crippling US sanctions, and China, which hopes to displace the US as the pre-eminent power in the world.The expanded Brics alliance includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran & United Arab Emirates. Turkey, Azerbaijan and Malaysia have applied to become members and several other countries have expressed interest in joining the grouping which now accounts for 35 per cent of the global economy based on purchasing power parity, overtaking the 30 per cent share of the G7 developed nations in recent months.In an abrupt social media post without preamble, Trump appeared to fire a warning shot against the group's recent deliberations on ""de-dollarisation,"" saying, ""the idea that the Brics Countries are trying to move away from the Dollar while we stand by and watch is OVER.""""They can go find another “sucker!” There is no chance that the Brics will replace the US Dollar in International Trade, and any Country that tries should wave goodbye to America,"" Trump said, adding that the US requires ""a commitment from these Countries that they will neither create a new Brics Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty US Dollar or, they will face 100% Tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful US Economy.""The dollar’s unique status and primacy rests on the perception of America being a stable, reliable bedrock of global politics and business, something that is being called into question in recent years in the face of mounting US debts and deficits, and political uncertainty and gridlock. Despite challenges, the dollar continues to reign supreme, accounting for more than 58.36% of official foreign exchange reserves across the world because of its scale and liquidity, and the perception of US as a stable society with a mature economy. The euro is currently the second most commonly held reserve currency, representing about 20% of international foreign currency reserves.Most US experts see no immediate threat to the dollar. The last time the world switched its reserve currency from the British pound to the American dollar some 80 years ago, the transition was relatively seamless because the US and UK were allies, but even with the adversarial relationship Washington faces with Beijing and Moscow, they reckon the dollar is safe although Trump's sudden ferment suggests he sees some discomfort as he comes into office for a second term.","US President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday demanded a ""commitment"" from Brics nations that they will not seek to create a new currency or back any other currency to replace the ""mighty"" US dollar.

Pak sectarian violence: Death toll rises to 130 as clashes continue in Kurram despite ceasefire,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pak-sectarian-violence-death-toll-rises-to-130-as-clashes-continue-in-kurram-despite-ceasefire/articleshow/115868783.cms,"PTI photo

PESHAWAR: The death toll from sectarian violence in Pakistan's restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province surged to 130, with at least six people killed and eight injured on Sunday, as clashes in the volatile Kurram district continued for the eleventh consecutive day.The clashes between Alizai and Bagan tribes in the district started on November 22, after an attack on a convoy of passenger vans near Parachinar in which 47 people were killed a day earlier. Several passengers who had sustained grave injuries succumbed later, raising the toll in the convoy killing to 57.Police said the situation remained tense, and violence persists despite a recent ceasefire agreement between the Sunni and Shia groups.The six new deaths reported on Sunday brought the death toll to 130, while the total number of injured rose to 186 after eight fresh injuries were reported.The 10-day truce brokered last week has been rendered ineffective by intermittent violence, which shows no signs of abating.A high-powered delegation, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Secretary Nadeem Aslam Chaudhry and IGP Akhtar Hayat Gandapur, had also negotiated a ceasefire last weekend, but violence resumed shortly afterwards.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi earlier planned to dispatch members of the grandpeace jirga (council of tribal leaders) from Kohat division to Kurram for engaging with leaders from both warring factions to negotiate peace.Addressing a gathering of political leaders and tribal elders in Kohat on Sunday, he called for strict action with public cooperation to make the region weapon-free through joint operations.He said he was ready to go to Kurram and stay there for as many days as the jirga suggested to ensure peace in the region.""No other country or province will resolve our issues. We must take responsibility for improving the situation ourselves,"" he said.Kundi announced an All-Parties Conference (APC) for peace and the province's rights and invited Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur to join it.The governor stressed the role of religious scholars in promoting peace, urging them to focus on unity.Several other leaders addressed the gathering, putting aside their ideological differences on other issues.The continued violence forced the closure of the main Peshawar-Parachinar Road for travel, and commuting at the Pak-Afghan Kharlachi border has also been suspended.The closure of the main arteries has created a scarcity of oil, food commodities and medicines in the region.The Kurram region is also experiencing a communication blackout, with mobile and internet services suspended and educational institutions closed.Police and other security forces personnel had been deployed in various parts of Lower Kurram, said Deputy Commissioner Javed Ullah Mehsud, adding that all-out efforts will be made for a truce in other areas today as well.""We are hopeful for progress on a ceasefire and reopening of transport routes,"" he stated.Previous efforts to mediate peace, including a seven-day truce brokered by provincial officials in November have failed to hold.","Death toll from sectarian violence in Pakistan's restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province surges to 130.

Additionally, five of Dr. Zafar's guests were abducted from his house. While Dr. Zafar was later released after severe humiliation and torture, the others remain forcibly disappeared.""The BYC expressed its grave concern, emphasizing that despite their peaceful efforts, the genocide they are resisting is rapidly intensifying.Vowing to continue its resistance movement, the BYC stated, ""We can never, and will never, remain indifferent while our people endure such brutality.

The Awami League claims that the primary target was Sheikh Hasina , who was the leader of the opposition at the time, under the BNP-Jamaat alliance govt.The attack claimed the lives of at least 24 people, including Awami League's women's affairs secretary Ivy Rahman, who was also the wife of late President Zillur Rahman. Over 300 others were injured, and Hasina, though surviving the attack, suffered permanent hearing impairment.The high court also annulled a lower court's verdict, which had convicted 49 individuals in connection with the attack. The court declared the trial court's 2018 decision illegal, noting it had been delivered in an improper manner.The lower court's conviction had relied on the confessional statement of Mufti Abdul Hannan, an accused who was later executed in a separate matter. The HC ruled that his testimony lacked evidential value, as it had been obtained under duress and wasn't properly examined by the magistrate.BNP hailed the move and accused Awami League of using state power to unjustly convict Rahman and other leaders.","Bangladesh high court on Sunday acquitted all the accused in the Aug 21, 2004, grenade attack cases.

Bangladesh's immigration authorities at the Benapole border crossing turned away 54 members of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (Iskcon) on Sunday, despite them possessing valid passports and visas.The immigration police cited a lack of specific government approval for their travel as the reason for barring their entry. ""We consulted the special branch of police and received instructions from the higher authorities not to permit them (to cross the border),"" officer-in-charge of Benapole immigration police , Imtiaz Ahsanul Quader Bhuiyan was quoted as saying by The Daily Star newspaper.He added that while the devotees carried valid passports and visas, they were ""lacking specific government permission.""The group of 54 members, including devotees from various districts in Bangladesh, had arrived at the check post between Saturday night and Sunday morning. They waited for hours, hoping for permission to proceed, only to be informed their travel was not authorized.""We came to participate in a religious ceremony taking place in India, but immigration officials stopped us, citing the absence of government permission,"" said Iskcon member Saurabh Tapandar Cheli.This incident comes amid heightened scrutiny of Iskcon in Bangladesh following the arrest of Hindu leader Chinmoy Krishna Das on November 27. Das, a spokesperson for the Bangladesh Sammilita Sanatani Jagran Jote, was detained at Dhaka's Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on charges of sedition. The case alleges that he and others hoisted a saffron flag above the Bangladeshi national flag during a rally on October 25 in Chattogram.Das's arrest sparked protests among his supporters, leading to violent clashes that resulted in the death of a lawyer in Chattogram.Bangladeshi authorities froze the bank accounts of 17 individuals associated with Iskcon, including Das, for a 30-day period.Adding to the tension, two Iskcon monks, Adi Purush Shyam Das and Ranganath Das, were arrested on Friday while returning from delivering prasad to Das in prison. Both monks, natives of Chattogram, were detained amid heightened concerns over violence targeting Hindu minorities since the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government in August.The Bangladesh high court, however, declined to issue a suo motu order to ban Iskcon in the country.",Bangladesh's immigration authorities turn away 54 members of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness.
