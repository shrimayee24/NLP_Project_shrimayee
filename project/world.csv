New footage captures Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar throwing stick at drone before being killed by Israel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/new-footage-captures-hamas-chief-yahya-sinwar-throwing-stick-at-drone-before-being-killed-by-israel/articleshow/114344358.cms,"Yahya Sinwar's Video Fighting Israeli Military Before His Death Out | Last Moments On IDF Cam

Footage released by the Israeli Defence Forces reveals Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar making a last-ditch attempt to save his life just moments before he was killed. In the footage, Sinwar who was one of the key faces behind the October 7 attack, could be seen throwing a stick at an Israeli drone moments before he was killed in southern Gaza . The video showed Sinwar slumped in a chair, covered in dust, as the drone hovered nearby.The video emerged following a year-long manhunt that concluded with a gun battle on Wednesday.Israeli forces initially did not realise they had located Sinwar. As Israeli military officials detailed, the operation that led to his demise was not a planned airstrike, but rather an engagement by infantry soldiers from the Bislach Brigade, who were operating in the Tal El Sultan area, where they believed senior Hamas members were present.During the encounter, the troops engaged three suspected militants, prompting a firefight that forced Sinwar into a derelict building. Israeli forces subsequently targeted the structure with tank shells and a missile. In the aftermath, the drone footage revealed Sinwar, wounded and dishevelled, as he futilely attempted to knock down the drone with a stick. Initial identification of Sinwar as a combatant was confirmed later through dental records and DNA testing.Hamas has yet to officially respond to Sinwar's death, but sources within the group have acknowledged its likelihood. The Israeli military highlighted that extensive operations conducted over the past year had severely limited Sinwar’s movement, forcing him into increasingly desperate measures. In his final days, he reportedly ceased using telephones, believing this would aid in evading Israeli intelligence.Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi, head of Israel's military, noted that Sinwar's actions reflected a fugitive's lifestyle, as he changed locations frequently. While there were concerns he might use hostages as human shields, no captives were found in the vicinity during the operation.","Yahya Sinwar was one of the key faces behind the October 7 attack.

Jammu and Kashmir Ghaznavi Force duo behind several grenade attacks arrested in J&K’s Poonch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jammu-and-kashmir-ghaznavi-force-duo-behind-several-grenade-attacks-arrested-in-jks-poonch/articleshow/114381746.cms,"JAMMU: J&K Police on Saturday claimed to have busted a module of the proscribed Jammu and Kashmir Ghaznavi Force (JKGF) — a shadow outfit of Jaish-e-Mohammad — in Poonch district and solved several past grenade attacks with the arrest of two JKGF terrorists.At a press conference, ADGP (Jammu Zone) Anand Jain termed the twin arrest a “very big achievement” for security agencies.He said the JKGF duo was “part of a larger conspiracy and tried to spread terror in Poonch” by carrying out grenade attacks at several places — including a temple, a gurdwara, an Army camp and a hospital — to disturb peace and communal harmony in the region.The first arrest came Friday afternoon in Poonch’s Surankote when a joint team of security forces apprehended Abdul Aziz , a resident of Hari village, Surankote, with two grenades at a checkpoint in Dundak area. After interrogation, police recovered another grenade from Abdul’s residence and later that evening, arrested his aide Manwar Hussain , also from Hari village, with a pistol, a magazine and 10 rounds.With the arrest of these two terrorists — who had links across the border — all five cases of grenade attacks that took place since Nov 2023 have been solved, the ADGP said Saturday. Abdul was involved in lobbing grenades at a Shiva temple in Surankote on Nov 15, 2023; Gurdwara Mahant Sahib in Poonch on March 26, 2024; an Army sentry post in Poonch’s Kamsar in June 2024 and a school ground near a CRPF sentry post on Aug 14, 2024. Hussain, meanwhile, had thrown a grenade near the district hospital quarters on July 18, 2024, police said.Questioning of the terrorists has so far revealed that they had received four consignments of arms, ammunition and Rs 1.5 lakh cash from their cross-border handlers, the ADGP stated, adding that the duo was trained in handling pistols and had fired a few rounds in forested areas for practice. The duo also pasted anti-national posters at different locations in Surankote, including govt high schools in Hari, Dhundak, Sanai, Eidgah-Hari and other adjoining areas. These posters were printed at Hussain's house and pasted in Aug last year on the directions of their handler to create fear among the public, police said.Last month, another member of this module, Mohd Shabir, a resident of Daryala, was arrested on Sept 12 with a large quantity of explosives. Abdul had supplied the explosives to him, police said.“This operation marks a crucial step in dismantling terror networks, as both individuals were involved in orchestrating terror activities, including grenade attacks on religious sites and hospitals, terror financing, anti-national propaganda, and arms smuggling,” Defence PRO Lt Col Suneel Bartwal said, adding: “This success follows last month’s arrest of another associate, underscoring the relentless efforts of the Indian Army and security forces to ensure peace and stability in the region.”",J&K Police on Saturday claimed to have busted a module of the proscribed Jammu and Kashmir Ghaznavi Force (JKGF) The JKGF is a shadow outfit of Jaish-e- Mohammad.

We express concern over all threats to UNIFIL's security,"" read a final statement from the ministers, while calling for Iran to stop supporting Hamas and Hezbollah.Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met a Hamas representative in Istanbul on Saturday, according to the IRNA official news agency.The many, concurrent conflicts -- including instability in sub-Saharan Africa and growing tensions in the Asia-Pacific region -- ""highlight a deteriorated security framework with forecasts for the near future that cannot be positive"", said Italian Defence Minister Giudo Crosetto at the start of the one-day talks.The summit came two days after Israel announced it had killed Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar, mastermind of the October 7, 2023 attacks on Israel that triggered the devastating retaliatory war in Gaza.Also in attendance were Nato chief Mark Rutte and the EU's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, who echoed the words of US President Joe Biden that the death of Sinwar could mark an opportunity to bring about the end of hostilities.""Certainly after the killing of Yahya Sinwar, a new perspective is open and we have to use it in order to reach a ceasefire, to release the remaining hostages and to look for a political perspective,"" Borrell told journalists.The morning session included discussions over recent strikes on UN peacekeepers UNIFIL in Lebanon, where Israel is also at war with Hamas ally Hezbollah.Borrell suggested that the peacekeepers' mandate should be beefed up by the UN Security Council to give them more scope to act amid repeated attacks on their positions, which they blame on Israeli forces.""They cannot act by themselves, it is certainly a limited role,"" he said.Earlier on Saturday, Borrell wrote on social media that ""a more robust mandate for UNIFIL"" was needed.In Lebanon on Friday, Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni slammed as ""unacceptable"" the recent strikes on UNIFIL.Italy has around 1,000 troops in the UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon, which has soldiers from more than 50 countries.- Ukraine prospects -The G7's pledge of continued support for Ukraine comes as the country enters its third winter at war, with battlefield losses in the east and the prospect of reduced US military support should Donald Trump be elected to the White House next month.Biden urged Nato allies during a visit to Berlin on Friday not to step down in backing Ukraine, saying that supporters of Kyiv ""cannot let up"".Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, under mounting pressure from Western allies to forge a winning strategy against Russia, on Thursday presented what he called a ""victory plan"" to the European Union and Nato.Its main thrust is a call for immediate Nato membership, deemed unfeasible by alliance members.It also demands the ability to strike military targets inside Russia with long-range weapons, and an undefined ""non-nuclear strategic deterrence package"" on Ukrainian territory.Another worry for Ukraine are reports, based on South Korean intelligence, that North Korea is deploying large numbers of troops to support Moscow's war against Ukraine.Nato was not as yet able to confirm that intelligence, Rutte said on Friday.","G7 defence ministers pledge ""unwavering support"" for Ukraine. But they also warn of the dangers of further intensification in the Middle East. The ministers call for Iran to stop supporting Hamas and Hezbollah.

At least seven people died on Saturday when part of a ferry dock collapsed on Sapelo Island , Georgia, during cultural day celebrations. The event was organised by the island’s Gullah-Geechee community, descendants of Black slaves.The incident occurred at around 4:30 pm when a boat struck the dock, causing a gangway at the dock to collapse, plunging people into the water during the annual celebrations.""Several people fell into the water after the collapse,"" a McIntosh County commissioner said, as reported by CNN.Authorities said that several individuals were taken to hospitals following the collapse. The exact number of injured remains unclear, according to the Georgia department of natural resources. The US coast guard , McIntosh County fire department, and Georgia department of natural resources are searching the water for more victims.“There have been seven confirmed fatalities,” said natural resources department spokesperson Tyler Jones. “Multiple people have been transported to area hospitals, and we are continuing to search the water for individuals.”According to Jones, there were about 20 people on the dock when it collapsed. Among the fatalities was a chaplain for the state agency, Jones added.Search efforts involved helicopters and boats equipped with side-scanning sonar.Authorities are investigating the cause of the collapse.Georgia governor Brian Kemp expressed his sorrow over the incident, saying, “As state and local first responders continue to work this active scene, we ask that all Georgians join us in praying for those lost, for those still in harm’s way, and for their families.”Sapelo Island, located about 60 miles south of Savannah, is accessible only by boat. The dock collapse occurred during the island's cultural day, an annual event celebrating the Gullah-Geechee community, also known as the Hogg Hummock community. This community, consisting of descendants of former slaves from the Thomas Spalding cotton plantation, has a rich history and close-knit bonds. Hogg Hummock was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996.Roger Lotson, the only Black member of the McIntosh County board of commissioners, stressed the community's unity in times of tragedy. “Everyone is family, and everyone knows each other,” he said. “In any tragedy, especially like this, they are all one. They’re all united. They all feel the same pain and the same hurt.”","At least seven people died when part of a ferry dock collapsed on Sapelo Island, Georgia, during cultural day celebrations.

Like Epstein's list, a list of names, all celebrities, with links to P Diddy and his Freak sessions, are doing the rounds on social media.The alleged list contains names of Leonardo Dicaprio , Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Ashton Kutcher, Paris Hilton, Howard Stern, Russell Brand, Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez, Russell Simmons, Usher, Meghan Fox. The list goes viral as Usher, Pink deleted their X posts and theories that Justin Bieber might have been a victim of Diddy float around.Nobody has been implicated in the Sean Combs case so far.P Diddy is facing serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering where he forced women to have sex with male prostitutes that continued for days as the entire action was caught on camera. Huge stocks of baby oil, drugs were found at Diddy's sex den while Diddy did not plead guilty to the charges.Usher who once stayed with Diddy said his X account got hacked and that's why all his past posts disappeared. This happened as his old statement in which said he witnessed wild things when he stayed with Diddy resurfaced.Apart from Usher and Pink, Megan Fox deleted all her posts on Instagram and X triggering speculations over how she was linked to Diddy.An old snipped of Khloe Kardashian claiming that she attended one of Diddy's naked parties emerged. ""I got on a plane at 5:30 am. Well this party...I think half the people there were butt naked,"" this is exactly what Khloe said about Diddy's party.Diddy was Justin Bieber's mentor but Bieber's spokesperson said he is trying not to focus on the charges and accusation of Diddy. Justin is in a happy bubble since he became a father.As the list of the Hollywood A-listers becomes long, they are maintaining absolute silence over Diddy's arrest.An officer involved in the raid on Diddy's home compared him to Jeffrey Epstein, stating that Diddy was part of the same social circle as Epstein and Harvey Weinstein. The officer claimed there were 15 years of wild parties, suggesting that while not everyone who attended was complicit in trafficking, they witnessed inappropriate behavior. He emphasized that many people knew what went on, especially as things became more explicit late at night.Also read on the Diddy case:","No Hollywood A-lister has been implicated in the Sean Diddy trafficking case but several 'Diddy lists' are viral.

But now his 'vacuous' claims have put the Royal Family staff on alert as the King and the Queen are on their Australia tour and the British-born Australian man wants to counter them.In May, Simon said he will use to the Royal visit to get his answers.""What am I going to do this time? Well, I'd be a very silly person not to take action when he comes into the same jurisdiction as me. But I think I'd be even sillier to reveal my hand prematurely,"" Simon said earlier without revealing his entire plan.Daily Mail reported that close protection experts have confirmed the Australian will be closely watched by Royal bodyguards while the King and Queen are in the country.""There is probably around 20 names on that watchlist already. And certainly anyone making a noise publicly will be of high interest. Background searches will have already been carried out on any names they have and it's standard to do psych evaluations based on any criminal conviction and social media,"" a protection expert told Daily Mail Australia.Dorante-Day posted a message on Facebook on Thursday in which he wrote: ""Hi Everyone, I have been busy for the past few weeks working on a case against the Queensland Police Service for their continued breach of duty, which was filed in the Queensland Supreme Court on Monday. As a family not only have, we had to deal with the public awareness of my adoption issue, but we have also had to deal with the abuse, harassment, threats and menacing of certain sections of society. For nearly four years now we’ve been forced to endure this treatment and its long overdue that it is legally addressed.""""The primary focus of this case can be centrally framed around one thing, the rights of the adopted person, the adoptee. These rights, legislatively established at the original adoption of the child, exist throughout the lifespan of the adoptee, and are primarily focused on the “best interests and welfare of” the adoptee. It is apparent these rights are transparent to the QPS and that they are not upholding firstly, their duty of care to my family and I, and secondly, my human rights under the Queensland Human Rights Act,"" he wrote.Dorante-Day claimed that he was adopted in August 1966 when he was about eight months old. His grandmother worked for the Royal Family and he claimed to be the love child of Camilla and Charles. In 1966, Camilla was 18 and Charles 17. He claimed to be the actual heir to the UK throne. He also claimed that after his birth, Charles was sent to Australia to study and Camilla disappeared from the public eye.“The fact that the left side of my face identically matches Charles whilst neither William nor Harry’s does, raises the obvious question, just who are Charles’s real sons?” Dorante-Day wrote in a Facebook post.King Charles and Queen Camilla touched down in Sydney on Friday night -- beginning their tour of Australia and Samoa where the King will attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting between October 21 and 26.",Simon Dorante-Day has been claiming that he is the lovechild of King Charles and Camilla who was given up for adoption soon after his birth.

This news is going to really fly.”During the announcement, Musk also shared the name of the first recipient, John Breyer, who expressed his astonishment, saying, “Thanks, Elon.This is great.

Did Hurricane Milton wash ashore a '1700s Ghost Ship' in St. Augustine?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-hurricane-milton-wash-ashore-a-1700s-ghost-ship-in-st-augustine/articleshow/114383291.cms,"Expert Debunks the myth

Can Hurricanes actually cause 'ghost ships' to wash ashore?



(Inputs taken from Pensacola news Journal)

There was a social media buzz on Wednesday with rumours of a “1700s ghost ship” that allegedly washed ashore near St. Augustine , Florida , following Hurricane Milton . Despite several inconsistencies, the story went viral, captivating thousands of users.However, it was eventually debunked as false.The rumour emerged a week after Hurricane Milton made landfall in Florida.Despite the fact that the storm hit on October 9—exactly one week before the alleged sighting—and on the opposite side of the state, the ghost ship story still gained significant traction. The original post amassed over 21,000 shares, with users spreading the narrative widely.As it turns out, the ghost ship tale was a piece of satire. It originated from Casper Planet , a Facebook page known for its humorous and entirely fabricated stories, similar to The Onion.Casper Planet posted a follow-up story on Friday morning titled, “Tourists Outraged After Discovering Non-Existent 1700s Pirate Ship in Florida ‘Wasn’t Real’ All Along.” The page continued to poke fun at the viral spread of the ghost ship narrative.In its initial post, Casper Planet claimed that the ship had “emerged from the ocean’s depths as the Category 4 storm [Hurricane Milton] churned the Atlantic, sending the ancient ship onto the beach.” The dramatic description added a sense of mystery, but it was factually inaccurate. Hurricane Milton had made landfall as a Category 3 storm near Siesta Key, on Florida’s central west coast. It then crossed the state’s peninsula, exiting near Brevard and Indian River counties—over 120 miles from St. Augustine.To lend the story an air of credibility, the page included a fabricated quote from a fictional marine archaeologist named “Dr. Andrew Clarke,” who said, “This is unprecedented. To see a ship this old, in such good condition, simply appear out of the ocean during a hurricane − it’s both fascinating and chilling.”According to First Coast News report, Chuck Meide, director of the Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program at the St. Augustine Lighthouse & Museum. Meide debunked the ghost ship claim, explaining that the depiction of the ship was unrealistic.“Most of the wood from a ship hundreds of years old would have been eaten by critters like ship worms,” Meide explained. In cases where parts of such ancient ships do survive, it’s typically the lower portion of the vessel, which gets buried beneath the seafloor.While the ghost ship story was a hoax, there is some truth to the concept of hurricanes washing abandoned ships ashore. In fact, such incidents have occurred in the past.According to Weather.com, a 45-foot ghost ship named Lady Catherine III washed ashore on Pensacola Beach on June 18 during Tropical Storm Alberto. The vessel, battered but still intact, was found with no passengers on board. It was later discovered that the boat belonged to Michael Barlow, a Texas man who had abandoned it earlier that month after encountering the storm.In another instance, a 45-foot sailboat called Cuki broke free from its mooring in Key West during Hurricane Irma in 2017. The boat drifted over 300 miles up Florida’s eastern coast before washing ashore at Spessard Holland South Beach Park. USA Today reported that the boat remained there for two years before it was demolished. Its owner, Jeffrey Sundwall of Key West, was later imprisoned at Jackson Correctional Institute in Malone, Florida, on charges including sexual battery, cocaine possession, obstruction of a criminal investigation, and possession of child pornography.","The rumour emerged a week after Hurricane Milton made landfall in Florida.

Troop Movements and Evidence

Implications for the Conflict

International Reactions

Seoul and Kyiv have reported the deployment of North Korean troops to support Russia in its ongoing war in Ukraine , raising serious concerns about escalating tensions in the region. According to South Korea 's intelligence agency, approximately 1,500 special forces troops have already arrived in Russia’s Far East for training and acclimatization, with estimates suggesting that the total number could eventually reach as high as 12,000.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky further intensified these concerns, claiming that North Korea is preparing to send an additional 10,000 soldiers to bolster Moscow’s military efforts. In response to these developments, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin stated that he could not confirm the reports of troop movements but acknowledged that if true, it would be concerning.Both North Korea and Russia have denied allegations of troop deployments. In light of these reports, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol convened a security meeting, stressing that the international community must respond using ""all available means."" South Korean intelligence revealed that North Korean soldiers were issued Russian military uniforms, weapons, and fake IDs, suggesting an attempt to disguise their presence on the battlefield.Experts believe that this deployment marks a significant solidification of the military alliance between North Korea's Kim Jong Un and Russia's Vladimir Putin, established during their meeting in June, which included a mutual defense clause. Analyst Hong Min from the Korea Institute for National Unification stated, ""This establishes a framework where Russia's intervention or military support will automatically occur if North Korea is attacked or faces a crisis.""As the conflict in Ukraine evolves, Ukrainian officials have warned of a significant escalation risk, with North Korean troops predicted to enhance Russia's capacity to maintain control over occupied territories. Kyiv's military intelligence chief, Kyrlo Budanov, estimated that around 2,600 North Korean soldiers are expected to be deployed in Kursk by November 1.Meanwhile Stratcom Center (The Centre for Strategic Communication and Information Security of Ukraine) claimed the presence of North Korean troops in Russian. In a video released on X it said, ""Newly obtained footage from Russia's Sergievsky Training Ground showing North Korean troops being outfitted in Russian gear in preparation for deployment to Ukraine.""Recent reports indicated that video footage showed North Korean troops arriving at Russian military bases in Vladivostok and picking up military equipment. The South Korean spy agency disclosed that the initial contingent of 1,500 troops is likely to be just the beginning, with the final figure possibly reaching 12,000.Ukrainian foreign minister Andriy Sybiga emphasized the ""huge threat of further escalation,"" as North Korean forces are expected to enter the battlefield within days. The South Korean National Intelligence Service (NIS) speculated that this effort to disguise North Korean troops as Russian soldiers is part of a broader strategy.The involvement of North Korean troops adds complexity to the conflict. While reports suggest these special operations forces are well-trained, their lack of advanced military equipment raises questions about their effectiveness. Expert Hazel Smith remarked, ""If there are soldiers, the only reason they are likely to be special operations soldiers is that North Korea can’t risk sending conscripts as they don’t trust conscripts; their priority would be to defect or disappear.""The North Korea-Russia alliance has implications not only for the current conflict but also for regional security dynamics. This deployment could facilitate Russia's ability to hold onto occupied territories or assist in further territorial advances in Ukraine.Despite denials from Russia and North Korea regarding troop movements, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin recognized the seriousness of the situation but noted that definitive evidence is still lacking. Nato chief Mark Rutte added that there is currently no evidence to support claims of North Korean troop involvement.The United States has urged transparency on this issue, with Mike Turner, a Republican member of the House of Representatives, demanding a briefing from the White House about intelligence assessments related to North Korean troop movements. He expressed frustration over the administration's failure to provide sufficient information to Congress.","1,500 special forces troops have already arrived in Russia’s Far East for training and acclimatization.

Jewish support for Democrats at historic low since Reagan era ahead of 2024 election: Poll,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jewish-support-for-democrats-at-historic-low-since-reagan-era-ahead-of-2024-election-poll/articleshow/114380646.cms,"Declining support for Democrats among Jewish voters

Concerns over antisemitism within the Democratic Party



Diverging views on key issues



Concerns over free speech and university policies



Denominational differences among Jewish voters



Info-graph via Manhattan Institute report





A recent poll conducted by the Manhattan Institute has revealed that Jewish support for the Democratic Party is at its lowest since the Reagan era, as Vice President Kamala Harris struggles to rally voters ahead of the 2024 presidential election. The survey, carried out between October 5 and 9, included a representative sample of 658 Jewish registered voters across the United States and highlighted growing concerns within the Jewish community regarding antisemitism , Israel, and other policy issues.While Jewish voters remain predominantly aligned with the Democratic Party, their support is weakening. According to the Manhattan Institute poll, Harris is poised to perform worse among Jewish voters than any Democratic candidate since the 1980s. If the election were held today, the poll indicates that Harris would secure 67% of the Jewish vote, while former President Donald Trump would receive 31%. This shift in support marks a significant departure from past election cycles.Historically, Jewish voters have shown strong support for Democratic candidates. In 1992, Bill Clinton secured 80% of the Jewish vote over George Bush Sr. However, support has gradually declined; Joe Biden received 68% of the Jewish vote in 2020, while Hillary Clinton won 71% in 2016. The trend of declining Jewish support for Democrats has accelerated since the October 7, 2023, terrorist attacks on Israel by Hamas.The poll’s findings reveal that Jewish voters are increasingly uneasy about the Democratic Party’s stance on antisemitism. A significant 62% of respondents expressed concern over growing antisemitism within the party. Jesse Arm, Chief of Staff at the Manhattan Institute, noted, “Many are likely uncomfortable with the Democratic Party’s tolerance of voices that criticize Israel in extreme terms, such as labeling the country ‘genocidal.’ This is evidenced by the fact that Jews are almost universally supportive of Israel—a mere 5% of Jewish voters say they are not supporters of the Jewish state.”The survey also found that Jewish voters are largely united in their support for Israel, with 86% expressing strong support for the Jewish state. “Security, Israel, and antisemitism” were identified as Harris’s weakest issues relative to Trump among Jewish voters, indicating that these topics are pivotal in shaping Jewish voter preferences ahead of the election.Despite the overall decline in support for the Democratic Party, Jewish voters still align with Democrats on specific issues, such as abortion. A majority of Jewish Republicans also described themselves as pro-choice. In contrast, on immigration, crime, and fiscal matters, Jewish voters’ views diverge, showing a mix of moderate and conservative positions. For instance, Jewish voters want increased vetting in the immigration process but are generally supportive of expanding high-skilled immigration.On crime, Jewish voters are more in line with Republican views, feeling that the nation’s criminal justice system is not tough enough. They are also fiscally moderate, expressing concern over government spending while supporting higher taxes on middle- to upper-income brackets.The poll also shed light on Jewish voters' perspectives on free speech and university policies. Jewish respondents expressed support for laws banning people from covering their faces with the intent to conceal their identity in public places, a stance that gained traction following incidents of anti-Israel activists intimidating Jewish students on college campuses and targeting Jewish community members across the US.Additionally, Jewish voters expressed a desire for universities to be held accountable, supporting taxation on university endowments. They also showed a preference for a color-blind society over race-conscious policies, revealing divided opinions on affirmative action and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives.The poll highlighted denominational differences within the Jewish community regarding support for Harris and Trump. Harris’s strongest backing came from Reform and unaffiliated or nondenominational Jews, who are traditionally more aligned with progressive causes. However, her support was notably weaker among Conservative Jewish voters, and Orthodox Jewish voters showed a preference for Trump, leading him by 18 points.Religious observance also played a role in voter preferences. Among Jewish voters who attend religious services weekly, Harris led Trump by a narrow margin of 51% to 46%. In contrast, those who never attend services overwhelmingly supported Harris, with a 75% to 24% lead over Trump.","A recent poll conducted by the Manhattan Institute has revealed that Jewish support for the Democratic Party is at its lowest since the Reagan era.

HYDERABAD: In a public rally on Friday, leading Pakistpolitician Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari warned that if political parties in parliament do not reach a consensus on the 26th constitutional amendment , he will push the amendment through parliament using a brute, or two-thirds majority, Dawn reported. Bilawal Bhutto Zardari is the chairperson of the Pakistan People's Party which is led by his father Asif Ali Zardari who is the President of Pakistan.Pakistan People's Party ( PPP ) is in coalition with PM Shehbaz Sharif 's Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML-N). These two parties along with Fazlur Rehman's Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI-F) have come together to implement the 26th constitutional amendment in Pakistan's constitution.While addressing a PPP rally in Pakistan's Hyderabad city to mark the anniversary of the attack on his mother's homecoming parade in 2007, Bilawal Bhutto said, ""It is my desire to have consensus among all political parties in parliament for this amendment. The second option, which is not my preferred path, is to rely on the majority's vote to pass it,"" Dawn noted.He urged political parties to consider the future and work towards raising the dignity of parliament, adding that they operate within a certain ""political space"".Bhutto noted that while the PPP was unable to establish a constitutional court during its 2008-2013 government, he is committed to fulfilling the promise made by Benazir Bhutto.He acknowledged opposition to the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), particularly fromPTI leaders, but insisted that the new court would ensure equal representation for all provinces.PTI has been protesting across Pakistan against the implementation of the constitutional amendments as the Party alleges that the bill would undermine the powers of judiciary.PTI leaders have also alleged that bribes up to Rs 1 Billion are being offered to lawmakers to garner support for passing the amendment law.In the public rally, Bilawal Bhutto gave out historical justifications for implementation of the 26th amendment saying that even Muhammad Ali Jinnah had called for a separate court for routine justice matters at the 1930 Round Table Conference.The FCC, Bhutto claimed, would protect the rights of provinces by providing equal representation and addressing disputes between the federation and provinces.As per Dawn, Bhutto insisted that his mother and former Pakistan PM Benazir Bhutto had supported the establishment of the FCC because she understood the ""real face"" of the judiciary, which he said had repeatedly legitimised dictatorial rule.""After abolishing the 'One Unit' system in the country through parliament, my mother wanted to eliminate the concept of 'One Unit' in the judiciary as well,"" he added.",Bilawal Bhutto Zardari is the chairperson of the Pakistan People's Party.

NEW DELHI: Police in Pakistan used tear gas and batons to disperse student protesters on Thursday after they ransacked a college building. The protests erupted over an alleged on-campus rape in Lahore that has sparked anger and demonstrations in four cities.Reports of the incident spread on social media, increasing tensions on college campuses. Students in Rawalpindi, Punjab province, burned furniture and blocked a key road before vandalizing a college building.Earlier, a security guard died during clashes between student protesters and police in Gujrat, also in Punjab province. Authorities arrested one person related to the guard's death and another for spreading misinformation about the alleged rape.In Lahore, over two dozen students were injured earlier this week while demanding justice for the alleged victim, who students claim was raped at the Punjab Group of Colleges.In response to the growing unrest, the government banned rallies in Punjab. The Federal Investigation Agency filed cases against 36 people accused of spreading misinformation on social media.Authorities, including the Punjab chief minister, and the woman’s parents denied any assault happened. However, Punjab police called on the public to share any information regarding the alleged rape.The unrest seems to have started spontaneously, as student unions in Pakistan have been banned since 1984.These protests also come after a woman reported being gang-raped during a polio vaccination drive in Sindh province last month. Police arrested three men involved, but the woman's husband expelled her from home, citing damage to the family name.","Protests erupted over an alleged on-campus rape in Lahore that has sparked anger.

Pakistan's Punjab CM blames PTI party

Senior directors of a Pakistan college stated on Wednesday that there was no evidence to support claims of a student being raped on campus, despite reports circulating online that led to several days of protests. The allegations, which spread through social media posts, claimed that a woman was raped in the basement of a Punjab College for Women campus in Lahore .In response to the posts, hundreds of students, mostly male, engaged in protests that involved smashing windows and burning school buses. These demonstrations reflect a growing concern in Pakistan regarding safety, harassment, and sexual violence.Arif Chaudry, the Lahore director of the private Punjab Group of Colleges , which operates the women's college, was quoted by AFP during a press conference saying, ""The incident does not exist. I will resign and I will leave this profession and stand with the students if the incident took place.""Another director of the group, Agha Tahir Ijaz, urged students not to believe misinformation during the same news conference.As the anger grew over the alleged incident, police arrested a security guard who was identified in the online posts. However, they reported that no victim had come forward and that they were unable to verify the incident.The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) cybercrime wing has initiated an investigation targeting individuals responsible for disseminating the information via social media channels which is now claimed to be false.The protests, which began at two of the college's campuses on Monday afternoon, quickly spread to several other colleges throughout the city and continued for three days and resulted in injuries to at least 28 people.As the college denied the claims, Maryam Nawaz , the chief minister of Pakistan's Punjab also addressed the alleged rape incident, asserting that the accusations were 'fabricated'.Nawaz further claimed that the political party led by Imran Khan , Pakistan's former prime minister who is currently imprisoned, exploited the false allegation to provoke extensive student demonstrations and cause instability throughout the province.The Punjab government has closed the college campus where the alleged rape was said to have occurred until further notice. ""On social media, a factory of lies is running. PTI's politics have sunk so low that it is exploiting tragedies for political gain,"" Maryam said while warning that those responsible for spreading the false posts would face punishment.

Islamabad 'lockdown' greets Chinese PM amid aftershocks of Karachi suicide attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/islamabad-lockdown-greets-chinese-pm-amid-aftershocks-of-karachi-suicide-attack/articleshow/114231377.cms,"ISLAMABAD: PM Li Qiang of China arrived in Islamabad Monday to a 21-gun salute and a security overdrive that included shutting schools and businesses in the capital city for three days as Pakistan pulled out all stops to avoid any safety slip-up during the first visit by a Chinese premier to the country in 11 years.Li's four-day trip to oversee the signing of bilateral trade and economic agreements, inaugurate an international airport in the southwestern port city of Gwadar, and attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit comes just over a week after a suicide attack near Karachi airport in which two Chinese engineers died and 11 others were wounded.As PM Shehbaz Sharif and members of his cabinet received Li at the Chaklala airbase in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, adjacent to Islamabad, news arrived of at least three cops and as many militants being killed during an attack on the district police headquarters in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.A wave of violence has swept Pakistan lately, including 21 miners being shot and killed in Balochistan, where the new Gwadar airport is located. Li is likely to virtually inaugurate the CPEC-funded airport in the southwestern province, bordering Afghanistan and Iran.Neither side commented on the reason for a virtual inauguration, but sources cited heightened security concerns following the recent Karachi attack for Li being advised against travelling to a restive region.Islamabad, too, has sought to temporarily curb the movements of Chinese nationals in the country, citing fears of violence from armed groups. Officials said the Karachi blast is likely to figure in talks between Li and his Pakistani counterpart.“We will review progress on existing initiatives, especially the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ), and also explore new avenues of mutually beneficial cooperation. The Pakistan-China all-weather strategic cooperative partnership is the cornerstone of regional stability and prosperity,” Shehbaz wrote on X.According to the foreign office, Li will also call on President Asif Ali Zardari and hold meetings with parliamentary members and the senior military leadership.The two-day SCO meeting starts Tuesday in Islamabad. The administration announced a three-day public holiday in the capital city, beginning Monday, with contingents of police, army and paramilitary forces out on the streets in what appeared to be a veritable lockdown.The SCO participants include the PMs of Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. India's foreign minister, S Jaishankar, and Iran's vice-president, Mohammad Reza Aref, are also expected at the summit.Jaishankar has already stated that he wouldn't discuss bilateral ties with Pakistan during his visit, the first in nearly a decade.The opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) of jailed ex-PM Imran Khan announced a protest Tuesday in Islamabad if the govt did not allow his family members, lawyers and doctors to meet him in prison.","PM Li Qiang of China arrived in Islamabad Monday to a 21-gun salute and a security overdrive that included shutting schools and businesses in the capital city for three days.
