The area has been cordoned off and reinforcements deployed.According to official sources, the slain policemen includes a head constable and two constables. The bodies were yet to be evacuated from the site as the operation continues.Grenades and rocket fire rocked the area with multiple explosions. “The gunfire continued throughout the day,” an official said late at night, adding that the wounded security personnel were taken to Kathua and Jammu hospitals, where they are reported to be in stable condition.The attackers are believed to be the same group that managed to escape after a brief gunfight Sunday evening near Sanyal village in Hiranagar sector, close to the Pakistan border. Sufain’s forests are about 35km from Sanyal village.The security forces had closed in on the terrorists hiding in a remote, mountain hut — one of many built by nomadic herders who roam the area with their livestock. But they slipped away, triggering a manhunt across the region.The search entered its fourth day, with the Army, NSG, BSF, CRPF, and J&K police deploying advanced surveillance tools, bulletproof vehicles, UAVs, drones, and sniffer dogs.On Monday, search teams found four loaded magazines of an M4 carbine, two grenades, a bulletproof jacket, sleeping bags, tracksuits, and materials for making IEDs. A breakthrough came the next day when a woman in Dinga Amb village reported seeing two men in combat clothing asking for water. This prompted an expansion of the search.Also read: 'Separatism breathing its last': Amit Shah hails 'new Bharat' as two more Hurriyat affiliates quit Security has been tightened along Jammu-Pathankot national highway and link roads leading to border villages to plug potential escape routes for the terrorists.In Rajouri district, security forces found a terrorist hideout in Manyal Gali forests of Thanamandi, seizing live rounds, a grenade, a gas cylinder, a solar panel, and food supplies.Terrorist activities sparked protests in Jammu, where Dogra Front and Shiv Sena activists burned a Pakistani flag, denouncing cross-border terrorism.","Three J&K policemen and an equal number of suspected Pakistani terrorists killed in gunfight.

SRINAGAR: As thousands of people took to the streets on Friday in different areas of Kashmir to observe Al-Quds Day in solidarity with Palestine, J&K police have registered an FIR under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act against the organisers at some places for raising pro-Hezbollah slogans and flags. Al-Quds is Arabic for Jerusalem.Kashmiri protesters carrying banners that read “Free Palestine” marched through the busy markets of Srinagar, Budgam, and other districts. The demonstrators, including women and children, called for an end to Israeli “occupation of Palestinian territories”.Every year on Al-Quds Day, officially known as International Quds Day , Kashmir witnesses protests in support of Palestinians. It is an annual pro-Palestinian event held on the last Friday of the Islamic month of Ramadan. Many speakers said that Kashmir stands in solidarity with the “oppressed people of Palestine”.A police statement said a case has been registered against the organisers and participants of a Youm-e-Quds procession in Beerwah, Budgam, “for creating a law and order situation by raising objectionable slogans”.“By sloganeering, organisers tried to create a law and order situation, thereby causing obstruction to smooth movement of the general public,” police said. Police have registered a case under various BNS sections.In the north Kashmir district of Baramulla police registered a case under UAPA against people involved for what it said amounted to “promoting terrorism by displaying Hezbollah flags and raising slogans in support of the militant group”. J&K police lodged an FIR at police station Pattan against a group of people seen carrying Hezbollah flags, placards, and banners featuring photographs of the Hezbollah commander.“The individuals were also heard raising slogans in support of Hezbollah with the intent to incite the general public and encourage elements associated with terrorist organisations to engage in subversive activities and to revive terrorist activities within the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir,” police said.“Police have initiated their investigation into the matter and swift action is assured against those found involved in activities that threaten peace and stability in the region,” police said.","Kashmiri protesters carrying banners that read ‘Free Palestine’ marched through the busy markets of Srinagar, Budgam, and other districts.

"J&K: Kathua encounter enters day 2, bodies of 3 policemen recovered",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jk-kathua-encounter-enters-day-2-bodies-of-3-policemen-recovered/articleshow/119666288.cms,"(PTI photo)

NEW DELHI: The bodies of three Jammu and Kashmir policemen killed in an encounter with Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists were recovery on Friday, as the gunfight in Jammu's Kathua district stretched into its second day.The fourth policeman's body was located in the morning, but retrieval efforts were delayed as two terrorists continued firing from an elevated position.The encounter began on Thursday in Jakhole village, Ghati Juthana area, after security forces launched an operation against recently infiltrated terrorists from across the International Border. So far, four policemen and three terrorists have been killed, while seven security personnel, including a deputy superintendent of police (DSP), have been injured.Heavy gunfire and explosions continued as police, the Army, and CRPF advanced through difficult terrain. It is unclear if these terrorists were part of a group that earlier escaped a security cordon in Hiranagar’s Sanyal forest or a separate infiltration.The bodies of the policemen—Balwinder Singh Chib, Jaswant Singh, and Tariq Ahmed—were recovered after a day of search efforts. Their service weapons were missing, but officials have not confirmed whether the terrorists took them.Director General of Police (DGP) Nalin Prabhat received the bodies at the medical college before a ceremonial tribute at district police lines in Kathua.The officers had been protecting the SDPO leading the search party when they were ambushed. The SDPO was later evacuated in an injured state. Three other policemen and two Army personnel are also hospitalised but stable.Earlier, a group of terrorists was spotted in Sanyal village near the International Border. Security forces launched a massive search operation using advanced surveillance tools, but the terrorists managed to escape and later resurfaced near Jakhole, about 30 km away. Search teams later found weapons, grenades, bulletproof vests, and bomb-making materials near the original encounter site.Reinforcements from the police, Army, and CRPF were sent to the area, while special forces were airdropped to hunt down the terrorists. Security officials believe the terrorists infiltrated last Saturday, possibly through a ravine or a newly built tunnel.The People's Anti-Fascist Front (PAFF), a front for Jaish-e-Mohammed, has claimed responsibility for the attack.Jammu police officials have been overseeing operations in Kathua for the past four days. The Army’s Rising Star Corps paid tribute to the fallen officers, saying on X: ""Rising Star Corps salutes the valour and indomitable spirit of the brave (J-K) Police personnel who made the supreme sacrifice fighting valiantly during the ongoing OP Safiyan in Kathua. Their courage and dedication will always be remembered.""","The bodies of three policemen killed in an encounter with Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists were recovery on Friday.

Punjab AG Gurminder Singh, meanwhile, informed SC that farmer neta Jagjit Dallewal broke his indefinite fast Friday.Kisan netas were taken into custody on March 19 after meeting a ministerial delegation over their demands, which include MSP and crop loan waivers .On Dallewal breaking his fast, the apex court said, “We always said he is a genuine farmer leader. But there were other elements who did not want a resolution of the issues. We know this as we are aware of the ground situation and do not live in ivory towers.”Regarding the demands of farmers, SC said it would consider requesting Centre to find measures to address their grievances after Punjab govt files a fresh report on the situation. It also asked SC-appointed committee to submit a supplementary report on issues raised by farmers.On Friday, many of the released farm leaders prayed at a gurdwara in Patiala and met Dallewal in hospital. They said they would take stock of the situation and then decide the future course of action.Dallewal finally sipped water after eight days, doing so in the presence of Punjab govt emissaries. Dallewal had stopped drinking water since the arrests, demanding the release of all fellow farm leaders. He had also sought compensation for belongings of farmers that went missing from protest sites following the police action last week.Earlier, a habeas corpus petition in Punjab and Haryana high court over Dallewal was disposed of. The court was told that he was not in illegal confinement, was admitted to hospital of his volition, and that his family was free to meet him.","Kisan netas were taken into custody on March 19 after meeting a ministerial delegation over their demands.

"Poor, virgin UP girls exploited in tantric ritual",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/poor-virgin-up-girls-exploited-in-tantric-ritual/articleshow/119678475.cms,"MEERUT: In the dim, flickering light of oil lamps, amid the rhythmic hum of hollow chants, a young virgin girl from a poor family lay motionless—stripped off her clothes, her dignity, her will. Drugged and unaware, she was reduced to an “article”, a mere object in a perverse and sinister ritual. The videos that have emerged of the ritual are horrifying, and so are the details.A self-proclaimed “guru” or “kariagar”, handpicked by a powerful gang known as “media”, used to perform the tantric ritual—“kriya”, the objective being “dhan varsha” (shower of money) on the person for whom the ritual was being conducted. However, in its guise, young women were being blatantly exploited.On Friday, Sambhal police arrested 14 men, all part of a well-entrenched and organised syndicate that exploited women in the name of the ritual. Of the gang members inducted, four are so-called “gurus”, including Raghubir Singh (45), a railway station master at Yamuna Bridge railway station in Agra; Pappu Lal, Raghvendra Dayal (all three from Agra) and Sonu Singh from Firozabad.Additional SP, Sambhal, Anukriti Sharma, said, “The mobiles of the accused had hundreds of videos and images—a grotesque catalogue of victims. Men and women, aged 18 to 22, were videographed holding placards with their name, age, height, weight, body measurements and even the date of the last menstrual cycle in case of the women. Alongside them were images of owls, turtles and other trafficked wildlife—indicating sacrifices that were made of the animals.”The women hailed from different districts like Varanasi, Etah, Mathura and Firozabad. According to investigative agencies, the gang targeted families with limited financial resources and education on social media. They referred to the girls as “article”, “samaan” or “tomato”.For a girl to be chosen, she had to meet specific criteria. She must be a virgin, at least 5 feet 5 inches tall, and her body must be free of scars, injuries or tattoos. She had have no history of romantic or sexual relationships. The more beautiful her face, the more perfect her body, the greater the promise of wealth.“I got the ritual done on my daughter thrice but haven’t received the money so far,” said an Etah-based man. His daughter narrated her own ordeal, “I was made to sit in a room with the ‘guru’ and was given ‘prasad’ and asked to close my eyes. I do not remember anything after that.”","Police arrest 14 men, all part of a well-entrenched and organised syndicate.

Cops said the two had taken pills to end their lives. Diego also tried to slit his neck with a sickle and jumped into the water tank.The purported note by Diego—who had retired from Maharashtra govt —mentions that he was targeted by Sumit Birra and Anil Yadav since Jan this year. Posing as telecom officials from Delhi, the duo accused the couple of misusing their mobile SIM card to “commit criminal activities” and threatened digital arrest over it. Once they had forced the couple to part with Rs 5 lakh, they started asking for more money, the note says.Diego mentions in the note they took gold and “friendly loans” from individuals in Goa and Mumbai, and requested that these be repaid from proceeds of sale of their properties.In line with a wish expressed in Diego’s note, the couple’s bodies have been donated to Belagavi Institute of Medical Sciences (BIMS) for research.","Diego Santan Nazareth (83,) and wife Flaviana (80) were found dead in Belagavi’s Khanapur.

Tried to carry trolley with body

‘Conversation' with her body

‘My wife's calling me'

BENGALURU: The case of a 36-year-old man stabbing his wife to death during an argument and stuffing her body into a suitcase in their south Benglauru home before fleeing, is suspected to have been a premeditated, cold-blooded murder and not a spur-of-the-moment crime as police had initially surmised.Investigation revealed that the accused, Rakesh Rajendra Khedekar , had attempted to stuff his wife Gouri Anil Sambrekar , 32, into the suitcase even as she was alive and then tried to drag the trolley out of their home in Doddakammanahalli, near Hulimavu. But when the suitcase's handle broke, he abandoned the plan. He then moved it from the dining area to the bathroom, positioning it near the outlet pipe to drain the blood.""Rakesh appears to be acting as if he is mentally disturbed, but we suspect otherwise. He is perfectly fine and is just trying to gain sympathy by acting abnormal. He is misleading police. It appears he brought her to Bengaluru with a plan to kill her,"" a senior officer said.Rakesh and Gouri had shifted from Mumbai to Bengaluru only a month ago. Both worked in different private firms but quit their jobs. Rakesh managed to find a new work-from-home job in a tech firm in Bengaluru, while Gouri was still looking for work.On Wednesday, Gouri had prepared rice and gravy for dinner. Rakesh claimed they fought over a trivial issue around 9pm. Rakesh slapped her, and in retaliation, Gouri allegedly took a kitchen knife and hurled it at him. He sustained a minor injury. In a fit of rage, he is said to have taken the knife and stabbed her twice in the neck and once in the abdomen.Nail marks on his body show she fought back. As he gagged her, Gouri bled and started losing consciousness. Rakesh took a trolley suitcase and stuffed her into it. ""Forensic experts believe he stuffed her inside even as she was alive. At the crime scene, we found a large amount of mucus from her nose and mouth. The mucus comes out only if the person is alive; if the person is dead and stuffed, mucus will not come out. We suspect she died inside the suitcase,"" the officer added.After stuffing her into the suitcase, Rakesh tidied up the crime scene by washing it. Subsequently, he tried to carry the suitcase but the handle broke. So he dropped the plan and pulled the trolley to the bathroom. He locked the house from outside and sped away in his Honda City car around 12.45am Thursday.Rakesh wanted to drive to Mumbai and meet his parents. He switched off his phone before exiting the city. On the way to Pune, he switched it back on. He called Gouri's brother, Ganesh Anil Sambrekar, around 4pm, informed him he had killed Gouri in their house, and switched off his phone. Gouri's brother alerted local police in Maharashtra, who, in turn, alerted Hulimavu police inspector BG Kumaraswamy. A team was dispatched to locate the house.Meanwhile, Rakesh called Prabhu Singh, one of the tenants on the ground floor of the building where he lived. He informed Singh his wife had committed suicide by hanging and asked him to alert cops and the building owner. Singh called the landlord, who dialled the police helpline. Cops arrived, only to find the house locked. The door was broken open and police didn't find anyone hanging. They did, however, find Gouri's body in the suitcase.Based on mobile tower location, police found that Rakesh was near Shirwal, about 50km from Pune. When a city police officer spoke to him, he claimed to have spent all night talking to his wife's body and acted very disturbed. But when cops verified CCTV footage, they found he had left the home around midnight. Later, Rakesh claimed that he ‘spoke' to her body for only an hour, police said.Rakesh confessed that his wife was ‘dominating him' and had developed differences with his parents. She wanted to live separately, so he brought her to Bengaluru. However, she allegedly began blaming him for bringing her to the city, where she wasn't able to find a job.The officer explained that Rakesh claims to have sat next to his wife's body and asked her why she had behaved this way. ""We suspect he must have spoken for some time and spent the rest of the time cleaning the house,"" the cop added.According to police, Rakesh purchased phenyl and cockroach killer on his way to Shirwal, Maharashtra, and consumed it. ""He felt uneasy and narrated his ordeal to a passing biker, who took him to a Shirwal hospital. He is out of danger. He had told Maharashtra police that he attempted suicide as his wife was calling him. Once he is discharged, we will bring him to the city,"" a police officer said.Rakesh's father is Gouri's maternal uncle. She did her schooling while staying in Rakesh's house. The duo fell in love and were in a live-in relationship for four years. They married two years ago against the wishes of Gouri's family.Ganesh Anil Sambrekar and his wife came to Bengaluru and cremated Gouri at Wilson Garden crematorium.","Rakesh Rajendra Khedekar, 36, stabbed his wife Gouri Anil Sambrekar, 32, to death.

A massive 7.7-magnitude earthquake rocked Myanmar on Friday, sending shockwaves through Thailand and China, toppling buildings, and triggering widespread panic. The powerful tremor, centred near Sagaing, was followed by a strong 6.4-magnitude aftershock, shaking cities and forcing thousands to flee into the streets.In Bangkok, alarms blared as high-rise buildings swayed, while in Myanmar’s capital Naypyidaw, roads split open and structures crumbled. As emergency teams rushed to assess the damage, chilling videos surfaced of collapsing buildings and terrified residents scrambling for safety.Videos circulating on social media captured the moment an under-construction high-rise in Bangkok collapsed into a massive cloud of dust, with a crane still attached to the top of the structure. Witnesses could be heard screaming as debris rained down. Rescue workers rushed to the site near the popular Chatuchak Market, fearing that dozens of workers may have been trapped under the rubble.Footage from Bangkok also showed terrified residents evacuating high-rise buildings as water sloshed over the edges of rooftop pools. ""All of a sudden, the whole building began to move, and immediately there was screaming and panic,"" Fraser Morton, a tourist from Scotland told news agency AP. ""People were running in every direction, down escalators, and out onto the streets.""In Myanmar’s Mandalay region, a 90-year-old bridge collapsed, and sections of the highway linking Mandalay and Yangon suffered severe damage. Video clips shared online depicted cracked roads and frightened residents standing outside their homes. In Naypyidaw, the country’s capital, religious shrines were left in ruins, with parts of ancient structures crumbling to the ground. The National Museum was also affected, with ceiling panels falling as visitors rushed for safety.A team of journalists inside the capital’s main hospital reported chaotic scenes as injured victims arrived. ""The hospital has become a mass casualty area,"" said one medical worker told news agency AFP, as ambulances weaved through heavy traffic. Outside, wounded people lay on stretchers, intravenous drips hanging from makeshift stands, while relatives anxiously looked on.In Chiang Mai, Thailand’s northern tourist hub, people ran from shops and homes as the tremors hit. ""I have never felt anything like this before,"" said a 76-year-old local. ""I just grabbed what I could and ran outside."" The Thai government declared a state of emergency in response to the quake, with Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra cutting short an official trip to Phuket to lead an urgent meeting.The powerful tremors also reached China’s Yunnan province, where the Beijing earthquake agency recorded a magnitude of 7.9. However, no immediate reports of casualties emerged from the region.Seismologists have warned that Myanmar, particularly along the Sagaing Fault, remains prone to powerful earthquakes. In 2016, a 6.8-magnitude quake in Bagan caused significant damage to historic temples, and Friday’s tremor has once again raised concerns over the country’s infrastructure and emergency preparedness.As rescue efforts continue in both Myanmar and Thailand, authorities are bracing for aftershocks and potential further collapses.","A 7.7-magnitude earthquake rocked Myanmar on Friday, sending shockwaves through Thailand and China.

A monastery and a 90-year-old bridge were also destroyed, while a dam burst, flooding low-lying areas.Myanmar’s military leader, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, confirmed in a televised address that the death toll is expected to rise as rescue teams struggle to reach affected areas. The country’s already dire humanitarian situation has been exacerbated by damaged roads and power outages, making relief efforts even more challenging.Across the border in Thailand, tremors were felt as far as Bangkok, where a 33-storey building under construction collapsed. At least three workers were killed, and dozens remain missing under the rubble. Dramatic scenes unfolded as onlookers fled in panic, with sirens wailing across the city.

A federal appeals court on Friday lifted an earlier ruling that had blocked Elon Musk 's department of government efficiency ( DOGE ) from making further cuts to the US agency for international development ( USAID ).The lawsuit, one of the first directly targeting Musk, alleged that his involvement in dismantling USAID was unconstitutional since he was not an elected or Senate-confirmed official. A lower court had initially ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, agreeing that Musk's role in the cuts raised constitutional concerns. However, the 4th US circuit court of appeals sided with the administration, arguing that while DOGE was involved, final approval came from government officials.The panel dismissed claims that Musk personally ordered the cuts, despite his social media posts boasting that he ""fed USAID into the wood chipper."" The judges ruled that such statements did not constitute legal evidence of decision-making authority.Instead, they found that Musk was acting as an advisor to US President Donald Trump, supporting his broader mission to eliminate what he calls waste, fraud, and abuse in government agencies.""While defendants' role and actions related to USAID are not conventional, unconventional does not necessarily equal unconstitutional,"" wrote circuit judge Marvin Quattlebaum, a Trump appointee.The ruling halts a prior decision from US district judge Theodore Chuang in Maryland, who had ordered the government to restore email and computer access to USAID employees affected by the cuts. However, Chuang had stopped short of reversing firings or fully reinstating the agency.With the latest appeals court ruling, Musk's DOGE can continue overseeing budget cuts and downsizing efforts at USAID, though the broader legal battle over its constitutionality is expected to continue.",A federal appeals court lifted an earlier ruling that had blocked Elon Musk's department of government efficiency ( DOGE ) from making further cuts to USAID.

What Elon Musk said on Donald Trump’s 25% import tariff announcement on auto parts

US President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on auto imports and parts. “What we're going to be doing is a 25 percent tariff on all cars that are not made in the United States,” Trump said, as he signed the order in the Oval Office on March 26. The tariffs take effect on April 3 and apply to foreign-made cars, light trucks, and key auto parts. Responding to the development, Tesla CEO and Trump ally Elon Musk said that “this will affect the price of parts in Tesla cars that come from other countries”. Musk quoted a post by Tesla Owners Silicon Valley @teslaownersSV which said that “Trump imposes 25% tariff on all cars not made in the United States. Tesla could benefit the most on this.”Clarifying the post, Musk wrote: “To be clear, this will affect the price of parts in Tesla cars that come from other countries. The cost impact is not trivial.”President Donald Trump announced plans to impose tariffs on additional goods, including pharmaceuticals, noting that most drugs available in the U.S. are manufactured abroad, primarily in China and Ireland.Regarding reciprocal tariffs, Trump stated that the U.S. wouldn’t match exact levels set by trading partners but stressed that no country would be exempt.“We're going to make it to all countries, and we're going to make it very lenient,” he said. “I think people are going to be very surprised. It'll be, in many cases, less than the tariff that they've been charging us for decades.”He added that the U.S. would be “very fair” and “very nice” in its approach, despite what he described as unfair treatment by other nations.","US President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on auto imports and parts.

Trump signs executive order, targets Jenner & Block



US President Donald Trump faced back-to-back legal blows by judges. After the CFPB, the judges temporarily blocked key parts of Trump's executive orders targeting Jenner & Block and WilmerHale on FridayThe legal firms challenged the Republican president's actions in court, while Skadden Arps negotiated an agreement with the White House to avoid similar measures, Reuters reported.Bates criticised Trump's Jenner & Block order as ""disturbing"" and ""troubling"" for targeting the firm's pro bono work with transgender individuals and immigrants. The judge described much of the order's opening section - detailing accusations against the firm - as ""reprehensible.""Bates noted that Trump's directive appeared to prevent the firm's lawyers from entering federal courthouses under executive branch management.""Considering the firm-wide effects of the executive order, it threatens the existence of the firm,"" Bates added.In a separate ruling, US District Judge Richard Leon in Washington, overseeing the WilmerHale litigation , labelled Trump's order as retaliatory. He approved the firm's request to block sections limiting access to government buildings and officials, whilst declining to halt the suspension of security clearances for the firm's lawyers.The legal firms initiated their lawsuits against Trump's administration earlier on Friday, intensifying tensions between the president and legal professionals. They argued that Trump's directives violated constitutional rights to free expression and due process, intended to penalise opposition.Jenner & Block responded post-ruling: ""Consistent with the law, the court has agreed that this is an unconstitutional executive order holding no legal weight.""Jenner & Block said that its suit was intended to ""stop an unconstitutional executive order that has already been declared unlawful by a federal court."" A third firm, Perkins Coie, has also sued the Trump administration over the same matter, and had some early success in stopping the executive order.On Tuesday, President Donald Trump intensified his criticism of major US law firms by issuing an executive order against Jenner & Block, a firm that represents challengers to his key policies and previously employed a prosecutor involved in investigating his 2016 campaign.The directive followed similar orders against Perkins Coie and Paul Weiss, limiting their lawyers' security clearances and restricting their access to government facilities, officials and federal contracts.Trump referenced Jenner & Block's previous employment of Andrew Weissmann, a senior federal prosecutor who participated in former US Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation examining Russian connections with Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. Trump, facing four criminal cases after his presidency, has alleged that large law firms collaborated with Democrats against him and his supporters.White House Staff Secretary Will Scharf justified Trump's action by stating that Jenner & Block was ""weaponization of the legal system against American principles and values.""Jenner & Block responded with a statement indicating that the executive order was similar to one that ""has already been declared unconstitutional"" by a federal judge. The firm added, ""We remain focused on serving and safeguarding our clients' interests with the dedication, integrity, and expertise that has defined our firm for more than one hundred years and will pursue all appropriate remedies.""","US President Donald Trump faced back-to-back legal blows by judges.

Is Elon Musk bending election laws in Wisconsin Supreme Court race?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/is-elon-musk-bending-election-laws-in-wisconsin-supreme-court-race/articleshow/119684848.cms,"Has Musk done this before?

How is Musk involved in the race?

Tesla CEO Elon Musk faced legal challenges on Friday over his unprecedented support for the conservative candidate in Wisconsin's Supreme Court race, with accusations of violating state election laws.Earlier on Thursday evening, Musk announced plans for a Wisconsin rally on Sunday, promising to distribute $1 million cheques to two voters who had already participated in the election, as a gesture of gratitude for their participation.Wisconsin's legislation explicitly forbids offering valuable considerations in exchange for votes. This prompted numerous complaints, including legal action from Wisconsin's Democratic attorney seeking to prevent Musk's cheque distribution, according to the Associated Press.Following criticism, Musk removed the original post and published a modified proposal.""To clarify a previous post, entrance is limited to those who have signed the petition in opposition to activist judges. I will also hand over checks for a million dollars to 2 people to be spokesmen for the petition,"" he wrote on X.The initial announcement sparked widespread criticism ahead of Tuesday's election, which will establish the ideological balance of the state's highest court.On Friday, Attorney General Josh Kaul requested an emergency injunction from the circuit court to halt Musk's payments, describing them as an obvious violation of Wisconsin's anti-bribery laws.Concerns were also raised about Musk's political action committee, America First, offering $100 to Wisconsin voters who signed or shared a petition against ""activist judges"".The organisation recently awarded $1 million to Scott Ainsworth from Green Bay as a ""spokesperson for signing our Petition In Opposition To Activist Judges"". Ainsworth has previously supported Republicans and expressed backing for President Donald Trump.Various groups, including government oversight organisations and former officials, requested investigations into both the $1 million payment and $100 signing incentives.Wisconsin legislation classifies offering anything valuable to influence voting decisions as a felony.Legal specialists maintained that Musk's initial post offering monetary incentives to voters seemed to explicitly contravene the bribery law.""You cannot pay people to vote or not to vote,"" said Richard Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota and former White House ethics chief in the Bush administration.""He's running these lotteries based on whether people vote or not, it's illegal. And he's got to cut that out,"" he said.Regarding Musk's updated X post, Painter indicated that it ""at least purports to comply with Wisconsin law."" ""I guess that technically complies,"" he added.Musk's political action committee employed similar strategies before the previous presidential election, investing substantial sums to support President Donald Trump's re-election campaign.The initiative included offering daily payments of $1 million to voters in Wisconsin and six other key states who endorsed a petition supporting the First and Second Amendments.In Pennsylvania, while the district attorney pursued legal action to halt these payments, a judicial ruling determined that prosecutors couldn't establish the programme as an illegal lottery, allowing it to proceed until Election Day, the Associated Press reported.The Brennan Center for Justice reports that Musk-funded organisations, America PAC and Building for America's Future, have invested over $20 million to support conservative candidate Brad Schimel, who received Trump's endorsement last week.Schimel competes against Democratic-supported Susan Crawford from Dane County Circuit Court in a contest that will establish the court's ideological direction. The current court maintains a 4-3 liberal majority.Additionally, Musk has provided £3 million to Wisconsin's Republican Party, funds potentially transferable to Schimel's campaign.This external funding has established this as the costliest judicial election in American history, with expenditure exceeding $81 million, surpassing the previous $51 million record from two years prior.The election outcome will determine court control and has evolved into an assessment of Trump's initial weeks in office and Musk's influence.Musk's involvement coincided with Tesla's legal action against Wisconsin regarding dealership establishment permissions, a matter potentially reaching the justices.The Wisconsin Supreme Court anticipates ruling on significant national matters, including abortion rights, congressional redistricting and voting regulations, potentially influencing the 2026 midterms and 2028 presidential election.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk faced legal challenges on Friday over his unprecedented support for the conservative candidate in Wisconsin's Supreme Court race.

A powerful earthquake struck Myanmar and neighboring Thailand on Friday, destroying buildings, a bridge, and a dam. At least 694 people were killed in Myanmar, where photos and videos from two cities showed widespread damage. In Thailand, at least eight people died in the capital, where a high-rise building under construction collapsed.The earthquake had a magnitude of 7.7, with its epicenter near Mandalay , Myanmar’s second-largest city. A strong aftershock of 6.4 magnitude followed. The full extent of casualties and destruction was not immediately clear, especially in Myanmar, one of the world’s poorest countries, where information is tightly controlled and the country is engaged in a civil war.Myanmar’s Junta said on Saturday that at least 694 people had been killed and 1,670 others injured. “The death toll and injuries are expected to rise,” the Junta had said on Friday.Photos from the capital, Naypyidaw, showed several government housing buildings destroyed, with rescue workers pulling victims from the debris. Myanmar’s government reported a high demand for blood donations in the worst-affected areas. Images showed cracked and damaged roads in Mandalay, a collapsed bridge, and damage to a dam, raising concerns about how rescue workers would be able to reach certain areas. Myanmar is already facing a humanitarian crisis, making response efforts more challenging.In Bangkok, a 33-story building under construction collapsed near the Chatuchak market. A crane was on top of the structure when it crumpled into a cloud of dust. A video posted on social media showed people screaming and running as the building fell. The sound of sirens filled central Bangkok, and heavy traffic led to gridlocked streets. The elevated rapid transit system and the subway were shut down.While there was no widespread destruction, the shaking brought some dramatic images of rooftop swimming pools sloshing their contents down the side of many of the city's towering apartment blocks and hotels.The area where the earthquake occurred is seismically active, but earthquakes of this size are not common. It is rare for tremors to be felt in Bangkok, which sits on a river delta and has a moderate earthquake risk.In Bangkok, at least three people were killed in the collapse, and 90 others were missing, according to Defense Minister Phumtham Wechayachai. He did not provide further details on the rescue operations, but first responders reported rescuing seven people from the site.At least two of the dead were construction workers who were struck by falling debris, according to rescue worker Songwut Wangpon. The building was being constructed by the China Railway Construction Corporation for Thailand’s government auditor general.Rescue teams were searching through the debris of collapsed buildings on Saturday, trying to find survivors.According to US geologists, it was the strongest earthquake to hit Myanmar in over a century.In the Thai capital, rescuers worked overnight to locate workers trapped under the remains of a 30-story building under construction. The structure collapsed within seconds, leaving behind a heap of rubble and twisted metal due to the force of the quake.Authorities in Bangkok declared the city a disaster area to allow a coordinated response. The metropolitan area has a population of more than 17 million, with many people living in high-rise apartments.India will send more than 15 tonnes of relief materials to Myanmar after a series of strong earthquakes, news agency PTI reported.The relief supplies will be transported on an Indian Air Force (IAF) C-130J aircraft from Air Force Station Hindon.The package includes tents, sleeping bags, blankets, ready-to-eat meals, water purifiers, hygiene kits, solar lamps, generator sets, and essential medicines such as paracetamol, antibiotics, syringes, gloves, and bandages.The US Geological Survey and Germany’s GFZ geosciences center reported that the earthquake was at a depth of 10 kilometers (6.2 miles), according to preliminary findings. Shallower earthquakes tend to cause more destruction.In Mandalay, multiple buildings were damaged, including the Ma Soe Yane monastery, one of the city’s largest, and the former royal palace. A video posted online showed monks in the street filming the monastery just before it collapsed. It was not immediately known if anyone was harmed.In the Sagaing region, southwest of Mandalay, a 90-year-old bridge collapsed. Some sections of the highway linking Mandalay and Myanmar’s largest city, Yangon, were also damaged.Myanmar’s military took power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021. The country is now in a civil war involving long-established armed groups and newly formed pro-democracy forces.Government forces have lost control of many areas in Myanmar, making them difficult or impossible for aid groups to access. The United Nations estimates that more than 3 million people have been displaced due to the fighting, and nearly 20 million people are in need of assistance.The Red Cross reported that downed power lines made it more difficult for their teams to reach some affected locations.Myanmar’s government declared a state of emergency in six regions and states, including Naypyidaw and Mandalay. It was unclear what the declaration would mean since the entire country has been under a state of emergency since 2021.To the northeast, in China, the earthquake was felt in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces. The city of Ruili, which is on the border with Myanmar, experienced damage to houses, and some people were injured, according to Chinese media reports.Videos that one media outlet said came from Ruili showed debris covering a street and a person being transported on a stretcher to an ambulance.The shaking in Mangshi, a city about 100 kilometers (60 miles) northeast of Ruili, was so strong that people could not stand, a resident told The Paper, an online news outlet.","Myanmar's Junta said on Saturday that at least 694 people had been killed and 1,670 others injured.

The group discussed potential strikes against Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen, who have launched multiple missiles towards Israel and attacked shipping in the Red Sea.On March 15, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth sent messages to the principals committee group chat, comprising the highest-ranking National Security Council members, including Cabinet officials and other senior US representatives.According to screenshots of the thread thatpublished, Hegseth wrote:A senior American intelligence official explained to CBS News that ""Trigger Based"" indicates an operation dependent on specific conditions - essentially a decision to proceed with an airstrike based on target confirmation.That day, Navy F/A-18F Super Hornets departed from the aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman in the Red Sea, whilst MQ-9 Reaper drones launched from Middle Eastern bases. US Central Command announced commencing operations with ""precision strikes against Iran-backed Houthi targets across Yemen to restore freedom of navigation.""Before the strike decision, Hegseth expressed support for the action to restore navigation freedom and re-establish deterrence, which he noted had diminished under the Biden administration.After US airstrikes began, Waltz informed Vice President JD Vance via the chat that the building had collapsed and U.S. forces had ""multiple positive ID"" of their intended Houthi targets.Waltz stated: ""The first target — their top missile guy — we had positive ID of him walking into his girlfriend's building and it's now collapsed,"" as reported by The Atlantic.Despite criticism over the Signal chat, senior Trump administration officials maintain the information wasn't classified and no sources or methods were compromised.Waltz posted on X: ""No locations.

A US federal judge on Friday halted the Trump administration 's attempt to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , marking the latest legal setback in the White House's swift push to reshape the federal government.Judge Amy Berman Jackson issued a preliminary injunction to ensure the agency's continuation until she delivers a final verdict on a lawsuit aiming to protect the agency. She stated that judicial action was necessary and essential to prevent the agency's closure.The judge determined that without judicial intervention, the Trump administration would swiftly shut down the agency established by Congress following the 2008 financial crisis, AP news agency reported.Deepak Gupta, attorney representing CFPB workers, welcomed the ruling, stating it halts the unprecedented attempt to dismantle the CFPB and maintains its crucial consumer protection work. ""We're heartened by the decision and look forward to continuing to press our case in court,"" he said in a statement.A March 10 hearing revealed the internal disruption at the agency after staff were instructed to cease work. Adam Martinez, the chief operating officer, described the agency entering ""wind-down mode"" after Trump dismissed Rohit Chopra on February 1.The interim director appointed by Trump halted all operations, terminated £100 million in contracts and dismissed 70 staff members. Martinez noted that current leadership adopted a more systematic approach compared to their initial actions when Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency representatives arrived.The CFPB oversees consumer protection against financial fraud and deceptive practices, handling complaints and monitoring banks to safeguard student loan borrowers.After dismissing the agency's director last month, US President Donald Trump told reporters that the agency should be abolished. On the same day DOGE workers gained access to the CFPB headquarters, Musk posted ""CFPB RIP"" on his social media platform, X.However, once the lawsuit was underway, agency officials walked back some of their earlier positions, asserting in court that they had no intention of dismantling the agency. They also instructed staff to resume certain operations, leading to confusion among employees.""If the defendants are not restrained, they will dismantle the agency before the court has the chance to determine whether the law allows them to do so. As the defendants' own witness warned, the damage will be irreversible,"" Judge Berman Jackson wrote, as per Reuters.In a strongly worded ruling, she dismissed key evidence presented by justice department lawyers, describing some claims as ""a charade for the court's benefit.""","Judge Amy Berman Jackson issued a preliminary injunction to ensure the agency's continuation until she delivers a final verdict on a lawsuit aiming to protect the agency.

Why did Donald Trump pull Elise Stefanik's UN nomination? Here's the answer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-did-donald-trump-pull-elise-stefaniks-un-nomination-heres-the-answer/articleshow/119682006.cms,"Stefanik’s appointment to UN

Fundraising concerns in Florida

Republican frustrations over the decision

Shrinking majority

US President Donald Trump revealed the reason for withdrawing Representative Elise Stefanik ’s nomination as the next US ambassador to the United Nations.He took this decision only to safeguard the Republican majority in the House. Trump acknowledged his party's risky position in Congress, admitting he “didn’t even want to take the chance” of losing Stefanik’s seat in New York’s 21st Congressional district, along with another vacancy in Florida.“We have a few elections going on,” he said—just days after Stefanik had expressed excitement about the UN role on Fox News.A senior White House official stressed the urgency of the decision, telling the New York Post, “Debt ceiling and reconciliation votes are going to be tough already due to Democrats and slim margins, and we can’t make it tougher on ourselves.” Debt ceiling and reconciliation votes are going to be tough already due to Democrats and slim margins, and we can’t make it tougher on ourselves. They added that Stefanik’s seat “would have been vacant for most of the year,” making it a risky move for the GOP.“The American people need and deserve every Republican vote in the House to enact President Trump’s agenda,” the official continued. “We don’t have time to waste.”The Republican-controlled House faces critical votes on major issues, including Trump’s proposed legislation on border security, energy, and taxation—bills that could pass with a simple majority.Government spending measures, however, will likely face strong opposition from Democrats and could also test the unity of fiscal conservatives within the Republican ranks.Stefanik, 40, was selected for the UN post in November and had even tweeted on Monday about her excitement to join Trump’s administration. However, speaking to Hannity on Thursday night, she insisted she had no regrets about the nomination being withdrawn.“This is about stepping up as a team,” she said. “I am doing that as a leader to ensure that we can take hold of this mandate and deliver these historic results.”Trump confirmed on Friday that he pulled her appointment due to the looming special election in her district, as well as the vacancy left by former Florida representative Mike Waltz, who was recently appointed as Trump’s national security adviser.New York Governor Kathy Hochul had also faced hurdles in scheduling a special election for Stefanik’s seat, after clashing with Trump over congestion pricing.Despite his decision, Trump reaffirmed Stefanik’s strong standing in her district, stating, “She’s popular in her district and can’t be beaten.” However, he admitted he was less confident about securing a solid Republican replacement.Another key factor in Trump’s decision was the race to replace Waltz in Florida. Republican candidate Randy Fine is struggling to keep up with Democrat Josh Weil in fundraising, with Weil reportedly securing nearly $9 million in campaign donations compared to Fine’s $987,459, according to Federal Election Commission filings.“You never know what happens in a case like that,” Trump said, expressing concerns over the competitiveness of the race.Trump also acknowledged that Stefanik had done him “a big favour” by remaining in Congress, and house speaker Mike Johnson has promised her a leadership position within the party. However, it remains unclear what that role will be.While some GOP sources supported Trump’s caution, others were left disappointed by the move, arguing that Stefanik was highly qualified and Republicans had a strong chance of retaining her seat.“It plays into the Dem narrative that you’d lose these seats,” one Republican insider said. “It makes everyone look stupid.”Another insider said, “Pulling Stefanik doesn’t make sense.”Trump has yet to announce who will now be nominated for the UN role. Meanwhile, the contests for Waltz’s and former representative Matt Gaetz’s seats in Florida will take place on Tuesday. Gaetz had resigned from Congress after briefly being considered for US attorney general.House speaker Mike Johnson had previously cautioned Trump about the party’s fragile position in the House. At an event with Americans for Prosperity, Johnson recalled a conversation during the White House transition in which he urged Trump to reconsider pulling too many House Republicans into his administration.“Trump began to call the herd,” Johnson said. “So he took a few, and I called him, and I’m like, ‘Mr President, you cannot take any more.’”Johnson said Trump responded, “Oh, Mike, did I do that?”With a slim 218-213 majority over Democrats, the GOP faces an uphill battle in maintaining control of the House.","US President Donald Trump has withdrawn Representative Elise Stefanik’s nomination as the next US ambassador to the United Nations.

Billionaire and close US President Donald Trump ally Elon Musk is facing swift legal action following his promise to give $1 million to two voters in Wisconsin's Supreme Court race. The move is seen as Musk's latest effort to leverage his immense wealth to influence critical US elections.Wisconsin attorney general Josh Kaul announced on Instagram that his office was ""aware of the offer recently posted by Elon Musk"" and confirmed plans to ""take legal action today to seek a court order to stop this from happening.""Musk, the world's richest man and a key advisor to President Donald Trump, has already invested millions to support Republican candidate Brad Schimel. If elected, Schimel would shift Wisconsin's Supreme Court to a conservative majority, a change that could have far-reaching implications in the battleground state.In a post on X, the social media platform he owns, Musk declared that he would ""hand over checks for a million dollars"" to two individuals who sign a petition opposing ""activist judges""—a term frequently used by Republicans to criticise judicial rulings unfavorable to Trump's policies. Additionally, Musk pledged $100 to every person who signs the petition.The Wisconsin Supreme Court is set to rule on crucial issues in the coming term, including abortion access and voting regulations ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Schimel has garnered strong support from Trump, who recently emphasised the significance of the race on his Truth Social platform, calling it ""really big and important.""Musk's offer in Wisconsin mirrors similar high-stakes financial interventions he has made in battleground states during the ongoing presidential election cycle. His growing political involvement comes alongside his companies' extensive government contracts and his influence in Trump's administration, where he has played a role in reducing spending across both foreign and domestic policy sectors.Meanwhile, Tesla—facing declining stock prices amid public backlash against Musk—has recently sued Wisconsin over the state's refusal to grant dealer licenses for its vehicles.","Elon Musk promises to give $1 million to two voters in Wisconsin's Supreme Court race.

Deportation flights

ordered to return

A federal judge in Washington, DC, extended a restraining order preventing the Trump administration from using a centuries-old wartime law to deport Venezuelan nationals accused of gang affiliation , reports Fox news.The order was issued by US district judge James Boasberg on Friday and is set to remain in place until at least April 12.The Trump administration had invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport individuals it claims are members of the Tren de Aragua (TdA), a violent Venezuelan gang. However, Boasberg ruled that more time was needed to assess the legal arguments surrounding its use.In a separate ruling on Friday, a federal judge in Boston also blocked the deportation of migrants to countries with which they have no existing ties unless they are given the chance to contest the move in court.The Trump administration swiftly reacted to Boasberg’s decision, filing an emergency appeal in a higher court. Meanwhile, U.S. Acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris urged the Supreme Court to review the ruling, arguing that it ""limits the administration's ability to protect the Nation against foreign terrorist organizations.""Harris also claimed the lower court's orders were ""flawed"" and could disrupt ""sensitive negotiations"" with foreign governments. She warned of ""serious and perhaps irreparable harm"" if the restraining order remained in place.Boasberg had initially issued a temporary restraining order last week, halting deportations under the Alien Enemies Act and ordering that any planes carrying Venezuelan nationals or other affected deportees be returned.The Trump administration has since asked the Supreme Court to intervene, arguing that the lower courts are interfering with its immigration policies.Additional hearings on the matter are scheduled for April 8, with the Supreme Court also being asked to weigh in on the ongoing dispute. The administration maintains that its actions are necessary for national security, while opponents argue that mass deportations under the Alien Enemies Act could set a dangerous precedent.","A federal judge in Washington, DC, extended a restraining order preventing the Trump administration from using a centuries-old wartime law to deport Venezuelan nationals.

Pakistani YouTube star Rajab Butt has been charged with blasphemy following the launch of his perfume named ""295"", a reference to Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws.The case was filed after his video promoting the fragrance sparked outrage, particularly from the hardline Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), which places blasphemy at the core of its political agenda.Butt, who boasts millions of followers online, announced the perfume in a now-deleted video, referencing Section 295 of Pakistan’s penal code, which deals with blasphemy. The move triggered widespread condemnation, with TLP leader Haider Ali Shah Gillani filing a formal complaint against him on Monday.""There are numerous sections in the penal code, but why did he choose blasphemy-related sections to name a perfume?"" Gillani was quoted by the news agency AFP, accusing Butt of attempting to ""normalise"" disrespect towards religious laws.According to AFP, the police charge sheet confirms that Butt has been charged under both blasphemy and cybercrime laws. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison.As the controversy increased, Butt released an apology video on Sunday, holding a Quran as he sought forgiveness. ""I apologise for the words I uttered during the launch of the perfume,"" he said. He also announced the immediate discontinuation of the product.The controversy also relates to the late Indian rapper Sidhu Moose Wala ’s song ""295,"" which also referenced blasphemy laws. Butt had previously likened himself to Moose Wala, claiming they both faced persecution under similar legal provisions, according to Daily Pakistan.This is not Butt’s first legal battle. In January, he pleaded guilty to illegally owning a lion cub, which he had received as a wedding gift.A Pakistani court ordered him to create 12 educational videos on animal welfare as part of his punishment. He avoided jail time by pledging to use his platform to raise awareness about responsible treatment of wild animals.Blasphemy remains an extremely sensitive issue in Pakistan, where accusations, often unverified, can lead to mob violence and even killings.The legal provisions under Section 295 have been widely criticised by human rights groups for being used as a tool to target individuals, including religious minorities and public figures.","Pakistani YouTube star Rajab Butt has been charged with blasphemy following the launch of his perfume named ""295,"" a reference to Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws.

QUETTA: The Balochistan government , under the leadership of chief minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti , has decided to take stringent measures against government employees involved in anti-state activities , as reported by ARY News.In a high-level meeting chaired by CM Bugti, which was attended by the IG Balochistan and the chief secretary, the government announced that it would target individuals involved in anti-state propaganda and activism.According to ARY News, CM Bugti instructed all commissioners and district officers to act swiftly against any government employees suspected of promoting anti-state narratives or participating in activities that challenge the state's authority. The government's move appears to be a direct attempt to suppress activism and dissent within the province, especially among those critical of the state's policies. Bugti also confirmed that individuals involved in such actions would be placed under strict surveillance by being added to the Fourth Schedule for closer monitoring.ARY News also reported that CM Bugti directed all heads of educational institutions in the province to ensure the national flag is hoisted and the national anthem is recited regularly. Educational leaders who fail to enforce these directives are being told to resign, which signals a heightened crackdown on any form of resistance within these spaces.This renewed focus on stifling activism in Balochistan reflects the government's broader strategy to assert control over the region, including monitoring and potentially silencing any opposition to its policies.This comes amidst the detention of Baloch leaders and activists. Activists in the Balochistan region have frequently organised protests and campaigns, calling attention to the region's marginalisation.In response, governments have implemented harsh crackdowns, often leading to the detention of Baloch leaders and activists. These actions have sparked widespread criticism from international human rights organisations, highlighting concerns over the suppression of political expression and the stifling of peaceful advocacy for regional rights.","The Balochistan government has decided to take stringent measures against government employees involved in anti-state activities.

He has also urged President Donald Trump, through a letter, to ""put pressure on Pakistan’s military leadership including through visa bans, to restore democracy and release Khan.""Khan, ousted in 2022 through a no-confidence vote, was arrested in August 2023 on corruption charges.His supporters claim the charges are politically motivated and backed by the military to block his return to power. Lawmakers from both major US parties have consistently called for his release.Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party members anticipate the Trump administration's intervention for his release. While Trump remains silent on Khan's situation, his ""envoy for special missions,"" Richard Grenell, has expressed support on social media.However, following his removal, Khan consistently blamed Washington for collaborating with Pakistan's opposition to remove him, citing his independent foreign policy and resistance to American influence.His public gatherings featured anti-American rhetoric, presenting his removal as an assault on Pakistani sovereignty. The Biden administration has rejected these allegations.Wilson acknowledged disagreeing with Khan's perspectives but added that such disputes require democratic resolution, stating, ""But political differences should be dealt with at the ballot box,"" he added.The bill requires the US government to identify those involved in political persecution in Pakistan within 180 days and impose penalties, including visa bans and entry restrictions.It specifically accuses General Asim Munir of ""knowingly engaging in the wrongful persecution and imprisonment of political opponents"" and calls for similar action against others.The bill allows for the removal of sanctions if Pakistan ends military rule, restores civilian democracy, and frees all detained political leaders.","Reps.

Challenging the narrative: Why Pakistan is afraid of activist Mahrang Baloch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/challenging-the-narrative-why-pakistan-is-afraid-of-activist-mahrang-baloch-balochistan-province-bla/articleshow/119429476.cms,"Activist Mahrang Baloch (File photo)

Who is Mahrang Baloch?



Growing Baloch resistance



Challenging the narrative



Balochistan, a region rife with conflict, has become a powder keg as Pakistan confronts a growing insurgency and resistance movement, most recently illustrated with the hijacking of a train by the Balochistan Liberation Army.The shock attack resulted in around 60 deaths and brought to fore the boiling deep-seated tensions between the Baloch people and the Pakistani state.Following the attack, senior Pakistan ministers and army leaders held a special meeting to address the country's worsening security crisis.The Pakistan 'establishment', referring to the army, also turned its eyes towards more legitimate forms of protest.Pakistan police recently detained Mahrang Baloch , a leading human rights advocate and symbol of Baloch aspirations, igniting further unrest.Pakistan views the Baloch movement with increasing alarm, fearing the rise of separatist sentiments and challenges to its authority in the region, particularly because of Balochistan's vast area and crucial borders with hostile countries like Iran and Taliban-led Afghanistan.The arrest of nearly 150 activists, including Mahrang Baloch -- recognised by Time Magazine as one of its 100 Next Emerging Leaders -- has sparked international condemnation and raised concerns about human rights abuses and the suppression of Baloch voices in Pakistan.Pakistani authorities arrested Mahrang on Saturday under charges of terrorism, sedition, and murder after a protest in Balochistan's capital, Quetta, resulted in the deaths of three protesters.Mahrang Baloch, a medical doctor and leader of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), has been vocal about enforced disappearances and alleged extrajudicial killings in Balochistan.Her sister, Iqra Baloch, condemned her arrest, stating on social media that her visit to Hudda Jail was reminiscent of when she saw her father behind bars 18 years ago. “Back then, Mahrang was by our side. Today, she is not,” she wrote.Mahrang has been a key figure in protests against enforced disappearances. Her father, Abdul Gaffar Langove, a nationalist leader, was forcibly disappeared in 2009, and his body was found three years later in Lasbela district, according to BBC.Since then, she took the decision to fight against enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings. Now, the 32-year-old is continuing activism despite odds thrown at her, which include death threats, travel bans, detention etc.In December 2023, she helped organise a major march to Islamabad calling for action against enforced disappearances, which was met with police crackdowns.Mahrang's family has also alleged that authorities have denied them permission to meet her in jail or deliver food.Support for the Baloch resistance, both violent and non-violent, has been growing, especially among the youth.Many have been radicalised by ongoing human rights abuses in Balochistan, where an anti-insurgency crackdown — dubbed Pakistan's ""secret dirty war"" — has led to thousands of enforced disappearances and killings over two decades.Voice for Baloch Missing Persons reports that since 2009, around 1,500 missing individuals have been found dead, often brutally tortured, while 6,000 remain missing.Human rights groups say extrajudicial killings are rising, but the military denies involvement.Faith in political solutions has also eroded after allegations of military interference in the 2018 and 2024 elections, which sidelined popular Baloch nationalist leaders.Pakistan has been battling a separatist insurgency in Balochistan for years, with militant groups targeting security forces and foreign nationals.Authorities have often pointed towards the terror activities of the BLA to justify brutal crackdown, arrests and torture of Baloch residents.A major part of the Maharang's movement, however, is based on peaceful advocacy, which observers say presents a challenge to the state's narrative.The province, which is also the poorest, accounts for the lion's share of Pakistan’s total landmass but only 6% of its population, has been a site of insurgency and heavy military presence for decades.Activists claim that Islamabad suppresses political voices while exploiting the region's natural resources.Human rights groups argue that her arrest is part of a broader crackdown on Baloch activists. Protests, often led by women, continue in various parts of Balochistan demanding her release.The Pakistani government has not yet responded to calls for transparency regarding the charges against her.The arrest of Mahrang Baloch has scaled-up scrutiny of Pakistan’s policies in Balochistan, with rights groups calling for an independent investigation into the recent protests and the treatment of activists in the region.","Mahrang Baloch, a medical doctor and leader of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), has been vocal about enforced disappearances and alleged extrajudicial killings in Balochistan.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan 's security forces said 16 militants were killed on Sunday in a remote northwestern border area as they tried to cross the border with neighboring Afghanistan .A military statement said the ""Khwarij,"" a phrase the government uses for Pakistani Taliban, attempted to enter Pakistan from Ghulam Khan , a border town in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.It said Pakistan has long urged Afghanistan to ensure effective border management. Pakistan often accuses the Taliban government in Afghanistan of turning a blind eye to militants operating near the frontier. Kabul denies the charge.The statement said the Afghan government ""is expected to fulfil its obligations and deny the use of Afghan soil"" by militants ""for perpetuating acts of terrorism against Pakistan.""Pakistan has witnessed a surge in militant attacks, most claimed by Pakistani Taliban who are known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan or TTP, and are allies of the Afghan Taliban.TTP is a separate group and has been emboldened since the Afghan Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021. Many TTP leaders and fighters have found sanctuary in Afghanistan since then","16 militants were killed in a remote northwestern border area as they tried to cross the border with neighboring Afghanistan.

SRINAGAR: The bodies of a young Kashmiri man and woman who jumped into the Jhelum near the LoC in Uri on March 5 were returned to their families Saturday after being retrieved from separate spots in the river in PoK. The handover took place at Kaman Post bridge, a crossing point originally built for trade and travel between the two sides of Kashmir.The bridge was opened for the first time since India suspended cross-LoC trade and travel in April 2019, citing concerns that the route was being misused by “Pakistan-based elements for funnelling weapons, narcotics, and fake money”.Though J&K police and disaster response teams had searched extensively, the bodies were found weeks later in PoK — 19-year-old Asiya Bano’s on March 19 and 22-year-old Yassir Hussain Shah’s on March 21. It wasn’t clear why the two natives of Uri in Baramulla district jumped into the Jhelum, which flows from J&K to Pakistan and joins the Chenub, a tributary of the Indus.Following a formal request from India, Pakistani authorities agreed to return the bodies. Senior civil and military officers from both countries, along with medical teams, facilitated the transfer at Kaman Post, about 115km east of Srinagar.“This was a humanitarian effort taken by both nations,” said NC legislator Sajjad Shafi from Uri. “The return of the bodies provides much-needed closure and relief to grieving loved ones.”","The bodies of a young Kashmiri man and woman who jumped into the Jhelum near the LoC in Uri on March 5 were returned to their families Saturday after being retrieved from separate spots in the river in PoK.
