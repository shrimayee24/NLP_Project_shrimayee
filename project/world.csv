South Africa Land Confiscation: Trump Cuts Funding Over Human Rights Concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/south-africa-is-confiscating-land-treating-people-very-badly-donald-trump-announces-halt-on-us-funding/articleshow/117871498.cms,"File photo: US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)

US President Donald Trump announced on Sunday that he would cut off all future funding to South Africa, citing allegations that the government was confiscating land and treating certain classes of people “very badly”.Trump made the announcement in a Truth Social post, stating, “South Africa is confiscating land, and treating certain classes of people very badly. The United States won’t stand for it, we will act. Also, I will be cutting off all future funding to South Africa until a full investigation of this situation has been completed!”.According to US government statistics, the United States allocated nearly $440 million in assistance to South Africa in 2023, covering health programs, economic development, and security cooperation, as per the news agency Reuters.Trump’s decision means future funding will be suspended while his administration looks into alleged human rights violations.The controversy stems from South African President Cyril Ramaphosa ’s recent signing of a land expropriation bill, which allows the government to offer “nil compensation” for property in cases where expropriation is deemed in the public interest.However, the South African government insists that this does not equate to arbitrary seizures and that it will negotiate with landowners first, as per AFP.While land reform remains a sensitive issue in post-apartheid South Africa, critics, including billionaire Elon Musk, a Trump ally and South African-born entrepreneur, have warned that the policy could resemble Zimbabwe’s land seizures of the 1980s, which led to economic collapse.Despite Trump’s move, Ramaphosa has dismissed concerns over relations with Washington. In January, he stated that he had spoken to Trump after his election victory and looked forward to working with his administration.However, the South African government has not yet formally responded to the funding freeze.Trump had previously pledged to investigate alleged violent land takeovers and killings of white farmers in South Africa during his first term, though no evidence of large-scale incidents was found, according to Reuters.The funding cut comes amid Trump’s broader “America First” foreign policy, which has seen him reduce aid to several nations and focus on domestic priorities.","US President Donald Trump announced on Sunday that he would cut off all future funding to South Africa.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday launched a scathing attack on Rahul Gandhi accusing the Congress leader of speaking the language of urban Naxals. The Prime Minister also took pot shots at Rahul over his allegations of ""EAM lobbying for Trump inauguration invite"" and his ""boring"" remark for President Droupadi Murmu's Budget speech ""Today some people are openly speaking the language of urban naxals. The things that urban naxals say (are being said). These people who speak the language of urban naxals, who declare war against the Indian State, can neither understand the Constitution nor about the country's unity,"" Modi said.""Those who walk around with pockets in Constitution, do they know how they forced Muslim women to live in hardship. We brought in the triple talaq law to give right to them,"" he said and added: ""We live by spirit of Constitution and do not resort to politics of poison.""Though the Prime Minister did not name anyone, his remarks were an apparent reference to Rahul's comments last month that ""we are now fighting the BJP, the RSS and the Indian State itself"".The Prime Minister also countered Rahul Gandhi's attacks on the government over neglect of the OBCs. ""For some people, speaking about caste is fashion. For the last 30 years, OBC MPs have been demanding that OBC Commission be granted Constitutional status. Those who see a benefit in casteism today did not think of the OBC community back then. We granted Constitutional status to the OBC Commission. SC, ST and OBC get more opportunities in every sector - we have worked very strongly towards this,"" the PM said training his guns at Rahul who has relentlessly accused the government of neglecting the OBCs.The Prime Minister then went on to take an indirect swipe at the Gandhi family, which has three MPs - Sonia, Rahul and Priyanka.""I pose an important question to the citizens through this House - have there ever been three MPs simultaneously from the same family of SC community? I also ask, tell me if there ever were three MPs simultaneously from the same family belonging to the ST community ... "" the PM said. He then went on to assert that there was a vast difference between the opposition's words and actions.Targeting Rahul Gandhi's allegations of external affairs minister lobbying for Trump inauguration invite, the Prime Minister took a dig at the Congress leader. 'Some think talking about foreign policy is maturity. They feel they are not mature enough if they don't talk about foreign policy, even at the cost of the nation,"" the Prime Minister said.""If they are really interested in foreign policy, they should read the book 'JFK's Forgotten Crises' that talks of Pandit Nehru's meetings with John F Kennedy to learn about foreign policy,"" he said and added: ""The book speaks of happenings in name of foreign policy when country was facing many challenges.""

He said that, ""Both the parties (Congress, SP) and anti- Sanatan forces wanted a major incident to take place.""His remarks came amid opposition allegations that the Uttar Pradesh government was underreporting the casualties from the Maha Kumbh stampede .Adityanath, addressing the claims against Maha Kumbh said, “New records of lies and falsehood are being made by elements taking a contract against Sanatan Dharma. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav's statements in Parliament are drawing everyone's attention towards it. Both these statements reflect not only their anti-Sanatana face but also draw everyone's attention towards their hawk eye that is continuously spreading disinformation against Maha Kumbh from the first day.”UP CM said, ""Both parties and the anti-Sanatan forces wanted a major incident to happen. Our priority was to ensure that this event remained incident-free, but the incident that did occur is unfortunate. (Yeh dono dal chahte the, aur sanatan virodhi chahte the ki bada haadsa ho jae. humari prathmikta thi ki hum iss karyakrm ko zero hadse tak le jae, lekin jo ghatna ghati hui toh dukhad hai.)""The controversy erupted after Mallikarjun Kharge, speaking in Rajya Sabha on Monday, claimed that 1,000 people had died in the stampede, while the UP government maintained that the death toll stood at 30. Meanwhile, Akhilesh Yadav also questioned the official figures and demanded that the government release the exact number of casualties.Rejecting the opposition’s allegations, Adityanath accused them of attempting to discredit the Maha Kumbh event. “On one hand, the people are witnessing such a big event and taking part in it with pride, and on the other hand, Sanatan Dharm ke khilaf supari lekarke shadyantra, repeatedly there are malicious acts being plotted too,"" he said.The chief minister defended the administration’s handling of the incident, stating that security forces acted promptly to ensure the injured received medical attention. ""Saying that no numbers (on deaths) were given. I had personally put the numbers in front of everyone, everyone was sad. The way officials had a quick response, NDRF, SDRF, civil defence, police, all of them worked to bring the injured to the hospital is an example of good work done,"" the CM added.Adityanath also dismissed Kharge’s remarks as misleading. ""Congress president says that thousands of people died in Prayagraj on Mauni Amavasya. We feel sad, it is not expected of such a senior leader and president of the oldest party to make such controversial statements in the Parliament and mislead. SP chief made a similar statement. There is competition between both parties, who can be more anti-Sanatana,"" he said.Meanwhile, Akhilesh Yadav reiterated his demand for transparency. “Why is the govt not giving the figures of the deceased in the stampede?... If there was a huge gathering at that time, why was space not given in the Army premises? The Government allowed this incident to take place. Now, they do not want to give the details and if anyone tries to provide details, FIR will be registered against them,” he alleged.The stampede occurred during the second Shahi Snan on Mauni Amavasya at the Maha Kumbh Mela. According to the Uttar Pradesh government, at least 30 people were killed and around 60 sustained injuries. The incident has sparked a political row, with opposition leaders questioning the handling of the tragedy and the official figures released by the state government.",Yogi Adityanath accuses Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav of conspiring against Sanatan Dharma.

They said that ten bills were sent to the governor after reconsideration by the assembly but he did not give approval.Singhvi said that as per Art 200, a governor can grant assent or refer it to President or send it for reconsideration but when it is sent again after reconsideration, then governor is left with no option but to approve the bill. He said that the present governor is making a mockery of Art 200 and pleaded the court to intervene to settle the controversy.

"Abujmarh has fallen, no longer a Red citadel, says surrendered top Maoist",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/abujmarh-has-fallen-no-longer-a-red-citadel-says-surrendered-top-maoist/articleshow/117928752.cms,"GADCHIROLI : The once-unassailable Maoist headquarters in Abujmarh - spread across the rugged, forested hills straddling Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh - has fallen to security forces after 50 years of bloodshed. A fact conceded by Giridhar, a former commander of PLGA, during a conversation with TOI Tuesday.""Abujmarh is no longer an impregnable Red citadel. The liberated zones have been smashed, commandos are conquering every inch of Dandakaranya jungles. Maoist cadre base has been practically wiped out,"" said the guerrilla combat strategist, who surrendered in June last year and now resides at Gadchiroli police HQ with his wife Sangita.Giridhar, who once helmed seven dalams in Gadchiroli for 28 years, saw the movement decline first-hand. ""There was a spark, a vision, and an ideology. But in today's world, change can only be ushered through democracy. Why should one tribal kill another - one in uniform, the other a Naxal? Meaningless killings find no place in history,"" he said.Once a key architect of Maoist expansion, Giridhar had masterminded the 2009 ambush that killed Rajnandgaon SP Vinod Choubey. With 185 cases against him, he was instrumental in shoehorning villagers into the guerrilla force, even as younger generations drifted toward urban aspirations.""Our cadre base was fast depleting. Police seemed friendlier with their civic actions, freebies, jobs, and promise of a better life. With education and the lure of urban dazzle, nobody wanted to join us. The youth did not want to die with a police bullet in their head,"" he said.Giridhar's surrender turned the wheels of Maharashtra's anti-Maoist operations, leading to the elimination of senior members like Milind Teltumbde, Rupesh, and Bhaskar Hichami. His exit was followed by over 30 cadres returning to the mainstream.Maoists' undoing was a dovetailing of police aggression and govt outreach. ""After Union minister Amit Shah's call to wipe us out by 2026, we knew our days were numbered. Security forces' nightly operations, cordons, and carpet bombings left us clueless,"" added Giridhar, who narrowly escaped death twice.While Maoism in Gadchiroli is gasping for air, top leaders like Hidma, Bhupathi alias Sonu, and Prabhakar - the current Gadchiroli Maoist chief - are continuing to hold out. Giridhar cautioned against writing its obituary just yet. ""The ideology may again revive with one good leader rising up against displacement, exploitation, ostracism, and suppression. Don't take any situation for granted.""",Maoists' undoing was a dovetailing of police aggression and govt outreach. Giridhar masterminded the 2009 ambush that killed Rajnandgaon SP Vinod Choubey.

Many countries became developed in 20-25 years and since we have democracy, demography and demand, we have to move on with this dream till 2047.""Rahul had Monday alleged that Modi sent external affairs minister S Jaishankar to the US to wangle an invite for inauguration of Donald Trump as US president as part of his larger narrative of incompetence against Modi govt. The PM did not respond to the specific charge which Jaishankar had already refuted but referred to J K Galbraith's recollection of first PM Jawaharlal Nehru's visit to the US during John F Kennedy's presidency, terming it as the ""worst state visit"".Galbraith was a close aide of former US president JFK and a renowned public servant who served as ambassador to India.""These days, people seek to talk about foreign policy. That is seen as a sign of maturity. Such people should read 'JFK's Forgotten Crisis: Tibet, the CIA and the Sino-Indian War'. Only then will you get to know what transpired under the cloak of diplomacy,"" Modi said, referring to details of Galbraith's unflattering account of Nehru's engagements in Washington DC as told to former US diplomat and CIA analyst Bruce Riedel.It was one of Modi's least-interrupted speeches in recent times in Lok Sabha as the entire opposition was in attendance and the speech concluded without any noticeable protests or objections by opposition parties.Modi, however, deployed his trademark blend of aggression and subtlety. He suggested that Rahul's claim to be a custodian of the interests of SCs/STs and OBCs did not square with the entitlements that came with his elite background. ""How many SCs/STs and OBCs have had three members simultaneously serving as MPs?"" he asked, alluding to Sonia and Priyanka also being MPs. He criticised Sonia for her ""poor thing"" remark about Murmu. ""After the President's address - a woman President, the daughter of a poor family - if you cannot respect her, it is up to you. But what all is being said to insult her? What is the reason?"" he said.The PM once again took on the allegation that BJP under him was out to subvert the Constitution. ""There are some people who are strutting around with copies of the Constitution stuffed in their pockets. But we are the ones who have internalised the Constitution and act accordingly,"" he said.In a not-so-veiled allusion to Congress' recent pitch for caste census, he said ""it has become a fashion for some leaders to talk of castes"".Modi invoked his own humble background to assert that when a person, who is connected to the ground, understands the ground reality and spends his life for the poor, then changes follow.""One who has lived that kind of life knows what it means to have a house with a proper roof. Pain of poor, troubles of common man cannot be understood just like that; it requires passion and some just don't have it,"" he said.","PM Modi accuses Rahul Gandhi of using ""the language of urban Naxals openly"" He also took exception to Rahul's remark terming Droupadi Murmu's speech unexciting.

A US C-17 military aircraft departed from San Antonio, Texas, and is en route to Amritsar with 205 unauthorised Indian immigrants on board, according to reports. The flight is expected to arrive at Sri Guru Ram Das Ji International Airport on Wednesday.Punjab DGP Gaurav Yadav said the state govt will receive the deportees belonging to Punjab in a ""friendly"" manner and will ""set up counters for them"". He was responding to a question during a press conference on deportation of illegal immigrants by the US after attending a high-level meeting chaired by Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann to review law and order in the state. He said the issue (of the US military plane landing with illegal immigrants at Amritsar airport) was discussed at the meeting. ""We are in touch with the govt. We will share the information as and when it comes,"" DGP Yadav added.Another senior Punjab police officer said, ""Anyone who is wanted by us and against whom a lookout circular has been issued will be arrested at the airport itself by the central agencies. We are yet to get the list of who all are arriving. Once we get the list, we can check the criminal antecedents, if any, and act as required. But right now there is no such indication that they are sending any hardcore criminals. Those arriving probably are the ones who went there for bread and butter. So, essentially we will treat them humanely.""The deportees belong to Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh, according to a Punjab govt functionary. There were ""around 30 persons hailing from Punjab"" and the ""maximum"" from Haryana, slightly higher than Punjab, the person added.Another functionary said there would be around 100 illegal immigrants in total who would arrive in the US plane.The functionary said the Punjab govt would ""arrange for the transportation"" of those belonging to Punjab, and that other state govts would do so for the illegal immigrants from their states. The deportees will undergo a thorough immigration process on landing in Amritsar the functionary said, adding that police verification of the illegal immigrants ""is being handled by the ministry of external affairs"".A senior Punjab police officer said central agencies would be looking into the aspects of criminal antecedents, if any, ""as it will be their domain"".""We will assess their records, including any involvement in criminal activity. Only after these checks are completed, and we are satisfied, will the deportees be allowed to exit the airport. This process aims to ensure that all legal and security protocols are strictly followed,"" a senior officer at Amritsar airport said on condition of anonymity, adding that after completion of formalities the deported Indians would be allowed to go to their homes.Relatives of the deported Indians are expected to gather at the airport to receive them. However, sources revealed that even the families of the people being deported are not aware of the exact arrival details. ""This lack of communication has raised concern about potential confusion or chaos at the airport, but we expect a smooth operation despite uncertainties,"" said an official involved in the process, adding that while there could be some disruptions, they have made all necessary arrangements.This flight is part of the crackdown launched by the US govt after President Donald Trump started his second term. It is expected that more illegal immigrants from India will be deported on similar flights.The US govt has not released any details on the current number of illegal Indian immigrants in that country. Pew Research, in its 2019-2022 report on unauthorised immigrants living in the US, has put India as the third highest contributor of illegals who live in the US, at 725,000, behind El Salvador (750,000) and Mexico (4 million). However, the US department of homeland security in its latest report pegged the number of illegal Indian immigrants at 220,000 in 2022, down from 480,000 in 2018.They should not have been deported: Punjab NRI affairs ministerPunjab NRI affairs minister Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal expressed disappointment over the US decision to deport these people, saying they have contributed to the US economy and should have been granted permanent residency instead of being deported.Many people from Punjab had entered the US through the ""donkey route"" or by other illegal means by spending lakhs of rupees and are now facing deportation, Dhaliwal said, describing the issue as ""very serious"".

US sends back illegal Indian migrants in military aircraft,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-sends-back-illegal-indian-migrants-in-military-aircraft/articleshow/117925897.cms,"NEW DELHI: In the first such operation of its kind involving India since the return of Donald Trump to the White House, the US despatched a C17 military aircraft carrying an unspecified number of illegal Indian migrants to India. Anonymous US officials were quoted as saying dozens had been deported, and unconfirmed reports put the number of deportees north of 200, but there was no confirmation about the same by either country.In fact, there was no official acknowledgement at all of the flight by Indian authorities till late in the evening. The American embassy here, without sharing any details about the flight, said the US is vigorously enforcing its border, tightening immigration laws, and removing illegal migrants. “These actions send a clear message: illegal migration is not worth the risk,” said the spokesperson.Official sources here said India’s position on illegal migration had not changed and it will continue to accept those who illegally entered the US, after verifying their Indian origin. The people who are returning, all verified Indian nationals, are among the thousands of Indians identified for deportation under the Biden administration.An early morning report by Reuters from Washington said the C-17 aircraft had departed for India with migrants aboard but would not arrive for at least 24 hours. The Punjab government was preparing for its landing in Amritsar on Wednesday morning. The Indian government did not confirm if the plane was going to land there but American journalists quoted US officials as saying that the aircraft was on its way to the Indian border city after a stop in Guam.The development also comes days ahead of PM Narendra Modi’s visit to the US for his first bilateral meeting with Trump since the latter’s inauguration on January 20. Trump had raised the issue of illegal migration with Modi and later said the India PM would do what’s right on the issue.While India has been accepting illegal migrants from the US for years, including under the first Trump administration, it has rarely, if ever, used a military aircraft to deport Indian nationals to India. The last time US authorities deported a significant number of illegals to India was in October last year but that was carried out through a large frame charter flight. Colombia recently turned away 2 US military deportation aircraft, saying the US was treating its nationals like criminals, but quickly backed down after Trump threatened to retaliate with punitive trade tariffs.While India is unlikely to be as sensitive as some of the Leftist Latin American leaders about receiving citizens in a military aircraft from the US, a country it has robust defence cooperation with, the Indian government will closely follow how Indian nationals returning are handled by American authorities in deportation flights. This is also the farthest that a US deportation plane has travelled since Trump’s return as such flights were limited till now to central and South American countries. Many of these illegal migrants were reported to have landed in their respective countries in handcuffs. While Mexico has insisted on accepting its citizens only in civilian planes, Brazil complained about “flagrant disregard’’ of human rights in US deportation flights.A New York Times report on January 3, quoting defence officials, said military planes have rarely been used in the past by the US for deportation. Most deportations in the past couple of weeks have been through nonmilitary planes and only 6 military flights have been used for the same till the end of Trump’s second week in office. Guatemala, Honduras, Ecuador and Peru are the only countries to have received military flights till the end of the last week.","The US despatched a C17 military aircraft carrying an unspecified number of illegal Indian migrants to India. Anonymous US officials were quoted as saying dozens had been deported, and unconfirmed reports put the number of deportees north of 200. Official sources here said India’s position on illegal migration had not changed and it will continue to accept those who illegally entered the US.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117932900,imgsize-1237229,width-400,resizemode-4/117932900.jpg"

Donald Trump’s Super Bowl LIX Attendance Marks Historic First for a Sitting U.S. President



Donald Trump’s Sports Connection and Super Bowl Pregame Interview



There will be many celebrities. Many moments when reigning champion Kansas City Chiefs will face Philadelphia Eagles on February 9 in New Orleans in a Super Bowl 57 rematch. But will President Donald Trump be there? We know Mr. Trumps' love for the game and what he keeps saying about changing some rules, but given the fact that there was an attack on New Year, people has the question regarding his attendance. Meanwhile, the White House has its say on the matter.The upcoming Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans is set to be a spectacle, not just for football fans but also on the political stage, as former President Donald Trump is set to attend the game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles. A White House official, speaking anonymously, confirmed Trump's plans to the Associated Press and this visit will mark a historic milestone, as Trump will become the first sitting U.S. president to ever attend a Super Bowl.While presidents have traditionally steered clear of attending the game in person, vice presidents have made appearances in the past. Al Gore watched the Cowboys defeat the Bills in 1994, George H.W. Bush attended in 1982 when the 49ers beat the Bengals, and Spiro Agnew witnessed the Colts' 1971 win over the Cowboys. However, Trump’s presence at the Caesars Superdome will bring an unprecedented level of security, especially following the tragic terror attack on Bourbon Street earlier this year.The Super Bowl is already classified as a National Special Security Event (NSSE), which requires a full-scale, multi-agency security strategy. With Trump’s attendance, security efforts will be further intensified, with additional personnel from federal, state, and local law enforcement. More than 2,700 officers had already been scheduled for deployment, but officials anticipate even tighter measures. Despite the increased security presence, officials reassured the public that there are no credible threats to the event. ""Right now we have no specific credible threats to this event ... which I think should give us all a sense of security,"" stated Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.Trump, who often speaks about his interest in sports, has not explicitly revealed his preference between the Chiefs and the Eagles. However, he hinted at his admiration for Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, stating, “I don’t want to say, but there’s a certain quarterback that seems to be a pretty good winner.” His connection to the Chiefs runs deeper, as he previously acknowledged the public support he has received from members of the organization, celebrating their AFC Championship win by posting, “Congratulations to the Kansas City Chiefs... What a GREAT Team, Coach, Quarterback, and virtually everything else, including those fantastic FANS, that voted for me (MAGA!) in record numbers.”Aside from attending the game, Trump will also be featured in a pre-recorded interview with Fox News’ Bret Baier, set to air at 3 p.m. ET. This marks the first time in three years that a U.S. president has agreed to a pregame Super Bowl interview, after President Joe Biden declined to do so in 2023 and 2024.Also Read: Taylor Swift to attend Super Bowl LIX for Travis Kelce after Chiefs star missed her Grammy night With the high-profile nature of the event, star power won’t be limited to the football field. Music icon Kendrick Lamar is set to perform during the halftime show, while pop sensation Taylor Swift, the girlfriend of Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, is also expected to be in attendance, making Super Bowl LIX an unforgettable night of sports, politics, and entertainment.",Former President Donald Trump is set to attend Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans.

At least ten people shot dead at adult education center in Sweden's Orebro,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/five-people-shot-at-school-adult-education-center-in-swedens-orebro/articleshow/117919152.cms,"At least ten people, including the gunman, were killed in a mass shooting at an adult education center in the central Swedish city of Orebro on Tuesday, police said.Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson called the attack the country's “worst mass shooting” during a news conference held hours after the incident.""This is the worst mass shooting in Swedish history. Many questions remain unanswered, and I cannot provide those answers either. But the time will come when we will know what happened, how it could occur, and what motives may have been behind it. Let us not speculate,"" he added.According to Swedish police, ""Around 10 dead in Sweden school shooting,"" prompting a large-scale police operation. Authorities have urged the public to avoid the area.""There has been a shooting at the school. Four people have been shot. The extent of the injuries is unclear. The operation is ongoing,"" police initially said in a statement. Minutes later, they updated that a fifth person had been shot.Images from the scene showed a heavy police presence, with multiple ambulances and emergency vehicles outside the school. The adult education centre is about 200 km (125 miles) west of Stockholm.Several media outlets reported that the suspected assailant had turned the gun on himself. While police did not confirm this, they stated that five people had been injured by gunfire, including one believed to be the shooter.“One of the injured persons is a person whom we suspect may be the assailant,” Orebro police chief Roberto Eid Forest said at a press conference.“We can't rule out other suspects, and that's something we are continuing to work on in this intensive phase now – why it happened and if there are other possible suspects.”Forest added that police received the first reports of a school shooting at 12:33 pm (1133 GMT) but could not confirm how the attack unfolded or whether it occurred inside or outside the school.Two Campus Risbergska teachers, Miriam Jarlevall and Patrik Söderman, told Dagens Nyheter:“Students came and said someone was shooting. Then we heard more shooting in the hallway. We didn't go out, we hid in our offices.”“There were a lot of gunshots at first and then it was quiet for a half-hour and then it started again. We were lying under our desks, cowering.”Some witnesses told Swedish media they heard what sounded like automatic gunfire.Meanwhile, Swedish TV channel TV4 reported that police raided the suspect’s home in Orebro late on Tuesday afternoon.The suspect was reportedly around 35 years old, had a licence to carry a weapon, and had no criminal record. However, further details about his identity were not disclosed.","At least ten people, including the gunman, were killed in a mass shooting at an adult education center in the central Swedish city of Orebro.

Senate committee pushes through RFK's nomination,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/senate-committee-pushes-through-rfks-nomination/articleshow/117934169.cms,"WASHINGTON: The Senate finance committee voted Tuesday to forward the nomination of Robert F Kennedy Jr to the full Senate, setting up a vote on whether Kennedy, one of the nation's most vociferous critics of vaccines, should become the nation's next health secretary.Senator Bill Cassidy , R-La., a physician who has been on the fence about Kennedy, cast the deciding vote, after days of publicly agonizing over what to do. The final tally was split along party lines: 14 Republicans voted yes, and all 13 Democrats opposed him.Shortly before casting his vote in favour of advancing Kennedy, Cassidy said in a statement that he had received ""serious commitments"" from the Trump administration in exchange for his support. Cassidy said he was engaged in intense conversations with Kennedy and the White House since his confirmation hearing. For Cassidy, voting against Kennedy - and defying Trump - would have been a politically perilous step. He is up for reelection in 2026 and is already facing a primary challenge from the right.On Monday, Cassidy said he and Kennedy had a ""cordial"" conversation over the weekend, but that he was ""still working through"" how he would vote. During last week's confirmation hearing before the health committee, Cassidy delivered impassioned, anguished remarks expressing his reservations. ""I've been struggling with your nomination,"" Cassidy said after Kennedy repeatedly refused to disavow his past criticism of vaccines. nyt","Senator Bill Cassidy cast the deciding vote, after days of publicly agonizing over what to do.

'Beautiful voice but can’t understand a word': Donald Trump to reporter on Afghanistan question,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/beautiful-voice-but-cant-understand-a-word-donald-trump-to-reporter-on-afghanistan-question/articleshow/117934158.cms,"US President Donald Trump once again waded into the debate over America’s withdrawal from Afghanistan, offering a mix of frustration and defiance in his comments. When asked by a reporter about the country’s ongoing struggles and the role of the Taliban, Trump claimed that he could not understand her, but offered his take: “It’s a beautiful voice and a beautiful accent. The only problem is I can’t understand a word you're saying, but... Good luck. Live in peace.”Trump’s remarks came amid broader discussions about US foreign policy in the Middle East, especially concerning the Taliban's resurgence after America’s chaotic withdrawal in 2021. The US retreat, a key point of contention in Trump’s political rhetoric, was labelled by him as “the most embarrassing day” in the country’s history.Speaking at a press conference alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump also proposed that the United States take “ownership” of Gaza and redevelop the area into “the Riviera of the Middle East.”“I believe the US will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it too,” Trump stated, outlining his vision for turning the war-torn region into a desirable destination. “It’ll be wonderful for the people — Palestinians mostly,” he added, indicating that the US would take responsibility for both the redevelopment and the relocation of its current inhabitants.Trump’s proposal comes amidst fragile ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas and a growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Despite widespread criticism, including from key allies in the Middle East like Egypt and Jordan, Trump insists that the Palestinians have no choice but to leave what he described as a “big pile of rubble.”During his time in office, Trump had initiated peace talks with the Taliban, aiming for a strategic exit. However, he cancelled a planned meeting at Camp David in 2019 after a Taliban attack killed a US soldier. This move led to the collapse of talks, with Trump emphasising that the Taliban had “ruined” the possibility of peace through violence. Trump had repeatedly insisted that the US would leave Afghanistan on its terms, ensuring a withdrawal that would secure American interests.In the aftermath of the Taliban’s takeover, Trump has been vocal about his belief that the US should have had a stronger hand in the region, even considering a more direct involvement to reshape Afghanistan.","US President Donald Trump offered a mix of frustration and defiance in his comments.

BREAKING: Pam Bondi confirmed as US attorney general

The US Senate confirmed Pam Bondi as attorney general on Tuesday evening. Bondi, a longtime ally of American President Donald Trump, will lead the Justice Department following the removal of career employees seen as disloyal to the Republican administration.The confirmation vote was mostly along party lines, with only one Democrat, Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, joining all Republicans to approve her nomination in a 54-46 vote.Republicans have supported Bondi, saying she will refocus the Justice Department on its main responsibilities.“Pam Bondi has promised to get the department back to its core mission: prosecuting crime and protecting Americans from threats to their safety and their freedoms,” said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.Bondi, a former Florida attorney general and corporate lobbyist, is expected to oversee major changes in the department, which had pursued criminal cases against Trump. She will also oversee the FBI , which has been under scrutiny due to its role in investigations related to Trump.Bondi’s close ties to Trump have raised concerns among Democrats. Trump previously removed an FBI director who refused to pledge loyalty and replaced an attorney general who recused himself from the Russia investigation.At her confirmation hearing, Bondi assured lawmakers that politics would not influence her decisions but did not rule out investigations into Trump’s political opponents. She also repeated Trump’s claim that the Justice Department had been used unfairly against him.Senator Peter Welch, D-Vt., acknowledged Bondi’s qualifications but expressed concern about Trump’s expectations.“That clearly is a loyalty oath to him as opposed to a demand for straightforward, candid advice, including if the president is asking for something to be done like the prosecution of a political adversary,” Welch said.The confirmation vote took place hours after FBI agents sued the Justice Department over efforts to identify employees involved in the January 6 prosecutions. The agents fear this could lead to mass firings.At her confirmation hearing, Bondi said that she would not pursue cases for political reasons and that her duty was to the public, not the president. However, some of her comments were similar to Trump’s views on the justice system.“They targeted Donald Trump,” Bondi told lawmakers. “They went after him—actually starting back in 2016, they targeted his campaign. They have launched countless investigations against him.” She added, “If I am attorney general, I will not politicize that office.”Trump nominated Bondi after former Representative Matt Gaetz failed to secure enough Republican support for confirmation.Bondi has been a strong public defender of Trump and previously suggested that Justice Department prosecutors would be investigated under his administration.“The investigators will be investigated,” she said in a 2023 Fox News appearance.","Pam Bondi, a longtime ally of American President Donald Trump, will lead the Justice Department.

Trump says he left 'instructions' for Iran to be 'obliterated' if it assassinates him

US President Donald Trump reinstated his ""maximum pressure"" campaign on Iran on Tuesday, using a visit from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to announce new economic measures aimed at pressuring Iran into concessions, including giving up its nuclear program.The White House did not immediately release details of the executive order, so its exact terms remain unclear. Trump, who has previously expressed interest in negotiations with Iran, said he was hesitant to sign it.""So this is one I'm torn about,"" he told reporters. ""Everyone wants me to sign it. I'll do that."" He added, ""We have to be strong and firm, and I hope that it's not going to have to be used in any great measure at all.""Trump suggested Iran could negotiate a new agreement, which would likely include restrictions on its support for groups like Hezbollah and Hamas.Trump also said he has given his advisers instructions to respond forcefully if Iran assassinates him.""If they did that, they would be obliterated,"" Trump said while signing the executive order. ""I’ve left instructions if they do it, they get obliterated, there won’t be anything left.""Federal authorities have been tracking Iranian threats against Trump and other administration officials for years.In 2020, Trump ordered the killing of Qassem Soleimani , who led the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ Quds Force.It is uncertain if the new pressure campaign will succeed. Trump also pursued maximum pressure in 2018 after withdrawing the US from the nuclear deal Iran had signed with the Obama administration in 2015. While Trump considers that decision a success, many analysts argue it had the opposite effect. European countries did not support the approach, and Iran eventually left the agreement, advancing its nuclear program.In recent years, Iran has resumed large-scale uranium enrichment. Inspectors and experts estimate that Iran now has enough uranium, enriched just below bomb-grade, to produce at least four weapons.Trump's executive order on Tuesday included measures to block Iranian oil shipments, many of which go to China. China has not followed US sanctions, and Trump has accused President Joe Biden of allowing Iran to bypass existing restrictions.","US President Donald Trump reinstated his ""maximum pressure"" campaign on Iran on Tuesday.

Santorini earthquakes: Greek island Santorini on alert after seismic activity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/over-200-undersea-earthquakes-hit-greeces-santorini-authorities-on-high-alert/articleshow/117883527.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)

Authorities have stepped up precautions on the volcanic island of Santorini, Greece, following a spike in seismic activity that has raised concerns about a potentially powerful earthquake. As of Monday, more than 200 undersea earthquakes were recorded over the past three days in the Aegean Sea, prompting the government to close schools and send emergency crews to the island.Several nearby islands, including Amorgos, Anafi, and Ios, have also been affected, with schools closed and evacuation protocols in place for residents. Authorities are urging residents to remain vigilant and adhere to safety measures to minimize risk.The earthquakes, with magnitudes up to 4.8, have been ongoing, with the strongest occurring on Sunday afternoon between Santorini and the nearby island of Amorgos, measuring 4.6 in magnitude, as reported by AFP.While experts state the tremors are not related to Santorini’s volcano, the frequency and intensity of the quakes have left residents anxious. Local resident Michalis Gerontakis, director of the Santorini Philharmonic Orchestra, expressed his concern, noting that while the orchestra performed amid the quakes, the constant shaking made the community uneasy. “You cannot contend with nature,” Gerontakis remarked, as quoted by AP.Despite the fear among locals, experts such as Efthymios Lekkas, president of the Organisation of Antiseismic Planning and Protection, have reassured that while a 5.5 magnitude quake could be possible, a quake above magnitude six is not expected.However, Gerasimos Papadopoulos, a prominent Greek seismologist, cautioned that the current earthquake sequence could indicate the potential for a larger event, especially as the tremors continue to intensify and shift toward the northeast.In response to the ongoing seismic threat, authorities have advised Santorini's residents and visitors to avoid large indoor gatherings and steer clear of areas prone to rock slides, such as certain ports and swimming pools.Emergency teams, including firefighters and rescue personnel, have been dispatched to assist, with temporary shelters set up for displaced families.As the potential danger looms, some locals opted to sleep outdoors or leave the island by ferry and plane in response to the tremors.Santorini, a major tourist destination known for its stunning views and whitewashed villages, draws millions of visitors each year.With 3.4 million tourists in 2023 alone, concerns about over-tourism have resurfaced, especially given the island’s limited capacity to handle large-scale evacuations in the event of a disaster.","More than 200 undersea earthquakes have been recorded over the past three days in the Aegean Sea, prompting the government to close schools and send emergency crews to the island.

US treasury says Elon Musk's DOGE team has 'read only' access to payments data,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-treasury-says-elon-musks-doge-team-has-read-only-access-to-payments-data/articleshow/117931684.cms,"People protest during a rally against Elon Musk outside the Treasury Department in Washington, Tuesday, February 4, 2025.

The US Treasury said on Tuesday that Elon Musk ’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team can view data from its payment system but cannot make changes. This statement came after Democratic lawmakers raised concerns and called for an investigation.Musk is leading US President Donald Trump’s federal cost-cutting efforts under the DOGE. As part of this effort, he reportedly pushed for a team led by IT executive Tom Krause to have access to the Treasury’s payment system, which processes transactions like Social Security, Medicare payouts, and federal salaries.As per the news agency AFP, Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden sent a letter to the congressional watchdog agency, asking for an investigation into reports that treasury secretary Scott Bessent personally approved access for Musk and his team.In a letter to Congress, the Treasury confirmed that Krause’s team has access to the system but only in a ""read-only"" capacity for an operational efficiency assessment. The Treasury said this is ""similar to the kind of access that Treasury provides to individuals reviewing Treasury systems, such as auditors.""Musk’s cost-cutting plan has faced opposition from Democratic lawmakers, who have raised legal and ethical concerns.In a separate letter to Trump, other Democratic policymakers voiced concerns about DOGE’s work related to government data and facilities.Labour unions and a grassroots advocacy group have also objected. They filed a lawsuit asking a federal judge to declare it illegal for Musk or DOGE to access taxpayer information and to block the Treasury from allowing it.On X, the social media platform he owns, Musk said Monday that the ""only way to stop fraud and waste of taxpayer money is to follow the payment flows and pause suspicious transactions for review.""According to the lawsuit, Bessent approved Musk’s access after a career official refused and was placed on administrative leave.

Trump wants US to ‘take over’ Gaza Strip: New paradigm or unworkable fantasy?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-us-take-over-of-gaza-strip-israel-palestinian-conflict-benjamin-netanyahu/articleshow/117932659.cms,"Driving the news

At a press conference alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , Trump suggested that Palestinians in Gaza should be permanently resettled in neighboring Arab countries while the US leads reconstruction efforts.

, Trump suggested that Palestinians in Gaza should be permanently resettled in neighboring Arab countries while the US leads reconstruction efforts. His remarks, made at a White House press event, stunned observers both in the US and internationally. Trump not only insisted that the US could take control of Gaza but also refused to rule out deploying American troops ""if necessary"" to enforce this vision. He described Gaza as a ""demolition site"" that should be cleared and redeveloped, adding that he sees a ""long-term ownership position"" for the US in the region.

This latest proposal follows a series of radical foreign policy statements from Trump, who in the past has floated the idea of buying Greenland, warned Panama over control of the canal, and even joked about Canada becoming the 51st US state.

But his statements on Gaza have been met with immediate condemnation, with critics warning that forcibly relocating its population could amount to ethnic cleansing and violate international law.

Why it matters

Trump’s proposal represents an extraordinary break from traditional US policy, which has historically supported a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. For decades, US administrations—both Republican and Democratic—have sought to balance support for Israel’s security with diplomatic efforts to establish a Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank.

If implemented, Trump's plan would likely shatter any remaining hopes for Palestinian sovereignty, further alienate Washington’s Arab allies, and increase tensions in the already volatile Middle East.

Beyond the foreign policy implications, the proposal could also have significant domestic political consequences. Trump’s remarks forced his Republican allies to once again defend or downplay his controversial rhetoric, while Democrats quickly condemned the idea as reckless and dangerous. The statement also diverted attention from other pressing political issues, including President Joe Biden’s handling of the ongoing conflict and US military support for Israel.

What they're saying

Referring to Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, he added: “They want to turn this into resorts.” Jon Alterman, head of Middle East Program at Washington’s Center for Strategic and International Studies, questioned whether Gazans would even consider leaving, given their historical ties to the land: ""Many Gazans descended from Palestinians who fled parts of present-day Israel and have never been able to return to their previous homes. I’m skeptical many would be willing to leave even a shattered Gaza.""

The US will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it, too. We’ll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs … level the site … and create thousands and thousands of jobs.” Donald Trump

Zoom in: Trump’s real estate vision for Gaza

One of the more bizarre aspects of Trump’s remarks was his claim that Gaza, if rebuilt, could become a tourist and business hub akin to “ the Riviera of the Middle East . ”

” Trump : “This could be something that could be so valuable, this could be so magnificent.”

: “This could be something that could be so valuable, this could be so magnificent.” On redevelopment : “We’ll make sure that it’s done world-class … It’ll be wonderful for the people—Palestinians, Palestinians mostly, we’re talking about.”

: “We’ll make sure that it’s done world-class … It’ll be wonderful for the people—Palestinians, Palestinians mostly, we’re talking about.” Trump’s background as a real estate developer has often shaped his approach to geopolitics, leading him to frame complex diplomatic challenges in terms of property deals and economic development.

However, critics argue that his real estate vision ignores the deep political, historical, and security complexities of Gaza.

While economic revitalization of Gaza is essential for long-term peace, achieving it would require diplomatic cooperation, security guarantees, and buy-in from the Palestinian population—none of which Trump has addressed.

The bottom line

President Donald Trump has proposed that the United States ""take over"" and ""own"" the Gaza Strip, arguing that the region should be completely rebuilt and transformed into an economic hub.Trump’s comments have sparked immediate reactions from key political figures, world leaders, and human rights groups.Trump’s foreign policy has long been defined by maximalist proposals that disrupt conventional diplomatic norms. In his first term, he recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, moved the US embassy there, and brokered the Abraham Accords, normalizing relations between Israel and several Arab states. While some dismissed Tuesday’s announcement as another of Trump’s signature hyperbolic provocations, others warned that it reflects a growing shift in US political discourse toward openly discussing Palestinian displacement.Trump’s vision for Gaza raises more questions than answers. His comments raise immediate logistical and legal questions: How would the US claim sovereignty over Gaza? Who would govern it? What security force would oversee its redevelopment? Would any international body recognize such a move?Yet, in typical Trumpian fashion, the US president seemed unfazed by the details. “Everybody I’ve spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land,” he insisted. “We’ll make sure it’s done world class.”Also read: US to 'take over' Gaza; Netanyahu hails Trump as 'greatest friend' of Israel His call for resettling Palestinians echoes the long-held stance of Israel’s far-right politicians, who argue that Gaza’s population should be relocated to neighboring Arab states. However, Egypt and Jordan—two countries already hosting large Palestinian refugee populations—have repeatedly rejected such proposals.The idea of a US military presence in Gaza is also highly controversial. Successive US administrations, including Trump’s own during his first term, have avoided direct military involvement in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict beyond diplomatic and financial support. Deploying US troops to Gaza would not only be a dramatic escalation but could also provoke armed resistance from Palestinian factions and further destabilize the region.Trump’s assertion that regional leaders ""love the idea"" of the US taking control of Gaza has also been met with skepticism. While Netanyahu praised Trump for his ""outside-the-box thinking,"" no Arab leader has publicly endorsed the proposal.Trump’s proposal faces immense hurdles, both legally and diplomatically. Key factors to watch in the coming weeks include:: Republican leaders have largely stayed quiet or downplayed the comments, but divisions could emerge over the idea of a US military presence in Gaza. Democrats have already started condemning the plan, with some warning it could damage US credibility abroad.Countries like Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia have historically rejected any forced displacement of Palestinians. Any serious push for this proposal could severely strain US relations with these key allies.Netanyahu’s embrace of Trump’s ideas could deepen divisions between the Israeli government and the Biden administration. Israel’s far-right factions may push to capitalize on Trump’s rhetoric, making it harder for moderate Israeli voices to advocate for a long-term diplomatic resolution.With Gaza already devastated by war, the focus has been on ceasefire negotiations and humanitarian aid. Trump’s comments could further complicate efforts to secure long-term peace and stability.Trump’s proposal to take over Gaza and resettle its Palestinian population is one of his most radical foreign policy ideas yet. While it aligns with Israel’s far right, it is almost certain to face opposition from US allies, international legal experts, and the Palestinian population itself.His suggestion of a US military role in enforcing the plan raises the stakes even higher, setting up a potential flashpoint in an already volatile region. Whether this is another instance of Trump making extreme statements to shift the debate—or an actual policy he would try to implement—remains to be seen.(With inputs from agencies)","Donald Trump suggested that Palestinians in Gaza should be permanently resettled in neighboring Arab countries while the US leads reconstruction efforts.

‘I would do it in a heartbeat’: Trump weighs plan to outsource US prisoners to El Salvador,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/i-would-do-it-in-a-heartbeat-trump-weighs-plan-to-outsource-us-prisoners-to-el-salvador/articleshow/117931158.cms,"File photo: US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)

US President Donald Trump expressed interest on Tuesday in El Salvador’s offer to house violent US convicts but acknowledged that the move raises significant legal questions.US secretary of state Marco Rubio, who brokered the deal with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, also admitted that constitutional issues must be addressed before the plan can proceed.During a meeting with Bukele on Monday, Rubio secured a commitment that El Salvador would accept deported criminals of any nationality, including American citizens and legal residents convicted of violent crimes. Bukele confirmed the offer on X, saying that his country is willing to “outsource part of the US prison system” for a fee that would be affordable for the US but beneficial to El Salvador.El Salvador’s prison system has been under international scrutiny for its harsh conditions.According to the state department, its facilities suffer from overcrowding, poor sanitation, and inadequate access to basic needs like potable water and ventilation. The country’s new mega-prison (CECOT), built under Bukele’s administration, can house 40,000 inmates and prisoners are subjected to severe restrictions, including no visits or rehabilitation programs.Speaking at the Oval Office, Trump emphasised that he is eager to move forward with the plan if legally permissible. “I’m just saying, if we had the legal right to do it, I would do it in a heartbeat,” he told reporters, according to AP.However, he acknowledged uncertainty over whether US laws allow the transfer of American citizens to foreign prisons.Trump also claimed that “numerous, many” countries have expressed interest in taking American prisoners, although he did not specify which ones, USA Today reported. He argued that outsourcing the incarceration of violent criminals would reduce costs for the US while ensuring these offenders are permanently removed from society.Rubio, speaking alongside Costa Rican President Rodrigo Chaves, admitted that the legal framework for outsourcing US prisoners remains unclear. “We have a Constitution,” he said, emphasising that any such move would need to be carefully vetted.Critics argue that banishing American convicts to foreign countries could violate their constitutional rights, particularly those concerning due process and humane treatment.Meanwhile, Trump’s aggressive foreign policy shifts have sparked controversy within the US government. Thousands of USAID employees have been laid off amid a sweeping freeze on foreign aid, and Rubio has signalled that the state department may absorb parts of USAID, AP reported. The reorganisation has left aid programs in limbo, further complicating US-Central America relations.Bukele’s proposal comes as El Salvador continues its crackdown on gang violence, which has led to the mass incarceration of over 83,000 people with limited due process.While Bukele’s policies have significantly reduced crime, human rights groups warn of widespread abuses in the country’s prisons.Despite the legal uncertainties, Trump remains eager to outsource prisoners, particularly those convicted of violent and repeat offences. “These people are never going to be any good,” he said, suggesting that once transferred, they would remain in El Salvador permanently, as per USA Today.","US President Donald Trump expressed interest in El Salvador's offer to house violent US convicts.

Senate Committee advances Tulsi Gabbard’s nomination for director of national intelligence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/senate-committee-advances-tulsi-gabbards-nomination-for-director-of-national-intelligence/articleshow/117931072.cms,"File photo: Tulsi Gabbard (Picture credit: ANI)

Tulsi Gabbard's nomination as director of national intelligence (DNI) moved a step closer to confirmation after the Senate Intelligence Committee approved it in a narrow 9-8 vote, with all Republicans supporting her and all Democrats opposing.The decision sets the stage for a full Senate vote, where Gabbard will need near-unanimous Republican backing to secure the position.Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii and 2020 presidential candidate, has sparked controversy due to her past comments sympathetic to Russia, her meeting with Syria’s former leader Bashar al-Assad, and her defence of Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who leaked classified intelligence.These issues made her one of the most divisive picks for US President Donald Trump’s cabinet.During her contentious confirmation hearing, Gabbard attempted to clarify her stance on Snowden, stating that while he ""broke the law,"" his leaks exposed ""illegal and unconstitutional programs"" within the US government. However, she avoided directly calling him a traitor, despite repeated questioning from both Republican and Democratic senators, as per AP.Initial Republican support for Gabbard was uncertain, as some lawmakers raised concerns about her lack of intelligence experience and her history of challenging US intelligence agencies.However, a weekend pressure campaign led by Trump supporters, including Elon Musk, helped secure votes. Musk had initially criticised Sen Todd Young for his tough questioning of Gabbard but later called him an ""ally"" after Young announced his support, The New York Times reported.Young, whose opposition could have stalled Gabbard’s nomination, later explained that he backed her after securing written assurances that she would hold officials accountable for unauthorised disclosures and not intervene in discussions about Snowden’s legal status. Other swing votes, such as Sen Susan Collins, also came around after Gabbard pledged to shrink the size of the ODNI and return it to its original coordinating role among intelligence agencies.Democrats have remained firmly opposed to Gabbard’s nomination. Sen Mark Kelly warned that her ""tendency to embrace poorly supported claims"" over intelligence assessments was ""dangerous"". Sen Martin Heinrich went further, labelling her a ""national security risk"" who ""parrots dictators' talking points"", according to The New York Times.With Republicans holding a narrow majority in the Senate, Gabbard’s confirmation is not guaranteed.

Egypt, Jordan reject Idea



Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met US President Donald Trump at the White House late on Tuesday to discuss a truce with Hamas . Trump suggested relocating Palestinians from Gaza to other countries.""It would be my hope that we could do something really nice, really good, where they wouldn't want to return,"" Trump said. ""Why would they want to return? The place has been hell.""Trump earlier said Palestinians would ""love"" a plan to move them to Middle Eastern countries, including Egypt and Jordan. He took credit for securing the Israel-Hamas truce and was expected to ask Netanyahu to move forward with the next phase of the ceasefire.Netanyahu, when asked about the possibility of progress, said, ""We're going to try. That's one of the things we're going to talk about. When Israel and the United States work together, and President Trump and I work together, the chances go up a lot.""Egypt and Jordan rejected Trump's suggestion of relocating Palestinians.Still, Trump, with Netanyahu by his side, said he believes Egypt and Jordan—as well as other countries which he did not name—will ultimately agree to take in Palestinians.“You look over the decades, it’s all death in Gaza,” Trump said. ""This has been happening for years. It’s all death. If we can get a beautiful area to resettle people, permanently, in nice homes where they can be happy and not be shot and not be killed and not be knifed to death like what’s happening in Gaza.”Trump said Palestinians should get a ""fresh, beautiful piece of land"" in another country. ""I think they'd love to leave Gaza if they had an option,"" he said before his meeting with Netanyahu.Israel announced it was sending a delegation to Qatar to discuss the second phase of the ceasefire agreement . Hamas confirmed that negotiations had begun, with spokesperson Abdel Latif al-Qanou saying the focus was on ""shelter, relief and reconstruction.""The first phase of the ceasefire, lasting six weeks, involves the exchange of hostages held in Gaza for prisoners in Israeli custody.Hamas took 251 hostages in its October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Israel says 76 hostages remain in Gaza, including 34 who are dead. Families of Israeli hostages are urging for the agreement to continue to secure their release.Trump said he would also work on restarting efforts for a normalization deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia, which were halted after the Gaza war.Discussions with Netanyahu also included Iran, which supports Hamas and Hezbollah. Before the meeting, Trump signed an order reinstating ""maximum pressure"" on Iran over allegations of nuclear weapon development.Since the ceasefire began on January 19, Israel has conducted operations against militants in the occupied West Bank. The UN warned that conditions in the Jenin refugee camp were worsening.On Tuesday, the Israeli military said a gunman killed two soldiers near Jenin before being shot.Under the ceasefire, 18 hostages have been freed, and around 600 Palestinian prisoners have been released. More aid, including food, fuel, and medicine, has entered Gaza. Some displaced people have returned to the north.Hamas's October 7 attack killed 1,210 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to official Israeli figures. Israel’s response has killed at least 47,518 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.

I never get ahead of the boss, that's why I'm sitting here.""Trump implemented additional 10-percent tariffs on Chinese products, supplementing existing duties against America's primary economic rival. Mexico and Canada had previously faced 25-percent tariffs.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt indicated on Monday that Trump was scheduled to speak with Xi, but stated Tuesday that ""I don't have any updates on when that call will take place.""""He is not going to allow China to continue to source and distribute deadly fentanyl into our country, that was the reason for this tariff,"" Leavitt told reporters outside the West Wing of the White House.Beijing promptly responded by imposing duties on US imports of energy, vehicles and equipment following Trump's implementation of tariffs on Chinese products.China has imposed new tariffs on US imports, with 15-percent duties on coal and liquefied natural gas, whilst 10-percent levies apply to crude oil, agricultural machinery, large-engine vehicles, and pickup trucks.The Chinese authorities announced investigations into US companies, including Google and the corporate owner of Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein brands.Responding to Washington's ""unilateral tariff hike"", Beijing declared these countermeasures and stated its intention to lodge a complaint with the World Trade Organization regarding these ""malicious"" duties.The nation also implemented new restrictions on exporting rare metals and chemicals, including tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, and molybdenum, which are essential for various industrial applications.Meanwhile, financial markets showed uncertainty as investors prepared for potential market turbulence in upcoming weeks regarding Trump's tariff threats against his nation's principal trading partners.While China imported US energy products worth over $7 billion in the previous year, this figure is significantly lower compared to imports from allied nations like Russia, which amounted to $94 billion.Trump has termed tariffs as a crucial diplomatic instrument, stating that 'tariff' is the ""most beautiful"" word in the dictionary. His strategy aims to pressure countries into addressing illegal migration and drug trafficking issues, particularly fentanyl.On Monday, Trump temporarily suspended duties on Mexico and Canada for one month after both nations committed to enhance their efforts against fentanyl trafficking and illegal immigration into the United States.Both Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau secured agreements with Trump, resulting in a 30-day suspension of threatened tariffs, with ongoing discussions planned.Mexico has begun deploying 10,000 troops along its border, as promised in the agreement. ""The deployment has already started,"" Sheinbaum confirmed to reporters.Since Mexico's major anti-drug cartel campaign began in 2006, over 450,000 people have lost their lives nationwide.

He was identified as Badaruddin, alias Yousaf,” it claimed, adding the Afghan authorities had refused to receive the body despite multiple requests from Pakistan.Radio Pakistan stated that US-made night vision equipment, along with M16A4 and M24 sniper rifles, were recovered from the terrorists who were killed.“Badaruddin was directly involved in the new wave of terrorist attacks from Afghanistan into Pakistan. The Afghan Taliban leadership still maintains close ties with terrorist organisations, including the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP),” the report said.

He said one soldier of the Frontier Corps (FC), a paramilitary force, was separately killed in clashes with the militants.“The bodies of the slain soldiers were shifted to Quetta,” Shabbir said. “We don’t know how many attackers were killed because they took the bodies of their fighters into the mountains in the dark.”He said three FC personnel were also injured in the attack, adding that militants set a private bank on fire in Mangochar Bazaar.Separatist groups like BLA have long been at the forefront of a low-level insurgency in Balochistan, Pakistan's largest province by area and rich in mineral resources.
