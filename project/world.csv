The bus, en route from Shiv Khori cave shrine to Mata Vaishno Devi temple in Katra, veered off the road and tumbled down the mountainside.The attack resulted in nine fatalities, including a two-year-old child and a 14-year-old boy, and left 41 others wounded.

KALYAN: Less than three weeks after a blast in the chemical reactor of a Dombivli MIDC factory killed 12 and left 68 injured, a major fire broke out in another factory just around 300 metres from the ill-fated plant on Wednesday, reports.

BHOPAL: Residents of Phoop area in Bhind district of Madhya Pradesh claimed three people, including a 17-year-old youth, died after consuming contaminated tap water, even as the state govt and district administration denied this, only admitting that 76 people were taken ill. While 52 patients took ill on Monday, 24 more cases were reported on Tuesday. The incident was reported from two wards of the Phoop area, where patients complained of vomiting and diarrhoea.Sanjeev Srivastava, collector of Bhind, who visited the affected areas on Wednesday, toldthat 13 people are still hospitalised. “Seventy six people complained of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea. Three of them were referred to Gwalior while seven are still at the Morena health facility,” he said.He denied reports of any casualties and said all other patients were discharged after first aid. “An elderly person with multiple medical issues died, but we can’t say contaminated water was the reason for his death,” Srivastava said.Three ambulances were deployed in Phoop, while ambulances from Gwalior and Morena have been placed on alert.It’s likely that piped water became contaminated when new electricity poles were being installed adjacent to a drain in the area. The machinery used for earthwork likely damaged the domestic water supply line, allowing drain water to seep in and contaminate the water line, sources said.Residents, especially in Wards No. 5, 6, and 7, where the contaminated water was supplied Monday, were worst affected. As the number of patients increased, health dept issued an alert. The collector said they are monitoring the affected wards and patients have been given ORS and necessary medicines.","Residents of Phoop area in Bhind district of Madhya Pradesh claimed three people, including a 17-year-old youth, died after consuming contaminated tap water.

Jailed BrahMos scientist delivered 80 missiles to forces,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jailed-brahmos-scientist-delivered-80-missiles-to-forces/articleshow/110949074.cms,"NAGPUR: Former BrahMos scientist Nishant Agrawal , who was sentenced to life by a sessions court here on June 3 for leaking military secrets to Pakistan, worked in the missile assembly unit at Nagpur and was involved in delivery of close to 80 missiles to the armed forces during his four-year stint.

He had access to customers and delivery locations of missiles, as per Major General (retd) Achyut Deo, general manager, BrahMos Aerospace Private Limited (BAPL), who deposed as a witness during Nishant's trial.

Last week, Nishant was sentenced to life imprisonment by the sessions court under the IT Act and Official Secrets Act. He was accused of passing on secret information on BrahMos missiles to Pak intelligence operatives, who contacted him on social media in the guise of girls. His defence counsel has filed an appeal in high court. TOI has access to his case papers.

Deo, however, told the court he did not come across any instance of Nishant tampering, sharing or misusing information from office computers even though his workstation had more classified information. The data allegedly found in his laptop was already in public domain, Deo told the court.

Deo said he headed the warhead integration and mechanical department and did not receive any negative report about Nishant from the Intelligence Bureau or other security agencies. Nishant was also recommended for the young scientist award in 2018.

However, NN Kumar, executive director (production) at the BrahMos unit, told the court that Nishant was not supposed to keep departmental information in his personal computer, which had a technical description of the missile - CK-310. This was highly classified information and a draft version for approval by technical specialists, he said on record.

Responding to the defence lawyer, the investigating officer of Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terror Squad (ATS) which arrested him in 2018, told the court that both Nishant and his wife were not inclined to Islamist ideology or involved in anti-national activity. ATS officer Pankaj Awasthi went on to say Nishant was not investigated for any assets disproportionate to his income and it's not true that he was not in possession of secret information during his training at the Hyderabad unit.

On May 4, Shankar was arrested by Coimbatore police for his derogatory remark against women police in an interview published by a YouTube channel.

On May 12, he was detained under the Goondas Act on a ground case filed based on a complaint from CMDA for alleged offences of forgery and cheating.

Aggrieved, his mother A Kamala moved the present habeas corpus plea challenging his preventive detention.

Since judges of a vacation bench differed in their opinions in quashing the detention without providing adequate opportunity for the state to respond, the issue was referred to a third judge.

The third judge also opined that the state must be heard before taking a decision in the petition and forwarded the case to the division bench handling HCP portfolio.

On Wednesday, the division bench adjourned the hearing after eight weeks.

Why is Biden going to Europe twice in a week?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-is-biden-going-to-europe-twice-in-a-week/articleshow/110952455.cms,"Air Force One is plenty comfortable if you are its most privileged frequent flier, with a comfortable bedroom and a spacious office. Still, most US presidents will try to avoid making two back-to-back round trips to Europe, separated by about 60 hours on the ground at home. Yet that is what Prez Joe Biden is pulling off this week - for reasons few at the White House seem eager to discuss.Biden left the US for D-Day celebrations in France last Wednesday, June 5, stayed the weekend for a state dinner in Paris, and returned to his home in Delaware late Sunday. He left Washington again early Wednesday, June 12, to fly to Italy for the annual gathering of the G7 .When Biden looks back at those two round trips - roughly a day and a half of flying, all told - he may remember only what happened in between: the conviction of his only living son, Hunter Biden , on charges of lying to obtain a gun permit.But the two round trips beg the question: Why didn't he just stay in Europe for a couple days? He is, after all, 81, and some of his aides who are half his age were complaining about lost sleep cycles.The White House's explanation for four trans-Atlantic crossings in nine days was simply that Biden had commitments in Washington. But by presidential standards, his public schedule looked light: a lunch with vice-president Kamala Harris and a speech to a gun-safety group. Hunter Biden's trial also loomed over the planning, though it was impossible to know when these trips were planned that the case would go to the jury and a verdict would be rendered in the three days between the D-Day trip and the G7 meeting.But privately, some aides said there were election-year optics to be considered. There was no urgent reason to stay in Europe, and a few down days ""might not look right"", one of Biden's advisers conceded. In any case, no one wanted images of the president on what his political opponents might cast as a European holiday, at least while he is running for re-election.The presidency, of course, is the ultimate work-from-anywhere job. There are instant communications (a White House van, bristling with antennas, travels in every motorcade) and a staff of hundreds ready to cater to every contingency, whether that involves sending off a thank-you note or launching a retaliatory nuclear strike.The intolerance for seeing presidents abroad, save for work, has a long history. Franklin D Roosevelt loved to camp at Campobello Island, in Canada, though as president he kept the visits brief. When Harry S Truman went to Potsdam, Germany, to negotiate with Joseph Stalin and Winston Churchill about what post-WWII Europe would look like, he stayed for more than two weeks. There were days off from the negotiations, but not for long, and the nearest big city, Berlin, was a bombed wreck. And there was a reminder of the risks of being out of town: Churchill's party lost to Labour during the conference, and he got booted out of office while it was still going on.","Biden left the US for D-Day celebrations in France last Wednesday, June 5, stayed the weekend for a state dinner in Paris, and returned to his home in Delaware late Sunday.

UN inquiry says Israel & Hamas committed war crimes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/un-inquiry-says-israel-hamas-committed-war-crimes/articleshow/110952432.cms,"A United Nations commission investigating the Oct 7 attacks on Israel and the subsequent conflict in Gaza has accused both Palestinian armed groups and Israel of committing war crimes , and the panel said that Israel's conduct of the war included crimes against humanity.In a report released on Wednesday, the three-person commission - led by South African of Indian Tamil origin Navi Pillay, a former UN human rights chief - provided the most detailed UN examination yet of events on and since Oct. 7. The report does not itself carry any penalties, but it lays out a legal analysis of actions in the Gaza conflict that is likely to be weighed by the International Court of Justice and in other international criminal proceedings. Israel did not cooperate with the probe and protested the panel's assessment, the panel - which also included Miloon Kothari, an Indian expert on human rights - said.The report said Hamas's military wing and six other Palestinian armed groups - aided in some instances by Palestinian civilians - killed and tortured people during Oct 7 assault on Israel in which over 800 civilians were among the over 1,200 killed. An additional 252 people, including 36 kids, were taken hostage, the report said. ""Many abductions were carried out with significant physical, mental and sexual violence and degrading and humiliating treatment, including in some cases parading the abductees,"" it said. Hamas has rejected all accusations.But Israel, during its campaign in Gaza, has also committed war crimes, the commission said, like the use of starvation as a weapon of war through a total siege of Gaza. It said Israel's use of heavy weapons in densely populated areas amounted to a direct attack on the civilian population and had the essential elements of a crime against humanity, disregarding the necessity of distinguishing between combatants and civilians.",U.N. panel says Israel's conduct of the war included crimes against humanity.

US President Joe Biden's son Hunter convicted of all three felony charges in gun trial,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hunter-biden-convicted-on-all-three-felony-charges-in-gun-trial/articleshow/110916748.cms,"NEW DELHI: Hunter Biden has been convicted of all three felony charges related to his 2018 purchase of a revolver. Prosecutors argued that the president’s son lied on a mandatory gun-purchase form by claiming he was not illegally using or addicted to drugs. The jury found him guilty of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application, and illegally possessing the firearm for 11 days.Facing up to 25 years in prison, Biden will be sentenced by Judge Maryellen Noreika. However, first-time offenders typically do not receive the maximum sentence, and it is uncertain if he will serve any prison time.Reacting to the conviction, Hunter Biden said that he's grateful for support from family and friends but 'disappointed' by the verdict.The Hunter Biden case, brought by US Department of Justice Special Counsel David Weiss—a Trump appointee—includes charges of three felony and six misdemeanor tax offenses in California. Weiss also alleges that Hunter Biden failed to pay $1.4 million in taxes between 2016 and 2019, while spending millions on drugs, escorts, exotic cars, and other high-ticket items.The trial followed the May 30 criminal conviction of Trump, marking the first time a former US president was found guilty of a felony. Trump, the Republican challenger, is set to face Democrat Joe Biden in the November 5 election.President Joe Biden has avoided the Delaware courtroom where his son was tried and has commented little on the case, conscious of not appearing to interfere in a matter prosecuted by his own Justice Department. Democratic allies are concerned about the emotional toll on the 81-year-old president, who has long worried about his son’s health and sobriety.Hunter Biden and Trump both claim they are victims of politically motivated prosecutions. While Trump insisted the verdict against him was rigged, President Biden reacted to the conviction he will accept the verdict and will not seek to pardon his son.President Biden issued a statement affirming his unwavering support for his son, alongside First Lady Jill Biden but emphasized his commitment to respecting the judicial process and indicated his readiness to accept the outcome, while also noting Hunter's consideration of an appeal.Expressing their enduring love and support, President Biden underscored their pride in the person Hunter has become, despite the challenges he has faced. He acknowledged the struggles many families endure with loved ones battling addiction, drawing attention to the shared sense of pride in witnessing their strength and resilience in recovery. “So many families who have had loved ones battle addiction understand the feeling of pride seeing someone you love come out the other side and be so strong and resilient in recovery,"" said Biden.Hunter Biden's legal troubles are not over. He faces a September trial in California for failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes, and congressional Republicans plan to continue their impeachment efforts against President Biden. The president has not been accused of any wrongdoing in these investigations.During the trial, the prosecution emphasized the severity of Hunter Biden's drug addiction, presenting personal testimonies and embarrassing evidence. Jurors heard from his ex-wife and a former girlfriend about his habitual crack cocaine use and saw images and videos depicting his addiction. Although Hunter Biden did not testify, prosecutors played excerpts from his 2021 memoir ""Beautiful Things,"" where he describes his struggle with addiction.The prosecution argued that this evidence was crucial to show Hunter Biden was addicted when he purchased the gun, making his denial on the form a lie. Defense attorney Abbe Lowell contended that Hunter's state of mind was different at the time of the purchase and that he did not consider himself addicted then. Lowell suggested that Hunter might have acknowledged a drinking problem but not a drug problem, and alcohol abuse does not disqualify one from purchasing a firearm.Hunter Biden had hoped to resolve the federal investigation with a plea deal last year, avoiding a trial close to the 2024 election. The deal, which included pleading guilty to misdemeanor tax offenses and avoiding prosecution for the gun charge if he remained out of trouble for two years, fell apart after Judge Noreika raised concerns about its unusual terms. Subsequently, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed Delaware’s US Attorney David Weiss as a special counsel, leading to Hunter Biden’s indictment in August.Hunter Biden claims that the charges were a result of the Justice Department yielding to Republican pressure, alleging he received special treatment. The investigation into the revolver began when Hallie Biden, Beau’s widow, found it unloaded in Hunter's truck and disposed of it in a garbage can, where it was later discovered by a man who retrieved it inadvertently. Hallie, who had a romantic relationship with Hunter after Beau's death, eventually called the police. The case was initially closed due to Hunter’s lack of cooperation, where he was considered the victim.(With inputs from agencies)","Hunter Biden found guilty of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application, and illegally possessing the firearm for 11 days.

NEW DELHI: Revealing the cold calculations of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar amid the rising death toll in the Israeli-Gaza war, correspondence obtained by The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) between Sinwar and Hamas officials in Qatar, show that the militant group believes that civilian casualties in Gaza will help it politically.According to the WSJ, Sinwar's messages show he believes that images of dead Palestinians , even if killed by Hamas rockets misfiring, will turn world opinion against Israel and strengthen Hamas's hand. He has instructed his forces to accept some civilian casualties as the price of battle and ""necessary sacrifices"".As per the report, Sinwar, while referring to the war recently wrote to Hamas officials negotiating a hostage deal: ""We have the Israelis right where we want them.""This is not the first time that Sinwar has aired such thoughts.When the three sons of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh were killed in an Israel Air Force strike in Gaza in April, Sinwar affirmed both their deaths and that of other Palestinians would ""infuse life into the veins of this nation, prompting it to rise to its glory and honor"".The correspondence, however, also reveals that he did not approve of women and children being taken hostages during the deadly October 7 attack.The WSJ report cites his messages to negotiators as saying, ""Things went out of control"".""People got caught up in this, and that shouldn't have happened,"" he wrote.Sinwar was also reportedly discontent with Hamas officials meeting with other factions in December to debate reconciliation after the war, which he labeled ""shameful and outrageous"".He reportedly added: ""As long as fighters are still standing and we have not lost the war, such contacts should be immediately terminated ... We have the capabilities to continue fighting for months.""Referring to the recent ground operation in Rafah that has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Gazans, Sinwar wrote to Hamas leaders in Qatar that ""Israel's journey in Rafah won't be a walk in the park"".The WSJ report further noted that Sinwar’s recent messages to Hamas allies illustrate an inclination to die while fighting.Sinwar equated the Gaza war to the battle of Karbala in Iraq, which occurred in the 7th century and in which the grandson of the prophet Muhammed was killed. ""We have to move forward on the same path we started,"" Sinwar said, adding ""or let it be a new Karbala"".More than 37,124 Palestinians have been killed and 84,712 have been injured in Israel's military offensive on Gaza since October 7, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Monday.","Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar believes that images of dead Palestinians will turn world opinion against Israel.

They also added a speech bubble to the cartoon figure, reading: ""No cheese, Gromit. Look at all this cruelty on RSPCA farms!""Animal Rising released footage showing two of its supporters carrying out the act, which they said aimed to highlight cruelty on farms that have received the RSPCA's ""Assured"" status, indicating higher welfare standards. King Charles is the patron of the RSPCA, an animal charity.The RSPCA expressed strong disapproval of the protest. ""We are shocked by this vandalism of His Majesty the King's portrait. While we welcome scrutiny of our work, we cannot condone illegal activity of any kind,"" a spokesperson said, adding that the charity takes allegations about its certified farms very seriously.This incident is the latest in a series of activist attacks on artwork in the UK.

Juniper expressed hope that the protest would prompt the king to reconsider his association with the RSPCA, given the alleged suffering on its certified farms.Animal Rising assured that their posters were designed to be easily removable and would not damage the painting by artist Jonathan Yeo.

NEW DELHI: Malawi mourns the loss of its Vice President Saulos Chilima and nine others following a fatal plane crash , confirmed by President Lazarus Chakwera on Tuesday.The wreckage of the military aircraft transporting Vice President Chilima was discovered in a rugged mountainous area in the northern region of the country after an extensive search spanning more than a day. Regrettably, there were no survivors, President Chakwera announced in a somber live address broadcast on state television.The tragic incident unfolded as the aircraft, carrying Vice President Chilima and former first lady Shanil Dzimbiri, among others, vanished from radar during its scheduled 45-minute flight from the capital city, Lilongwe, to Mzuzu in the north.Air traffic controllers redirected the plane away from Mzuzu's airport due to adverse weather conditions and poor visibility, instructing it to return to Lilongwe. However, contact with the aircraft was abruptly lost thereafter, leaving authorities grappling with the unfolding crisis.The aircraft, identified as a small, propeller-driven plane operated by the Malawian armed forces, was carrying seven passengers and three military crew members, according to President Chakwera. The search and rescue operation, spanning a vast forest plantation in the Viphya Mountains near Mzuzu, involved approximately 600 personnel, comprising soldiers, police officers, forest rangers, and volunteers from organizations like the Malawi Red Cross.General Valentino Phiri, commander of the Malawian armed forces, described the challenging terrain and dense forest cover as formidable obstacles impeding search efforts. Despite the daunting conditions, authorities remained resolute in their commitment to locating the wreckage and any possible survivors.President Chakwera expressed gratitude for the international support extended by the United States, the United Kingdom, Norway, and Israel, who offered specialized technologies to aid in the search operation. Assistance from neighboring Zambia and Tanzania was also enlisted, with additional helicopters and drones dispatched to bolster search efforts.Chilima was serving his second term as vice president. He was also in the role from 2014-2019 under former President Peter Mutharika. He was a candidate in the 2019 Malawian presidential election and finished third, behind the incumbent, Mutharika, and Chakwera. The vote was later annulled by Malawi’s Constitutional Court because of irregularities.Chilima then joined Chakwera’s campaign as his running mate in an historic election rerun in 2020, when Chakwera was elected president. It was the first time in Africa that an election result that was overturned by a court resulted in a defeat for the sitting president.Chilima had previously been facing corruption charges over allegations that he received money in return for influencing the awarding of government procurement contracts for the Malawi armed forces and the police, but prosecutors dropped the charges last month. He had denied the allegations, but the case led to criticism that Chakwera’s administration was not taking a hard enough stance against graft.","Malawi mourns the loss of its Vice President Saulos Chilima and nine others following a fatal plane crash.

""We must always maintain our vigilance and cannot rule out the possibility of taking countermeasures.""In March, two Taiwanese fishermen strayed into Chinese waters near the Taiwan-controlled Kinmen islands, which sit next to China's coast.

Blinken says some of Hamas' proposed changes to a cease-fire plan in Gaza are workable and some not,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/blinken-says-some-of-hamas-proposed-changes-to-a-cease-fire-plan-in-gaza-are-workable-and-some-not/articleshow/110945200.cms,"Hamas asks for amendments'

Revenge for slain commander

BEIRUT: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that the war in Gaza would go on after Hamas proposed ""numerous"" changes to a US-backed cease-fire plan, some that he said were ""workable"" and some not. He did not spell out what the changes were. Speaking to reporters in Qatar, Blinken said the US and other mediators will keep trying to ""close this deal.""Blinken is in the region to push a cease-fire proposal with global support that has not been fully embraced by Israel or Hamas. The militant group submitted its first official response late Tuesday, requesting ""amendments"" to the deal.The American's comments came as Lebanon's Hezbollah fired a massive barrage of rockets into northern Israel to avenge the killing of a top commander, further escalating regional tensions.Hezbollah, an Iran-backed ally of Hamas, has traded fire with Israel nearly every day since the 8-month-long Israel-Hamas war began and says it will only stop if there is a truce in Gaza. That has raised fears of an even more devastating regional conflagration.Air raid sirens sounded across northern Israel, and the military said that about 160 projectiles were fired from southern Lebanon, making it one of the largest attacks since the fighting began. There were no immediate reports of casualties as some were intercepted while others ignited brush fires.Hamas has expressed support for the broad outline of the deal but wariness over whether Israel would implement its terms.Hamas spokesman Jihad Taha told the Lebanese news outlet ElNashra that the ""amendments"" requested by the group include guarantees of a permanent cease-fire and the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.Hamas's official reply to the proposal, which it conveyed to mediators on Tuesday, appeared to be short of outright acceptance but kept negotiations alive.Qatar and Egypt, which have been key mediators alongside the United States, said they were studying it.Blinken is on his eighth visit to the region since the start of the war.The proposal has raised hopes of ending a conflict in which Israel's bombardment and ground offensives in Gaza have killed over 37,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health officials, and driven some 80 per cent of the population of 2.3 million from their homes. Israeli restrictions and ongoing fighting have hindered efforts to bring humanitarian aid to the isolated coastal enclave, fueling widespread hunger.Israel launched its campaign after Hamas and other militants stormed into Israel on October 7, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 hostage. Over 100 hostages were released during a weeklong cease-fire last year in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.Hamas is still holding around 120 hostages, a third of whom are believed to be dead.The proposal announced by Biden calls for a three-phase plan that would begin with a six-week cease-fire and the release of some hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces would withdraw from populated areas and Palestinian civilians would be allowed to return to their homes.Phase one also requires the safe distribution of humanitarian assistance ""at scale throughout the Gaza Strip,"" which Biden said would lead to 600 trucks of aid entering Gaza every day.At the same time, negotiations would be launched over the second phase, which is to bring ""a permanent end to hostilities, in exchange for the release of all other hostages still in Gaza, and a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.""Phase three would launch ""a major multi-year reconstruction plan for Gaza and the return of the remains of any deceased hostages still in Gaza to their families.""The militant group accepted a similar proposal last month that was rejected by Israel.Netanyahu's far-right coalition allies have rejected the latest proposal and have threatened to bring down his government if he ends the war leaving Hamas intact. But Netanyahu is also under mounting pressure to accept a deal to bring the hostages back.Thousands of Israelis, including families of the hostages, have demonstrated in favor of the US-backed plan.Hezbollah said it fired missiles and rockets at two military bases in retaliation for the killing of Taleb Sami Abdullah, 55. Known within Hezbollah as Hajj Abu Taleb, he is the most senior commander killed since the fighting began eight months ago. The Israeli strike destroyed a house where Abdullah and three other officials were meeting, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the border, late Tuesday.A Hezbollah official told The Associated Press that Abdullah was in charge of a large part of the Lebanon-Israel front, including the area facing the Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona, which Hezbollah has repeatedly attacked in recent days, causing fires in the area.The official, who was not authorized to speak to media and spoke on condition of anonymity, said Abdullah had joined Hezbollah decades ago and took part in attacks against Israeli forces during their 18-year occupation of southern Lebanon that ended in May 2000.Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon have killed over 400 people, most of them Hezbollah members, but the dead also include more than 70 civilians and non-combatants. On the Israeli side, 15 soldiers and 10 civilians have been killed since the war in Gaza began.Other groups allied with Iran, including powerful militias in Iraq and Syria, and the Houthi rebels in Yemen, have also attacked Israeli, US and other targets since the start of the war, often drawing Western retaliation.In April, Israel and Iran traded fire directly for the first time.US President Joe Biden 's administration has said the best way to calm regional tensions is for Hamas to accept a proposal for a phased cease-fire that it says would end of the war in Gaza and bring about the release of the remaining hostages abducted in Hamas' October 7 attack that ignited the war. The UN Security Council voted overwhelmingly in favor of the plan on Monday.Biden says it is an Israeli proposal, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has sent conflicting signals, saying Israel remains committed to destroying Hamas.It's unclear how it would do that if the US-backed proposal, which includes an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, is fully implemented.","US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the war in Gaza would go on after Hamas proposed ""numerous"" changes to a US-backed cease-fire plan.

Will US President's son Hunter Biden go to jail? Here's what we know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/will-us-presidents-son-hunter-biden-go-to-jail-heres-what-we-know/articleshow/110928961.cms,"Hunter Biden conviction: Here's all you need to know

Hunter Biden was convicted of lying on a mandatory gun purchase form as he said he was not illegally using or addicted to drugs. He had the gun illegally for 11 years. So the first two counts were for lying and the third was for possessing the gun while addicted to drugs. In Hunter Biden's defense, his gun was not used in a crime. His lawyers said he never fired the gun and it was thrown in trash after 11 days. Hunter Biden will appeal against the conviction but it's not clear on what grounds. Joe Biden said he would not pardon his son. So a presidential pardon stands ruled out as of now. This is the first time that a president's immediate family member has been found guilty of a crime during the term of the president. But Hunter Biden's crimes took place before his father's tenure as president. What Hunter Biden said after the verdict: He said he is ""more grateful for the love and support"" of his family than he is ""disappointed by the outcome"". CNN reported that the jury was split during the deliberations. One said the case ""seemed like a waste of taxpayer dollars"", while three jurors quoted by CNN said they believed that they had no choice but to find Hunter Biden guilty. After the verdict, as Joe Biden landed at the Delaware Air National Guard base, his first gesture was to hug Hunter. 53-year-old Hunter Biden is not new to controversies and his life has been a saga of personal, professional tragedies. Hunter and his father together survived the deaths of Biden's first wife, eldest daughter and eldest son. Hunter Biden maintained that he had been sober since 2019.

US to send another patriot missile system to Ukraine after repeated demands,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-to-send-another-patriot-missile-system-to-ukraine-after-repeated-demands/articleshow/110926529.cms,"KYIV : US president Joe Biden has approved the deployment of another patriot missile system to Ukraine amid raging conflict with Russia , senior administration and military officials said.Biden's decision came last week, the officials said, after a series of high-level meetings and an internal debate over how to meet Ukraine's pressing needs for bolstered air defences without jeopardizing US combat readiness. This comes as Kyiv is struggling to fend off Russian attacks on its cities, infrastructure and electrical grid.The new patriot system, the second that the United States has sent to Ukraine, will come from Poland, where it has been protecting a rotational force of American troops who will be returning to the US, officials said.According to the officials, the system could be deployed to Ukraine's front lines in the next several days, depending on any maintenance or modifications it needs.Considered one of the United States' best air defence weapons, the Patriot includes a powerful radar system and mobile launchers that fire missiles at incoming projectiles.It is also one of the scarcest weapons systems in the US arsenal. Pentagon officials refuse to disclose how many it has, but one senior military official said that the army has deployed only 14 of them, in the US and around the world.Notably, patriots are also held by American allies and two of those nations have sent a couple to Ukraine, but US officials say they hope European powers will send more.Pentagon officials did not want to move any batteries from the US. There is a patriot battery at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, for training American and Ukrainian troops, but moving it would take away training, the officials said. Other batteries protecting bases and troops in the US, including in Hawaii, were either deemed too far away or necessary for homeland defence.Defence secretary Lloyd Austin and other senior Pentagon leaders have appealed to European allies to transfer their systems to Ukraine.Two other nations have responded to Ukraine's plea for more Patriots. Germany has so far deployed one Patriot system, and Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said a second would be deployed by the end of June. The Netherlands has also deployed a Dutch-American battery in Ukraine, and negotiations are underway to send a second.The Biden administration officials hope the deployment of another US patriot system will nudge allies to do the same.During US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's trip to Kyiv last month, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said Ukraine urgently needed ""seven batteries, of which two batteries are necessary, and they were necessary so that we could protect the city of Kharkiv and the entire region of Kharkiv.""Beyond Kharkiv, Ukraine must take urgent steps to protect Odesa in the south, military analysts said, as well as the country's electrical grid.In recent months, a barrage of Russian missile and drone strikes on Ukraine's power plants and substations has severely hobbled energy infrastructure, forcing Ukrainian authorities to order nationwide rolling blackouts. This has raised concerns about what will happen when the cold weather arrives and the use of heating devices increases the load on the energy system.The US officials said there was little high-level debate over whether to supply Ukraine with another patriot. But officials said that Austin and general Charles Q Brown Junior, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, debated which of the US Patriots to send.The two men assessed that the Pentagon could move a patriot battery in Poland, which had the benefit of being next door to Ukraine.The issue is again expected to come up this week when Austin and general Brown travel to Belgium for Nato and allied defence meetings.""I think you can expect to see air defence will, for all the obvious reasons, be a topic of discussion,"" major general Patrick S Ryder, the Pentagon spokesman, said on Monday.The patriot is by far the most expensive single weapon system that the United States has supplied to Ukraine, at a total cost of about USD 1.1 billion: USD 400 million for the system and USD 690 million for the missiles.","US president Joe Biden has approved the deployment of another patriot missile system to Ukraine amid raging conflict with Russia.

US judge strikes down Florida ban on gender-affirming healthcare,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-judge-strikes-down-florida-ban-on-gender-affirming-healthcare/articleshow/110924075.cms,"A federal judge ruled on Tuesday that parts of Florida's ban of puberty blockers and hormone therapy for transgender children and restrictions on gender-affirming healthcare for adults are unconstitutional and ordered that it not be enforced.Republican Florida governor Ron DeSantis signed the restrictions into law in 2023, banning people under the age of 18 from receiving puberty blockers or hormone therapy to treat gender dysphoria, though the law allowed children who had begun receiving gender-affirming care before May 17, 2023, to continue to do so with new restrictions.The law, part of a slew of restrictive legislation in recent years advanced by Republicans to regulate the lives of transgender people, also imposed new restrictions on adults receiving gender-affirming healthcare.US District Judge Robert Hinkle in Tallahassee ruled that all those elements violated the US Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law, noting that some Florida legislators ""plainly acted from old-fashioned discriminatory animus.""""Gender identity is real,"" he wrote in his order, ruling that it was unconstitutional to discriminate against transgender people. ""In time, discrimination against transgender individuals will diminish, just as racism and misogyny have diminished.""A spokesperson for DeSantis, who signed the ban into law shortly before announcing his failed bid to become the Republican nominee for the US presidential election, said the state would appeal the ruling and referred to gender-affirming healthcare as an aspect of ""radical, new age 'gender ideology.'""""These procedures do permanent, life-altering damage to children, and history will look back on this fad in horror,"" the spokesperson, Julia Friedland, said in a statement.The judge noted that doctors who treat transgender patients, multiple medical associations and the US Department of Health have widely accepted that the therapies banned by Florida are ""well-established standards of care for treatment of gender dysphoria.""Several parents of transgender children, who were plaintiffs in the lawsuit, gave testimony to the court that gender-affirming healthcare was allowing their children to flourish and be happy. A transgender man, another plaintiff, testified that Florida's new restrictions had interrupted his taking of testosterone when his prescription lapsed, causing distress, anxiety and depression.Because the law allowed healthcare providers to continue providing puberty blockers or hormone therapy to children and adults who are not transgender, Hinkle ruled that the law unconstitutionally discriminated on the basis of sex.Doctors who violated the law faced up to five years in prison.The judge noted that Florida lawmakers and Governor DeSantis, in passing the law, spoke openly about their moral disapproval of transgender people. This hindered the state's lawyers from successfully arguing that the law was a good-faith effort to regulate healthcare and not motivated by unconstitutional discriminatory animus.""The statute and the rules were an exercise in politics, not good medicine,"" the judge wrote. ""The great weight of medical authority supports these treatments.""","A federal judge ruled that parts of Florida's ban of puberty blockers and hormone therapy for transgender children are unconstitutional. The law also imposed new restrictions on adults receiving gender-affirming healthcare.

This allowed elected local representatives to continue the provision of services to their electorate. The local elections were subsequently held in August 2023 for 72 key positions in 21 districts.Commenting on the law and order situation in the province, the rights body alleged that over 160 policemen, 70 military personnel, 60 civilians, and more than 170 alleged militants were killed in dozens of targeted militant attacks and security operations in 2023.Attempting to address the situation, Pakistan forcibly deported over 1.5 million documented and 0.7 million undocumented Afghan refugees and migrants from the province following an announcement by the federal caretaker government.Shedding light on the financial issues faced by people, the rights body stated that hundreds of teachers, doctors, health workers, and sanitation workers protested against delays in payment of salaries and other dues in separate demonstrations across the province in 2023.The report also addressed the status of Public health and environmental crises which has been a major issue of concern to the citizens. The HRCP report stated, that at least 11 per cent of the population suffers from drug abuse, and around 40 fatalities from rains, flash floods, and dust storms occur in several districts.Persons with disabilities also remained deprived of essential accessibility measures in most buildings despite court orders, and 4.7 million children, 66 per cent of which included girls, remained out of school in 2023, the report added.According to HRCP's media monitoring for 2023, there were at least 20 cases of domestic violence, 72 cases of sexual violence, 49 'honour' killings, and 246 femicide-related murders that reportedly took place in the province.HRCP cited a report from the Digital Rights Foundation, which stated that 112 complaints related to cyber harassment and gender-based violence were reported from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.In January, women councilors from the Khyber district elected in the 2021 local government polls protested the denial of functional authority and development funds to help female constituents of their areas.While over 100 women contested in the polls and several were elected, they had neither been provided offices nor resources, unlike their male counterparts, thereby lowering their status in people's perceptions, the report added.","The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), in its annual report, highlighted the precarious situation of human rights, law and order.

The joint declaration, however, noted that Beijing would not push businesses to take unwarranted risks or make concessions to Pakistani companies. Instead, the statement said, Beijing would support businesses to invest in Pakistan in line with market and commercial principles.Observers, however, pointed out that obstacles still stand in the way of strengthening Beijing-Islamabad economic collaboration, primarily as a result of Pakistan’s misguided policies.Pakistan is currently experiencing a debt crisis and looking for new loans to pay off previous debt.The total debt that Pakistan owes just to power (electricity) plants established under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) stands at around $7.5 billion. Islamabad also owes nearly $2 billion in circular debt, or unpaid bills, to Chinese electricity producers.During Sharif’s visit, no public statement was issued on restructuring debt but experts believe the issue is crucial and cannot be ignored.Pakistan’s current foreign debt, media reports suggest, is close to $130 billion, and Chinese officials say around 13% of it is owed to China.During the visit, Sharif, along with Gen Munir, also held talks with Chinese president Xi Jinping for more than three hours, indicating that the security of its nationals in Pakistan is a key concern for Beijing. Five Chinese workers were killed in a suicide attack in Pakistan’s northwestern Bisham region in March. Pakistan had blamed Afghanistan-based terrorists for the attack. The ruling Afghan Taliban had rejected Pakistan’s claim, saying Islamabad was trying to sour Kabul’s relations with Beijing.In the joint statement, both sides urged Afghanistan to “firmly combat terrorism, including not allowing its territory to be used for terrorist acts”.","Pakistan prime minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Tuesday that his trip to China last week was successful.

"Nawaz reaches out for peace, PM Modi says security remains India’s priority",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/nawaz-reaches-out-for-peace-pm-modi-says-security-remains-indias-priority/articleshow/110883535.cms,"NEW DELHI: Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif congratulated his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi for taking over as prime minister for the third time but more significant was a felicitation message from the elder Sharif - former PM Nawaz Sharif - who spoke about replacing hate with hope and seizing this “opportunity to shape the destiny of the two billion people of South Asia”. Modi expressed appreciation for the message, saying the people of India have always stood for peace, security and progressive ideas.“Advancing the well-being and security of our people shall always remain our priority,” said Modi, who did not invite Pakistan for the inauguration of his third term. Modi’s emphasis on security is in line with his government’s long held position that Pakistan’s continued support to cross-border terrorism is not conducive for dialogue.Nawaz had just before the election outcome too reached out to India’s incoming government by reiterating his position that it was Pakistan which had violated his 1999 peace agreement with India in the form of the Lahore Declaration through its Kargil offensive. However, his remarks now constitute the first direct peace outreach to India since the coalition government in Pakistan took power earlier this year.Nawaz said Modi’s success in elections reflects the confidence of the people in his leadership. “Let us replace hate with hope and seize the opportunity to shape the destiny of the two billion people of South Asia,” said Nawaz, who was recently re-elected president of his party, in a post on X.Coming from the most powerful civilian leader in Pakistan, and one who is known to share a close rapport with Modi himself, the remarks are particularly significant. Modi thanked Shehbaz for his message.It was under Modi and Nawaz - in 2015 when then foreign minister Sushma Swaraj visited Islamabad - that the 2 sides had their last substantive bilateral engagement. That dialogue saw India and Pakistan relaunching the dialogue process under the new name of comprehensive bilateral dialogue. This was followed by Modi’s famous drop by, and only visit to Pakistan as PM, in Lahore on Nawaz’s birthday but that initiative also quickly fizzled out because of the Pathankot terror attack and later the Uri attack.India has refused to have any diplomatic engagement ever since, except for the Indus Waters Treaty talks, and Pakistan itself decided to downgrade ties by recalling its high commissioner in 2019 after India revoked the special status of the erstwhile state of J&K.The 2 countries will have an opportunity to attempt a reset in ties next month when both PMs travel to Kazakhstan for the SCO summit. However, it’s unlikely India will propose any meeting, given the understanding in the government that Pakistan is yet to act decisively against cross-border terrorism. Official sources also maintain Pakistan has to review its decision to downgrade ties before nursing any thought of forward movement in the relationship.Nawaz’s call for working together also doesn’t sit well with Pakistan’s official position that India must reverse its “unilateral and illegal” measures in J&K for talks to take place. With the Supreme Court upholding the revocation of the special status, the Indian government believes Pakistan cannot have any say in how the internal affairs of J&K are run.","Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif congratulated his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi for taking over as prime minister for the third time.

"Amid ties with Pakistan nosediving, Afghan Taliban looks at other regional powers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/amid-ties-with-pakistan-nosediving-afghan-taliban-looks-at-other-regional-powers/articleshow/110883019.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Afghan Taliban has intensified its efforts to open different channels of communication with the regional and neighbouring countries in the wake of its relations with Pakistan constantly declining and growing more hostile post US withdrawal from Afghanistan .In addition to participation in World Economic Forum in St Petersburg, Russia, the Taliban leaders had reached out to Iran, China, Russia and the UAE. Nations in West Asia and elsewhere have also reached out to them.Recently, Abu Dhabi ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan had a meeting in Kabul with Taliban home minister Sirajuddin Haqqani, who also heads the Haqqani network, a powerful faction within the governing group.Kabul had approached New Delhi, through its deputy foreign minister Sher Muhammad Abbas Stanikzai, soon after the formation of the interim govt in Afghanistan in 2021. The correspondence between the two sides had opened a window for communication, which culminated into formal contacts.On the contrary, the ties between Islamabad and Kabul are growing more hostile every day. Kabul’s refusal to curb the alleged activities of Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants on its soil has seriously dented relations between the two countries. Travel restrictions on Afghan nationals and the expulsion of Afghan refugees from Pakistan further worsened the ties.Experts suggest that Kabul’s diplomatic efforts will not yield any results until they focus on solving problems such as human rights, women's education and employment.Sweden-based Afghan analyst Nur Rehman Sherzad said that since coming to power in August 2021, the Taliban govt has not formulated any foreign policy.According to him, a govt that is not officially recognised by any country does not have diplomatic and legal status in its relations with the international community and neighbouring countries.“The representatives of the Taliban govt are now gradually realising that the policies of the last three years are not bringing any significant results,” Sherzad said, adding that officials of the international community and other countries in the region visit Afghanistan also to inform Kabul about their security concerns.Describing the acceleration in the Taliban's diplomatic efforts, Arif Yusufzai, an expert on Afghan affairs, told TOI that these types of contacts help build mutual intelligence ties. According to him, the Taliban are making many claims on their own, but they are not doing what the international community is asking them to do. “They are not changing their behaviour at all,” he added.Afghan journalist Abdul Haq Omari believes that Taliban currently face two challenges for the survival of their power. One is to establish formal relations with foreign countries and the other is to maintain their religious narrative internally under which they had fought for two decades.“The survival of the religious narrative is important for the Taliban because if they withdraw suddenly, Taliban's rival groups in Afghanistan, Islamic State or Daesh Khorasan, may strengthen the anti-Taliban narrative,” he added.","Afghan Taliban has intensified its efforts to open different channels of communication with the regional and neighbouring countries.

Pakistani man sent to mental hospital after trying to form gay club,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-man-sent-to-mental-hospital-after-trying-to-form-gay-club/articleshow/110881718.cms,"NEW DELHI: A Pakistani man who attempted to establish the nation's first gay club has been sent to a mental hospital following claims by religious conservatives that his actions were influenced by a recent return from the UK The man, whose identity was not disclosed in a news report by UK's the Telegraph, submitted an application to set up the club in Abbottabad, a conservative city in northern Pakistan with nearly 240 million residents.In his application to city officials, he proposed that the club, to be named Lorenzo, would serve as a ""great convenience and resource for many homosexual , bisexual, and even some heterosexual people residing in Abbottabad in particular, and in other parts of the country in general.""However, gay sex is criminalized in Pakistan, punishable by prison sentences of up to two years. Additionally, the deeply conservative culture makes it difficult to be openly gay.As a result, the man was transferred to the Sarhad hospital for psychiatric diseases in Peshawar on May 9. He faced significant abuse for his application from local citizens and politicians alike.As per the Telegraph report, the leader of the Jamiat Ulema Islam (JUI) party, a conservative religious group, claimed that the applicant's attempt to set up the club followed a recent return from the UK. A local MP from the far-Right Pakistan Awami Tehreek party expressed extreme opposition, stating he would have doused the club with petrol and set it alight, while the party leader, Naseer Khan Nazir, warned of ""very severe consequences"" if the club was allowed to open.Friends of the man, who were also unnamed, expressed fear for his well-being and reported being blocked from visiting him or obtaining any information about him. ""Everyone is afraid that talking about it will put them in danger,"" one friend said. ""I do not know about his well-being for many days,"" they added, noting their unsuccessful attempts to gather information about him.Before his hospitalization, he told the paper, ""I talk about human rights and I want everyone's human rights to be defended."" He emphasized his commitment to advocating for the rights of the most neglected community in Pakistan, saying, ""If the authorities refuse, then I will approach the court, and I hope that like the Indian court, the Pakistani court will rule in favor of gay people.""His application clearly said that there would be ""no gay (or non-gay) sex (other than kissing)"" at the club, with a notice on the wall warning, ""no sex on premises."" This measure was intended to ensure that no legal constraints, including the outdated anti-sodomy law PPC section 377, would be violated on the premises.","A Pakistani man who attempted to establish the nation's first gay club has been sent to a mental hospital.
