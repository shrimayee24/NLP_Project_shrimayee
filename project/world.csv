HC acquits man convicted by Pocso court of raping daughter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-acquits-man-convicted-by-pocso-court-of-raping-daughter/articleshow/117503073.cms,"NAGPUR: Bombay HC's Nagpur bench recently overturned an Amravati Pocso court order convicting a 43-year-old man of sexually assaulting his daughter for seven years until she turned 14. Justice Govinda Sanap suggested a possible motive behind the allegations, saying the father opposed his daughter's marriage to a youth of her choice, who she married shortly after the rape case was filed by her grandmother in Jan 2019.""It's true that in ordinary circumstances, a daughter would not level such an allegation against her father. Similarly, a father would also not sexually assault his daughter. However, considering human psychology and tendency, mistakes can occur, even in the case of the father, who is ordinarily considered as protector of the children,"" Justice Sanap said.While quashing the Pocso court's Feb 2021 judgment that sentenced the father to 10 years in prison and a fine of Rs 5,000, HC said the girl ""and her boyfriend were in an intimate relationship"", but her father deemed him an unsuitable match. This disagreement fuelled her distress, possibly prompting her to ""lodge a false report"" against the father, the judge said.""Except her words, there is no other evidence. Even if it is presumed the man was addicted to liquor as per the daughter's allegation, it would not weigh in favour of the prosecution. She has nowhere stated that her father did not look after their well-being,"" HC said.""The father who looked after the survivor in the absence of her mother would not perpetrate such an act with his daughter. He was the family's lone earning member and must have toiled hard to sustain the family. This is another vital circumstance,"" the judge said."," Bombay HC's Nagpur bench recently overturned an Amravati Pocso court order convicting a 43-year-old man of sexually assaulting his daughter for seven years until she turned 14.

KOLKATA: Father of Shariful Fakir, the illegal Bangladeshi immigrant arrested by Mumbai police for allegedly stabbing actor Saif Ali Khan during a burglary attempt at his Bandra home, claimed that police have framed his son. He said Shariful is not the person shown in the video from the initial CCTV footage released the day after the attack.""They have arrested my son as a suspect, but he is not the one whose photograph police had released after the incident. The man in the photograph had long hair that touched his eyes. My son has always had shorter hair raised upwards. They have picked him up as he has some similarities. He is also an easy target as he had entered India illegally,"" Md Rohul Amin, 55, told TOI over a WhatsApp call from Bangladesh.Amin, who is also a village-level Bangladesh Nationalist Party functionary, said he is speaking to senior politicians in his country to raise the ""false arrest"" of his son as a diplomatic issue. Shariful is the second among Rohul's three sons. While his elder son works at a private firm in Dhaka, the younger son is still in school. Shariful dropped out from school after Class 10 and started doing odd jobs after Rohul lost his job at Khulna jute mill.""We may be poor, but we are not criminals. In Bangladesh, he used to ride a bike taxi for a living. But during the era of Awami League, there was a lot of political turmoil in our village and after Sheikh Hasina's govt came back to power early last year. Since my son was an active supporter of Khaleda Zia, he faced immense backlash and so he decided to leave Bangladesh for better earning and living prospects,"" said Rohul.He said Shariful got in touch with an agent who helped him illegally cross the border and enter India in April last year. While Mumbai police said he crossed Dawki river to reach Meghalaya and then reach Bengal via Assam, his father couldn't specify the details. ""He hadn't shared with us about how he had exactly entered India but there are multiple persons like him who leave Bangladesh and head for India illegally for work. Once he reached India, he went to Bengal and worked at a restaurant for a few days, before he went to Mumbai and started working at a bar. He had also met a relative of ours in Bengal but he refused him accommodation,"" said Rohul, who now works as a farmer at Rajabaria village in Jhalokhathi of Bangladesh.Rohul said Friday evening, more than 38 hours since the stabbing incident at Saif's Bandra residence, Shariful called home and told his father that he had transferred 10,000 Bangladeshi taka via a hawala agent leaving only 3,000 taka for himself. ""We know he had done several illegal things, like straying into India and sending money illegally. He may have some politically-motivated cases against him in Bangladesh but one thing I can assure is that my son is not a criminal. He can never loot or attack someone. We demand justice,"" he said, breaking down into tears.",Shariful Fakir's father claims his son was wrongfully arrested for allegedly stabbing actor Saif Ali Khan.

The conspiracy theories

NEW DELHI: Actor Saif Ali Khan was stabbed on January 16 at his 12th-floor apartment in the upscale Bandra area in Mumbai. As the actor underwent two surgeries, got discharged after 5 days and police arrested a Bangladeshi man in connection with the attack, several angles have come up in the last eight days along with various conspiracy angles.In a startling incident, Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan suffered multiple stab wounds from an intruder who broke into his luxury Bandra flat on the 12th floor last week. The actor was taken to nearby Lilavati Hospital in an auto.The 54-year-old actor was out of danger following an emergency surgery. Police registered a case of 'armed robbery with an attempt to cause death or grievous hurt'.During the confrontation, Khan's house help, who alerted others in the house about the intruder, also received a minor hand injury. She subsequently filed an official complaint with the police.Eliyama Philip, aged 56, who works as a nurse at Khan's home, described the frightening incident. The assailant, identified as a thin-built man around his late 30s with a dark complexion, made his way into the bedroom where Saif Ali Khan's 4-year-old son, Jeh, was asleep.Armed with a stick and a sharp blade, the perpetrator first demanded Rs 1 crore from Philip. Upon her refusal, he attacked her, resulting in injuries to her wrists and hand.The disturbance alerted the nanny, Junu, who called for help, leading Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor Khan to hurry to the location. Saif Ali Khan, while protecting his family, engaged with the assailant but suffered injuries. He received cuts on his neck, shoulder, back, and wrist. The assailant escaped before additional household staff could arrive at the scene.After being injured, the actor went to Lilavati Hospital in an auto as no driver was available at that time. The auto driver, who took Saif to the hospital said when he was passing by the Satguru Darshan building where the actor stayed, a woman and a few others asked him to stop the rickshaw.“Then the person whose white kurta was soaked in blood got in the auto. I noticed he had neck and back injuries, but did not notice the hand injury,” he said.“He (Saif) walked into the auto. There was a seven-eight year old boy who also boarded the rickshaw,” he said, when asked if the actor's son Taimur accompanied him to the hospital.“When we reached the hospital, he called out to the guard at the gate and told him: Please bring a stretcher. I am Saif Ali Khan,” he said, adding the auto reached the hospital around 3 am.Later, Saif met driver Bhajan Singh Rana to thank him for his timely help and offered him financial support.Initially, the Mumbai Police picked up a carpenter who had worked at Saif Ali Khan's flat two days before the stabbing incident. How was, however, let go the same day. Two days later, a man was held in Chhattisgarh and brought to Mumbai for questioning. Police later said he was just a suspect and later released.After a three-day manhunt, Mohammad Shariful Islam Shehzad was arrested and sent to five-day police custody by the court. According to police, Shehzad, a Bangladesh national, had entered the actor's house intending to commit theft. However, the situation escalated when he was spotted by a house help in the room of Saif's younger son, Jeh.Police said that the accused, who was arrested from Thane on January 19, entered the country illegally seven months ago and used a West Bengal resident's Aadhaar card to procure a SIM before moving to Mumbai.Shehzad gained access to the actor's residence by climbing over the compound wall while the security personnel were asleep, according to police reports. He accessed the premises through the main entrance, which lacked CCTV surveillance, as per a police official's statement.Upon noticing the sleeping security guards, he scaled the boundary wall. The intruder then stored his footwear in his bag to minimise noise and deactivated his mobile phone, the official added.""During the probe, the police found that there are no CCTV cameras installed in the building's corridor. The investigation revealed that one of the two security guards was sleeping in the cabin and the other near the gate,"" an official said.Initially, there were questions regarding Saif's spouse, actress Kareena Kapoor Khan's location during the incident. Later, news agency IANS reported that she was inebriated after attending a party at actress Sonam Kapoor 's house.News agency IANS reported that Kareena arrived home heavily intoxicated. Concerns about potential media exposure through leaked photographs and recordings, coupled with questions about her condition at the hospital and police station, influenced her decision to remain private. Following the incident, she sought refuge at her sister Karisma Kapoor's residence.In her statement, Kareena told authorities that while the intruder became violent during the confrontation, he left untouched the exposed jewellery.In her statement, Kareena mentioned that when the attack happened, she sent the children Taimur and Jehangir along with the women to the 12th floor. Saif tried to protect them.When Saif intervened, the attacker couldn't reach their younger son Jahangir, also called Jeh.Kareena told the police that the attacker did not steal anything from the house and was very aggressive. He attacked Saif multiple times.She added that she went to her sister Karisma’s house after the attack. “After the attack, I was terrified, so Karisma took me to her house,” she had said.The actor was finally discharged from the hospital on Tuesday. The actor was seen waving for the cameras as he reached home. The Mumbai Police is providing temporary protection to Saif, Kareena and their two kids - Taimur and Jeh.Meanwhile, the actor has added personal security cover and hired a security firm owned by actor Ronit Roy for the job. The agency workers were seen installing CCTV cameras at Saif's building entrance.Bandra police have finally recovered the final missing section of the knife that broke during the assault. The suspect had disposed of it near Bandra Talao on SV Road, approximately 1.4km from the actor's home.""A three-inch piece of the knife which got stuck inside Saif's back was recovered after it was removed during the surgery. The second small piece with blood on it was found in his house during the panchnama carried out after the crime. The final big portion with the handle was found near the talao,"" stated a Bandra police station officer.The police also took the accused to recreate the crime scene at Saif's residence. ""He showed us where he had disposed of the knife after walking 1.4km (around 25 minutes) from Saif's building. After discarding the knife, he walked 650 metres to a restaurant on Linking Road before proceeding to the bus stop outside National College where he slept. In the morning he walked to Bandra railway station to catch a train for Dadar at 8 am before heading to Worli and then to Thane,"" explained a police officer.The investigation team has obtained Fakir's clothing worn during and after the incident. ""We have recovered the shirt and cap that Fakir wore as mentioned by Saif's stay-at-home nurse, Eliyamma Phillip, in her complaint. The team also found the scarf and all pieces of the knife. The recovered material will be sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory. Fakir had stolen the knife from the Thane restaurant where he worked,"" the officer concluded.Since the day of the attack, several questions have been raised regarding the stabbing incident. Questions have been raised regarding the attack being an inside job. It is said that the door was kept open for the suspect by someone already present at the home. Police, however, have found no proof of forced entry inside the house.In the latest, Maharashtra cabinet minister Nitesh Rane has raised questions about if the attack was real. Rane said, ""The way Saif came out of the hospital, I am wondering if he was really attacked or is he acting.""Meanwhile, police, while seeking custody of the accused, had also cited an international conspiracy angle in the court. Police told court that the alleged attacker was a Bangladeshi national and there was a need to find the motive behind his act. Police also told the court that they needed to find out if there was an international conspiracy linked to the case.","Saif Ali Khan was stabbed on January 16 at his 12th-floor apartment in the upscale Bandra area in Mumbai.

""Initial investigations have found that the deaths have not been caused due to infection, viral or bacterial. They have been caused by toxins. Tests are on to identify the type of toxin,"" Singh said. He added that suitable action will be taken if it is found that the toxicity was caused due to some mischief or malaise.Dr Sudhir Gupta, professor and head of forensic medicine and toxicology at AIIMS said that toxins can be both natural and chemical. ""Detailed testing will be required to identify what type of toxin caused the deaths. It could be some insecticide, pesticide or even gases,"" he said.As many as 17 people, all of them belonging to three families residing in Badhal village in Rajouri district, have died since Dec 7. At least five others, including two children, are in critical condition after suffering from symptoms suggestive of neuro-toxicity or damage to the brain and the nervous system after exposure to certain toxins. ""The symptoms aren't suggestive of any infection. It looks like a case of poisoning, but we shouldn't conclude anything until the investigation is completed,"" one of the doctors at GMC, Jammu where three symptomatic individuals including two children are admitted, said.He said the affected children suffer from bouts of irritability, drowsiness, profuse sweating followed by respiratory distress. ""We have put one child on ventilator support. Her condition is critical. The other one is doing slightly better,"" the doctor, who did not want to be identified, said.Meanwhile, the residents of Badhal village in Rajouri district remain gripped by shock and fear. The fear was intensified when four more individuals from Badhal were hospitalised due to a mysterious illness and the district administration on late Wednesday evening relocated several families who had been in close contact with the deceased or sick to an isolation centre.An official said that around 40 people were transferred to the isolation centre established at the Govt Nursing College in Rajouri. "" Authorities have made arrangements to accommodate up to 100 people at the centre.""According to an order issued by District Magistrate (DM) Rajouri, a comprehensive surveillance plan has been implemented, with different departments directed to make arrangements for the people at the centre.

BENGALURU: Amid growing speculation about a possible leadership change in Karnataka, chief minister Siddaramaiah Thursday indicated for the first time an arrangement between him and his deputy, DK Shivakumar , to take turns as CM.""Ultimately, high command will take a decision (on leadership change) or regarding everything,"" he told reporters in response to a question on leadership change.This signals a significant shift from Siddaramaiah's statements so far, where he had doubled down on completing a five-year tenure. Shivakumar had recently said he would ""perform his duty""; any decision on leadership rests with the party.Siddaramaiah’s statement Thursday stems from a 50-50 power-sharing formula that was widely talked about soon after Congress scored a big win in 2023 assembly polls. At that time, Shivakumar had pushed for the chief minister’s post, prompting the party to intervene and reportedly propose a 30-month power-sharing arrangement.Siddaramaiah is set to complete 30 months in office by year-end. Supporters of two front-runners — Shivakumar and public works minister Satish Jarkiholi — have been organising special rituals in temples to pray for their respective candidates to secure the chief ministership.About the feud between the camps, Siddaramaiah said, “Ultimately high command will take a call.” He also addressed BJP’s allegations of misuse of funds allocated for SC/ST welfare programmes.BJP state president BY Vijayendra had accused Congress govt of misappropriating funds and failing to address concerns of these communities. The CM dismissed the charges as “politically motivated”.","Siddaramaiah indicated for the first time an arrangement between him and his deputy, DK Shivakumar, to take turns as CM.

‘Saif’s critical med details not in 1st hosp report so no murder bid in FIR’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/saifs-critical-med-details-not-in-1st-hosp-report-so-no-murder-bid-in-fir/articleshow/117497706.cms,"Mumbai: The assault charges filed by Bandra police on Shariful Fakir , actor Saif Ali Khan 's attacker, has triggered another round of debate.In the wee hours of Jan 16, Shariful broke into Khan's Bandra home and repeatedly stabbed him — leaving behind a 2.5-inch knife tip in a wound near his mid spine that oozed spinal fluid.While legal experts said that an attempt to murder charge could have been added given the extent of the back wound, police said their charges reflected the medico-legal case report filed by Lilavati Hospital doctors soon after Khan entered the casualty in his bloodied clothes.The hospital report filed at 4.11am — almost an hour after the actor's arrival — states multiple lacerations and abrasions and has no mention of the deep wound in his mid-spine region that necessitated an emergency operation.A senior police officer said, ""The severity of injuries alone doesn't justify an attempt-to-murder charge. The intent is paramount.""The FIR, based on the initial scene examination and Lilavati Hospital's medico-legal case, has been filed for attempted robbery. Bandra police later added charges of grievous injury, armed robbery attempt and house trespassing after further investigation. As Shariful is a Bangladeshi national staying here illegally, police have since added provisions under the Foreigners Act, 1946 and the Foreigners Order, 1948.A senior police officer said the omission of critical medical details has complicated the case. ""The injuries mentioned in the report were deemed insufficient to invoke Section 109 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), which deals with attempted murder,"" he said. To apply this stringent charge, police must assess the offender's intent, the nature of injuries and the criminal history.In public hospitals, where medico-legal case reports are regularly filed, the initial report is almost always followed by a detailed report by surgeon or treating doctor. ""However, we send the surgeon's report only after police seek an updated report,"" a doctor said, adding that police more often than not ask for such a follow-up report within 24 hours of the patient's admission. The initial report is filled in the casualty, and mostly includes observations. ""Reports of detailed scans or blood reports are not available at this time,"" said the doctor.It is learnt that police are awaiting further evidence and analysis before adding Section 109 (attempt to murder), if at all. If invoked, the section carries a maximum punishment of 10 years' jail.Meanwhile, Khan is recovering under medical care, and his legal team is reportedly preparing to pursue stricter charges against the accused.",Shariful Fakir broke into Saif Ali Khan's Bandra home and repeatedly stabbed him.

Saif said his family members and staff were frightened upon encountering the armed assailant. He rushed towards the intruder to protect his son and the staff. According to his statement, Saif and his wife Kareena were in their bedroom, while his son Taimur was in another room with a nurse. His younger son Jehangir was in a separate bedroom with staff nurse Eliyamma Phillip and a domestic helper when Phillip noticed the intruder.A police officer said: ""Saif said he and Kareena came out of the bedroom on hearing Phillip's scream and Jehangir crying.

During the re-enactment, Shariful demonstrated to the police team his entry method: scaling a 4-ft wall to enter Satguru Sharan premises, using a ladder to climb 12ft to access the duct, reaching the fourth floor where he cut the rat mesh with a knife. He then used the staircase to reach the 10th floor, from where he climbed through the duct pipe to enter the bathroom in Khan's 11th floor flat.

Similar accident claimed 22 lives in Mumbai 31 years ago

NAHSIK: It was smoke that perhaps sparked rumours of a fire, which caused panicked passengers to jump out of Pushpak Express, only to be crushed under the wheels of the oncoming Karnataka Express on the adjoining track, said survivors and passengers of the Lucknow-Mumbai train who were witness to the tragedy that took place near Pachora station in Maharashtra’s Jalgaon district.The unreserved coaches of the train were packed to the hilt, and chaos ensued as soon as the train stopped. Jagmohan Paswan, a 48-year-old survivor, said: “There were many vendors in our coach. One of them shouted that a fire had broken out in a coach. Seconds later, the train stopped and everyone came rushing to squeeze out of the two doors. My relative, Uttam Paswan, too, jumped out and sustained head & leg injuries.”Paswan said those killed and injured had jumped out of the door on the right side of the coach. Uttam was among them, but survived, he said, adding those who exited from the left door, including himself, were unharmed.Sanjeev Singh, who was on his way to Shirdi, said: “We were sitting when suddenly people started screaming about a fire. There was some smoke emanating, but not from a fire. However, this caused chaos, and a few seconds later, the train pulled to a stop. I went to the door and saw people jumping out and coming under the train on the next track. I saw eight to ten bodies on the other track.”“Our coach was intact and people in AC coaches were mostly safe. I am not sure if the smoke was from pantry or braking,” he said.Md Mulin (42), whose relative Md Bilal sustained injuries in the right leg, said there was hardly any space in the coach they were travelling in. “Even the doors were blocked by passengers standing there. Suddenly, everyone rushed towards the doors.” Recounting the heart-rending sight before him on jumping out, he said: “I saw dismembered bodies on the adjacent track. I will not forget what I witnessed.”According to some survivors, the loco pilot of Karnataka Express stopped the train after seeing passengers from Pushpak Express jumping out. Had it not stopped, the toll would have been higher, they said.

A post on X has gone viral, claiming that a friend of Jennifer Aniston said everyone close to her knows that she is dating former president Barack Obama . ""He's with Jennifer Aniston.

He wrote: “Elon Musk is being falsely smeared. Elon is a great friend of Israel. He visited Israel after the October 7 massacre in which Hamas terrorists committed the worst atrocity against the Jewish people since the Holocaust.” He added: “He has since repeatedly and forcefully supported Israel’s right to defend itself against genocidal terrorists and regimes who seek to annihilate the one and only Jewish state. I thank him for this.”Earlier, Elon Musk's ex defended him. The Canadian singer and mother of Tesla CEO Elon Musk's three children, namely Grimes, has recently and publicly denounced Nazism following Elon Musk's controversial salute during the inauguration of US President Donald Trump, which many likened to a Nazi gesture.Grimes, in her post on X (formerly known as Twitter), expressed her discontent with the backlash she faced for the actions of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, stating that she was completely unaware of the incident until it had already occurred. She also emphasized her desire to distance herself from Elon Musk's controversies, asserting that 'I am not him' and criticizing the notion that she should be held accountable for his actions.In response, Musk dismissed the allegations, calling them baseless and stating that the gesture was taken out of context. While some organizations suggested the action was not intentional, others described it as highly inappropriate and reminiscent of fascist symbolism.The incident had significant repercussions on social media, with several communities banning links to Musk's platform, X (formerly Twitter), citing concerns over the spread of extremist content. This reflected growing dissatisfaction with Musk's perceived alignment with far-right ideologies .Reactions to the incident varied globally. Some defended Musk, citing his support for certain causes, while others condemned him, urging him to educate himself on the historical implications of his actions.The controversy also escalated into a dispute between Musk and Wikipedia after the platform documented the incident, with Musk accusing Wikipedia of bias and propaganda.

It was not easy for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to hide their feelings as thousands of cameras flashed on them as Donald Trump was sworn in as the 47th president of the United States after a bitterly fought election. Donald Trump had to fight both of them as Joe Biden was initially the presidential candidate until he was forced t0 bow out in favor of Kamala Harris. Trump debated both of them in two presidential debates in the blitzkrieg campaign.Biden and Kamala Harris, however, showed courtesy as they handed over the power to Donald Trump and JD Vance, respectively. Biden in fact greeted Donald Trump saying 'Welcome home'.Body language experts, however, decoded what they were suppressing as Donald Trump took the oath. Expert Susan Constantine told Newsweek that Kamala Harris' face was tense as she seemed uncomfortable. ""The body language between Trump, Harris, and Biden was contentious, stonewalling one another intentionally not to acknowledge or show respect through eye contact, eyebrow glance, or handshake,"" Constantine said.""Harris's face was tense, as she seemed uncomfortable, and she was leaning away from Biden. She appeared to hug the chair to create further distance between her and Biden. Biden appeared lost in space,"" the expert said adding that Kamala Harris displayed visible signs of deep emotion throughout the inauguration. She took a deep breath and looked tense.Body language expert Blanca Cobb noted that during Donald Trump's inauguration speech, Biden and Harris did not clap. ""Their body language spoke volumes: Harris maintained a sharp, unwavering stare, her arms crossed on her lap, a posture that conveyed disapproval and restrained tension. Meanwhile, Biden's subtle smirk added a layer of quiet disagreement,"" he said.According to a lip reader, Barack Obama asked George W Bush how they could ""stop what's happening"" during the inauguration. Lip reader Jackie Gonzalez interpreted that Obama greeted Bush and said, ""Good to see you"". Obama then turned to the crowd thanking them for the cheers and asked Bush, ""How can we stop what's happening?""There was another viral moment from the inauguration when Donald Trump's son Barron Trump leaned towards Joe Biden after a handshake. Forensic lip reader Jeremy Freeman said he believes Biden said, ""It's good to see you man"" to which Barron said, ""Exactly"".","Body language experts have decoded the body language of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris at the inauguration event of Donald Trump.

Trump Dials Putin? Russian President Cuts Short Strategic Meet For 'Important International Call'

Poll What Do You Think About Pregnant Women Opting for Preterm C-Sections Due to Citizenship Concerns? A Risky Decision for Both Mother and Child A Desperate Measure for Stability

HYDERABAD: C-section in the US has a new trigger: citizenship pangs.At a maternity clinic in New Jersey, Dr S D Rama has been fielding an unusually high number of requests for pre-term delivery since President Donald Trump’s Jan 20 proclamation about termination of birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment.The majority of those dialling Rama or queuing up at her clinic are Indian women in their eighth or ninth month of pregnancy, all asking for C-sections to be scheduled before Feb 20. A few are still a couple of months away from full term.Also read: Russia dismisses Trump's sanctions ultimatum as 'nothing new', open to 'mutually respectful' talks “A seven months pregnant woman came with her husband to sign up for a preterm delivery. She isn’t due until sometime in March,” Rama told TOI from New Jersey on Wednesday.The desperation to beat the birthright citizenship deadline — babies born Feb 20 onwards to those who aren’t permanent residents won’t be automatically entitled to citizenship — is apparently widespread.“I am trying to tell couples that even if it is possible, a preterm birth poses significant risk to mother and child. Complications include underdeveloped lungs, feeding problems, low birth weight, neurological complications and more,” said Dr S G Mukkala, an obstetrician and gynaecologist in Texas. “In the past two days, I have spoken to 15 to 20 couples regarding this.”With the backlog for green cards stretching to over a century now, birthright citizenship was a safety net for many expectant couples, especially Indians working in the US.“We were counting on our child being born here,” said Varun, who along with his wife Priya (names changed) moved to the US eight years ago on H-1B visas. “We’ve been waiting for our green cards for six years. This was the only way to ensure stability for our family. We are terrified of the uncertainty.” Priya, 34, is due to give birth in early March.A 28-year-old finance professional said his plans would go haywire if his dependant wife were to give birth to their first child after the deadline. “We sacrificed so much to come here. Now, it feels like the door is closing on us,” the H-1B holder said, still a few months away from parenthood.For illegal immigrants, the change in policy has even stronger ramifications.California-based Vijay (name changed), who has been living in the US for eight years since entering the country illegally, said he and his seven months pregnant wife were “crushed” by the news of the Trump administration enforcing the deadline so soon. “We thought of seeking asylum, but then my wife got pregnant and our lawyer suggested that we get direct citizenship through our child. Now, we are all at sea.”","President Donald Trump's Jan 20 proclamation about termination of birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment.

What happened on November 22, 1963?



What are the documents that are still classified?



US President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced that he will ""immediately"" released the classified documents related to the assassinations of President Kennedy and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.“I’m going to release them immediately. We’re going to see the information. We are looking at it right now,” Trump said in an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity.Trump, who sworn-in as the 47th President on Monday, recalled his previous term could not release some documents related to Kennedy’s 1963 assassination, bowing to pressure from the intelligence community who urged Trump to keep the information under wraps citing national security concerns.Trump said Wednesday that Mike Pompeo who served as CIA director and, later, Secretary of State was among those who urged him to keep some files classified.“He (Mike Pompeo) felt it was just not a good time to release them,” Trump said.It has been over the six decades after President John F Kennedy 's assassination, but still the speculation persists, and any additional information about November 22, 1963, in Dallas continues to draw public interest.Currently, only a small fraction of the millions of government documents concerning the assassination remain unreleased. Researchers who have examined the available records suggest that the eventual release of remaining files is unlikely to produce significant discoveries.During his first term, Trump initially promised complete disclosure but subsequently retained certain documents, citing national security concerns. The Biden administration has continued releasing files, though some remain classified.Recent releases have revealed intelligence operations of the era, including CIA communications about Oswald's visits to Soviet and Cuban embassies in Mexico City shortly before the assassination. Oswald, a former Marine, had previously defected to the Soviet Union before returning to Texas.National security lawyer Mark S Zaid noted that released documents have enhanced understanding of Cold War dynamics and CIA operations during that period.The Kennedys arrived in Dallas to clear skies and welcoming crowds on Air Force One. The visit was part of a political reconciliation effort in Texas, with re-election campaigns approaching the following year.The motorcade route through downtown ended tragically when gunfire erupted from the Texas School Book Depository building. Authorities apprehended Oswald, aged 24, and two days afterwards, Jack Ruby fatally shot Oswald during his prison transfer.The Warren Commission, established by President Lyndon B Johnson, concluded their investigation a year later, determining that Oswald acted independently without evidence of conspiracy. Nevertheless, various alternative theories have persisted throughout the decades.In the early 1990s, legislation required all assassination-related materials to be consolidated at the National Archives and Records Administration. This collection, containing over 5 million records, was scheduled for release by 2017, subject to presidential exemptions.Approximately 3,000 to 4,000 documents remain partially or fully classified. About 500 documents are completely withheld, including tax records for Oswald and Ruby, which were exempt from the 2017 disclosure requirement.The Sixth Floor Museum curator Stephen Fagin observes that public scepticism about the lone gunman theory existed from the beginning, though law enforcement built a strong case against Oswald.Larry J. Sabato, who developed interest in the case as a child, acknowledged that while the idea of a single disturbed individual committing such a momentous crime seemed improbable, his research suggested it as a likely scenario.","Trump said Wednesday that Mike Pompeo who served as CIA director and, later, Secretary of State was among those who urged him to keep some files classified. “He (Mike Pompeo) felt it was just not a good time to release them,” Trump said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117474937,imgsize-23898,width-400,resizemode-4/117474937.jpg"

A DailyMail report Wednesday claimed that Kamala Harris has started mulling whether Doug Emhoff is an asset or a liability as the former vice president now thinks that the allegations against Doug Emhoff, including cheating on his first wife with the nanny, came in the way of Kamala Harris' presidential campaign. The report said Kamala Harris has already signed up for a job with a Big Apple law firm which would require them to split their time between New York and San Francisco.The report said that fresh out of the office, Kamala Harris is now ready for a blame game and ""her target has flipped to her dead weight husband"".""But now that Harris has been defeated, she's reportedly looking to undergo a complete image overhaul to resuscitate her floundering political career -- maybe at the expense of Emhoff,"" DailyMail reported.A series of allegations surfaced against Emhoff which Emhoff's office rejected except the cheating one. Emhoff had an affair with his daughter's nanny that also resulted in a pregnancy and a subsequent miscarriage. This affair ended Emhoff's first marriage with Kerstin Emhoff who was also part of Kamala Harris' campaign. DaolyMail reported that Emhoff paid the nanny $80,000 in exchange for her signing a non-disclosure agreement.Then DailyMail reported that a former girlfriend alleged that she was slapped hard in the face by Emhoff who thought she was flirting with another man. This incident apparently took place in Cannes, France in 2012. This was followed by allegations from Emhoff's former colleagues who called him a misogynist.Emhoff rubbished all the allegations except the troubles in his first marriage. ""During my first marriage, Kerstin and I went through some tough times on account of my actions. I took responsibility, and in the years since, we worked through things as a family and have come out stronger on the other side,"" Emhoff said.All this affected Kamala Harris' campaign though she put on a brace face during that time but now she has everything to be fixed, an ally said adding that she would probably skip the California governor France in 2026 and she thinks it is a thankless job and will instead try for the presidential election again in 2028.","Kamala Harris is mulling whether Doug Emhoff is an asset or a liability, a Daily Mail report said.

Recently, many activists from the UBT faction and other parties switched loyalties to Sena after they were convinced that we will never compromise on Hindutva and Balasaheb’s ideologies for the sake of power.

Balasaheb believed in 80% social work and 20% politics and said every political worker must be active on the field and not operating from the confines of his home,” Shinde said while making a veiled attack on his former boss and UBT Chief Uddhav Thackeray.“Our opponents always cried foul after our Mahayuti govt was formed and always criticised us, claiming the junta would deliver justice. However, our landslide victory in the recent assembly polls silenced them… Our responsibility has increased manifold, and we will continue to strive for the welfare of Maharashtra and its residents,” he said.He further warned the UBT leaders saying that if they continued criticising his party and the Mahayuti, then the faction could be left with only two out of the present 20 MLAs.Meanwhile, political experts said the Sena expansion plans could be seen as an attempt by the party to match pace with the BJP using the Hindutva card on the national front.",Shinde was addressing the media Thursday afternoon in Thane on the occasion of Thackeray’s birth anniversary.

Rep. Andy Ogles , a Tennessee Republican, introduced a resolution on Thursday to amend the US Constitution to allow President Donald Trump and any future president to be elected to a third term.""No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than three times, nor be elected to any additional term after being elected to two consecutive terms, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice,"" read the language of the proposed amendment, according to a press release available on Congressman Ogles website, which also explained his reasoning.Ogles stated that Trump ""has proven himself to be the only figure in modern history capable of reversing our nation’s decay and restoring America to greatness, and he must be given the time necessary to accomplish that goal.""The resolution comes just days after Trump was sworn in for a second, non-consecutive term, becoming only the second US president to achieve this feat. It also follows a resolution introduced two months ago by Rep. Dan Goldman, a New York Democrat, reaffirming that the 22nd Amendment applies to two terms in the aggregate as President of the United States and applies to the 78-year-old Trump.""It is imperative that we provide President Trump with every resource necessary to correct the disastrous course set by the Biden administration,"" Ogles said in a statement. ""He is dedicated to restoring the republic and saving our country, and we, as legislators and as states, must do everything in our power to support him.""The 22nd Amendment currently states, ""No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.""Trump has repeatedly hinted at his willingness to serve more than two terms in office. In November, he reportedly mused to House Republicans, ""I suspect I won't be running again, unless you say, 'He's so good we've got to figure something else out.'"" In May, he had said, ""I don't know, are we going to be considered three-term or two-term? Are we three-term or two-term if we win?""The former Fox News journalist Geraldo Rivera, who was friendly with Trump for decades in New York, predicted in December that Trump and his allies would soon turn their attention to the 22nd Amendment.Amending the Constitution is not the only way Trump could stay in power after his current term ends. According to Philip Klinkner, a professor of government at Hamilton College, the 22nd Amendment only prohibits someone from being ""elected"" more than twice and does not prohibit them from serving as president beyond January 2029.Klinkner suggested hypothetical scenarios, such as Trump running for vice president in 2028 with Vice President JD Vance running for president. If elected, Vance could resign, making Trump president again. Alternatively, under the 25th Amendment, if a president declares that ""he is unable to discharge the powers and duties of the office,"" the vice president would serve as acting president.Another scenario involves Trump encouraging a family member to run for and win the White House, serving as a figurehead president while Trump makes key decisions.","Rep.

A blaze in La Jolla, near the University of California, prompted temporary evacuations before being brought under control.Another fire near the US-Mexico border spread rapidly through the Otay Mountain Wilderness, home to endangered species like the Quino checkerspot butterfly.Rainfall, which is forecasted for the weekend, has ignited hopes of relief from the months-long dry spell.“We had helicopters dropping water until around 3 a.m., which kept the fire in check,” said fire spokesperson Jeremy Ruiz.While nearly 54,000 residents in the Castaic area remain under evacuation warnings, no homes or structures have been reported damaged.Among those affected was Kayla Amara, a nurse from Valencia. She rushed to a friend’s home in Castaic’s Stonegate neighbourhood to retrieve belongings but found herself hosing down the property as the fire grew.“It’s been stressful with those other fires, but now that this one is close to home it’s just super stressful,” she said.The Palisades Fire is now almost 75 per cent contained, while Eaton Fire is 95 per cent under control. These two devastating blazes, which began earlier this month, have claimed 28 lives and destroyed more than 14,000 structures.California officials are preparing for potential debris flows as rain approaches, particularly in the Pacific Palisades and Altadena areas, where damage is extensive.Statewide, the fires have caused an estimated $28 billion in insured damage, with additional losses likely uninsured, according to disaster modelling firm Karen Clark and Company.In response, the California Legislature approved a $2.5 billion fire relief package on Thursday to assist recovery efforts in Los Angeles and other affected areas.President Donald Trump is set to visit the state on Friday to assess the damage, though it remains unclear whether he will meet with Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom during the trip.","The Hughes Fire, which erupted near Castaic Lake on Wednesday, quickly engulfed a vast green patch of almost 41 square kilometres of trees and brush.

'You can't have it for the rest of your life': Donald Trump withdraws security for Mike Pompeo and Brian Hook amid ongoing threats from Iran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/you-cant-have-it-for-the-rest-of-your-life-donald-trump-withdraws-security-for-mike-pompeo-and-brian-hook-amid-ongoing-threats-from-iran/articleshow/117502993.cms,"Why Security threats removed?



US President Donald Trump withdrew security protection for Mike Pompeo , who had served as the secretary of state during his first tenure, and a former top aide, Brian Hook , despite the previous administrations warned about the ongoing Iranian threats related to their actions during Trump's tenure.Pompeo and Brian Hook, who maintained an assertive stance against Iran during Trump's first presidency, were involved in key decisions including the drone strike that eliminated Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in early 2020, AP reported citing sources.Trump himself faced continued threats due to Soleimani's elimination. His advisers have emphasised the gravity of the situation during his time between presidencies. He sought additional protection, including military resources during his campaign's final months, due to Iranian threats - protection typically limited to sitting presidents.When questioned about withdrawing security details, Trump stated: ""When you have protection, you can't have it for the rest of your life."" He added, ""I mean, there's risks to everything.""Iranian threats remain a serious security concern. In autumn 2024, Joe Biden's administration warned Iran that assassinating former US officials would be considered an act of war. Post-November election, authorities charged an individual allegedly recruited by Iran for a plot against Trump.Both Pompeo and Hook, along with Bolton, were granted security details by the Biden administration due to ongoing threats. According to The New York Times, the outgoing administration briefed Trump on the status of these threats.Trump's first administration took an aggressive approach on Iran which included withdrawing from the Iran Deal, Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), in 2018, various sanctions, labeling Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a foreign terrorist organization, and the killing of Soleimani, among others, Newsweek reported.The motivation for removing Pompeo and Hook's security remains unclear, given their general support. Pompeo endorsed Trump in 2024 despite brief presidential aspirations and minimal criticism.Trump recently stated on Fox News that Pompeo influenced his decision not to release Kennedy assassination files during his first term, puzzling those familiar with Pompeo. Trump has indicated he won't employ former Pompeo staff, recently removing Hook from the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.","US President Donald Trump withdrew security protection for Mike Pompeo and a former top aide, Brian Hook.

WASHINGTON: President Trump on Wednesday threatened to withhold federal disaster aid for wildfire-ravaged Los Angeles unless California changes the state’s approach on its management of water.In a Fox News interview, Trump repeated false claims that the state’s fish conservation efforts in the northern part of the state are responsible for fire hydrants running dry in urban areas. He says the blame for Los Angeles’ struggles to tame some of the deadly fires lies with Democratic governor Gavin Newsom, a political foe who has called for partnership and mutual respect as the state fights the blazes.“I don’t think we should give California anything until they let the water run down,” Trump said. The president levelled the threat as he prepares for the first presidential trip of his second term. On Friday, he will visit southern California in addition to western North Carolina, which is recovering after Hurricane Helene pummeled the area more than three months ago.",President Trump on Wednesday threatened to withhold federal disaster aid for wildfire-ravaged Los Angeles.

A bombshell apology

The closest a royal has come to a trial

A personal crusade

What’s next?

In a rare and extraordinary move, Rupert Murdoch ’s News Group Newspapers (NGN) publicly apologized to Prince Harry for years of privacy violations , including phone hacking , surveillance, and misuse of personal information. The settlement, announced Wednesday in London’s High Court, comes with a substantial, undisclosed payout to the Duke of Sussex.The apology marked the first time NGN admitted wrongdoing at The Sun, a tabloid infamous for its sensationalism. Prince Harry’s lawyer, David Sherborne, read the settlement statement in court, which detailed “serious intrusion” into Harry’s life by private investigators working for The Sun between 1996 and 2011.The apology also extended to Harry’s late mother, Princess Diana , acknowledging the tabloid’s role in intruding into her life—an admission that carried emotional weight for the prince, who has long blamed the media for her tragic death in 1997.“We acknowledge and apologize for the distress caused to the duke, and the damage inflicted on relationships, friendships, and family,” the statement read.The settlement came just as Harry’s case was about to begin—a trial that could have brought NGN’s practices under unprecedented scrutiny. His case against The Sun and the now-defunct News of the World was the culmination of years of legal battles, with Harry being one of the few claimants refusing to settle quietly.This was not Harry’s first legal victory against the British tabloids. In 2023, a judge ruled that phone hacking was “widespread and habitual” at the Daily Mirror, making Harry the first senior royal to testify in court since the 19th century.Harry’s animosity toward the press is deeply personal. He has accused the media of contributing to his mother’s death and relentlessly attacking his wife, Meghan Markle, which he says forced the couple to leave royal life in 2020.The settlement also exposed fractures within the royal family. Harry revealed in court papers that his father, King Charles III, opposed his lawsuit, and his brother, Prince William, had privately settled a similar case with NGN for over £1 million.“I’m doing this for my reasons,” Harry said in the documentary Tabloids on Trial, lamenting that his family did not join him in his fight against the press.While this case has reached its conclusion, Harry is not done. Another lawsuit, this time against the publisher of the Daily Mail, is set for trial in 2025, promising yet another chapter in his battle for privacy.The apology and settlement signal a turning point in the long-standing feud between the Duke of Sussex and Britain’s tabloid industry—a feud that continues to shape his life, his family, and his legacy.","News Group Newspapers (NGN) publicly apologized to Prince Harry for years of privacy violations.

The Senate voted to advance the nomination of Pete Hegseth , President Donald Trump 's choice for Defense Secretary , in a closely contested test vote on Thursday. The vote to end debate narrowly passed with 51 Republican votes, despite opposition from two GOP senators, Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins .A final confirmation vote on Hegseth's nomination could take place as early as Friday or Saturday, according to ABC News. The procedural vote came after the Senate Armed Services Committee advanced Hegseth's nomination in a 14-13 party-line vote earlier this week.Murkowski, who announced her opposition moments before the vote, cited concerns about Hegseth's preparedness to lead the Pentagon and his past statements regarding women in the military. She also referenced allegations of sexual misconduct and excessive drinking against Hegseth, which he has largely denied.""After thorough evaluation, I must conclude that I cannot in good conscience support his nomination for Secretary of Defense,"" Murkowski said in a post on X. ""I did not make this decision lightly; I take my constitutional responsibility to provide advice and consent with the utmost seriousness.""""The past behaviors Mr. Hegseth has admitted to, including infidelity on multiple occasions, demonstrate a lack of judgment that is unbecoming of someone who would lead our armed forces,"" she added. ""These behaviors starkly contrast the values and discipline expected of servicemembers.""Collins also expressed reservations about Hegseth's views on women in the military and his overall experience. ""While I appreciate his courageous military service and his ongoing commitment to our servicemembers and their families, I am concerned that he does not have the experience and perspective necessary to succeed in the job,"" she said in a statement.Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker endorsed Hegseth in a floor speech, calling him the ""right man for the job."" However, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticised the nomination, questioning if Hegseth is the best choice to lead the military. ""Is this the best man we have to lead the greatest military in the world?"" Schumer asked, pointing to the allegations against Hegseth and questioning his reliability in a crisis situation.The vote on Hegseth's nomination followed the Senate's confirmation of John Ratcliffe as CIA director, who became Trump's second confirmed Cabinet official with a 74-25 vote.","Pete Hegseth is President Donald Trump's choice for Defense Secretary.

WASHINGTON: The House on Wednesday gave final approval to a bill that would require the detention and deportation of migrants who enter the country without authorisation and are charged with certain crimes, making it the first bill to clear the new Congress and head to President Donald Trump's desk for his signature.The final vote, 263-156, capped the opening salvo in a broader Trump-era crackdown on immigration and migrants in the country illegally that the president has promised, Republicans have championed, and a small but increasing group of Democrats has begun to embrace. Forty-six Democrats joined all Republicans in backing it, a sign of the growing cross-party consensus around taking a harder line against those who enter the US illegally.The bill is all but certain to be quickly signed by Trump, who on Monday started his second term by issuing a raft of executive orders that kicked off his immigration crackdown, clamping down on both legal and illegal entries into the US. Wednesday's measure, titled Laken Riley Act, is named for a Georgia nursing student (22) who was killed last year by a migrant from Venezuela who crossed into the US illegally. The man had previously been arrested in a shoplifting case but had not been detained.The House gave its blessing after the Senate spent last week debating changes to the bill, exposing deep divisions among Democrats over immigration. Some Democrats have moved to the right on the issue after their party's electoral losses in Nov, arguing that they must embrace basic steps to punish unlawfulness, even if they disagree with some of the details. But others pushed back forcefully on the bill, saying it would deprive accused criminals of due process, a fundamental principle of the criminal justice system, and was aimed mostly at demonising immigrants.The act instructs federal officials to detain immigrants lacking permanent legal status arrested for or charged with burglary, theft, larceny, shoplifting, assaulting a police officer, or crimes that result in death or serious bodily injury, expanding the list of charges that would subject migrants to immediate detention and potential deportation.","Bill would require detention and deportation of migrants who enter the country without authorisation and are charged with certain crimes.

The Senate confirmed John Ratcliffe as CIA director on Thursday, making him President Donald Trump 's second successful cabinet appointment.Ratcliffe, a former director of national intelligence and a Texas Republican, is the first person to have held both positions.At his Senate hearing last week, Ratcliffe emphasised the need for the CIA to improve its use of technology, such as artificial intelligence, to confront adversaries like Russia and China while also ensuring the protection of Americans' civil rights. He pledged to push the agency to harness technologies like AI and quantum computing and expand the use of human intelligence collection.""We're not where we're supposed to be,"" Ratcliffe told members of the Senate Intelligence Committee.Despite concerns raised by some Democrats about Ratcliffe's ability to lead the CIA objectively, the Senate voted 74-25 to confirm him, with many Democrats voting against the nomination. Republicans praised his experience and expressed eagerness to confirm the rest of Trump's national security nominees.Ratcliffe was sworn into office shortly after winning Senate confirmation. The CIA director position has not always been part of the president's Cabinet, but President Joe Biden elevated it to Cabinet level under Ratcliffe's predecessor, William Burns, and Trump's White House lists Ratcliffe as a Cabinet member.Trump and other Republicans have criticised the work of the CIA and other spy agencies, arguing that they have focused too much on issues like climate change and workforce diversity. The calls for a broad overhaul have worried some current and former intelligence officials, who say the changes could make the country less safe.Ratcliffe has identified China as America's greatest geopolitical rival and also noted that Russia, Iran, North Korea, drug cartels, hacking gangs, and terrorist organisations pose challenges to national security. He supports the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , a government spying program that allows authorities to collect the communications of non-Americans outside the country without a warrant, even if they are communicating with Americans.As a Trump loyalist, Ratcliffe defended the president during his first impeachment proceedings and forcefully questioned former special counsel Robert Mueller when he testified before lawmakers about his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. As director of national intelligence, Ratcliffe oversaw and coordinated the work of more than a dozen spy agencies, including efforts to detect and counter foreign influence on US politics.Trump initially picked Ratcliffe for the director of national intelligence position in 2019, but he withdrew from consideration after lawmakers raised questions about his qualifications. He was ultimately confirmed by a sharply divided Senate after Trump resubmitted the nomination.Democrats accused Ratcliffe of politicising intelligence when, as director of national intelligence, he declassified Russian intelligence purporting to reveal information about Democrats during the 2016 election, even as he acknowledged the information might not be accurate. Before Thursday's confirmation vote, Democrats questioned whether Ratcliffe would prioritise loyalty to Trump over the duties of the office, leading to a two-day postponement of the vote.Meanwhile, Trump's second-term nominee for director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard , is expected to face a tougher road to confirmation due to bipartisan criticism over her past comments supportive of Russia and 2017 meetings with then-Syrian President Bashar Assad. Gabbard's confirmation hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee is scheduled for January 30.Ratcliffe's appointment follows Marco Rubio 's appointment as secretary of state earlier in the week.

California governor Gavin Newsom signs $2.5 billion wildfire relief package amid devastating blazes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/california-governor-gavin-newsom-signs-2-5-billion-wildfire-relief-package-amid-devastating-blazes/articleshow/117502400.cms,"California wildfires

California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a $2.5 billion relief package to help the Los Angeles area recover from recent deadly wildfires. The package, approved with bipartisan support by the state Legislature, includes funds for emergency disaster response efforts, streamlining approvals for rebuilding homes, and supporting school districts in rebuilding facilities.The aid was approved a day before President Donald Trump 's scheduled visit to California to assess the damage from the blazes. Despite Trump's suggestion that federal wildfire relief should come with conditions, congressional Republicans representing the state have pushed back on the idea.Newsom initially called lawmakers into a special session in November to prepare for legal battles against Trump's administration. However, after major fires broke out around Los Angeles this month, the governor shifted focus to prioritise fire relief funding under pressure from Republican state lawmakers.Republican state Sen. Kelly Seyarto criticised Newsom for not issuing the fire relief funding on his own but ultimately supported the bills. He called for better collaboration between Democrats and Republicans in crafting legislation for fire response and prevention funding in the future. ""We need a plan from all of us to make sure this doesn't happen again,"" he said.The state Senate also approved $25 million to defend the state against legal challenges by the federal government and another $25 million for legal groups to defend immigrants facing possible deportation and other threats. The state Assembly would still need to pass these bills before they can reach Newsom's desk.The largest of the recent Southern California blazes, which ignited on January 7, ripped through the Pacific Palisades neighborhood in Los Angeles, killing 11 people. The Eaton Fire, which broke out the same day near Altadena, has killed 17 people. The region is also now battling the Hughes Fire, which ignited Wednesday north of Los Angeles, spread more than 15 square miles (39 square kilometers), and led to evacuation orders or warnings for more than 50,000 people.""This is about distilling a sense of hopefulness,"" Newsom said at a news conference in Pasadena, a city recovering from one of the destructive fires that ignited earlier this month.State Senate President Pro Tempore Mike McGuire, a Democrat representing the North Coast, said the fires have been ""nothing short of devastating."" ""But we promise we have your back, and we're going to get through this,"" he said before Newsom signed the aid into law.Newsom's administration expects the state to be reimbursed by the federal government for the disaster relief funding. The governor also announced a commitment by 270 state-chartered banks, credit unions, and lenders to provide mortgage relief to homeowners impacted by fires in Los Angeles and Ventura counties.Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel, a Democrat from Encino and chair of the chamber's special session budget committee, emphasized that the funding passed by the Legislature on Thursday is ""the first of many steps"" lawmakers will take to support wildfire survivors and protect communities from future blazes.The Southern California region is still burning but some progress has been made to contain the blazes. Firefighters made progress containing the Hughes Fire near Castaic Lake, north of Los Angeles, with 25% containment by Thursday.Evacuation orders for tens of thousands were lifted, but new fires erupted in Southern California, including in San Diego and Ventura counties.

The journalists shared their experiences on Palmeri's ""Somebody's Gotta Win"" podcast, shedding light on internal editorial decisions they believe hindered critical reporting.According to a report from Fox News, Caputo, now with Axios, criticised Politico for its handling of the Hunter Biden laptop story during the 2020 presidential election. Speaking about the issue, Caputo said, ""I was covering Biden at the time, and I remember coming to my editor and saying, 'Hey, we need to write about the Hunter Biden laptop.' And I was told this came from on high at Politico: Don't write about the laptop, don't talk about the laptop, don't tweet about the laptop.""Instead, Politico ran a story titled ""Hunter Biden story is Russian disinfo, dozens of former intel officials say,"" which was based on an open letter signed by 51 intelligence officials. The letter claimed the laptop bore ""all the earmarks of a Russian intelligence operation,"" a claim now heavily scrutinised. Caputo described the decision to publish that headline while avoiding broader coverage as ""misinformation, at the least.""Caputo also recalled a 2019 story he wrote about a tax lien related to Hunter Biden's work at the Ukrainian energy company Burisma . Despite completing the piece, he said it was killed by editors without explanation. ""The public doesn't know about those things,"" he noted, referring to the unseen editorial decisions that shape coverage.Palmeri, who now writes for Puck, echoed Caputo's frustrations. She recounted her extensive reporting on a 2018 incident involving Hunter Biden's gun purchase, which eventually led to felony charges for lying about his drug use on a federal form. Palmeri spent three months gathering evidence, including police reports and visits to the Delaware shop where Biden's laptop was left. Despite her thoroughness, she said the process of getting her story published was unusually protracted.""I had to push very hard to get that reporting published."" Palmeri told Fox News Digital. ""It was a constant, 'Hey, when are we going to do this? Hey, when are we going to get this out there?'"" She attributed the delays to a perceived cultural reluctance at Politico to pursue stories that could reflect negatively on the Biden administration. Her report was eventually published in March 2021, two months after Biden’s inauguration.Palmeri also suggested that coverage of a similar story involving the Trump family might have been expedited. ""I just think if it was a Trump kid, it would have been published much sooner,"" she said.","Former Politico reporters Marc Caputo and Tara Palmeri reveal internal editorial decisions hindered critical reporting.

The party of the jailed former leader, Imran Khan , has stopped any further negotiations with the government. They ended these talks because of this new law, which they believe is unfair and harmful.Journalists and media organisations have also expressed deep concern. The Federal Union of Journalists president, Afzal Butt, called the law an attempt to ""suppress the media, social media and journalists.""While the government claims the law is necessary to combat the spread of misinformation and hate speech, critics argue it will be used to silence dissent and control public discourse. This move comes at a time when press freedom in Pakistan is already under increasing pressure. Journalists report facing state pressure, and many media outlets have been instructed to avoid mentioning Imran Khan by name.","Pakistan's lower house of parliament passed a new law on Thursday.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan senators are demanding an apology from billionaire Elon Musk , a lawmaker told AFP on Thursday, accusing him of "" anti-Pakistan propaganda "" as he seeks regulatory approval for his Starlink service in the country.Musk's Starlink satellite internet service has applied for a licence to operate in Pakistan but is awaiting clearance before users will be allowed to log on.A senate committee on information technology and telecommunications met Wednesday to hear updates from officials assessing his application.But committee chair Palwasha Mohammad Zai Khan told AFP ""Several senators denounced"" Musk's ""anti-Pakistani propaganda"" in recent comments he made on his social media platform X.Musk has repeatedly highlighted claims that men of Pakistani origin were responsible for a spate of historic rape cases targeting mostly white girls in England.""It was said that approval should be given on condition of his apology,"" Khan told AFP.""We are not saying it should be a pre-condition but it was a part of the discussion and we can only give our recommendations to the government,"" she added.Musk began launching attacks against the UK government this month after it resisted calls for a national inquiry into the historic abuse cases.In Rotherham, a town of 265,000 inhabitants, a gang drugged, raped and sexually exploited at least 1,400 girls over a 16-year period from 1997, a public inquiry concluded in 2014.A series of court cases eventually led to the conviction of dozens of men, mostly of South Asian origin. The victims were vulnerable, mostly white, girls.An Indian lawmaker made a post on 8 January saying: ""They aren't ASIAN Grooming Gangs but PAKISTANI grooming gangs. Why should Asians take the fall for one absolute rogue nation?""Musk commented with a message saying: ""True"".The historic abuse cases regularly prompt debate in the UK, where some claim they are used to enflame Islamaphobia while others say they are being quashed to prevent debate.Whilst Musk's electric vehicle and space ventures made him a billionaire, he has recently emerged as a political figure affiliated with newly inaugurated President Donald Trump Trump has tasked Musk, the world's richest man, with slashing billions of dollars of federal government spending as head of a new ""department of government efficiency "".","Pakistan senators demand an apology from billionaire Elon Musk.

Pakistani government proposes sweeping controls on social media,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-government-proposes-sweeping-controls-on-social-media/articleshow/117485419.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's opposition said on Thursday the government is seeking to further suppress freedom of speech a day after it proposed sweeping controls on social media that could include blocking platforms and sending users to prison for spreading disinformation. The Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act , introduced in the National Assembly by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar on Wednesday, would create an agency with the power to order ""unlawful and offensive content"" blocked from social media, and to ban individuals and organizations from social mediaSocial media platforms would be required to register with the new Social Media Protection and Regulatory Authority, and those failing to comply with the law could face temporary or permanent bans.The law also makes spreading disinformation a criminal offense, punishable by three years in prison and a fine of 2 million rupees (USD 7,150).The move comes nearly a year after Pakistan blocked the X platform ahead of an election that the opposition party of imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan says was rigged. X is still blocked in the country, although many people use virtual private networks to access it, like in other countries with tight internet controls.Khan has a huge following on social media, especially X, where supporters frequently circulate demands for his release. Khan has been behind bars since 2023, when he was arrested for graft. Khan's party also uses social media to organize demonstrations.The leader of the opposition denounced the proposed legislation, saying it was aimed at further suppressing freedom of speech. Omar Ayub Khan, who is not related to the imprisoned former premier, said the bill could ""lay a foundation for the suppression of voices advocating for constitutional rights"".The new agency would be able to order the immediate blocking of unlawful content targeting judges, the armed forces, parliament or provincial assemblies. The law also forbids uploading remarks from parliament that have been struck from the record.Pakistani media has faced growing censorship in recent years. Journalists have said they face state pressure to avoid using Imran Khan's name, and most TV stations have begun referring to him only as the ""founder of the PTI"" party.Human rights defenders and journalists' unions have vowed to oppose the law, but with the government holding a majority, its passage is all but assured.Afzal Butt, president of the Federal Union of Journalists, said the law was an attempt to suppress the media, social media and journalists.The government says the law is necessary to limit the spread of disinformation.","Pakistani government proposes sweeping controls on social media.

ISLAMABAD: The first commercial flight landed at Pakistan’s new Gwadar International Airport on Monday following a months-long delay in the opening of the Beijing-funded facility in volatile Balochistan province.The airport’s opening was postponed from Aug 14 to the end of 2024 due to a security review sparked by a series of deadly attacks by separatist militants in Balochistan, in Pakistan’s southwest. Then, on Jan 10, the airport was due to open, but this was again delayed.“The $246-million Chinese-backed project is expected to grow into one of Pakistan’s biggest airports and serve both domestic and international travel,” the Pakistan Aviation Authority (PAA) said in a statement.“Pakistan achieved a landmark moment in its aviation history on Monday as the first commercial flight successfully landed at the new Gwadar International Airport,” the statement read, adding the new airport is poised to play a pivotal role in connecting Pakistan to global markets and facilitating trade, tourism, and economic development.PIA Flight PK-503 departed from Karachi at 9.50 am and touched down at the airport at 11.15 am, carrying 46 passengers. In a video shared by PAA, the PIA flight was seen being greeted by a traditional water salute by water bowsers as it landed.China has pledged more than $65 billion for infrastructure, energy, and other projects in Pakistan under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ). As part of President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Pakistan is also creating a deep-water port near the new Gwadar airport, a joint venture between Pakistan, Oman, and China that is nearing completion. Chinese people and projects have been frequently attacked in the past by separatists who view Beijing as a foreign invader trying to gain control of impoverished but mineral-rich Balochistan, the site of a decades-long insurgency.Recent attacks, including one in Oct 2024 in which two Chinese workers were killed in a suicide bombing in Karachi, have forced Beijing to publicly criticise Pakistan for security lapses. In recent months, the media has widely reported that China wants its own security forces on the ground to protect its nationals and projects, a demand Islamabad has long resisted.","PIA Flight PK-503 departed from Karachi at 9.50 am and touched down at the airport at 11.15 am, carrying 46 passengers.

ISLAMABAD: A pre-Partition place of worship of the minority Ahmadi community was completely demolished by the local administration in Punjab’s Sialkot district, Pakistani media reported on Saturday.The place was built by Chaudhry Zafarullah Khan , Pakistan’s first foreign minister and an Ahmadi by faith, in his native town of Daska, Sialkot. A renowned lawyer in British India, he was a crucial champion for the Ahmadi cause in significant trials.This historical structure was razed on Jan 16, two days after local authorities claimed that an extension of the structure was illegal as it encroached 13 feet onto a public road, a claim rejected by community members.Despite this, Amir Mahmood, spokesperson for the marginalised community, said they had complied with the govt notice and a wall was constructed on the inner side on Jan 15, but the area’s assistant commissioner, accompanied by police, proceeded with the demolition the next day and flattened the entire structure. “It is clear that using the illegal encroachments as an excuse, the administration targeted and demolished the Ahmadi community’s place of worship,” Mahmood said, adding the structure had not been altered or extended since its original construction by Khan’s family before Partition. He blamed the local administration for continuously targeting the community’s properties and ignoring their grievances.The operation lasted from 7pm until 11pm, and electricity to the place of worship and neighbouring areas was also cut off. The action was not strictly administrative as during the entire time, locals said, a number of people had gathered chanting provocative slogans against the persecuted community. This was the latest in a series of actions targeting Ahmadis. According to data, at least 22 of their places of worship were destroyed across Punjab in 2024.","A pre-Partition place of worship of the minority Ahmadi community was completely demolished by the local administration in Punjab.

"Imran, wife sentenced to jail in corruption case",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imran-wife-sentenced-to-jail-in-corruption-case/articleshow/117340821.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Jailed Pakistani former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi , were sentenced to 14-year and seven-year jail terms, respectively, after an accountability court found the couple guilty of corruption by receiving land as a bribe from a Pakistani real-estate czar.The makeshift court operating from Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, where Khan has been incarcerated since Aug 2023, had reserved its verdict three times in the £190-million (about Rs 2,003 crore in Indian currency) Al-Qadir Trust case since Dec last year. Following the ruling, Bushra was arrested from the courtroom.Accountability court judge Nasir Javed Rana also fined Khan Pakistani Rs 1 million ($3,500), while Bibi was fined half that amount.Failure to pay the fines would result in an additional six months in jail for Imran and three months for Bushra, the judge said.According to the verdict, the property of the “sham trust Al-Qadir University Project Trust is hereby forfeited to the federal govt”.“Both convicts are present before the court; they be taken into custody in this case and be handed over to the jail superintendent along with the committal warrant to serve the sentences so awarded,” it added.The couple were indicted in the case on Feb 27, 2024, shortly after the general elections.The case alleges that Khan and his wife had acquired land worth billions of rupees (millions of US dollars) for the Al-Qadir Trust from Malik Riaz Hussain, a prominent property tycoon in Pakistan, to establish a nonprofit educational institute for the poor. In return, Pakistan’s anti-corruption watchdog alleged, Khan’s govt from Aug 2018 to April 2022 had provided legal cover to Riaz’s black money (£130 million), which Britain’s National Crime Agency had recovered and handed over to the Pakistan govt.This has been the fourth major case in which the former cricket star has been convicted. Last year, Khan was convicted in cases related to selling state gifts, leaking state secrets, and unlawful marriage, all of which were later overturned or suspended by the Islamabad high court. Despite this, Khan remains behind bars, with dozens of cases pending against him. He describes the cases as a political witch-hunt.Khan was first arrested in connection with the Al-Qadir Trust case on May 9, 2023, spending just two days in detention. However, the arrest had sparked nationwide protests during which Khan’s supporters had stormed govt buildings and military installations in multiple cities.Speaking to reporters inside the courtroom after his conviction, Imran rejected the notion of striking a deal with anyone to get himself freed from prison. “I will neither make any deal nor seek any relief,” he told reporters, adding that those who stand against dictatorship are punished.His Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI)condemned the conviction as a continuation of “bogus persecution” against Khan and his wife. “While the party awaits the detailed decision, it is important to note that the Al Qadir Trust case against Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi lacks any solid foundation and is bound to collapse,” the PTI said. “All evidence and witness testimonies confirm that there has been no mismanagement or wrongdoing. Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi are merely trustees, with no further involvement in the matter,” it added.","Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to 14-year and seven-year jail terms, respectively.
