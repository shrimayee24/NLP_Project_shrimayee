NEW DELHI: When Manmohan Singh 's daughter Upinder Singh lit the pyre of the former PM , she was following the Sikh tradition of not allowing differentiation on gender lines in who leads rituals linked to cremation. Members of the Sikh community point out that their women have for long carried out rituals on the passing of their parents.The visuals of Upinder Singh performing the rites will still be seen as yet another challenge to well-entrenched patriarchal norms, especially in the north, to exclude women from important religious rituals and encourage a trend which saw former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee being cremated in 2018 by his foster daughter Namita Kaul Bhattacharya.Earlier, in June 2014, former minister from BJP Gopinath Munde was cremated by his daughter Pankaja Munde.Approached for his comment, a Sikh community activist said Upinder Singh's act of leading the rituals only reaffirms the importance of putting the male and female child on the same footing and challenges discriminatory attitudes that stem from patriarchy and not religion. Singh's cremation was carried out in keeping with Sikh traditions amid chanting of hymns. A stoic Upinder Singh was a picture of dignity as she kept her composure while lighting the pyre surrounded by family members including her mother Gursharan Kaur, sisters Daman Singh and Amrit Singh and other family members. Singh's grandchildren too were said to have been present during the rituals.While Upinder Singh is a historian, Singh's second child Daman Singh is a writer known for her book ""Strictly Personal: Manmohan and Gursharan"" that came out in 2014. His third daughter Amrit Singh is a human rights lawyer based in the United States.",Upinder Singh lit the pyre of the former PM Manmohan Singh.

Capital tribute for Manmohan Singh's last journey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/capital-tribute-for-manmohan-singhs-last-journey/articleshow/116751726.cms,"NEW DELHI: Whether it was the Gandhi family , the Congress worker, the man on the street, or the woman in the metro, Delhi stood up in applause and mourning on Saturday to say a final goodbye to Manmohan Singh , the self-effacing former PM who touched as many hearts with his dignity as lives with his economic policies.At the AICC headquarters and along the hearse's route to Nigambodh Ghat , the unusually grey winter morning reflected the solemn mood on the street as thousands gathered to pay respects, the chorus of ""Manmohan Singh amar rahein"" and ""jab tak suraj chand rahega, Manmohan Singh tera naam rahega"" by Congress workers ringing out as a steady beat in a somber procession. The Congress workers also sought Bharat Ratna , India's highest civilian honour, for Singh.If Firaq Gorakhpuri's words - ""ab aksar chup chup se rahe hain, yun hi kab lab khole hain/pehle firaq ko dekha hota ab to bahut kum bolen hain"" - capture the essence of Singh, the stately tribute from the common citizen was a fitting one. Across ages and backgrounds, people from different walks of life and politicians across the spectrum of Right, Left and Centre turned up for Singh's final journey. It was a rare unifying thread in the politically polarised capital of today.The Gandhi family, led by Sonia - who formed a partnership with Singh as UPA chairperson during his two terms as PM from 2004-14 - was the first to offer wreaths at AICC's Akbar Road headquarters, where Singh's remains were brought at 9.12am from his residence on Motilal Nehru Road and laid in state at the main hall, enclosed in a glass casket and draped by the Tricolour.Singh's family - wife Gursharan Kaur and daughters Upinder Singh, Daman Kaur and Amrit Kaur - was there. In a black overcoat, with a black hair band, Sonia was accompanied by son Rahul, who was in his usual half-sleeve white T-shirt and trousers, and daughter Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. The trio had arrived at the AICC headquarters around 8.50am and waited.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and senior members like P Chidambaram, Salman Khurshid, Ashok Gehlot, Pawan Bansal and Ajay Maken were among those who came to pay respects. Senior leadership and functionaries alike, many came with their families as a mark of respect to Singh.Sonia, Rahul, Priyanka and senior Congress functionaries stood like a family beside Gursharan and the daughters throughout the funeral. Rahul sat next to Singh's family members in an Army truck that pulled the cortege from Akbar Road to Nigambodh Ghat, where priests and family members recited hymns from the Gurbani and chants of ""Satnam Waheguru"" filled the air.Singh's last rites were performed with full state honours that were accompanied by a 21-gun salute. The funeral pyre was lit by his eldest daughter Upinder. Singh (92) passed away on the night of Dec 26. Before Singh's remains were consigned to flames, security forces also performed a three-rifle volley and buglers played 'Last Post' as a mark of honour. Personnel from the Army, Navy and Air Force as well as Delhi Police had participated in the procession, marching in formation.""Ghazab ke insaan the. Itni saadgi aur insaniyat politicians mein kum milti hai (He was an exceptional man blessed with simplicity and humanity that one rarely sees in politicians),"" said Subhash, who had come from Anand Parbat at 6.20am to bid farewell to Singh. ""He was a professor, not a politician and he remained one,"" said Aradhana, who had come from south Delhi for the ""leader"" who she had always admired. For many others who waited patiently, outside Singh's house, at the AICC headquarters and near Nigambodh Ghat to catch a final glimpse of him, this was a presence they had to mark, as much for the architect of India's liberalisation as the convergence of traits he personified - intellect, humility and unlimited grace.","Gandhi family led by Sonia was the first to offer wreaths at AICC's Akbar Road headquarters.

Who was Robert Brooks? Handcuffed New York inmate brutally beaten to death by correctional officers; Shocking video of final moments released,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-was-robert-brooks-new-york-inmate-brutally-beaten-to-death-by-guards-shocking-video-of-final-moments-released/articleshow/116729254.cms,"According to James, the body cameras were activated, but the guards did not turn on the audio, leaving the recording eerily soundless during the violent confrontation.

'Haunting moment of Brooks being dragged from the bed'

Governor Hochul's response to the incident

In a release that has sent shockwaves through the public, law enforcement in New York has unveiled devastating body-worn camera footage from the night of December 9, capturing the final moments of 43-year-old Robert Brooks ’ life. Brooks, a Black inmate serving a 12-year sentence for assault at a northern New York prison, was brutally beaten by multiple prison guards.The chilling video showed one of the officers use a shoe to strike Brooks in the stomach, another yanks him up by his neck and drops him back on the table. The officers then remove the man’s shirt and pants as he lies motionless and bloodied on the table.Tragically, Brooks was pronounced dead later that night.Watch the full footage here-The footage, though harrowing, was released by New York Attorney General Letitia James to ensure “transparency and accountability” in the aftermath of Brooks’ death. The video, however, was shockingly silent. According to James, the body cameras were activated, but the guards did not turn on the audio, leaving the recording eerily soundless during the violent confrontation.In the grainy, silent footage, Brooks can be seen lying on a hospital bed, pinned down by several guards. At one point, he is dragged off the bed by his collar, his body limp and bloodied. A preliminary autopsy report confirmed the cause of death as “asphyxia due to compression of the neck,” although full results are still pending.Brooks was serving a 12-year sentence for first-degree assault, according to the Associated Press. He had been transferred to Marcy from the nearby Mohawk Correctional Facility on the same day as the incident.Brooks’ family, understandably shaken, has expressed outrage and sorrow over the release of the footage. In a statement, they called the video ""devastating"" and said watching the ""horrific and violent final moments"" of Robert’s life was a painful experience for them. They vowed to seek justice, saying, “We will not rest until we have secured justice for Robert's memory.”New York Governor Kathy Hochul condemned the incident, declaring in a statement, “We have no tolerance for individuals who cross the line, break the law, and engage in unnecessary violence or targeted abuse.” She emphasized that such actions would not be tolerated in New York.The release of this footage comes as the nation continues to grapple with issues of police and prison brutality, particularly toward Black individuals. The tragic events surrounding George Floyd’s death in 2020 sparked national protests demanding racial justice and accountability, and this latest incident is likely to fuel further calls for change.The video has already become a rallying point for those demanding reforms within the U.S. prison system, and the investigation into Brooks' death is expected to be a focal point for ongoing debates about systemic violence and racial injustice .","Robert Brooks, a Black inmate serving a 12-year sentence for assault, was brutally beaten by multiple prison guards.

Luka Doncic joins Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes as the latest athlete to be targeted by burglars

After NFL superstars Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes , Bucks forward Bobby Portis Jr., Luka Doncic is now the latest athlete to be targeted amid a wave of break-ins. According to a police report filed on Friday, Doncic’s home was broken into while he was away on the Dallas Mavericks ’ road trip. Fortunately, Doncic’s entire family was out of the house when the burglary occurred and is now safe. Luka’s business manager, Beth Seager has confirmed that Doncic has filed a police report and an investigation has now begun.Doncic already has enough to deal with as a calf injury sustained during Christmas Day has sidelined him for at least a month. Now, the added stress of his house being burglarized is surely not healthy. NFL stars Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce were also victims of a burglary back in October. From the NBA, Mike Conley and Bobby Portis’ houses were also broken into during September and November, respectively.The NFL has even addressed the unusual situation and has urged athletes to tighten the security at their houses. The houses of professional athletes all over the country are being targeted by criminals who are reportedly a part of “organized and skilled groups.” Surely, this is a concern for every athlete in the NBA and not just the ones who have already been targeted.The NBA has also revealed that the FBI has connected these burglaries to transnational South American theft groups. Information that is sure to set off alarms in the minds of many athletes across the US. A memo sent out by the NBA shed light on the burglar's intent. They revealed that the thieves are “primarily focused on cash and items that can be resold on the black market, such as jewelry, watches, and luxury bags.”More often than not, athletes are the ones who own the most amount of jewelry, watches, and luxury bags. These are easy to resell which is why the athletes have now become prime targets for certain organized crime rings. The NBA has also asked its athletes to invest in guard services for their homes. They want their stars to protect their properties, especially while they’re away on extended road trips.ALSO READ: Golden State Warriors vs Phoenix Suns (12/28): Starting Five, Injury Report, Start Time, Game Prediction, Betting Tips, How to Watch, and More Similar warnings have also been issued by the NFL, who are trying their best to protect their athletes from becoming the victims of these crimes.

N'DJAMENA: Chad goes to the polls Sunday for legislative, provincial and local elections that are presented by the government as the last stage of a political transition after three years of military rule, but are being boycotted by the opposition.The boycott leaves the field open to candidates aligned with Marshal Mahamat Idriss Itno , who was brought to power by the military in 2021 and then legitimised in a presidential election last May that opposition candidates denounced as fraudulent.""It is better to stay at home,"" said opposition figure Succes Masra in a long Facebook live on Saturday, denouncing a ""system built on lies and electoral theft.""""The fabricated results are already in the computers,"" he said.On Saturday evening, the opposition Democratic Party of the Chadian People (PDPT) claimed that more than a thousand ballots intended for the sub-prefecture of Bongor had disappeared, and called for ""vigilance"" to ""thwart the fraud networks"" set up by the ruling MPS party.Polling stations will be open from 6 am to 6 pm (0500 to 1700 GMT) to welcome the approximately eight million registered voters, watched by a hundred foreign observers and representatives of different political parties.As in previous elections, soldiers, members of the police forces and nomadic people began voting Saturday.- 'Bloodbath' -Voting is taking place against a backdrop of recurring attacks by jihadist group Boko Haram in the Lake Chad region, the ending of a military accord with former colonial master France and accusations that Chad is interfering in the conflict ravaging neighbouring Sudan.Itno's government has presented the weekend elections as a key stage in the transition to democratic rule.The 40-year-old took power in 2021 after the death of his father, Idriss Deby Itno, who had ruled the poor Sahel country with an iron fist for three decades.The younger Itno then won a five-year term in the disputed May election.Chad's last legislative elections date back to 2011, but several subsequent votes were postponed due to jihadist threats, financial difficulties, and the coronavirus epidemic.A 93-member transition parliament was chosen and installed by a presidential decree in 2021.The opposition says the regime has become increasingly autocratic and repressive. In his speech on Saturday, Succes Masra recalled the ""bloodbath"" that greeted opposition demonstrations in October 2022.Despite attempts by the ruling party to drum up enthusiasm, the ballots are being handed out amid a near news blackout because of an ongoing strike by online journalists protesting restrictions placed on them.The country's private press will not cover election day because the government refused to provide the subsidies that are normally paid for this sort of event.","Chad goes to the polls Sunday for legislative, provincial and local elections.

The Coast Guard used infrared technology to search from the air.Authorities used camera recordings to locate the vehicle used by the pair off Oklahoma Road near Willard, which is on the southern border of the national forest.","Two Oregon men were found dead in a Washington state forest after they failed to return from a trip to look for Sasquatch.

A Colorado man was recently arrested for allegedly assaulting a television news reporter after questioning his US citizenship and saying, “This is Trump’s America now.”On December 18, Patrick Thomas Egan , 39, allegedly followed KKCO/KJCT reporter Ja’Ronn Alex for approximately 40 miles from Delta to Grand Junction in Colorado. Egan, driving a taxi, confronted Alex at a stoplight. According to the arrest affidavit, Egan said something like: “Are you even a US citizen? This is Trump’s America now! I’m a Marine and I took an oath to protect this country from people like you!” according to a CNN report.The reporter, a Detroit native, told the police that he believed he was followed and attacked because he is Pacific Islander.Alex was driving a news vehicle at the time of the incident. He drove back to his news station after the incident. When he got out of his vehicle, Egan allegedly chased him as he ran toward the station’s door, demanding identification. The affidavit states Egan tackled Alex, put him in a headlock, and “began to strangle him.” Coworkers and witnesses intervened, reporting that Alex appeared to be struggling to breathe. The incident was partially recorded on surveillance video.Police arrested Egan in Grand Junction on suspicion of bias-motivated crimes, second-degree assault, and harassment. He is scheduled for a court appearance on Thursday to determine formal charges.","Patrick Thomas Egan, 39, allegedly followed KKCO/KJCT reporter Ja’Ronn Alex for approximately 40 miles from Delta to Grand Junction in Colorado.

The incident claimed the lives of at least 85 people, according to Yonhap news agency.In the footage documenting the crash, the plane is seen skidding uncontrollably along the runway before erupting into a massive fireball. Thick black smoke emerged from the engines during its attempted landing, only for the aircraft to be engulfed in flames moments later.The aircraft’s attempted ‘belly landing’—a last resort maneuver used when landing gear fails—is believed to have contributed to the crash. Initial reports suggest that the landing gear malfunctioned following suspected contact with birds.The incident occurred at 9:07 am local time, when the flight from Bangkok to Muan veered off the runway and collided with a fence at the airport, located approximately 288 kilometers southwest of Seoul. Onboard were 175 passengers and six crew members, most of them South Korean nationals, along with two Thai citizens.Jeju Air, founded in 2005, is one of South Korea’s leading low-cost carriers with a spotless safety track record. Its only other notable accident occurred in 2007 when a Bombardier Q400 veered off the runway due to strong winds at Busan-Gimhae Airport, resulting in a dozen injuries but no fatalities.The tragedy comes days after another aviation disaster in Kazakhstan, where an Azerbaijan Airlines flight burst into flames, claiming 38 lives.

TBILISI: Georgia is set to inaugurate on Sunday a ruling party loyalist as president after his election was declared ""illegitimate"" by the outgoing leader and the pro-Western opposition .Former footballer Mikheil Kavelashvili's inauguration is expected to further escalate the political crisis which has seen mass pro-EU demonstrations.The Black Sea nation has been in turmoil since October's disputed parliamentary elections and the government's decision to shelve European Union accession talks.Thousands have taken to the streets daily for a month, accusing the increasingly repressive government of derailing Tbilisi's European Union bid, with a fresh rally planned outside parliament during Kavelashvili's inauguration.For the first time in Georgia's history, the swearing-in ceremony will be held behind closed doors in the parliamentary chamber.On December 14, an electoral college controlled by the ruling Georgian Dream party installed the far-right ex-Manchester City striker as the country's next figurehead leader.But outgoing President Salome Zurabishvili , whose mandate ends with the new leader's inauguration, has vowed to not step down until the government announces fresh parliamentary elections.Opposition parties have refused to enter the newly elected parliament, while Zurabishvili has declared the legislature, the government and president-elect ""illegitimate"".Addressing tens of thousands of protesters last Sunday, she said that a re-run of the ""illegitimate"" election would be the ""formula to resolve such a crisis"".Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze's announcement on November 28 that Tbilisi would not seek the opening of EU accession talks until 2028 triggered a month of daily mass protests which are still ongoing.It remains unclear how Georgian Dream would react if Zurabishvili refused to leave the presidential palace.She is hugely popular among protesters who see her as a beacon of Georgia's European aspirations.Many have vowed to defend her against any attempted eviction from office.Kobakhidze said Zurabishvili's failure to vacate the Orbeliani Palace ""would constitute a criminal offence punishable by many years of imprisonment"".Mirroring language reminiscent of that used by the Kremlin about its political opponents, Kobakhidze has described protesters as ""violent groups"" controlled by a ""liberal fascist"" opposition and ruled out calling fresh elections.In the first 10 days of protests, riot police used tear gas and water cannons to disperse demonstrators -- some of whom threw fireworks and stones.The interior ministry reported more than 400 arrests, while the country's top human rights official, ombudsman Levan Ioseliani and Amnesty International have accused security forces of ""torturing"" those detained.The reported police brutality has drawn growing international condemnation, with Washington and several European countries imposing visa bans on Georgian Dream officials.On Friday, the United States imposed sanctions on Georgia's former prime minister and the honorary chairman of Georgian Dream, Bidzina Ivanishvili, saying he undermined the country's democratic future for Russia's benefit.Oligarch Ivanishvili, Georgia's richest man, is widely regarded as the de facto leader of Georgia, despite holding no official position.Last week, the United States and Britain slapped sanctions on Georgia's interior minister and other senior officials over a clampdown on pro-Western demonstrators.Constitutional law experts -- including one author of Georgia's constitution, Vakhtang Khmaladze -- have also said the new parliament, government and president-elect are ""illegitimate"".That is because a court ruling on Zurabishvili's bid to get parliamentary poll results annulled was still pending at the time the chamber convened. The court eventually ruled the case inadmissible.Tensions have ratcheted higher in Georgia since 2022, driven by the ruling party's shift from its initially liberal, pro-Western agenda to what critics have denounced as an ultra-conservative pro-Russian tilt.That has led Brussels to freeze Georgia's EU accession process.","Mikheil Kavelashvili set to be inaugurated as president of Georgia on Sunday.

In a fiery exchange on X (formerly Twitter), Elon Musk and Steven Mackey , apparently a Trump supporter, found themselves at odds over the ongoing debate surrounding H-1B visas and immigration reform . The controversy ignited when Mackey shared a video clip of Musk discussing the limits of traditional education and critical thinking, which Musk framed as a “mental straight jacket” that limits creativity.Mackey, in the context of the heated H-1B visa debate, shared Musk’s comments with the caption, “Stop trying to optimize something that shouldn’t exist. Let’s optimize H1-B.”” He used Musk’s words to make a point about the need for reforms to the H-1B visa program, which has come under scrutiny for its handling of skilled worker immigration in the US.Mackey’s tweet quickly went viral, drawing both support and backlash. In response, Musk, known for his strong opinions, fired back with a blunt and defiant reply, which many perceived as an aggressive defense of the H-1B program.“The reason I’m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX , Tesla , and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B,” Musk wrote. He then added, “Take a big step back and F*** YOURSELF in the face. I will go to war on this issue the likes of which you cannot possibly comprehend.”The heated exchange didn’t end there. Mackey, attempting to clarify the situation, posted a follow-up message. “There seems to be a lot of confusion about this interaction,” he said. “I personally am the biggest fan of Elon on the planet and I always will be. I’m also capable of disagreeing with people I deeply respect and admire.”Mackey further elaborated that while he was agnostic about the future of the H-1B visa program, he acknowledged the existence of “extreme abuse” within the system that needed to be addressed. He called for a fair and balanced resolution to the issue, expressing hope that Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy , and the Dogecoin community could contribute to the reform debate in a meaningful way.This clash highlights the ongoing tension surrounding immigration policies, particularly in the tech sector, where the H-1B visa program has been a focal point. While Musk’s stance seems to champion the importance of skilled foreign workers , his exchange with Mackey has raised questions about the future direction of U.S. immigration reform.","Elon Musk and Steven Mackey found themselves at odds over the ongoing debate surrounding H-1B visas and immigration reform.

Biden reportedly regrets dropping out of US presidential race.

No blame on Kamala

Pressure to withdraw

Breaking 'transitional president' promise

Acknowledging mistakes

Dissatisfaction with the attorney general

US President Joe Biden regrets leaving the presidential race and believes he could have defeated President-elect Donald Trump in the 2024 election, according to sources who spoke with The Washington Post. Biden reportedly expressed these regrets to confidantes recently, claiming he was pressured by the Democratic Party to withdraw from the race in July.Biden and some of his aides have recently told confidantes that the president should have remained in the race and could have secured a second term, The Washington Post reported on Saturday, citing multiple anonymous sources familiar with the discussions.Biden's withdrawal followed low poll numbers and a poorly received debate performance on June 27, 2024, in which he provided unclear responses and appeared to struggle with his words. Vice president Kamala Harris , who ran as the Democratic presidential nominee, subsequently lost to Trump in the general election. Sources say Biden has not blamed Harris or her campaign.“Aides say the president has been careful not to place blame on Harris or her campaign,” the Washington Post report said.The president previously hinted at party pressure in an August interview with CBS News Sunday Morning, suggesting concerns from House and Senate Democrats about their own reelection chances. He also expressed confidence in a potential victory against Trump during a September appearance on The View.Many Democrats attribute Harris’s loss to Biden’s reluctance to exit the race earlier.“Biden ran on the promise that he was going to be a transitional president, and in effect, have one term before handing it off to another generation,” Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Connecticut) told The Washington Post. “I think his running again broke that concept — the conceptual underpinning of the theory that he would end the Trump appeal; he would defeat Trumpism and enable a new era.”Some advisors acknowledge a disconnect between Biden's governing style and current political dynamics. “The president has been operating on a time horizon measured in decades, while the political cycle is measured in four years,” Jake Sullivan, Biden’s national security adviser, told the outlet.Biden has recently acknowledged mistakes, including his debate performance and the handling of pandemic relief checks. He and his aides also reportedly believe they could have improved public morale during the pandemic.The Washington Post also reports Biden has expressed dissatisfaction with Attorney General Merrick Garland, claiming he was both too aggressive in prosecuting his son, Hunter, and too slow in pursuing charges against Trump related to the January 6th riots, charges that were later dismissed.","Biden and some of his aides have recently told confidantes that the president should have remained in the race and could have secured a second term.

President-elect Donald Trump took to Truth Social, alleging that the Democrats had paid celebrities to lend their public support to Vice President Kamala Harris.In a post on Saturday, Trump claimed the Democrats had spent millions to secure endorsements from high-profile figures such as Beyoncé, Oprah Winfrey, and MSNBC host Al Sharpton.“Are the Democrats allowed to pay $11,000,000, $2,000,000, and $500,000 to get the ENDORSEMENT of Beyoncé, Oprah, and Reverend Al? I don’t think so,” the former president wrote.He went on to criticise the involvement of these figures, stating, “Beyoncé didn’t sing, Oprah didn’t do much of anything (she called it ‘expenses’), and Al is just a third rate Con Man.”Beyoncé and Oprah had both appeared alongside Harris during the campaign trail, with Oprah recently insisting that she “was not paid a dime” for her involvement in a live-streamed event, though the campaign did cover production fees, The Hill reported.Sharpton, the prominent civil rights activist and MSNBC host, interviewed Harris in October. He is also the founder of the National Action Network, a non-profit organisation that received a $500,000 donation from Harris’ campaign shortly before the interview. Sharpton subsequently organised a get-out-the-vote rally for Harris, just three days after the segment aired.An MSNBC spokesperson told the Washington Free Beacon that the network was unaware of the donations to the National Action Network. The network has declined to comment further on the matter, citing its policy of not discussing ""personnel matters.""Trump, in his Saturday post, questioned the legality of the donation, suggesting that it might be in violation of campaign laws.""So what is going on here??? Totally against the law, and I have heard there are many others!!!"" he wrote, continuing his criticism of Harris' campaign spending.Throughout the 2024 election cycle, Trump has frequently taken issue with Harris’ media appearances, including a CBS News interview in which he claimed the network altered her responses before airing.","Donald Trump took to Truth Social to criticise Vice President-elect Kamala Harris' campaign spending.

The process of recreating the face is one of the few options available for investigators, who have been trying to use DNA analysis in the five days since the horrifying murder.Almost a week after the horrific incident in which Guatemalan illegal migrant Sebastian Zapeta Calil set a sleeping woman on fire in an NYC subway car, the identity of the woman has not been established. NYPD found a walker from the site indicating that the victim had mobility issues for which she could not immediately respond to the fire and could only get up when she was completely burnt.Social media users wrongly identified the woman as one Amelia Carter and an AI-generated image went viral while in reality the investigators are trying out all options available to identify the woman. No relatives or friends came forward claiming to have known the victim -- indicating that she was probably a homeless person.“Facial recognition or approximation comes in when you’re really trying to shake the trees, because you’ve kind of hit a dead end, nothing’s showing up database, days and weeks have gone by and you want to call in the public to say, ‘Does anybody know who this person is?'” said Nathan Lents, a professor of Biology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.“Getting DNA from a badly burned body can be challenging, but a lot of times ‘badly burned’ just means badly on the outside and beyond visual recognition,” said Lents.“There may be plenty of bones and internal soft tissue that is accessible for DNA extraction, unless the body has been completely incinerated, as in a cremation.”Authorities announced Friday they were making strides with the DNA extraction, but not enough to identify the victim.“As many of you know, the criminal court complaint and the indictment at this time indicates the death of a Jane Doe. The police and the medical examiner’s office and many investigators are working to identify her,” Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said at a press conference. “The body was badly burned, and so advanced fingerprinting efforts are being made, as well as advanced DNA evidence to identify her. We have made some progress in that area, but I’m not at liberty to get into specifics now,” he said.","The identity of the woman who was set on fire in the NYC subway is not yet known. The police are now considering using anthropological facial reconstruction to solve the case. The process of recreating the face is one of the few options available for investigators, who have been trying to use DNA analysis.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116748316,imgsize-1169157,width-400,resizemode-4/116748316.jpg"

The boy, identified as Balach, son of Sabrullah, is from the Panjgur district, and his family members claimed that he was forcibly taken from his home ten days ago during a raid by Pakistani forces.According to The Balochistan Post, Balach was reportedly subjected to physical abuse before being taken away while still injured. Authorities have yet to comment on the incident, which has sparked concern among local and international human rights organisations.The Pakistani military's repeated targeting of the family has been documented, with previous incidents including a raid on their residence where property was damaged and two hand grenades were thrown outside, though no injuries were reported.According to local sources, the forces have conducted regular raids on the house, subjecting the family to continuous intimidation, as per the report.In another incident, Pakistani forces detained a man identified as Fazal Bashir in the coastal city of Gwadar. Fazal, a resident of Hirabad area in Kech district, was detained on December 23, and his location remains unidentified, according to The Balochistan Post.His family has sought assistance from human rights organisations to determine his whereabouts, worried about his safety. The persistent issue of enforced disappearances in Balochistan continues to draw attention, with local activists and human rights organisations demanding accountability and the release of missing persons.Despite continuous calls for justice, these incidents highlight the ongoing accusations against Pakistani security forces in the region.The families of Balach and Fazal have requested authorities to investigate their cases and provide information about their missing relatives.Balochistan continues to witness systematic abductions and killings, affecting various segments of society including activists, politicians, journalists and civilians, who are reportedly taken by security forces, according to news agency ANI.The Pakistani military faces frequent accusations of using enforced disappearances as a tactic against insurgents and separatist groups. Human rights organisations and Baloch nationalist groups argue that these abductions aim to suppress opposition.These disappearances often lead to torture and extrajudicial killings, intensifying the human rights situation in the region, the report added.","A 13-year-old boy and a man have gone missing in Balochistan.

At least 10 people were killed and hundreds injured during the May 9 riots, while approximately 40 public buildings and military installations were damaged, including the Lahore corps commander’s House (Jinnah House) and Askari Tower in Lahore, the army’s general headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) office in Faisalabad, the Radio Pakistan building in Peshawar, a toll plaza on the Swat motorway, and a PAF base in Imran’s hometown of Mianwali.Imran and his party have called for a judicial probe into last year’s events, claiming that violence on May 9 was a “false flag” operation aimed at crushing PTI.

May 9 Riots and aftermath

International outcry

Pakistan's response

Pakistan's military courts have sentenced 60 more civilians to prison for their alleged involvement in the violent May 9, 2023, riots that targeted military sites and other facilities following the arrest of former Prime Minister Imran Khan This brings the total number of convictions related to the unrest to 85, according to announcements from the military’s Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).Among those sentenced is Hassan Niazi , Khan’s nephew, who received a 10-year prison term for his alleged role in the attack on the Lahore Corps Commander’s residence, also known as Jinnah House.The ISPR stated that the Field General Court Martial handed down the sentences after reviewing evidence and ensuring due process. “Sequel to the announcement of the May 9 punishments... the Field General Court Martial has promulgated the punishments to the following remaining 60 culprits after examining all evidence, ensuring the provision of all legal rights to the convicts, completion of due process, and the appropriate legal proceedings,” the ISPR announced.The convicted individuals face sentences ranging from two to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment. They have the right to appeal the decisions under Pakistan's Constitution.The unrest on May 9 erupted after Imran Khan’s arrest in a corruption case. Supporters of Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party allegedly attacked key military installations, including the Army General Headquarters in Rawalpindi, the Corps Commander’s House in Lahore, and an ISI office in Faisalabad.In response, authorities detained hundreds of individuals, and 103 were handed over to military courts for trial, sparking widespread criticism of the opaque judicial process.The convictions have drawn sharp rebukes from international entities, including the United States, United Kingdom, and the European Union. Critics argue that the use of military courts to try civilians undermines judicial independence and transparency.“These military courts lack judicial independence, transparency, and due process guarantees,” the US State Department said. Similarly, the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office (FCO) criticized the lack of transparency and independent oversight in the trials, emphasizing the importance of adhering to fair trial standards under international law.The European Union also expressed concern, highlighting that Pakistan’s actions contradict its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and commitments tied to the GSP+ trade program.The Pakistani government has defended the use of military courts, citing the Supreme Court’s decision that allowed the military to proceed with trials of civilians involved in the riots. The Foreign Office reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to international human rights obligations, asserting that the trials were conducted in accordance with national laws.The ISPR emphasized that the convictions reflect the military’s resolve to uphold justice and maintain the authority of the state, stating, “The Nation, Government, and Armed Forces remain steadfast in their commitment to upholding justice and ensuring that the inviolable writ of the state is maintained.”","Pakistan's military courts have sentenced 60 more civilians to prison for their alleged involvement in the violent May 9, 2023, riots.

This has been the fourth time in the past few years that Pakistan has conducted airstrikes inside Afghanistan, and the second time since March 2024.“Last night (Tuesday), Pakistan bombarded four points in Barmal district of Paktika province. The total number of dead is 46, most of whom were children and women,” said Zabihullah Mujahid, spokesperson for the Afghan Taliban govt. He added that six others, mostly children, were wounded.Condemning the airstrikes, the Afghan defence ministry called them “barbaric” and a clear “aggression”. It stated that several refugees, including women and children, were killed and injured. “The Pakistani side should understand that such arbitrary measures are not a solution to any problem,” Enayatullah Khowarazami, spokesperson for Afghanistan’s defence ministry, wrote on social media platform ‘X’. “The Islamic Emirate (Afghan Taliban regime) will not leave this cowardly act unanswered, but rather considers the defence of its territory and sovereignty to be its inalienable right,” he added.The strikes took place hours after Pakistan special representative for Afghanistan Mohammad Sadiq met interim Afghan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi and interior minister Sirajuddin Haqqani in Kabul, intending to resume diplomatic dialogue after a year-long gap. The deteriorating ties, however, are likely to worsen following Tuesday night’s airstrikes, analysts said.Pakistan alleges the Afghan government harbours armed groups, particularly the TTP, which conducts cross-border assaults against Pakistani security forces. In one of the worst recent assaults on security forces, the TTP had claimed responsibility for the killing of at least 16 Pakistani soldiers in South Waziristan last week.Kabul, however, denies providing shelter to armed groups or allowing their territory to be used for cross-border attacks.Border tensions between the two countries have surged since the Taliban regime took control in 2021, with Pakistan experiencing a revival of militant activity along its western border. Deadly air attacks by Pakistan’s military in Afghan border regions in March, which the Taliban claimed killed eight civilians, had sparked confrontations along the the disputed border between the two countries.","Pakistani security officials said the airstrikes took place in Murgha and Laman areas of Barmal district, in Afghanistan’s eastern Paktika province.

So, when attacks on military assets occur, the Military Act is enforced,"" he said while addressing a press conference.Tarar criticised Khan's party for using military courts as a political tool, aiming to create controversy around them. He clarified that military courts only handle cases involving attacks on defence establishments, citing incidents such as the attack on the Corps Commander's House in Lahore.The minister also criticised the PTI for changing its stance regarding trials of civilians in the military courts, recalling that during Khan's tenure, military court trials were praised.""The statements praising the military courts from PTI's leadership are still available on social media. Yet now, the same individuals are lobbying internationally against these courts,"" Tarar said.He assured that military trials adhere to fair trial principles and dismissed claims of injustice in military trials.The military courts tasked to hear cases of suspects involved in the attacks on military facilities on the May 9, 2023 protest last week sentenced 25 civilians to prison terms ranging from 2-10 years.Khan's party criticized the verdicts, arguing that military courts have no jurisdiction over civilians.",Information minister Attaullah Tarar says military courts are competent to deal with cases related to attacks on army facilities.

Pakistan has repeatedly accused the Afghan Taliban of providing shelter to TTP fighters, who have increased attacks on Pakistani forces in recent months. In response, the Afghan Taliban denies these allegations, asserting that civilians, not militants, were targeted in the latest strikes.“The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan considers this a brutal act against all international principles and blatant aggression and strongly condemns it,” said the Afghan ministry of defence. “The Islamic Emirate will not leave this cowardly act unanswered but rather considers the defense of its territory to be its inalienable right.”Islamabad contends that many TTP leaders and fighters have fled to Afghanistan, finding refuge in border provinces under Taliban protection. Afghan officials, however, have refuted these claims, stating that the victims of the bombings were primarily displaced civilians.The strikes came just after Mohammad Sadiq, Pakistan’s special representative for Afghanistan, visited Kabul for discussions on trade and bilateral relations.

The sanctions had frozen any US property owned by the targeted entities and barred US nationals from doing business with them.“Pakistan does not harbour any intention in which its nuclear system is aggressive, it is 100% in Pakistan’s defence. It is just intended for deterrence purposes and nothing else,” Sharif told cabinet members during a meeting.Noting that his foreign affairs ministry had given a “comprehensive response” to Washington on the matter, Sharif said, “This programme is not mine, nor any political party’s; it belongs to the 240 million people of this country, and it is dear to them. There will be no compromise on this programme, and the entire nation is united on this issue.”According to a US state department factsheet, the Islamabad-based NDC had sought to obtain components for Pakistan’s long-range ballistic-missile programme and missile-testing equipment. It stated the NDC “is responsible for the development of Pakistan’s ballistic missiles,” including the Shaheen family of missiles.The US sanctions were preceded by high-level military engagements between China and Pakistan.

Youxia, who is vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), the overall command of the Chinese military headed by President Xi Jinping, had held one-on-one talks with Pakistan army chief Gen Asim Munir during his visit.

However, during their indictment, they pleaded guilty and requested to record their confessional statements. Judge Tanveer Ahmad Sheikh ensured the accused understood the implications of their confessions, allowing them 30 minutes to reconsider before recording their statements.Nazia Naheed, a former stewardess from Karachi, admitted to using a fake BA degree to gain a promotion.

Copying Cirus

MUMBAI: A little-known incident in the history of Pakistan’s nuclear weapons programme is a purported attempt made by the country in the early ’70s to copy the design of India’s Cirus reactor — a 40 MW thermal neutron research facility, which first achieved criticality at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in Trombay, near Mumbai, on July 10, 1960. An acronym for Canada India Reactor Utility Services, Cirus was constructed with Canadian assistance at a shared cost of $14.14 million, according to news reports.Pakistan’s attempt to copy the design of the reactor was revealed by none other than Feroz H. Khan , a man who played a role in the neighbouring country’s nuclear weapons programme. In his book “Eating Grass: The Making Of The Pakistani Bomb”, published in 2012 by the Stanford University Press, Feroz wrote, “Munir Ahmed Khan, later chairman of the PAEC [Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission], recalled that in October 1965 he had met Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto [the then Pakistan foreign minister] in Vienna. Munir explained to him that he had been to India’s Cirus facility at Trombay in 1964 and saw for himself that India was well on its way to making the [nuclear] bomb. Bhutto asked Munir to meet Ayub Khan in December during Ayub’s upcoming visits to the United Kingdom and the United States and try to convince the president of the urgency of a weapons programme.” The country eventually carried out its first nuclear weapons tests on May 28 and 30, 1998.Feroz’s disclosure, though now 12 years old, assumes immediate significance in the context of the US last week announcing fresh sanctions on Pakistan’smissile development programme. For the first time, the measures target Pakistan’s state-run National Development Complex, for its role in the country’s mission development programme. US deputy NSA Jon Finer has said, “Pakistan has developed increasingly sophisticated missile technology… If these trends continue, Pakistan will have the capability to strike targets well beyond South Asia, including in the United States.”Feroz’s writing about the Cirus reactor is important because the plutonium for India’s Smiling Buddha project — the country’s first nuclear weapons test at Pokhran on May 18, 1974 — was from this reactor.According to Feroz, “Pakistani leadership wanted the rights to copy technological designs for its indigenous programme without incurring penalties and while remaining on the ‘good side’ of the international system.” He recalled: “While work to commission KANUPP [Karachi Nuclear Power Complex] went on, Munir Ahmed Khan said that there would be a secret team headed by a nuclear official, Sardar Ali Khan, to work on replicating India’s Cirus reactor.The author quotes Pervez Butt, who was purportedly part of the secret “copying’’ team and was chairman of PAEC between 2001 and 2005, as telling him, “Our team worked tirelessly, I did the mechanical part. When we merged our work and presented, Munir Khan could not believe it.”Feroz, however, has questioned Pakistan’s decision to copy the design of the Cirus reactor because there were some fundamental differences between Cirus and Kanupp.The team had modified the basic Cirus design.","Pakistan's attempt to copy the design of the reactor was revealed by none other than Feroz H. Khan. Cirus was constructed with Canadian assistance at a shared cost of $14.14 million.

Pakistan government forms committee to negotiate with jailed former premier Imran Khan's party,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-government-forms-committee-to-negotiate-with-jailed-former-premier-imran-khans-party/articleshow/116570205.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The Shehbaz Sharif-led Pakistan government on Sunday formed a negotiation committee to start formal talks with jailed former prime minister Imran Khan 's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party after it threatened to give a call for civil disobedience.According to a government statement, the committee includes deputy Prime Minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, the prime minister's political aide Rana Sanaullah, education minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, minister for privatisation Aleem Khan, minister for religious affairs Chaudhry Salik Hussain and Senator Irfan Siddiqui among others.The PTI welcomed the formation of the government committee for negotiations, calling it a ""positive step"".""We consider the committee's formation a constructive step. Meaningful dialogue based on positive intentions should be held,"" PTI chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said.He stressed that the potential talks should have a defined timeframe, adding that the dialogue must progress positively considering the sensitivity of the situation.National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq had taken the lead by offering on Wednesday that he was ready to host the two sides and facilitate their parleys.He welcomed the newly constituted committee and invited the government and opposition for talks, saying ""the speaker's office is always open for members"", according to a statement issued by the NA Secretariat.The speaker called on members of both committees to meet on Monday morning, adding that he would meet them at his chambers in Parliament House.PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqas Akram said his party accepted the speaker's invitation to meet. He said their committee will attend the meeting on Monday.Akram said the PTI founder will be informed about the progress of the meeting and he will decide whether to cancel the civil disobedience movement .The talks are being held after the PTI had threatened to give a call for civil disobedience.The party posted on X from the account of the jailed former prime minister regarding the call for civil disobedience movement, which was initially shared on December 19, stating that the campaign will be launched if the government doesn't make progress on the party's demands by Sunday.""I had presented two demands to the government, the release of under-trial political prisoners and the establishment of a judicial commission for a transparent investigation into the events of May 9, 2023 and November 26, 2024,"" the post quoted PTI founder Khan. It further stated that both of these demands ""are legitimate"".""If the government fails to take any action on them by Sunday, the first phase of the civil disobedience movement - 'remittance boycott' - will be launched,"" it said.PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqas Akram also reiterated that the civil disobedience drive would be launched tomorrow (Monday) if the party's demands go unmet.However, the issue of civil disobedience has been apparently put on hold for some time while allowing the two sides to address the differences through political means.Khan, 72, on December 5 had warned of a civil disobedience movement from December 14 if his demands about the release of political prisoners facing trial and the formation of a judicial commission to probe the events of May 9, 2023, and November 26 this year were unmet.Meanwhile, Pakistan's military courts sentenced 25 civilians to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years for attacking military installations during riots which erupted following the arrest of Khan in May last year, the Army announced on Saturday.On May 9, 2023, Khan's PTI supporters allegedly attacked several military installations, including the army headquarters in Rawalpindi and the ISI building in Faisalabad, to vent their anger against the arrest of their party founder in a corruption case.Hundreds of suspects were arrested in the countrywide swoop and at least 103 were handed over to the military authorities for trial due to their involvement in attacks on military installations.Khan's party has launched multiple protests through 2023 and 2024 demanding the release of their supreme leader, the latest being in November 2024.The former prime minister, currently lodged at the Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail, was arrested in August last year and faces multiple cases since his government was toppled in April 2022.","The committee includes deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, the prime minister's political aide Rana Sanaullah, education minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, minister for privatisation Aleem Khan. National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq had taken the lead by offering on Wednesday that he was ready to host the two sides.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116570246,imgsize-1097818,width-400,resizemode-4/116570246.jpg"
