"HC CJ retired, escaped probe for NCLAT 'interference': CJI Gavai",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-cj-retired-escaped-probe-for-nclat-interference-cji-gavai/articleshow/125527251.cms,"Outgoing CJI Gavai



Ex-HC CJ not in ambit of detailed in-house proceedings

The CJI said he had sought a report from NCLAT judicial member Justice Sharad Kumar Sharma who had startled everyone by disclosing in open court on Aug 13 that ""one of the most revered members of the higher judiciary of this country"" had approached him to secure a favourable order and recused himself from hearing the case.The CJI said by the time Justice Sharma sent a detailed report, the HC chief justice in question had retired; thus, a formal in-house inquiry could not be ordered against the errant member of the judiciary.The CJI said that shortly after he initiated deliberations among his colleagues over the process or procedure to be adopted to weed out such attempts in future, the President appointed Justice Surya Kant as his successor to the post of CJI. ""That is why I thought it better to leave it to the new CJI to take appropriate action on the issue,"" he said.The retired HC CJ is out of the ambit of detailed in-house proceedings, an adverse finding in which could persuade the CJI to recommend govt to initiate a motion in Parliament for the judge's removal. However, he may not be completely out of the arc of accountability as the new CJI, Justice Surya Kant, could still recommend registration of FIR under Prevention of Corruption Act.On November 14, addressing the matter, a bench of CJI-designate Justice Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi had told advocate Prashant Bhushan, who was appearing for a petitioner, that ""action will have to be initiated at the highest level (of the judiciary, that is the CJI) against the one who attempted to interfere with the administration of justice. If Supreme Court takes up this issue on the judicial side, then it would run counter to the power vested in the highest authority. The highest authority cannot be guided by judicial orders to take a decision.""Noting the seriousness of the matter, the bench had said that under the existing legal framework for fixing accountability on constitutional court judges, the issue raised by the petitioner should be dealt with on the administrative side.","Ex-HC CJ not in ambit of detailed in-house proceedings.

NEW DELHI: Amid the political row kicked up by the proposed constitutional amendment to bring Chandigarh under the ambit of Article 240, home ministry Sunday clarified that the proposal neither ""seeks to alter Chandigarh's governance or administrative structure"" nor ""change the traditional arrangements between Chandigarh and the states of Punjab and Haryana"".In a post on X, the home ministry held out the reassurance that the central govt has no intention of introducing any Bill on the issue in the upcoming winter session of Parliament.The statement followed protests from political parties in Punjab which claimed that the proposed amendment to put the administration of Chandigarh under a lieutenant governor, in line with other Union territories which don't have assemblies, was an attempt to weaken Punjab's control over the UT.The parties were reacting to a Lok Sabha bulletin listing the bills the govt could consider moving in the Winter session. Chandigarh is currently governed by an administrator, a position vested in the Punjab governor.The home ministry's post said the intention behind the proposal was to only simplify the central govt's law-making process for the Union territory of Chandigarh.

NEW DELHI: Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind (JUH) president Maulana Arshad Madani's remarks alleging discrimination against Muslims while citing the example of Al-Falah University, which is under the scanner in the Delhi blast probe, have triggered a storm. Accusing the govt of working relentlessly to ensure that Muslims don't progress, Madani claimed that while Zohran Mamdani and Sadiq Khan could become the mayors of New York and London, respectively, Muslims in India cannot even become vice chancellors of universities.""And even if someone does, they will be sent to jail, like Azam Khan.

Besides the current probe, it is alleged that Siddiqui was held in Delhi in an earlier case following a complaint of cheating and spent over two years in Tihar jail. He came out on bail in Feb 2004 and was later acquitted in the case by court the next year, after he and his brother agreed to make repayments.Madani said, ""The govt, since the time India got freedom, has been working on preventing Muslims from raising their heads.It is the result of this that today you hear people saying that there is a lack of leadership among Muslims."" Citing a Hindi idiom, he said the govt wants the Muslims ""to feel the ground slipping under their feet"", and ""it is happening...""BJP netas hit back on Sunday over Madani's remarks.

'Objective Is To Destroy The Enemy': Op Sindoor Echoes As Indian Army Vows Stronger Response to Pak

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DLEHI: The French Navy on Sunday criticised Pakistani media for publishing what it described as “misinformation and disinformation” about India’s Operation Sindoor , after one outlet claimed a French officer had confirmed Pakistani air superiority and the shooting down of Indian Rafale jets during a border confrontation earlier this year in May.In a statement issued on its official X handle, the ‘Marine Nationale’ said the article had fabricated comments and even misidentified the officer involved.“FAKENEWS: These statements were attributed to Captain Launay who never gave his consent for any form of publication. The article contains extensive misinformation and disinformation,” the post said. Pakistan based broadcaster Geo TV’s November 21 report had quoted a “Jacques Launay” as allegedly praising the Pakistan air force during a supposed May 6–7 aerial engagement involving over 140 fighters, and claiming Indian Rafales were downed with Chinese support. The French Navy said the officer’s real name is Captain Yvan Launay - and none of the comments attributed to him were genuine.Clarifying his actual role, the Navy said: “First name is Yvan, not Jacquis. Contrary to what has been established in the article, his responsibilities are limited to commanding the organic naval air station where the French Rafale Marine aircraft are stationed.”According to the statement, Captain Launay’s presentation at the Indo-Pacific conference was strictly technical.“Captain Yvan Launay presented the assets of his naval air base, the missions of the Rafale fighter jet, and the French carrier strike group concept,” it said.Responding to questions at the event, Launay “neither confirmed nor denied that Indian aircrafts had been shot down” during Operation Sindoor and “refused to comment on possible jamming of the Indian Rafale by Chinese systems.” The Navy added that “he never mentioned the Chinese J10.”These clarifications directly contradicted another claim published by the Pakistani outlet, which had said Launay linked alleged Rafale performance issues to operational shortcomings and compared the jet with the Chinese J-10C. The Navy reiterated that such references were never made.The BJP spokesperson and its IT cell chief Amit Malviya reacting to the post by French navy called out the Geo TV's report as ""same old, fabricated claims."" He also took a dig at the journalist behind it Hamid Mir.In a post on X he said, ""The French Navy has called out Pakistan’s Geo TV and its correspondent Hamid Mir for spreading “misinformation and disinformation.” In his report, Hamid Mir peddled the same old, fabricated claims about Rafales and the so-called May conflict and has now been publicly exposed. When official institutions start debunking their propaganda, you know how desperate Pakistan’s misinformation machinery has become. Incidentally Hamid Mir has several friends in Indian media. Spot them.""France’s rebuttal comes days after a US report by US-China Economic and Review Commission exposed how in aftermath of Operation Sindoor, China initiated a “disinformation campaign” to “hinder the sales of French Rafale aircraft in favour of its own J-35s, using fake social media accounts to propagate AI images of supposed debris from the planes that China’s weapon destroyed.”The Operation Sindoor was launched in response to the dastardly Pahalgam terror attack in Jammu & Kashmir on April 22 earlier this year, in which 26 civilians were killed - the incident later prompted Indian response targeting Pakistan-sponsored terrorist sites.",French navy slams Pakistan's misinformation campaign about India's Operation Sindoor.

NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday said the borders ""can change"" as he hinted that Sindh, which went to Pakistan during Partition, could ""return to India again someday,"" stressing the region's deep civilisational ties with the country.Speaking at an event, he said, “Today, the land of Sindh may not be a part of India, but civilisationally, Sindh will always be a part of India. And as far as land is concerned, borders can change. Who knows, tomorrow Sindh may return to India again.”The minister referred to the Sindh province along the Indus River, noting that many Sindhi families migrated to India after 1947. Citing former deputy PM and BJP stalwart LK Advani, he said Sindhi Hindus of that generation had never fully reconciled with the separation.“Lal Krishna Advani wrote in one of his books that Sindhi Hindus, especially those of his generation, still haven't accepted the separation of Sindh from India,” Singh said.He cited Advani to underline that the Indus River’s importance goes far beyond geography. “Not just in Sindh, but throughout India, Hindus consider the Indus River sacred. Many Muslims in Sindh also believed that the water of the Indus was no less sacred than the Aab-e-Zamzam of Mecca.This is Advani ji's quote.”Reiterating the emotional link, Singh said, “Our people of Sindh, who hold the Indus River sacred, will always be our own. No matter where they are, they will always be ours.”Also read: French navy slams Pakistan media over misinformation on Operation Sindoor; calls Rafale claims fabricated Singh also recalled his efforts to provide proper citizenship via law to various immigrant Sindhi families after his visit to the community in Delhi back in 2019, describing their living conditions as ""distressing."" He went on to add that because of NDA being in minority in Rajya Sabha back then, the bill collapsed in the upper house, but Amit Shah taking over the home affairs continued the work in the direction, a possible reference to Citizenship Amendment Act.""People from the Sindhi community and various other non-Muslim groups had fled to Delhi, where they were living in slums in extremely distressing conditions. I personally went to see them. After returning, I decided that we would enact whatever laws were necessary to grant them proper citizenship. I spoke to Prime Minister Modi and apprised him that I was moving forward in this direction. The bill was prepared, I introduced it in the Lok Sabha, and it was passed there. But it was the final phase of 2019, only a few months were left, and we did not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha. I spoke to several opposition leaders, but they refused to support it. I said that if it didn’t pass that year, it would certainly be passed the next year. Later, when Amit Shah became the Home Minister, I spoke to him, and he took the work forward,"" he added.Earlier in September while interacting with the Indian community in Morocco, Singh had expressed confidence that Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) would integrate with India “without aggressive steps”.“PoK will be ours on its own. Demands have started being made in PoK, you must have heard sloganeering,” he had said then.","Defence minister Rajnath Singh said the borders ""can change"" as he hinted that Sindh, which went to Pakistan during Partition, could ""return to India again someday"" Citing former deputy PM and BJP stalwart LK Advani, he said Sindhi Hindus had never fully reconciled with the separation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125521493,imgsize-609930,width-400,resizemode-4/defence-minister-rajnath-singh-pti.jpg"

DEHRADUN: In a significant show of combat readiness, Indian Army 's Western Command carried out a month-long integrated ground and air drill involving over 20,000 personnel, simulating offensive operations across the Pakistan border in Punjab.The exercise, which was first of its kind held in Uttarakhand by the Army, concluded near Haridwar on Saturday and was held in terrain mimicking the riverside plains of Punjab.The 'Ram Prahar' exercise was conducted by the Ram division of the Kharga Corps under Western Command. Though the location operationally falls under Central Command, army officials said it was chosen due to geographical similarities with the Punjab sector. The exercise included fighter jets, reconnaissance aircraft, Apache attack helicopters, amphibious armoured vehicles, tanks, drone-based surveillance, and night-time paratrooper deployment.General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of Western Command, Lieutenant General Manoj Kumar Katiyar, who inspected and validated the final phase of the drill, said it focused on rehearsing responses to major provocations by Pakistan.""In the recent Operation Sindoor, we delivered a robust response, which resulted in extensive damage to Pakistani forces. But we doubt whether it has learnt any lesson. If there is another mischief by it, we are prepared to respond with far greater force, including entering Pakistan from Punjab,"" he said. He added that the location was selected as it allowed simulation of riverine obstacles similar to those found in Punjab. ""We conduct exercises in operational areas under other commands too to ensure readiness,"" he said.A senior Army officer involved in the exercise told TOI, requesting anonymity, that the drill tested operational agility, multi-domain capabilities and real-time coordination across land, air and cyber domains.Lt Gen Mohan Bhandari (retired), former deputy director general of military operations during the Kargil war, told TOI the drill was vital to test preparedness for the Punjab sector.""Pakistan has constructed numerous canals in Punjab to act as barriers against our armoured and mechanised units.

NEW DELHI: The fatal crash of an Indian Air Force Tejas fighter jet at the Dubai Air Show 2025 has prompted defence experts to raise the possibility of a “G-force blackout”, after visuals showed the aircraft abruptly losing height during a low-altitude manoeuvre before plunging to the ground. Wing Commander Naman Syal, who was piloting the aircraft, died in the incident.Defence expert Captain Anil Gaur (Retd.) said the nature of the crash suggested the pilot may have lost control during the manoeuvre or experienced a blackout linked to high gravitational forces. Speaking to ANI, he said, “It is sad that our Tejas jet was crashed during the Dubai air show and our brave pilot lost his life. From the visuals, it seems that the jet lost control during the acrobatics, or there might have been a pilot blackout. Blackout here means the excessive gravitational force.” He added that pilots wear G-suits to prevent blood from pooling in their legs, and only data retrieved from the cockpit would confirm what happened.The Indian Air Force said the aircraft went down during an aerial display on Friday, adding, “An IAF Tejas aircraft met with an accident during an aerial display at the Dubai Air Show today. The pilot sustained fatal injuries in the accident.IAF deeply regrets the loss of life and stands firmly with the bereaved family in this time of grief.”A court of inquiry has been ordered.The Dubai Media Office said emergency teams “responded rapidly to the incident and are currently managing the situation on-site”.Also Read: IAF pilot dies as Tejas fighter crashes at Dubai air show Back in Himachal Pradesh’s Kangra district, the death of Wing Commander Syal has left his home village of Patiyalkar grief-stricken.

"BJP objects to Muslim intake in Vaishno Devi Medical College, stirs row",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-objects-to-muslim-intake-in-vaishno-devi-medical-college-stirs-row/articleshow/125524776.cms,"Representative image

SRINAGAR: BJP, VHP and Bajrang Dal have objected to admissions of Muslim students, mostly from Kashmir, to Mata Vaishno Devi Medical College in Katra after freshers from the community formed the bulk of the institution’s first batch.This marks a potential new Jammu versus Kashmir political row as J&K’s governing National Conference (NC) and opposition PDP have slammed the objections. Although the college filled seats strictly on NEET’s merit list and reserved 85% of its seats for J&K domiciles, only eight Hindu students from Jammu made it to the first MBBS batch of 50.After the admissions were completed earlier this month, VHP and Bajrang Dal were the first to protest, arguing that an institution funded by Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board should give preference to Hindus only. They also insisted that the college, funded through donations from Hindu devotees, should serve Hindus’ interests.On Saturday, BJP’s Sunil Sharma formally lodged a protest with J&K lieutenant-governor (LG) Manoj Sinha, who is ex-officio chairman of the shrine board, submitting a memorandum seeking corrective measures and a review of admission norms.Without seeking minority status for the medical college, Sharma made it clear that his party had objected to the intake of “the majority of students from a particular community”.“Donations to the shrine board come from Hindus, for the welfare of Hindus. We are upset with the board and the college because they did not consider this sentiment. We told the LG that only those who have faith in Mata Vaishno Devi should get admission. This year’s admission is not acceptable to people here. The rules should be changed,” Sharma said.In Kashmir, where medical studies are preferred by many, BJP’s protests have not gone down well. “If hospitals, schools, universities, and medical colleges start deciding intakes on the basis of religion, what kind of country will we become? Tomorrow, will a patient be treated according to their faith? Will merit be pushed aside to satisfy majoritarian demands? This is a recipe for disaster,” NC MLA and spokesperson Tanvir Sadiq said.BJP’s stance on Vaishno Devi Medical College, where selections are purely merit-based, is not just misguided but dangerous, Sadiq argued. “A shrine-funded institution does not become a religion-based institution. Donations made out of devotion cannot be converted into tools of discrimination,” Sadiq added, urging BJP not to turn our institutions into “battlegrounds of faith”.PDP’s Iltija Mufti criticised BJP’s stand but did so while taking a dig at NC and its CM Omar Abdullah. “In ‘Naya Kashmir’, discrimination towards Muslims now extends to education. The irony is that this anti-Muslim apartheid is being legitimised and carried out in India’s only Muslim majority state with its only Muslim chief minister,” Iltija said.Peoples Conference chairman and legislator Sajad Lone alleged that BJP’s stance amounted to “experimenting with the concept of communalising medical sciences”. “I hope they understand there is a proper admission test called NEET. And that is an all-India test,” Lone said.","BJP, VHP and Bajrang Dal have objected to admissions of Muslim students to Mata Vaishno Devi Medical College in Katra.

NEW DELHI: After the decimation in Bihar, Congress has upped the ante on ""vote chori"" as the issue of focus, with the brass collectively slamming SIR on Sunday as an ""attempt to manipulate"" voters' lists, and packing the party schedule with protests. This has put in shade the demonstrations by Congress members in Patna who are accusing election managers of bungling ticket distribution, and the general dissenting voices seeking ""introspection"" on the defeat.On Sunday, Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi slammed the ""hasty"" special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in the wake of growing cases of deaths of BLOs.Rahul said, ""Chaos has been wrought upon the country in the name of SIR. Sixteen BLOs have lost their lives in three weeks. Heart attacks, stress, suicide - SIR is not a reform, it is an imposed oppression."" He said citizens were having to find their names in 22-year-old voter lists running into thousands of pages, and this was aimed at tiring out genuine voters into giving up so that ""vote chori"" continued unabated. ""This is not a failure, it is a conspiracy; democracy is being sacrificed to protect power,"" Rahul said.Kharge said the ""hasty SIR"" was reminiscent of unplanned ""demonetisation"" and ""lockdown"".Congress on Sunday directed its state units to observe upcoming ""samvidhan divas"" on Nov 26 as ""samvidhan bachao divas"" over SIR. Congress has already announced a mass rally in the capital on Dec 14 to mark the culmination of its nationwide ""signature campaign"" against ""vote chori"".Amid the unifocal agenda, the party has not moved to look at the Bihar election management after the massive defeat, an issue that is riling many within. Facing criticism are AICC in-charge Krishna Allavaru and the state brass but also the main strategists. It is felt that concern over SIR can go along with a serious relook at how the party contests elections, which could pave the way for a rethink that helps Congress in the future.The fact that Congress lost at least four elections that it was expected to win in the last couple of years has caused unrest among many who were hoping for ""honest analysis"" in the wake of the performance in Bihar. ""How will we improve if we don't look at our mistakes,"" said a neta, who stated that airing dissenting opinions was not going to matter anymore.The review meeting held by the top brass the day after the Bihar results blamed ""electoral irregularities"" for the disastrous outcome - viewed as the reason why not many dissenting voices have come out barring those given in the immediate wake of the defeat. ""We don't think anyone at the AICC even took note of those demonstrations in Patna,"" a key party manager said.","Congress has upped the ante on ""vote chori"" as the issue of focus.

"In a 1st, SC goes all-swadeshi in Presidential reference opinion",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-a-1st-sc-goes-all-swadeshi-in-presidential-reference-opinion/articleshow/125525638.cms,"NEW DELHI: For the first time, a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court in a matter relating to interpretation of constitutional provisions abjured citing rulings of Supreme Courts of foreign countries to buttress their logic and referred only to the SC's past judgments while penning its opinion on the Presidential Reference.CJI B R Gavai, who led the five-judge bench also comprising Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar, said the bench wanted to speak in one voice and support its opinion with 'swadeshi' interpretation of constitutional provisions relating to the power and functions of the President and governors with regard to bills passed by assemblies.Another five-judge bench on Wednesday pronounced a judgment on promotions in judicial services without any of the judges taking credit for authorship. This trend of speaking in one voice, without any single judge taking credit for authoring the judgment, started with Ayodhya verdict. A five-judge bench led by then CJI Ranjan Gogoi didn't have the author's name.For the last six months, Justice Narasimha, since he started presiding over benches, has also rendered judgments without taking authorship credit and passing the verdicts as that of the bench. However, his bench colleague has been persuaded to take credit for judgments authored by him.It is likely that Justice Narasimha could have suggested an unanimous yet anonymous opinion by the five-judge bench on the reference.In the presidential reference opinion, the five-judge bench explained why it did not want to be influenced by foreign judgments. The SC said, ""Copious written submissions and extensive arguments have been employed by counsel to underscore the functioning of the Westminster parliamentary model and its workings in the UK. They sought to draw parallels on the discretionary powers of the Crown and the limitations thereon. ""It added, ""This court believes that our constitutional truth does not lay in either of these extremes but is grounded in the way we have successfully, and if we may add, proudly, worked our Constitution over three quarters of a century. While our constitutional text may have been inspired by comparative outlook, its interpretation and working, we believe, is truly swadeshi.""It explained how the working of India's constitutional federal democracy was different from that of the UK and the US. ""Unlike the English experience of an unwritten constitution, we have a written text. English constitutional law did not have to grapple with vital questions of federalism and an inherently diverse country,"" it said.""The American experience is different due to the strict separation of powers between executive and legislature, necessitating the presidential veto. Indian constitutionalism has evolved to a parliamentary model where legislative agenda, business and enactment is overwhelmingly executed at the behest of the executive,"" it said.","CJI B R Gavai said the bench wanted to speak in one voice and support its opinion with'swadeshi' interpretation of constitutional provisions.

Kashmir doctors’ forum condemns Delhi blast,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kashmir-doctors-forum-condemns-delhi-blast/articleshow/125524856.cms,"Delhi blast

SRINAGAR: Doctors Association Kashmir (DAK) condemned Sunday the Nov 10 blast near Delhi’s Red Fort, saying the medical fraternity stands firmly against violence and any attempt to misuse the profession for destructive ends.The statement by DAK -- Kashmir’s largest doctors’ forum -- came a day after Medical Faculty Association (MFA) of Srinagar’s Government Medical and Dental College became the first doctors’ forum from the Valley to issue such a condemnation. Three Kashmiri doctors are among those arrested over the blast in which 15 people lost their lives.Describing the blast as a “horrifying act of violence” DAK president Dr Mohammad Yousuf Tak said “our hearts go out to the families who are grieving” “Doctors have always worked with humanity, compassion and service above everything, and we will continue to follow these values in every situation. Such acts of terror cannot break our determination to protect and serve our society and our nation,” Tak added, stressing that law should take a “strict course”.Dr. Owaiss H Dar, president of Society of Consultant Doctors J&K, echoed the outrage, saying the medical community is deeply disturbed by the alleged involvement of individuals from the profession. “We have full faith in the justice system and demand strict action against those found guilty. Violence in any form cannot weaken our resolve to serve humanity with dignity,” Dar said.In its condemnation on Saturday, MFA had described the alleged involvement of medical professionals in the blast as troubling, “terming it a desecration of the sanctity associated with the practice of medicine”.",Doctors Association Kashmir condemns the Nov 10 blast near Delhi’s Red Fort.

Hathras murder: UP man kills 60-year-old for 'pressuring' him to marry her; arrested,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hathras-murder-up-man-kills-60-year-old-for-pressuring-him-to-marry-her-arrested/articleshow/125522485.cms,".

NEW DELHI: A man accused of strangling a 60-year-old woman who had allegedly been pressuring him to marry her was arrested on Sunday, police said.The woman’s body, initially unidentified, was discovered on November 14 along a roadside near the Nagla Bhus trisection in the Chandpa area of Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras district, according to police.The woman was later identified as Joshina, 60.Ten teams were deployed to identify the woman and track down the killer. After reviewing footage from nearly 1,000 CCTV cameras across five districts, police traced the suspect, Imran (45), a resident of Tajganj in Agra, a senior officer said.Superintendent of Police Chiranjeev Nath Sinha said Imran had earlier helped arrange the marriage of Joshina’s daughter Mumtaz to Sattar, an Agra resident. Because Imran’s in-laws lived close to Joshina’s home in West Bengal, the two met often and are believed to have developed a relationship, as cited by PTI.According to police, Joshina had travelled from Kolkata on November 10 to attend her granddaughter’s wedding and visited Imran’s house, where she allegedly pressured him to marry her. Imran refused, saying he was already married and had children.Imran, however, refused her proposal as he was already married with children.During interrogation, he told police that on November 13 he left with Joshina on the pretext of escorting her back to Kolkata. Instead, the two boarded a bus to Agra and later got off at the Nagla Bhus trisection in Hathras.Police said Imran confessed to strangling her there to “get rid of her,” and then attempted to stage the scene to mislead investigators by disheveling her clothes before fleeing.Imran was ultimately arrested near the Hatisa bridge in Hathras on Sunday, and police recovered the victim’s phone after he disclosed where he had hidden it, the officer added.","Woman's body discovered on November 14 along a roadside in Uttar Pradesh.

TPUSA Under Fire: Candace Owens Reveals 10 Lies After Charlie Kirk Shooting

Candace Owens links Erika Kirk to Egyptian planes in new claim

Candace Owens On Feminism, Zionism, Who Assassinated Charlie Kirk?





Candace Owens shared new doubts after the death of Charlie Kirk . She said she has not seen any proof that Erika Kirk, Charlie’s wife, has lied about anything. Owens spoke about this on Myron Gaines’ podcast. She said the day before Charlie Kirk was killed, he had sent a message to a person at Turning Point USA about a death threat. Candace Owens said this message made her worry even more about what happened inside the group. She also said some people at Turning Point USA were ready to make Mikey McCoy the “new Charlie,” which she found strange right after Charlie’s death.Candace Owens said Erika Kirk may look quiet or cold to some people online, but she believes this can happen when someone is in shock. She said Erika may be on “autopilot” because she is scared. Candace Owens added that anyone would feel fear after seeing someone close get killed. She also said she has not found anything bad about Erika Kirk in her own checks. After this interview, Ben Shapiro and Steven Crowder said Owens was trying to attack Erika Kirk. Owens pushed back. She said Shapiro lied when he claimed she accused Erika of murder. She said this was made up and not true.Candace Owens also shared a new theory about two Egyptian military planes. She said these planes crossed paths with Erika Kirk’s travel records 73 times from 2022 to 2025. She said one plane was at the Provo Airport on the day Charlie Kirk was shot. Owens said a person helping her check flight paths spent many hours looking at the records and believed the planes were following Erika, not Charlie.Candace Owens said she later checked more files and found even more overlap between Erika Kirk’s travel and the two planes. She said this made her believe that something larger may be happening around the couple. She added these overlaps happened long before Charlie was killed.On the podcast, Candace Owens also questioned the story of the Charlie Kirk's shooter. Police named Tyler Robinson as the person who shot Charlie. Owens said she believes he may be a “patsy.” She claimed more people may have touched the gun and said the full truth has not come out yet.Candace Owens ended by saying she is not blaming Erika Kirk at all. She said her main concern is the group around Charlie Kirk and the strange events linked to the Egyptian planes and the shooting. She said the case still feels unclear and more answers are needed.Also Read: Candace Owens drops explosive claim on Charlie Kirk's assassination with shocking twist about Tyler Robinson fingerprints","Candace Owens shared new doubts after the death of Charlie Kirk.

NEW DELHI: The G20 bloc in South Africa adopted a landmark declaration, unanimously agreed upon despite opposition and boycott by the United States.In a break from tradition, the world leaders adopted the joint declaration at the start of the summit as opposed to concluding day of discussions. The US boycotted the event due to a diplomatic rift with the host country.The 2025 G20 Leaders’ Declaration in Johannesburg under South Africa's presidency centres on climate ambition, debt relief and development justice, with a strong political message on multilateralism, terrorism and global conflicts. The document “unequivocally” condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, aligning with India’s long‑standing demand that there are no “good” and “bad” terrorists.Leaders reiterated support for an open, fair, inclusive and rules‑based multilateral trading system and call for reform of the WTO to make it more responsive to development concerns. It frames everything under South Africa’s theme of “Solidarity, Equality, Sustainability”, with an explicitly pro–Global South tiltAccording to Reuters, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said the US objected to the wording of the declaration.However, he emphasised that it could not be “renegotiated.” His remarks underscored growing tensions between Pretoria and Washington.In opening remarks to the summit, Ramaphosa acknowledged the ""overwhelming consensus and agreement for the declaration. He said, ""There's been overwhelming consensus and agreement that one of the other tasks we should undertake right at the beginning is to adopt our declaration.""Ramaphosa’s spokesperson, Vincent Magwenya, noted that the declaration was adopted unusually early in the proceedings, a move driven by the strong support it received. ""Normally, the adoption of the declaration happens right at the end. But there was a sense that we should actually move to have the summit declaration adopted first as the first order of the day,” Magwenya said, according to AP.The South African officials also confirmed that Trump had put pressure on them not to adopt a leaders' declaration in his absence. ""We had the entire year of working towards this adoption, and the past week has been quite intense,"" the spokesperson said.The declaration statement highlights growing global instability driven by geopolitical rivalries, economic fragmentation, and widening inequalities. It stresses the importance of multilateral cooperation as essential to addressing shared global challenges.The declaration also reaffirms commitment to the UN Charter’s principles, calling on all states to avoid the use or threat of force against the sovereignty or territorial integrity of others.

'We Fly For You': Russian Fighter Pilot's Heartfelt Note For Indian Tejas Pilot After Dubai Crash

SHIMLA: Wing Commander Namansh Syal, who perished in the Tejas crash at Dubai Air Show on Friday, was a high flyer all his life - house captain in Sainik School, Academy Cadet Adjutant (ACC) at National Defence Academy (NDA), and an instructor with Indian Air Force (IAF), training the next generation of combat pilots.The air warrior will be cremated at his ancestral village, Patialkar, in Kangra district's Nagrota Bagwan tehsil, on Sunday, his father Naib Subedar Jagan Nath (retd), an Army Medical Corps veteran, told TOI. In a tragic twist, the 71-year-old said he was searching for videos of his son's aerial acrobatics at the air show when news reports of the crash popped up. Speaking to TOI over phone from Sulur, the grief-stricken father said, ""Then, officers from my son's squadron arrived to convey the tragic news. ""When the family got the news, Namansh's wife, Wing Commander Afshan, was in Kolkata on a training course. Their six-year-old daughter was with her grandparents in Sulur, where Namansh was serving with No. 3 Squadron.The high-achiever was an inspiration for hundreds not only in his hometown but also his alma mater, Sainik School Sujanpur Tira in Hamirpur district, and NDA. The school held a remembrance meet Saturday.He was part of the school's 21st batch, passing out in 2005. Group Captain Rachna Joshi, the school's principal, said: ""Teachers here tell me he was exceptionally well in academics. Joining the school in Class IX and becoming the captain of Chenab House speaks volumes about him. He will continue to remain in our hearts forever as a braveheart,"" said the principal. His 'home' at NDA - Hunter Squadron - also held a remembrance meet.After his Class XII, Namansh enrolled in National Institute of Technology , Hamirpur, but his heart was set on NDA. After his first semester, he cleared SSB and joined NDA 115th course in 2006.

‘Tipu-Ipu ko maro’: Himanta Biswa Sarma backs dropping ‘Great’ from Akbar; row over alleged NCERT move,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tipu-ipu-ko-maro-himanta-biswa-sarma-backs-dropping-great-from-akbar-row-over-alleged-ncert-move/articleshow/125515140.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Saturday backed NCERT’s alleged move to drop the word “Great” from the names of Mughal emperor Akbar and Mysore ruler Tipu Sultan in school history textbooks.Speaking at an event in Bongaigaon, he said, ""Tipu-Ipu ko maro ekdum. Jahan bhejna hai, udhar hi bhej do. Samundar mein phek do"" (Beat up that Tipu. Send him wherever you want to. Throw him in the sea.)Sarma said he had not personally seen the revised textbooks, but if NCERT had made these changes, he welcomed them. A day earlier, RSS leader Sunil Ambekar had claimed that titles like “Akbar the Great” and “Tipu Sultan the Great” had been removed from the books, while stressing that no historical figure had been taken out. The alleged move by NCERT triggered quick political reactions.Congress MP Imran Masood criticised the change, saying it was an attempt to rewrite history and ignore the contributions of rulers who shaped the subcontinent over centuries. He argued that removing titles or names would not change historical facts and pointed to India’s prosperity during parts of their rule.""They ruled the country for 700 years. They didn't rule for just a day or two.You removed their names, but what will the removal or addition achieve? During their rule, GDP was 27 per cent. India was also called the golden bird. They came here and perished here. The last emperor was beheaded, but he did not accept British slavery. He saw his sons' heads adorned on a platter. But he wouldn't accept slavery,"" the Congress MP said.Masood also said those who had “bowed before the British” were now in power, and questioned why descendants of people who “betrayed Rani Lakshmibai” held ministerial posts.Congress leader K Muraleedharan also said the decision to drop the word “Great” from Akbar and Tipu Sultan was unfair. He said Akbar promoted communal harmony and gave Hindus freedom in his rule, while Tipu Sultan fought the British and died because of it.Supporting the revision, VHP spokesperson Vinod Bansal said past textbooks had “distorted” history. He questioned calling Akbar “great” and said such glorification of Mughal rulers was unacceptable.""How can Akbar be great when Maharana Pratap is great? Are Akbar's misdeeds hidden from anyone? The glorification of Babur, Humayun, Akbar, and Aurangzeb cannot be allowed on the sacred land of Maharana Pratap,"" he said, thanking NCERT for the correction.","Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma backs NCERT’s alleged move to drop the word “Great’ from the names of Mughal emperor Akbar and Mysore ruler Tipu Sultan in school history textbooks.

'All Americans At Risk': Chicago Frees 600+ Jailed 'ILLEGAL ALIENS' | Trump Explodes At 'WOKE' Judge

Trump weighs in with claims





One person was killed and at least eight teenagers were wounded in two separate shootings late Friday in Chicago’s Loop, only hours after the city lit its official Christmas tree in Millennium Park.The first incident took place around 9.50 pm (US local time) near State and Randolph streets, close to the Chicago Theatre. Police on patrol heard shots fired into a large crowd in the 100 block of North State Street. Seven teenagers, aged 13 to 17, were taken to Stroger Hospital and Lurie Children’s Hospital. Six were listed in good condition and one in fair condition, according to The New York Times.Shortly afterward, a second shooting occurred on the 100 block of South Dearborn Street. One man later died at Northwestern Hospital, while an 18-year-old was treated for a serious leg wound.Witnesses described chaos as people ran for safety. Linda Dixon, leaving the Chicago Theatre at the time, said, “We almost got knocked in the street, because everyone was running that way. It is very disheartening… Holiday time, everybody wants to celebrate and enjoy the evening, and something like this happens.”Police said no suspects were in custody. Investigations into both shootings are ongoing.US President Donald Trump reacted to the shootings in a post on Truth Social , alleging “massive crime and rioting in the Chicago Loop area” and claiming “multiple police officers” were “attacked and badly injured,” though police have not reported any officer injuries.He criticised Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson for resisting National Guard deployment during unrest linked to the administration’s immigration crackdown.Mayor Johnson condemned the violence, saying such incidents “cannot continue” despite increased police presence. “We have too many guns and too many young people who do not value their lives or the lives of others,” he told CBS News, adding that 300 additional officers would be assigned for Saturday night’s holiday parade.Earlier last month, US President Donald Trump ordered the deployment of around 500 National Guard troops near Chicago, despite objections from Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who criticised the move as an unnecessary militarisation of the cityRich Guidice, former head of the Chicago Office of Emergency Management and Communications and ex–chief of staff to Johnson, argued the city was addressing symptoms rather than root causes. “The parents of these teens must take responsibility. These are young children, under 17 years old,” he said.","One man dead and at least eight teenagers wounded in two separate shootings in Chicago's Loop late Friday.

Germany's Merz Warns Trump On Ukraine Peace Plan Deadline For Zelensky | 'NO DEAL WITHOUT CONSENT'

US insists Ukraine proposal is American plan, not Russian ‘wish list’





US President Donald Trump on Saturday said the US peace plan for ending the nearly four-year Russia-Ukraine war is “not my final offer” to Kyiv, suggesting the Thanksgiving deadline could be extended if progress is made in negotiations. The remarks hint at Washington’s intent to push for a settlement while leaving room for flexibility in talks, amid growing European concerns over elements seen as favouring Moscow.Speaking to the reporters in Washington, Trump said, “Ukraine war should have never happened; ""If I were president, it never would have happened. We're trying to get it ended one way or the other. We have to get it ended"" he added.On being asked if Zelensky rejects the plan, the US President said ""then he can continue to fight his little heart out.""The statement came as European, Canadian, and Japanese leaders at the G20 expressed concern that key elements of the plan including territorial concessions and caps on Ukraine’s armed forces could tilt the balance in Moscow’s favour noting that the draft contained “important elements” for a durable peace but would “require additional work”, citing worries about proposed border changes and limits on Ukraine’s armed forces, the BBC reported.President Volodymyr Zelensky warned Ukraine faced “one of the most difficult moments in our history” as pressure mounted to consider terms critics say favour Moscow.The US State Department on Saturday denied claims by a group of senators that the 28-point plan to end the Ukraine conflict was a “Russian wish list,” insisting that the proposal was authored by the United States, with input from both Kyiv and Moscow, AFP reported.State Department spokesperson Tommy Pigott said on X, “This is blatantly false. As Secretary Rubio and the entire Administration has consistently maintained, this plan was authored by the United States, with input from both the Russians and Ukrainians.”The comments came after senators alleged earlier that President Donald Trump was promoting terms favourable to Russia in the ongoing peace discussions.The US proposal, according to ABC News, would see Ukrainian forces withdraw from parts of Donetsk currently under Kyiv control and accept de facto Russian control of Donetsk and Luhansk, along with recognition of Crimea’s 2014 annexation. It also envisages frozen front lines in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia and would cap Ukraine’s military strength; one draft suggests a limit of about 600,000 personnel and deployment of Western fighter jets in neighbouring Poland.The White House has set a Thanksgiving deadline of November 27 for Kyiv to accept the plan and is sending a delegation to Geneva to begin detailed consultations. ABC reported the US team will include secretary of State Marco Rubio, special envoy Steve Witkoff and Army Secretary Daniel P. Driscoll; a separate meeting with Russian representatives is also planned.At the G20, leaders signed a joint statement noting the draft could be a basis for further work but underlining that “borders must not be changed by force” and expressing concern that proposed limits on Ukraine’s forces would leave it vulnerable to future attack, the BBC reported.Kerry-level and security officials from the UK, France, Germany, the US and Ukraine are due to meet in Geneva on Sunday, according to the BBC, as allies seek to reconcile the US text with Kyiv’s core demands for sovereignty and sufficient defence capability.This comes days after Russian President Vladimir Putin cautiously welcomed the US peace plan for Ukraine, saying it “could form the basis of a final peace settlement,” while criticising Kyiv for opposing it, Reuters reported. Speaking at a meeting of Russia’s National Security Council on Friday, he described Ukraine’s stance as unrealistic.The plan, developed by the United States, incorporates several of Moscow’s long-standing demands, including territorial concessions, a reduction in the size of Ukraine’s armed forces, and a halt to NATO membership ambitions, while offering limited security guarantees. Putin added that although Russia had received the text, it “has not been discussed with us in any substantive way,” suggesting that Ukraine and its European allies “still dream of inflicting a strategic defeat on Russia on the battlefield. Ukraine’s leadership, while saying it is prepared to negotiate, reiterated that any settlement must preserve Ukraine’s security and territorial integrity.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that Kyiv faces a “very difficult choice,” balancing the need to protect its national dignity against the risk of straining key international partnerships. Speaking to the nation, he said Ukraine would continue consultations with the United States and European allies to ensure any agreement is fair. Zelenskyy held a nearly hour-long discussion with US vice president JD Vance and army secretary Dan Driscoll to review the proposed peace plan, acknowledging the intense pressure facing his country.(With inputs from agencies)",US President Donald Trump says peace plan is 'not my final offer' to Kyiv.

What began as a routine check soon spiraled into a heated confrontation. He alleges that officers grabbed him by the shirt collar, shoved him repeatedly, and continued to intimidate him even after he insisted he had done nothing wrong. The agitated auto driver recorded the confrontation on his mobile phone, capturing the officers allegedly manhandling him.Humiliated and overwhelmed, he reportedly walked back to Gandhi Circle, poured petrol on himself and set himself on fire — a desperate act that threw the crowded junction into panic.Onlookers and fellow auto drivers rushed to his rescue and extinguished the flames. He was immediately shifted to the district hospital with 50 percent burns, and doctors later referred him to a superspeciality hospital in Davanagere for advanced treatment.His condition remains serious.Witnesses and other auto drivers claimed this was not an isolated incident but the breaking point after repeated episodes of harassment and verbal abuse by traffic personnel. Within minutes, dozens of auto drivers gathered at Gandhi Circle, raising slogans against the police and demanding action from the Superintendent of Police.Superintendent of police Ranjith Kumar told media persons that the driver had been stopped for a drunk-driving check, during which a dispute erupted.Although the duty officer informed him that a police sub-inspector would address the matter, Thippeswamy left the spot and returned around 9:50 pm. While trying to scare the police by threatening self-immolation, he accidentally set himself on fire, according to the police officials.A PSI has been tasked with examining video footage and investigating the sequence of events.","The man, identified as Thippeswamy, poured petrol on himself and set himself ablaze near the busy Gandhi Circle.

Usha Vance Breaks the Internet: Awkward Body Language & Bare Finger Raise Eyebrows





Second Lady Usha Vance addressed speculation about her marriage to US Vice President JD Vance after she was photographed without her wedding ring during an official visit to Camp Lejeune with First Lady Melania Trump on November 19.A spokesperson for Usha Vance told People magazine that she is “a mother of three young children, who does a lot of dishes, gives lots of baths, and forgets her ring sometimes,” offering a straightforward explanation for the missing ring.As the discussion continued online, zoomed-in images of her hand circulated. The spokesperson said that there was no deeper meaning behind the moment and noted that Usha often removes her ring while looking after her children and completing daily chores. Usha, 39, and JD Vance, 41, have been married since 2014 and have three children—Ewan, 8; Vivek, 5; and Mirabel, 3.The latest rumours followed a separate viral moment in late October involving JD Vance and Erika Kirk, widow of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, at a Turning Point USA event. Kirk, who now leads the organisation, delivered an emotional introduction, saying she saw “similarities” between her late husband and the vice president.Their subsequent hug drew scrutiny online, with viewers dissecting their hand placements and questioning whether the embrace was appropriate given the context of recent grief. Kirk has previously described both JD and Usha Vance as “incredible people” who provided meaningful support after her husband’s death.JD Vance also received criticism for saying he ""hopes"" his Hindu-born wife might “eventually” feel drawn to Catholicism, while adding that the decision would be her own.","Usha Vance was photographed without her wedding ring during an official visit to Camp Lejeune with First Lady Melania Trump on November 19.

Nov 23 Chandigarh - AI City News

Non-BJP parties join hands to oppose Centre’s move

CHANDIGARH: Central govt seeks to bring Union Territory of Chandigarh under Article 240 of Constitution by tabling the 131st Amendment Bill in winter session of Parliament, similar to other UTs like Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, and Daman and Diu.The politically sensitive move has sparked a storm of protest in Punjab, from governing AAP to opposition Congress and Shiromani Akali Dal.“This amendment is against the interests of Punjab. We strongly oppose it and won’t allow this conspiracy being hatched by central govt against Punjab to succeed. Only Punjab has the right over Chandigarh, which was built by destroying the villages of our Punjab. We will not give up our rights. We will take whatever steps are necessary for that,” CM Bhagwant Mann posted on X.Chandigarh is administered by the Punjab governor. With the new law, it is likely to be administered by an independent administrator. The move is being seen as a bid to delink Chandigarh from Punjab. It may open another Punjab vs Delhi war soon after the skirmish over restructuring of Panjab University senate in which Centre took a U-turn.Chandigarh was designated a Union Territory in 1966 and has since been governed directly by central govt rather than Punjab or Haryana, even though it serves as the two states’ joint capital. The role of Chandigarh administrator has been held by the Punjab governor since 1984. Earlier this year, Centre abolished the post of “advisor to administrator” and redesignated it as “chief secretary”.The Article 240 move has brought together non-BJP parties who see it as an attempt to “snatch” Chandigarh from Punjab.Punjab LoP Partap Singh Bajwa urged political parties in Punjab to unite against BJP-led Union govt’s “highly sensitive amendment”. “This Bill is a clear attempt to weaken Punjab’s historical, constitutional, and emotional claim over its own capital,” he said, accusing Centre of eroding Punjab’s rights “whether on Chandigarh, river waters, or Panjab University”.“BJP-led Centre’s antiPunjab agenda is now out in the open.Because Punjabis do not elect BJP, Centre seems intent on penalising state. This mindset is discriminatory, divisive, and completely unacceptable,” he asserted. Bajwa sought to remind Centre of the farmers’ movement and Panjab University Bachao Morcha as recent examples of Punjab’s collective strength.Punjab Congress president Amrinder Singh Raja Warring warned Centre against the proposed 131st Constitutional Amendment. Calling the move “totally uncalled for”, he expressed hope better sense would prevail in Centre and that it would refrain from legislating such a provision. “Chandigarh belongs to Punjab, and any attempt to snatch it away will have serious repercussions,” he cautioned, adding central govt should not make such a misadventure and must make necessary amendments in the proposed Bill.Senior Congress functionary Pargat Singh saw it as “part of a pattern”, and said, “The assault has been years in the making — pushing for a separate Haryana assembly inside Chandigarh, plotting to convert Panjab University into a central university, reducing Punjab-cadre officers in Chandigarh administration, dissolving Panjab University’s elected senate, and now using Article 240 to turn Chandigarh into a regular UT, completely severed from Punjab. It’s a blatant, unconstitutional attack on Punjab’s capital and federal rights.”Rajya Sabha MP Vikramjit Singh Sahney stressed Punjab’s claim on Chandigarh had historical significance as it became Punjab’s capital after Partition when Lahore went to Pakistan. Following the 1966 Punjab Reorganisation, the city became the shared capital of Punjab and Haryana and, under multiple accords, Centre promised to transfer Chandigarh to Punjab. Sahney urged all MPs from Punjab to immediately meet the Union home minister.","Central govt seeks to bring Union Territory of Chandigarh under Article 240 of Constitution by tabling the 131st Amendment Bill in Parliament.

Coup-case turn: Ex-Brazil president Bolsonaro says 'hallucinations' led to ankle-monitor tampering; denies escape attempt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/coup-case-turn-ex-brazil-president-bolsonaro-says-hallucinations-led-to-ankle-monitor-tampering-denies-escape-attempt/articleshow/125529851.cms,"Photo credit: AP





His claim comes a day after his arrest in Brasília, as the Supreme Court prepares to vote Monday on whether to uphold his pre-emptive detention, reported AP.Bolsonaro was detained early Saturday after security officials detected that his device had been tampered with shortly after midnight. Justice Alexandre de Moraes authorised the arrest, citing fears the former leader might try to flee to a foreign embassy ahead of beginning the 27-year sentence he received in September for plotting to overturn the 2022 election. According to The Guardian, the 70-year-old denied he had been planning to flee his rented mansion, where he has been under house arrest since August.At the hearing, assistant judge Luciana Sorrentino said Bolsonaro reported suffering hallucinations and paranoia after starting a strong painkiller and an antidepressant. According to a Supreme Court document cited by AP, he said he believed the monitor contained “some wire tap” and tried to uncover it. He also said he did “not remember having a breakdown of this magnitude before.”Before offering the explanation about a psychotic episode, Bolsonaro had initially told officials he had tried to open the monitor because he wanted to inspect it, footage showed, using a soldering iron that left the device’s cap heavily damaged.He insisted he was not attempting to escape and said the episode occurred late at home while his daughter, elder brother and an aide were present. He claimed he stopped tampering around midnight.Political observers and foes have questioned his shifting account, especially as footage shows Bolsonaro telling a security official he had interfered with the device earlier.Federal police executed the arrest order around 6 am on Saturday and transferred Bolsonaro to a federal police base, where he remains held. He has been under house arrest since August.Bolsonaro’s lawyers again asked that he be returned to house arrest on health grounds, a request De Moraes has repeatedly rejected. The justice, however, did authorise a visit from former first lady Michelle Bolsonaro.Bolsonaro’s detention comes days before he was expected to begin serving the 27-year, three-month sentence for attempting to block Lula from taking office. Although convicted, he had not yet received a final arrest warrant while some appeals were pending. He remains barred from running for public office until 2030.","Bolsonaro was detained early Saturday after security officials detected that his device had been tampered with shortly after midnight.

Xi 'Teases' Japan On War: Chinese Cutters Storm Into Taiwan Waters For Showdown | 'GO AWAY ELSE...'





Japan’s defence minister Shinjiro Koizumi on Sunday announced plans to deploy surface-to-air missiles on the country’s westernmost island of Yonaguni remain on schedule, emphasising that the move aimed to reinforce deterrence rather than raise regional tensions.His remarks came during a visit to the strategically located base, 110 km east of Taiwan, amid continued sparring between Tokyo and Beijing over security issues linked to the island and as diplomatic friction lingers over prime minister Sanae Takaichi’s recent Taiwan-related comments, The Japan Times reported.“The deployment can help lower the chance of an armed attack on our country,” Koizumi told reporters as he inspected the Yonaguni base. “The view that it will heighten regional tensions is not accurate.”Tokyo is pressing ahead with stationing medium-range surface-to-air missiles on Yonaguni as part of a broader military build-up across Japan’s southern island chain, reflecting its deepening concerns over China’s expanding military reach and the risk of a Taiwan contingency. Those concerns have been sharpened by a diplomatic row triggered by Takaichi’s remarks suggesting Japan could theoretically cooperate with other nations militarily if China attacked Taiwan — comments that drew a sharp rebuke and economic retaliation from Beijing, Bloomberg reported.Before arriving on the island, the minister toured bases on Ishigaki and Miyako — key nodes in Japan’s defence posture. Ishigaki hosts anti-ship missiles, while Miyako houses air-surveillance units and ammunition facilities. Further east, Okinawa contains major Japanese and US military installations.Yonaguni marks the western end of the Ryukyu island chain. As regional tensions have risen, Chinese state-controlled media have published articles questioning Japan’s sovereignty over the islands by citing the historic Ryukyu kingdom’s past independence. While few residents of Okinawa Prefecture seek independence today, many remain wary of being drawn into a conflict if military sites on the islands become targets.Despite being a popular diving destination, Yonaguni is a vital surveillance hub, equipped with radar that monitors nearby seas and airspace, as well as an electronic-warfare unit introduced in 2024 to disrupt enemy communications and guidance systems. In recent weeks, the US military conducted an exercise moving supplies from Okinawa to Yonaguni to simulate establishing a forward-operating base during a crisis. Koizumi refused to comment on the potential impact on Yonaguni in such a scenario, saying he would not address “hypothetical” situations.The island’s vulnerability was underscored in 2022 when China, responding to then US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan, launched military drills that saw ballistic missiles land just south of Yonaguni.Meeting the island’s mayor, Koizumi said Japan must continue strengthening its Self-Defence Forces while deepening coordination with the US. “Today, Japan faces the most severe and complex security environment since the end of World War II,” he said. “To protect the peaceful livelihoods of the Japanese people — including everyone here on Yonaguni — we must strengthen the Self-Defense Forces’ capabilities.""","Defence minister Shinjiro Koizumi says plans to deploy surface-to-air missiles on Yonaguni remain on schedule.

‘THIS IS VIOLENCE’: Global Backlash As Brazil Opens Amazon To Oil Drilling On COP30 Eve





A fire broke out at the COP30 climate summit in Belem, Brazil, on Thursday, forcing thousands of delegates to evacuate and halting negotiations at a critical moment in the two-week conference.Ironically, the blaze appears to have been caused by electrical equipment, likely a microwave — showing that even a summit dedicated to climate action doesn’t always follow its own rules.The blaze began around 2.00 pm (1700 GMT) in an exhibition pavilion. Security footage later showed flames racing up an internal fabric shell lining the walls and ceiling, burning a hole through the roof as smoke filled the corridors and people ran for the exits shouting “fire!”Firefighters said the incident was brought under control within six minutes. Nineteen people were treated for smoke inhalation and two for anxiety, according to the Brazilian presidency of the event.Firefighters and ambulances arrived with sirens blaring as smoke rose from the tents and permanent buildings hosting diplomats, journalists, and activists. The affected area was sealed off with a large sheet, and delegates were escorted in one by one to retrieve belongings, including passports needed for evening flights.Plenary sessions will not resume until Friday.It was the third major incident since the summit began last week, following peaceful demonstrations by Indigenous protesters who first stormed the venue and later blockaded the entrance. COP30 hosts Brazil and United Nations Climate Change said in a joint statement that security responded “swiftly” and the blaze was controlled quickly.After a fire department inspection, Brazil declared the site reopened at 8.40 pm.The disruption hit at a delicate stage in the negotiations, with ministers struggling to break a deadlock over fossil fuels, climate finance, and trade measures. Delegates remain divided over Brazil’s proposed “roadmap” to transition away from fossil fuels, as well as concerns about weak emissions-reduction plans and funding for developing nations.Earlier in the day, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned negotiators that “the world is watching” and urged them to reach an “ambitious compromise.” He also welcomed calls for clarity on the disputed issue of weaning the world off fossil fuels.With less than 24 hours before the summit’s scheduled end, nearly 200 countries are still working to reach consensus. Brazil has described securing a final deal as vital to accelerating global climate action and turning years of promises into meaningful progress.","A fire broke out at the COP30 climate summit in Belem, Brazil, on Thursday, forcing thousands of delegates to evacuate.

NEW DELHI: A 5.5-magnitude earthquake struck central Bangladesh on Friday, killing at least six people and injuring several, AP reported citing officials. The quake, which shook buildings in Dhaka and sent residents fleeing outdoors, was felt across several parts of the country and in neighbouring regions of India including Kolkata.Also read: West Bengal: Strong tremors jolt Kolkata; no damage reported yet The US Geological Survey said the earthquake occurred at 10:38 am, with the epicentre located in the Ghorashal area of Narsingdi district, about 25 kilometres from Dhaka, at a depth of 10 kilometres. Dhaka-based DBC Television reported that six people died in the capital, including three who were killed when a roof and a wall collapsed, and three pedestrians who were struck by falling building railings.Authorities said the tremors caused significant panic in Dhaka, one of the world’s most densely populated cities with more than 30,000 people per square kilometre. Bangladesh’s central region is typically less seismically active than the north and southeast, where interactions between the India and Eurasia plates make earthquakes more common.A separate update from ANI said a 5.5-magnitude quake near Narsingdi was felt widely across Dhaka around 10:40 am and also in parts of India including West Bengal and areas of the northeast.The USGS recorded the event at 10:08 am IST. As per the ANI report, “There have been no reports of casualties or damage so far,” though later official updates confirmed fatalities in the capital.Last month, Bangladesh recorded a magnitude 3.4 earthquake, according to the National Centre for Seismology. Experts note that shallow earthquakes can produce stronger surface shaking because seismic waves travel a shorter distance.Citing USGS figures, The Daily Star reported that a magnitude 4.0 earthquake releases energy equivalent to about 6 tons of TNT, while a magnitude 5.0 quake corresponds to around 200 tons. The energy rises steeply with each magnitude, with a 7.0 quake equalling nearly 199,000 tons of TNT and a 9.0 quake releasing about 99 million tons, comparable to roughly 25,000 nuclear bombs.Bangladesh sits at the junction of the Indian, Eurasian and Burma plates, which move several centimetres each year. The country is intersected by major faults including the Bogura, Tripura, Shillong Plateau, Dauki and Assam faults, placing it within 13 recognised earthquake-prone zones. Regions such as Chattogram, the Chattogram Hill Tracts and Jaintiapur in Sylhet fall within the highest-risk category.Visuals from Dhaka on Friday showed emergency teams assessing damage as authorities monitored aftershocks and structural impacts across the capital.(With inputs from AP and ANI)","A 5.5-magnitude earthquake struck central Bangladesh on Friday, killing at least six people.

'Boycott politics never work': South Africa President reacts to Trump's no-show at G20; US fires sharp response,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/boycott-politics-never-work-south-africa-president-reacts-to-trumps-no-show-at-g20-us-fires-sharp-response/articleshow/125476117.cms,"‘WATCH YOUR TONE!’: Leavitt FUMES After Ramaphosa 'Laughs' At Trump’s Last-minute G20 ‘Scramble’





South African President Cyril Ramaphosa on Friday said the United States had shown signs of reconsidering its G20 boycott, calling it a “positive sign” and insisting that “boycott politics never work,” even as the White House dismissed his claim as “fake news” and accused him of “running his mouth. ”“In a way, we see this as a positive sign because, as I’ve often said, boycott politics never work. It’s always best to be inside the tent than being outside of the tent,” the President added.Ramaphosa said Pretoria had received a last-minute communication suggesting Washington might participate “in one shape or form or other” at the Johannesburg summit. “We have received notice from the United States, a notice which we are still in discussions with them over, about a change of mind, about participating in one shape or form or other in the summit,” he said. “This comes at the late hour before the summit begins. And so therefore, we do need to engage in those types of discussions to see how practical it is and what it finally really means.”The White House rejected any suggestion of a reversal. A senior official said only the acting ambassador, Marc D Dillard, would attend the ceremonial handover of the G20 presidency. “This is fake news. The chargé d'affaires in Pretoria will attend the handover ceremony as a formality, but the United States is not joining G20 discussions,” the official said.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reinforced Washington’s position. “The United States is not participating in official talks at the G20 in South Africa,” she said. She added: “I saw the South African president running his mouth a little bit against the United States and the president of the United States earlier today, and that language is not appreciated by the president or his team.” She noted that Dillard would only “receive that send off at the end of the event” and would not “participate in official talks. ”Ramaphosa reiterated that the United States “needs to be here,” saying: “The United States, being the biggest economy in the world, needs to be here. So it's pleasing to hear that there is a change of approach.”The US boycott follows allegations from Washington that South Africa discriminates against white people and Trump’s claims of violence against white Afrikaner farmers, assertions widely rejected in South Africa. Pretoria said Washington also pressured it not to issue a joint G20 declaration, arguing consensus would be impossible without the United States.Ramaphosa pushed back. “We will have a declaration. The talks are going extremely well. I’m confident we are moving towards a declaration, and they are now just dotting the i’s and crossing the t’s,” he said. “We will not be bullied. We will not agree to be bullied.”The US embassy had separately informed Pretoria that South Africa’s G20 agenda “run counter to the US policy views and we cannot support consensus on any documents negotiated under your presidency.”The summit, the first hosted by an African nation, focuses on debt relief for low-income countries, a just energy transition and securing critical minerals. While leaders including Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin and Javier Milei skipped the event, they sent delegations.Political tensions between the two countries have intensified during Trump’s second term, with high US tariffs on South African goods, Pretoria’s ambassador being expelled and Washington also boycotting the COP30 climate talks in Brazil.Despite the diplomatic friction, US business interests in South Africa remain strong, with more than 600 American companies operating in the country. “The US Chamber of Commerce will use our B20 leadership to foster international collaboration,” chamber head Suzanne Clark said.G20 ambassador Xolisa Mabhongo summed up the stand-off, saying: “The only country that is not in the room is the United States and, of course, it is their choice not to be in the room.”","South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said the United States had shown signs of reconsidering its G20 boycott.

'Not a fundamental change'





PARIS: The US military operation against Venezuelan alleged drug traffickers coupled with threats by Donald Trump for a ground assault against President Nicolas Maduro have troubled European powers who retain strategically located territories in the Caribbean, observers say.The concern of France, the Netherlands and the UK is such that they have started limiting intelligence sharing with Washington about the Caribbean over worries it could be used for strikes that would be considered illegal in their countries, according to officials and sources who spoke to AFP.The UK retains small overseas territories in the Caribbean from the colonial era, while the large islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe as well as French Guiana on the South American mainland are now officially part of France.The Netherlands is the most geographically implicated, with three islands off the coast of Venezuela dubbed the ABC -- Aruba, Bonaire and Curacao -- all part of the kingdom.Venezuela has accused Washington of seeking regime change in Caracas with its military build-up, including an aircraft carrier group, warships and several stealth jets.Washington accuses Maduro of leading a ""terrorist"" drug cartel, a charge he denies.Since September, US forces have killed at least 83 people via air strikes on boats accused of ferrying drugs in international waters, according to an AFP tally of publicly released figures.The United States has released no details to back up its claims that the people targeted in both the Caribbean and eastern Pacific in the more than 20 strikes were traffickers.Trump has said he believes Maduro's days were numbered and on Monday refused to rule out boots on the ground while adding he was open to talks with the leftist leader.""The Dutch are concerned about their ABC islands... located about 50 kilometres (31 miles) off the coast of Venezuela,"" a French military official said, asking not to be named.They ""would find themselves on the front line"" in the event of war, a European military source added, also asking not to be named as they were not authorised to speak on the record.- 'Not currently giving intelligence' -With few options in the face of Trump's resolve, these three countries have decided to stop sharing certain intelligence with Washington, multiple sources said.""We are particularly vigilant regarding the politicisation of our services and human rights violations,"" Erik Akerboom, director of the Dutch civilian intelligence and counterintelligence service, told the newspaper De Volkskrant.""No European country, France included, will send operational intelligence to the Americans in the current situation if they could use it as a basis for a military strike on a ship,"" a senior French police official, Dimitri Zoulas, head of the OFAST anti-drug service, told Radio Caraibes (RCI).This position has not been publicly confirmed by French authorities. But a security source said: ""It is 100 percent clear that Europeans are not currently giving any intelligence to the United States that could lead to a strike.""In the UK, the Times reported that attorney general Richard Hermer, the government's top legal advisor, told ministers to cut off intelligence sharing over fears Trump could ""assassinate"" drug dealers in the Caribbean.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio earlier this month dismissed reports the UK had stopped sharing such intelligence as ""fake news"".Richard Dearlove, former head of the British MI6 foreign intelligence service, told AFP the situation was not unique and avoided Europeans being complicit in an action that was perhaps legal in an American jurisdiction but not in their countries.""It doesn't affect the overall intelligence exchange. It's a local and a specific issue. And it's occurred before in my experience,"" he said.Europeans are aware of the risk of antagonising the Trump administration.""Before saying no to the United States and making it known, we have to think twice, because they provide a lot"" of information to their allies, said a source from a European intelligence service.But the Europeans' contribution to American intelligence work in the field is very limited, said a former US military officer who worked in counter-narcotics operations in the region.The Europeans' restraint has a ""theoretical"" effect because the United States doesn't need the information, according to the French security source.Dearlove insisted that as it is ""strictly speaking a legal problem"" this should not affect the wider picture of transatlantic intelligence sharing.""The CIA understands this extremely well.

Indian-origin 'cocaine lawyer' Deepak Paradkar arrested in Canada for helping ex-Olympian kill FBI witness,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/indian-origin-cocaine-lawyer-deepak-paradkar-arrested-in-canada-for-helping-ex-olympian-kill-fbi-witness/articleshow/125525534.cms,"Indian-origin Deepak Paradkar, also known as 'cocaine lawyer' has been arrested in Canada and will be extradited to the US.



'If you kill this witness, the case will be dismissed'





Deepak Paradkar, a famous defence lawyer in Canada, was arrested and will now be extradited to the US as the US accused him of helping murder a witness who was set to testify against Deepak's client Ryan Wedding, a former Canadian Olympic athlete who turned into a drug lord. Deepak Paradkar is known for his high-profile clients, mostly drug lords, which also makes him popularly known as 'cocaine lawyer'. It was the profile name that he used on social media as he posted photos of clients getting cleared of drug charges.This is the advice that Paradkar gave to Wedding months before an FBI witness was gunned down at a restaurant in Colombia. He was shot five times in the head in January 2025. The former Olympic snowboarder ended up on the FBI's most wanted list for allegedly running a massive drug trafficking empire from Mexico after the US authorities intercepted one of his cocaine shipments in 2024. He was to be extradited from Mexico on criminal charges but Paradkar advised him that if the FBI witness is killed, he would not have to be extradited to the US.After this advice from Paradkar, Wedding paid a Canadian website that publishes crime news to post photos of the witness and his wife to locate them. After he was located in Colombia, he was shot dead. The US indictment claimed that Wedding gave Paradkar luxury watches and additional fees for his illegal services as he was not only providing Wedding legal consultations but was an integral member of Wedding's day-to-day operations, the US indictment alleged.According to the FBI, Paradkar also introduced Weddinng to trusted drug transportation networks and paid other defence attorneys in Canada and the US to look into anyone arrested with Wedding’s drugs. This way, authorities alleged, Paradkar could determine if anyone flipped on Wedding.","Deepak Paradkar, a famous defence lawyer in Canada, was arrested and will now be extradited to the US.

New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani said he believes that President Donald Trump is a 'fascist' and 'despot' but what changed after his first meeting with the president is that he thinks there is an opportunity to work together for New Yorkers.

""That’s OK, you can just say it,” Trump said, saving Mamdani from a difficult situation. ""It’s easier, it’s easier than explaining it,"" Trump added.Trump later clarified that he did not mind being called a 'despot' as he was certain that Mamdani would change his mind when they work together. ""I’ve been called much worse than a despot,"" Trump said.Mamdani addressed the 'fascist' question again and said his answer was 'yes' during the press meet after Trump made his comment.“That’s something I’ve said in the past and I say today. And I think what I appreciated about the conversation that I had with the president was that we were not shy about the places of disagreement, about the politics that has brought us to this moment, and we also wanted to focus on what it could look like to deliver on a shared analysis of an affordability crisis for New Yorkers,"" Mamdani said asserting that he is not in awe of Trump after their first meeting and he continued to believe in all the negative things he said about Trump in the past.“I thought again and again about what it would mean for New Yorkers if we could establish a productive relationship that would focus on the issues that those New Yorkers stay up late at night thinking about,” rather than keep trading barbs, Mamdani said.","New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani said he still believes that President Donald Trump is a 'fascist' and a 'despot' But what changed after his first meeting with the president is that he thinks there is an opportunity to work together for New Yorkers.
