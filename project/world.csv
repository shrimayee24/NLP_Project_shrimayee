Peel regional police arrested and criminally charged three individuals over the incident. ""Earlier today, Peel Regional Police were present at a demonstration held at a place of worship in Brampton.

Indian High Commission in Canada slammed the ""violent disruption"" by 'anti-India' elements outside a consular camp in Brampton and raised concerns over the safety of Indian nationals in the country. The High Commission said that any further events will be organised ""contingent on security arrangements"" made by the local authorities.

The High Commission said that any further events will be organised ""contingent on security arrangements"" made by the local authorities. ""We have seen violent disruption today (Nov 3) orchestrated by outside the consular camp co-organised with the , Brampton, near Toronto,"" the statement read. Canadian Prime Minister Justin said that every Canadian has the right to practice their faith freely and safely. Taking to X, Justin Trudeau thanked the local authorities for the swift response to protect the community and probe this incident. ""The acts of violence at the Hindu Sabha Mandir in Brampton today are unacceptable. Every Canadian has the right to practice their faith freely and safely,"" Trudeau said.

Opposition leader Pierre Poilievre said that the Conservatives condemned the attack and promised to unite the people and end the chaos. ""Completely unacceptable to see violence targeting worshippers at the Hindu Sabha Mandir in Brampton today,"" the opposition leader said.

Attacking the Trudeau administration, Canadian MP Chandra Arya said that he started believing that there is a small grain of truth in the reports that in addition to the Canadian political apparatus, Khalistanis have effectively infiltrated Canada's law enforcement agencies. ""A red line has been crossed by Canadian Khalistani extremists today. The attack by Khalistanis on the Hindu-Canadian devotees inside the premises of the Hindu Sabha temple in Brampton shows how deep and brazen Khalistani violent extremism has become in Canada. I begin to feel that there is a small grain of truth in the reports that in addition to Canadian political apparatus, Khalistanis have effectively infiltrated into our law enforcement agencies,"" he said in a post on X.

Ontario Sikhs and Gurdwara Council also condemned the incident and said that the attack is a distressing reminder of the need for understanding and mutual respect in our community. ""OSGC is committed to ensuring the safety and well-being of all community members and supporting an environment where people can feel safe and respected, regardless of their beliefs. We call upon local authorities to thoroughly investigate this incident, reaffirming that violence has no place in our society. We also encourage community leaders and members to come together, support one another, and foster an atmosphere of unity and compassion,"" the statement read.

The recent attack adds to a series of such incidents in recent years. Earlier, a Hindu temple in Windsor suffered defacement with anti-India graffiti, sparking widespread condemnation and calls for action from both Canadian and Indian officials. Earlier incidents in Mississauga and Brampton saw temples similarly targeted, drawing strong reactions from the Indian community in Canada. In July, Arya had voiced deep concern over the violence directed at Hindu-Canadian communities. In a post on X, he wrote, ""The Hindu temple BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir in Edmonton is vandalised again. During the last few years, Hindu temples in the Greater Toronto Area, British Columbia, and other places in Canada are being vandalised with hateful graffiti.""

International working president in Vishva Hindu Parishad Alok Kumar condemned the attack and said that the incident is a matter of regret and anguish. ""This causes a great concern, more so because the Indian consulate was invited by the Hindu temple to organise a camp there over facilities for Indians travelling to India. The Indian Consulate has informed the police authorities about it and had requested for security. Despite advance information and declining security atmosphere, it is a matter of regret and anguish that Canadian police did not make any arrangements and rioters were given a free run."" Kumar said.

Hours after the incident, city's mayor, Patrick Brown announced that he will be bringing in a motion in the city council to prohibit protesting at places of worship in the city. Brown said he has asked the city solicitor to look into the legality of the law for the next scheduled meeting of city council. ""Places of worship should safe spaces that are free of violence and intimidation. I have asked our City solicitor to look into the legality of such a by-law for our next scheduled meeting of City Council,"" read a post by the mayor on X on Monday.

Indian-American Congressman Shri Thanedar also criticised the Canadian government for what he describes as political manoeuvring and failure to protect Hindu communities amid rising incidents of religious violence. Speaking on recent attacks targeting Hindus in Canada, Thanedar said, ""The Canadian government is playing politics with this issue, they are trying to please certain minority groups in Canada. The attack against Hindus are purely terroristic acts. Canada government's protection of these terroristic activities needs to be deplored, it needs to be opposed."" He stressed the need for Canada to uphold the human rights of Hindu minorities, comparing the situation to the rights struggles faced by Hindu communities in countries like Bangladesh. Thanedar added, ""I have done a lot including putting pressure on the Biden administration to address these atrocities.""

Union minister Ravneet Singh Bittu accused Trudeau of creating divisions among different communities in Canada and said,""The news reports coming in over the past few days, the situation that has formed in Canada do not pertain one particular religion. Be it Hindu or Sikh, PM Justin Trudeau has divided everyone there."" Bittu criticized both those advocating for pro-Khalistan slogans and the Canadian police for their support, stating that the Indian Government will respond to the situation with a more decisive action. ""Khalistanis came outside religious places to disturb people in festive season. Their Police seem to be standing in support of Khalistanis...These will not be tolerated. We will move against the Govt of Canada, wherever we have to approach...These people who are raising Khalistani slogans are on their payroll,"" Bittu said.

The ministry of external affairs (MEA) condemned the recent violence at the Hindu Sabha Temple in Brampton, Ontario, with spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal urging Canada to protect places of worship and bring those responsible to justice. ""We condemn the acts of violence perpetrated by extremists and separatists,"" Jaiswal said, reaffirming India’s commitment to supporting Indian nationals and Canadian citizens amid ongoing intimidation.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi condemned the recent attack on a Hindu temple in Canada, describing it as a ""deliberate"" act and criticising attempts to intimidate Indian diplomats. He affirmed that such acts of violence would not weaken India's resolve and called on the Canadian government to ensure justice and uphold the rule of law.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday voiced a strong condemnation of a recent attack on Hindu temple in Canada, calling it a ""deliberate"" act. He also denounced ""cowardly attempts"" to intimidate Indian diplomats, asserting that such violence would not weaken India's resolve.""I strongly condemn the deliberate attack on a Hindu temple in Canada.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: It was akin to a Diwali surprise - several IAS officers belonging to the Kerala cadre got ""added"" to a new WhatsApp group on October 31, labelled 'Mallu Hindu Officers.'The WhatsApp group, which included only Hindu officers in the cadre, was created from the phone number used by IAS officer K Gopalakrishnan . It led to immediate objections, with many officers finding it inappropriate and contrary to the secular principles that officers are expected to uphold.The WhatsApp group was disbanded a day after its creation, with Gopalakrishnan claiming that his phone was hacked. He stated that multiple groups were formed using his contacts without his consent. It is learnt that the officer also filed a police complaint in this regard.The incident comes on the heels of another high-profile controversy involving senior IPS officer MR Ajith Kumar. Kumar was removed from his position as ADGP (law & order) after it was revealed that he covertly met senior RSS functionaries, allegedly without the knowledge of the LDF govt in Kerala. Though govt has not officially acknowledged this as the reason for his transfer, it was forced to transfer Kumar after even LDF ally CPI took a tough stand on it.""There are several WhatsApp groups among officers, but a WhatsApp group on religious lines is something new,"" a senior officer told TOI, on condition of anonymity. He said WhatsApp groups among officers differentiated between junior and senior officers, are intended for various services and there are others based on different considerations including language, but many of them are largely inactive in nature. A group explicitly created on religious grounds, however, was unprecedented.A senior intelligence officer, also speaking on condition of anonymity, revealed that the agency was alerted about the group by a few officers who were added to it. These officers provided evidence, prompting the agency to take the matter seriously and prepare a report. Intelligence agencies, both at the state and Central levels, are now looking into the matter.","Several IAS officers belonging to the Kerala cadre got ""added"" to a new WhatsApp group on October 31, labelled 'Mallu Hindu Officers' The WhatsApp group was created from the phone number used by IAS officer K Gopalakrishnan.

Humanitarian Access To Gaza: US slams Israel with 'fail' grade for lack of progress on Gaza humanitarian aid,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-slams-israel-with-fail-grade-for-lack-of-progress-on-gaza-humanitarian-aid/articleshow/114962198.cms,"United states secretary of state Antony Blinken

The US government expressed concern over Israel's progress in improving humanitarian access to Gaza , stating Israel has not met the aid targets outlined in a recent letter from top US officials. The Biden administration gave Israel a “fail” grade on its efforts to increase humanitarian aid to Gaza , as reported by the Associated Press.State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Monday that Israel has yet to fulfill the requirements set forth in a letter sent in October by secretary of state Antony Blinken and defence secretary Lloyd Austin. The letter called for Israel to allow a minimum of 350 trucks carrying aid into Gaza daily. However, according to the United Nations , only an average of 71 trucks are entering per day.""We have seen an increase in some measurements,” Miller said. ""but if you look at the stipulated recommendations in the letter — those have not been met.”The US gave Israel a 30-day deadline to implement these changes, which is approaching. While Miller did not specify what actions the US might take if Israel fails to meet the deadline, he said, “we will follow the law.”The situation in Gaza has become a point of contention between the US and Israel, with Blinken and Austin urging Israeli officials to prioritise civilian aid. Blinken spoke directly with Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant on Monday, urging him to “substantially increase and sustain humanitarian aid” to Gaza’s civilians, according to state department.Meanwhile, the Israeli body overseeing Gaza’s aid, COGAT (Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories), reported some progress, evacuating 72 patients from northern Gaza and delivering medical supplies, food, and fuel on Monday. However, the progress falls short of US expectations, drawing disapproval from Washington.On the other hand, the head of Unicef, the UN children’s agency, warned that “the entire Palestinian population in North Gaza, especially children, is at imminent risk of dying from disease, famine, and ongoing bombardments.The US further expressed concern over the rise in violence against Palestinians by Israeli settlers in the West Bank.“These violent actions cause intense human suffering for Palestinians and they threaten Israel’s security. It is critical that the government of Israel deter extremist settler violence and take measures to protect all communities from harm in accordance with its international obligations,"" Miller said.US officials stressed the need for Israel to prevent these incidents, expressing “deep concern” over the issue. They warned that Israeli groups involved in violence against Palestinian civilians could face further sanctions.","The US government expressed concern over Israel's progress in improving humanitarian access to Gaza.

'Living Buddhas'

MANDALAY: Sculptor Aung Naing Lin has spent decades carving Buddha statues to help guide Myanmar's faithful -- but getting the marble he needs from rebel-held quarries in the midst of civil war is now a perilous task.Buddhist-majority Myanmar has been mired in bloody conflict since the military toppled the government of Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021, terminating a 10-year experiment with democracy and sparking a widespread armed uprising.In recent months, opponents of the military have advanced with rocket and drone attacks on Mandalay -- the country's second-biggest city, with a population of 1.5 million.The rebels have also seized the hillside quarries that have for generations provided the marble that adorns Mandalay's palaces and monasteries, as well as the shrines in ordinary homes.Now, moving the precious stone and roughly carved statues by truck across the divide of the civil war, from rebel to junta-held territory, is expensive, difficult and dangerous.""The situation around the Madaya township (where the quarries are located) is not very good,"" Aung Naing Lin told AFP at his noisy workshop in Mandalay, his face and hair speckled with white dust.""It is not easy to go, and we cannot bring the stones back.""Surrounded by dozens of blank-faced Buddha statues waiting to be given eyes, ears and lips, Min Min Soe agreed.""Sales are not that bad, but the challenge is bringing the statues here,"" he said.""We can sell only the statues we have here and we cannot bring new raw statues in.""The owner of another workshop, who did not want to be named, said associates of his were recently arrested when taking a shipment of marble from rebel-held Madaya.""They were detained by the local military column and were asked how they brought the stones out from the village as that area was controlled by the PDF,"" they said.""People's Defence Forces"" are units made up of former students, farmers and workers who have left their lives behind to take up arms and oppose the junta's coup.There are dozens of PDFs across the country, and they have dragged the junta into a bloody stalemate.The junta has designated them as ""terrorists"", and contact with them can bring years in prison.""Later, they released the people who had been detained and gave the stones back,"" the workshop owner said.""It's like a warning to all. We dare not to bring stones from the village under this situation.""The quarries of Madaya have long been interwoven with the cultural and religious history of Myanmar.In the 1860s, following two disastrous wars with the British, then-king Mindon commissioned craftsmen in Mandalay to transfer Buddhist scriptures from palm leaf manuscripts onto 720 blocks of solid marble to ensure they survived any further destruction.The stone also resonates with the military that has ruled Myanmar for much of its history since independence from Britain in 1948.In 2020, it sanctioned the building of a 25-metre (82-foot) high statue of the Buddha made from Madaya marble to adorn its custom-built capital Naypyidaw.Junta chief Min Aung Hlaing declared the statue finished last year and a visit has since become a stock feature of the itineraries of the few foreign delegations that visit the isolated junta.While the fighting continues north of Mandalay, Min Min Soe and others work to put the finishing touches on the dozens of roughly hewn statues.Their forefathers used chisels, but nowadays, craftsmen use drills to etch everything from Buddha's face, the folds in his robe, fingernails and the lotus flower he sits on.The laborious final stages of smoothing the rough edges are done by women using sandpaper, said Min Min Soe.""Women are better at this as they are more patient,"" he said.A finished statue around 25 centimetres (10 inches) high fetches between 100,000 - 200,000 Myanmar kyat ($50-$100 at the official exchange rate), he said.Outside one of the workshops on the busy street, workers packed a sitting Buddha statue into a wooden protective frame before shipping it off to a customer.Min Min Soe says looking after the dozens of his creations still in stock helps him find his own peace amid rumours of an attack on Mandalay.He considers them ""living Buddhas"".""I clean the statues at 4 am every day... This is not only for my business but also to gain merit,"" he said.""I want them to be clean and good-looking no matter if they are sold or not.""",Buddhist-majority Myanmar has been mired in bloody conflict since the military toppled the government of Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021.

The rocket lifted two primary Ionosfera-M satellites aimed at monitoring space weather around Earth, while also deploying 53 smaller satellites, including two from Iran.The Soyuz-2.1 spacecraft’s main payload, the Ionosfera-M satellites, each weighing 430 kg, will orbit 820 kilometers above Earth’s surface. These satellites will form a crucial part of a broader system designed to monitor the ionosphere—a region between 50 to 400 miles above the planet where Earth’s atmosphere meets space.According to Nasa, understanding the ionosphere is vital for space weather forecasting, as this layer influences satellite operations and global communication systems. Roscosmos plans to expand this system to include four Ionosfera-M satellites, with the remaining two scheduled for launch in 2025.Alongside the primary payload, Russia also launched a range of small satellites, including Iran's Kowsar and Hodhod. Kowsar, a high-resolution imaging satellite, and Hodhod, a communication satellite, mark Iran's first private sector launch of space technology. They join previous Iranian satellites launched by Russia, including the Khayyam Earth observation satellite in 2022 and the Pars-1 satellite earlier this year.This launch underscores growing cooperation between Moscow and Tehran, as both nations expand ties across various domains. This comes as the Western nations and Ukraine accuse Iran of supplying Moscow with drones for use in the Ukraine conflict—a claim both governments deny.Iran’s recent satellite launches with Russian support follow a series of setbacks within Iran’s civilian space program. In recent years, the country has faced multiple launch failures, including five consecutive failures with the Simorgh satellite program.Accidents such as the 2019 launchpad fire that claimed the lives of three researchers have hindered Iran’s progress. Furthermore, in October, satellite imagery indicated that a retaliatory Israeli strike likely targeted a military facility used by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard’s space program.The US intelligence community has flagged Iran’s satellite launch vehicle technology as a potential shortcut to developing intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), which can carry nuclear warheads.Following the collapse of the 2015 nuclear deal, Tehran has enriched uranium to near-weapons-grade levels, a situation that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has warned could enable the production of several nuclear weapons if Iran chose to proceed.","Russia's space agency, Roscosmos, successfully launched a Soyuz rocket from the Vostochny Cosmodrome, carrying a dual mission payload.

Driving the news

As Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump race neck-and-neck, officials at every level are preparing to navigate one of the most unpredictable and high-stakes elections in recent US history.

and former President race neck-and-neck, officials at every level are preparing to navigate one of the most unpredictable and high-stakes elections in recent US history. The US government and local authorities have ramped up efforts to combat unprecedented levels of misinformation, potential voter suppression, and threats of violence.

With disinformation from domestic and foreign sources spreading across social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter), public trust in the electoral process has reached a dangerous low, posing risks to voter turnout and post-election stability.

Physical security around polling locations and election offices has reached new heights.

As per a Washington Post report, local governments across swing states like Georgia, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania are fortifying polling sites with everything from bulletproof glass to GPS tracking for ballot drop-offs. They are implementing extensive security protocols to safeguard election sites, with preparations including rooftop snipers to secure a crucial vote-counting facility, panic buttons for election staff, and drones monitoring from above.

Philadelphia’s election budget has nearly tripled since 2019, as officials implemented emergency buttons and enhanced security protocols.

Election workers are cautiously optimistic that the measures will prevent the disruption or harassment seen in previous years. However, as Isaac Cramer, a South Carolina election official, noted, “The cost for securing elections is only increasing day by day because of new threats.”

Why it matters

This election stands out not only for its intense polarization but also for the potential ripple effects of low public trust in the electoral process, a Bloomberg report said.

Recent surveys show a notable decline in confidence in election results, especially among Republicans: while nearly 70% trust their local polling sites, only 28% believe in the integrity of the results nationwide.

This sharp drop in trust mirrors a wider crisis of confidence that has steadily grown since 2020, raising fears that many Americans may abstain from voting or contest results they dislike.

The stakes are high. Experts warn that this distrust, stoked by conspiracy theories and misinformation, may lead to scenarios reminiscent of the post-2020 election unrest. William Pelfrey Jr, a professor specializing in domestic terrorism at Virginia Commonwealth University, told Bloomberg, “Some of these conspiracies don’t make any damn sense, but they’re still propagating and influencing people’s faith in the electoral process.”

Between the lines

The Justice Department, FBI, and other intelligence agencies have coordinated efforts to uncover and publicize foreign attempts to influence public opinion on a scale that contrasts sharply with the Obama administration's quieter approach to Russian interference in the 2016 election. This active disclosure is seen as essential to preserving public trust. George Barnes, former deputy director of the National Security Agency, emphasized that “the government has to position itself to control the narrative,” adding, “You need to act on intelligence … in the public domain.” As a result, the current administration has leaned heavily into exposing election-related disinformation as a means of reassuring voters.

While foreign actors like Russia are amplifying fake content — including a widely debunked video of Haitian migrants supposedly voting in Georgia — domestic actors and prominent influencers are playing an equally significant role. Misinformation narratives echoing former President Donald Trump’s stance on electoral fraud have gained traction online, with major figures like Elon Musk and Trump himself amplifying them. These narratives include false reports of destroyed ballots, claims of blocked polling places, and accusations of non-citizens voting. Musk’s own X platform has become a primary venue for these discussions, with posts that question the legitimacy of the election now reaching millions.

Meanwhile, state and local governments have had to significantly increase their election budgets to address these threats. The Brennan Center for Justice reports that 92% of local election offices have implemented new security protocols, from cybersecurity upgrades to physical enhancements at polling sites. For example, Charleston County in South Carolina has spent over $500,000 on election security since 2020, while Durham County in North Carolina has upped its election budget by $1 million. Durham’s director of elections, Derek Bowens, noted that this year’s budget covers everything from an emergency alert system that allows staff to discreetly call 911 to GPS-tracked vehicles for secure ballot transport.

What’s next

To combat conspiracy theories that could discourage voter participation, election officials are working with tech platforms to prevent false information from going viral, even as these platforms face criticism for their “hands-off” approach to fact-checking. Meta Platforms, for example, has stopped labeling election-related posts and no longer directs users to its voter information center, marking a shift from the proactive stance it took in 2020.

Additionally, states are taking direct measures to bolster public confidence in the integrity of the voting process. Michigan, for instance, passed a constitutional amendment in 2022 to mandate that election officials adhere strictly to procedural guidelines, limiting the potential for contested results based on certification refusal. According to a Michigan state official, “Our goal is to eliminate confusion. Confusion gives rise to the risk of violence.” These measures are aimed at dispelling doubt in a process that is already prone to high-stakes legal and political battles.

Beyond local measures, the Biden administration has made significant updates to federal election laws to prevent scenarios similar to those that led to the January 6 Capitol riot.

The 2022 Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act clarifies that the vice president’s role is “solely ministerial,” closing the loophole that Trump allegedly sought to exploit in 2020. This reform increases the barriers for objecting to certified results, creating a legal framework that limits the capacity for election subversion at the federal level.

With millions of Americans heading to the polls on November 5, the 2024 presidential election is marked by widespread distrust, social media misinformation, and intensified political polarization—creating an atmosphere fraught with tension and volatility.“There’s a lot of crazy going on,” Carah Ong Whaley, director of election protection at Issue One, a nonpartisan think tank focused on electoral policy, told Bloomberg. “We’ve always had false information in elections,” she continued, “but in 2024, the sheer volume of different sets and facts and beliefs about election integrity is at a scale that I don’t think we’ve witnessed in our lifetimes.” Whaley's comments echo concerns across both political and intelligence circles that this election has seen an explosion of election-related disinformation that is eroding public trust in an unprecedented way.In line with these concerns, election officials from battleground states like Georgia, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania are taking steps to safeguard the voting process against disruption. Georgia’s Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger, told Bloomberg that counties across the state are allocating additional resources to “ensure that their election offices are fully staffed and resourced financially.” Election security infrastructure has become a top priority for local governments, especially in swing states where partisan narratives about election interference are the most heated.In states like Pennsylvania, where close contests and high voter turnout are anticipated, officials have established new protocols to prevent and quickly address voting irregularities. For instance, after a misleading video suggesting voter obstruction went viral, Bucks County clarified that it was a miscommunication, not a deliberate restriction, and reassured voters that alternative methods for obtaining mail-in ballots were available. Even so, election monitors and local law enforcement will have a stronger presence at polling locations across key counties to address potential harassment or violence on Election Day.As per the Bloomberg report, officials in other swing states have also heightened security. In Dane County, Wisconsin, a new $20 million election facility featuring bulletproof glass and secure storage is under construction. County Clerk Scott McDonell said, “Some people have nice, secure places for their stuff and others — their machine’s in a broom closet. The new building would change all that. We’d have one secure facility for everything.”(With inputs from agencies)","The US government and local authorities have ramped up efforts to combat unprecedented levels of misinformation, potential voter suppression, and threats of violence.

Implications of a tied election



A tie in the US presidential election, with neither Kamala Harris nor Donald Trump reaching the 270 electoral votes needed to win, remains unlikely yet possible. If such a situation erupts which is unlikely to happen here’s how an Electoral College deadlock would unfold and what it means for the election outcome.In US presidential elections, the president is chosen not by the national popular vote, but by a 538-member Electoral College. Each state’s electoral votes reflect its Congressional representation: two senators plus a number of House representatives based on population. Thus, each state holds a different number of electoral votes.Most states, except Maine and Nebraska, use a “winner-takes-all” approach, awarding all electoral votes to the candidate who wins the state’s popular vote.Also read: How presidential polls unfold, breaking down road to the White House To illustrate, let’s look at Florida, a state with 29 electoral votes.Thus, Florida’s 29 electoral votes significantly contribute to a candidate’s path to 270, especially in a close race.In the unlikely event that both candidates end up with 269 electoral votes, the election decision moves to Congress, as the US Constitution dictates. Specifically, the newly elected House of Representatives would choose the president, and the Senate would select the vice president.A 269-269 tie in the Electoral College, though unlikely, could arise under specific scenarios. For instance, if Kamala Harris wins key states like Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, while Donald Trump secures Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina, and a single congressional district in Nebraska, each candidate would end up with exactly 269 electoral votes. This deadlock would trigger a contingent election, as no candidate would have reached the required 270 out of 538 Electoral College votes.In this case, a “contingent election” would be held in Congress on January 6, 2025.The last contingent election was in 1800, when a tie between Thomas Jefferson and John Adams led the House to decide the presidency after 36 ballots. This contentious process ultimately led to the 12th Amendment, which refined the rules but left the possibility of a tied election open.If a tie were to happen today, a contingent election would introduce intense uncertainty. The House would need to establish rules for the process, likely sparking partisan disagreements. Combined with an already divisive campaign, this could deepen political tensions among American voters, many of whom might already be skeptical about election integrity.In short, a tie in the US presidential election would transfer the decision to Congress. Each state delegation in the House would cast a single vote for the president, while the Senate would select the vice president. This rare scenario would introduce a period of political tension and uncertainty increasing the complexities of the US Electoral College system.","In US presidential elections, the president is chosen not by the national popular vote, but by a 538-member Electoral College.

Concerns over censorship and free speech

Tech mogul Elon Musk made a surprise appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, where he accused the Democratic Party of hypocrisy and spreading misinformation. During the conversation, Musk also weighed in on the ongoing allegations against former President Donald Trump, dismissing them as ""hoaxes"" and drawing comparisons to authoritarian tactics.The podcast appearance comes after both Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, appeared on Rogan's show in the past week. Musk, who has been actively campaigning for Trump in Pennsylvania, once again reiterated this claim that ""if Trump doesn’t Win, this will be the last real election"".Musk talked about what he sees as a dangerous government approach to justice, referencing Lavrentiy Beria, Stalin’s infamous secret police chief notorious line, “Show me the man and I’ll show you the crime.” He compared the tactic to the treatment of his company, SpaceX, claiming authorities had arbitrarily targeted it, then found reasons to investigate. “They decided SpaceX was the target,” Musk said. “They just figured out the crime afterwards.”Rogan agreed, pointing out that critics of Trump have accused him of wanting to weaponise the justice system if re-elected, yet Musk argued that it was the Democrats who had already done so. ""They’re doing all the things they accused Trump of doing—openly,"" Musk said. He contended that while some political exaggeration is normal, the Democrats have repeatedly “pushed hoaxes” to undermine Trump.""I mean the sheer number of hoaxes that the Democratic Party is pushing over and over again... When you have deliberate concerted repeated pushing of hoaxes you're like wait a second. Like come on man this is too far,"" Musk said.Musk and Rogan cited several specific examples, including the ""fine people"" remark Trump made regarding Charlottesville, which Musk claims is often misinterpreted. He criticised former President Barack Obama for recently bringing up this narrative again, suggesting it was used as a tool to demonise Trump. “It’s a flat-out lie,” Rogan remarked.Musk also lashed out a campaign ad from Vice President Kamala Harris that allegedly misconstrued Trump’s comments on border security to imply he was denying women’s rights. Musk described the tactic of clipping Trump’s statements out of context, citing a saying, “They’ll take like not even a full sentence … and then push it on every ad, every speaking event, every media.”The Tesla CEO also voiced concern over what he sees as the left's shift towards authoritarianism. He claimed that while he was once aligned with progressive values, he now feels the Democratic Party has become oppressive, particularly regarding free speech.According to Musk, efforts to silence opposition on certain topics are reflective of an agenda to control public opinion. ""If they’re trying to suppress people’s ability to communicate, they’re only doing that because they want to do things that people don’t want them to do,"" he said.Musk also called out the traditional media, accusing it of exploiting “low-information voters” who, due to time constraints, might not scrutinise political claims deeply. He argued that these voters are easily misled by selectively presented narratives. As an example, he cited MSNBC’s comparison of Trump's MSG rally to a Nazi gathering, even though, Musk pointed out, the rally included people of diverse backgrounds and religions.""They try to call the rally at Madison Square Garden like a Nazi rally. I'm like, yo, there was like literally an Israeli flag in the audience. I think like a quarter of the speakers were Jewish. Like there were people of every race, color, creed, religion at that rally,"" Musk said.","Elon Musk made a surprise appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. He accused the Democratic Party of hypocrisy and spreading misinformation. Musk also voiced concern over what he sees as the left's shift towards authoritarianism.

Judge allows Elon Musk’s $1 million-a-day sweepstakes amid accusations of election interference,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/judge-allows-elon-musks-1-million-a-day-sweepstakes-amid-accusations-of-election-interference/articleshow/114961497.cms,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk at a rally

A Pennsylvania court has ruled that a high-profile $1 million-a-day sweepstakes, hosted by Elon Musk's America PAC in key swing states, can continue through the presidential election. The decision by Judge Angelo Foglietta on Monday comes after Musk’s lawyers argued that recipients of the sweepstakes are not chosen at random but rather selected based on alignment with the PAC’s values. Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, however, had attempted to halt the programme, describing it as a ""scam"" that breaches state election laws.The sweepstakes, designed to register over a million voters in battleground states, offers substantial payouts to selected participants who sign a petition supporting the First and Second Amendments. Musk’s lawyer, Chris Gober, defended the programme, explaining that recipients were not randomly picked but pre-screened to ensure they represent the PAC’s ideals. Gober confirmed that two more recipients would be named before Election Day, one in Arizona and another in Michigan.In response, Krasner’s legal team argued that the initiative is a thinly veiled attempt to sway the election. Testifying in court, America PAC director Chris Young admitted that recipients undergo personality assessments to determine if they fit the PAC's messaging and sign nondisclosure agreements to keep details of their selection process confidential. In past social media posts, however, Musk indicated that anyone signing the petition had a “chance” to win the daily $1 million prize, which Krasner's team pointed out contradicts claims that winners were not randomly selected.The sweepstakes also caught the attention of the US Justice Department, which recently issued a warning to Musk’s PAC over potential violations of federal election laws, specifically those that prohibit financial incentives tied to voter registration. This caution, reportedly sent by the department’s Public Integrity Section, has prompted America PAC to revise its messaging. Under new guidelines, recipients are now referred to as “spokespersons” rather than “winners,” a change some experts suggest does little to alter the sweepstakes' structure.Legal experts are divided on the issue. Some argue the programme exists in a legal “grey area,” potentially sidestepping direct violation of voter laws, while others contend it skirts dangerously close to illegal compensation for voter participation. Matthew Sanderson, a Republican election law expert, stated that while the programme raises legal questions, it does not necessarily break the law.The sweepstakes has already seen four winners from states like Pennsylvania and Michigan, all of whom publicly endorsed Trump and constitutional rights in promotional videos. America PAC has pledged that all prize funds will be disbursed by the end of November, although it remains unclear whether the recipients have received their winnings. Meanwhile, concerns linger over the PAC's potential long-term use of voter data from over a million registrants, which Krasner suggests may exploit participants beyond the election season.Elon Musk, who did not attend the court hearing, has already poured more than $70 million into the PAC, backing Trump’s campaign and other Republican candidates ahead of the election. Krasner hinted he may pursue civil damages for Pennsylvania residents who signed up for the sweepstakes, suggesting that Musk's operation misuses electoral integrity and infringes on the state’s lottery laws.","A Pennsylvania court has ruled that a high-profile $1 million-a-day sweepstakes, hosted by Elon Musk's America PAC, can continue through the presidential election.

Kamala Harris: Ex-Obama Campaign Manager Calls Early Voting Data 'A Little Scary',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/early-voting-data-a-little-scary-for-kamala-harris-says-ex-obama-campaign-manager/articleshow/114955715.cms,"Early voting data is not good for Kamala Harris, ex-Obama campaign manager said.

The early vote numbers are a little scary for vice president Kamala Harris , Jim Messina, who ran the Obama campaign in 2012, told on MSNBC adding that several of his friends called him panicking as the early voting numbers indicate a surge in Republican vote turnout.“Republicans didn’t do what they did last time,” Messina continued. “Last time, Trump said don’t early vote so they didn’t. Republicans do have an advantage in early vote numbers. When the early votes come in, it’s going to look a little bit different than 2020 and that’s scary.”Messina said that Democrats are pleased with the early turnout of two voting demographics that the Harris camp has been banking on: women, and younger voters. ""Women voters make up 55 per cent of early voters, and in the past 10 days, young voters in these battleground states are coming out in what looks to be, for early voters, historic numbers.""Messina is not losing hope and said he thinks Harris is holding strong in the last leg of the campaign.“But when you look at some of the early vote numbers, it has led lots of your friends and my friends to call me panicking,” he continued. “And I do think it is true: The Republicans have done a better job than they did last time on early vote.”About 75 million people have cast ballots in the early voting period that was held in the last few weeks in many states. Projections from early voting indicate that the overall turnout for the election will probably be between the roughly 60 per cent of eligible voters who turned out in 2016 and the two-thirds of eligible voters who voted in 2020, according to Michael McDonald, a University of Florida professor.Figures collected by the University of Florida Election Lab's early voter tracker show that 42,664,880 people have voted early in person, while 35,376,421 mail-in ballots were returned as of the morning of Monday, November 4. This figure is nearly half the total 158.4 million votes cast in the 2020 election. The data suggests that Republicans are now more willing to cast their votes early than in previous elections, instead of waiting until Election Day. In past elections, Democrats favored early in-person and mail-in voting.","The early vote numbers are a little scary for vice president Kamala Harris, Jim Messina, who ran the Obama campaign in 2012, said.

ISLAMABAD: In a pivotal legislative move, the Pakistani government introduced a bill on Friday that seeks to authorise military and civil armed forces to detain individuals charged with terrorism for up to three months under a system of "" preventive detention .""This bill, which amends the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) of 1997, was tabled by law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar in a session of the National Assembly that saw limited attendance and was quickly referred to the relevant committee for further consideration, Dawn reported.The proposed legislation includes measures for forming Joint Investigation Teams (JITs) made up of various law enforcement and intelligence agency members to conduct inquiries into terrorism-related cases.These amendments to Clause 11EEEE of the ATA were initially enacted following the tragic Army Public School attack in Peshawar but lapsed a decade ago due to a sunset clause.As outlined in the bill's Statement of Objects and Reasons, the ""erstwhile amendments of Section 11EEEE of the Act are required to be re-inserted to empower the government, armed forces and civil armed forces with the necessary authority to detain individuals who pose a significant threat to national security.""The new provisions would allow preventive detention based on credible information or reasonable suspicion, enabling authorities to intervene before potential terrorist acts can be carried out, reported Dawn.Furthermore, the bill aims to strengthen the legal framework for law enforcement agencies to conduct more effective operations against terrorism. It will facilitate the formation of JITs to conduct thorough inquiries and gather actionable intelligence.According to the bill, Section 11EEEE was amended in 2014 to allow the government and authorised military and civil forces to detain individuals suspected of terrorism-related activities, but its validity expired in 2016 due to a sunset clause.The proposed amendment states: ""The government or, where the provisions of Section 4 have been invoked, the armed forces or civil armed forces, as the case may be, subject to the specific or general order of the government in this regard, for a period not exceeding three months and after recording reasons thereof, issue order for the preventive detention of any person who has been concerned in any offence under this Act relating to the security or defence of Pakistan or any part thereof, or public order relating to target killing, kidnapping for ransom, and extortion, bhatta or the maintenance of supplies or services, or against whom a reasonable complaint has been made or credible information has been received, or a reasonable suspicion exists of his having been so concerned, for purpose of inquiry.""Additionally, the amendment specifies that the detention of such persons, including any extensions beyond three months, will adhere to Article 10 of the Constitution. A new provision mandates that if an armed forces-issued detention order is made, the inquiry will involve a JIT, including a police officer of at least superintendent rank and members from various intelligence agencies.These new provisions will remain valid for two years following the commencement of the ATA (Amendment) Act, 2024.In related parliamentary discussions, speaker Ayaz Sadiq warned he would summon meetings of seven standing committees to elect chairpersons if the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party does not provide nominations by next week. The issue was raised after criticism of government ministers' absence during a question hour, Dawn reported.Law minister Tarar also addressed concerns regarding the placement of several opposition lawmakers on the Exit Control List (ECL), indicating that names are added due to absconding in criminal cases. He encouraged opposition members to formally submit requests for review, stating that 65 to 70 per cent of ECL removal requests are typically accepted.The National Assembly is scheduled to reconvene on Monday evening.","Pakistani government introduces bill to authorise military and civil armed forces to detain individuals charged with terrorism for up to three months.
