NEW DELHI: After two nursery students, four-year-old girls, were sexually abused by the sweeper of a reputed school in Thane district, protests erupted at Badlapur railway station on Tuesday where local trains were stopped and agitators blocked the tracks.Read more: Maharashtra Kids Sex Abuse Live Updates: CPRO Central Railway said, ""Local trains stopped at Badlapur railway station where protesters agitated against the alleged sexual assault incident with two minor girls at a school in Badlapur.""More than four hours have passed since the protesters descended on tracks but police and authorities are unable to convince protesters who refused to heed pleas for the withdrawal of the blockade.A call for Badlapur bandh has been given by several organisations to protest against the incident.Residents in Badlapur protested against the sexual abuse of two minor girls which occurred last week. Local train movement has been affected as protests are underway at Badlapur Station. Police have arrested a person in the case. The parents came to know about the incident on August 18 and filed anFIR .Two four-year-old nursery students were allegedly sexually abused by a newly hired sweeper at an English medium school in Thane district. The 24-year-old accused was arrested on Saturday, but the parents of the victims expressed their dissatisfaction with the police's handling of the case. They claimed that the FIR was registered more than 12 hours after the complaint was lodged, and only after the intervention of the District Women and Child Welfare Department.The school administration on Monday suspended the principal, class teacher , and female attendant, holding them responsible for the incident.The school administration has also come under scrutiny for allowing a male sweeper, who was hired on August 1, to accompany the young girls to the washroom. The incident came to light when one of the girls confided in her grandfather about the sexual abuse by the school staff member when he would take her and her friend to the washroom. The family then discussed the matter with the other girl's parents, who revealed that their daughter had recently become afraid to go to school.The families took the four-year-olds for a medical check-up with a private doctor, who confirmed that the girls had been sexually abused. They then approached a local MNS leader who accompanied them to the police station on Friday at 12.30 pm. However, instead of promptly recording the parents' statements and registering an FIR, the police station in-charge, Shubhada Shitole, allegedly made them wait for hours, stating that they needed to verify the claim first. Sources claimed that a police team visited the school but were informed that the CCTV cameras had not been functioning for the past few days.It was only after the District Women and Child Welfare Department intervened, police registered a case under the Pocso Act past midnight. On Saturday morning, police also got the girls’ medical examination conducted at a govt hospital as a private medical test is not valid in court.The police station incharge, Subhada Shitole, has been transferred to the special branch by Thane police for delaying the registration of the FIR when the parents of the child approached the police station.Locals said that along with citizens, rickshaw union, traders’ union, jewellers association, and now some political parties have also come forward to join the bandh. The accused, who was hired by the school on August 1, will remain in police remand until August 21.Rajya Sabha MP from UBT Sena, Priyanka Chaturvedi expressed her deep concern and condemned the incident.""Two young girls were sexually assaulted in Badlapur, Maharashtra in the school premises; the entire state is outraged and seeks justice. I once again urge the President to approve the Maharashtra Shakti Criminal Law, so that no other child or woman faces this travesty. Shame on the state government to continue to ignore the safety of women,"" she posted on X.Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray demanded a fast-track trial and speedy justice in the case of sexual abuse of two girls at a school in Thane district. Talking to reporters, Thackeray said on one hand, the Mahayuti government is running the Mukhyamantri Ladki Bahin scheme for women, but daughters of sisters are not safe.In an apparent reference to the rape and murder of a doctor in Kolkata, where the Mamata Banerjee-led government has come under fire, the Sena (UBT) chief said politics was being done over crime against women by targeting certain states.The former chief minister claimed the school where the girls were allegedly sexually abused was linked to BJP leaders. ""The case should be fast-tracked, and the victims should be ensured speedy justice,"" he said.Leaders of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) parties like Congress, Nationalist Congress Party (SP) and Shiv Sena (UBT), besides Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, attacked the government on the incident in the home district of chief minister Eknath Shinde.Nationalist Congress Party (SP) working president Supriya Sule said the incident is “very shocking and serious” and the state home department must take note of the citizens’ anger.“Citizens are demanding strict action against the murderer who committed this heinous act. The anger of the citizens is very right and the home department needs to take note of their anger,” urged Sule.She called upon the Thane Police to thoroughly investigate the (accused) person and take strict action against him.“Apart from this, a case should also be registered against the management of the institution who tried to suppress this matter,” demanded Sule.Congress leader of the opposition in the assembly, Vijay Wadettiwar called up Thane Police Commissioner Ashutosh Dumbare and demanded the suspension of the woman police official who reportedly made the victim’s parents sit in the police station for nearly 12 hours before taking their complaint last week.“This case must be taken up by a fast track court to hear it in three months and the accused must be given the death sentence,” said Wadettiwar.Congress MP and Mumbai president Varsha Gaikwad said, “The incident of inhumane and cruel treatment of the girls is mind-numbing”, and the issue of women’s safety has become very serious during the Shinde government, while its silence was unbearable.“The number of crimes against women is also increasing, but the state Home Minister and the government are not at all concerned. It is not enough to simply say 'Ladaki Baheen' and sit with rakhi in hand. If the government wants to preserve the true relationship with the sisters, it also has to fulfil the responsibility of keeping them safe as a true brother,” pointed out Gaikwad.SS (UBT)’s Deputy Leader Sushma Andhare questioned why schools without CCTVs and ‘sevikas’ (women assistants) were given permission and said “Ladki Bahin can wait, we need ‘Surakshit Bahin’ (secure sister) first”.Claiming that there is a complete collapse of law and order in the state, SS (UBT)’s spokesperson Kishore Tiwari demanded the immediate sacking of deputy CM Fadnavis and forming an SIT to probe the shocking case.“The law and order does not exist due to corruption and cash deals to get desired police postings… The CM is like a rubber stamp as there's a complete collapse of law and order due to hostile corruption and cash and getting the desired posting. The BJP is responsible for the present messy situation,” said Tiwari.Demanding the resignation of both the CM and deputy CM, VBA Chief Spokesperson Siddharth Mokle said the incident is a blot on humanity but the government is only obsessed about winning the next elections at all costs.The Maharashtra government on Tuesday ordered the setting up of a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the alleged sexual abuse of two girl students of a school in Badlapur. The SIT will be headed by Inspector General of Police-rank officer Aarti Singh, deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, who heads the home department, stated on X.Fadnavis stated he has directed the Thane Police Commissioner to prepare a proposal to try the case in a fast-track court.Maharashtra government ordered the suspension of three police officials, including a senior inspector, for alleged dereliction of duty in the investigation of the sexual abuse of two girls at a school in Badlapur, amid widespread protests.""The orders of immediate suspension of the senior police inspector, assistant sub-inspector and head constable attached to Badlapur police station for the dereliction of duty have been issued,"" deputy chief minister and home minister Devendra Fadnavis posted on X.Fadnavis said the state government has appointed Arti Singh, an inspector general-rank Indian Police Service (IPS) officer, to conduct the inquiry.""It will be our endeavour to inquire into the incident at the earliest. We want to file the chargesheet in this case as soon as possible and place the matter before a fast-track court for hearing,"" he said.""Our police department will make complete efforts to get such a barbaric and inhuman act punished immediately,"" the deputy chief minister added.He slammed the Nationalist Congress Party's (NCP) working president, Supriya Sule, and former Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray for allegedly politicising the issue.""It is unfortunate that the opposition seeks to gain political benefit out of such incidents. The opposition is devoid of any empathy. The politics of the opposition is coming to the fore,"" the senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader said.He said Thackeray should behave like a statesman and not stoop too low and indulge in politics on a sensitive issue of sexual abuse.Meanwhile, Maharashtra chief minister Eknath Shinde has directed the police to invoke the attempt to rape charge against the arrested accused. The case will be fast-tracked and a special public prosecutor will be appointed, Shinde said on Tuesday.""I have spoken to the Thane Commissioner of Police. The accused has been arrested. I have asked the case to be fast-tracked and book the accused under the charges of attempt to rape and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act,"" he said.The chief minister warned of legal action if the management of the school is found negligent or complicit, the chief minister's office (CMO) stated.During a meeting with education minister Deepak Kesarkar, Shinde proposed several measures aimed at improving school safety and preventing future abuse like the installation of complaint boxes in every school, enhancing scrutiny of school staff who frequently interact with students, including the background checks, and establishing safe reporting mechanisms for students.Shinde appealed to demonstrating parents to exercise restraint as the rail blockade was hampering the functioning of local trains.Maharashtra education minister Deepak Kesarkar said, ""We will see to it that the existing safety measures are further strengthened. We are issuing a circular today that CCTVs must be operational in each school. We will appoint a committee based on the Vishaka committee in schools as well. We will fast-track this case and give the strictest punishment to the accused. The school principal, the class teacher and 2 assistants have been suspended. The school also has been served a notice. A woman senior PI who delayed registering a case has been transferred but she should be suspended.""""This is a very sad incident. The entire machinery of the state education department has been mobilized. We have given instructions to four IAS officers from Pune and Mumbai. We are investigating why the CCTV was not functioning in the school. After the complaint was lodged, no action was taken, so the Senior PI has been transferred. We will bring this case to a Fast Track court and ensure the maximum punishment for the accused. Our entire department is present here, and the safety of students is our priority,"" he added.Meanwhile, a BJP MLA from the Murbad assembly constituency in Thane district, Kisan Kathore, alleged the protest at Badlapur railway station is politically motivated. He claimed agitators have come from neighbouring areas and not from Badlapur.""These demonstrators are not from Badlapur city; they have arrived from neighbouring areas such as Ulhasnagar. A comprehensive investigation is conducted against the school principal and staff members who allegedly attempted to suppress the incident,"" Kathore said.He alleged some individuals associated with political parties had put up banners in Badlapur rejecting the funds offered under the ""Mukhyamantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana"", but are now seeking justice. ""The protesters at Badlapur station are not locals. They are residents of neighbouring areas,"" he added.The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) on Tuesday demanded a detailed report from Maharashtra authorities on the incident of alleged sexual assault on two four-year-old girls in a school washroom in Thane district and the ""delay"" in filing an FIR in the matter. The Commission took suo motu cognisance of the case on a day thousands of protesters blocked railway tracks at Badlapur station in Thane and stormed the local school building, where the alleged incident had occurred.The accused, who was employed to clean the girls' toilets, is alleged to have victimised the children on August 12-13, 2024.The NHRC has issued notices to the chief secretary and the Director General of Police of Maharashtra, demanding a detailed report on the incident within two weeks.The Commission's directive calls for clarity on the reasons behind the reported ""12-hour delay"" in registering the First Information Report (FIR) after the parents lodged a complaint with the police.Parents of the victims have raised concerns over why a female staff member was not assigned to clean the girls' washroom, a standard practice that could have potentially prevented such an incident.The Commission has emphasised the need to investigate this aspect thoroughly.In addition to the status of the FIR, the NHRC has requested details about the health and well-being of the two victims, including whether they have received any counselling or support services from the authorities or the school management.The NHRC has also asked for information on the measures being taken or proposed to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future.The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) will dispatch a team to Thane in Maharashtra following the alleged sexual assault of a four-year-old girl in a school in the district. The apex child rights body has also questioned the delay in the registration of an FIR in the matter. The incident has sparked outrage, particularly due to a reported delay by the local police in lodging the First Information Report (FIR).NCPCR Chairperson Priyank Kanoongo took to social media to express his distress over the incident and announced that a team would be dispatched to investigate the matter.He questioned why police made the victim's parents wait for 12 hours to get an FIR lodged.""I will personally monitor the investigation, and ensure that all negligent police officers are punished,"" Kanoongo said in a post on X.A woman journalist covering the protest over the Badlapur sexual abuse incident alleged on Tuesday that a local leader of the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena made an offensive remark, saying she was acting 'as if she herself had been raped.'Waman Mhatre, former mayor of Badlapur who belongs to the party led by the Maharashtra chief minister, however, claimed that his remark was misconstrued.The woman journalist, who works for a Marathi daily, told a news channel that as she was covering the protests on the tracks, Mhatre confronted her, making 'vulgar' gestures. She was reporting on the incident in such a way 'as if she herself had been raped,' she quoted Mhatre as saying.""Such behavior was highly unacceptable and caused me agony. However, I responded by asserting that my reporting is based on facts,"" the woman added.Mhatre claimed that his comments were misconstrued. ""I was insisting that they provide factual information to the protesters. The word 'rape' was consistently used. I was asking them to get factual information, but it was misconstrued,"" he said.The Mumbai Press Club condemned Mhatre's statements and demanded that chief minister Shinde take action against him. Mhatre ""demonstrated blatant disregard for public sentiment by blaming journalists for the incident"" and asserted that the media was inciting unrest, the Press Club said in a statement.","Two four-year-old nursery students were allegedly sexually abused by a newly hired sweeper at an English medium school in Thane district. Parents of the victims expressed their dissatisfaction with the police's handling of the case. Local train movement has been affected as protests are underway at Badlapur Station.

What is Hezbollah in Lebanon: Catalyst for Middle East war or path to peace?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/what-is-hezbollah-in-lebanon-catalyst-for-middle-east-war-or-path-to-peace/articleshow/112790988.cms,"A rapid cycle of retaliation

What is Hezbollah?

Hezbollah’s leadership and military power

Recent escalations and Israeli response

The potential for regional impact

The escalating conflict between Hezbollah and Israel has captured global attention as the risk of a wider Middle East war looms. For weeks, Israelis have been on edge, anticipating a major attack by Hezbollah in retaliation for Israel's assassination of a senior Hezbollah commander, Fuad Shukur, in Beirut last month.For now, the recent strikes might serve to ease tensions temporarily, but the underlying conflict remains unresolved, with the potential to reignite at any moment.This heightened tension has sparked widespread fears that a cross-border escalation could spiral into an all-out regional war.Much of Israel woke up on Sunday to find that, at least for the immediate term, the feared attack seemed to be over almost before it began. Both Israel and Hezbollah quickly claimed victories of sorts. Israel boasted of its predawn preemptive strikes against thousands of Hezbollah's rocket launchers in southern Lebanon, while Hezbollah touted its subsequent rocket and drone barrages targeting northern Israel, which the Israeli military said resulted in the death of a naval officer.By breakfast time, both sides were already employing the language of containment. Hezbollah announced that it had completed the ""first stage"" of its retaliation for Shukur's assassination and seemed to be signaling a pause, at least for now. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant emphasized the importance of avoiding further regional escalation during his conversation with US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.Hezbollah, a Shia Muslim organization, is a politically influential entity in Lebanon and controls the country’s most powerful armed force. Established in the early 1980s with support from Iran, Hezbollah was formed to counter Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon during the Lebanese civil war. Over the decades, it has grown into a major political and military force in Lebanon, participating in national elections since 1992 and maintaining a strong presence in the country’s politics.Hezbollah's armed wing has a history of carrying out deadly attacks against Israeli and US forces in Lebanon. The group claims credit for Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000, portraying itself as a formidable resistance force. Hezbollah has since maintained thousands of fighters and amassed a vast missile arsenal in southern Lebanon, continuing its opposition to Israel’s presence in disputed border areas, as reported by BBC.Led by Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah since 1992, Hezbollah has been deeply intertwined with Iran, receiving funding and military support. Nasrallah, revered within Hezbollah, has become a central figure in the group's rise to power. Under his leadership, Hezbollah's military capabilities have expanded significantly. While Nasrallah claims the group has 100,000 fighters, independent estimates suggest a number between 20,000 and 50,000, many of whom are battle-hardened from the Syrian civil war, reported BBC.Hezbollah’s military strength is unparalleled among non-state actors, with an estimated 120,000-200,000 rockets and missiles, including advanced guided missiles capable of striking deep inside Israel. This arsenal positions Hezbollah as a significant threat in the region, with capabilities far exceeding those of groups like Hamas in Gaza.Tensions between Hezbollah and Israel escalated dramatically on Sunday, as both sides traded heavy aerial attacks. Hezbollah launched a barrage of rockets in retaliation for the assassination of senior Hezbollah figure Fuad Shukr, who was killed on July 30. Hezbollah claimed to have fired 340 Katyusha rockets at Israel, though US officials reported a lower number. Israel responded with a massive airstrike, deploying over 100 jets to target Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Hezbollah and Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei that Israel’s actions were aimed at altering the balance of power along the Israeli-Lebanese border. “Israel is hitting Hezbollah with surprising, crushing blows,” Netanyahu stated, emphasizing that Israel's response was part of a broader strategy to secure its northern border.Despite the intensity of the recent exchanges, both Hezbollah and Israel have signaled that they do not seek a full-scale war in Lebanon. Some experts believe that these measured responses could lead to a temporary de-escalation of tensions, reducing the immediate risk of a broader conflict. Former Israeli Intelligence official Avi Melamed noted that the calibrated nature of Hezbollah’s retaliation indicates a desire to avoid triggering a larger war.However, the situation remains volatile, with global concerns that the conflict could spill over into neighboring regions. The ongoing violence also complicates efforts to reach a ceasefire in Gaza, as negotiators in Cairo struggle to broker a truce between Israel and Hamas.","Tensions between Hezbollah and Israel escalated dramatically on Sunday, as both sides traded heavy aerial attacks.

He revealed that the main target was a military intelligence base located about 110 km (70 miles) inside Israeli territory.

Durov’s background and the future of Telegram

French-Russian tech tycoon Pavel Durov was taken into custody at a Paris airport on Sunday for suspected involvement in activities associated with his messaging app Telegram. The alleged offences include fraud, drug trafficking, cyberbullying, organised crime and the promotion of terrorism.As per the Moscow Times, Durov was detained at Le Bourget Airport and is scheduled to appear in court on Sunday itself.He could face charges that carry a maximum prison term of 20 years. The arrest has sparked significant discussion and responses within the technology sector and among well-known individuals.France has authorised the arrest of Durov as a part of an initial inquiry into the purported offences. The detention of the founder of Telegram has sparked further debates regarding the platform's policies on regulating content.Renowned for its end-to-end encryption , Telegram permits groups of up to 200,000 members, consequently raising allegations that it enables the proliferation of inaccurate information and detrimental content.The reaction from the tech industry to Durov’s arrest has been swift and vocal. Elon Musk , the founder of SpaceX, was one of the first prominent tech figures to support the “#FreePavel” trend. He expressed concern about the arrest, seeing it as an attack on free speech and suggested wider implications for censorship. Musk highlighted the dangerous direction these actions represent and expressed increased worry about censorship.American entrepreneur Balaji Srinivasan also criticised the French government's actions. He suggested that the motives behind the arrest were more about control than actual crime prevention, pointing out the impracticality of holding Durov accountable for user actions on Telegram when the French government itself struggles with domestic crime.Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin voiced apprehensions, noting that while he has previously criticised Telegram's encryption policies, the arrest of Durov raises troubling implications for communication freedom in Europe.Paul Graham, a noted computer scientist and writer, weighed in on the issue, discussing how Durov's arrest could impact France's reputation as a hub for startups. He highlighted the potential negative ramifications for the country’s business environment.Edward Snowden , former NSA intelligence contractor and whistleblower, condemned the arrest on social media. Expressing his dismay on X (formerly Twitter), Snowden stated, “an assault on the basic human rights of speech and association,” adding that it tarnishes France's global reputation.According to the Moscow Times, Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host who interviewed Durov earlier this year, made a pointed comparison. “Pavel Durov left Russia when the government tried to control his social media company, Telegram. But in the end, it wasn’t Putin who arrested him for allowing the public to exercise free speech. It was a western country, a Biden administration ally and enthusiastic NATO member, that locked him away,” said Carlson.The Russian Foreign Ministry responded quickly to Durov's detention. “In response to the information about Durov's detention, the Russian Embassy in France immediately took the necessary steps to clarify the situation regarding the Russian citizen, despite the absence of any request from the businessman's [Durov’s] representatives,” the ministry told the state-run TASS news agency.As yet, Telegram has not released an official statement regarding Durov's arrest. Meanwhile, the Russian embassy in France is reportedly working to address the situation, underscoring the diplomatic attention the arrest has garnered.Durov, who now resides in Dubai, holds dual citizenship in France and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). He left Russia in 2014 amid government pressure to shut down opposition groups on his VKontakte social media platform. Ranked as the 120th richest person in the world as of August 25, Durov’s swift arrest upon his arrival in France has become a flashpoint for larger debates about free speech, law enforcement, and digital privacy.Telegram, launched by Durov in 2013, is renowned for its secure, end-to-end encrypted messaging services. The platform allows users to create channels to disseminate information rapidly to large audiences, contributing to its widespread international use.The upcoming court appearance will determine the next steps in this unfolding legal drama.","French-Russian tech tycoon Pavel Durov was taken into custody at a Paris airport on Sunday for suspected involvement in activities associated with his messaging app Telegram.

Warren's comments came during an interview on NBC’s Meet the Press, where she challenged Vance’s claims about Trump’s stance on abortion rights.“American women are not stupid,” Warren said, expressing skepticism about Vance's claims.“We’re not going to trust the futures of our daughters and granddaughters to two men who have openly bragged about blocking access to abortion.”Vance, the GOP vice-presidential nominee, had earlier suggested that Trump would reject a nationwide abortion ban, arguing that the former president prefers to leave abortion regulation to individual states. “I think he would,” Vance said when asked if Trump would veto a federal ban . “He’s said that explicitly that he would.”Warren dismissed Vance’s statements, arguing that even if Trump did not sign a federal ban, his administration would still restrict abortion rights. She highlighted the Comstock Act, a historic law banning the mailing of abortion-related materials, which some Republicans have suggested reviving to impose nationwide restrictions. “Don’t buy it? Just read it,” Warren advised. “JD Vance actually sent a letter last year to the Department of Justice saying, enforce the Comstock Act. And remember he did that, and then Donald Trump picked him to be his vice president.”Trump has recently reiterated his belief that abortion rights and restrictions should be determined by individual states. However, he has often praised his Supreme Court appointees who played a key role in overturning Roe v. Wade. Vance has previously indicated openness to a national abortion ban.In her interview, Warren urged voters to support candidates who will work to restore abortion rights nationwide. “The only way that we’re going to protect access to abortion is to have a Democratic Congress send a bill to Kamala Harris, she will sign it into law, and then we will restore a right to half the population in this country,” Warren said. “No longer will a woman have to go into an emergency room and be told she’s not near enough death to get the medical treatment that she needs.”","Sen.

Trump has recently reiterated his belief that abortion rights and restrictions should be determined by individual states.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112791754,imgsize-1745467,width-400,resizemode-4/112791754.jpg"
Democracy on line? Swing state Wisconsin offers a test,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/democracy-on-line-swing-state-wisconsin-offers-a-test/articleshow/112791499.cms,"APPLETON : Michael Hovde has a lot he dislikes about Donald Trump 's agenda. But when he votes in November in the electorally crucial state of Wisconsin , he believes the stakes are far higher than mere policy issues.""Trump, I think, is an existential threat to democracy ,"" the 36-year-old said as he strolled through the bustling downtown of Appleton, one of the most politically diverse areas of one of the most closely divided US states.He pointed to the ""terrifying"" people around the Republican mogul and to Project 2025, the governing blueprint written for, but publicly disavowed by, Trump that would ram through his hard-right policies.""They aim to truly just bypass and circumvent checks and balances, and really neuter the efficacy of our political system,"" Hovde said.Not far away, past the verdant lawns and elegant Victorian homes in this comfortably middle-class city, Casey Stern, 58, sees the race between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris quite differently.Above his neatly tended garden of corn and zucchini flies an imposing ""Trump 2024"" flag. Another banner calls for Biden 's impeachment and says, ""We the People Are Pissed.""If the message is in-your-face, so are the reactions. Stern recounts passers-by shouting profanities, while some critics jot down his address and send him letters.He acknowledged that Trump's ""mean tweets in the middle of the night"" can bother people but believes the country needs a ""strong-willed"" leader to address inflation, immigration and crime.""Every time you go to the grocery store, you can't even afford a steak,"" Stern said.He scoffed at Democrats' charges that Trump puts democracy at risk, accusing President Joe Biden of stifling public debate over the Covid-19 pandemic.""Biden has done more to harm democracy,"" he said.- State of tumult -If there is one state where the Democrats' message on Trump's threat to democracy may mobilize voters, it is Wisconsin.Once known for clean, polite, left-tilting politics, Wisconsin has become an epicenter of partisanship -- an ultimate swing state that could tip the national .Trump stunned complacent Democrats by winning narrowly in 2016. Biden then took back Wisconsin by another razor-thin margin in 2020.A turning point had come in 2010 when Scott Walker, a young Republican who many presumed would respect Wisconsin's mild-mannered political style, was elected governor and unleashed sweeping changes.He stripped power from Wisconsin's once-formidable labor unions, and his Republicans drastically redrew election maps, virtually guaranteeing party control of the state legislature.Democrats hope Republicans will have their comeuppance in the November 5 election, fought on less partisan maps after a ruling by the state Supreme Court's new liberal majority.Kristin Alfheim, a Democrat who is seeking a state Senate seat, said competitive maps benefit democracy.""It brings the opportunity for accountability from both sides, knowing they're going to need to work together,"" she said.- 'Democracy' cuts both ways -Biden and Harris have hammered away on the threat to democracy from Trump, who refused to accept defeat in 2020 and fired up the supporters who attacked the Capitol on January 6, 2021.Arnold Shober, a government professor at Lawrence University in Appleton, said the democracy theme carried ""special resonance"" in Wisconsin after its experience with Walker, who was voted out in 2018.But Shober said it cut both ways, with some Republicans still smarting over the boisterous, albeit nonviolent, protests that disrupted the state's capitol when Walker pushed through his anti-union measure, known as Act 10.""When you talk about January 6 in Wisconsin, folks on the right will instantly say, well, what about those Democrats with Act 10?"" Shober said.""They see it almost as an equity issue. You did it -- we can do it, too.""- Countering vitriol -The historic home to giant paper mills and now the base for major white-collar employers, Outagamie County, of which Appleton is the seat, was dominated by Republicans and produced the notorious anti-communist witch-hunter Joe McCarthy.But in a microcosm of the country, an urban-rural split has deepened, with Democrats gaining in an increasingly cosmopolitan Appleton.Outagamie County Chief Executive Tom Nelson, a Democrat sympathetic to socialist Bernie Sanders, has kept winning since 2011 even as he has seen coarseness in politics rising with Trump.""He has animated that vitriol, that contempt, that hatred,"" he said.Nelson said he has successfully reached across the divide on a more basic message.Fundamentally, he said, people want ""to be able to live in a community that is safe, that is healthy, that has a strong and vibrant economy.""","Wisconsin is an epicenter of partisanship -- an ultimate swing state that could tip the national election. Once known for clean, polite, left-tilting politics, Wisconsin has become a battleground state. Democrats hope Republicans will have their comeuppance in the November 5 election.

Kamala faces a Kennedy wrinkle on road to Kamalot,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-faces-a-kennedy-wrinkle-on-road-to-kamalot/articleshow/112762598.cms,"WASHINGTON: The ardor of a rousing convention in Chicago that Democrats hoped would accelerate momentum for Kamala Harris was impeded to a degree on Friday when independent candidate Robert Kennedy Jr , scion of the famous political dynasty, suspended his campaign for the White House and threw his support behind Donald Trump .Regarded as a third party insurgent who attracted voters disgruntled with both Biden and Trump early in the race, the nearly 15 per cent support for Kennedy at his peak moment had dropped to 5 per cent and was plunging after Kamala Harris became the Democrat nominee.The jury and pollsters are still out on whether he can take his remaining supporters to Trump or whether they will filter into the Kamala bandwagon.There's not enough solid data yet but one poll shows Harris' lead against Trump dropped only marginally by 0.2 per cent (down from 3.3 to 3.1 when Kennedy was taken out of the equation). However the Trump camp believes even a marginal shift in closely-fought battleground state could win them the election.Seen as betraying his political legacy by Democrats and his own siblings, Kennedy literally walked over to the Trump camp, joining the former President at a rally in Arizona on Friday evening just hours after he bailed out of the race. Trump, who with his customary flourish had previously called him a ""radical left"" candidate, opportunistically reversed course and welcomed him, saying he was a well respected candidate who raised important issues during his campaign.Kennedy, 70, is the nephew of President John F. Kennedy and the son of his brother, former attorney general and US senator Robert Kennedy, both of whom were assassinated in the 1960s. He caught the attention of voters with his anti-vaccine crusade in the covid years after years of work as an environmental activist and litigator. Almost all his siblings and cousins are aligned with the Democratic Party and some even spoke at the DNC in Chicago, endorsing Kamala Harris, earlier this week.Kennedy though had expressed various other frustrations with the Democratic Party after being thwarted in his bid for the party nomination, and gradually drifted towards Trump, even having secret conversations with him which were leaked. His campaign started falling apart after a series of bizarre statements he made, including admitting to leaving a dead bear in Central Park and claiming that a worm ate part of his brain.Shortly before walking over to the MAGA camp , he attempted to negotiate a cabinet position in a prospective Harris White House but was rebuffed. Trump on the other hand has indicated he is open to the idea.The Harris camp appears unconcerned by the development, seeing the new alliance as a sign of Trump's weakness and desperation after polls showed him sliding against Kamala after leading against Biden.","Kennedy, 70, is the nephew of President John F.

As Harris formally accepted the Democratic presidential nomination, Trump accused her of 'lying' and shared his live reactions on X through his Truth Social account.In anticipation of her address, Trump clearly expressed his intent to denounce Harris by posting on Truth Social, ""I'm getting ready to be fair but critical of Comrade Kamala Harris.My Play by Play will be on TRUTH Social, starting SOON!""As Harris began her speech, Trump wasted no time taking to social media to share his thoughts. He blasted her opening remarks, posting, ""Too many 'Thank yous,' too rapidly said, what's going on with her?""Trump went on tweeting spree on the vice president, focusing on her early remarks about her childhood and career aspirations. He urged her to address other pressing issues, writing, ""A lot of talk about childhood, we've got to get to the Border, Inflation, and Crime!""As Harris made a forceful defence of Ukraine and Nato in her speech, she attacked Trump’s past comments on the war in Ukraine.“As President, I will stand strong with Ukraine and our Nato allies,” Harris declared, highlighting her commitment to international alliances.She also said that five days before Russia invaded Ukraine, she warned President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and helped lead the US diplomatic response, rallying “more than 50 countries” to support Ukraine.In response, Trump defended his record on Nato, tweeting, ""Nato wasn’t paying their Bills, almost every Country was delinquent. When I said, 'If you don’t pay, we’re out, the United States is tired of being a sucker,' the money came rolling in by the BILLIONS, and I saved Nato!""Trump also seized the moment to criticise Harris on domestic issues, particularly immigration. As Harris also addressed about reforming America's broken immigration system in her speech at DNC.He accused her of wanting to grant citizenship to all undocumented immigrants. ""She just called to give all Illegals CITIZENSHIP, SAY GOODBYE TO THE USA! SHE IS A RADICAL MARXIST!"" Trump tweeted.Continuing his social media onslaught, Republican nominee posted, ""She talked about the Rule of Law but, as Border Czar, she allowed 20 Million people into our Country, many of them Criminals, who are MAIMING and KILLING our people!""Trump, with other top Republicans, has frequently labelled Harris a failed ""border czar"" in attacks on social media and during rally speeches, despite the fact that she never officially held this title. In March 2021, President Biden tasked Harris with addressing the ""root causes"" of migration to the US, a role distinct from direct oversight of border enforcement.Kamala Harris also highlighted Trump's past praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during her speech, asserting, “I will not cozy up to tyrants and dictators.”In reaction, Trump tweeted, ""The Tyrants are laughing at her; she’s weak and ineffective. For three and a half years, she has done nothing but enable them to become STRONG, RICH, and POWERFUL!""He further criticised Harris, stating, ""There will be no future under Comrade Kamala Harris because she will lead us into Nuclear World War III! She will never earn the respect of the Tyrants of the World!""Harris on the final night of DNC said that she would “always stand up for Israel’s right to defend itself,” while also pressing for the release of hostages and a cease-fire deal.She also acknowledged the dire situation in Gaza, saying, “At the same time, what has happened in Gaza in the last 10 months is devastating, so many innocent lives lost. Desperate, hungry people fleeing to safety over and over again. The scale of suffering is heartbreaking.”On her statement, Trump criticised Harris's statements on Israel, posting, ""SHE HATES ISRAEL - Wouldn’t even show up to Congress for Netanyahu’s session!"" He also made inflammatory claims, asserting, ""She caused the Attack of October 7th. Iran was BROKE - Didn’t have money for Hezbollah!""Harris took the center stage to officially accept her nomination, nearly a month after she entered the race following President Joe Biden's decision to withdraw.","Former US President and Republican nominee Donald Trump reacted strongly to Kamala Harris's speech during the final night of the Democratic National Convention.

In 2024, the world continues to grapple with severe conflicts, political instability, and humanitarian crises, making certain regions extremely dangerous. Countries like Yemen, Afghanistan, and Sudan remain at the forefront of global concern due to ongoing conflicts that have devastated their populations and infrastructure.To explore and understand which countries face the highest levels of danger, we turn to the Global Peace Index (GPI) compiled by the Institute for Economics and Peace.The Global Peace Index (GPI) provides a critical measure of the safety and stability of nations, highlighting those most impacted by war, violence, and unrest.This non-profit organization annually evaluates 163 countries across 23 indicators, including internal conflicts, societal safety, and levels of militarization, providing a comprehensive assessment of global peace and security. Here’s the list of the most dangerous countries in the world.With a 2024 GPI score of 3.397, Yemen continues to be one of the world's most dangerous countries. Since the onset of civil conflict in 2015, the nation has been plunged into chaos, with widespread famine, disease, and infrastructure collapse exacerbating the situation.The conflict, which started as an internal struggle, has been prolonged and intensified by the involvement of neighbouring countries, each backing different factions. This has only deepened the suffering of the Yemeni people, who face unimaginable hardships daily.Sudan remains one of the most dangerous countries globally, primarily due to ongoing conflicts in regions like Darfur, South Kordofan, and Blue Nile. In 2024, these conflicts resulted in over 3,000 deaths and displaced nearly 2 million people.The humanitarian crisis is severe, with frequent attacks on civilians by government forces, opposition groups, and militias. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), approximately 14 million people in Sudan are in dire need of humanitarian aid.South Sudan, with a GPI score of 3.324, remains one of the world's most perilous countries due to ongoing civil conflict, ethnic violence, and political instability. Since gaining independence in 2011, the country has struggled to maintain peace and stability, with its citizens facing continuous threats from internal strife and external pressures.Afghanistan, with a 2024 GPI score of 3.294, continues to be one of the most dangerous countries worldwide. Decades of conflict, compounded by the Taliban's seizure of power in 2021, have left the nation in a state of constant instability.The risks of terrorism, kidnappings, and widespread violence remain high, making Afghanistan a focal point of international concern.Ukraine has witnessed a significant decline in safety and stability, particularly since the Russian invasion began in February 2022. By 2024, the conflict has claimed over 150,000 lives, with millions more displaced both internally and externally.The destruction of cities and critical infrastructure, including homes, schools, and hospitals, has created a humanitarian crisis of immense proportions.The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) continues to suffer from one of the deadliest conflicts in African history. The ongoing violence, which has spanned more than four and a half years, has resulted in more lives lost than any other conflict since World War II, according to the International Rescue Committee. The DRC remains a highly dangerous place, with widespread violence and instability threatening the lives of millions.In 2024, Russia's GPI score of 3.249 reflects the nation's increasing danger, exacerbated by the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. Internally, Russia faces significant challenges, including organized crime and corruption, which undermine law and order.Additionally, environmental concerns, such as industrial accidents and pollution, pose substantial health risks to the population.Since the onset of its civil war in 2011, Syria has been one of the world's most dangerous countries. The conflict has devastated infrastructure, leaving buildings, roads, hospitals, and schools in ruins.The humanitarian situation is dire, with over 13 million Syrians in need of assistance, including 6.6 million internally displaced. Food insecurity is rampant, and the healthcare system is in disarray, with many hospitals destroyed or operating at minimal capacity.Mali has been embroiled in armed conflict since January 2012, when Tuareg rebels seized control of the northern territory, declaring the independent nation of Azawad by April of that year. The situation escalated further with a military coup in March 2012, deepening the turmoil in the region. Today, Mali remains one of the most dangerous countries, with ongoing violence and instability threatening the safety of its citizens","The Global Peace Index (GPI) provides a critical measure of the safety and stability of nations.

Campaign adjustments

Military service controversies

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz is embroiled in controversy as recent revelations challenge his past claims about his achievements and military career. The spotlight on Walz intensified with the resurfacing of a 2006 letter from the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce , casting doubt on his claims of accolades and military rank . As Walz navigates these accusations , his vice-presidential campaign faces mounting scrutiny and attempts at clarification.The controversy erupted when a 2006 letter from Barry L Kennedy, then-president of the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce, resurfaced. The letter, addressed to Walz, refutes his earlier assertion that he received an award from the Chamber in 1993. During his initial Congressional campaign, Walz’s website claimed recognition from the Nebraska Chamber for his contributions to the business sector, as reported by the Post Bulletin in 2006.Kennedy's letter explicitly states, “We researched this matter and can confirm that you have not been the recipient of any award from the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce.” He further requested the removal of any reference to the Chamber to avoid implications of endorsement. Kennedy also highlighted that the US Chamber of Commerce had endorsed Walz’s opponent, Congressman Gil Gutknecht, for his support of small business issues.In response to the resurfaced letter, Walz’s campaign promptly updated his website, clarifying that the award in question was from the Nebraska Junior Chamber of Commerce, known as the Jaycees. The campaign labeled the initial reference as a “typographical error,” according to the Post Bulletin.When approached for comment, the Harris-Walz campaign defended Walz’s record, attributing his misstatements to his informal speaking style. “Governor Walz speaks the way real people speak, openly and off the cuff. The American people appreciate that Gov Walz tells it like it is and doesn’t talk like a politician,” the campaign stated. They emphasized the distinction between occasional misspeaking and deliberate falsehoods, contrasting Walz’s approach with that of Donald Trump.The scrutiny surrounding Walz extends beyond the business award . Allegations have surfaced regarding his military service, with critics accusing him of misrepresenting his rank. Walz, a retired Army National Guard member, has faced accusations of falsely claiming a higher rank than he held at retirement. Despite being promoted to Command Sergeant Major during a 2004 deployment, Walz did not complete the requisite coursework at the US Army Sergeants Major Academy to retain that rank upon retirement. Instead, he retired as a Master Sergeant, one rank lower.Retired Navy captain and Republican Virginia Senate candidate Hung Cao criticized Walz, asserting, “For 20 years, they let this guy go by with a lie that he deployed to Iraq, which he didn’t, and that he retired as a command sergeant major, which he did not. I mean, that’s just blatant lies.” Additionally, Walz’s former battalion commander in the Minnesota Army National Guard condemned him for misleading the public about his military title.","Minnesota Governor Tim Walz is embroiled in controversy as recent revelations challenge his past claims about his achievements and military career. A 2006 letter from the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce refutes his earlier assertion that he received an award from the Chamber in 1993. Allegations have surfaced regarding his military service, with critics accusing him of misrepresenting his rank.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112791301,imgsize-727347,width-400,resizemode-4/112791301.jpg"

The former president's remarks came just hours after Israel conducted a series of preemptive airstrikes against Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon, significantly escalating tensions in the region.Taking to Truth Social, Trump questioned the Biden administration 's handling of the situation in the Middle East , criticizing both President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. ""Who is negotiating for us in the Middle East? Bombs are dropping all over the place!"" Trump posted. He then lashed out at Biden, saying, ""Sleepy Joe is sleeping on a beach in California, viciously exiled by the Democrats, and Comrade Kamala is doing a campaign bus tour with Tampon Tim, her really bad VP pick. Let's not have World War III because that's where we're heading!""The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) stated that their strikes were a defensive measure aimed at preventing Hezbollah from launching rockets and missiles at Tel Aviv. ""We have neutralized thousands of rocket launchers at over 40 sites,"" IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari announced. In retaliation, Hezbollah fired hundreds of Katyusha rockets and drones, further intensifying the conflict.Hezbollah dismissed Israel's allegations as ""baseless"" and launched counterattacks, which it described as the ""first phase"" of its response. Hezbollah hailed its strikes as a ""complete success,"" according to a report by CNN.Trump's warnings of a looming global conflict are not new. Just days earlier, he declared, ""There will be no future under Comrade Kamala Harris, because she will take us into a Nuclear World War III!""

The IDF emphasized their commitment to defending their civilians and the State of Israel, stating on X, ""We will do whatever is needed to defend our civilians and the State of Israel.""As the situation deteriorates, Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant declared a state of emergency for the next 48 hours, allowing the IDF Home Front Command to issue restrictions and take necessary actions to protect the civilian population.In a press conference, IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari warned Lebanese citizens in southern Lebanon of imminent Israeli attacks. ""We warn the Lebanese citizens who are in southern Lebanon; we recognize that Hezbollah is now preparing to shoot widely into Israeli territory near your home. You are in danger. We attack and remove Hezbollah threats. Anyone who is near the areas where Hezbollah operates is required to stay away from them immediately,"" Hagari stated.With tensions at a boiling point, the Israeli public remains on high alert, bracing for further escalation as both sides continue to exchange heavy fire. The IDF has urged civilians to follow ""life-saving"" instructions from the Home Front Command, which will be updated regularly based on the evolving situation.",Donald Trump has warned that the United States is on the verge of World War III.

The incident, which occurred just ten minutes into Harris’s speech, shocked attendees and temporarily disrupted the event.The interruption took place when a tall man, clad in black and displaying a press badge, stormed the stage.Identified later as Aidan Cook , the protester seized the microphone from Harris’s hand while she was discussing the gender pay gap, a topic central to her campaign.Cook, who appeared visibly agitated, used the microphone to express his own concerns. “I’m asking for your attention for a much bigger idea than…” he began before being swiftly cut off by event staff. The situation escalated quickly as security personnel and Harris’s husband, Douglas Emhoff, moved to remove Cook from the stage.Despite the disruption, Harris maintained her composure and stepped off the stage briefly as security addressed the situation.After Cook was escorted from the venue, Harris returned to the stage to reassure the crowd. With calm and poise, she addressed her supporters, saying, “It’s all good. It’s all good. Don’t worry.” She then turned to the event’s moderator to continue with her scheduled speech.The protester, who was not charged, later spoke with Politico, explaining his motivations. “I live in Oakland and I’m one of Kamala Harris’ constituents,” Cook said. “I came to the MoveOn Big Ideas Forum today because there’s one big idea that all of the 2020 presidential candidates are ignoring. By raising and slaughtering billions of animals every year, we are not only undermining our values as a nation of compassionate animal lovers, but we are also contributing to climate change, which is a critical issue.”","A protester snatched the microphone from Presidential hopeful Kamala Harris.

Vance claimed that Trump believes such a ban would exacerbate federal conflict, preferring instead to leave abortion decisions to individual states and their distinct cultural and political contexts.“I can absolutely commit that,” Vance said on NBC's “Meet the Press” whether he could commit that Trump would not impose such a ban.""Donald Trump’s view is that we want the individual states and their individual cultures and their unique political sensibilities to make these decisions because we don’t want to have a nonstop federal conflict over this issue"", he added.“I mean, if you’re not supporting it as the president of the United States, you fundamentally have to veto it,""Vance’s comments come in the wake of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, where Trump faced sharp criticism for his role in appointing the Supreme Court Justices who overturned Roe v Wade . This landmark decision ended the constitutional right to abortion in the United States, and Democrats have been vocal about the implications of this shift.During the convention, speakers lashed out at Trump, accusing him of undermining women's reproductive rights. Trump, however, has recently pushed back against these accusations. He has reassured voters that his administration would be ""great for women and their reproductive rights,"" a statement that had been met with skepticism.Anti-abortion advocates have expressed concern over Trump’s apparent ambiguity on the issue. The editor of the conservative National Review has publicly criticised Trump, questioning his commitment to the anti-abortion cause.Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren denounced Trump and Vance’s stance, arguing that trusting Trump and his running mate with reproductive rights is unwise given their track record.Trump’s position on abortion has been notably inconsistent. Before entering politics, he identified as ""very pro-choice,"" but his views have evolved over time. Earlier this year, Trump seemed to waver on whether to support a federal abortion ban but ultimately aligned with the notion that such matters should be determined by states.In a recent CBS News interview, Trump maintained he had ""no regrets"" about the Roe v Wade reversal but clarified that he would not use the Comstock Act to ban medication used in alternative abortions.Abortion remains a central issue for Democrats, particularly since the Roe v Wade decision in 2022. The party is banking on the topic to energize their base for the upcoming election. Vice President Kamala Harris, in her nomination acceptance speech, warned that Trump’s actions have had dire consequences for women, citing numerous personal stories of women denied essential medical care.","Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance said that former President Donald Trump, if re-elected, would not support a national abortion ban.
