Carignan's military career

Canada's top military official, General Jennie Carignan , on Saturday called out US Senator Jim Risch 's comments about the role of women in combat during a panel at the Halifax International Security Forum in Nova Scotia. She expressed concerns about the need to justify the ""contribution of women to defense and service in their countries.""During the same forum on Friday, Risch, the ranking member of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee , was asked whether Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump 's nominee for defense secretary, should retract his remarks suggesting that men and women should not serve together in combat units. In response, Risch said, ""I think it's delusional for anybody to not agree that women in combat create certain unique situations that have to be dealt with. I think the jury's still out on how to do that.""Addressing Risch 's statement the next day, Carignan , the first woman to lead the Canadian Armed Forces , firmly countered his comments. ""If you'll allow me, I would first like to respond to Senator Risch's statement yesterday about women in combat because I wouldn't want anyone to leave this forum with the idea that women are a distraction to defense and national security,"" she said.Carignan, a 39-year veteran with extensive combat experience, emphasized the invaluable contributions of women in defense. ""After 39 years of service as a combat arms officer and risking my life in operations around the world, I can't believe that in 2024, we still have to justify the contribution of women to defense and service in their country,"" she said. ""I wouldn't want anyone to leave this forum with the idea that this is some kind of social experiment.""Her remarks received a standing ovation from the audience, which included defense and security officials from various Western democracies.Carignan was promoted to the rank of general during a change-of-command ceremony this summer, becoming Canada’s first female defense chief—a position appointed by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau 's government.A trailblazer in the Canadian Armed Forces, she was also the first woman to command a combat unit. Her illustrious career includes deployments to Iraq, Afghanistan, Bosnia, and Syria.For the past three years, she served as the chief of professional conduct and culture, a role created in response to a 2021 sexual misconduct scandal.","Canada's top military official, General Jennie Carignan, called out US Senator Jim Risch's comments about the role of women in combat.

A US Senator and ally of President-elect Donald Trump , Lindsey Graham , has issued a warning to the UK and other nations about potential economic sanctions if they assist the International Criminal Court (ICC) in enforcing arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant. This comes after a statement from Downing Street suggested that Netanyahu could face arrest if he enters the UK due to the ICC warrant.The ICC issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant over alleged war crimes committed in Gaza, sparking outrage among US Republicans, including Senator Graham.""If you are going to help the ICC as a nation and enforce the arrest warrant against Bibi (Netanyahu) and Gallant… I will put sanctions on you as a nation,"" Graham said during an interview with Fox News.Graham stressed that countries aiding the ICC in arresting Israeli politicians would face economic consequences, specifically naming the UK, Canada, Germany, and France.“You’re gonna have to pick the rogue ICC versus America. I’m working with [Senator] Tom Cotton to pass legislation as soon as possible to sanction any country that aids or abets the arrest of any politician in Israel. What they’re doing in Israel is trying to prevent a second Holocaust. So, to any ally—Canada, Britain, Germany, France—if you try to help the ICC, we’re gonna sanction you,"" he said.When asked about the penalty, Graham responded: “We should crush your economy because we’re next…Why can’t they go after Trump or any other American president?”Graham further expressed his intent to collaborate with Trump and Congress on a strong response.“Any nation or organization that aids or abets this outrage should expect to meet firm resistance from the United States, and I look forward to working with President Trump , his team, and my colleagues in Congress to craft a powerful response,"" he posted on X.The UK government has expressed its respect for the ICC's independence and acknowledged its legal obligations regarding the arrest warrants.

How the ICC Decides on Cases





Genocide

War crimes

Crimes against humanity

Crimes of aggression

Decisions to issue arrest warrants follow these key steps:

1. Jurisdiction:

2. Investigation:

3. Authorization:





Who Must Comply



Arresting and transferring the accused to The Hague, where the ICC is headquartered.

Supporting investigations and facilitating evidence collection when requested.

Ensuring that their domestic laws allow for full cooperation with the ICC.

Challenges in Enforcement



With inputs from agencies

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expressed that Canada would comply with an International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu . He emphasized that Canada is committed to upholding international law and adhering to the regulations and rulings of international courts, framing this as a core value of Canadian identity.Trudeau said: “It’s really important that everyone abide by international law. This is something we’ve been calling on from the beginning of the conflict. We stand up for international law, and we will abide by all the regulations and rulings of the international courts. This is just who we are as Canadians.""On Thursday, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and former Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant, citing allegations of crimes against humanity and other offenses linked to the Israel-Hamas conflict, ongoing for over a year. The court also issued a warrant for Hamas military commander Mohammed Deif, though Israel claims he was killed in a Gaza airstrike in July. Both Israel and Hamas have denied the accusations.Trudeau reiterated Canada’s call for a ceasefire to protect civilians and emphasized the need for progress toward a two-state solution, envisioning peaceful coexistence between Israel and a Palestinian state. Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly echoed this stance, affirming Canada’s commitment to fulfilling its obligations under the ICC treaty.Netanyahu’s office criticized the arrest warrants, labeling them an antisemitic move, while Israel’s Ambassador to Canada, Iddo Moed, urged the Canadian government to reject and condemn the ICC decision, framing it as undermining Israel's right to self-defense.In contrast, the United States, not an ICC member, rejected the warrants outright, citing concerns about the ICC Prosecutor’s process and expressing its intent to coordinate responses with allies. The ICC, lacking its own enforcement mechanism, relies on its 124 member states, including Canada, to act on its rulings.The International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others based on allegations of crimes against humanity and other offenses. These charges reportedly stem from actions taken since the start of the prolonged conflict between Israel and Hamas. The court investigates and prosecutes cases of grave crimes, such as genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, particularly in situations where national legal systems are unable or unwilling to pursue justice.The ICC operates on the basis of complaints submitted to its Prosecutor, who then investigates whether there is sufficient evidence to pursue a case. This can include documentation from affected parties, states, international organizations, or civil society groups.The ICC was established in 2002 under the Rome Statute and has jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute:The ICC determines whether the alleged crimes fall within its jurisdiction, which applies to actions committed on the territory of member states or by nationals of member states.The Prosecutor gathers evidence, often involving extensive collaboration with states, international bodies, and witnesses.If sufficient evidence exists, the court issues an arrest warrant or summons for the individual.4. Charges: The charges must meet the standard of being serious violations of international humanitarian or human rights law.The ICC operates independently but is bound by its treaty and legal frameworks.All 124 member states of the ICC, including Canada, are legally obligated to comply with its rulings and execute arrest warrants if the accused enters their jurisdiction. Compliance involves:States that are not members, like the United States and Israel, are not legally obligated to comply with ICC warrants. However, the ICC may still pursue its cases if the alleged crimes occurred on the territory of a member state or involve nationals of member states.The ICC lacks its own enforcement mechanism, such as a police force, so it relies entirely on member states to cooperate. In many cases, political considerations or opposition to the ICC’s authority can hinder compliance, as seen with resistance from countries whose leaders or officials are targeted by ICC rulings.","The International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others.

The Future



In a fact that will make you do a double-take, Pam Bondi and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz are nearly the same age—Bondi at 58 and Walz at 59. Pam Bondi and Tim Walz are both 59 years old. Pam Bondi was born on November 17, 1965, and Tim Walz was born on April 6, 1964.Now, as Bondi’s name floats around as a potential pick for Attorney General under Donald Trump, it’s worth revisiting the meteoric rise of this Florida powerhouse.Pamela Jo Bondi, born November 17, 1965, in Tampa, Florida, is a seasoned attorney, former Florida Attorney General , and prominent figure in conservative circles. Known for her sharp legal mind and media-savvy approach, Bondi made waves during her two terms as Florida’s Attorney General from 2011 to 2019.A graduate of the University of Florida and Stetson University College of Law, Bondi began her career as a prosecutor in Hillsborough County. Her passion for public service and ability to navigate complex legal landscapes quickly elevated her profile within Florida politics.As Florida Attorney General, Bondi tackled major issues, including:Her legal acumen gained national attention in 2020 when she joined Donald Trump's legal team during his first impeachment trial. Her ability to deliver sharp, memorable arguments cemented her place as a trusted Trump ally.However, her career has not been without controversy. Critics have pointed to donations from Trump's foundation to Bondi's political action committee while her office was deciding on a case involving Trump University—a matter she ultimately declined to pursue.Now being floated as a top contender for Attorney General in a potential Trump administration , Bondi’s fiery conservatism and seasoned legal expertise could make her a key figure in the next chapter of Trump’s political saga.In the 2024 US presidential election , Vice President Kamala Harris selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate, but their ticket was decisively defeated by Trump and Vance. The Harris-Walz campaign struggled to connect with working-class voters, facing criticism over economic issues and governance challenges. Despite the loss, Walz’s selection highlighted his leadership record as a progressive governor and former congressman.","Pamela Jo Bondi, born November 17, 1965, is a seasoned attorney, former Florida Attorney General, and prominent figure in conservative circles.

Adul Nabi Bangash, a local politician in Parachinar, the district headquarters, told TOI that on Friday night a group of Shia Muslims attacked Sunni areas, such as Bagan bazaar, with light and heavy weapons. He revealed that both sides had raised militias soon after Thursday’s incident.A local administration official said the dead in the latest clashes included 18 Shias and 14 Sunnis. Nearly 50 others were wounded in overnight fighting.Dr Qaisar Abbas, a district health officer in Kurram, confirmed the casualties and described the condition of nine wounded as serious.Eyewitnesses said armed men broke into stores, petrol stations, homes and govt buildings in Kurram’s Bagan and Bacha Kot neighbourhoods after Friday prayers. Social media users shared videos and pictures of a burning market with orange flames piercing the night sky. Gunfire can also be heard in the background.Businesses, educational institutions and markets remained closed across Parachinar and surrounding areas for the second consecutive day on Saturday. Describing the situation as extremely tense, officials said mobile phone signals remain suspended across the district. Internet services, however, have been blocked in the region for several months.About 150 people have been killed in recent months due to escalating sectarian violence in the mountainous district, which borders Afghanistan on three sides.Previous clashes in July and Sept, which had killed dozens of people, ended only after a council of elders called for a ceasefire.Meanwhile, thousands of people participated in a sit-in in Parachinar, where protesters criticised govt’s failure to protect civilians. Shop owners in the region had announced a three-day strike on Friday to protest against the attack while locals described an atmosphere of fear across the district.No one has claimed responsibility for the attack, which came a week after authorities had reopened a key highway in the region that had been closed for months following deadly clashes. Speculation also surrounds the involvement of the banned terrorist group Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which has recently been active in the lower part of Kurram. But govt officials attributed the incident to a land dispute.","The sectarian violence follows Thursday’s deadly attack on a convoy of around 200 vehicles in Kurram.

In addition, the party wants to speak out against the manipulation of the Feb 8 general elections and demand steps to protect judicial independence, which it claims has been compromised by the 26th Constitutional Amendment. The govt denies this.PM Shehbaz Sharif’s administration has vowed to suppress PTI’s power show with full force and has warned of arrests if anyone comes out to join the demonstration.Govt has deployed security forces, enforced a sweeping ban on gatherings, blocked all roads with shipping containers in the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi, and launched a crackdown on leaders and workers of the opposition party in a bid to stop the protest.According to police 6,325 officers of the Islamabad police, alongside 21,500 personnel from other forces — 5,000 Rangers (paramilitary force), 5,500 Frontier Constabulary (FC) personnel, 9,000 Punjab police personnel, and 2,000 Sindh police personnel have been deployed to stop PTI protesters from entering the capital city.Responding to criticism over sealing Islamabad and blocking main highways and motorways, defence minister Khawaja Asif described these actions as a “lesser evil”, arguing that allowing protesters into the capital could result in greater devastation.However, Ali Amin Gandapur, PTI’s CM of northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, reiterated the call to all Pakistanis to join the protest. “It is imperative for us to leave our homes to protest the illegal incarceration of Imran Khan,” he proclaimed in a video message. “We all have to reach Islamabad and not leave until our demands are met,” he continued, saying PTI wanted Khan’s release along with the return of its mandate in the last general election, which the party said was rigged to keep it out of power.“Since the protest call is from Imran Khan, we will not go back until our demands are met,” he vowed.Earlier this year Pakistan’s parliament had passed legislation regulating public demonstrations in the capital, including designated protest areas and specific timings for rallies.

PESHAWAR: A mob ransacked and set fire to two police check points on Friday to protest the killing of nearly 50 people by militants in the restive province in northwest Pakistan . Heavily-armed militants on Thursday ambushed dozens of vehicles carrying passengers in Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, killing around 50 people, mostly Shias, in one of the worst attacks in the region in recent years.Rescue authorities said around 50 people, including eight women and five children, were killed and 20 others injured in the attack while police initially confirmed 45 deaths. The toll was raised to 47 on Friday.No group claimed responsibility for the attack on passenger vans.On Friday, in response to the Thurday's killings, all markets and educational institutions in Parachinar remained closed even as enraged locals blocked the main road by burning tires.After a lot of protests, the crowd ransacked Bab-e-Kurram, an entry point to Baggan Main Bazar and burnt two police check points at Palachinar.Deputy Commissioner Kurram Javed Ullah Mehsud said efforts are underway to save the lives of those injured in the barbaric shooting. ""We will restore the routine life as quickly as possible,"" he said.A grand jirga (traditional council) will be called to discuss problems hampering restoration of peace in the district.Meanwhile, funeral prayers were offered for the individuals who were killed in the incident in Bagan and Ochit, Lower Kurram.Tribal leaders from Turi and Bangash communities, including Jalal Bangash, expressed their deep concerns.They stated that for the past one and a half months, they had been demanding the government to ensure safe travel routes.Two weeks ago, more than 1,00,000 people participated in a peace march to reopen and secure the main highway, after which the government assured them of safe convoys.In September, more than 50 people were killed and 120 others injured in clashes spread over eight days between Shia and Sunni tribes over a piece of land in Kurram district.The intensity of the fighting had led to the closure of the Parachinar-Peshawar main road and the Pak-Afghan Kharlachi border, disrupting transportation and movement.The road blockade has caused a shortage of essential items, including food, fuel, and medicines, worsening the situation for residents.The fighting had spread to areas such as Balishkhel, Sadda, Khar Kallay, Peewar and Maqbal in the district, which borders Afghanistan's Khost, Paktia, Logar and Nangarhar provinces, which are considered strongholds of the ISIS and the Pakistan Taliban.Similar clashes in the same region in July left dozens of people dead and more than 225 injured.","Heavily-armed militants on Thursday ambushed dozens of vehicles carrying passengers in Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

History of sectarian violence in Kurram district

Heavily-armed militants ambushed ambushed dozens of vehicles carrying passengers in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kurram district on Thursday, killing around 50 people, mostly from the minority Shia community. The attack is one of the worst in recent years in Pakistan's volatile northwest, a region frequently plagued by sectarian violence and militant assaults.The convoy was en route from Parachinar to Peshawar when gunmen opened fire. Javed Ullah Mehsud, the deputy commissioner of Kurram, confirmed that 45 people have died in the attack on the convoy, while rescue teams rushed to assist the wounded.Although no group has officially claimed responsibility for the attack, the region is known to be under the influence of the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which has been linked to similar attacks in the area.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) government spokespersons indicated that the convoy, initially reported to have included 200 vehicles, was traveling through areas dominated by militant groups, raising fears of further escalations in an already tense region.Pakistan’s President Asif Ali Zardari strongly condemned the ambush, calling it a ""cowardly and inhumane act"" and urging that those responsible be brought to justice. He also called for immediate medical aid for the injured.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif echoed Zardari’s sentiments, terming the attack a “brutal” assault on innocent citizens. ""The enemies of the peace of the country attacked the convoy of innocent citizens which is tantamount to brutality. All attempts of anti-national elements to destroy the peace of the beloved country will be thwarted,"" he stated, promising to track down the perpetrators.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur also condemned the attack, directing a delegation of provincial officials to visit Kurram district to assess the situation and report back. He has also ordered the establishment of a Provincial Highways Police unit to secure roads in the region.""Targeting innocent civilians is extremely tragic and condemnable. Those involved in this incident will not escape the grip of the law,"" Gandapur added, offering condolences to the victims' families and announcing financial assistance for them.The area has long been a hotspot for sectarian tensions between Shia and Sunni Muslims, primarily stemming from a longstanding land dispute.This volatile region has witnessed multiple sectarian clashes this year. In October, at least 16 people, including women and children, were killed in similar violence. In September, more than 50 people were killed and 120 injured in clashes between Shia and Sunni tribes over land disputes. This violence led to the closure of critical roads and disrupted essential services in the area. Similar clashes in July resulted in dozens of deaths and hundreds of injuries.Kurram district borders Afghanistan’s Khost, Paktia, Logar, and Nangarhar provinces, known as strongholds for groups like ISIS and the Pakistani Taliban, complicating efforts to curb violence in the area.","Militants ambushed dozens of vehicles carrying passengers in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kurram district on Thursday, killing around 50 people.

It came a day after four people, including a tribal chief and a woman, were killed and as many injured when unknown armed men opened fire on a vehicle in Bannu.The latest attack, according to the army’s handout, triggered an exchange of fire in which six terrorists were gunned down and the attempt to enter the post effectively thwarted by troops, forcing the terrorists to detonate an explosives-laden vehicle at the post’s perimeter wall. “The suicide blast led to the collapse of a portion of the perimeter wall and damaged the adjoining infrastructure, as a result of which 12 soldiers lost their lives,” the statement added.There has been a sharp rise in the number of attacks targeting security forces, other law enforcement agencies, and security checkpoints, particularly in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Bannu has seen heightened militant violence of late, including the abductions of cops, attack on a prison, attack on a girls’ school, and shootouts that have left several security officials dead.On Monday, over half a dozen policemen were abducted from a checkpost in an adjacent North Waziristan tribal district. They were later recovered by police, with the help of tribal elders.Over the weekend at least eight security personnel were killed and three injured in fierce gun battles with militants in Tirah valley of Khyber tribal district, bordering Afghanistan.On Saturday, at least seven security officials were killed and 18 others wounded in Baluchistan’s Kalat region in a pre-dawn terrorist attack on a checkpost.

It, however, did not give any details about when the military operation would be launched and in which parts of the province.Restive Balochistan, Pakistan’s biggest province by area but poor in terms of development, has been home to a nearly two-decade-old insurgency by separatist militant groups of ethnic Baloch nationals who carry out frequent attacks against the govt, army, and Chinese interests in the region.

He also decried the “enforced disappearances, brutality, and violence” against PTI workers.Khan’s statement followed his wife Bushra Bibi’s recent warning to PTI politicians about tickets for the next general election. “The party tickets for the next general elections are linked with the performance of the PTI leadership during the upcoming protest in Islamabad,” she said, describing it as Imran’s message to the party leadership.On Monday, PTI had announced it would not end its sit-in until its stolen mandate was returned, the constitution restored, and Imran set free.","Khan urges everyone to join the protest on November 24. “The nation will not accept any excuse at such a critical time,” he said.

This indictment followed several breaches relating to the riots that took place on May 9, 2023.During a hearing at Kot Lakhpat Jail on Monday, Qureshi labeled these charges as baseless and politically motivated.

Extortions bleed Pak’s terror-stalked northwest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/extortions-bleed-paks-terror-stalked-northwest/articleshow/115454371.cms,"TOI

ISLAMABAD: Surging terror and extortions have endangered public safety in Pakistan ’s restive northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where militants in several districts run a parallel shadow administration.The southern districts of the province have almost become no-go areas even for law-enforcers. In the evening, militants are seen patrolling the streets and setting up checkpoints in Bannu, North and South Waziristan, Tank, Lakki Marwat, and Dera Ismail Khan regions.While these districts remain at mercy of militants from evening to morning, well-off people in other districts of the province frequently receive threatening WhatsApp texts and letters from Pakistani Taliban -- or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) -- with demands to pay or face attacks. The ones who refuse to pay ransom are often targeted with grenade attacks at their homes, shops and warehouses, apparently to show the group was serious about its threats.Faisal Khan, a lawyer in Umerzai area in Charsadda district, toldthat he had received a threatening WhatsApp text earlier this month from an Afghanistan number with a demand to pay $50,000 (Pak Rs 1.4cr).Khan claims that after reporting the threats to the police, he went to high-ranking officers to request protection and assistance. Most official discussions, he said, concluded with cautious assurances.“A family goes through pain for months after such a call. Even after approaching the cops, the victims are normally asked to install CCTV cameras, restrict movement and take care of security themselves,” Khan said. He also revealed that he was cautioned by “allies in the govt” that he “should not count” on them to keep him safe. “Either pay up or move your family to Islamabad or Lahore,” he said in reference to a private communication with some officials after he pressed for assistance.Last week, Khan said he had received a parcel carrying a shroud and other items required before burials. “This was followed by a threatening message to vacate my home within 30 minutes,” Khan said, adding he has refused to pay the extortioners.However, Shahzaib, another person in the same neighbourhood who had received a similar text on TTP’s letterhead last month, has paid after negotiating a deal through intermediaries. He eventually paid a reduced part of the $50,000 the militants initially demanded.“The key thing I learnt was that TTP is demanding extortion from everyone they think can pay. Most, if not all, wealthy individuals have already paid,” Shahzaib said.According to police, the main hurdle for law-enforcers in tracking down extortionists is the calls which they make from non-local lines, internet-generated resources, illegal gateways and Whatsapp numbers.Apart from various groups, the police said, criminal rings are also found involved in many such calls. In the last two years, police sources said at least 1,600 Afghan phone numbers and 387 illegal gateways were used for making extortion calls. These numbers and illegal gateways, according to the police, have been shared with higher authorities for follow-up action. “Despite the alarming increase in Taliban extortion demands, the issue has yet to attract national attention,” a senior police official said.","The southern districts of the province have almost become no-go areas even for law-enforcers.

Eight soldiers were killed and seven police officers abducted in separate incidents in northwest Pakistan on Tuesday, officials told news agency AFP. The Pakistani Taliban has claimed responsibility for the assaults.The first attack occurred on Monday, where a clash between security forces and militants left ""eight soldiers"" and ""nine militants"" dead, according to an intelligence official who spoke anonymously.In a separate incident, seven police officers were abducted, a senior police official confirmed.These incidents follow a series of recent militant operations in Pakistan. Just last week, seven paramilitary soldiers were killed in an attack by Baloch separatists on a border post in Balochistan province . The same group, the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), was responsible for a deadly railway station bombing earlier this year that killed 26 people, including 14 soldiers.Militant groups like the BLA and the Pakistani Taliban frequently target security forces and infrastructure, claiming to fight for autonomy or ideological goals. Their activities have disrupted economic projects, particularly those involving foreign investment, such as Chinese-backed ventures in Balochistan.Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has condemned these attacks, vowing swift action against the perpetrators.","Pakistani Taliban claims responsibility for two attacks in northwest Pakistan.

He represented Kingston upon Hull East in Parliament for four decades, serving as an MP from 1970 to 2010.Prescott was a key figure in Blair’s New Labour project, bridging the gap between the party’s traditional left-wing and modernisers.As per BBC, he was known for his plain-spoken nature and was a loyal ally to Blair. He often acted as a mediator between Blair and then-Chancellor Gordon Brown during their turbulent partnership.During his tenure as deputy prime minister from 1997 to 2007, Prescott played a significant role in international climate negotiations, including theKyoto Protocol . His commitment to environmental protection and social justice earned him widespread respect.“John dearly loved his home of Hull, and representing its people was his greatest honour,” his family said in a statement.Despite his contributions, Prescott had a fiery persona, famously punching a protester who threw an egg at him in 2001. In later years, he defended Jeremy Corbyn ’s leadership and criticised Britain’s involvement in the Iraq war.

King Charles, reportedly battling cancer, faces increasing challenges within the royal family as tensions with his son, Prince William, and brother, Prince Andrew, escalate. Recent reports suggest that family divisions are straining efforts to maintain unity during his reign.Prince William recently sparked controversy with a public critique of royal leadership. In an interview during his trip to South Africa for the Earthshot Prize, the Prince of Wales outlined his vision for a modernized monarchy focused on impact, philanthropy, and collaboration. While William emphasized doing things differently for his generation, the remarks were interpreted as a thinly veiled criticism of his father's approach to governance. His comments, described by some as throwing King Charles ""under the bus,"" highlight growing rifts within the royal family.Meanwhile, King Charles has struggled to resolve issues surrounding his brother, Prince Andrew, the Duke of York. Early in 2023, Charles attempted to remove Andrew from Royal Lodge, the sprawling estate previously occupied by the Queen Mother. However, Andrew resisted, citing his lease agreement. In response, the King implemented measures to pressure Andrew, including cutting his private security detail and annual allowance, but the Duke of York has reportedly secured independent funding to remain at Royal Lodge, further defying his brother's authority.These tensions underscore the challenges King Charles faces as he attempts to balance his role as monarch while dealing with internal family disputes. The strain is compounded by his health, with reports suggesting that the 76-year-old King is undergoing cancer treatment.The unfolding events reveal a monarchy grappling with conflicting personal interests and strained loyalties. Prince William’s apparent eagerness to carve out his own vision for the monarchy and Prince Andrew's refusal to comply with the King's directives suggest a family divided. For King Charles, these challenges come at a time when unity and stability are essential to preserving the legacy of his reign.","Recent reports suggest that family divisions are straining efforts to maintain unity during his reign.
