HYDERABAD: At a time when a knife attack that left four Indian students injured in Russia has put the spotlight on the challenges faced by them in the country, latest external affairs ministry data shows that over 50% of all complaints of exploitation and racial discrimination reported by Indian students globally originate from Russia, with Moscow emerging as the biggest hotspot.As per the data, Indian students across 196 countries registered around 350 complaints of exploitation, harassment and racial discrimination in 2025. Of these, more than 200 came from Russia alone.What has raised serious concern is the steep rise in such cases over the past three years - from 68 complaints in 2023 to 78 in 2024, before surging to 201 in 2025. The majority of Indian medical students in Russia belong to states such as Rajasthan , Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh , Telangana, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. While Russia remains one of the most popular destinations for Indian students, particularly those pursuing medical education, due to relatively lower tuition fees and easier admission processes, the sharp increase in complaints has triggered serious safety concerns.Students in Russia whom TOI spoke to said they are routinely discriminated against by students from other countries, with some even alleging mental harassment by universities themselves, including threats of expulsion over minor issues or violations. They said many of their grievances never reach official channels due to fear of retaliation from varsities or complications related to visas and immigration.""During my sixth year, a group of foreign students attacked Indian students in the hostel kitchen over a minor argument and threatened them with a knife,"" said Kanishka K, a graduate from Bashkir State Medical University, Moscow. He reiterated that ""many such incidents are never reported because students are scared of being targeted or expelled"".Members of Foreign Medical Graduates associations admitted to widespread racial profiling, verbal abuse and a lack of institutional support for Indian students in Russia. ""Complaints are rarely taken seriously. Students suffer in silence as universities often sideline them,"" said D Kaushal, coordinator of All FMGs.He further claimed that while Russian regulations limit foreign intake to around 200 students per institution, some universities admit over 1,200 students and later expel them, sometimes even in sixth year, in violation of norms. ""Such expulsions leave students in severe financial and psychological distress,"" he said.Owing to the deteriorating situation, FMGs say many Indian students are now opting for Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan instead. ""The number of Indian students choosing Russia has declined significantly, by at least 50%, in recent years due to these issues. Moreover, since the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022, Indian students have shown declining interest in pursuing MBBS in Russia because of safety concerns and academic uncertainty,"" said Manoj Kumar, president of the FMGs Association of India.Meanwhile, replying to a recent LS query on Indian workers and students facing exploitation, detention, wage denial and racial discrimination abroad, minister of state for external affairs Kirti Vardhan Singh said dedicated officers have been posted in Indian missions and posts overseas to handle education and student welfare-related matters.""Our missions maintain regular contact with Indian students enrolled abroad and brief them on challenges and threats, if any, that they may confront during their stay there. Heads of missions and senior embassy officers visit foreign educational institutions in their respective countries of accreditation to interact with Indian students and students' associations,"" he said.","Over 50% of all complaints of exploitation and racial discrimination reported by Indian students globally originate from Russia.

NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha discussion on the Budget continued to be mired in the standoff between govt and the opposition, with LoP Rahul Gandhi 's insistence on being allowed to raise a few issues and govt's refusal to heed his plea stalling the transaction of business for the sixth consecutive day on Monday. Amid the standoff, opposition netas Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav accused the govt of avoiding a discussion on the Budget because it feared questions about the Indo-US trade deal and its impact on farmers, even as BJP claimed the opposition did not want the budget debated.Rahul, SP's Akhilesh, TMC's Abhishek Banerjee and DMK's T R Baalu met the Speaker to find a solution to the logjam after the House was adjourned for the day. Later, Rahul said he would be allowed to raise some issues on Tuesday, after which the Budget would be discussed. Opposition is also seeking revocation of suspension of its MPs.On Monday, when presiding officer Sandhya Roy did not allow Rahul to speak and called Shashi Tharoor to start the Budget discussion, the opposition raised a protest. Rahul said the Speaker had committed that he would be allowed to speak and the Chair was going back on its word.But parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju contested his claim as ""not being 100% correct"". Rijiju said he was present in the meeting of the Speaker and K C Venugopal, and it was decided that Rahul should spell out the issues he wanted to raise so that if he made any allegations against the Speaker, the latter could reply. ""There was no commitment that only the LoP would be allowed to speak,"" he said.Rahul told reporters that his issues include not allowing the LoP and the opposition to speak on the motion of thanks while a BJP MP was allowed to speak ""wild stuff"", and suspension of MPs. He said the opposition is disturbed by the ""idea floated"" that the PM faced a threat inside LS. ""The PM was scared of coming to the House not because of members, but because of what I was saying,"" he said, referring to his announcement Wednesday that he would give the book of Army chief M M Naravane on Chinese aggression to the PM if he came to the House. Meanwhile, the opposition walked out of RS after Chairman C P Radhakrishnan did not allow LoP Mallikarjun Kharge to talk about Rahul not being allowed to speak in the LS.Casting doubts about the govt's intent to run the House, Akhilesh and Rahul said the opposition is keen on a discussion because of ""dheel"" in the trade deal given by govt to US.",LoP Rahul Gandhi's insistence on being allowed to raise a few issues and govt's refusal to heed his plea stalling the transaction of business for the sixth consecutive day.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court cautioned on Monday constitutional court judges against assuming the role of domain experts and suggesting remedial steps and said it would be dangerous if they deviate from their primary duty to decide disputes as neutral umpires after considering rival submissions.The remark came from a bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant, justices Joymalya Bagchi and N V Anjaria on a petition filed by Jharkhand Public Service Commission challenging the Jharkhand HC's decision to direct deletion of two questions and award of one mark to either of two options to a question attempted by candidates appearing in a preliminary test for recruitment of judicial officers.""Should a constitutional court assume the role of super-examiner just because the test was for recruitment of judicial officers and the question related to law?

Should he interfere in examination question papers and answer keys relating to recruitment in the field of biochemistry? HC judges must leave these issues to domain experts,"" he added.The bench said the HC, on the administrative side, had framed the questions in consultation with JPSC. ""The power of reappreciation/reconsideration of answer sheets must be uniform for all examinations and not only for judicial service tests.HCs cannot be super-examiners, and such issues must be left to domain experts,"" it said.""If that is so, it is necessary that the HC, while exercising its power of judicial review, should have referred the issue to the administrative side of the HC for constituting an expert committee to revisit the answer sheets and answer keys,"" the bench said.The bench asked the HC to set up an expert committee that will include subject experts, including those from the fields of law and English, to reevaluate the answer keys and answer sheets.When the counsel sought early resolution of the controversy, the bench asked HC to resolve it within two weeks and send a report to JPSC.

Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla Likely To Face No-Confidence Motion After Naravane Memoir Row

NEW DELHI: The Delhi Police on Monday registered an FIR over the circulation of an unpublished book of ex-Chief of Army Staff General Naravane on social media, cops told news agency PTI.A row erupted over General Naravane’s book after Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi cited excerpts from the former Army chief’s unpublished memoir and accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of ""not fulfilling responsibility"" during the 2020 India-China military clashes in Ladakh.Speaking to reporters outside the Parliament the Congress leader said, “The speaker is saying that this book does not exist, Rajnath ji has said this book does not exist. This is Naravane ji's book wherein he has written the account of Ladakh...Narendra Modi ji did not fulfil his responsibility.”Rahul Gandhi's insistence on reading purported extracts from the yet-to-be-published Naravane's book shone the spotlight on the rules and regulations that restrict senior military officials from revealing classified information or crucial leadership decisions even after retirement.Meanwhile, Penguin Random House, which holds the publishing rights, said the book has ""not gone into publication. No copies of the book - in print or digital form - have been published, distributed, sold, or otherwise made available to the public"" by them.""In light of recent public discourse and media reporting, Penguin Random House India would like to clarify that we hold the sole publishing rights for the book Four Stars of Destiny, a memoir by General Manoj Mukund Naravane, former Chief of the Indian Army.

No copies of the book - in print or digital form - have been published, distributed, sold, or otherwise made available to the public by Penguin Random House India,"" the publishing house wrote on X.There has been no official word from the author or even the ministry on the status of the book.Senior military officials, particularly those dealing with classified information, are subject to regulations under the Official Secrets Act that restrict the publication of books or information even after retirement to prevent such classified material from becoming public.While a general one-year “cooling-off” period exists for taking up commercial or private employment, regulations for publishing secret content require prior government clearance.""Four Stars of Destiny"", a memoir of Naravane, who was Army chief from December 31, 2019, to April 30, 2022, remains unpublished due to pending clearance from the defence ministry regarding sensitive details on the 2020 Line of Actual Control (LAC) standoff and Agnipath scheme.If the said rules and regulations are violated, the government can take legal action and such violations can also lead to the withholding of part or all of the pension of the military official concerned, as per CCS (Pension) Rules. There are chances that if the memoir is published, it could “flare up” the LAC situation with China.In May-June 2020, Indian and Chinese troops engaged in violent face-offs along the LAC in eastern Ladakh and Sikkim, most notably during the June 15, 2020, clash in Galwan Valley that resulted in the death of 20 Indian soldiers. There were casualties on the Chinese side as well. This marked the deadliest confrontation in decades, leading to major troop escalations.Under the then General Naravane’s command, India and China held a series of ground-level talks that led to “disengagement” in a phased manner from the stand-off areas.

Deepam row: Piyush Goyal Accuses MK Stalin Govt Of Targeting Hindu Traditions

‘Hard To Believe Mighty State’s Fear Of Disturbance In Peace’

What’s the deepam row?

NEW DELHI: In a long-running dispute over religious practices on the Thiruparankundram hill in Madurai, the Supreme Court on Monday refused to interfere with a Madras high court judgment that permitted lighting of the Karthigai Deepam at a hilltop stone pillar and restricted Muslim prayers at a nearby site except during Ramzan and Bakri-Id.The high court had held that Muslims have no right to conduct any prayers at the Nellithoppu site except during Ramzan and Bakri-Id. The 33 cents of land is owned by the Sikkandar Badhusha Avuliya Dargah. The high court had also ruled that animal sacrifice cannot be permitted in the area.Challenging the verdict, M. Imam Hussain, a worshipper at the Dargah, approached the apex court.A bench comprising Justice Aravind Kumar and Justice PB Varale declined to interfere, describing the high court order as balanced. Appearing for the petitioner, Advocate Prashant Bhushan submitted that there has never been a law and order problem in the area.Justice Kumar responded that had there been no law and order issue, there would not have been a meeting of the Peace Committee.""It seems to be a very very balanced order,"" Justice Kumar said and Justice Varale agreed with it, according to the Live Law.""We do not propose to interfere with the order. Without expressing any opinion on rights of the parties, the impugned order stands upheld,"" the bench observed.The ruling stems from proceedings before the Madurai Bench of the Madras high court, which had upheld a single judge’s order permitting the Thiruparankundram Murugan Temple management to light the Karthigai Deepam at the Deepathoon, a stone pillar located on one of the peaks of the Thiruparankundram hill.A division bench confirmed the earlier ruling of Justice GR Swaminathan, directing that the ceremonial lamp be lit at the Deepathoon in addition to the other customary locations during the festival.The high court observed that the district administration ought to have treated the issue as an opportunity to bridge the gap between the communities through mediation. It further held that since the hill is a protected site, any activity carried out there must strictly comply with the provisions of the relevant law.The court clarified that the lamp may be lit and the number of persons permitted can be fixed, subject to consultation with the Archaeological Survey of India. With this, the court cleared the way for continuation of the practice, dismissing objections raised against lighting the lamp at the hilltop stone pillar.Thiruparankundram hill, rising at the edge of Madurai, carries a layered religious history spanning more than two millennia. Revered as one of the six abodes of Lord Murugan, it houses the ancient Subramaniya Swamy Temple and has references in Sangam-era literature.Archaeological traces reveal Jain presence dating back over 2,300 years. By the 14th century, the hill also became associated with Sikandar Shah, whose memorial evolved into the Sikkandar Badusha Dargah. For generations, temple festivals and dargah observances unfolded in proximity, with local residents describing shared rituals and overlapping traditions rather than rigid divisions.The current dispute centres on where the Karthigai Deepam should be lit during the annual festival. Historically, the lamp was lit at the Uchipillaiyar mandapam. Petitions beginning in the 1990s sought to shift the lighting to the hilltop Deepathoon pillar. Courts had earlier declined to alter established practice.However, a fresh petition in 2024 argued that the 1920s Privy Council decree recognising temple ownership of the hill permitted lighting at the pillar.Justice G R Swaminathan allowed the hilltop lighting, triggering administrative resistance on law and order grounds and eventually escalating into a political flashpoint between the ruling DMK and the BJP, before reaching the Supreme Court.",The Supreme Court refused to interfere with a Madras high court judgment that permitted lighting of the Karthigai Deepam at a hilltop stone pillar. The high court had held that Muslims have no right to conduct any prayers at the Nellithoppu site except during Ramzan and Bakri-Id. The court also ruled that animal sacrifice cannot be permitted in the area.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128109732,imgsize-63216,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-8.jpg"

Himanta replies 'ready to go to jail'



NEW DELHI: AIMIM chief and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi on Monday lodged a formal complaint with the Hyderabad city police seeking criminal action against Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma over a now-deleted video that allegedly depicted him shooting at Muslims.“I have lodged an official complaint with CP Hyderabad City Police demanding criminal action against Himanta Sarma for his (now deleted) violent video showing him shooting Muslims. Unfortunately, genocidal hate speech has become a norm,” Owaisi said in a post on X.According to the complaint addressed to the Hyderabad commissioner of police, Owaisi alleged that Sarma has, over the years, made repeated statements targeting the Muslim community through social media, print media and public speeches.He claimed that these statements had intensified in recent months with the intent to “outrage the religious feelings of Muslims” and promote enmity between religious communities.The complaint specifically refers to a video posted on the official X handle of the Assam Bharatiya Janata Party on February 7, 2026, which was taken down the following day but continues to circulate on other social media platforms.Owaisi alleged that the video portrayed Sarma armed with a firearm and aiming it at individuals “very obviously depicted as Muslims,” accompanied by phrases such as “Point blank shot” and “No Mercy.”Owaisi argued that the imagery and language used in the video amounted to a “deliberate and malicious act” intended to promote communal hatred and incite violence. He stated that he had viewed the video within the jurisdiction of the Hyderabad police, seeking to establish territorial jurisdiction.In his complaint, Owaisi cited the Supreme Court’s ruling in Shaheen Abdulla v Union of India & Ors, which directed law enforcement agencies to take suo motu action in cases of hate speech and held that inaction would amount to a dereliction of constitutional duty.He urged the police to initiate immediate legal action against the Assam chief minister in accordance with the law.On AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi filing a case against him over a now-deleted video of him, Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma says, ""I am ready to go to jail, what can I do? I do not know anything about any video. If he has filed a case against me, arrest me; what objection do I have? I have no objection. But I stand by my words, I am against Bangladeshi infiltrators and I will continue to be against them.""On being asked about the complaint by Owaisi, Sarma said, “I'll be ready to go to jail”, if a case has been filed against me. What can I do? He went on to say he doesn't mind a case against him but will always stand by my words, and continue to oppose “Bangladeshi’s infiltrators.”Sarma said, ""I am ready to go to jail, what can I do? I do not know anything about any video. If he has filed a case against me, arrest me; what objection do I have? I have no objection. But I stand by my words, I am against Bangladeshi infiltrators and I will continue to be against them.""","AIMIM chief and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi on Monday lodged a formal complaint with the Hyderabad city police seeking criminal action against Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma.

GURGAON: Abdul Rahman, a 20-year-old terror accused arrested for allegedly plotting an attack on Ram Temple in Ayodhya, was killed inside Faridabad district jail early on Monday after another inmate attacked him with a sharp-edged object.Rahman was assaulted around 2am while he was asleep, allegedly by Arun Chaudhary, a Kashmiri youth lodged in the same prison. Police said Chaudhary struck Rahman repeatedly on the head, leaving him critically injured. Jail staff provided him first aid, but he died before he could be taken to hospital.ACP Ashok Kumar said police received a letter from jail authorities about the alleged murder. ""Arun Chaudhary attacked Rahman while he was sleeping around 2am. We have registered a murder case against him. The jail authorities initially gave the victim first aid, but he died. His body was sent to the mortuary of BK Civil Hospital for an autopsy,"" he added.Kumar said Chaudhary would be taken into police custody on a production warrant as local cops are not authorised to interrogate an accused on jail premises. ""Once we take him into custody, we will ascertain the exact reason behind their tussle and murder. Rahman's family has been informed. The autopsy will be conducted after they arrive in Faridabad.A judicial probe was already launched in the case in keeping with protocol,"" he added. Chaudhary was shifted from a Jammu jail to Faridabad in Oct 2024, police said. He has eight cases against him, including trespassing, attempted murder and murder.Rahman, a resident of Milkipur in UP's Faizabad district, was arrested on March 2, 2025, near Pali village in Faridabad during a joint operation by Gujarat ATS and Haryana STF. Two hand grenades recovered from him were later defused by bomb disposal squads.Rahman, according to cops, was staying in Faridabad under a fake identity and blended into the local community by working as an autorickshaw driver and at a small eatery. He stayed at a secluded pump house on the city's outskirts.Security agencies had flagged him as a key operative tasked with reconnaissance of sensitive locations, including the Ram Temple in Ayodhya and administrative buildings in the state. Digital devices seized during his arrest allegedly contained videos and material linked to the temple, along with instructions and details of the planned attack.Officials had earlier said the grenades found with Rahman had been sourced through handlers linked to Pakistan's ISI via networks associated with Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP).Though no date was fixed, agencies assessed that the planned strike was intended at triggering mass casualties and panic. This prompted a coordinated probe by central and state agencies to identify sleeper cells, local facilitators and logistical support.Police said prison security arrangements were also being reviewed after Rahman's killing, and inmates and staff questioned to establish the sequence of events leading to the attack.","Abdul Rahman, a 20-year-old terror accused arrested for allegedly plotting an attack on Ram Temple in Ayodhya, was killed inside Faridabad district jail early on Monday.

NAVI MUMBAI: Police have arrested a quack after a 21-year-old woman, who was suffering from hormonal disorder, died allegedly after he administered injections at her Vashi residence on Feb 5.The accused, Sandesh Pashte (30), is a Mankhurd resident who works as a ward boy in a nursing home in Andheri, said senior inspector Shashikant Chandekar of Vashi police station.The deceased woman was identified as Prachiti Bhuvad, a resident of Giridhar Niwas building in Vashi Sector 11.Police registered an FIR against Pashte under relevant sections of BNS for culpable homicide not amounting to murder and cheating and arrested him after the woman's father, Bhikuram Bhuvad, filed a complaint on Feb 6. On Monday, he was remanded to police custody till Feb 10.Vashi NMMC Hospital's medical superintendent Dr Prashant Jawade said, ""As it is a case of death due to medical negligence, after the woman's post-mortem examination, the preliminary autopsy report mentions an opinion reserved for cause of death. The viscera sample has been preserved for histopathology and sent to Kalina FSL for confirmation of the cause of death.""Bhuvad told police that his daughter suffered from PCOD (Polycystic Ovarian Disease), and his niece Priyanka Mahadik suggested Pashte for treatment, who had claimed in the locality that he was a physician and made home visits.

The building's fire safety equipment was also used.While a fire official said the cause of the blaze was yet to ascertained, neighbours and witnesses said a diya had been kept lit in the house temple as part of wedding rituals and it was likely that a mattress placed nearby first caught fire.A family acquaintance said only the two women—Bhavana Bharat Satra (62), wife of a developer, and Aneri Jitendra Satra (34)—were inside the flat, while other family members were on the terrace.Officials said the fire was reported around 9.40am and fire engines reached within minutes. They said both women were rescued and rushed to Nanavati Hospital in Vile Parle. Bhavana was declared dead before admission and Aneri, who suffered 6% burns, was admitted to the ICU. Firefighters were able to bring the blaze under control at 12.54pm.Rescuers doused the flames using three hose lines—two small hose lines and one high-pressure line—deployed from five motor pumps. Additional support was provided through a hose line from a turntable ladder and another from the building's fixed firefighting system. Senior fire officers, along with station officers and fire brigade personnel, supervised the operation.A total of five fire engines, two tankers, two aerial water tower tenders, a hydraulic platform, a turntable ladder, a breathing apparatus van and an ambulance were deployed.","A 62-year-old woman died in a fire in her Vile Parle flat, a day before her son's wedding.

AHMEDABAD: A local court found a Rajkot man guilty of harassing his wife by forcing her to participate in the customary gambling sessions during the holy month of Shravan. His family members were also held guilty, while he was ordered to pay her a monthly maintenance and contribute to the house rent under the Domestic Violence Act.According to the case details, the woman, now living in Nikol, married a grocer from Rajkot in Jan 2017. Things were fine until Shravan, when her in-laws insisted she take part in sessions of gambling because everyone in the household did. She refused, saying she came from an ""educated family"" and would not do so. That changed the family's behaviour towards her, the complaint states. Her in-laws allegedly began pressuring her to bring money from her parents to support their gambling parties, which also involved the family's acquaintances, even if she did not want to participate.The complaint states the dispute escalated with the family creating a situation where she felt that if she did not take part in their gambling get-togethers, she would have to divorce her husband. She left her matrimonial home in 2019.After she left, her in-laws filed an FIR accusing her of cheating and taking their heirloom jewellery with her. The woman then approached the JMFC court in Ahmedabad rural, filing a complaint against her husband and five of his relatives, alleging domestic violence and that she was forced to leave her marital home.The in-laws denied the allegations, calling her claims false and pointing to their police complaints against her. The court, however, accepted her account of harassment. As she could not prove the husband's income, the court set maintenance at Rs 5,000 per month based on the typical earnings of an able-bodied person, and directed him to pay an additional Rs 2,000 per month towards house rent.","A court found a Rajkot man guilty of harassing his wife by forcing her to participate in the customary gambling sessions during the holy month of Shravan.

KANPUR: A cop has been shunted and an FIR registered against Shivam Mishra (35), Kanpur tobacco tycoon KK Mishra's son who was allegedly driving a Lamborghini that spun out of control on Sunday, leaving at least three people injured and several vehicles damaged.Shivam will undergo tests to determine if he has epilepsy or any other condition that might have caused the crash. His family claimed he had a seizure while driving the car costing over Rs 10 crore. Area SHO Santosh Gaur has been removed.No arrests have been made yet in connection with the accident, which has intensified scrutiny on Mishra, whose firm Banshidhar Exports has been under the tax scanner and his family under glare for their lavish lifestyle.

GHAZIABAD: A local court has sent a 26-year-old man to life in prison for the murder of his wife, while relying on the testimony of the adopted teenage daughter of the deceased woman, who witnessed the crime in 2021, to convict the accused.The girl's biological father, Guddu Khan, had given her away to his sister, Sahana, since she had no children of her own. The convict, Shamshad alias Raju, and Sahana had only been married for 70 days before the crime.The case stems from an FIR lodged with the Nandgram police by Guddu on November 28, 2021, accusing Shamshad of killing his sister the previous night. Based on the complaint, police registered the case under sections 302 (murder), 323 (voluntarily causing simple hurt) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code and seized the paper cutter used by the convict to slit his wife's throat. Shamshad went into hiding and was arrested nearly a year-and-a-half later on February 24, 2023. Police had declared a bounty of Rs 25,000 for his arrest.After Shamshad's arrest, police filed a chargesheet and the court took cognisance on March 29, 2023, and framed charges within two months. He pleaded not guilty and sought a trial.The prosecution presented 11 witnesses, including the teenage girl, Afreen, who was an eyewitness to the entire incident.Apart from Guddu, the testimony given by family members, neighbours and the doctor who conducted the autopsy also proved crucial in deciding the case.Aafreen told the court that she was sleeping beside her mother when she suddenly woke up hearing a fight between her parents. She said that while Shamshad wanted to relocate to Delhi, her mother was reluctant, and both started arguing. ""It was in a fit of rage that my father sat on my mother, held her by the hair with his left hand and, using a cutter, slit her throat,"" she told the court.She added that she started screaming and tried to run out of the room for help, but Shamshad slapped her and threatened to kill her if she informed anyone. He then escaped, leaving the door open, following which the girl went to neighbours for help.Her statement was corroborated by Guddu.""Since my sister had no children of her own, she adopted my daughter and, after the second marriage, started living with the convict in a house close to ours,"" he said. He further said that he was not aware of their fights, as it had only been 70 days since their wedding when the incident took place.The defence questioned Afreen's statement on the grounds that the adoption of Aafreen by Sahana and Shamshad was not proven. It was also argued by the defence that this was Sahana's second marriage, while the prosecution did not present convincing evidence regarding her divorce from her first husband.However, the court said that it must neither conclude whether Aafreen was adopted by the deceased nor if her adoption was relevant to the case.""It is noteworthy that PW2 (Afreen) is the only eyewitness to the incident and gave a natural and credible testimony. Neither her examination-in-chief nor her cross-examination revealed any facts that would cast doubt on her testimony. Furthermore, there is no material contradiction between this witness and the testimony of other witnesses in the case,"" the court observed, ruling that, with the testimony of the doctor, it was established beyond doubt that the deceased died after her throat was slit.Additional sessions judge Arwind Mishr, while pronouncing the man guilty on Saturday, desisted from awarding capital punishment after weighing the circumstances and awarded life imprisonment, imposing a total fine of Rs 1.06 lakh.In compliance with Section 357 of the CrPC (victim compensation), the court considered the eyewitness, Afreen, the victim instead of the plaintiff in the case, and ordered that 90% of the fine amount be given to her as compensation.","A court has sentenced a 26-year-old man to life in prison for the murder of his wife.

GHAZIABAD: Police have recovered a mobile phone belonging to one of the three sisters who allegedly died by suicide after jumping from their ninth-floor home in Bharat City, marking the first potential digital lead in a case that has so far relied largely on the family’s account.The handset had been sold by their father around 15 days before the girls’ deaths and was seized from an electronics shop in Shalimar Garden. Police said the phone has been sent for forensic examination to retrieve deleted data, including apps, browsing history and social media activity.DCP (trans-Hindon) Nimish Patil said the father, Chetan Kumar, had bought two smartphones about six months ago for the eldest daughter and her 14-year-old half-sister, hoping they would gain popularity as YouTubers. “One phone was sold about three months ago, and the second just 15 days before the incident,” Patil said.The recovered phone was sold for Rs 15,000 and was still with the shop owner when police reached the store on Monday. “All crucial data appears to have been deleted before the phone was sold. We have sent it to a forensic lab to recover deleted content, including social media accounts and apps,” Patil said, adding that efforts were also underway to trace the second handset through surveillance.Investigators believe the phones could reveal what kind of online content the sisters were consuming, whether they were in touch with anyone outside the family, and how deeply they were immersed in social media. Police have said understanding the girls’ digital footprint is critical to reconstructing the circumstances leading up to their deaths.The sisters — aged 16, 14 and 12 — were found lying next to each other on the society premises on February 4, directly below their ninth-floor apartment window. They were taken to hospital and declared dead on arrival.Police said the girls had largely lived in isolation since the Covid pandemic, having stopped attending school and remaining cut off from peers. They reportedly spent most of their time consuming online content centred on Korean culture and had even launched a YouTube channel focused on K-dramas and animated characters, which garnered over 2,000 followers before being deleted about 10 days before their deaths. Officers said the channel was removed after their father objected to what he viewed as their growing fixation with Korean culture.Kumar allegedly told investigators that his daughters were “living in their own world” and frequently spoke about going to Korea after watching reels and other social media content.About three weeks before their deaths, the girls were taken to a private tutor, where they introduced themselves using Korean names — Maria, Aliza and Cindy — and claimed they had been adopted from Korea and China. The tutor told police the sisters were extremely weak in studies, struggling with basic calculations and even recognising numbers or copying letters from textbooks.“They had not been going to school since Covid and didn’t have books. When I tried basic additions and multiplications, they couldn’t recognise numbers,” the tutor said, adding that home assignments were left incomplete and the girls showed little academic focus.When questioned about their lack of preparation, the tutor said the girls repeated that they had been adopted from China and Korea — a claim their father later linked to their obsession with Korean culture. Disturbed by their condition and progress, the tutor said she stopped teaching them and returned the fees around 20 days before the incident.Police said the tutor’s account has been added to the case file as they await forensic inputs from the seized mobile phone.","Police have recovered a mobile phone belonging to one of the three sisters who allegedly died by suicide after jumping from their ninth-floor home in Bharat City.

NEW DELHI: A 25-year-old biker who died after falling into an uncovered Delhi Jal Board (DJB) pit in the Janakpuri area last week succumbed to traumatic asphyxia with suffocation, according to the post-mortem report.The report noted that the biker was found lying in a prone position inside the pit.At this stage, the manner of death appears to be accidental, the source said, adding that the exact time of death will be ascertained after further investigation.The post-mortem report also stated that the chest compression could have been caused by a heavy vehicle falling on the body. Burn injuries found on the victim’s right thigh were attributed to contact with the motorcycle’s silencer, the source added.Delhi Police have issued non-bailable warrants against two contractors in connection with the death of a 25-year-old biker who fell into an uncovered pit in Janakpuri.The warrants were issued against brothers Himanshu Gupta and Kavish Gupta, both contractors, an officer said. Police also extended the remand of Rajesh Kumar Prajapati, a subcontractor, by one day.Meanwhile, Yogesh, a labourer who was allegedly present at the site when the biker fell into the pit and failed to inform authorities in time, was remanded to judicial custody by the court.The victim, Kamal Dhyani, a private bank employee, had fallen into a nearly 15-foot-deep pit dug by the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) for sewer work in the Janakpuri area in the early hours of Friday.The police had earlier said that Yogesh, despite becoming aware of the incident after being alerted by a security guard, did not inform authorities and instead called Prajapati. He also allegedly misled the victim's family when they came searching for him during the night.Prajapati was arrested for allegedly failing to alert police or emergency agencies despite knowing about the fall hours before the incident was reported. Yogesh was arrested later in Uttar Pradesh.An FIR was registered at Janakpuri Police Station under Section 105 (culpable homicide) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita against the accused and the DJB officials. Police said efforts are on to trace the contractors against whom NBWs have been issued.","A 25-year-old biker who died after falling into an uncovered Delhi Jal Board pit in the Janakpuri area last week succumbed to traumatic asphyxia with suffocation, according to the post-mortem report.

BENGALURURelatives of Karnataka-born tech professional Chandan Kumar Raja Nandakumar, who was shot dead in a daylight attack outside a Toronto shopping mall, suspect that his efforts to form a Kannada association in Toronto may have played a role in what police are treating as a “targeted” killing.While the Toronto Police Service (TPS) has not indicated any motive so far, family members said Chandan was actively involved in organising Kannada cultural activities and was in the process of bringing together members of the community under a formal association.“We spoke to him last Friday. He said he would take leave and come home this summer. We were planning for his marriage. We are completely shattered,” his father, Nandakumar, said from their native Thyamagondlu village near Nelamangala in Bengaluru Rural district.The 37-year-old computer science graduate from Sapthagiri College, Bengaluru, had moved to Canada about six years ago and was working with LTI Mindtree, a subsidiary of Larsen & Toubro. He had earlier worked with Cognizant in Bengaluru.Chandan was seated inside his SUV when unidentified assailants opened fire near the entrance of Woodbine Shopping Centre, close to Rexdale Boulevard, around 3.30 pm local time on Saturday.Police said he sustained multiple gunshot wounds and was rushed to hospital with life-threatening injuries, where he later succumbed.Visuals from the scene showed Chandan’s white vehicle riddled with bullet holes, prompting investigators to classify the shooting as a “targeted” attack. The suspects fled in another vehicle, and no arrests have been made so far. This is Toronto’s third homicide this year.TPS Inspector Errol Watson said the incident had raised public safety concerns. “I can understand how a shooting like this, especially at a mall, can cause concern for the safety of the public,” he told reporters.The killing has sent shockwaves through the Indian diaspora in Canada, particularly among Kannadigas. Friends said Chandan was deeply involved in Kannada cultural circles in Toronto, promoting films, music and community events.Family members said he had repeatedly postponed returning to India. “Had he listened to us and come back earlier, he would have been with us now,” his father said.Karnataka home minister G Parameshwara said the state government was coordinating with the ministry of external affairs to bring Chandan’s body back to India. Chikkaballapur MP K Sudhakar said he was also in touch with MEA officials to facilitate the repatriation.His uncle, Murali Krishna, said the family was unable to understand why he was targeted. “He had built a stable life abroad and was working hard. He was the only son. We don’t know why this happened,” he said.","Chandan Kumar Raja Nandakumar, 37, was shot dead in a daylight attack outside a Toronto shopping mall.

Pandey chased the dogs away with a stick, allowing the girl to escape.The attack sparked anger and fear among residents. They said the population of stray dogs has gone up to about 150 in the locality. The girl’s father, Dattatraya Nikam, alleged that feeding of dogs at unauthorised spots within the housing society was responsible for this sharp rise. Pandey said stray dogs had attacked others in the past too.While locals sought that the administration implement a mechanism to control their population, a local, Mahesh Thombre, said KDMC passed the buck, saying the area wasn’t under its jurisdiction.","A nine-year-old girl headed for school was chased and attacked by a pack of about 10 stray dogs within the premises of her housing society.

Lawrence Bishnoi gang claims daylight killing of Delhi bizman in Bawana; issues chilling social media warning,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/lawrence-bishnoi-gang-claims-daylight-killing-of-delhi-bizman-in-bawana-issues-chilling-social-media-warming/articleshow/128142173.cms,"



NEW DELHI: In a chilling development that has sent shockwaves through the national capital, the notorious Lawrence Bishnoi gang has claimed responsibility for the daylight murder of a 35-year-old businessman in North Delhi ’s Bawana area. The victim, identified as Vaibhav Gandhi, was a plastic granules manufacturer who was intercepted and shot dead on Monday afternoon near his factory in Sector 4 of DSIIDC.The claim surfaced through a social media post authored by an account under the name “Randeep Malik Anil Pandit.” The post, which features a picture of an individual wearing a hoodie, explicitly states that the killing was carried out on behalf of the Lawrence Bishnoi, Jitender Gogi Maan, Hasim Baba, and Kala Rana gangs.Written in a mix of Hindi and English, the message alleges that Gandhi was “interfering” in their operations. “He was entering the middle of our call, so we exited him from his life,” the post read, adding a chilling warning that anyone who attempts to obstruct their “work” will be eliminated without prior notice.The incident occurred around 12:51 pm on Monday when Gandhi was reportedly standing outside his factory holding a laptop bag. According to preliminary police investigations, three bike-borne assailants approached him and attempted to snatch the bag.When Gandhi tried to flee, the gunmen chased him for nearly 50 metres, firing multiple rounds. A bullet hit him in the chin, causing him to collapse on the spot. The attackers then fled with his belongings.Police initially suspected the killing to be a case of robbery gone wrong. However, the emergence of a gang claim has shifted the focus of the investigation towards a deeper conspiracy involving extortion and organised crime.Multiple teams led by DCP (Outer-North) Hareshwar V. Swami have been formed to verify the authenticity of the social media post and trace the digital footprint of the “Randeep Malik” and “Anil Pandit USA” accounts mentioned in the claim.The Delhi Police Special Cell has also been roped in, given the alleged involvement of the Lawrence Bishnoi syndicate, which has been linked to several high-profile assassinations across the country. CCTV footage from the Bawana industrial area is being scanned to identify the shooters and track their escape route.","Lawrence Bishnoi gang claims responsibility for killing of plastic granules manufacturer.

BENGALURU: The speculation over a possible leadership change in Karnataka gained fresh momentum on Monday after Congress MLC Channaraj Hattiholi publicly backed deputy chief minister and state Congress president DK Shivakumar , claiming he enjoys the support of all 136 Congress MLAs in the Assembly.Hattiholi told ANI that Shivakumar has been running the party successfully for the past six years and enjoys the support of 136 MLAs.“DK Shivakumar has made it very clear, not 80, not 90, all 136 MLAs are in his support. He has been running the party successfully for the past six years... He has the support of 136 MLAs, he is the party chief for 136 MLAs, and all are happy with him. We are all in support of DK Shivakumar,” Hattiholi said.""He deserves to be CM of this state, and we all hope that he will be CM of Karnataka very soon, in this tenure,” Hattiholi added.Responding to the renewed buzz, DK Shivakumar sought to downplay speculation and said his focus remains on organisational work and public service.“Today, I have a meeting at AICC on political matters relating to various elections. Every day is good news, good life, a good beginning, a successful life for me.There is nothing else in this besides solving people's problems, which makes me happy,” Shivakumar said.Shivakumar also addressed recent remarks made by Congress MLC Yathindra Siddaramaiah, stressing that public statements for or against leaders only harm the party.“There is no confusion. When others make statements or give opinions in favour of me or against any MLA or minister, it causes damage to the party.

Trump threatens to stop launch of US-Canada bridge; demands halt until 'compensation' talks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-threatens-to-stop-launch-of-us-canada-bridge-demands-halt-until-compensation-talks/articleshow/128140880.cms,"



US President Donald Trump has threatened to block the opening of a new bridge connecting the United States and Canada, marking a fresh escalation in his criticism of the neighbouring country, which he has previously suggested should become the 51st US state.Trump said the United States should own “at least half” of the still under-construction Gordie Howe International Bridge, which links the Canadian province of Ontario with the US state of Michigan.In a post on Truth Social, Trump accused Canada of treating the United States “unfairly” and claimed it was “not compensating enough.” He wrote, “As everyone knows, the Country of Canada has treated the United States very unfairly for decades. Now, things are turning around for the U.S.A., and FAST! But imagine, Canada is building a massive bridge between Ontario and Michigan. They own both the Canada and the United States side and, of course, built it with virtually no US content. ”He further warned that he would prevent the bridge from opening unless Canada entered negotiations with the United States and provided what he described as adequate compensation for what the US “has given them.”“I will not allow this bridge to open until the United States is fully compensated for everything we have given them, and also, importantly, Canada treats the United States with the Fairness and Respect that we deserve,” Trump wrote in the Truth Social post.He then added that the United States would “start negotiations, IMMEDIATELY.”The Republican president also reiterated his complaint that Canada owned both sides of the bridge and had used “virtually” no US products in its construction.He wrote, “As everyone knows, the country of Canada has treated the United States very unfairly for decades. Now, things are turning around for the USA, and FAST! But imagine, Canada is building a massive bridge between Ontario and Michigan. They own both the Canada and the United States side and, of course, built it with virtually no U.S. content.”Work on the $4.7 billion bridge, named after late Canadian-born National Hockey League great Gordie Howe, began in 2018, and the project is expected to open later this year.According to a factsheet issued by the Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority, the bridge was financed entirely by Canada and will be jointly owned by the governments of Canada and the state of Michigan.Trump also criticised Canada’s broader foreign policy direction, writing, “And now, on top of everything else, Prime Minister (Mark) Carney wants to make a deal with China -- which will eat Canada alive. We'll just get the leftovers! I don't think so.”His remarks come amid heightened tensions after Washington threatened to impose 100 per cent tariffs on Canada following Carney’s visit to Beijing last month, where a preliminary trade agreement with China was announced.The US leader also repeated the claim that Beijing would “terminate ALL Ice Hockey being played in Canada,” a statement widely dismissed by critics.This is not the first time Trump has voiced dissatisfaction with trade arrangements between the two countries. Last month, during his address at the 56th Annual Summit of the World Economic Forum in Davos, he said Canada “gets a lot of freebies” from Washington and suggested that the country did not show sufficient gratitude.Since returning to the office in January 2025, Trump has repeatedly clashed with Canada over trade issues. He had earlier called for the United States to annexe Canada, though he has largely stepped back from that claim in recent months.Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, meanwhile, warned at the Davos forum that the US-led global system of governance is undergoing “a rupture,” in what was widely interpreted as a veiled reference to Trump’s policies, while calling for mid-level powers to work more closely together.",Trump said the United States should own “at least half” of the still under- construction Gordie Howe International Bridge. The $4.7 billion bridge links the Canadian province of Ontario with the US state of Michigan. The Republican president also reiterated his complaint that Canada owned both sides of the bridge and used “virtually” no US products in its construction.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128141276,imgsize-692972,width-400,resizemode-4/trump-threatens-to-stop-opening-of-a-us-canada-bridge.jpg"
Russia: Gunman who shot top general recruited by Kyiv,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/russia-gunman-who-shot-top-general-recruited-by-kyiv/articleshow/128134716.cms,"Russia Shaken After Murder Attempt Of Top Military General; Vladimir Alekseev Shot In Moscow | Putin





MOSCOW: Russia said Monday that a gunman who shot and wounded a top Russian military intelligence officer in Moscow last week before fleeing to Dubai was acting on Kyiv's orders. High-ranking general Vladimir Alekseyev was shot several times in his apartment block in Moscow and was hospitalised. There have been a string of assassinations of Russian army officials on Russian soil during Moscow's almost four-year Ukraine offensive.Russia's FSB security service said Russian citizen Lyubomir Korba, born in 1960, shot Alekseyev ""on the orders of Ukraine's SBU"" security services after being recruited and trained in Ukraine.FSB said Korba's son, who lives in Poland, was involved in his recruitment process. Moscow said over the weekend that a Russian man in his 60s was arrested in Dubai and handed over to Russia over the attempted killing. ""On the day of the assassination, Korba got into the building where the military man lived, waited until he appeared in the lift lobby and shot four times.""In a statement, FSB said Korba was recruited in Ukraine's Ternopil last year and sent into Russia through Moldova and Georgia, adding he was promised $30,000 for the killing.It said he acted with two accomplices - naming them as Viktor Vasin and Zinaida Serebritskaya.It accused Vasin of being a supporter of the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Ukraine has claimed some of the killings in Russia, but has denied being behind the attempt on Alekseyev. Kremlin admitted last week that army officials in Russia were under threat during the offensive in Ukraine. afp",High-ranking general Vladimir Alekseyev was shot several times in his apartment block in Moscow.

'If you’re watching this...': Iranian records video urging Trump not to make a deal with Tehran before killing himself,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/if-youre-watching-this-iranian-records-video-urging-trump-not-to-make-a-deal-with-tehran-before-killing-himself/articleshow/128129917.cms,"



An Iranian man who recorded a video appeal to US President Donald Trump has taken his own life after urging him not to strike any deal with Iran’s current ruling establishment.Iranian media and activists identified the man as Pouria Hamidi, who was from the southern port city of Bushehr. In a video lasting around 10 minutes and recorded in English, Hamidi said he wanted to bring attention to a violent crackdown on protests in Iran.“If you’re watching this, then I’m not around anymore,” he said at the start of the recording. He claimed the video was meant to make people realise the massacre carried out by Iranian authorities during recent unrest.“More than 40,000 people died, killed, massacred. More than Russia and Ukraine war and more than Israel and Palestine,” Hamidi claimed, without providing evidence for the numbers, reports the Iran Insight.Addressing US leaders directly, he warned against negotiations with Tehran, saying any agreement would “betray all those people who died”.“So please,” he said, “I beg you, do whatever you can to stop this deal.”Hamidi also called for foreign intervention, saying diplomacy had failed. “America attacking the Iran is the only hope we have right now,” he said, adding, “We can't fight this regime alone. Our people need foreign intervention.”The video included criticism of Iran’s religious leadership and expressions of support for exiled Prince Reza Pahlavi. Hamidi said his message was an attempt to give meaning to his life and urged Iranians to support one another.At the end of the recording, he switched to Persian, saying: “We people of Iran are lonely people and have nobody, so please support each other. Long live Iran.”His death comes amid heightened tensions over Iran and the possibility of renewed negotiations with Tehran. Israel, in particular, has voiced concern over any deal that would preserve Iran’s ruling system.According to a report by Israel Hayom, Israeli officials fear that an agreement could leave the ayatollah regime in place, unlock frozen funds and fail to dismantle Iran’s nuclear and missile programmes. The report said Israel remains on high alert, viewing such a deal as potentially worse than a military confrontation.Israeli officials are expected to increase diplomatic and intelligence efforts to persuade Trump that there is a “historic window of opportunity” to curb Iran’s threat. These efforts are also expected to shape Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s planned meeting with Trump in Washington later this week.","Iranian media and activists identified the man as Pouria Hamidi, who was from the southern port city of Bushehr.
