Sibal eyes judge's impeachment, seeks PM's support

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday took note of a controversial speech by Allahabad high court judge Shekhar Kumar Yadav, in which he reportedly said the country would function as per the wishes of the ""bahusankhyak (majority)"" and expressed a term used to describe rigid clerics, which is considered pejorative by many. Amid protests that his remarks were unconstitutional and were aimed against the minority community, the apex court also sought a report from HC.The judge made the remarks while speaking on the Uniform Civil Code at a function organised by Vishwa Hindu Parishad on Sunday.As reports of his speech made headlines and a complaint was filed against him in the apex court, the SC administration headed by CJI Sanjiv Khanna sought details about the speech from HC.""SC has taken note of newspaper reports of a speech given by Justice Shekhar Kumar Yadav, a sitting judge of HC of judicature at Allahabad. The details and particulars have been called from HC and the matter is under consideration,"" stated a brief statement issued by the apex court.Meanwhile, NGO Campaign for Judicial Accountability and Reforms, whose patrons include retired SC judge P B Sawant, filed a complaint with CJI Khanna against the judge, seeking an in-house inquiry and suspension of his judicial work. A strong institutional response is needed as his speech creates doubts about the independence and neutrality of judiciary, it said.Senior advocate and Supreme Court Bar Association president Kapil Sibal appealed for the HC judge's impeachment and sought the support of the PM, home minister and BJP MPs to support the process of impeachment.In his speech, Justice Yadav reportedly said that the children of Hindus are always taught about being kind and non-violent, but such is not the case in the Muslim community. When there is one country and one Constitution, then why should not there be one law for all citizens, he said, supporting UCC.He said many bad practices, which were earlier prevalent among Hindus, such as Sati and female foeticide, have been done away with, and Muslims should also take steps to stop the practice of triple talaq and polygamy.Justice Yadav then said, ""I have no hesitation in saying that this is Hindustan, this country will function as per the wishes of the 'bahusankhyak (majority)' living in Hindustan. This is the law... You cannot say that you are saying this being a high court judge. The law works according to the majority, look at the functioning of family or society, it is the majority which decides.""In its complaint to the CJI, CJAR said, ""Such communally charged statements at a public event, by a sitting judge of HC, not only hurt religious sentiments, but completely erode faith of the general public in the integrity and impartiality of the judicial institution. Such a speech is also a brazen violation of his oath as a judge, where he had promised to uphold the Constitution and its values impartially.""","Allahabad high court judge Shekhar Kumar Yadav reportedly said the country would function as per the wishes of the ""bahusankhyak (majority)"" Yadav made the remarks while speaking on the Uniform Civil Code at a function organised by Vishwa Hindu Parishad.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116190499,imgsize-1008256,width-400,resizemode-4/116190499.jpg"

Bronson Reed: Bronson Reed and Tonga Loa OUT of WrestleMania 41? REPORTS,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/bronson-reed-and-tonga-loa-out-of-wrestlemania-41-reports/articleshow/116182383.cms,"Credits: WWE

Bronson Reed and Tanga Loa Skip WWE's Biggest Night

The road to WrestleMania 41 has taken a detour for two of the biggest WWE stars following a grueling WarGames match at Survivor Series left them out cold with serious injuries. Both up-and-coming powerhouse Bronson Reed and Bloodline member Tonga Loa are reportedly out for the foreseeable future, which shatters their dreams for WrestleMania in 2025.The Survivor Series WarGames match was always going to be an event full of high stakes and unforgettable moments as The OG Bloodline came up against Solo Sikoa's faction in an intense showdown. As tensions ran high, Solo Sikoa added Bronson Reed to his squad in a bold move, while the unexpected alliance of CM Punk and Roman Reigns electrified the WWE Universe. The turning point of the match came when Reed climbed the top of the cage to deliver a spectacular Tsunami splash to Roman Reigns, who was lying flat on a table. However, CM Punk, putting aside all personal rivalry, intervened at the last moment, so Reed missed his mark.Reed was gaining momentum and his participation in the WarGames match shows WWE believes in him. But his nonappearance at WrestleMania is a significant setback, and still, people hope he'll come back stronger for WrestleMania 42 . Reed's daring move has cost him the price. The powerhouse is reported to be undergoing surgery for a suspected broken ankle while attempting a cage dive and WWE has to reconsider its plans for the star. According to reports by Wrestling Observer Radio , the recovery time for Reed has put him out of WrestleMania 41, which would be a devastating blow to the star as he hasn't had a chance to debut on the biggest stage yet.Dave Meltzer stated: “I asked somebody there, and they said that he’s [Reed] not expected back for WrestleMania; it’s expected to be a long time.”Adding to the injury woes was the fact that Tonga Loa, another Bloodline faction mainstay, received a bad injury from his WarGames match. Very little is known about the nature of Loa's injuries; however, it may not be for WrestleMania 41, either.ALSO READ: Fans Opine on Axiom’s ‘Best Tag Team’ Statement: 'Your Partner is a MORON' The loss of two promising talents to the card is indeed a blow to the wrestling, but it's that drama and unpredictability with the recovery journey that keeps the fans intrigued. As WrestleMania 41 approaches, the creative of WWE faces the challenge of trying to reshape storylines in view of these injuries. Reed and Loa's absence opens the way for other superstars to move forward and ensure that the WrestleMania spectacle remains. Although Loa and Reed will be missed, as they say, the show must go on.","Bronson Reed and Tanga Loa are reportedly out for the foreseeable future.

'Writing on the wall': How Syrian teen Mouawiya Syasneh's 2011 graffiti led to Assad's downfall 13 years later,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/syrian-civil-war-how-teen-mouawiya-syasnehs-graffiti-in-2011-led-to-bashar-assads-downfall-13-years-later/articleshow/116159600.cms,"The Boy who started the Syrian War | Featured Documentary

The downfall of Syrian President Bashar Assad after the Syrian rebels took over the capital city of Damascus was already inked on a wall in 2011 by 14-year-old Mouawiya Syasneh's graffiti which said: ""Ejak el door, ya doctor"" (It's your turn, Doctor).“If we had known what would happen, we’d never have written that graffiti,” said Mouawiya Syasneh in The Boy Who Started The Syrian War, an Al Jazeera documentary.“We saw what was happening in Egypt and Tunisia,” he said and added, “So we got together at school, took some paint and sprayed the walls. We wrote on the school wall, ‘Your turn next, Doctor (Assad).’ A few days later the police saw what we’d written and rounded up the boys in the neighbourhood.”However, their act of defiance against Assad's regime was met with a swift and violent reaction. For 26 days, they were detained by the Mukhabarat, Syria's secret police, where they were reportedly tortured and mistreated. Their eventual release only fueled further anger among the people of Daraa.Recollecting the police torture, Syasneh said, “The electric shock treatment was the worst,” adding, “They took me to the bathroom and it was really wet and they would turn on the shower. They ran the current through the water and onto my back. I felt the shock wherever the water went.”Fearing for the boys' safety after a month in police custody, thousands of people took to the streets demanding their release. When the peaceful protests in Syria were met with more violence, they quickly escalated. What began as a call for the return of a few young boys transformed into a full-scale uprising.In the wake of Assad’s sudden departure, rebel leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, has sought to reassure Syrians that his group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), does not aim to dominate the country. He has emphasized the group's commitment to maintaining government services and establishing a decentralized governance system.For Assad's rule, the ""writing is on the wall"", Joshua Landis, of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma told AFP.As Assad fled, several government officials who remained in Damascus, including Prime Minister Mohammed Ghazi Jalali, have engaged in discussions with the rebels regarding the transfer of power.","14-year-old Mouawiya Syasneh's graffiti said: ""Ejak el door, ya doctor"" (It's your turn, Doctor).

INDORE: Singer Diljit Dosanjh dedicated his Sunday concert in Indore to Urdu poet Rahat Indori and recited his famous lines, ""Kisi ke baap ka Hindustan thode hi hai,"" evoking applause from a packed audience on December 8.Dosanjh’s rendition of Rahat Indori in his hometown is seen as a response to Bajrang Dal’s protest seeking a ban on his concert, alleging the 'use of liquor and meat' and raising concerns over the influence of the event on the city’s culture. Dosanjh did not mention Bajrang Dal during his gig.Bajrang Dal activists approached the police seeking a ban on Dosanjh’s concert, claiming that it intended to 'tarnish' culture by serving liquor and meat. “We have been campaigning against liquor, drugs, and the consumption of meat for the last two years. We told the police about Diljit Dosanjh’s concert, and the administration/police helped,” Bajrang Dal Indore Sambhag Sanyojak Praveen Darekar told TOI.A Bajrang Dal team visited the concert venue and claimed to have found two stalls with posters of liquor and an international fast-food brand known for its non-vegetarian food line-up. “Both were removed after our intervention,” Darekar said.But Dosanjh seemed to have an ace in his hand. He recited Rahat Indori’s lines: “Agar khilaaf hain.. hone do, Jaan thodi hai. Ye sab dhuan hai.. asmaan thodi hai. Sabhi ka khoon hai shaamil yahan ki mitti mein, kisi ke baap ka Hindustan thodi hai"" (If they oppose, let them; life is not at stake. This is just smoke, not the sky. Everybody’s blood (sacrifices) is mixed in this land’s soil, Hindustan is not anyone’s dad’s property).On Monday, Dosanjh wrote, with smileys, on a video post of the rendition on Instagram: “Love You Indore.. Baut Pyar.. Kal Ka Concert Rahat Indori Sahab Ke Naam Raha.. DIL-LUMINATI TOUR Year 24.”Rahat Indori, who passed away in August 2020, struck the hearts of the young audience with his poetry. The “Hindustan kisi ke baap ka nahin hai” was also used in several protests across India.Asked if Dosanjh intended to reply to Bajrang Dal’s opposition, Darekar said he may have become aware of the protest. “He is known to be involved in anti-national activities. He also extended funds to the farmers’ protest,” he said.",Diljit Dosanjh dedicated his Sunday concert in Indore to Urdu poet Rahat Indori.

The Floral Park fire department extinguished the flames and used special equipment, including a hydraulic lift, to remove the vehicle from the tracks.The Metropolitan Transportation Authority Police Department (MTAPD) responded to the scene and arrested Hidalgo on-site and took him into police custody. He was charged with first-degree reckless endangerment, third-degree criminal trespassing, and driving while intoxicated (DWI).The incident caused significant damage to the LIRR tracks, including the third rail, and halted train services on the Hempstead Branch, with delays on the Ronkonkoma, Port Jefferson, and Oyster Bay branches. Crews worked for three hours to remove the SUV, repair the tracks, and fully restore service.Efforts to clear the scene and restore service continued into the evening. The tracks were repaired by 8.40 pm (local time), and full service resumed.No injuries were reported, but commuters faced major disruptions due to the reckless act.Authorities, including the MTAPD and LIRR fire marshal, investigated how the SUV accessed the tracks.The MTA said the driver accessed the tracks just west of the Elmont UBS Arena Station from ground level, allowing the car to reach the tracks directly from land at the same elevation.Train riders were stunned that this could even happen.""This kind of thing is very embarrassing for like being late and things like that because it can cause delay and it's very dangerous,"" one LIRR rider said.""I think anything can happen, it's very weird. But it is unsettling no doubt. And if you're a passenger on the train? Yeah, what would you think about that?"" another rider said.","Basilio Hidalgo, 40, drove his SUV onto Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) tracks, igniting a fire and disrupting train services.

These were the last words that he spoke to them. He was hit by the speeding BEST bus at Kurla on Monday night. Gaikwad is survived by his wife Pramila, son Tushar and daughter Darshana, and grandchildren.His friend Shashikant Samekar said Gaikwad lived an active life and it was not unusual for him to be on a simple walk in the area where he lost his life.

'Transported in most secured way': Russia shares update on ousted Syrian President Assad,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/transported-in-most-secured-way-russia-shares-update-on-ousted-syrian-president-assad/articleshow/116195321.cms,"Bashar al-Assad , the ousted Syrian president , was transported to Russia under what has been described as “the most secure way possible” following the rapid collapse of his regime. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov , in an interview with NBC News on Tuesday confirmed that Assad fled to Russia.“He is secured, and it shows that Russia acts as required in such an extraordinary situation,” Ryabkov said. He refrained from divulging further details, adding that it “would be very wrong for me to elaborate on what happened and how it was resolved.”After Assad fled Syria his flight added an air of mystery to his escape. Early Sunday, reports emerged of a Syrian Air plane departing the capital’s airport under unclear circumstances. According to Flightradar24, the aircraft initially appeared to be heading toward Syria’s coastal region but abruptly changed course, flying in the opposite direction before vanishing from radar. This disappearance has sparked speculation, with some suggesting the plane’s transponder was deliberately switched off, while others believe the aircraft may have been downed.The Kremlin's decision to offer Assad asylum reflects Moscow’s long-standing alliance with Damascus, dating back to the Cold War.The former Syrian leader’s downfall came amid a lightning offensive by rebel forces that ended his family’s five-decade rule. With Damascus now under a transitional administration led by Mohammed al-Bashir, who has the backing of rebel groups, Assad’s flight signifies the abrupt conclusion of an era marked by widespread allegations of war crimes, including chemical attacks and systemic torture.The situation in Syria has also drawn Israel into the fray. Israeli defence minister Israel Katz confirmed a wave of airstrikes targeting military assets to prevent their capture by extremists. Israel also moved forces into a buffer zone along its border with Syria, though officials denied advancing towards Damascus. Katz stated that Israel's actions aimed to establish a “defence zone free of weapons and terrorist threats” in southern Syria, while reiterating that Israel would not tolerate a resurgence of extremism.Meanwhile, life in Damascus has begun to return to normal. Markets have reopened, and residents are adjusting to a new reality without Assad’s authoritarian grip. Maysoun Qurabi, a local shopper, expressed relief, saying, “Damascus is more beautiful now. It has a soul, and people feel at ease and secure.”","Bashar al-Assad was transported to Russia under what has been described as “the most secure way possible” following the rapid collapse of his regime.

'Like 2 different people': Ex-roommate of UnitedHealthcare CEO's killer Luigi Mangione speaks out,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/like-2-different-people-ex-roommate-of-unitedhealthcare-ceos-killer-luigi-mangione-speaks-out/articleshow/116194094.cms,"Luigi Mangione 's former roommate RJ Martin described the killer’s actions as completely at odds with the person he once knew, likening it to “two different people.”In an interview with Fox News, Martin reflected on his time with Mangione, an Ivy League graduate accused of murdering United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson. He recounted their close friendship and shared interests. “It feels strange because he was a great friend, and I considered him a close friend,” he said.“And that someone who would assassinate somebody is completely incompatible with the person I lived with—the person I cooked meals with, the person who was part of a book club and other activities with.”“It’s like two completely different human beings,” he added.In another interview with CNN, Martin said, “I can make zero sense of it.” He recalled Mangione as an active and thoughtful person, participating in activities like book clubs and hiking.Martin also said that Mangione did not appear to use drugs like ""magic mushrooms"" and had recently undergone surgery for severe back pain, which had limited his ability to stay active. “Sometimes Mangione went ‘radio silent’ while recovering from his back surgery,” he noted. Despite this, when pain-free, Mangione remained involved in workouts, volleyball, and yoga classes, which helped the two bond.Mangione reportedly had even shared an X-ray on social media, revealing his spinal issues. According to Martin, the condition had troubled him for a long time and was a factor in his decision to return home for medical care.Others who worked with Mangione during his academic years shared similar sentiments. A former colleague from a Stanford summer program described him as socially adept and outgoing. “I never got the impression he would self-destruct,” the colleague told CNN.The 26-year-old Mangione was arrested on Monday at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, following a tip from a customer. He faces charges including murder, weapon possession, and forgery.Authorities allege that Mangione shot and killed Thompson, 50, while the CEO was on his way to an investors' meeting at a New York City hotel last Wednesday. Bullet casings found at the scene were engraved with the words “deny,” “defend,” and “depose,” a phrase that mirrors language often used by critics of the insurance industry, according to the NYPD.Meanwhile, as he was brought to the extradition hearing on Monday, Luigi Mangione shouted at the media waiting outside the courtroom. “It’s extremely out of touch and an insult to the intelligence of the American people and their lived experience,” he said as he was led into a Pennsylvania courthouse. Dressed in an orange prison jumpsuit, Mangione was seen screaming.","Luigi Mangione's former roommate RJ Martin described the killer's actions as completely at odds with the person he once knew.

What Trump said on Syria

President-elect Donald Trump's pick for intelligence chief Tulsi Gabbard ignored a question about Bashar al-Assad in the background of the collapse of his rule in Syria and said she supports what Trump said about Syria. “I want to address the issue that’s in the headlines right now: I stand in full support and wholeheartedly agree with the statements that President Trump has made over these last few days with regards to the developments in Syria,” Gabbard said exiting a Senate meeting, without mentioning Assad. She said her views were shaped by her multiple deployments and seeing firsthand the cost of war and the threat of Islamist terrorism.""It's one of the many reasons why I appreciate President Trump’s leadership and his election, where he is fully committed, as he has said over and over, to bring about an end to wars.""In 2017, Tulsi Gabbard went to Syria and met Assad when the US already severed diplomatic relations with Syria. Gabbard, then a Democrat leader, defended her trip and said it was important to open dialogue.Tulsi Gabbard is one of the controversial picks of Trump awaiting Senate confirmation before becoming the intelligence chief. Last week, nearly 100 former officials who served in both Democratic and Republican administrations wrote a letter to Senate leaders that they were alarmed by the choice of Gabbard who will oversee all 18 US intelligence agencies.

Broader Implications



A resurfaced video featuring US Representative Nancy Mace engaging in a suggestive act with another woman has sparked controversy, particularly in light of her recent legislative actions targeting transgender individuals' access to bathrooms.The video, reportedly from 2017, shows Mace participating in a drinking game where she and another woman engage in an act known as "" baby birding ."" This practice involves passing a shot of liquor mouth-to-mouth, often seen as intimate or provocative. At the time, the video drew criticism for being inappropriate, and its recent reemergence has reignited discussions about her personal conduct and political stance.Recently, Mace introduced a resolution to restrict access to single-sex facilities in federal spaces, including within the US Capitol, based on individuals' sex assigned at birth. This proposal was widely viewed as targeting a newly elected transgender lawmaker and has fueled national debates about bathroom access and gender identity.Expanding on this, Mace proposed legislation to impose similar restrictions across all federal properties, mandating that individuals use restrooms corresponding to their biological sex. Exceptions were included for emergency responders and law enforcement. The legislation has drawn both support and criticism, with arguments centering on privacy, safety, and inclusivity.The resurfaced video has led to accusations of hypocrisy, with critics pointing to the contrast between Mace's participation in the provocative act and her vocal stance against transgender individuals accessing facilities that align with their gender identity. Many argue that the video undermines her credibility as a defender of privacy and women’s spaces.Mace’s supporters, however, contend that the video is irrelevant to her legislative agenda. They dismiss it as an attempt to distract from the substantive issues her proposals aim to address, arguing that her past personal behavior has no bearing on her commitment to protecting single-sex spaces.""Baby birding"" refers to the act of transferring food or drink from one person’s mouth to another’s, mimicking the way some birds feed their young. In social settings, it often involves passing a shot of alcohol in a drinking game, typically seen as provocative due to the close physical contact and exchange of saliva involved.The resurfacing of the 2017 video highlights the tension between personal history and public policy. Critics have questioned whether Mace’s actions in the video align with the values she champions through her legislative efforts. Meanwhile, her supporters argue that the incident is being used to unfairly discredit her. This juxtaposition of past conduct with current political actions has sparked broader debates about consistency, privacy, and the motivations behind such legislation.

What is the Luigi Mangione '286 Conspiracy Theory'?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-the-luigi-mangione-286-conspiracy-theory/articleshow/116176938.cms,"The Case: The Murder of Brian Thompson



Details of the Crime



Mangione’s Arrest



Key Connections to the Number 286







Timeline of Events



The ""286 conspiracy theory"" centers on the alleged connections between Luigi Mangione—a suspect in the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson—and the number 286. Internet sleuths have identified several supposed links between this number and various aspects of Mangione’s life, actions, and the murder, fueling speculation about deeper meanings or intentions.On December 7, 2024, Brian Thompson, CEO of UnitedHealthcare, was fatally shot outside a Hilton hotel in Midtown Manhattan. Surveillance footage captured a masked gunman fleeing the scene, described by witnesses as wearing dark clothing and carrying a concealed weapon. The attack occurred at approximately 9:15 PM as Thompson exited a private dinner event. The gunman fired multiple shots, striking Thompson in the chest and abdomen. Despite immediate emergency response, Thompson was pronounced dead upon arrival at a nearby hospital.Thompson was a significant figure in the corporate healthcare industry, known for leading cost-cutting measures and streamlining insurance policies. While these efforts were celebrated by some in the corporate world, they also attracted criticism from activists and patients who felt neglected by the healthcare system.The weapon used in the murder was a ghost gun, an untraceable firearm assembled from unregulated parts. This type of weapon, favored by those seeking to avoid detection, was later discovered among Mangione’s possessions. Witness accounts and surveillance footage showed the suspect fleeing north on foot in a calculated manner, leading authorities to believe the crime was premeditated. Investigators connected Mangione to the murder using ballistic evidence, digital footprints, and his documented animosity toward the corporate healthcare sector.Two days after the murder, on December 9, 2024, Mangione was arrested at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania. He was found in possession of a ghost gun similar to the one used in the murder, a three-page handwritten manifesto detailing his grievances against corporate America, and forged identification documents. Investigators determined that Mangione had fled Manhattan immediately after the crime, using cash and burner phones to evade capture.The number 286 has emerged as a recurring element in the investigation, with internet sleuths drawing various connections. One notable link is the Pokémon Breloom, which holds the Pokédex number 286. This Pokémon featured prominently in Mangione’s X (formerly Twitter) account banner, leading some to speculate that it was chosen intentionally.Some have tied the number to Proverbs 28:6, a Bible verse stating, “Better is a poor man who walks in his integrity than a rich man who is crooked in his ways.” This verse has been interpreted as reflective of Mangione’s disdain for corporate greed and figures like Thompson. Furthermore, in healthcare billing, denial code 286 refers to claims denied due to failure to meet appeal deadlines—a symbolic connection given Mangione’s documented criticism of the healthcare system.On December 7, 2024, Brian Thompson was fatally shot outside the Hilton hotel in Manhattan. Surveillance footage captured the gunman fleeing the scene. The following day, police identified Mangione as a person of interest based on digital evidence and previous anti-corporate statements. On December 9, Mangione was arrested in Altoona, Pennsylvania, where he was charged with weapons possession and forgery. Authorities began preparing murder charges based on ballistic evidence and Mangione’s manifesto. On December 10, Mangione appeared in court, and prosecutors revealed his potential motivations and ties to the healthcare industry.The Luigi Mangione ""286 conspiracy theory"" hinges on the idea that a single number ties together various elements of a murder case, reflecting either deliberate symbolism or an unusual string of coincidences. While the significance of 286 remains speculative, the case has captivated public interest, demonstrating how patterns—real or imagined—can influence the narratives of high-profile investigations.","The ""286 conspiracy theory"" centers on the alleged connections between Luigi Mangione and the number 286.

Bettina Anderson shared this cryptic birthday wish that she probably received from Don Jr.

The rumor mills that Donald Trump Jr was seeing Palm Beach socialite Bettina Anderson dumping his fiancee Kimberly Guilfoyle are again working overtime after Bettina was seen hand in hand with Donald Trump Jr on her birthday Monday. More than their joint appearance, what intrigued people was Bettina Anderson's Instagram story where she posted a birthday message which probably came from Donald Trump Jr.""Many have said you're aging out but I think you're perfect...Happy birthday!"" the message said. ""Tough but fair,"" Bettina wrote. On the left corner of the message, the Instagram account of Donald Trump Jr was tagged in an almost illegible form.DailyMail snapped Don Jr and Anderson together at a cafe in West Palm Beach where they were celebrating Anderson's birthday. The report said Don Jr spends most of his time now at Anderson's townhome in West Palm Beach and not at the Florida mansion that he and Kimberly Guilfoyle bought together after their engagement in December 2020.Just before the election, Florida socialite Bettina Anderson was in the news as the new love interest of Donald Trump Jr. Speculations were rife that Don Jr would break off his engagement with Guilfoyle for Anderson. But both of them co-existed and even after Don Jr spending much of his time with Bettina, he and Kimberly Guilfoyle are also seen together.Like Don Jr, Guilfoyle played a crucial role in Donald Trump's campaign this time and both of them are still working for the same. Guilfoyle, for example, wrote an opinion piece in the Washington Post on Trump's FBI chief pick Kash Patel: 'Patel is highly qualified to lead the FBI'.""Without Mr. Patel, we never would have unraveled the Russia hoax, or learned the dirty details about the Clinton-funded Steele dossier or just how flawed the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Court system is.

Vice president Kamala Harris' presidential campaign finances have come under radar following reports that her campaign made substantial payments to Beyoncé's production company, Parkwood Production Media LLC , according to records from the US Federal Election Commission accessed by USA Today.The USA Today report highlighted a $165,000 payment to Parkwood Production Media LLC on November 19, a month after Harris and Beyoncé appeared together at an event in the singer’s hometown of Houston. The company, better known publicly as Parkwood Entertainment, is Beyoncé's management, production, and record label, founded in 2008.Additionally, Harris' campaign paid $1 million to Harpo Productions, Oprah Winfrey's company, in October. Federal records show two payments of $500,000 each on October 15. Winfrey addressed the matter in an Instagram video, stating, “I did not take any personal fee. However, the people who worked on that production needed to be paid. And were. End of story.”The vice president's campaign earlier had denied providing a fee for celebrity endorsements. ""We do not pay. We have never paid any artist and performer,"" Adrienne Elrod , who held the position of senior adviser and senior spokesperson was quoted as saying to New York Post.These substantial expenditures by Harris' campaign have sparked significant criticism and raised questions about the value and effectiveness of high-profile endorsements and events, as noted by USA Today. Despite her campaign’s considerable fundraising success, Kamala Harris ultimately lost the U.S. presidential election to Republican candidate Donald Trump. The loss marked a notable defeat, especially for a candidate with such a significant financial advantage.The report said between October 25 and November 25, the Harris campaign raised $160 million and spent $277 million. In comparison, the Trump campaign raised $87 million and spent $113 million during the same period. Both campaigns allocated the largest portion of their expenditures to media purchases, including television, online ads, and ad production, aiming to maximize voter outreach in the final days of the election. However, federal filings from the Democratic nominee’s campaign reveal a range of additional expenses, which are likely to spark post-election analysis of how Harris' campaign spent over $1 billion but still lost to Trump.","Kamala Harris' presidential campaign finances have come under radar following reports that her campaign made substantial payments to Beyoncé's production company.

(AP)

US President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday selected Federal Trade Commissioner Andrew Ferguson to lead the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), signaling a potential shift in the agency's priorities toward addressing perceived censorship of conservative viewpoints online.Ferguson has emphasized the need for strict antitrust enforcement against social media platforms and advertisers collaborating to suppress viewpoints. “We must vigorously enforce the antitrust laws against any platforms found to be unlawfully limiting Americans' ability to exchange ideas freely and openly,” Ferguson said recently.The appointment follows a contentious period under outgoing FTC Chair Lina Khan , who prioritized aggressive antitrust enforcement, particularly against Big Tech . While some Republicans, including incoming Vice President JD Vance, supported Khan's approach, critics argued it overstepped the agency's authority.Ferguson will inherit several ongoing cases, including antitrust lawsuits against Amazon, Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook), and Microsoft. Key cases include Amazon’s alleged efforts to dominate online marketplaces and Meta’s acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp, which the FTC aims to unwind. However, a judge has expressed skepticism about the FTC's chances of success in the Meta case, set for trial in April.The FTC's future direction under Ferguson remains uncertain, particularly with probes into Microsoft’s cloud services and OpenAI’s privacy practices still pending. Observers expect his tenure to bring significant shifts, especially in enforcing antitrust laws to address ideological censorship concerns.","US President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday selected Federal Trade Commissioner Andrew Ferguson to lead the Federal Trade Commission.

The arrest of Luigi Mangione , a 26-year-old Ivy League graduate accused of fatally shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson , has left his family and friends reeling.Mangione, who was apprehended on Monday at a McDonald’s in Pennsylvania, is facing charges of second-degree murder and multiple weapon offences. The incident, which occurred outside a Midtown Manhattan hotel last Friday, has drawn widespread shock and confusion among those who knew him.“Our family is shocked and devastated by Luigi’s arrest,” Mangione’s family said in a statement, reported ABC News. “We offer our prayers to the family of Brian Thompson and ask people to pray for all involved”, the statement added.Luigi Mangione’s classmates and former associates have described him as a brilliant and approachable individual, making the allegations against him all the more surprising.Freddie Leatherbury, a former classmate from the Gilman School, remembered him as humble despite being named valedictorian in 2016. “He wasn’t snobby, he was unassuming and easy to approach,”Leatherbury.RJ Martin, who lived with Mangione in a communal space in Hawaii, said the news was incomprehensible. “I can make zero sense of it,” Martin told. He recalled Mangione as an active and thoughtful person, participating in activities like book clubs and hiking.Others who worked with Mangione during his academic years shared similar sentiments. A former colleague from a Stanford summer programme described him as socially adept and outgoing. “I never got the impression he would self-destruct,” the colleague toldAmong the reactions to Luigi Mangione's arrest was a deeply emotional tribute from his friend Tracy Le, shared on Instagram just hours after his name was revealed in connection with the case.“When I first saw the news, I was hoping it was just either a common name or a mistake,” Le wrote, highlighting the disbelief she felt.As per the Sun, she described Mangione as one of her ""best, closest, and most trusted friends,"" recalling their close bond.Le shared that Mangione had been a significant presence in her life, the go-to person for her “identity crisis rants, relationship problems, career complaints,” always offering comfort and leaving her feeling better. “He was caring, and smart, and mature, and sweet, and so considerate,” she noted.Reflecting on their time together, Le recalled how she had always relied on him to plan trips and trusted his ability to make their time memorable. “I am shaken, I am blindsided, but most of all, I am sad. I am heartbroken. I am overwhelmed,” she concluded in her tributeAlthough Mangione was known for his social media activity, his sudden silence in recent months raised concerns among friends.On Goodreads, where he had shared reviews of hundreds of books, including a positive review of the Unabomber manifesto, his absence was noticed.Earlier this year, a user on X expressed concern, writing, “Nobody has heard from you in months, and apparently your family is looking for you.”When Mangione was arrested, police found a backpack containing a 3D-printed pistol , silencer, and a note criticising corporate America. Investigators believe the attack was premeditated and targeted.The Mangione family, known for their community involvement, expressed their grief and called for prayers during this difficult time. Meanwhile, friends are left grappling with the stark contrast between the person they knew and the allegations now facing him.","Luigi Mangione, 26, is accused of fatally shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.

As the suspected killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was brought for the extradition hearing, Luigi Mangione shouted at the media waiting outside the courtroom. ""It's extremely out of touch and an insult to the intelligence of the American people and the lived experience,"" he said as he was led into a Pennsylvania courthouse. Dressed in an orange prison jumpsuit, Luigi was seen screaming to send out his message. He will have to be transferred to New York City where he coldbloodedly shot Thompson dead.The 26-year-old comes from a wealthy family with political connections as well. But Mangione left the luxury of his family house and started staying in a co-living space in Hawaii. While his former friends, and roommates can't imagine him emerging as a killer as Mangione is a very well-read, well-educated person, his back injury, they said, changed him as a person. It's not clear whether his spinal surgery had anything to do with UnitedHealthcare, but his social media history shows he read a lot about back pain.In a hand-written note found on him during the time of arrest, Mangione compared UnitedHealthcare to a magia accusing the country's largest private insurer of putting its profits above the care of its clients. He wrote that US has the ""most expensive healthcare system in the world"" but ranks 42 in life expectancy"". The note showed how he considered himself as a hero who had to take the action to stop such kind of injustices. “Evidently I am the first to face it with such brutal honesty,” Mangione wrote. Brian Thompson's murder was a ""symbolic takedown"" and a ""direct challenge"" to the health care company's coruup[tion and power games, his note revealed.In the new arrest warrant, five charges were imposed against Mangione -- three counts of criminal possession of a weapon and criminal possession of a forged instrument.","Luigi Mangione, 26, is accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's former Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), has been formally indicted on a number of charges, including engaging in political activities and violating a law on official secrets, during field general court martial (FGCM) proceedings against him, military's media affairs wing said Tuesday.Army's media arm ISPR said FGCM also charged Hameed with compromising state security and interests, abusing authority and resources and causing undue harm to individuals. ISPR said proceedings against Hameed were initiated on Aug 12 under provisions of Pakistan Army Act.Hameed, who served as ISI director-general from June 2019 to Oct 2021, was taken into custody from Rawalpindi four months ago when he was summoned to a meeting by a senior military officer. He was arrested over accusations about his involvement in land grabbing and snatching valuables and property from the owner of a private housing society. His arrest busted the myth that ISI chiefs were untouchable in a country where powerful generals have long wielded unparalleled influence in state affairs.""During the process, involvement of Lt Gen Faiz Hamid (Retd) in events related to creating agitation and unrest, leading up to multiple incidents including but not limited to the May 9, 2023 incident for fomenting instability, at the behest of and in collusion with vested political interests, is also being separately investigated,"" ISPR said. The May 9 incident referred to countrywide protests when PTI supporters stormed army installations and govt buildings following the arrest of party chief and ex-PM Imran Khan for alleged graft. To many, Hameed's close association with Khan was the reason behind his arrest. Khan wanted to continue with Hameed as ISI head but then army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa had been adamant on replacing him. Bajwa eventually succeeded and Khan could serve only a few months in office; he was later removed through a no-confidence.Independent observers say action against Hameed could put Khan under pressure and pave the way for the ex-PM to face a military court on charges of treason and attempting to incite mutiny in the military.","Pakistan's former Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), has been formally indicted on a number of charges.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan ’s imprisoned ex-prime minister Imran Khan has threatened to launch a nationwide civil disobedience movement, in an apparent bid to keep his public mobilisation campaign intact and to force the country’s powerful authorities to agree to his demands.Less than two weeks after his “final call” protest in Islamabad was violently suppressed, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief has asked his supporters to converge on Dec 13 in the northwestern city of Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, to pay homage to party workers who were killed in the crackdown by security forces in Islamabad.His call for protest in Islamabad had mobilised thousands of supporters, primarily from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a province governed by his party. Imran’s party is believed to have organised the Dec 13 gathering in Peshawar keeping in mind his popularity in the region.Imran has also constituted a five-member team to discuss two key demands with govt: release of undertrial prisoners and a judicial probe into the crackdown on the Nov 26 protest march and the violence on May 9 last year. On both dates, PTI workers and Imran’s supporters held major protests, but faced a backlash from govt and security forces.“If these two demands are not accepted, a civil disobedience movement will begin on Dec 14. Govt will bear full responsibility for the consequences,” the PTI chief’s post in Urdu read.“As part of the movement, we will urge overseas Pakistanis to limit remittances and start a boycott campaign. In the second phase, we will escalate our actions further,” he added.The announcement followed Imran’s recent indictment for his involvement in an attack on military headquarters on May 9 last year, while he was also slapped with charges of terrorism for his role in protests that besieged Islamabad last month.Meanwhile, data submitted before the Islamabad high court revealed that the 72-year old cricketer-turned-politician is currently facing 188 criminal cases and inquiries.

Growing threat from Baloch separatists

Sectarian violence fuels instability

Border tensions and counterterrorism efforts

What lies ahead

Pakistan witnessed a sharp rise in terror attacks in November, with 61 incidents marking a 27% increase from the previous month, according to a report by the Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS). The number of fatalities also surged by 69%, climbing from 100 in October to 169, with 225 others injured.The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a banned group, carried out 12 attacks in November, including three high-impact incidents that resulted in 45 deaths. These figures surpassed the fatalities caused by the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), indicating a shift in the BLA's operational strategy. Experts suggest this escalation requires a reassessment of counterterrorism tactics.The majority of these attacks in Balochistan targeted security forces and civilians. Notable incidents included an assault on the Quetta railway station, an attack on a police van in Mastung, and a strike on a security check-post in Kalat, which collectively accounted for 91% of the province’s fatalities.Sectarian violence added another layer to the country's security challenges, particularly in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). Seven incidents, including two terror attacks and five sectarian clashes, claimed 115 lives and left 137 injured. The violence was triggered by an attack on passenger buses on November 21, which spiraled into broader sectarian unrest.KP remained the most affected province, with 41 terrorist attacks leading to 114 deaths and 95 injuries. The TTP, Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, Lashkar-i-Islam, and other local factions were linked to most of these incidents.The report also highlighted six incidents of border violence along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, resulting in 25 terrorist deaths and 11 injuries. This underscores the ongoing instability in the region and the challenges posed by cross-border insurgents.Security forces conducted 19 counterterrorism operations in November, killing 53 terrorists. Most of these operations were concentrated in KP and Balochistan, the epicenters of recent violence.The PIPS report paints a grim picture of Pakistan's security landscape, with 98 conflict-related incidents causing 338 deaths and 411 injuries in November alone. Experts suggest that the evolving nature of terror threats, including the increasing lethality of BLA operations and persistent sectarian tensions, requires urgent and innovative policy responses.As Pakistan grapples with these challenges, the question remains: can the state adapt quickly enough to address the multifaceted threats destabilizing the country?","Pakistan witnessed a sharp rise in terror attacks in November, with 61 incidents marking a 27% increase from the previous month.

In a virtual address to a gathering of overseas Awami League supporters in London on Sunday, Hasina accused Yunus of being the ""mastermind"" behind the July-August turmoil that ousted her government and vowed to bring him and his allies to justice under Bangladeshi law.She criticized Yunus and his interim government for their alleged persecution of religious minorities in Bangladesh.""Since August 5, the attacks on minorities, places of worship of Hindus, Christians and Buddhists have been rampant. We condemn it. The Jamaat and terrorists are having a free run under the new regime,"" she said.The audio recording of Hasina's address was shared on the Facebook page of the Bangladesh Students' League and Bangladesh Awami League.Her remarks came ahead of Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri's visit to Dhaka Monday where he raised India's concerns over the safety of minorities, flagging ""regrettable incidents of attacks on cultural, religious and diplomatic properties"" in the country.There have been a spate of incidents of violence against Hindus and other minorities, as well as attacks on temples in Bangladesh in the last few weeks that triggered strong concerns in New Delhi.""Bangladesh is now under the grip of a fascist regime where people's democratic rights have been obliterated. Our government's achievements in poverty alleviation and infrastructure development, strengthening of democracy were being undone under Yunus's leadership,"" Hasina said during her 37-minute virtual address over the phone.Hasina accused the Yunus government of providing clemency to terrorists and criminals, including those involved in arson and murders.""The release of convicted criminals and terrorists, including those responsible for attacks on the Bangladesh Parliament and other atrocities, proves the complicity of this government,"" she alleged.Hasina vowed that those responsible for the alleged atrocities under the Yunus administration would be brought to justice.""Md Yunus and his allies are the masterminds of the July-August unrest in the country. They are behind the killing of students and policemen, arson and atrocities. The murderers and conspirators who have harmed our nation will be held accountable under Bangladeshi law.

This government is using every tool to suppress dissent and deny justice,"" she said.Chinmay Krishna Das, a prominent spokesperson for Bangladesh Sammilita Sanatani Jagran Jote, was arrested at Dhaka's Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on Monday while en route to Chattogram for a rally. He was denied bail and remanded to jail on Tuesday. His arrest has further fueled concerns over the treatment of Hindus in Bangladesh.Condemning the ongoing oppression, Hasina declared, ""This dark chapter of our nation's history will not last forever. Mohammed Yunus will be held accountable for his actions, and justice will prevail.""Hasina further alleged that people are being subjected to brutal violence.""Innocent people have been beaten to death under this fascist regime. The rule of law has been completely eroded,"" she said, calling for accountability and justice.Hasina claimed that the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) has ignored allegations of financial irregularities involving Yunus and his organization, Grameen Bank.""They accuse my government of corruption but fail to provide evidence. Meanwhile, Yunus's activities remain unchecked by the ACC,"" she said, reiterating her challenge for the interim government to substantiate its allegations against her.Hasina claimed that since August, more than a thousand leaders and workers of the Awami League have been killed, their homes looted, and their businesses destroyed.She claimed that members of her party were being systematically targeted and that these incidents were part of a broader conspiracy to eliminate the Awami League's influence.""All units of the Awami League have been subjected to attacks. The homes and businesses of our leaders have been looted.

A criminology student, Nasen Saadi, is facing trial for the murder of Amie Gray and the attempted murder of Leanne Miles on a Bournemouth beach in May.Saadi, 20, allegedly murdered Gray, 34, and injured Miles, 38, as they sat on the sand.He has pleaded not guilty to the charges but admitted to obstructing the police by failing to provide access to his mobile phone. The court has heard how Saadi had spent months planning the attack, researching beaches and weapons, and even expressing a desire to know what it felt like to take a life.According to BBC reports, Saadi’s criminology lecturer, Dr Lisa-Maria Reiss, recalled that he asked her about the consequences of murder and self-defence, though these topics were not part of the lesson.When questioned by her, he claimed he was writing an article. However, the questioning continued, with Saadi asking other lecturers about police procedures, DNA evidence, and how to avoid detection after committing a crime.According to the Guardian, Prison officer Benjamin Raffo, during a welfare assessment after Saadi’s arrest, reported that Saadi admitted to being fascinated by knives and had a collection of them at home. The defendant allegedly told Raffo he liked the ""shape and look"" of knives and had around six in his possession.Saadi’s comments about his phone also raised concerns, as he claimed to have an alphanumeric password, believing it would be harder to crack, showing a level of premeditation.The attack occurred on May 24, 2023, when Saadi allegedly approached the two women as they watched the full moon by a fire. Gray died from her injuries, while Miles managed to survive but suffered multiple stab wounds.In a video played in court, Miles tearfully described how she begged for her life for the sake of her children, only for the defendant to continue attacking her.The court also heard how Saadi had been researching deadly weapons, booking a hotel near Bournemouth days before the attack, and watching a film about a killer with no motive.His actions appear to confirm prosecutors’ claims that he killed to satisfy his curiosity about what it felt like to take a life, as Sarah Jones KC, prosecuting, stated: ""He seems to have wanted to know what it would be like to take life.""","Nasen Saadi, 20, is facing trial for the murder of Amie Gray and the attempted murder of Leanne Miles on a Bournemouth beach in May.

"UK monk sexually abused children on island for several decades, finds report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-monk-sexually-abused-children-on-island-for-several-decades-finds-report/articleshow/116181406.cms,"Thaddeus Kotik. (Photo credit: X/@SwiadomyWodnik)

The head of a monastic abbey on Caldey Island in Wales, UK, apologized on Tuesday following a review that found a monk, Father Thaddeus Kotik , sexually abused children over several decades. The abuse occurred ""in plain sight"" despite multiple complaints being raised.The review found that victims from the 1970s described Kotik, who died in 1992, as a ""serial and prolific"" abuser. Caldey Island is home to Cistercian Order monks and is a tourist destination.The island promotes itself as a peaceful religious site and is described as ""one of Britain's holy islands"" on its website.Victims alleged Kotik used sweets, chocolate, and a tortoise to lure children to secluded areas. He reportedly gained access to children by befriending families on the island, offering gifts, affection, and babysitting services.Father Jan Rossey, the current abbot of Caldey Abbey, apologized for a ""closed culture of secrecy and cover-up"" that allowed the abuse to continue. He said, ""It is clear opportunities were missed to stop the abuse of children. It is particularly heartbreaking to hear children spoke up to adults and no action was taken.""Kotik died in 1992 without being charged or convicted. Allegations of abuse became public in 2017 when six women filed a legal claim alleging Kotik sexually abused them between 1971 and 1987. This claim was settled financially, but the abbey did not apologize at the time.An independent review was initiated earlier this year after a victims’ campaign group reported that around 50 people had come forward with allegations of abuse by monks on the island.The review looked into allegations from people who lived on or visited the island as children. These accounts included incidents of inappropriate touching and, in one case, rape. The review noted a ""failure of leadership"" within the Order and Abbey, stating that allegations were not reported to authorities, as required by law at the time.Father Rossey pledged to improve transparency and implement safeguarding measures on the island.","Father Jan Rossey, the current abbot of Caldey Abbey, apologized for a ""closed culture of secrecy and cover-up"" that allowed the abuse to continue.
