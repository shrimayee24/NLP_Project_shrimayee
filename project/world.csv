NEW DELHI: The Indian Army foiled an infiltration attempt along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir’s Baramulla district on Wednesday, eliminating two terrorists in an ongoing operation near Uri, a day after the Pahalgam terror attack that left 28 tourists dead.According to the Chinar Corps, 2–3 unidentified terrorists tried to infiltrate through the general area of Sarjeevan at Uri Nala on April 23. Alert troops challenged the infiltrators, leading to a heavy exchange of fire. Later on, the Corps confirmed the elimination of two terrorists.“Heavy exchange of fire between security forces and terrorists, two terrorists have been eliminated… large quantity of weapons, ammunition and other war-like stores have been recovered. Operation is in progress,” it posted.This infiltration attempt came a day after the deadly terrorist attack on tourists in Pahalgam, which killed at least 28 tourists and left many others wounded. The attack, claimed by The Resistance Front, which is an offshoot of the ISI-backed Lashkar-e-Taiba, marked the deadliest assault since the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019.It also came during US Vice President JD Vance’s India visit and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s trip to Saudi Arabia. PM Modi returned to Delhi early Wednesday, cutting short his trip following the attack. He immediately held a high-level briefing at Palam Airport with external affairs minister S Jaishankar, NSA Ajit Doval, foreign secretary Vikram Misri and other top officials.The Prime Minister skipped an official dinner hosted in Riyadh and returned nearly a full day early. PM Modi had earlier condemned the Pahalgam attack, assuring the nation that those responsible would be held accountable. “They will not be spared,” he said, reaffirming India’s unwavering resolve against terrorism.Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman also returned early from her official visit to the US and Peru following the attack.Meanwhile, a joint operation by the Army and J&K Police is underway in Pahalgam’s Baisran area to track down the perpetrators.

This isn't just an attack on a select few--it is an attack on all of us. We stand together in grief and outrage & strongly support this shutdown to condemn the massacre of innocents,"" Mufti posted on X.Following the attacks, a wave of fear and uncertainty has gripped tourists as many of them vacated hotels in Srinagar, Anantnag and Gulmarg.Chandrakant Kale, an IMD official from Pune, had just left Pahalgam with his wife moments before the attack. “We came to know about it while we were on the way to Srinagar. I felt totally shaken,” Kale said over the phone.Pune-based lawyer Vijaysinh Thombare, currently in Srinagar with his wife NCP neta Rupali Patil-Thombare, said tourists are alarmed and eager to leave. “Most of us are scared and want to leave J&K as soon as possible,” he said.“We were at Pahalgam Sunday, then moved to Gulmarg the following day.

Speaking to ANI, he recalled the sheer panic that unfolded as they heard gunfire ring out behind them, just moments after they had left the site of the attack.""This incident happened when we had just left the place of the incident. We could hear the sound of firing for a long time. We didn’t look back. Everyone was screaming, trying to get out. The exit gate was just four feet wide, and there were too many people.

From her hospital bed, she remembered the confusion, ""People shouted, ‘firing ho rahi hai!’ We just ran. Children were crying, people were pushing, there was no space.”Eyewitnesses described the scene of horror. Waheed, a local tour guide, told AFP he rushed to help after hearing the gunshots. “I saw men lying on the ground — lifeless. I helped carry the wounded on horseback,” he said.Pahalgam, located about 90 kilometres from Srinagar, has long been a tourist favourite. This brazen attack has left the region and the nation shaken. Chief minister Omar Abdullah called it “much larger than anything we’ve seen directed at civilians in recent years,” and condemned the attackers as “inhuman.”Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who returned from Saudi Arabia after cutting short the trip, called the attack a “heinous act” and promised justice. He directed home minister Amit Shah to visit the site.

NEW DELHI: Terror struck at the heart of Kashmir’s tourist belt once again on Tuesday, as militants opened fire on a crowded site in Pahalgam, killing at least 28 people, including two foreign nationals from the UAE and Nepal, and two locals. The incident, which also left dozens injured, has reignited memories of the valley’s most brutal attacks on civilians over the past three decades.The assault, carried out at one of south Kashmir’s most visited locations, comes just months after the deadly June 2024 attack in Reasi, where pilgrims en route to Vaishno Devi were targeted. Officials described Tuesday’s attack as the deadliest on civilians in recent years.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who landed in Delhi shortly after the attack, held an emergency meeting with NSA Ajit Doval and external affairs minister S Jaishankar at the airport itself. Meanwhile, Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah called the attack “much larger than anything we've seen directed at civilians in recent years.”Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi said he had spoken with home minister Amit Shah, the J&K chief minister, and Congress leader Tariq Karra to understand the situation. ""The families of the victims deserve justice and our fullest support. Hollow claims of normalcy must now give way to concrete action,” Gandhi said.This is not the first time Pahalgam has found itself in the crosshairs. From the abduction of six foreign tourists in 1995, one of whom was later killed, to the 2000 Nunwan base camp massacre that left 32 dead, including Amarnath pilgrims and local vendors, the region has seen more than its share of bloodshed.The valley’s history is pockmarked with chilling incidents:, 36 Sikhs were massacred in Chittisinghpora on the eve of President Clinton’s visit.9 Amarnath pilgrims were killed in an attack at the Nunwan camp., seven Amarnath pilgrims, mostly from Gujarat, were killed in Anantnag., a Vaishno Devi-bound bus came under fire in Reasi, killing 10 and injuring 33.From fidayeen assaults on temples to grenade attacks on buses, the targets have mostly remained the same: pilgrims, tourists, migrant workers, and minority communities.As the nation mourns yet another tragedy, pressure is mounting on the Centre and state administration to move beyond statements and deliver actionable security reforms.","Militants opened fire on a crowded site in Pahalgam, killing at least 28 people, including two foreign nationals from the UAE and Nepal, and two locals.

These non-locals arrive posing as tourists, obtain domiciles, and then being to act as if they own the land. Consequently, violence will be directed toward those attempting to settle illegally,"" the TRF said.The TRF, which was banned by the government last year, has been involved in recruiting youth through the online medium for the furtherance of terrorist activities, recruitment of terrorists, infiltration of terrorists and smuggling of weapons and narcotics from Pakistan into J&K.The group came into existence in 2019 as a proxy of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba, which was involved in numerous terror acts, including the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.Sheikh Sajjad Gul is a commander of The Resistance Front and has been designated as a terrorist under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act 1967.TRF has been responsible for numerous attacks targeting civilians, security forces, and political figures in Jammu and Kashmir. Its operations are believed to be supported by Pakistani state mechanisms, including the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), aiming to sustain unrest in the region.In January 2023, the Indian government designated TRF as a terrorist organisation under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), and Sheikh Sajjad Gul was officially labelled a terrorist. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has since placed a bounty on Gul, reflecting the group's significant threat to regional stability.Union home minister Amit Shah arrived in Srinagar on Tuesday evening to assess the security situation in Kashmir following a deadly terrorist attack in Pahalgam that left 26 people dead.After landing, Shah headed straight to Raj Bhavan from the airport and is set to chair a high-level meeting with top security officials.

'She brought him home against his will': Retired top cop's son

Frequent fights,

property dispute

, mental health concerns

A career cut short by family tragedy

NEW DELHI: In a shocking twist to the death of former Karnataka DGP Om Prakash, Bengaluru Police have detained his wife, Pallavi, after she allegedly threw chilli powder in his face and stabbed him to death in their HSR Layout residence.Their daughter, Kriti, has also been detained for questioning as investigators dig deeper into what appears to be a domestic dispute turned deadly.The development comes following a formal complaint filed by the deceased officer’s son, who alleged that both women had a role in the killing.According to police sources, the 68-year-old retired IPS officer was killed following a heated argument with Pallavi, who reportedly lost control and attacked him with a knife after blinding him with chilli powder, reported PTI.The murder is said to have occurred on the ground floor of their three-storeyed home on Sunday, where Prakash was found lying in a pool of blood.What makes the case more chilling is what followed: PTI sources say Pallavi made a video call to a friend immediately after the incident and declared, “I have killed the monster.”Prakash's son Kartikesh has come forward with a damning accusation that his mother Pallavi had been threatening to kill his father for a week, and that his sister Kriti pressured him to return home just two days before his death.“Due to these threats, my father had gone to stay at his sister’s house,” Kartikesh said in his police complaint. “My younger sister Kriti went there and brought him back against his will.”According to the complaint, the fatal incident came to light around 5 pm on Sunday when a neighbor alerted Kartikesh while he was at the Karnataka Golf Association. “I rushed home and found police and others already there. My father was lying in a pool of blood with injuries on his head and body. A broken bottle and a knife were found near his body,” he said, adding that his father was taken to St John’s Hospital.“My mother Pallavi and sister Kriti used to fight with my father often. I strongly suspect they are involved in his murder,” he added, urging police to take legal action.Investigators believe the murder was the result of long-standing tensions in the family, including a property dispute over land in Dandeli, Karnataka. Sources said the couple had frequent confrontations, and Pallavi had even visited the HSR Layout police station months ago to file a complaint. When her grievance wasn't taken seriously, she allegedly staged a dharna outside the police station.Pallavi is also reportedly undergoing treatment for schizophrenia and has been on medication, police sources revealed.Om Prakash, a 1981-batch IPS officer from Champaran, Bihar, had an illustrious career in the Karnataka police force. He held a Master’s degree in Geology and rose through the ranks to serve as Director General and Inspector General of Police from March 1, 2015, until his retirement in March 2017.He began his service in Ballari district as Additional Superintendent of Police and held key roles in Shivamogga, Uttara Kannada, Chikkamagaluru, the Lokayukta, and the Fire and Emergency Services.The case has sparked massive interest in Karnataka and beyond, with police sources earlier confirming the use of a weapon and visible signs of physical assault. An autopsy report is awaited, and further investigation is underway.","Former Karnataka DGP Om Prakash, 68, was found dead in his home on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: It was around 3pm on March 20, 2000, when the serene landscape of Chittisinghpora was shattered by deafening sound of gunfire. The Valley was rattled with bursts of assault rifles as terrorists unleashed a hail of bullets on unsuspecting Sikh villagers. The afternoon calm was torn apart by the cries of the terrified and the dying, as the militants' bullets ripped through the village, leaving a trail of death and destruction in their wake.The killers were clad in Army fatigues, which allowed them to blend in with security forces that patrolled the area, the disguise underlining the planning that had gone into the masscare. But the meticulousness did not stop at that. The killers had planned the mass killing to coincide with the arrival of the then US President Bill Clinton in Delhi and the mayhem fitted in with the plan of Pakistan to keep the global spotlight trained on J&K, as a potential flashpoint for a confrontation between two nuclear-armed hostile neighbours, in order to secure international mediation.Killing of tourists during the presence of the US Veep J D Vance and, also, PM Modi's visit to Saudi immediately led many to draw parallels with the two rampages - the one on Tuesday coming against the backdrop of the success of Indian security forces against terrorists deployed by Pakistan in J&K as well as Islamabad's lament over its stale anti-India trope failing to resonate with global capitals, including the Islamic ones which before 2014 sympathised by the yarn spun by the hostile neighbour.Tuesday's attack bore similarities, with militants deliberately targeting non-Muslims, verifying their identities before unleashing a barrage of gunfire from their assault rifles. Two-decades ago, Sikhs were identified by their turbans before they were rounded up to be lined up and sprayed with bullets. In all, 35 persons, including women & children, were slain. After the attack, the militants fled the scene, disappearing in the jungles.The investigation had suggested the attack was carried out by Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hizbul Mujahideen terrorists. In the aftermath of the attack, Army and security forces launched a series of operations to apprehend the perpetrators.Despite the passage of time, the incident remains one of the most horrific acts of violence in the region's history.","Killing of tourists during the presence of the US Veep J D Vance and, also, PM Modi's visit to Saudi immediately led many to draw parallels.

NEW DELHI: The murder of former Karnataka Police chief om Prakash , allegedly by his wife, has sent shockwaves across the state as chilling details about the intensity and magnitude of the incident emerge.Prakash's wife Pallavi was arrested on Monday on a complaint by their son Kartikesh who suspected the involvement of his mother and sister in the killing. The case has also been transferred to the Central Crime Branch of Bengaluru (CCB) for further investigation.Prakash was found murdered in his HSR Layout house Sunday evening following an alleged heated exchange with his wife.According to police, Pallavi threw chilli powder and attacked 64-years-old Prakash with a kitchen knife as he was eating his lunch between 2.30pm and 3pm on Sunday. She initially stabbed him in the neck and later hit him with a bottle of oil, police sources said, citing Pallavi's statement and findings from the crime scene.According to sources, Prakash is suspected to have struggled lying on the floor for over 15 minutes before breathing his last. Two bottles — one of a toilet cleaner and another of floor cleaner — were found next to his body. Prakash is said to have attempted running out of the house as Pallavi attacked him, but she threw a blanket on his face and pushed him to the ground. She allegedly stabbed him multiple times in the neck, shoulder, abdomen, and back as Prakash pleaded with her to spare him.Pallavi stood next to Prakash who lay face down, his head wrapped in the blanket. He was wearing a lungi, banian (undershirt), and slippers. His lungi and banian were soaked in blood by the time a police team reached the spot, a senior officer said.There is suspicion that Kriti, the couple's daughter, was present on the same floor during the murder, but that is yet to be established. ""When our team reached the spot, she was in her house on the third floor,"" the officer added.When police took Pallavi to the crime scene, she told reporters there that ""domestic violence"" was the reason behind the extreme step. Sources claimed that after killing her husband, she made a video call to her friend, a retired officer's wife, and said, ""I have killed the monster.""Pallavi also called two others and informed them of the incident. One of them alerted police helpline 112. But before Hoysala police arrived at the spot, Pallavi herself had called HSR Layout police and informed them about the murder.Prakash's son Kartikesh said that on Sunday around 5 pm, when he was at the Karnataka Golf Association in Domlur, his neighbour called him to inform him that his father was found lying downstairs.In his complaint to the police after the incident, he alleged that his mother Pallavi had been threatening to kill his father for the past one week. ""Due to these threats, my father went to stay at his sister' s house ,"" he said.""Two days ago, my younger sister Kriti went there and pressured my father to return home. She brought him back against his will,"" Kartikesh alleged.""I rushed home and found police officers and people present on the spot. My father was lying in a pool of blood with injuries on his head and body. A broken bottle and a knife were found next to his body. He was then taken to St John's Hospital,"" he explained.""My mother Pallavi and my sister Kriti used to fight with my father often. I strongly suspect that they are involved in the murder of my father. I request you to initiate legal action in this case,"" he said in his complaint to the police.Sources said the murder was the culmination of frequent run-ins between the couple. It is learnt that a dispute over a piece of property in Karnataka's Dandeli was the focal point of the crime.Probe is on into multiple angles, including the property feud between the couple. A majority of Prakash's properties are in Uttara Kannada district. Prakash was superintendent of police, Uttara Kannada, in the early 1990s.Family sources told police Prakash had purchased a few acres of land in Joida during 2011-12. He has a farmhouse on five-acre land. Pallavi alleged that Prakash was not giving any property to her or her daughter, police sources said.Another senior police officer said a few days ago, Pallavi sent a message in the IPS officers' WhatsApp group requesting that a suo-motu case be registered and action taken against her husband. ""This is a distress call from Pallavi Omprakash. And an online FIR from me. Please take SUO. MOTO. Cognizance and SUO moto ACTION. Me and my daughter have been under severe domestic violence at the hands of my husband Omprakash, Ex DGP Karnataka (sic),"" the officer quoted Pallavi's message as saying.Pallavi claimed he was lacing her food with insulin and sanitiser. ""Now, he has started drugging my daughter, targeting her brain just because she started raising her voice. My daughter is dying every day. We are in a very precarious, dangerous, unsafe situation and need urgent help and security. My daughter's phone, laptop and all digital devices have been hacked or made dysfunctional. We need urgent security. As for proof, there is no dearth.""""My husband tries to cover up his acts by declaring people as mentally unstable as and when required... All these events are for the sake of property greed and jealousy. My husband is supporting my son and daughter-in-law. Greed. Lust for money corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely...,"" her message read.Kriti didn't open her third-floor house door for police Sunday; they had to force it open.

Good weather and venue conditions Strong leadership and planning

NEW DELHI: As the run up to the Bihar polls heats up, Manoj Kumar Pandey the now-suspended Congress Buxar district chief blamed ""soaring temperatures"" for ""inaction"" at party president Mallikarjun Kharge's Buxar rally. Pandey who was suspended on Monday, said that the turnout was decent but the extreme weather forced many attendees to seek shade.“There was a lot of crowd at the District Congress Committee office, we also have a video,” Pandey said. “Kharge ji was very happy, he even received us at the airport and was in a cheerful mood. His speech went on for 50 minutes and covered important historical points. But there was no fan arrangement in the back rows and it was 42 degrees. People naturally moved towards the trees on the sides for shelter, so some chairs looked empty.”Pandey maintained there was “no confusion” over the event’s organisation and reiterated that the heat was the primary factor behind the sparse appearance. “The crowd you’re talking about was in the back. With the sun beating down and no fans, they moved away. It was the weather, not the planning.”The Congress party on Monday had announced Pandey’s suspension, citing poor coordination and failure to mobilise local support ahead of the “Jai Bapu, Jai Bhim, Jai Samvidhan” rally. State Congress media cell chairman Rajesh Rathod confirmed the decision, accusing Pandey of “inaction” and “irregularities” in executing responsibilities.Eyewitnesses at the Dalsagar Football Ground located roughly 10km from Buxar town described a different picture, with more than 90% of chairs reportedly left unoccupied as Kharge addressed the crowd. Eyewitnesses said Congress MLA Sanjay Kumar Tiwary was seen urging people to fill the chairs, but the appeal was largely ignored.Party insiders told ANI that the turnout was embarrassing for senior leadership, especially as Kharge used the occasion to attack Prime Minister Narendra Modi over unfulfilled promises to Bihar and the misuse of central agencies against Congress leaders.When asked about his suspension, Pandey said only, “It was the party’s decision and the party’s decision is supreme.”The Congress is currently gearing up for a high-stakes battle in Bihar, with assembly elections due later this year.","Manoj Kumar Pandey the now-suspended Congress Buxar district chief blamed ""soaring temperatures"" for ""inaction"" at party president Mallikarjun Kharge's rally.

Is Sharpe Shannon the victim of a setup?



The Role of Tony Buzbee



What’s next for Shannon Sharpe?



NFL Hall of Famer and ESPN personality Shannon Sharpe is facing explosive accusations that could tarnish his legacy forever. A lawsuit filed by a woman under the pseudonym ""Jane Doe"" in Nevada claims Sharpe sexually assaulted and abused her over several months, with graphic details that paint a disturbing picture. But is there more to the story than the media is revealing? Let’s dive into the shocking allegations, the evidence, and whether Sharpe is truly guilty or the victim of a malicious attack.The lawsuit paints a dark picture of the relationship between Sharpe and the plaintiff. According to the woman, their initial meeting at a Los Angeles gym in 2023 led to an increasingly controlling and abusive relationship. Sharpe, who was in his 50s at the time, allegedly pursued the woman relentlessly, bombarding her with calls and texts and inviting her to his home on numerous occasions.The most shocking allegation comes from an argument in which Sharpe reportedly became physically aggressive. The plaintiff claims that Sharpe grabbed her by the neck and threatened her life, saying, “If you ever do that again, I will f—ing kill you.” The suit goes on to say that Sharpe sexually assaulted her multiple times, including an alleged rape after she tried to end their relationship.Sharpe allegedly moved the woman to Nevada in the summer of 2024, where the abuse continued. In a particularly disturbing incident in January 2025, Sharpe reportedly showed up at her house with gifts, then engaged in unprotected sex despite her protests. She claims she told him to stop or use protection, but Sharpe allegedly ignored her pleas.Sharpe has strongly denied all accusations, claiming that their relationship was consensual. His legal team released text messages from the plaintiff that appear to show a much different dynamic than what’s portrayed in the lawsuit. In the messages, the woman seems to communicate in a friendly, even flirtatious tone, which Sharpe’s defenders argue contradicts the claims of manipulation and abuse.However, there is a complicating factor: the woman has also released an audio recording of a conversation between herself and Sharpe in which he allegedly threatens her with violence. In the audio, Sharpe reportedly says, “I’m going to f—ing choke the s— out of you.” While Sharpe has not directly addressed the recording, the context remains unclear. Could it have been a heated argument that was blown out of proportion, or is it indicative of a broader pattern of violent behavior? The case now hinges on how both the audio and text messages are interpreted, and whether they support or undermine the serious claims made in the lawsuit.A key element in this case is the involvement of Tony Buzbee , the attorney representing the plaintiff. Known for his role in the Deshaun Watson case, Buzbee’s aggressive tactics have raised questions about whether the lawsuit is more about financial gain than justice. Sharpe’s defenders suggest this could be an attempt to pressure him into a settlement using media attention, especially since the civil lawsuit does not carry criminal charges, leaving the door open for a reputational attack without legal consequences.The legal battle between Sharpe and the woman under the ""Jane Doe"" pseudonym is far from over, but it’s already clear that the case will have lasting consequences for Sharpe's career and public image. While he continues to vehemently deny the allegations, the release of disturbing evidence like the threatening audio recording and the text messages casts a shadow over his defense.Also Read: “It’s one of the most stressful jobs”- Rob Gronkowski explains why NFL coaching isn’t for him Sharpe’s personal life is also under scrutiny, with his past relationships and history of media exposure fueling further controversy. Whether or not Sharpe is ultimately found guilty of the allegations, the public's perception of the Hall of Famer will never be the same. The spotlight that once celebrated his career now questions his character, casting a lasting impact on his legacy.","NFL Hall of Famer and ESPN personality Shannon Sharpe is facing explosive accusations that could tarnish his legacy forever.

SRINAGAR: At least 28 tourists were killed and many wounded on Tuesday when terrorists opened fire in a picturesque meadow near the resort town of Pahalgam in J&K, marking the deadliest attack since the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019. The Resistance Front , a proxy of ISI-backed LeT, claimed responsibility for the attack.The attack coincided with US Vice-President J D Vance's four-day visit to India and PM Narendra Modi's arrival in Saudi Arabia for strengthening bilateral engagement with the influential Islamic country. Equally significantly, it followed a bellicose speech of Asim Munir, chief of the Pakistan army, the mainstay of terrorists.This was the deadliest attack on tourists since militancy began in Kashmir in the 1990s. It brought back memories of the March 2000 massacre in Chittisinghpora in Anantnag district, where 36 members of the Sikh community were killed days before US President Bill Clinton's visit to India.The synchroneity fitted in well with Pakistan's attempt to secure international intervention in J&K by casting it as the trigger for a potential nuclear conflagration between the hostile neighbours.The targeting of tourists drawn from different parts, showed the diabolical intent and, perhaps, an attempt to cause communal unrest across the country. Jihadis have lately refrained from attacking tourists who bring valuable money to the Union territory.Survivors said the terrorists, believed to be foreigners numbering around six and dressed in Army fatigues, identified their victims by faith asking them to tell their names and recite Islamic verses before spraying bullets on them from close range.Gunmen struck around 1.30pm in Baisaran meadow - about 7km from Pahalgam and reachable either by foot and or byhorses - as scores of tourists were enjoying a regular afternoon, surrounded by snow-capped peaks and pine forests. Pahalgam's meadow is a top sightseeing spot that draws hundreds of visitors daily. Heavy security presence, including checkpoints and armed patrols, provided a sense of security.Victims included honeymooners such as Navy officer Vinay Narwal. Posted at Southern Naval Command in Kochi, the officer was married on April 16. Two foreign nationals - one from Nepal and the other from UAE - were also killed.Security forces quickly evacuated the wounded to nearby hospitals and launched a search operation to track down the attackers. The area was cordoned off.","At least 28 tourists were killed and many wounded on Tuesday when terrorists opened fire in a picturesque meadow near the resort town of Pahalgam in J&K.

Separation and rumors of a rekindled bond

WWE fans were thrilled to see the return of Rusev, a dominant force in the ring - on the latest episode of RAW after WrestleMania 41. But while his in-ring comeback made headlines, it also renewed interest in his personal life, especially his high-profile relationship with former WWE star Lana, real name CJ Perry.So who exactly is Rusev’s wife? And what is the story behind their relationship? Here’s everything you need to know about the former United States Champion’s marriage, split, and recent update.Rusev and Lana’s story began in WWE’s developmental territory NXT, where Lana was introduced as Rusev’s manager and social ambassador. Their chemistry quickly clicked, and the duo transitioned to WWE’s main roster during the 2014 Royal Rumble. Together, they portrayed a controversial “anti-American” heel couple, drawing significant attention and heat from fans.But behind the storyline, their real-life romance was blossoming. Despite scripted breakups on-screen (involving love triangles with Dolph Ziggler, Summer Rae, and Bobby Lashley), the couple announced their engagement in 2015 and tied the knot in real life on July 29, 2016.Over the years, their WWE storylines mirrored chaos in real life. After Rusev lost his momentum following a defeat to John Cena at WrestleMania 31, tensions reportedly grew behind the scenes. Lana’s storyline relationships and accusations, including a bizarre angle claiming Rusev was a “sex addict” - only added to the drama.In 2020, Rusev was released from WWE as part of budget cuts during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lana was let go in 2021. Rusev moved to AEW under the ring name “Miro,” while Lana took a break before joining AEW in 2023. However, by this point, their marriage had already hit a rough patch.In March 2024, TMZ confirmed that Miro and CJ Perry had officially separated after seven years of marriage. Lana shared that the decision was mutual and rooted in them growing apart, not infidelity or abuse. The former couple promised to remain friends and even hinted at future onscreen collaboration.However, in an unexpected twist, reports in March 2025 suggested the two had rekindled their relationship and renewed their vows in a private ceremony. While neither has officially confirmed the remarriage, fans have noted their increasing public appearances together - including at backstage segments during WrestleMania weekend.With Rusev now back in WWE and Lana reportedly signing a Legends deal with the company, the power couple could once again become a staple of WWE programming. Whether it’s ringside antics or storyline partnerships, fans are excited to see what’s next for the Bulgarian Brute - and the woman who’s been by his side through it all.","Rusev and Lana's story began in WWE’s developmental territory NXT.

Antonio Brown breaks silence with shady jab at Shannon Sharpe amid explosive $50M assault lawsuit

Shannon Sharpe is facing serious accusations in a $50 million sexual assault lawsuit, and the news has drawn a loud reaction from someone who’s never been shy about speaking his mind — Antonio Brown . As Sharpe works to defend himself publicly and legally, Brown took to social media with a not-so-subtle jab that’s stirring even more conversation.Antonio Brown isn’t one to bite his tongue — and Shannon Sharpe just found himself on the receiving end of another classic AB dig. Following the emergence of a $50 million sexual assault lawsuit against the Hall of Fame tight end, Brown took to social media with a message that raised eyebrows: “This n***a ain’t slick…” followed by a rainbow and dinosaur emoji.The post came shortly after Sharpe and his legal team, led by Lanny J. Davis, released alleged text messages from Gabriella Zuniga — the woman suing him — to refute her accusations. Zuniga, now represented by Tony Buzbee (best known for representing many of Deshaun Watson’s accusers), claims a rocky relationship turned violent, with multiple alleged assaults in late 2024.According to court documents, Zuniga first met Sharpe at a Los Angeles gym in 2023. What began as consensual escalated into a darker pattern of control, she alleges. One incident reportedly involved Sharpe forcing her into a car, then into unwanted sexual acts at her apartment. Another came just weeks later, under the pretense of delivering a gift.While Sharpe has denied all allegations, the situation has already begun to ripple through NFL circles and media. The leaked texts and rapid-fire social reactions have only added more tension to a story that’s far from over.Brown, who has a long history of antagonizing Sharpe online, previously accused him and other former players of steroid use and mocked his business ventures. His latest remark isn’t surprising — but the timing certainly fuels the drama.Also Read: Tom Brady reignites feud with Eli Manning by slapping $0 tag on his trading card As the case plays out, Sharpe is expected to continue defending himself publicly.

The SignalGate Scandal

Trump’s Dilemma: Loyalty vs Liability



Pentagon in Disarray



An Unforced Error



“Ask the Houthis how he’s doing,” President Trump quipped this Easter Monday, defending his embattled Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth . But behind the bravado and bunny suits on the White House lawn, top officials are privately doing just that — asking if Hegseth’s tenure, marred by leaks, insubordination, and now a national security scandal, is becoming untenable.According to a senior US official not authorised to speak on the record, the White House has quietly begun the search for a replacement. The catalyst? A second revelation that Hegseth shared sensitive, minute-by-minute details of airstrikes in Yemen — not just with aides, but in a private Signal group that included his wife, brother, and lawyer.If the first leak was a lapse, the second looks like a pattern. And patterns — especially those that risk lives — are rarely tolerated long in Washington, even in a Trump-led administration where loyalty often trumps protocol.The SignalGate saga began with a bombshell: Hegseth had inadvertently looped a journalist into a private Signal chat with top White House officials just hours before a coordinated airstrike on Houthi targets. That alone triggered alarm bells across the Pentagon , as adversaries like Iran and the Houthis have demonstrated a growing capability to intercept communications and retaliate — already having shot down two American drones this year.Now, the existence of a second, even more cavalier chat thread — this time with family — has sparked internal panic. According to officials, the chats included real-time strike updates, precise targeting information, and assessments before missions had even launched.“This isn't just bad judgement. It's operational malpractice,” said Rep. Jim Himes, a senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.Publicly, Trump has stood by Hegseth — calling him a “great patriot” and dismissing the uproar as “media hysteria.” But behind closed doors, aides are reportedly weighing how long the president can afford to defend a man increasingly viewed as a national security risk.For Trump, the decision is politically fraught. Hegseth is a loyalist, a fellow Fox News alumnus, and a face of the Trump-era military ethos: brash, anti-bureaucratic, and deeply ideological. But even in Trumpworld, loyalty has limits — especially when headlines shift from ""tough on terror"" to ""reckless with secrets.""One former official described the West Wing mood as “tense and tired” — a recognition that keeping Hegseth may be more costly than letting him go.Adding to the drama is the exodus of senior staff. Four top Pentagon advisers either resigned or were forcibly removed in the past week. Former spokesperson John Ullyot, once a Hegseth ally, now paints a dire picture of dysfunction, calling it a “full-blown meltdown.”The purge has fueled speculation that Hegseth is not just leaking — he’s losing control.Dan Caldwell and Darin Selnick, two of the aides escorted out, were close allies of Hegseth from his Concerned Veterans for America days. In a defiant joint statement, they accused the Pentagon of political scapegoating , saying they still hadn’t been told what they supposedly leaked.“All three of us served honorably in Iraq and Afghanistan,” they wrote. “We know what operational security means.”Their defence — and their sudden dismissal — adds another layer of intrigue. Is Hegseth cleaning house to protect himself? Or is the house simply collapsing?To many defence experts, Hegseth's appointment was always a gamble. A former weekend TV host and Iraq War veteran with no prior experience managing large institutions, he was an odd choice to run the Pentagon — a behemoth of 3 million personnel and a $900 billion budget.That oddity is now a liability.Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, bluntly called for accountability — not just from Hegseth, but from Trump.“This is what happens when a complex, consequential job is given to someone with a resume built on primetime rants and MAGA bromides,” she said.The EndgameWhether Hegseth survives this scandal may ultimately depend less on the Pentagon than on politics. Trump, facing rising global tensions and seeking re-election, may decide that the symbolism of strength matters more than the substance of discipline.But make no mistake — the knives are out.And if history is any guide, Trump doesn’t fire his loyalists until the threat becomes existential. Hegseth may still have a few weeks of borrowed time. But in Washington, as with warfare, leaks have a way of sinking even the most loyal ships.","Pete Hegseth's tenure has been marred by leaks, insubordination, and now a national security scandal.

MUMBAI: The school bus operators ’ case opposing illegal vans in Mumbai in the interest of child safety came up in Bombay high court on Tuesday and matter has been posted for hearing on June 10 along with hearing on a pending PIL on the same issue.The petitioner's advocate mentioned that schools will be starting from June, and should be heard at the earliest. The court subsequently announced it will hear the case on June 10.The operators are opposing the growing menace of illegal vans ferrying school children packed in cramped conditions and operating without proper permits in several parts of the city.Representatives of the SBOA have stated that they have repeatedly approached the transport commissioner’s office, submitting petitions along with proof of illegal van operations in Mumbai, but the problem persists.""The ongoing legal case will also challenge certain government policies and highlight police action against school buses for illegal parking, despite there being no designated parking areas for school buses as requested in previous petitions to the government,"" said SBOA president Anil Garg.According to school bus operators, the number of illegal vans and private vehicles ferrying school children with scant regard for student safety or compliance with transport department rules has increased by 2.5 times the number of legitimate school buses currently operating in Mumbai. While the number of compliant school buses is now around 6,000—a marked decrease from 8,000 a few years ago—the tally of ‘unscrupulous’ vehicles has surged to approximately 15,000 in the metropolis.Bus owners highlighted the proliferation of small vans, private cars, autorickshaws, and black-and-yellow taxis transporting school children. “The vans and private vehicles openly flout rules, compromise student safety by cramming several children into small, cramped vehicles without attendants. There are no road or fire safety measures in place, and the state government’s school bus safety policy is being violated,” Garg pointed out.Association members said that in some photos already taken, they discovered several vans operating with expired PUC, fitness certificates, no permit, and lacking vehicle insurance.According to sources in SBOA, CNG gas cylinders are found in many vans ferrying students, with young children often made to sit on a plank placed above the CNG cylinder, which is extremely dangerous.",School bus operators oppose illegal vans ferrying children in Mumbai.

President Trump Says Tariffs With China Will Come Down Substantially | WSJ News

US president Donald Trump has suggested that the historically high tariffs he imposed on Chinese imports will not last. Speaking from the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump told reporters the 145% tariff rate would eventually “come down substantially,” even as he maintained a confident tone about the US's bargaining position.""145% is very high, and it won't be that high,"" Trump said. ""No, it won't be anywhere near that high. It'll come down substantially. But it won't be zero ‒ used to be zero. We were just destroyed. China was taking us for a ride.""“We’re going to be very nice, they’re going to be very nice, and we’ll see what happens. But ultimately,” he added, “they have to make a deal because otherwise they’re not going to be able to deal in the United States.”Trump’s shift in tone came shortly after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned behind closed doors that the ongoing US-China trade standoff is untenable. “No one thinks the current status quo is sustainable,” Bessent reportedly told investors at a JP Morgan Chase forum in Washington.The current tariff landscape reflects multiple rounds of escalation, with Chinese imports now subject to tariffs totalling 145%. In response, China has imposed retaliatory tariffs of 125% on US exports.Electronics such as smartphones and semiconductors remain exempt, while a 20% “blanket” tariff linked to fentanyl-related concerns remains in place.Formal negotiations between Washington and Beijing have not begun. However, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said more than 100 countries have expressed interest in new trade arrangements following Trump’s recent announcement of global tariffs—though China is not yet among them.Despite the absence of dialogue with Beijing, Leavitt maintained the administration is “setting the stage” for a future deal with China and is “doing very well” on trade overall.Market reactions suggest cautious optimism. US stock indexes surged over 2% after Bessent’s remarks, hinting that investors may be betting on a future easing of tensions—even if the road to any agreement remains long.",US president Donald Trump has suggested that the historically high tariffs he imposed on Chinese imports will not last.

WATCH: AG Bondi ""anti-Christian"" task force announcement

Trump’s religious rhetoric

What's Trump's religion?

US President Donald Trump has launched a federal task force to investigate alleged "" anti-Christian bias "" in government workplaces . The initiative, unveiled by Attorney General Pam Bondi on Tuesday, urges federal employees to report colleagues for perceived hostility toward Christian beliefs.The task force was created through an executive order signed by Trump, who continues to position himself as a defender of conservative Christian values. The order comes despite Christians forming the religious majority in the United States—about two-thirds of the population—and enjoying significant political representation.Federal employees have now been instructed to report suspected bias against Christian beliefs, providing names, dates, and details. A memo from Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins asked staff to flag any informal practices they believe are hostile to Christian views. Similar instructions have gone out to other agencies, including the State Department.Trump’s renewed focus on “Christian persecution” follows years of courting evangelical voters. His administration includes several known Christian nationalists, such as Vice President JD Vance and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth.Though Donald Trump is not Catholic, he has been using more religious language in his public speeches, especially in recent years. His focus on faith became even stronger after a failed assassination attempt during a campaign rally. At the National Prayer Breakfast in February, Trump said, “God was watching me,” and spoke about the need for religion to play a bigger role in public life. “We have to make religion a much more important factor now,” he said. “It unifies people.”As part of this renewed focus, Trump signed an executive order in February to set up a White House Faith Office. The aim, according to him, is to address what he calls “anti-Christian bias” in the federal government.Evangelical pastor Paula White, who has been one of Trump’s closest spiritual advisers, continues to play a leading role in his faith-based efforts. She had earlier headed the White House Faith and Opportunity Initiative during Trump’s first term.For many years, Donald Trump identified as a mainline Protestant and regularly attended Marble Collegiate Church in New York. He often spoke about being influenced by the church’s well-known pastor, Norman Vincent Peale, who preached the power of positive thinking. But in a 2020 interview with Religion News Service, Trump shared that his religious views had shifted.“Though I was confirmed at a Presbyterian church as a child, I now consider myself to be a nondenominational Christian,” he said.Trump explained that the change came after he and First Lady Melania Trump started attending different types of churches and listening to a variety of spiritual leaders. He also mentioned that during the Covid-19 pandemic, they often joined online worship services, which gave them new perspectives on faith.","US President Donald Trump has launched a federal task force to investigate alleged "" anti-Christian bias "" in government workplaces.

New Jersey Wildfire Causes Evacuations

A fast-moving wildfire in Barnegat Township, Ocean County, New Jersey, has prompted mandatory evacuations for residents in several areas. According to the New Jersey Forest Fire Service, the fire has already burned about 1,200 acres and remains completely uncontained.Evacuations are currently underway along Wells Mills Road, between Bryant Road and the Garden State Parkway. CBS news reported that authorities have confirmed sixteen structures are under threat and have been evacuated as a precaution. Aerial footage from the area shows parts of the Greenwood Forest Wildlife Management Area engulfed in flames, with thick smoke visible from miles away.The wildfire has also caused significant traffic disruption. The Garden State Parkway has been shut in both directions near Exit 69. Several local roads have also been closed, including Rt. 532 (Wells Mills Road) from Route 72 to the Parkway, Bryant Road between Rt. 532 and Rt. 539, and Jones Road between Rt. 532 and Bryant Road.Firefighting crews have deployed both a helicopter and a fixed-wing aircraft to drop water on the fire in an effort to slow its spread. No injuries have been reported so far.Officials have urged the public to stay away from the area and strictly advised against flying drones in the fire zone, which can interfere with emergency aircraft. The cause of the wildfire is still under investigation.","A fast-moving wildfire in Barnegat Township, Ocean County, New Jersey, has prompted mandatory evacuations for residents in several areas.

Absolutely not. I think it's terrible,"" Usha Vance said in an interview with The Free Press. She noted in the same interview that these racist attacks are nothing new. ""I think it's our relationship to this information that is potentially new,"" she said referring to the invasion of social media that lends voice to this trolling.Many MAGA insiders, mostly white supremacists, launched their hate campaign against Usha during the election.

Mahmoud Khalil: Trump admin bars pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil from attending son's birth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-admin-bars-pro-palestinian-activist-mahmoud-khalil-from-attending-sons-birth/articleshow/120517974.cms,"FILE - Student negotiator Mahmoud Khalil is seen at a pro-Palestinian protest encampment on the Columbia University campus in New York, April 29, 2024. (AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey, File)

The Trump administration denied Mahmoud Khalil , a legal permanent US resident and prominent pro-Palestinian activist , permission to attend the birth of his first child in New York on Monday, despite urgent legal appeals and proposed safeguards for his temporary release from immigration detention .Khalil, 30, first gained national attention as an organiser of pro-Palestinian demonstrations at Columbia University last year. A doctoral candidate in Middle Eastern studies, he became a vocal figure in the student-led movement calling for divestment from Israeli companies and an end to what activists described as university complicity in the Gaza conflict. His speeches condemning both antisemitism and anti-Palestinian hate earned him support from a wide cross-section of students, though they also drew the scrutiny of federal authorities under the Trump administration.Khalil has been held for over a month in a detention centre in Jena, Louisiana. His lawyers had requested a two-week monitored furlough so he could be with his wife, Dr Noor Abdalla, for the delivery. The Department of Homeland Security rejected the request within an hour.“A two-week furlough in this civil detention matter would be both reasonable and humane so that both parents can be present for the birth of their first child,” Khalil’s lawyers wrote. They proposed electronic monitoring and daily check-ins to ensure compliance.But Melissa Harper, director of the New Orleans field office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ), summarily denied the request, saying it had been reviewed “after consideration of the submitted information and a review of your client’s case.”Khalil was ultimately able to speak to his wife by phone during parts of the delivery. Both mother and child are healthy, according to their legal team.Dr Abdalla issued a statement on Monday, calling ICE’s refusal “a purposeful decision... to make me, Mahmoud, and our son suffer.”“My son and I should not be navigating his first days on earth without Mahmoud. ICE and the Trump administration have stolen these precious moments from our family in an attempt to silence Mahmoud’s support for Palestinian freedom,” she said.Khalil’s lawyer, Marc Van Der Hout, called the denial “utterly punitive,” emphasising that no evidence had been presented that his client was either a danger to the community or a flight risk.The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to queries about the decision.Khalil’s case has become a flashpoint in the Trump administration’s escalating crackdown on pro-Palestinian activists on US campuses. He was arrested last month outside his New York apartment in what lawyers have described as a coordinated sweep against demonstrators. In a controversial move, Secretary of State Marco Rubio invoked a Cold War-era provision to initiate deportation proceedings , arguing Khalil’s presence in the US posed a threat to American foreign policy.Rubio claimed Khalil had enabled the spread of antisemitism and accused him of links to Hamas — an accusation that Khalil and his lawyers have categorically denied. They point to his repeated public condemnation of antisemitism and insist there is no evidence tying him to any proscribed groups.An immigration judge in Louisiana has since ruled that Khalil can be deported based on Rubio’s memo, but a New Jersey federal judge has stayed his removal while constitutional challenges are considered. Motions for bail and a transfer back to the East Coast remain pending in court.The refusal to grant even a temporary release for the birth of his son is being seen by civil liberties groups as part of a broader pattern of punitive immigration enforcement targeting dissent during Trump’s second term.","Mahmoud Khalil, 30, has been held for over a month in a detention centre in Jena, Louisiana.

Rage against science

Generational damage

From cancer cures to climate change, President Donald Trump's administration has upended the American research landscape, threatening the United States' standing as a global science leader and sowing fear over jobs and funding.Mass layoffs at renowned federal agencies. Billions in research grants slashed. Open threats against universities. Bans on words linked to gender and human-caused global warming - all within the first 100 days.""It's just colossal,"" Paul Edwards, who leads a department at Stanford University focused on the interaction between society and science, told AFP. ""I have not seen anything like this ever in the United States in my 40 year career.""The sentiment is widely shared across the scientific and academic community. At the end of March, more than 1,900 leading elected members of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, sounded an SOS in an open statement, warning that using financial threats to control which studies are funded or published amounted to censorship and undermines science's core mission: the quest for truth.""The nation's scientific enterprise is being decimated,"" they wrote, calling on the administration ""to cease its wholesale assault"" on US science and urging members of the public to join them.Even during Trump's first term, the scientific community had warned of an impending assault on science, but by all accounts, today's actions are far more sweeping.""This is definitely bigger, more coordinated,"" said Jennifer Jones, director of the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, who described the administration as operating straight from the Project 2025 playbook.That ultra-conservative blueprint - closely followed by the Republican billionaire since returning to power - calls for restructuring or dismantling key scientific and academic institutions, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which it accuses of promoting ""climate alarmism.""Trump's officials have echoed these views, including Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic who has tapped into public distrust of science, amplified during the Covid-19 pandemic.The result, says Sheila Jasanoff, a professor at Harvard, is a breakdown of the tacit contract that once bound the state to the production of knowledge.Harvard, now a primary target in Trump's campaign against academia, has faced frozen grants, threats to its tax-exempt status, and potential limits on enrolling international students -- moves framed as combating antisemitism and ""woke"" ideology, but widely viewed as political overreach.""The rage against science, to me, is most reminiscent of a fundamentalist religious rage,"" Jasanoff told AFP.Faced with this shift, a growing number of researchers are considering leaving the United States a potential brain drain from which other countries hope to benefit by opening the doors of their universities.In France, lawmakers have introduced a bill to create a special status for ""scientific refugees."" Some will leave, but many may simply give up, warns Daniel Sandweiss, a climate science professor at the University of Maine, who fears the loss of an entire generation of rising talent.""It's the rising students, the superstars who are just beginning to come up,"" he said, ""and we're going to be missing a whole bunch of them.""Many US industries, including pharmaceuticals depend on this talent to drive innovation. But now, said Jones, ""there's a real danger they'll fill those gaps with junk science and discredited researchers.""One such figure is David Geier, an anti-vaccine activist previously found to have practiced medicine without a license, who has been appointed by Kennedy to study the debunked link between vaccines and autism a move critics say guarantees a biased result.""The level of disinformation and confusion this administration is creating will take years, potentially generations to undo,"" said Jones.","Scientists sound alarm as Trump reshapes US research landscape.

A federal judge said Tuesday that the Trump administration is ignoring court orders, obstructing the legal process and acting in ""bad faith"" by refusing to provide information about the steps they have taken, if any, to free a mistakenly deported Maryland man from an El Salvador prison and return him to the US. ""For weeks, Defendants have sought refuge behind vague and unsubstantiated assertions of privilege, using them as a shield to obstruct discovery and evade compliance with this Court's orders,"" US District Judge Paula Xinis wrote an the order Tuesday.""Defendants have known, at least since last week, that this Court requires specific legal and factual showings to support any claim of privilege. Yet they have continued to rely on boilerplate assertions. That ends now.""She gave the administration until 6 pm Wednesday to provide those details.The US Supreme Court ordered the Trump administration nearly two weeks ago to facilitate Kilmar Abrego Garcia's return to the US from a notorious Salvadoran prison, rejecting the White House's claim that it couldn't retrieve him after mistakenly deporting him.Trump administration officials have pushed back, arguing that it is up to El Salvador - though the president of El Salvador has also said he lacks the power to return Abrego Garcia. The administration has also argued that information about any steps it has taken or could take to return Abrego Garcia is protected by attorney-client privilege laws, state secret laws, general ""government privilege"" or other secrecy rules.But Xinis said those claims, without any facts to back them up, reflected a ""willful and bad faith refusal to comply with discovery obligations.""It's not the first time the Trump administration has faced a scathing order from a federal judge over its approach to deportation cases.A three-judge panel on the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals scolded the administration last week, saying its claim that it can't do anything to free Abrego Garcia ""should be shocking.""That ruling came one day after a federal judge in Washington, DC, found probable cause to hold the Trump administration in criminal contempt of court for violating his orders to turn around planes carrying deportees to El Salvador in a different legal case.Democrats and legal scholars say President Donald Trump is provoking a constitutional crisis in part by ignoring court rulings, while the White House has said it's the judges who are the problem.","US District Judge Paula Xinis says the Trump administration is acting in ""bad faith"" She gave the administration until 6 pm Wednesday to provide details on the case.

USFDA to 'phase out' eight approved synthetic food dyes by 2027,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/usfda-to-phase-out-eight-approved-synthetic-food-dyes-by-2027/articleshow/120530250.cms,"United States Food and Drug Administration

US President Donald Trump's administration on Tuesday announced its plans to ban synthetic dyes from the country's food supply, a move which would see the eight approved artificial food dyes being phased out by the end of 2026.""For the last 50 years, American children have increasingly been living in a toxic soup of synthetic chemicals,"" Food and Drug Administration (FDA) commissioner Marty Makary said at a press conference, surrounded by young families.Makary cited studies linking synthetic dyes to conditions including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, diabetes, cancer, genomic disruption, gastrointestinal issues and more.Of the eight synthetic dyes derived from petroleum, Yellow 5, Yellow 6 and Red 40 constitute the lion's share of those in use, according to Peter Lurie, president and executive director of the non-profit Center for Science in the Public Interest.These are found in a range of products from beverages and candies to cereals, sauces and dairy products.""None of them convey anything of any nutritional significance, and what they're really there for is to mislead -- to make food appear somehow redder, somehow bluer, somehow fruitier or more attractive than it is. And the purpose of all that is to drive up sales, it's not anything that benefits the American public,"" Lurie told news agency AFP.FDA commissioner Makary's announcement on synthetic dyes builds upon a prohibition on Red Dye 3 by the previous Joe Biden administration. However, it accelerates the timeline, and directs the National Institutes of Health to carry out ""comprehensive research"" on how additives impact kids' development.US health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr. has repeatedly vowed to ""overhaul"" America's food system under the banner of his ""Make America Healthy Again"" agenda.However, industry opposition to the announced ban could still emerge. Food manufacturers have historically lobbied against tighter regulations, but Lurie believes resistance may be more muted this time.""The question that industries are wrestling with now is whether or not to oppose this, and you know, the signs that I see are that they may just suck it up in the end,"" he stated.He cited ""tepid"" statements made when Red 3 was banned and the limited response when Kennedy first warned he would be targeting dyes.","US to ban eight approved artificial food dyes by the end of 2026.
