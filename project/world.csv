Jeju Air Crash: Pilots shut off wrong engine; probe finds clear evidence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/jeju-air-crash-pilots-shut-off-wrong-engine-probe-finds-clear-evidence/articleshow/122811341.cms,"



South Korean investigators have found clear evidence that pilots of the Jeju Air plane that crashed in December shut down the wrong engine after a bird strike, a source familiar with the probe said on Monday.The investigation, led by South Korea’s Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board (ARAIB), has found that the left engine, which was less damaged, was shut off instead of the right engine, which had been more seriously affected by the bird strike.The source told Reuters that cockpit voice recordings, computer data, and a physical engine switch recovered from the wreckage support this conclusion.""The investigation team has clear evidence and backup data, so its finding will not change,"" the source said, speaking anonymously as the official report has not yet been released.The Boeing 737-800 aircraft, operating a flight from Bangkok, crashed while attempting to land at Muan Airport on 29 December 2024. Of the 181 people on board, only two survived, making it the deadliest air disaster on South Korean soil.An examination of the recovered engines confirmed there were no defects before the bird strike and the crash, according to a government source.Investigators reportedly shared these findings with the victims' families during a private briefing on Saturday.A third source, who was present at the meeting, said the families were told the right engine had suffered greater damage, but the left, less-damaged, engine was shut down instead.The ARAIB has not officially commented on the findings. Boeing, the aircraft manufacturer, directed queries to ARAIB. Engine manufacturer CFM International, a joint venture between GE and France’s Safran, has not responded to requests for comment.Jeju Air said it is actively cooperating with the investigation and is awaiting the official release of the results.While a preliminary report issued in January confirmed the presence of duck remains in both engines, it did not specify the extent of damage. A scheduled media briefing on Saturday was cancelled after victims’ families objected to the report being made public, saying it unfairly focused on pilot error and failed to consider other factors.The Jeju Air flight overshot the runway during an emergency belly landing and crashed into an embankment containing navigation equipment. The collision caused a fire and a partial explosion, Reuters reported.Victims’ families and the pilots’ union have urged the investigation team to also examine the embankment’s role in the severity of the crash. Aviation experts believe the structure may have contributed to the high death toll.The pilots’ union has criticised ARAIB for “misleading the public” by suggesting there was no problem with the left engine, even though bird remains were found in both engines. The union accused the investigators of making the pilots scapegoats and not providing enough scientific evidence to prove the aircraft could have landed safely with just the left engine running.The union also said the investigation has so far failed to address possible organisational responsibility. A group representing the bereaved families added that the language in the planned press release made it appear as if a final conclusion had already been reached. They have called for all facts surrounding the crash to be fully examined and clarified.Under international aviation rules, a final accident report is expected within a year of the incident.","South Korean investigators have found clear evidence that pilots of the Jeju Air plane that crashed in December shut down the wrong engine after a bird strike.

MUMBAI: In a detailed order granting bail to a 40-year-old teacher from a prominent Mumbai school arrested for allegedly sexually assaulting a male student, a special Pocso court said that there is evidence from both sides showing that subsequently there was a consensual relationship between them. Noting the victim was over 17 years old, special judge Sabina A Malik said, ""As the accused resigned from the school, the relationship of a teacher and student no longer existed and hence, the influence is diluted."" The judge further mentioned that the trial will take time to commence and in the meantime, nothing fruitful would be gained by keeping the accused behind bars.The victim opposed the bail plea, submitting that if the woman is released on bail, she will once again find ways to manipulate, intimidate, threaten and harm his life, and she will also tamper with the evidence. However, the judge said, ""The potential risk to the victim, if any, could be catered to by imposing necessary terms and conditions. The apprehension of the prosecution can be taken care of by imposing stringent conditions on the applicant (accused),"" the judge said.Imposing conditions on the release, the judge said the accused must not meet, contact or threaten the victim in any manner. She is forbidden from directly or indirectly inducing, threatening or promising anything to any witness or the victim.The judge said breach of any of these conditions will result in immediate bail cancellation.The maximum punishment attracted in the case is imprisonment for the remainder of that person's natural life. The woman, who resigned from the school last year, was arrested on June 29. She said she is working in a different field now. The prosecution also opposed the bail, referring to the mental trauma suffered by the minor.Seeking bail, the woman's defence lawyers, Neeraj Yadav and Deepa Punjani, submitted that the case against her is ""false and fabricated and motivated."" It was also submitted that her grounds for arrest were provided solely in Marathi, a language she does not comprehend. She alleged that the grounds were never translated for her and that she was merely instructed to sign them, thereby failing to satisfy the mandate of the Constitution.","A 40-year-old teacher from a prominent Mumbai school was arrested for allegedly sexually assaulting a male student.

She slapped the woman while gesturing toward Jha and the others, continuing to shout. Following this, the other man in the group confronted the receptionist, and Jha returned, assaulting her with a kick and slamming her to the ground.He was then pulled away by those with him.

NEW DELHI: A “serial borrower” from the IMF, Pakistan is steeped in fanaticism and terrorism, said India at the UN Security Council (UNSC) as Islamabad brought up the Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) issue in an open debate it organised under its July presidency of the Council on peaceful settlement of disputes.The meeting ended with the unanimous adoption of a Pakistan-sponsored resolution urging member-states to effectively utilize mechanisms for pacific settlement of disputes as outlined in the UN Charter Article 33, including “negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration…or other peaceful means of their choice”. The resolution did not name Kashmir or any other issue.In the debate presided over by Pakistan deputy PM and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, the US representative doubled down on President Donald Trump’s ceasefire claims, saying that the US leadership delivered ""de-escalations between Israel and Iran, between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, and between India and Pakistan”.After Dar raised issues related to J&K and New Delhi’s decision to place the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance, Indian ambassador P Harish responded by asserting that it ill behoves a member of the Council to offer homilies while indulging in practices that are unacceptable to the international community.“The Indian Sub-Continent offers a stark contrast in terms of progress, prosperity and development models. On the one hand, there is India which is a mature democracy, a surging economy and a pluralistic and inclusive society.At the other extreme is Pakistan, steeped in fanaticism and terrorism, and a serial borrower from the IMF,” said Harish, adding that zero tolerance for terrorism is one of the fundamental principles that need to be respected while promoting international peace and security.The open debate on unresolved disputes was one of the signature events that Pakistan is organising under its presidency of the Council, the other being the upcoming meeting on UN-OIC cooperation. The resolution on pacific settlement of disputes was generic in nature, as it’s unlikely it would have found unanimous support from the Council by explicitly mentioning or talking about disputes.Pakistan had through the resolution urged full use of all Chapter VI mechanisms of the UN Charter for peaceful resolution of disputes between nations, hoping to spotlight the J&K issue. While Article 33 of the Chapter states that the parties to any dispute shall seek a solution by, among other things, mediation and arbitration, it also says the parties can seek a solution through “other peaceful means of their own choice”. For India, its emphasis on bilateralism in line with the Simla and Lahore Declarations conforms to other peaceful means.In his remarks, Harish highlighted the fact that Chapter begins with a recognition that it is the ‘parties to a dispute’ who must first of all seek a solution by peaceful means of their own choice. “National ownership and consent of parties are central to any efforts to achieve peaceful resolution of conflicts,” he said.Harish also said that there should be a serious cost to states who violate the spirit of good neighbourliness and international relations by fomenting cross-border terrorism, while mentioning the Pahalgam terrorist attack and its condemnation by the Council that underlined the need to hold perpetrators, organizers, financiers and sponsors to justice.“India launched Operation Sindoor targeting terrorist camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK), which was focused, measured, and non-escalatory in nature. On achieving its primary objectives, a cessation of military activities was directly concluded at the request of Pakistan,” he said.",Pakistan hosted an open debate at the UN Security Council on peaceful settlement of disputes.

Investigators went through witness accounts, reviewed footage from CCTV cameras installed within a 2km radius, and conducted forensic analysis of the area for vehicle movement but failed to find any evidence to support the girl's claims.The girl, who is allegedly traumatised, requires more time to stabilise before providing further details that can help clarify the sequence of events. The teenager was airlifted to AIIMS, Delhi, from AIIMS, Bhubaneswar. She is admitted in the burn ICU at AIIMS, Delhi, and underwent surgery for management of her injuries, hospital sources said Wednesday. Dr Rima Dada, professor in-charge, media cell, AIIMS, Delhi, said the patient was critical and on oxygen support.In the absence of evidence to confirm or refute the girl's claims, police are awaiting her recovery to gather a more accurate account of the case, suggesting the probe might drag on.A witness, who was nearby during the alleged attack, reported not seeing any motorcycle at the time.Initially, the probe focused on the teenager's statement and her mother's complaint, which accused three unidentified men of attacking her with a flammable liquid.

Who is Bryan Kohberger?





Bryan Kohberger, the culprit behind 2022 University of Idaho student killings, has been sentenced to four consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole.The sentencing took place on Wednesday in a Boise courtroom, where family members of the victims and two surviving roommates confronted Kohberger with powerful, emotional statements.Kohberger, who earlier this month pleaded guilty as part of a deal to avoid the death penalty, appeared in court wearing an orange prison jumpsuit. When invited to speak, he simply said, “I respectfully decline.” Murmurs of “Coward” and “Surprise, surprise” could be heard from the victims’ families in the courtroom.Judge Steven Hippler, before delivering the sentence, described Kohberger as a “faceless coward” and expressed admiration for the courage shown by the victims’ families. He also admired the courage shown by the victims' families who spoke in court. He also condemned Kohberger for showing no remorse or regret for the killings. While he acknowledged he couldn’t legally compel Kohberger to reveal his motive, he added that he doubted any explanation from him would be truthful, as per CBS news.The court imposed four consecutive life sentences for each of the murders, plus a 10-year prison term for a burglary charge.Kohberger must also pay $50,000 per murder charge and a $5,000 civil penalty to each victim’s family. As part of the plea deal, he has waived his right to appeal and must submit his DNA to authorities.The sentencing followed more than a dozen impact statements from devastated families and friends of the victims: Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen, and Kaylee Goncalves, who were killed in the early hours of 13 November 2022, at an off-campus house in Moscow, Idaho.Kohberger was arrested six weeks after the killings at his parents’ home in Pennsylvania. Prosecutors said they had gathered extensive evidence linking him to the crime scene, including DNA, phone data, surveillance footage of his car, and online purchase records.

Diplomatic relations collapse amid land mine accusations

Thai officials claim the land mines that injured its soldiers were newly planted in Ubon Ratchathani province.

Cambodia has denied the allegation, calling it “baseless” and insisting the blast occurred inside its Preah Vihear province.

“The explosion took place on Cambodian territory,” said Defence Ministry spokesperson Lt. Gen. Maly Socheata.

Border sealed, economic and cultural ties fraying



The crisis has also rocked Thai politics. Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra is under fire after a leaked call with Cambodia’s ex-leader Hun Sen, in which she called him “uncle” and dismissed a Thai commander as someone who “just wanted to look cool”. Critics accused her of undermining the military, and a key coalition partner has since exited her government.





Tensions between Thailand and Cambodia boiled over into violence on Thursday morning, as soldiers from both sides exchanged gunfire near the disputed Prasat Ta Muen Thom temple along their shared border. The Thai army reported that three Thai civilians were injured in the strike.The Cambodian foreign ministry accused Thai troops of firing first, while the Thai army said it returned fire after spotting six armed Cambodian soldiers and hearing a drone overhead.The firefight, which occurred in Surin province (Thailand) and Oddar Meanchey province (Cambodia), was accompanied by blasts that sent local residents fleeing into bunkers. A Thai army statement confirmed that no casualties were reported but added that field artillery had been used in response.The clashes came just hours after Cambodia officially downgraded diplomatic relations with Thailand and recalled its embassy staff from Bangkok.

'Unconstitutional': US appeals court blocks Donald Trump's executive order ending birthright citizenship- What it means,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/unconstitutional-us-appeals-court-blocks-donald-trumps-executive-order-ending-birthright-citizenship-what-it-means/articleshow/122870157.cms,"US President Donald Trump

Birthright Citizenship: Trump Elated As SC Decides To Hear His Case | 'Rooted In Slavery'

What it means for immigrant families?







A US court on Wednesday ruled that President Donald Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship is unconstitutional, implementing a nationwide block on its enforcement.The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a 2-1 ruling, representing the first appellate assessment since the Supreme Court's June decision that restricted lower courts' authority to issue nationwide injunctions on federal policies, Reuters reported.“The district court correctly concluded that the Executive Order’s proposed interpretation, denying citizenship to many persons born in the United States, is unconstitutional. We fully agree,” the majority wrote.The Supreme Court's June 27 verdict on Trump's birthright citizenship order required lower courts to re-evaluate their nationwide blocks. However, certain exceptions remained, allowing courts to potentially reinstate nationwide injunctions. This enabled a New Hampshire judge to halt Trump's order through an injunction covering a nationwide class action.The 9th Circuit's majority determined that the plaintiff states - Washington, Arizona, Illinois and Oregon - warranted a nationwide injunction, as a narrower order would not provide sufficient relief.Washington Attorney General Nick Brown stated, ""The court agrees that the president cannot redefine what it means to be American with the stroke of a pen.""The Trump administration may seek review from a larger 9th Circuit panel or appeal to the Supreme Court. Trump implemented the order on January 20, upon returning to office, as part of his strict immigration stance.On the first day of his second term, President Trump signed an executive order seeking to deny American citizenship to children born in the US to foreigners who are in the country on short-term visas.The order drew a flurry of lawsuits, as most legal experts have said the 14th Amendment — which was ratified in 1868 — automatically offers citizenship to virtually everybody born within the U.S., regardless of their parents' immigration status, with extremely narrow exceptions.Many immigrants who feared losing their citizenship status can now feel reassured. The prospects for their children's future remain secure.The provision of birthright citizenship continues to serve as a crucial protection for numerous Indian American families stuck in green card application queues. This policy, which enables their US-born children to request changes to their parents' immigration status upon turning 21, remains intact.At present, the United States continues to grant citizenship to all infants born within its borders, regardless of their parents' citizenship status.","The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that President Donald Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship is unconstitutional.

Columbia University to pay $200million to settle clash with Trump admin; accepts other demands too: 10 things to know about their deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/columbia-university-to-pay-200million-to-settle-clash-with-trump-admin-accepts-other-demands-too-10-things-to-know-about-their-deal/articleshow/122870727.cms,"Columbia University and Donald Trump

Columbia has accepted various administrative requirements, including restructuring student disciplinary procedures and implementing a federally-endorsed definition of antisemitism in teaching and disciplinary matters involving students critical of Israel. The agreement, which includes no admission of wrongdoing, formalises these changes whilst maintaining university independence, according to Shipman.

In a post on Truth Social, Trump said, ""I am pleased to announce that the Trump Administration has reached a historic agreement with Columbia University. Columbia has agreed to pay a penalty of $200 Million Dollars to the United States Government for violating Federal Law, in addition to over $20 Million to their Jewish employees who were unlawfully targeted and harassed. Columbia has also committed to ending their ridiculous DEI policies, admitting students based ONLY on MERIT, and protecting the Civil Liberties of their students on campus. Numerous other Higher Education Institutions that have hurt so many, and been so unfair and unjust, and have wrongly spent federal money, much of it from our government, are upcoming. It’s a great honor to have been involved, and I want to thank and congratulate Secretary Linda McMahon, and all those who worked with us on this important deal. I also want to thank and commend Columbia University for agreeing to do what is right. I look forward to watching them have a great future in our Country, maybe greater than ever before!""

Education Secretary Linda McMahon described the deal as ""a seismic shift in our nation's fight to hold institutions that accept American taxpayer dollars accountable for antisemitic discrimination and harassment."" ""Columbia's reforms are a roadmap for elite universities that wish to regain the confidence of the American public by renewing their commitment to truth-seeking, merit, and civil debate,"" McMahon stated.

The pact comes after months of uncertainty and fraught negotiations at the more than 270-year-old university. It was among the first targets of Trump’s crackdown on pro-Palestinian campus protests and on colleges that he asserts have allowed Jewish students be threatened and harassed. Columbia’s own antisemitism task force found last summer that Jewish students had faced verbal abuse, ostracism and classroom humiliation during the spring 2024 demonstrations.

The agreement includes previously announced changes from March, such as reviewing Middle East curriculum for balance, strengthening the Institute for Israel and Jewish Studies, and discontinuing programmes that promote unlawful race-based outcomes.

The agreement requires Columbia to question international students about their motivations for studying in America and share information about disciplinary actions involving student visa holders with the government.

The pressure on Columbia began with a series of funding cuts. Then Mahmoud Khalil, a former graduate student who had been a visible figure in the protests, became the first person detained in the Trump administration’s push to deport pro-Palestinian activists who aren’t U.S. citizens.

Columbia was an early test case for the Trump administration as it sought closer oversight of universities that the Republican president views as bastions of liberalism. Yet it soon was overshadowed by Harvard University, which became the first higher education institution to defy Trump’s demands and fight back in court.

The Trump administration has used federal research funding as its primary lever in its campaign to reshape higher education. More than $2 billion in total has also been frozen at Cornell, Northwestern, Brown and Princeton universities.

Columbia's reinstatement for federal research funding marks a significant development. The institution's removal from the federal blacklist enables access to previously frozen grant funds. Scientists at the university can now utilise their approved grants that were suspended. Additionally, the academic community at Columbia regains eligibility to apply for new federal research grants.





Columbia University on Wednesday announced that it agreed to pay over $220 million to the Trump administration to restore federal research funding that was previously cancelled due to concerns about antisemitism on campus.The agreement requires the Ivy League institution to pay $200 million across three years, plus an additional $21 million to address alleged civil rights violations against Jewish staff following the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel.""This agreement marks an important step forward after a period of sustained federal scrutiny and institutional uncertainty,"" acting University President Claire Shipman said.The institution faced potential losses of billions in government support, including over $400 million in cancelled grants. The funding was withdrawn due to the university's alleged inadequate response to antisemitism during the Israel-Hamas conflict.10 things to know more about agreement",Columbia University has agreed to pay $220 million to the Trump administration to restore federal research funding that was previously cancelled due to concerns about antisemitism on campus.

"Tulsi Gabbard's Report Shakes Obama-Era Russia Claims, Fuels Investigation into Intelligence Misconduct",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/explained-how-tulsi-gabbards-house-intelligence-committee-report-challenges-obama-officials-russia-narrative-and-gives-trump-new-ammunition/articleshow/122871475.cms,"Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard

TL;DR



Gabbard has declassified a once-classified House Intelligence Committee report that disputes the 2016 intelligence claim that Putin favoured Trump.

The report argues the original assessment relied on flimsy, biased, and unverifiable intelligence—some of which CIA analysts reportedly tried to block.

Gabbard accuses the Obama administration of orchestrating a politically motivated “manufacturing” of the Russia-Trump narrative.

The Department of Justice has created a dedicated task force to investigate the origins and legality of the intelligence assessment.

The report had been withheld for years due to internal CIA opposition and concerns over revealing sources and methods.

What’s in the Report?



One was the now-discredited Steele Dossier.

Another was an email with no author, recipient, or date.

A third was a sentence fragment that even CIA analysts couldn’t decipher.

The fourth was a mosaic of press clippings, out-of-date liaison intel, and Russian punditry that made no direct mention of Trump.

Why Was It Suppressed?



What Is the Justice Department Doing?



Why It Matters



1. It reframes the entire Russia-Trump narrative

2. It strikes at the credibility of Obama-era intelligence leaders

3. It underscores the risk of politicised intelligence

4. It raises questions about oversight and transparency

5. It revives Trump’s case against the so-called “deep state”

Final Word







There are stories that refuse to stay buried. This one comes wrapped in a manila folder, half-burnt, half-declassified, and now very much a political grenade.This week, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard blew the dust off a long-suppressed House Intelligence Committee report that takes aim at one of the most sacred narratives of American liberal orthodoxy: that Russia wanted Donald Trump to win in 2016. What Gabbard released wasn’t just a report—it was a Molotov cocktail thrown at the edifice of the Obama-era intelligence establishment.The fallout? A Justice Department task force has now been formed to examine whether Obama officials weaponised intelligence to launch what Gabbard calls a “treasonous conspiracy” against Trump. The phrase may be incendiary—but the allegations are dead serious.The document, first drafted in 2017 but buried for years, focuses on four key “evidentiary” pieces that allegedly supported the claim that Putin wanted Trump to win.According to the report:Even Brennan’s handpicked CIA analysts were reportedly uneasy. Two warned that the conclusions about Putin’s motives did not meet standard tradecraft. Their warnings were dismissed. When one raised doubts about the Steele Dossier’s credibility, former CIA Director John Brennan is said to have replied, “Yes, but doesn’t it ring true?”The report itself was compiled by a team of investigators assigned by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence under then-chairman Devin Nunes. The team included career intelligence experts and legal analysts who conducted an exhaustive 2,300-hour review of classified source material, much of it at CIA headquarters. Among the key drafters was Kash Patel , now serving as Trump’s FBI Director.The report underwent multiple revisions through 2020 but was kept classified until Gabbard ordered its release in 2025.This internal dissent was overruled. The resulting Intelligence Community Assessment was published in January 2017 and became the foundation for years of investigations, op-eds, and cable news hysteria. But now, in Gabbard’s telling, it all began with smoke and mirrors.The report was finished in 2017 and updated in 2020, but it never saw the light of day. Intelligence officials, particularly within the CIA, objected to its release on the grounds that it could expose sources and methods. Others within the Office of the Director of National Intelligence reportedly feared it would embarrass senior figures from the Obama era—including Brennan, Clapper, and Comey.It remained locked in a secure facility, reportedly at CIA headquarters, until Gabbard—at Trump’s urging—ordered its release in 2025.The irony, of course, is rich: a report about politicisation being suppressed for political reasons.In a brief but pointed announcement, the Department of Justice confirmed the formation of a new task force to investigate the origins of the 2016 ICA and any unlawful actions tied to its development or dissemination. While the statement avoided inflammatory language, officials privately admit the probe could extend to former intelligence leaders—and even the former president himself.Gabbard has claimed that she has referred specific documents and findings to the FBI. Trump, for his part, has called the revelations “proof of treason.” Aides say further disclosures may follow, depending on how the Justice Department proceeds.For now, the task force is in evidence-gathering mode. But subpoenas, depositions, and closed-door hearings are widely expected in the coming weeks.If the ICA’s core conclusion was politically driven or based on unreliable intel, years of investigations, impeachments, and prosecutions are thrown into question.Comey, Brennan, Clapper—all played key roles in shaping public understanding of the Russia probe. This report casts a shadow over their decisions and internal judgment.The line between analysis and advocacy is supposed to be sacred. If Gabbard’s accusations hold, that line was obliterated.Why was a congressional report hidden from the public for nearly eight years? And what else remains under lock and key?Just as the Epstein files threatened to swamp him, Trump now has a new narrative: he was the victim of a fabricated intelligence coup.In a blistering thread, journalist Matt Taibbi draws a direct parallel between the Steele Dossier and the Iraq War’s false WMD claims, alleging that U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials knowingly pushed flawed information to damage Donald Trump. According to Taibbi, FBI analysts were ordered to “push” the Steele material despite raising concerns about its credibility. When confronted about its flaws, CIA Director John Brennan reportedly brushed them aside with the comment, “Yes, but doesn’t it ring true?” FBI Director James Comey insisted the dossier was “important” enough to include in official briefings. Taibbi highlights how James Clapper, who previously admitted to finding things that “weren’t really there” during the Iraq WMD fiasco, played a similar role in amplifying the dossier’s claims. Taibbi argues this was not just a case of bad intelligence but a deliberate, coordinated effort to mislead—one that ruined reputations, sowed division, and paralyzed the country, all based on what now appears to have been a demonstrable lie.Yes. The new report does not challenge the existence of interference—it questions the claim that Putin had a “clear preference” for Trump.Politically, perhaps. Legally, not necessarily. But it does challenge the legitimacy of the foundational intelligence that led to years of investigations.Though officials now claim it played no role in the ICA’s analytic judgments, the report reveals that it was cited in the classified annex and used to shape the context of the assessment.Yes. The report suggests multiple analysts raised concerns about the dossier and other evidence. Brennan overruled them.Expect subpoenas, hearings, and intense media crossfire. Trump allies are already calling for charges against Brennan and Comey. Obama’s role will likely come under scrutiny.For years, critics of the Russia-Trump narrative were dismissed as conspiracy theorists. With Tulsi Gabbard’s release of the suppressed report and the Justice Department now on the case, the conspiracy may have finally become the headline. The question is no longer whether Russia interfered—but whether America’s own intelligence agencies played politics with the truth.","Tulsi Gabbard declassified a once-classified House Intelligence Committee report that disputes the 2016 intelligence claim that Putin favoured Trump.

Stalin as a Jew

Does Owens support Trump?

If you've spent any time online, you’ve likely encountered Candace Owens , a far-right commentator known for promoting conspiracy theories that are often more extreme than those espoused by Donald Trump and his MAGA supporters. Many of her theories have antisemitic undertones, alongside secular beliefs like flat Earth theories or denying that an asteroid caused the extinction of the dinosaurs.Among her more antisemitic claims are the beliefs that Israel was involved in 9/11, that the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) was founded to protect a Jewish paedophile, that Stalin and Mustafa Kemal Ataturk were secretly Jewish, and that a covert group of Hollywood Jews orchestrated Michael Jackson’s death. She has also propagated anti-Christian conspiracy theories, such as claiming that the US bombed Nagasaki to target Christians, that elite Jews follow a secret religion called Frankism (based on the teachings of Jacob Frank), and that they were responsible for the Russian and French revolutions to ""bring down Christian empires.""Candace Owens has floated several conspiracy theories about Jews, many of which have drawn significant criticism.Here’s an overview of the key ones:: Owens has bizarrely claimed that Joseph Stalin, the Soviet dictator, was secretly Jewish, despite overwhelming historical evidence to the contrary. This claim is part of her broader pattern of using baseless theories to connect Jewish people to major world events in a negative light.Candace Owens's relationship with Donald Trump has been a significant aspect of her rise in conservative media and politics. Owens first gained widespread attention during the 2016 presidential campaign when she embraced conservative values and aligned herself with Trump, whose critique of the mainstream media resonated with her personal experiences. Her outspoken support for Trump, especially as a Black woman in a political movement often accused of racism, made her a unique and controversial figure, helping her to build a substantial following.Owens's public support for Trump was characterized by her defence of his policies and rhetoric, particularly on issues like race, media bias, and nationalism. She often praised Trump for his bluntness and willingness to challenge the political establishment, which aligned with her own combative style. This alignment with Trump helped Owens secure a prominent place in the conservative movement, leading to her association with organizations like Turning Point USA and eventually her role at The Daily Wire.In December 2021, Owens conducted a sit-down interview with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, which further cemented her status as a significant voice in the conservative media landscape. During the interview, Trump defended the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, a position that contrasted with Owens’s own scepticism about vaccines. This difference of opinion led Owens to suggest that Trump’s views on vaccines were influenced by his age and the era he grew up in, implying that he might not be as informed on the issue as her audience would expect.Following the interview, Owens faced backlash for her comments about Trump’s age and understanding of vaccines. Reports indicated that Trump was displeased with Owens’s remarks, leading to a brief cooling of their relationship. Owens even publicly questioned Trump’s relevance and vision for a potential 2024 presidential run after the Republican Party's disappointing performance in the 2022 midterms.However, despite these tensions, Owens's overall support for Trump remained intact, though her relationship with him has seen fluctuations. By early 2024, Owens appeared to have warmed back up to Trump, expressing mistrust towards his main political rival, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. This demonstrates the complex and sometimes strained nature of her relationship with Trump, marked by both strong support and moments of disagreement.In essence, Owens’s relationship with Trump has been foundational to her identity in conservative media, helping to propel her into the spotlight. While there have been moments of friction, particularly over issues like the COVID-19 vaccine, Owens has largely remained a supporter of Trump, aligning with his broader political vision and continuing to engage with his base.","Candace Owens is a far-right commentator known for promoting conspiracy theories.

VASAI: The body of a 32-year-old man was found buried in his house at Nalasopara (east) Monday evening. His wife is missing, the police said. The cellphone of the man, Vijay Chauhan, had been switched off for almost three weeks which prompted his brothers to visit the chawl where he lived.A set of newly laid floor tiles in one corner of the house, and the whereabouts of the wife, Chaman Devi (28) being not known raised the family's suspicion, the police said.Curiously, a 20-year-old man from their neighbuorhood has also been missing for a few days, the police said, clarifying that they are not sure if the missing man has anything to do with the case at hand.The brothers of the dead man, who also live in the same locality, had visited his house on July 10 as he could not be reached on phone.

Neighbours told them that the sister-in-law had not been seen for at least two days. The brothers then entered the house, to find no one in there.""But they got suspicious on seeing new floor tiles in one corner,"" said an officer.A few neighbours were called.

However, the incident triggered panic among villagers, who allege illegal and heavy blasting in the area by mining contractors.According to reports, the region had been experiencing intermittent rainfall since Tuesday night.At around 5am on Wednesday, heavy showers resumed. Shortly afterward, villagers noticed unusual movements in a hill near the village.Acting quickly, they moved to a safe distance — moments later, a large section of the hill crumbled with a thunderous noise, sending up a thick cloud of dust and shaking the nearby area.Villagers allege that the hill has been extensively mined in violation of regulations.Some residents claimed that tremors from the landslide were felt in surrounding areas. There are also claims that a nearby government school building has developed cracks, possibly due to the repeated blasting and the recent collapse.Following the incident, Chirawa tehsildar Kamaldeep Poonia visited the site and assessed the situation.

Merz signals 'decisions' on EU-US trade row

Row over a joint next-generation fighter project

What are the other major disagreements?





German Chancellor Friedrich Merz held talks with French President Emmanuel Macron in Berlin on Wednesday, as both sides sought to boost relations amid challenging global political times.It was Macron's first visit to Germany since Merz's government took power in early May. Merz hosted the French president for a dinner at the lakeside Villa Borsig outside Berlin on Wednesday evening.The leaders said they wanted to deepen Franco-German cooperation ""at all levels.""""We stand on the foundation of a close Franco-German friendship that has developed over decades. And we both feel a great obligation to continue working on this in the coming years,"" Merz said at the start of Macron's working visit to Berlin.Macron highlighted the personal friendship between him and Merz, as well as between their two countries.The Franco-German relationship and the shared will to advance both bilateral and European agendas are essential, said the French president.The meeting comes as the EU confronts a raft of geopolitical and economic challenges, including a trade conflict with the US and Russia's continuing war against Ukraine, among others.Paris and Berlin have been increasing efforts to support Ukraine against Russia and build up the defense capabilities of NATO's European member states.Both France and Germany are, meanwhile, facing threats of increased tariffs from Washington, with US President Donald Trump threatening to slap 30% tariffs against the EU if no trade deal is reached by August 1.Speaking alongside Macron, Merz said there ""may be decisions"" on the ongoing trade row.""We will discuss some very current issues together, including the current trade policy, about which we are hearing in these minutes that there could possibly be decisions,"" the German chancellor said.Macron said he would coordinate with Merz and other European counterparts on how to respond to the incoming US tariffs.""Today, we are responding to the tariff offensive that has been launched with a determination that we share: to provide stability and have the lowest possible tariffs,"" he said ahead of his meeting with Merz.The two leaders were also expected to discuss several thorny issues, ranging from joint defense projects to energy.There has been disagreement over a combat aircraft to be made jointly by France, Germany and Spain.The planned fifth-generation fighter jet is expected to start replacing French Rafale and German and Spanish Eurofighters from 2040.But the project, worth more than €100 billion ($117.73 billion), has been dogged by delays and infighting over workshare and intellectual property rights.The head of French defense company Dassault, Eric Trappier, on Tuesday suggested that the viability of the project was in doubt.Merz and Macron agreed on Wednesday to try to resolve differences over the FCAS fighter jet project by the end of August, a German government spokesperson said.There are also other disagreements between the neighboring countries.Paris, for instance, is pushing for joint European debt to boost the bloc's defense industry — a proposal Berlin rejects.France also relies heavily on nuclear energy, while Germany has phased it out entirely.Paris wants Berlin to commit to ""technology neutrality"" and effectively classify nuclear energy as climate-friendly. While the previous German government rejected this push, Merz's administration may be more open to the idea.France and Germany also disagree on the trade agreement between the EU and the Latin American Mercosur countries.","Merz signals 'decisions' on EU-US trade row.

'An attack on our right to worship'

Indian man targeted in racist attack





A Hindu temple in Melbourne’s eastern suburb of Boronia was defaced with racist graffiti this week prompting widespread condemnation and police investigation.As reported by The Brisbane Times and The Sydney Morning Herald, offensive red graffiti with the words “Go home” and other racial slurs were found daubed across the Shree Swaminarayan Temple on Wadhurst Drive, as well as two nearby Asian-operated restaurants Kingsland Chinese Restaurant and Charles King Dumpling.Police said a healing centre on Mountain Highway was also defaced the same night, bringing the total number of sites attacked to four. “There is absolutely no place at all in our society for hate-based and racist behaviour,” Victoria Police said in a statement. Authorities confirmed that all four incidents are being treated as linked and that an investigation is under way.Makrand Bhagwat, President of the Hindu Council of Australia’s Victoria chapter, told Australia Today the vandalism of the temple was “heartbreaking” for the community. “Our temple is meant to be a sanctuary of peace, devotion and unity,” he said. “To have it targeted in this way feels like an attack on our identity, our right to worship and freedom of religion.”Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan sent a personal message of support to temple management. “What happened this week was hateful, racist and deeply disturbing,” she wrote. “It wasn’t just vandalism – it was a deliberate act of hate, designed to intimidate, isolate, and spread fear.”Local interfaith networks, including the City of Greater Knox’s Multifaith Network, have expressed support. “We want to show that love and solidarity triumph over hate,” said community leader Vikrant Thakur.This came after a 23-year-old Indian man, Charanpreet Singh, was brutally attacked and left unconscious on a street in Adelaide following a reported racist assault linked to a parking dispute. According to 9News, the men allegedly told Singh to ""f--- off, Indian"" before launching a violent, unprovoked assault.“They just said ‘f--- off, Indian’, and after that they just started punching,” Singh said. “I tried to fight back, but they beat me until I was unconscious.”He sustained serious injuries, including brain trauma and facial fractures. A 20-year-old from Enfield was arrested and charged, but others involved remain at large.","Shree Swaminarayan Temple in Melbourne's eastern suburb of Boronia was defaced with racist graffiti this week.

Ukraine Anti-Govt Protests Spread To Other Cities After Kyiv Erupted In Rage Against Zelensky

What was the final straw that made the Huffmans leave US?



Father’s Day video message







An American man who left US in search of traditional values has ended up on the front lines of Russia’s war in Ukraine.Derek Huffman moved with his wife and three daughters from Texas to a village outside Moscow earlier this year, reports New York Post.Huffman hoped to raise his family away from what he described as the “wokeness” and “LGBTQ indoctrination” of the US education system.However, he now finds himself near the front lines, despite initially being promised a non-combat role. Huffman had joined the Russian military to secure fast-tracked citizenship.Huffman's wife, DeAnna, said in a YouTube video that he was misled during the recruitment process. The video is now deleted from social media.“He feels like he’s being thrown to the wolves right now, and he’s kind of having to lean on faith, and that’s what we’re all doing,” she said. She added that he had no military experience and was trained in Russian, which he barely understands.“Unfortunately, when you’re taught in a different language, and you don’t understand the language, how are you really getting taught? You’re not,” she said.The family had moved to Istra, about 25 miles from Moscow, under Russia’s “shared values” visa scheme.The family was among only two known to have relocated to the so-called “American village,” a settlement created by US expat and blogger Tim Kirby to attract Westerners tired of liberal norms.Their decision to move followed an incident at their daughter’s school in the US. “The final straw was when we found out my daughter Sophia learnt about lesbians from a girl in her class. She didn’t fully understand it, but for us, that was enough to realise something had to change,” Huffman was quoted as saying by Russia Today.The family was later featured in several Russian state-affiliated media outlets, where Huffman said he wanted to earn respect through military service. “The point of this act for me is to earn a place here in Russia. If I risk myself for our new country, no one will say that I am not a part of it. Unlike migrants in America who come there just like that, do not assimilate, and at the same time want free handouts,” he said.Despite these intentions, DeAnna now claims that her husband was offered roles such as a welder or war correspondent but was instead rushed through training and sent to the battlefield. She also said the family has yet to receive any of the promised military wages.In June, Huffman appeared in a Father’s Day video message wearing camouflage. “I miss you all more than you can imagine,” he told his family. “Just know I will do whatever it takes to be safe and to come home to you. Take care of each other.”A Telegram group titled “Save that little girls” was recently linked to the family’s deleted channel, calling on the US government to intervene.“It’s been just a few months since our family made the big move from America to Russia, and while we’ve had amazing adventures, this journey has also brought deep challenges,” DeAnna said. “Being alone in a new country, raising kids, and trying to stay strong has tested me in ways I never imagined.”","Derek Huffman moved with his wife and three daughters from Texas to a village outside Moscow earlier this year.

Trump's AI action plan: US president signs executive orders; seeks to make America leader in artificial intelligence race,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-ai-action-plan-us-president-signs-executive-orders-seeks-to-make-america-leader-in-artificial-intelligence-race/articleshow/122869113.cms,"



US President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed three sweeping executive orders aimed at reshaping America’s artificial intelligence landscape, most notably taking direct aim at what the White House described as “woke” AI models.The orders are part of Trump’s broader campaign against diversity initiatives and come as he pledges to make the US an “AI export powerhouse”.Speaking at an AI summit in Washington, he said that the world is now, whether we like it or not, in a rapid race to develop and shape a revolutionary technology, one that will play a defining role in the future of civilisation, thanks to the brilliance and creativity coming out of Silicon Valley.""America is the country that started the AI race and as president of the United States, I am here today to declare that America is going to win it.""""We are going to work hard. We are going to win it,"" Trump said.He added that the US will not allow any other nation to beat it and ""children will now live on a planet controlled by the algorithms.""The executive orders include, acrackdown on so-called “woke” AI, streamlining federal permits for datacentre infrastructure and directive to boost American AI exports.These actions were unveiled alongside a 24-page “AI Action Plan”, titled Winning the Race, which outlines the administration’s roadmap for accelerating AI adoption across federal agencies and cementing US leadership in the field.The document replaces a previous Biden-era executive order that had introduced regulatory standards and safeguards for AI, as per The Guardian.“Winning this competition will be a test of our capacities unlike anything since the dawn of the space age,” Trump said, urging American tech companies to “put America first”.However, what counts as political bias in AI is still unclear and debated, which has raised concerns that the government might use these new powers to unfairly go after certain companies.The Trump also suggested rebranding the very name of the technology. “I don’t even like the name, you know? I don’t like anything that’s artificial. So could we straighten that out, please? We should change the name. I actually mean that,” he said. “It’s not artificial. It’s genius.”At the summit, he declared, “The American people do not want woke Marxist lunacy in the AI models, and neither do other countries.”A second executive order focuses on deregulating AI development and accelerating the construction of datacentres, often massive, resource-intensive facilities that power AI models. This includes rolling back environmental protections that might obstruct such projects, The Guardian reported.While datacentres are essential for hosting AI infrastructure, they consume vast amounts of energy and water and are major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. Environmental groups have raised alarms over rising air and noise pollution, and some communities have resisted the expansion of these facilities in their neighbourhoods.Despite this, Trump’s order supports long-standing demands from tech firms to ease permitting laws and ramp up energy infrastructure. It also frames AI development as a matter of geopolitical urgency, pointing to China’s heavy investments in AI chips and datacentres. Companies like Deepseek have emerged as formidable challengers to Silicon Valley’s dominance.The administration’s offensive against “woke” AI reflects deeper ideological tensions. Conservatives have increasingly shifted their criticism from social media moderation to generative AI tools, accusing them of suppressing right-wing viewpoints.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also lauded the order, citing the advantage of having Donald Trump as the president.""America’s unique advantage that no other country can possibly have is President Trump,"" television host Ed Ludlow quoted Huang. The tweet was later shared by the US president.","US President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed three sweeping executive orders aimed at reshaping America’s artificial intelligence landscape. The orders include, acrackdown on so-called “woke” AI, streamlining federal permits for datacentre infrastructure and directive to boost American AI exports.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122869568,imgsize-2368562,width-400,resizemode-4/122869568.jpg"
Trump vs AP: Court lets US president block Associated Press from key spaces; ‘Gulf of America’ order dispute widens,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-vs-ap-court-lets-us-president-block-associated-press-from-key-spaces-gulf-of-america-order-dispute-widens/articleshow/122869667.cms,"Trump Bans Associated Press, Outrage Ensues: Press Freedom Under Attack In U.S.?





US President Donald Trump won a temporary legal victory allowing him to continue restricting media access to certain spaces such as the Oval Office and Air Force One.A federal appeals court in Washington, DC, has upheld an earlier ruling that enables White House officials to exclude the Associated Press (AP) from the rotating pool of journalists covering the president’s day-to-day activities, at least while the broader legal battle continues.The US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, on Tuesday, declined to overturn a previous decision that permitted the White House to limit AP’s participation, as per Bloomberg.The case remains ongoing, but the court’s move is seen as a win for Trump and his senior aides, who have long pushed for greater control over which media outlets get access to him.The appeals court, which currently has a majority of judges appointed by Democratic presidents, did not record any dissents from its 11 active judges, signalling an uphill battle for AP in case it choose to escalate the case to the US Supreme Court. That court holds a conservative majority, which may be less inclined to side with the press.“We are disappointed by today’s procedural decision but remain focused on the strong district court opinion in support of free speech as we have our case heard,” said AP spokesperson Lauren Easton.“The press and the public have a fundamental right to speak freely without government retaliation. We look forward to continuing to produce strong, factual and nonpartisan coverage of the administration.”In contrast, White House spokesperson Harrison Fields welcomed the ruling, sharply criticising the news agency.“AP’s outrageous, self-absorbed actions are an embarrassment to journalism” and that “the Trump administration is the most accessible and transparent in history.”The AP filed its lawsuit in February after the White House press office began restricting access for its reporters and photographers. The administration claimed the agency was being excluded because it had refused to adopt President Trump’s executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico as the “Gulf of America,” a change AP did not reflect in its widely used style guide.In April, a federal district judge in Washington ordered the White House to reinstate the AP’s place in the press pool. However, that order was largely blocked in June by a three-judge panel of the DC Circuit, although the AP retained access to the White House’s East Room, which is typically open to a broader press group.The AP had requested a full review of the panel’s decision by all active judges of the appeals court, but Tuesday’s order left the panel’s ruling largely intact.","The US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, on Tuesday, declined to overturn a previous decision that permitted the White House to limit AP’s participation.

US President Donald Trump pulled out America from Unesco over its support for ""woke, divisive cultural and social causes"" including DEI policies, pro-Palestinian and pro-China tilt.""Continued involvement in Unesco is not in the national interest of the United States,"" AFP reported quoting state department spokeswoman.Back in February, Trump had directed a 90-day review of the US role in Unesco, focusing particularly on examining any “anti-Semitism or anti-Israel sentiment within the organization.”""Upon conducting the review, administration officials took issue with Unesco’s diversity, equity and inclusion policies as well as its pro-Palestinian and pro-China bias,"" the New York Post reported citing White House official.“China has leveraged its influence over Unesco to advance global standards that are favorable to Beijing’s interests,” the official said.“President Trump has decided to withdraw the United States from Unesco – which supports woke, divisive cultural and social causes that are totally out-of-step with the commonsense policies that Americans voted for in November,” White House deputy spokesperson Anna Kelly said.“This President will always put America First and ensure our country’s membership in all international organizations aligns with our national interests,” Kelly added.Critics have pointed to Unesco’s 2023 release of an “anti-racism toolkit” and its 2024 “Transforming MEN’talities” campaign as examples behind Trump's concern. The toolkit urged member states to embrace “anti-racist” policies and engage in a “race to the top” to position themselves as leading voices for social justice, by confronting their histories of racism and committing to equity-driven reforms.The States initially pulled out of the UN agency in 1983 during the then President Ronald Reagan’s administration, arguing that Unesco had overly politicized nearly every issue it addressed, shown clear antagonism toward free societies, particularly free markets and a free press, and engaged in unchecked budgetary growth.","US President Donald Trump pulled out America from Unesco over its support for ""woke, divisive cultural and social causes"" The States initially pulled out of the UN agency in 1983 during the then President Ronald Reagan’s administration.

Who is Justice department backed Alina Habba?

Who is Federal Judges' choice Desiree Leigh Grace?





The New Jersey US attorney's office was in embroiled in confusion and chaos on Tuesday when top Justice Department officials contested federal judges' appointment of a new US attorney.The federal judges dismissed Alina Habba's request to maintain her position and exercised their unusual authority to select Desiree Leigh Grace, an experienced prosecutor whom Habba had previously appointed as her first assistant in March.However, Attorney General Pam Bondi issued a social media statement supporting Habba, announcing that Grace ""has just been removed."" Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, criticised the judges' actions, suggesting collusion with New Jersey's Democratic senators.Grace received notification of her termination via email on Tuesday, according to a source familiar with the situation, according to New York Times. This swift series of events could escalate into another full-blown clash between the Trump administration and federal judiciary.The judges' ruling, following a private vote on Monday, challenged Trump's emphasis on loyalty within the Justice Department. Despite Grace's potential appointment requiring adherence to Washington's Justice officials, Tuesday's response indicated resistance to leadership not directly chosen by the president.Chief Judge Renée Marie Bumb, a George W. Bush nominee, signed Grace's appointment order. After Grace's dismissal, Bumb's office stated ""the court will have no comment.""Grace's career in the Newark office began in 2016, progressing from acting chief of violent crimes in August 2020 to criminal division chief in March 2024.Habba, aged 41, served as one of President Trump's foremost legal allies, representing him in multiple high-profile civil and criminal cases. In 2023, she became counsel to Trump's Save America PAC and subsequently joined his inner circle as “counsellor to the president.”Born in Summit, New Jersey, Habba graduated from Kent Place School in 2002. She obtained a bachelor’s degree from Lehigh University and a law degree from Widener University Commonwealth Law School. Before working with Trump, she specialised in civil litigation and corporate law in private practice. Habba also clerked for Judge Eugene J Codey Jr. at the Civil Division of the Superior Court in Newark and was formerly the managing partner at Habba Madaio & Associates in Bedminster.A mother of three, Habba described herself at the Republican National Convention in July as a “devout Catholic, a proud first-generation Arab American woman and a feisty Jersey girl.”Desiree Leigh Grace, known as “Desi” to colleagues, is a seasoned federal prosecutor who joined the US attorney’s office for the District of New Jersey in 2016.A graduate of the University of Maryland and Seton Hall Law School, Grace quickly rose through the ranks, leading the violent crimes unit in 2020 and later the criminal division, which she officially headed by March 2024, according to NYT.She has handled major cases involving gang violence and health care fraud and received a standing ovation at a 2024 alumni dinner, underscoring her respect within the legal community.Before joining the government, she clerked for top judges and worked at McCarter & English. In April 2025, Trump-appointed interim US attorney Alina Habba named Grace as her first assistant, a move widely supported within the office.(This is a top Google Trends topic.)",Federal judges dismissed Alina Habba's request to maintain her position.

In a 6–3 ruling on Wednesday, the US supreme court sided with president Donald Trump in a case concerning the removal of three Democratic members from the consumer product safety commission (CPSC). The ruling allows Trump to go ahead with the dismissals, overturning earlier decisions from a federal judge and an appeals court that had reinstated the board members.The three officials Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, and Richard Trumka Jr, were removed from the CPSC by the Trump administration. They were later reinstated by US district judge Matthew Maddox, who ruled the firings unlawful. Maddox, a Biden appointee, said that the structure of the independent agency did not violate Trump’s constitutional powers under Article II.Trump’s legal team challenged the ruling in the supreme court, arguing that the president had the authority to remove members of independent boards. The administration cited a recent decision involving other federal bodies the national labour relations board (NLRB) and the merit systems protection board (MSPB) to claim the precedent applied here too.The three ousted members opposed the emergency appeal, pointing out that their sudden removal would harm the functioning of the CPSC and lacked any clear urgency, especially since the administration had waited four months to act.Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented from the ruling.","The US supreme court sided with president Donald Trump in a case concerning the removal of three Democratic members from the consumer product safety commission.

A federal judge in Florida on Wednesday refused to unseal grand jury records from earlier Jeffrey Epstein investigations, dismissing a request made by the Trump administration.US district judge Robin Rosenberg ruled that the grand jury material from 2005 and 2007 did not meet any of the exceptions under US law that would allow it to be released to the public.Department of justice (DOJ) had filed the request last week, claiming transparency was necessary to address growing speculation among supporters of Donald Trump. Many of them believe there was a deliberate effort to hide the identities of Epstein’s clients and suppress evidence, including alleged videos of abuse.In 2008, Epstein reached a plea deal with federal prosecutors in Florida, avoiding major federal charges by pleading guilty to lesser state crimes involving underage prostitution.Deputy attorney general Todd Blanche had also asked courts in both Florida and New York to unseal grand jury transcripts from indictments against Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell . He argued the public had a right to know the full extent of the case.Epstein was arrested again in 2019 on sex trafficking charges but died in a New York jail a month later. His death was ruled a suicide. Maxwell was later convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison.","US district judge Robin Rosenberg ruled that the grand jury material from 2005 and 2007 did not meet any of the exceptions under US law that would allow it to be released to the public.

He added that Sher Baz Satakzai, the tribal chief, ordered the execution. Police have arrested 14 people in connection with the case, though it remains unclear if the brother is among them, according to Reuters.Chief minister Bugti said the man and woman both had children from previous marriages and were accused of having an affair out of wedlock.
