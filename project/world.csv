Trump's 20-Point Gaza Peace Plan



Gaza will be transformed into a demilitarized, terror-free zone with no threat to neighbors. The region will be redeveloped to improve the lives of Gazans, AFP reported. If both sides accept, the war will stop immediately, Israeli forces will pull back, and hostages will be prepared for release. Within 72 hours of Israel’s approval, all hostages—alive or deceased—will be returned. After hostages are freed, Israel will release 250 prisoners serving life sentences and 1,700 Gazans detained after October 7, 2023, including women and children. For each deceased Israeli hostage, Israel will return 15 Gazan remains. Hamas members who disarm and commit to peace will be granted amnesty, while others can leave Gaza with safe passage. Full humanitarian aid will immediately flow into Gaza, covering infrastructure repair, hospitals, bakeries, and rubble clearance. Aid delivery will be managed by the UN, Red Crescent, and neutral international agencies, with Rafah crossing opened under agreed terms. Gaza will be run temporarily by a technocratic Palestinian committee, overseen by a new international “Board of Peace” chaired by Trump, until the Palestinian Authority reforms and takes over. An economic plan will be launched to rebuild Gaza with input from global experts, attracting investment and creating jobs. A special economic zone with preferential trade terms will be created for Gaza. No one will be forced to leave Gaza; people may leave or return freely, with incentives to stay and rebuild. Hamas and other factions will have no role in governance. Gaza will be fully demilitarized, with weapons destroyed under international monitoring and buyback programs. Regional partners will guarantee Hamas and other groups comply, ensuring Gaza remains threat-free. A temporary International Stabilization Force (ISF), supported by Arab and global partners, will deploy in Gaza, training Palestinian police and securing borders with Egypt and Israel. Israel will not annex Gaza. As security improves, the IDF will withdraw gradually, handing control to the ISF, except for a limited security perimeter. If Hamas rejects or delays, aid and redevelopment will still proceed in areas controlled by the ISF and free from terror. An interfaith dialogue program will promote tolerance, coexistence, and peace narratives among Israelis and Palestinians. Once Gaza is rebuilt and the Palestinian Authority reforms, conditions may allow progress toward Palestinian self-determination and eventual statehood. The US will foster Israel-Palestine talks to set a long-term political framework for peaceful coexistence and prosperity.

Khalistani Leader Pannun Cornered: NIA Files New Case After Aide Gosal’s Arrest Over Terror Links

Transnational organised crime is a concern for India & Canada, says govt

NEW DELHI: While Canadian police focus on tackling the Bishnoi syndicate, pro-Khalistan elements attempted arson at a cinema theatre in Ontario twice within a week. The theatre has stopped screening Hindi movies since. The attacks were carried out on Oct 2 and Sept 25. In the second incident, the suspects fired gunshots to cause a scare.Designated terror group Sikhs For Justice (SFJ) released a statement on Friday calling on the Carney govt to ban all “Made In India” films.In the first incident, two masked suspects wearing black clothing attempted to ignite a fire at the theatre’s entrance using flammable liquid from red gas cans, CCTV footage released by Khalistani elements shows. The fire was contained outside, causing moderate damage. This happened at 5.30am on Sept 25.On Oct 2, around 1.50am, a single suspect, described by local police as a heavy-built male wearing black and a face mask, fired multiple shots at the theatre’s entrance doors.Halton Regional Police said they were probing both incidents as targeted attacks.The threatre’s CEO Jeff Knoll linked the attacks to the screening of south Asian films, adding that due to safety concerns, it had halted the screenings of Indian films ‘Kantara: A Legend Chapter 1’ and ‘They Call Him OG’.SFJ chief Pannun claimed “Make in India” was no longer a cultural label but had become a political weapon for Modi’s regime. “Every screening and every product stamped ‘Made in India’ carries the imprint of a violent ideology that is driving India toward a Hindutva totalitarian state,” he said . Allowing Indian films and products into Canadian markets, he warned, was equivalent to opening the door to propaganda that normalises violence against pro-Khalistan Sikhs and undermines the values enshrined in Canada’s Charter.India and Canada had productive talks in the recent NSA-level meeting on advancing the bilateral relationship in areas such as counter terrorism, combating transnational organised crime and intelligence exchanges, said the govt responding to queries on Ottawa’s listing of the Bishnoi gang as a terrorist entity.MEA said security cooperation is an important agenda of continued bilateral collaboration. “Transnational organised crime is a particular concern to both countries. All countries, in fact, must come together to fight this menace,” said MEA spokesman Randhir Jaiswal. “They agreed to strengthen security cooperation and further reinforce existing mechanisms of engagement.”",Pro-Khalistan elements attempted arson at a cinema theatre in Ontario twice within a week.

NEW DELHI: A scuffle broke out between ABVP and Left-affiliated outfits and charges and counter-charges were traded in JNU over a Ravan Dahan and a Durga immersion on Thursday.The Leftist outfits alleged that an effigy of former students Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam - who are facing trial in a 2020 Delhi riots case - along with Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru, was burnt during a Ravan Dahan. They accused ABVP of communal propaganda. ABVP, on the other hand, alleged that its Durga immersion procession was attacked.Videos from the campus showed groups of students raising slogans and flashing slippers, while security personnel formed a chain to prevent an escalation.TOI was unable to independently confirm the details of the two events.ABVP said the effigy burning was symbolic of the end of ""Naxalism, Leftism, Maoist violence and anti-national ideologies"". Khalid, Imam, Guru and Naxal movement leaders Charu Mazumdar and Kanu Sanyal had replaced Ravan's heads. ABVP, on the other hand, said the Left groups threw stones and abused students at the Durga Visarjan.

This clearly indicates that there is something fishy.""He further urged the government to bring ""truth and reality"" in front of the country, saying, ""the whole matter should be clarified.""His statement followed Air Force chief Amar Preet Singh's remarks dismissing Pakistan's claims of shooting down Indian fighter jets during Operation Sindoor, calling them ""Manohar Kahaniyan.""Singh, who was addressing the press conference on the 93rd Air Force Day celebrations in New Delhi, said Pakistan has no evidence to support its claim, while India had shared images of damage caused to Pakistani targets during Operation Sindoor.He further said that the Pakistani government is making such claims to save face and mislead its public.Pakistan have repeatedly claimed that it downed several Indian fighter jets during Operation Sindoor.""If they think they shot down 15 of my jets, let them think about it.

(With ANI inputs)

CHENNAI: Criticising actor-politician Vijay and his Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) members for first causing a stampede that killed 41 people in Karur on Sept 27, and then abandoning their cadres and followers, Madras HC ordered a probe by an SIT Friday.Citing two accidents involving Vijay’s campaign vehicle, which did not stop even after dashing against the bikes of his accompanying cadres, HC also ordered registration of a hit-and-run case against the politician. “Both the driver and the leader (Vijay) saw the accident but left the place without stopping... This court highly condemns the attitude of the party (TVK)... There was not even a remote sense of feeling expressed by the party taking responsibility for organising such an event. This only shows the mental state of the leader and the party,” Justice N Senthilkumar said.“The SIT will be headed by Asra Garg, IGP (north zone), and comprise Vimala, SP, Namakkal, & Shyamaladevi, SP. Garg is at liberty to select additional members under any category/designation as he deems fit,” said the judge. All CCTV footage from place of the incident, and in particular footage inside and outside the bus carrying the head of the political party, shall be seized.The bus involved shall also be seized, the court said.“In both cases (campaign vehicle hitting two bikes), police have not registered an FIR for hit-and-run. Court expresses its deep anguish and agony that even if no complaint is filed by the aggrieved, state has suo motu responsibility to register a case, bring the perpetrators of the crime on record, and make them face trial,” Justice Senthilkumar said.“Neither the politician nor his followers were there at the scene of occurrence after the incident. The President, the PM, Union home minister, CM of Tamil Nadu , and leader of opposition condoled the incident. This court could not understand how the political party that organised the rally abandoned the scene of occurrence immediately after the incident,” the judge said.“Unfortunately, the organisers, right from the leader... vanished, leaving their own cadres, leaving their own followers, leaving their own fans in the lurch,” the judge said, adding, “Such irresponsible attitude of any politician or organisation can’t be taken lightly. Court owes its responsibility towards its citizens. It is unfortunate to record such leadership quality.”Court prohibited political rallies, roadshows and similar public events along state and national highways in the state until standard operating procedures were formulated.HC also dismissed the anticipatory bail petitions of two TVK members, state general secretary Bussy N Anand and deputy general secretary CTR Nirmal Kumar, who have been named in the FIR in connection with the incident.","Madras HC orders probe by an SIT Friday.

The observation came Monday in response to a PIL registered suo motu by division bench of Chief Justice Ramesh Sinha and Justice Bibhu Datta Guru over poor state of Muktidham (cremation ground) in Bilaspur’s Rahngi gram panchayat. The pronouncement followed the CJ’s visit to the site for a funeral on Sept 28 when he found the facility in a “pathetic condition”.The bench said a body “deserves a respectable send-off” and the State had a constitutional obligation to provide decent conditions at public funeral facilities. Failure to do so amounted to an abdication of duty. The CJ found several glaring deficiencies, including absence of fencing to demarcate the area, lack of proper road, no sanitation, lighting, shed, or seating for mourners and absence of caretaker, signboard, or helpline.The bench issued an 11-point directive and asked administration to immediately undertake corrective measures, including comprehensive cleaning drives at all cremation/funeral grounds, fencing, installation of water, electricity, toilets, shelters, and seating, provision of firewood/LPG, and functional electric/gas crematoria. HC asked panchayat and social welfare department secretary, chief secretary, and Bilaspur collector to file personal affidavits on state’s roadmap for improving cremation grounds.

Police Lathicharge Protesters After Violence Breaks Out In Bareilly During ‘I Love Muhammad’ March

Govt using police to silence victims, oppn: Bhim Army chief

MEERUT/BAREILLY: Internet services, including mobile data, broadband and SMS services, were suspended across Bareilly on Thursday afternoon amid fears of unrest on Friday when people will gather to offer juma namaz. According to a govt notification, internet services will remain suspended in Bareilly from 3 pm on Oct 2 to 3 pm on Oct 4.Security has been tightened across four districts in Bareilly division, with heavy deployment of forces on streets and drones in air. Some sensitive areas in the city looked like fortresses, and many roads and lanes in localities remained deserted.City magistrate Alankar Agnihotri said, “Internet will remain suspended for 48 hours, considering the sensitivity of the situation.” The precaution follows last week’s clashes during a procession after Friday prayers over ‘I Love Muhammad’ row. Police resorted to lathi charge to control the situation. So far, over 80 people, including local cleric and Ittehad-e-Millat Council president Tauqeer Raza Khan, his close associates Dr Nafees Khan and Nadeem Khan, have been arrested.On Thursday, Ala Hazrat Association urged the people to offer Friday namaz peacefully and return home promptly.From the Sunni Markaz at Dargah Ala Hazrat, Jamaat Raza-e-Mustafa national vice-president Salman Hasan Khan appealed to imams and the public to maintain peace, avoid rumours and cooperate with authorities. He also requested special prayers during Friday sermons for harmony.In Muslim-majority areas fears of impending action by the administration prevailed. Teams from Bareilly Development Authority are surveying properties to identify violations. Structures without approved maps or violating building regulations will face notices, sealing and demolition.The authority’s vice-chairman Manikandan A said, “Action is being taken at every level against those accused of rioting and their supporters. Every illegal brick will be accounted for. This drive will serve as a lesson to accused and a warning to others who break the law”.In Saharanpur, Chandrashekhar Azad was put under house arrest as he was planning to meet families of those affected in last week’s violence. Azad accused govt of “using police to silence victims and opposition voices” and demanded an impartial probe into the violence.“Following a letter from Bareilly district magistrate, police force from Fatehpur and Dehat police stations were deployed outside Azad’s house in Chhutmalpur area of Saharanpur.

'Pakistan Could Not Kill Him But...': Father On Kargil War Veteran Killed In Ladakh Clashes

Poll Do you think Ladakh should have more local governance powers? Yes, more autonomy is needed No, current administration is sufficient

LEH: At Martyrs’ Park, about 1km from the Ladakh Hill Development Council (LAHDC-Leh) office, the gate stood open during curfew relaxation. Inside, chairs were stacked and a tent was dismantled. Labourers were quietly loading chairs, tent covers and iron rods into a vehicle, their faces grim.It was here that environmental activist Sonam Wangchuk began a 35-day hunger strike Sept 10, demanding Sixth Schedule protections and statehood for Ladakh. “We provide tents on rent. They called us to take it back,” a worker said. Startled at the sight of a reporter, he said, “Please go away, cops will come and we will be in trouble.”A woman entered with her child. “I was on hunger strike on Sept 24 when the situation worsened outside,” she said. “Out of fear, some of us ran in different directions. My husband later picked me up. I came back to collect my belongings.”On Sept 24, security forces opened fire on protesters demanding Sixth Schedule status, killing four and injuring dozens. Wangchuk called off his hunger strike hours later. Authorities said the police fired in self-defence after protesters tried to set ablaze a vehicle carrying security personnel.Police also claimed that without CRPF deployment, “the whole of Leh would have burnt”.Outside the park, another woman voiced her anger. “Why were people fired upon? Four people are dead. Will they give us Sixth Schedule?”About 1km away BJP’s Ladakh office, which was set on fire, was under heavy guard with spools of concertina wire around it. Cops prohibit photography of the building.At the LAHDC-Leh office, the main gate was open but there was no one there. “Since Sept 24, chief executive officer Tashi Gyalson and others haven’t come to office. In fact, no one comes,” a peon said.Mustafa Ladakhi, 36, a PhD from JNU, is among a growing number of Ladakhis at the country’s top universities concerned about home. At a hotel near Leh airport, he said the region is still in shock.“On Sept 24, my mother was on a hunger strike led by Wangchuk. There was chaos when she called me. I found her in the middle of the road. I will never forget the pain that day brought to Ladakhis,” he said. “No official has stepped down. There is no empathy. There is no apology. Instead, we are accused in the national media of destabilising the central govt... How can we be a threat when we have paid with our lives for the nation?”He argued that UT status without statehood had buried local governance under bureaucracy. “Instead of empowering local govt, we have the lieutenant governor’s office and its bureaucracy, commissioner secretaries, the DC’s office, and the police bureaucracy. They have nothing to do in Ladakh. All we see is pomp and a show of bureaucracy... Allow us to govern ourselves,” he said.“When we were part of J&K, AFSPA was never extended to Ladakh because govt knew we were Indian nationalists. Why this labelling now?” he asked.Ladakhi’s friend, a hotel owner, said, “I don’t want to talk about tourism. This is a colossal tragedy. Four deaths in a place like Ladakh are like 400 in Delhi. Sept 24 will remain etched in our memory.”In Upper Tukchal area of Leh, Rigzin Wangmo Lachic, president of All Ladakh Hotel and Guest House Association, echoed similar sentiments and demanded a judicial inquiry. “The events have shattered us and left a wound on our collective soul,” she said.At a hotel serving Kashmiri wazwan on Oct 1, during curfew relaxation, the receptionist from Doda said he no longer felt safe. “I’ve been here 10 years and never faced hostility. But after the lieutenant governor described workers from Doda and Nepal as ‘external forces’ responsible for the crisis, we are not stepping out much.”As curfew returned, shops shut ahead of the 6 pm deadline. “We comply with every direction. But govt must fulfil our four demands, including Sixth Schedule and statehood,” Gelek Punchok, 42, a member of Leh Apex Body, said. Punchok was outside the district jail, with many others, to receive around 26 prisoners released Thursday after they were given bail. Many of the released detainees said they had nothing to do with the Sept 24 violence but stated that they were with the “peaceful” struggle for Sixth Schedule status and statehood.","Environmental activist Sonam Wangchuk began a 35-day hunger strike Sept 10, demanding Sixth Schedule protections and statehood for Ladakh.

NEW DELHI: With drones in the air and armed police forces on the streets, security has been heightened in four districts of Uttar Pradesh 's Bareilly division on the occasion of Dussehra.

Controversy deepens: Police under fire as attorney claims former LSU wide receiver Kyren Lacy wrongly blamed in deadly accident,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/controversy-deepens-police-under-fire-as-attorney-claims-former-lsu-wide-receiver-kyren-lacy-wrongly-blamed-in-deadly-accident/articleshow/124300432.cms,"Former LSU player Kyren Lacy's suicide, ahead of negligent homicide charges, sparks controversy. His attorney, Matt Ory, challenges the Louisiana State Police investigation into a fatal accident. New surveillance footage reportedly shows Lacy was back in his lane before impact, contradicting official accounts. Ory cites inconsistencies and missing witness testimony, suggesting evidence doesn't support Lacy's culpability, deepening the tragedy.

Surveillance footage raises doubts about official version of events

Conflicting reports, missing testimony, and concerns about investigation bias

A tragedy clouded by unanswered questions

The tragic death of former LSU wide receiver Kyren Lacy has taken a complicated legal turn as his attorney, Matt Ory, publicly questioned the Louisiana State Police’s (LSP) handling of the investigation into a fatal accident. The crash, which resulted in the death of 78-year-old Herman Hall, had initially been attributed to Lacy, with prosecutors preparing to pursue negligent homicide charges. Days before facing a grand jury, however, Lacy died by suicide, leaving behind unresolved questions that Ory is determined to raise.According to Ory, newly reviewed evidence undermines the conclusion that Lacy’s driving directly caused the deadly collision. The state’s account stated that Lacy recklessly passed four vehicles in a no-pass zone, setting the stage for the crash. However, surveillance video showed a different picture.“He was 72.6 yards away; he had returned to his lane before the crash occurred,” Ory explained, emphasizing that Lacy had re-entered his lane roughly 90 yards before the impact. He also pointed out that state traffic law requires drivers to be back in their lane within 100 feet, a condition Lacy had already met.The attorney further criticized inconsistencies in the official reports. A driver involved in the crash reportedly swerved to avoid a gold truck rather than Lacy’s green Dodge Charger, raising doubts about which vehicle actually triggered the sequence of events. Ory also cited body-cam footage showing what he described as “coaching” by a trooper, potentially shaping a witness’s account to implicate Lacy.Adding to the controversy is the absence of testimony from a passenger who was inside Lacy’s car. Ory questioned why investigators never identified or interviewed this key witness, whose perspective might have provided crucial clarity.For Lacy’s family, friends, and former teammates, the tragedy goes beyond legal disputes. His untimely death leaves lingering grief and a sense of unfinished justice. Ory insists the evidence points away from Lacy’s responsibility, stating, “The evidence does not support that Kyren Lacy should have known his actions were the cause of the crash.”Also Read: Tyreek Hill sends emotional hospital plea to brands days after devastating season-ending injury As debate intensifies over the accuracy and fairness of the LSP’s findings, the case underscores how unanswered questions can deepen the pain in already heartbreaking circumstances.","Former LSU wide receiver Kyren Lacy died by suicide days before facing negligent homicide charges.

Gisele Bündchen remembers her meeting with Jane Goodall and the inspiration she carried forward

A life that reshaped science and inspired generations

Supermodel Gisele Bündchen, known worldwide for her modeling career and as the former wife of NFL legend Tom Brady, has added her voice to the global chorus of tributes following the death of Dr. Jane Goodall. The renowned primatologist passed away on October 1, 2025, at the age of 91, leaving behind an extraordinary legacy in science, conservation, and humanitarian work.On Instagram, Gisele Bündchen shared an emotional message alongside photos of her time with Goodall, including a selfie and candid moments with the pioneering scientist and her beloved chimpanzees.“What a privilege it was to have met such an extraordinary woman. Jane Goodall's passion for animals, our planet, and living with such heart was truly inspiring. She touched countless lives with her wisdom and kindness and will be deeply missed. Her light and legacy will shine on forever. Thank you, Jane, for changing the world and for being such a bright light,” Bündchen wrote.For Bündchen, who has long been outspoken about sustainability and environmental advocacy, Goodall represented a beacon of hope and proof that one individual could change the world.Her tribute underscores how Goodall’s influence extended far beyond the scientific community, inspiring leaders, celebrities, and everyday people alike.Dr. Goodall first gained international recognition in the 1960s for her groundbreaking chimpanzee research at Gombe Stream National Park in Tanzania. Her findings—showing that chimpanzees use tools, experience complex emotions, and live in intricate social groups—challenged previous scientific beliefs and revolutionized our understanding of evolution.But her influence didn’t stop at research. She went on to establish the Jane Goodall Institute in 1977 and later launched the Roots & Shoots program, which empowered young people worldwide to engage in conservation and community activism.World leaders including Prince William, former U.S. President Barack Obama, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have all shared tributes, praising her as a “trailblazer,” “extraordinary voice,” and a source of wisdom and compassion.Also Read: Gisele Bündchen’s Miami boat ride with Joaquim Valente and baby River stirs buzz as Tom Brady’s yacht looms nearby Goodall’s passing leaves a profound void, but her work will continue through the institutions she built and the generations she inspired—including figures like Bündchen, who now carry her message forward.","Gisele Bündchen remembers her meeting with Jane Goodall and the inspiration she carried forward.

US government shuts down: Elon Musk on the biggest issue that 'stopped' funding of American government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-government-shuts-down-elon-musk-on-the-biggest-issue-that-stopped-funding-of-american-government/articleshow/124250140.cms,"Elon Musk on the US government shutdown

Poll Do you believe the government shutdown will last longer than two weeks? Yes No

Previous US government shutdowns

What programs and payments will stop during US government shutdown





The US government has officially shut down for the first time in six years after a deadlocked Congress failed to pass a funding measure. The full shutdown began at midnight Wednesday, September 30, after Democratic and Republican leaders failed to agree on even a short-term deal to keep the government fully funded past the current fiscal year. So far, it is unclear how long the shutdown will last, or how widespread its impact will be.A key sticking point behind the stalemate is said to be Democrats’ insistence on including the extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits in any stopgap funding bill. Republicans have claimed that Democrats are pushing to provide government benefits to undocumented immigrants. Republicans claim that Democrats want to give health care to ""illegal immigrants."" Democrats say that they are only trying to restore health care coverage options that were available to immigrants having “lawful presence” in the United States before those options were eliminated by President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful” tax bill this year.While so far Elon Musk has not directly commented on the US government shutdown, he has shared/reposted several tweets that support Republican's claim that Democrats want to give health care benefits to ""illegal immigrants”. He quoted VP JD Vance's post on Chuck Schumer rewarding illegal immigrants, and wrote, ""Once Chuck realized that importing voters was a surefire way for Dems to win elections and create a permanent one-party state in America (just like happened in California and New York), he became very much in favor of bribing illegals to come to America!""In his post, JD Vance wrote, ""Chuck Schumer once recognized that it was disastrous to give illegal aliens rewards for breaking the law.Now he wants to shut down the government unless we…reward illegal aliens for breaking the law. x.com/westernlensman…""Elon Musk also shared a Twitter post of White House deputy chief of Staff for Policy and Homeland Security Advisor Stephen Miller that says, ""First shutdown in world history to demand free healthcare for illegal aliens.""""In 2019, every Democrat presidential candidate rose their hand in support for healthcare for illegal aliens. Today, Democrats are willing to shut down the government over free healthcare for illegals. Democrats have always put illegals before Americans,"" reads another Tweet reposted by Elon Musk.The American federal government has either shut down or experienced funding gaps 14 times since 1980. The longest shutdown on record occurred in late 2018 and early 2019, lasting 35 days. That partial shutdown was a result of a stalemate over President Donald Trump’s demand for funding for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.While every government shutdown is unique, they all operate under the same basic principles: non-essential services cease, and many federal employees are furloughed without pay. However, agencies deemed critical for the ""protection of lives and property"" remain operational. These ""essential"" employees, who include air traffic controllers, law enforcement agents, and active-duty military personnel, are required to work but do not receive their paychecks until funding is restored.However, OMB this time is said to be not posting agencies’ shutdown contingency plans on its website. Instead, the plans are hosted only on each agency’s site. This is reported to have made it harder to assess how the Trump administration will handle the shutdown and which activities it will deem essential.","The US government has officially shut down for the first time in six years after a deadlocked Congress failed to pass a funding measure.

"$2,500 for 'self-deportation': Trump admin offers payout for unaccompanied migrant kids to leave US; critics call it 'cruel'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/2500-for-self-deportation-trump-admin-offers-payout-for-unaccompanied-migrant-kids-to-leave-us-critics-call-it-cruel/articleshow/124301646.cms,"Who are eligible for the payout?

Critics slams the move as 'cruel'





President Donald Trump-led US administration is offering unaccompanied migrant children in America a stipend $2,500 if they agree to voluntarily return to their home countries, Reuters reported, citing a letter sent to migrant shelters.According to the letter, issued Friday by the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Office of Refugee Resettlement, children aged 14 and above would qualify for a ""one-time resettlement support stipend of $2,500"" if they choose to leave the United States.According to Reuters, officials confirmed the monetary offer but did not specify the exact amount publicly. The initiative is part of a broader strategy by the Trump administration to encourage voluntary deportations.Earlier this year, DHS had offered $1,000 stipends for adult migrants who opted for ""self-deportation,"" backed by a $250 million fund transfer from the State Department.According to Reuters, an ICE official said the $2,500 offer is initially being made to 17-year-olds. Children from Mexico are not eligible, but those who had already volunteered to leave the US by Friday will also be covered.Payments will only be made after an immigration judge approves the request and the child has safely returned to their home country, the letter added.Under federal law, migrant children arriving at US borders without a parent or legal guardian are classified as unaccompanied and placed in government-run shelters until they can be reunited with family or placed in foster care.As of Thursday, more than 2,100 unaccompanied children were in the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services.Immigration advocates strongly condemned the move, calling it coercive. Wendy Young, president of Kids in Need of Defense, said the stipend was a ""cruel tactic"" that undermines legal protections for vulnerable children.""Unaccompanied children seeking safety in the United States deserve our protection rather than being coerced into agreeing to return back to the very conditions that placed their lives and safety at risk,"" Young said in a statement.HHS officials, however, defended the program, saying it offers children a choice about their future. HHS Communications Director Andrew Nixon stated, the program ""gives UACs a choice and allows them to make an informed decision about their future.""Trump’s efforts to accelerate deportations of migrant children have repeatedly faced legal challenges. Since 2019, more than 600,000 unaccompanied minors have crossed the US -Mexico border, according to government data.","US administration offers $2,500 to unaccompanied migrant children who agree to voluntarily return to their home countries.

Hamas has not accepted the requirement that it have no role in Gaza’s future governance, indicating it may seek to retain influence through a national framework. Negotiation before implementation: The group wants to negotiate the details of the hostage exchange and other elements of the plan before committing to the timeline outlined by Washington.





Hamas on Saturday partially agreed to Donald Trump's 20-point Gaza peace plan and came to a consensus to release all remaining Israeli hostages. Hamas however made it clear that several provisions in the US-brokered 20-point peace plan will need further negotiation. While the group has welcomed parts of the proposal, it has pushed back on crucial clauses related to Gaza’s future governance and its own role in the territory.In a statement, Hamas said it agreed “to release all Israeli prisoners, both living and dead, according to the exchange formula contained in President Trump's proposal” if proper conditions are met.However, it added that several issues “regarding the future of Gaza and the rights of Palestinians” remain under discussion.The announcement came hours after US President Donald Trump gave Hamas a Sunday deadline to accept the peace plan or face “all hell.” After receiving Hamas’s response, Trump posted on Truth Social, “I believe they are ready for a lasting PEACE.” He urged Israel to “immediately stop the bombing of Gaza, so that we can get the Hostages out safely and quickly!” and added that discussions on details were already underway.Also read: Hamas agrees to free Israeli hostages; Trump asks Israel to stop bombing Gaza — Key things to know Tahir al-Nounou, media adviser to the head of Hamas’s political bureau, told the BBC: “President Trump's statements are encouraging, and the movement is ready to begin negotiations immediately to achieve a prisoner exchange, end the war, and secure the withdrawal of the occupation.”Although Hamas has not accepted the overall 20-point plan, it has accepted the proposal partially and signalled a willingness to engage.The US plan calls for an immediate ceasefire and the release within 72 hours of 20 living Israeli hostages and the remains of others believed to be dead, in exchange for hundreds of detained Gazans. Once both sides agree, full humanitarian aid would be sent into Gaza. Around 48 hostages are still held by Hamas, with 20 believed to be alive.Under the proposal, Hamas would have no governing role in Gaza, and it leaves the door open for an eventual Palestinian state. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected this, reiterating his opposition to a Palestinian state. “It's not written in the agreement. We said we would strongly oppose a Palestinian state,” he said.Hamas stated on Friday that parts of the proposal relating to Gaza’s governance and Palestinian rights are still being discussed “within a national framework,” in which Hamas intends to participate.Earlier, Trump warned that failure to accept the deal would lead to severe consequences. “If this LAST CHANCE agreement is not reached, all HELL, like no one has ever seen before, will break out against Hamas. THERE WILL BE PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST ONE WAY OR THE OTHER,” he wrote on Truth Social.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the repercussions of rejecting the plan would be “very grave” for Hamas. “Hamas has an opportunity to accept this plan and move forward in a peaceful and prosperous manner in the region. If they don't, the consequences, unfortunately, are going to be very tragic,” she said.The plan has been welcomed by European and Middle Eastern leaders, and the Palestinian Authority has called Trump’s efforts “sincere and determined.” Trump has also said that if Hamas refuses to agree, Israel will have US backing to “finish the job of destroying the threat of Hamas.” Netanyahu has echoed this stance.Israel’s offensive in Gaza began after the Hamas-led attack on 7 October 2023, which killed around 1,200 people and led to the taking of 251 hostages. Since then, more than 66,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israeli forces continue operations in Gaza City, with Defence Minister Yoav Gallant saying they are “tightening the siege” around the area.James Elder, spokesperson for Unicef, criticised the concept of designated safe zones in Gaza, calling it “farcical”. “Bombs are dropped from the sky with chilling predictability. Schools, which have been designated as temporary shelters, are regularly reduced to rubble,” he said.","Hamas insists on a full and complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, not the staged or partial withdrawal proposed in the plan. Hamas has not accepted the requirement that it have no role in Gaza’s future governance, indicating it may seek to retain influence through a national framework. The group wants to negotiate the details of the hostage exchange and other elements of the plan before committing to the timeline outlined by Washington.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124301837,imgsize-661743,width-400,resizemode-4/palestinians-wave-their-national-flag-and-celebrate-by-a-destroyed-israeli-tank-at-the-southern-gaza-strip-fence-east-of-khan-younis-ap-photo-donald-trump-ap-photo.jpg"

A Chicago alderperson was shoved and handcuffed by the federal immigration agents while she was questioning them at a Humboldt Park Medical Centre on Friday.While sharing details, Alderman Jessie Fuentes said that she was at Humboldt Park Health following a report of immigration agents at the facility. When she questioned the agents about having a warrant to arrest at the medical centre, they did not respond and shoved her, NBC news reported.Fuentes was later handcuffed and threatened with arrest. ""This is violence,"" Fuentes said.Video of the incident shows agents claiming Fuentes was impeding their work. The hospital director mentioned that United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents can enter the emergency room but are prohibited from accessing the operating room.The hospital does not plan to release the individual ICE initially sought to detain, who sustained a broken leg.Fuentes indicated he fractured his leg while fleeing the agents, and attorneys have been appointed to represent him.She also noted that ICE agents have brought several injured individuals to local hospitals during arrests. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson condemned ICE's actions, saying, ""ICE's abusive tactics have no place in our city, and our elected officials will continue to stand with residents against this attempt to stoke fear and intimidation.Chicago's elected officials have a First Amendment right to document ICE's actions and to inform their constituents of their rights without federal interference.

Drone scare: Munich airport operations suspended for second day; dozens of flights disrupted,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/drone-scare-munich-airport-operations-suspended-for-second-day-dozens-of-flights-disrupted/articleshow/124301694.cms,"AP file photo





Germany’s Munich airport halted operations for the second time in 24 hours due to reported drone activity. In a statement issued Friday evening, the airport announced that flights were suspended at 9.30 pm (local time), affecting approximately 6,500 passengers.“On the evening of October 3, German air traffic control (DFS) restricted flight operations at Munich Airport as a precautionary measure due to unconfirmed drone sightings and suspended them until further notice,” the airport said in a statement.The airport had earlier suspended 17 flights shortly after 10.00 pm (local time) on Thursday, affecting nearly 3,000 passengers. Additionally, 15 incoming flights were diverted to Stuttgart, Nuremberg, Frankfurt, and Vienna, Austria, the airport said in a statement.The airport reopened at 5.00 am (local time) on Friday after flight arrivals and departures were deemed safe.“Now everything has resumed. Some flights were cancelled but the airport has reopened. Since 5 am, all arrivals and departures are safe,” a call handler assisting passengers was quoted as saying by CNN.The first flight scheduled to land in Munich was a Lufthansa long-haul service from Bangkok, expected at 5.25 am (local time), according to the airport’s website.The Bavarian airport, a key hub for Lufthansa, handled nearly 20 million passengers in the first half of this year.Munich has become the latest European airport affected by drone sightings, following incidents in Denmark and Norway that disrupted travel for tens of thousands of passengers.Europe has remained on high alert in recent weeks amid repeated drone sightings and alleged Russian incursions into Nato airspace in Poland and Romania, as well as reported violations of Estonian airspace by Russian fighter jets.On Wednesday, European Union leaders backed new measures to bolster the bloc’s defenses against Russian drones.Russian president Vladimir Putin on Thursday joked that he would no longer fly drones over Denmark, though Moscow has denied any involvement in the recent incidents.","Munich airport suspended operations for the second time in 24 hours due to reported drone activity.

Sean Combs case: Who is Arun Subramanian? Indian-origin judge sentenced ‘Diddy’ to 50 months in prison,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/sean-combs-case-who-is-arun-subramanian-indian-origin-judge-sentenced-diddy-to-50-months-in-prison/articleshow/124301597.cms,".

Who is Arun Subramanian?







Sean “Diddy” Combs was sentenced to 50 months in prison and five years of supervised release by Indian-origin District Judge Arun Subramanian for his conviction on two prostitution-related offences. Subramanian also imposed a $500,000 fine, the maximum allowed under the law.Before announcing Combs’ sentence, Subramanian highlighted the repeated nature of his offenses and his history of violence toward former partners. He noted that even after Cassie Ventura filed a lawsuit and Combs issued an apology, the rapper continued to act violently toward Jane.“The court is not assured that if released these crimes would not be committed again,” Subramanian said.Subramanian said the sentence aims to send a message to survivors of domestic abuse that “violence against women is met with real accountability.”The judge also thanked Cassie Ventura and “Jane” for their testimony. “You stood up to power,” he said. “The number of people who you reached is incalculable.”Arun Subramanian was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Indian immigrant parents. His parents, Tamil Brahmin engineers who moved to the US in the 1970s, emphasized education and public service.Subramanian earned a bachelor’s degree in computer science from Case Western Reserve University and a law degree from Columbia in 2004.Appointed by former President Joe Biden in 2023, Subramanian serves as a judge of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, becoming the first South Asian on the bench. He has gained a reputation as both a disciplinarian and a modernizer, qualities highlighted during one of the year’s most high-profile celebrity trials.At 45, Subramanian is one of the youngest judges on the federal bench. During the Diddy trial, his conduct reflected a measured maturity, with reporters describing his approach as “adaptable yet firm.”Subramanian’s early career followed a traditional elite path, including clerkships with Gerard Lynch of the Southern District of New York, Dennis Jacobs of the Second Circuit, and Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.He then joined the litigation firm Susman Godfrey, where he became a partner. His work spanned antitrust cases to civil rights class actions, representing both major corporations and individual plaintiffs.In the Diddy trial, which involved complex issues of race, sex, celebrity, and violence, Subramanian faced the dual challenge of maintaining jury impartiality amid intense public attention and managing the theatrics of high-profile lawyers while upholding court decorum. Observers noted that he succeeded, not through strict authoritarian control, but by consistently guiding proceedings back to order when tensions escalated.","Indian-origin District Judge Arun Subramanian sentenced Diddy to 50 months in prison and five years of supervised release.

From Pathumma To Professor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/from-pathumma-to-professor/articleshow/124301605.cms,"Once confined to stereotypes,

Kerala

’s

Muslim women

are carving new futures—with pen, stethoscope and passport

(The writer is asst professor, dept of English, Calicut University)





By: Umer O ThasneemShe was a staple of Malayalam films—the semi-literate Muslim woman who spoke rustic Malayalam laced with Arabic and looked at the world with innocent bewilderment.She was either the submissive wife of a patriarch or the hapless grass widow, scuttling from pillar to post for someone to read a letter from Arabia. The song ‘Qatharil ninnum kathonnu vannu / Kath kitti Pathumma tharichangu ninnu’ captured her confusion perfectly.Her gullibility invited laughter. Vaikom Muhammad Bashir’s Kunchupathuma in ‘Me Grandad ’ad an Elephant’ exemplified this character—afraid to venture outdoors in daylight, convinced that wandering jins would ensnare her with devilry.Though Kunchupathuma did not hail from Malappuram, she became the stereotype whose symbolic sweep extended beyond its geography. But is this ‘thatha’ now fading into memory? It appears so. Just as the domineering ‘Hajiyaars’ are vanishing, so too are the ‘thathas’. Thanks to the spread of English-medium schools, large-scale migration and changing family patterns, Kerala’s Muslim community is undergoing a tectonic shift.Girls are increasingly educated and mobile. When the Ukraine war broke out, many Malayali students evacuated from the region were young women from Malappuram. Today, large numbers of Muslim girls study in countries such as Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Egypt, Malaysia, and Bangladesh—something unimaginable just a decade ago, when mobility was restricted and early marriage considered inevitable.In the late 1980s, outrage erupted when a Muslim women’s magazine carried a matrimonial advertisement inviting grooms for girls aged just fifteen. That world is gone. Today, many women seeking partners are in their late twenties, with medical or professional degrees. Some families boast four or five daughters who are doctors.The educational boom among girls is visible in research too. Farook College, long dubbed the ‘Aligarh of the South,’ now has research departments dominated by women scholars. Their dissertations range from ‘Muslim Women and Sartorial Resistance’ to ‘Quantum Fiction’ and ‘Polyverses’.This changing demography is striking. Once a boys-only institution, Farook now counts nearly 80% of its students as women and has a woman principal.Many Muslim girls are enrolled in prestigious universities abroad. Neha Jubin topped the UK A-Level exams in 2015, while Reema Shaji secured an engineering scholarship in the US—stories that made headlines.Yet this progress has come at a cost. Boys are struggling to keep pace and this imbalance is feeding into marital discord. Young men raised in patriarchal traditions often find it hard to adjust to educated, assertive women. Advocate T M Khaled in Calicut said this is leading to a rise in divorce cases.But the stigma around divorce is also fading. For many young women, it is no longer ‘die-vorce.’ In Vagamon, Muslim women were in the forefront of even organizing a divorce party, a defiant message to men unwilling to adapt.In joint families, educated brides often ruffle a few feathers. A college lecturer recalls how his parents were shocked by his wife calling him by name and using singular pronouns. For decades, uttering a husband’s name was a no-no. The reformer Vakkom Abdul Khader once named his son after himself in the hope that his wife would be forced to say his name. Legend has it she never did.Today, Muslim women speak openly about their marriages on social media—something only Kamala Das once dared to do. Some post photos seeking partners, listing their conditions.A PhD researcher in English put it bluntly: “I won’t agree to marriage unless I know the salary and qualifications of my partner. A suitor once claimed he had a B.Tech. I checked the university records and found he had failed three papers. I warned him not to deceive other girls.”Not all men resist change. One medical graduate, married to a dentist, said: “I help her in the kitchen. I even change our twins’ diapers. My father or grandfather never did such things—but then, they never married doctors.”More boys are realizing they must adapt. The old model of masculinity—rigid, unquestioned, patriarchal—cannot survive in this new world. A softer masculinity is emerging, one with fresh ‘software and hardware’: Pruning old habits, learning new skills, even if that means training in changing diapers or draining dryers.","Kerala’s Muslim community is undergoing a tectonic shift.

BHOPAL: A 10-year-old girl died under mysterious circumstances near a tableau (Jhanki) pandal in Rajharsh Colony, Kolar, on Thursday afternoon.Police said that the deceased, Riya Rajak, daughter of Sunil Rajak who works as a water supply worker, was a Class 4 student. Around 12:30 pm on Thursday, she was playing with other children near the pandal when she suddenly collapsed. Onlookers noticed a deep wound between her left shoulder & neck, from which blood was profusely bleeding. She was rushed to a private hospital, after which she succumbed to her injuries.Family members said they were busy preparing for a bhandara at the pandal when Riya collapsed.She was immediately rushed to the hospital and doctors even administered half a unit of blood. However, she could not be saved.The grieving family has not expressed suspicion against anyone, stating that they are simple working-class people with no enmity.Police suspect that someone may have been test-firing a weapon during the Dussehra festivities when the stray bullet struck the child. Investigations are underway to identify the weapon holder. Police are also tracing residents in the area who possess licensed firearms.Police have registered a case and launched an intensive search to trace the person responsible for the firing. Notably, this is the second such incident reported this year.Earlier on January 13 in the evening, a stray bullet fired by an unidentified person in the neighbourhood allegedly injured a teenage girl in Berasia locality. The bullet hit her chest while she was on her house terrace collecting clothes.","Riya Rajak was playing with other children near a pandal when she collapsed.

America's 250th birthday: Is US getting a $1 Trump coin? Here's what Treasury said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/americas-250th-birthday-is-us-getting-a-1-trump-coin-heres-what-treasury-said/articleshow/124300716.cms,"



The US Treasury is considering a $1 coin featuring President Donald Trump to mark the country’s 250th anniversary, a Treasury spokesperson said on Friday.In a post on X, Treasurer Brandon Beach shared a coin draft and said that the first drafts, photos shared by a user on X, honor America’s 250th Birthday.""No fake news here. These first drafts honoring America’s 250th Birthday and @POTUS are real. Looking forward to sharing more soon, once the obstructionist shutdown of the United States government is over,"" Beach said.The draft design of the coin, which was overseen by the Office of the US Treasurer Brandon Beach, features Trump’s profile on one side of the coin. The opposite side depicts Trump with a clenched fist in front of an American flag alongside the words “FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT.”“Despite the radical left’s forced shutdown of our government, the facts are clear: Under the historic leadership of President Donald J. Trump, our nation is entering its 250th anniversary stronger, more prosperous, and better than ever before,” a Treasury Department spokesperson said in a statement.“While a final $1 dollar coin design has not yet been selected to commemorate the United States’ semiquincentennial, this first draft reflects well the enduring spirit of our country and democracy, even in the face of immense obstacles.”In 2020, Congress passed bipartisan legislation, signed by Trump during his first term, that authorises the Treasury Secretary to issue one-dollar coins during the 2026 calendar year.The design of those coins must be “emblematic of the United States semiquincentennial.” Beach, who supervises the US Mint, said in a post on X Friday that the administration would share “more soon, once the obstructionist shutdown of the United States govt is over.”Living people are rarely featured on US money. Congress has imposed various restrictions on the ability of Treasury to feature living people and living presidents on currency. It’s not clear whether the latest Trump coin envisioned by the Treasury Department would run afoul of those laws.","The US Treasury is considering a $1 coin featuring President Donald Trump to mark the country's 250th anniversary.

Israel’s foreign minister Gideon Saar condemned the deadly terrorist attack that targeted a Manchester synagogue on Thursday, criticising UK authorities for what he described as their “failure to address this toxic wave of antisemitism.”“I am appalled by the murderous attack near Heaton Park Synagogue on the morning of Yom Kippur, the holiest day for the Jewish people. My deepest condolences go to the families who have lost loved ones, and I wish a swift recovery to the injured,” Saar said on X.He called for the “truth” to be told, adding: “Blatant and rampant antisemitic and anti-Israeli incitement, as well as support for terror, have recently become widespread in London, other UK cities, and on campuses.”Saar further said Israel expects “more than words” from the Keir Starmer-led government, demanding “effective action and enforcement against antisemitic and anti-Israeli sentiment in Britain.”The attack, carried out with a car and a knife, left two people dead and four injured. Police neutralised the suspect and arrested two others.The incident comes ahead of the second anniversary of Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attacks in Israel, after which Israel - a Jewish state - launched a military offensive in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip. Tensions between Israel and the UK have also grown following Britain’s recent recognition of a Palestinian state, along with several other Western nations.","Gideon Saar criticises UK authorities for what he described as their “failure to address this toxic wave of antisemitism’ The attack, carried out with a car and a knife, left two people dead and four injured.

US government shutdown: Education dept employees' out-of-office emails altered to blame Democrats; claim 'none of us contested',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-government-shutdown-education-dept-employees-out-of-office-emails-altered-to-blame-democrats-claim-none-of-us-contested/articleshow/124280514.cms,"



While the US government has already been shut down, some of the employees of the education department discovered their email accounts had been manipulated during their furlough this week.Five employees of the education department discovered that while they were out of the office, they had included partisan talking points that blamed the government shutdown on Democrats.The employees, who spoke with NBC News and provided copies of their out-of-office messages, reported that the wording had been altered from their original compositions. All are civil servants, not political appointees, and requested anonymity out of fear of professional repercussions.Initially, Education officials sent employees templates of nonpartisan out-of-office messages to use in their emails. Several employees stated they used this language earlier in the week, only to find that while they were furloughed, someone had changed it.“We’re looking to hear from federal government workers. If you’re willing to talk with us, please email us at tips@nbcuni.com or contact us through one of these methods,” one employee said.And now the altered email messages included statements such as: “Thank you for contacting me. On September 10-2025, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 5371, a clean continuing resolution. Unfortunately, Democrat Senators are blocking passage of H.R. 5371 in the Senate which has led to a lapse in appropriations. Due to the lapse of appropriations, I am currently in furlough status. I will respond to emails once government functions resume.”One individual reported changing the out-of-office message back to the nonpartisan version, only to have it revert to the partisan wording later.“None of us consented to this. And it’s written in the first person, as if I’m the one conveying this message, and I’m not. I don’t agree with it. I don’t think it’s ethical or legal. I think it violates the Hatch Act,” the employee stated, referring to the law that limits federal employees’ political activity.Another employee explained, “I took the statement that they sent us earlier in the week to use. And I pasted it on top of that — basically has a standard out-of-office. They went in and manipulated my out-of-office reply. I guess they’re now making us all guilty of violating the Hatch Act.”On Wednesday, NBC News reported that some employees at federal agencies were being offered partisan language blaming Democrats for the shutdown to use as their out-of-office messages. Additionally, several federal websites now display language targeting Democrats or the “radical left.” The Education Department’s actions have been criticised for involving individual civil servants in political messaging regardless of their personal views.Madi Biedermann, the deputy assistant secretary for communications, responded: “The email reminds those who reach out to Department of Education employees that we cannot respond because Senate Democrats are refusing to vote for a clean CR and fund the government. Where’s the lie?”One employee expressed frustration over the lack of accountability, stating, “Nobody follows the law anymore, so why does it matter? It seems like laws are dotted lines now, not solid lines. It seems there’s no one to hold this administration accountable to laws.” Regarding potential repercussions, the employee added, “Clearly, this wasn’t done by me; it was done while I was in a furlough status. I think I’d be able to argue that point. ”","Five employees of the education department discovered that while they were out of the office, they had included partisan talking points that blamed the government shutdown on Democrats.

Nepal Burns: Gen Z Protest Turns Deadly, 9 Killed as Police Open Fire in Kathmandu, Curfew Impsosed

Why is Moroccan youth protesting?





Moroccan protests driven by teenagers and internet-savvy youth has turned deadly as authorities on Thursday raised the death toll to 3 as violent youth-led demonstrations over corruption and public spending continue to rock the country.Morocco’s Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch praised the response of security forces and said the government was ready for talks, as organisers called for a sixth night of protests. “The death toll in the protests has risen to three,” Akhannouch said in a statement. ""We have unfortunately recorded the deaths of three people"" during the protests, Akhannouch said, describing the events as ""regrettable"", AFP reported.Local authorities reported that security forces had to resort to firearms after teargas failed to stop demonstrators from storming a police facility in Leqliaa, a small town outside Agadir. The group, armed with knives, set fire to part of the facility and to a vehicle.According to Morocco’s Interior Ministry, the three were shot and killed during an attempt to seize police weapons, although no witnesses could corroborate the report.The ministry added that 354 people, mostly law enforcement personnel, were injured, while hundreds of cars, banks, shops, and public buildings were damaged across 23 provinces.The protests dominated by Gen Z participants have taken Morocco by surprise. Demonstrators have voiced frustration over widespread corruption, contrasting the billions invested in preparations for the 2030 World Cup with underfunded schools and hospitals. Chants have included slogans such as, “Stadiums are here, but where are the hospitals?”The unrest has been further fueled by the recent deaths of eight women in a public hospital in Agadir, which has become a rallying cry against the decline of Morocco’s healthcare system.While the country prepares to host soccer's Africa Cup of Nations later this year and gears up for parliamentary elections in 2026, the protests highlight enduring regional disparities and dissatisfaction with public services, particularly among youth.Officials, however, denied that World Cup-related spending has taken precedence over public infrastructure, noting that many challenges facing the health sector were inherited from previous governments.","Morocco's Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch praised the response of security forces and said the government was ready for talks.

Roske, 26 at the time of her arrest, pleaded guilty in April to attempted assassination and had faced the possibility of life imprisonment.Prosecutors revealed that Roske had travelled from California carrying a handgun, ammunition, a crowbar, pepper spray, and other items with the intent to commit murder “for terroristic purposes.” At Kavanaugh’s residence, she called the police after seeing US Marshals outside, telling the dispatcher she was suicidal and intended to kill the justice, according to court filings.Authorities said Roske’s actions were driven by frustration over expected Supreme Court rulings that would overturn the national right to abortion and roll back gun regulations.At the sentencing hearing, Roske apologised to Kavanaugh and his family for “the considerable distress” she caused, adding, “I have been portrayed as a monster, and this tragic mistake I made will follow me for the rest of my life.”Prosecutors had sought a prison term of at least 30 years, emphasising that Roske had meticulously planned her attack for months and was determined to find the addresses of four unidentified sitting Supreme Court justices. “The defendant posed a very real threat to our system of government, our constitution,” Assistant US attorney Coreen Mao said. “No public official should live in fear of being killed at any moment for doing their job. ”Roske’s lawyers had requested a sentence not exceeding 96 months, highlighting her cooperation with authorities and her decision to call 911 to surrender. They argued, “Roske should be sentenced for what she did, not for what she thought about.”","Sophie Roske, (birth name Nicholas Roske) appeared before US district judge Deborah Boardman in Greenbelt, Maryland.

US health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr has terminated Jeanne Marrazzo, a senior scientist at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), just three weeks after she filed a whistleblower complaint against the Trump administration, alleging discrepancies in vaccine research.""My termination, unfortunately, shows that the leaders of HHS and the National Institutes of Health do not share my commitment to scientific integrity and public health,"" Marrazzo wrote in a statement following her firing. ""Congress must act to protect scientific research from those who would serve political interests first.""Marrazzo was earlier demoted from her position as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in March. Marrazzo had been in her role since August 2023, succeeding D. Anthony Fauci, who had served as NIAID director for nearly four decades.Last month, she filed a complaint claiming her removal was in retaliation for protesting moves by the Trump administration that undermined vaccine research. She also alleged that officials had been flouting court orders and politicizing decisions over grant allocations.In a letter dated September 26, Kennedy informed Marrazzo of her dismissal.“In my capacity as secretary, I have decided to terminate your appointment as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease,” he wrote, without providing any explanation, as reported by New York Times.Marrazzo’s firing was a part of a long list of dismissals under Kennedy, who has indicated plans to cut at least 10,000 positions as part of a restructuring of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). In June, Kennedy removed all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Vaccine Practices, which makes vaccine recommendations to the Centers for Disease Control.Kennedy, long known for spreading doubts about vaccine safety and efficacy, has continued controversial policies since taking office. He has scrapped $500 million in research grants for mRNA vaccines, which are credited with saving millions of lives during the Covid-19 pandemic.Over the past nine months, the Trump administration has slashed budgets, fired thousands of scientists, and significantly reduced federal health research funding. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been cut from programs focused on developing cures and new treatments for cancer.","Jeanne Marrazzo, a senior scientist at the National Institutes of Health, was fired by US health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr. Three weeks earlier, she filed a whistleblower complaint against the Trump administration, alleging discrepancies in vaccine research.

The Trump administration has reversed cuts to counterterrorism funding for New York, US President Donald Trump announced in a post on Friday.“I am pleased to advise that I reversed the cuts made to Homeland Security and Counterterrorism for New York City and State. It was my Honor to do so,” Trump said in a Truth Social.According to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), “While FEMA’s initial allocation fully met program requirements, after consultation with federal partners and in recognition of our critical security partnership with New York, FEMA is providing access to $136 million, bringing the State Homeland Security funding to $187 million to ensure it has the resources needed to counter and combat evolving threats”, reported CNN.New York Governor Kathy Hochul welcomed the reversal and credited Trump for restoring the funds. Writing on X, the Democratic leader said, “ I’m glad that @POTUS heard our call to reverse these cuts. That means $187 million for the NYPD, FDNY & first responders across the state that keep New Yorkers safe.”Hochul had earlier warned DHS Secretary Kristi Noem that slashing 86% of the state’s homeland security funding “serves only to make not just New York but all of America more vulnerable to terrorist attacks.”A federal judge also raised similar concerns on Wednesday, citing the 9/11 attacks and other threats, and blocked the diversion or withdrawal of $34 million in funding meant to protect New York’s transportation system, the Associated Press reported.The funding reversal comes amid broader tensions between the Trump administration and Democratic-led states over federal spending. While the counterterrorism cuts predated the ongoing government shutdown, the administration has threatened New York and other blue states with consequences if the shutdown persists.White House budget chief Russell Vought confirmed on Wednesday that funding for two major New York City construction projects—the Hudson Tunnel Project and the Second Avenue Subway—has been paused due to the shutdown.",US President Donald Trump reversed cuts to counterterrorism funding for New York.

PoJK protests at the core







Protests in Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK) continued for a sixth consecutive day on Friday, spilling into the country’s capital, triggering a shocking police raid on the Islamabad National Press Club (NPC) that left several journalists injured and equipment vandalised.The assault has sparked nationwide outrage, with journalist unions announcing a “Black Day” in protest against what they called an attack on press freedom, ANI reported.Islamabad police stormed the National Press Club on Thursday, where members of the Lawyers’ Community of PoK were holding a peaceful demonstration in solidarity with ongoing protests in the region.Visuals widely shared on social media showed baton-wielding policemen dragging journalists, smashing cameras, and assaulting media staff inside the club premises. In one video, a photojournalist could be seen with a torn shirt and a broken camera.The Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) strongly condemned the attack, calling it one of the “darkest days” in Pakistan’s history.PFUJ President Afzal Butt said black flags would be hoisted at press clubs across the country in solidarity. “This is not only the Islamabad press club's issue,” Butt said at a press conference.“Press clubs across Pakistan believe that if they ignore this worst incident, tomorrow it could be Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar or Quetta,” he added.Videos circulating on social media show Pakistani Rangers using tear gas shells and live ammunition to disperse crowds. Internet, mobile, and landline services have been shut down, cutting off residents from their families and worsening the crisis.Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the incident and ordered an inquiry into the raid. “Violence against the journalist community cannot be tolerated under any circumstances,” Naqvi said, promising disciplinary action against those responsible.However, journalist unions rejected what they termed “mere promises.” They warned that if the government continued to use police action to suppress dissent, the protests would intensify.The Islamabad incident comes amid massive protests in PoK, which have entered their sixth consecutive day.The protests, which began two years ago, were initially sparked by demands for political reforms, subsidised wheat flour, reduced electricity tariffs, free education and healthcare, and an end to privileges for government officials.The unrest intensified after at least three civilians were killed during police firing in Muzaffarabad, ANI reported.Their funeral processions drew thousands, fuelling more anger. Reports suggest that over 10 people have died in the clashes so far, with many critically injured.","Islamabad police stormed the National Press Club on Thursday.

The Commonwealth Observer Group (COG) has officially released its report on Pakistan’s 2024 general elections, noting “conditions that appeared to impact one party’s ability to fairly contest the election” — namely the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), led by incarcerated former Prime Minister Imran Khan The report, which included a ""Letter of Transmittal"" by COG chairperson and former Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, cited the denial to PTI of its election symbol, Khan’s consecutive convictions ahead of polling, and restrictions on freedom of association and assembly.Jonathan wrote: “When looked at in isolation, some – though not all – of the arguments advanced by key institutions in support of their actions appear somewhat justifiable. Yet, collectively, it could not go unnoticed that these decisions consistently limited one party's ability to contest the election on a level playing field.”The observers expressed particular concern over the Supreme Court of Pakistan’s revocation of PTI’s iconic “bat” symbol — linked to Khan’s cricketing past — on grounds that the party failed to hold intra-party elections. With the decision coming just weeks before polling, PTI candidates were forced to run as independents, depriving them of a unifying symbol.The group also flagged Khan’s multiple convictions shortly before polling day, along with restrictions on PTI’s rallies and gatherings. “There were also limitations on fundamental political rights, including freedom of association and assembly. These limitations were felt most acutely by PTI and its supporters,” the report said.The COG called for reforms to strengthen transparency and ensure a level playing field for all parties in future Pakistani elections.The report found that mainstream English-language media “broadly followed the principles of fair and accurate election reporting,” though PTI-affiliated independent candidates received ""less positive"" coverage.By contrast, state-owned PTV News lacked balance, focusing mainly on the ruling PML-N and PPP, and reportedly barred references to Khan by name. The group concluded that these factors may have “impinged on the credibility, transparency and inclusiveness of the electoral process.”The report had been controversial after media reports suggested the Commonwealth had “buried” it following widespread problems in the February 8 polls. Submitted to the Commonwealth secretary-general on November 20, 2024, the publication was delayed without explanation.The PTI had repeatedly demanded its release, arguing it confirmed “systemic rigging, institutional bias, and deliberate targeting” of the party and its founder.","Commonwealth Observer Group releases report on Pakistan's 2024 general elections.

Trump's 20-point peace plan







Pakistan’s top leadership may send troops to Gaza as part of a Muslim nations’ peacekeeping force under a comprehensive peace deal announced by US President Donald Trump.The decision was announced by Pakistan’s foreign minister Ishaq Dar on Tuesday.At a press conference in Islamabad, Dar was asked directly about Pakistan’s role in the initiative, which aims to end the bloodshed in Gaza. “The force [here] is a peacekeeping force. On the ground, there will be Palestinian law-enforcement agencies... there will be [separate] forces supporting them. Indonesia has offered 20,000 troops for that. I am sure Pakistan's leadership will also be making a decision on this,” he said.Dar explained that the idea was to set up an independent Palestinian government of technocrats overseen by an international body. He said Pakistan had asked for the arrangements to be documented at the UN Security Council.He shared that a preparatory meeting of leaders from eight Muslim countries with US President Trump was held in New York last week on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. “The objectives were to try for a ceasefire in Gaza, make arrangements for sending humanitarian aid, stop the forced displacement of Palestinians and make arrangements for the return of the displaced Gazans,” he said.Dar added that the plan also included Gaza’s reconstruction and halting Israel’s efforts to annex the West Bank. According to him, Trump proposed that his team work with the foreign ministers of the Muslim nations to create a “workable solution.”The foreign minister said Saudi Arabia had reached out to Pakistan with a draft joint statement on the plan, which was later revised after his input. He noted that the Palestinian Authority welcomed the statement.On Monday, Donald Trump unveiled a 20-point peace plan aimed at ending the Gaza war by demanding Hamas’s disarmament, the immediate release of all hostages within 72 hours, and a phased withdrawal of Israeli forces. Under the proposal, Hamas would be excluded from any future governance; militants willing to abandon arms would receive amnesty, while those wishing to leave Gaza would be allowed safe passage. The plan also involves a temporary technocratic Palestinian committee ruling Gaza under oversight by an international “Board of Peace” led by Trump and including Tony Blair, until the Palestinian Authority is reformed.The initiative calls for humanitarian aid to flow into Gaza without interference from either Israel or Hamas, managed by UN agencies and the Red Crescent, with reconstruction under a “New Gaza” framework. Trump gave Hamas three to four days to accept the plan or face what he called “a very sad end.”","Pakistan's top leadership may send troops to Gaza as part of a Muslim nations' peacekeeping force.
