NEW DELHI: Congress party on Sunday criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi's participation in a podcast with computer scientist Lex Fridman, pointing out his reluctance to hold press conferences whilst engaging with a US podcaster.Jairam Ramesh, Congress general secretary for communications, contested the prime minister's statement about ""criticism is the soul of democracy"" during the podcast. He accused PM Modi of destroying institutions meant for government accountability and targeting critics aggressively.""He who is afraid of facing the media in a press conference has found comfort in a foreign podcaster anchored in the rightwing ecosystem,"" Ramesh wrote on X.The Congress leader further said: ""And he has the gall to say that ""criticism is the soul of democracy"" when he has systematically gutted every institution that is to hold his Government accountable and gone after critics with a vengeance that no one in recent history has matched! There is no limit to Hypo(d)crisy.""During his conversation with American computer scientist and podcaster Lex Fridman, PM Modi discussed various topics including his early life, Swami Vivekananda's influence, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), and international relations.PM Modi discussed his diplomatic efforts with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy regarding peace negotiations. He also spoke about his relationship with US President Donald Trump, noting similarities between Trump's ""America First"" position and his own ""India First"" stance, emphasising their focus on national priorities.""I have observed President Trump both during his first term and now in his second run. This time, he seems far more prepared than before. He has a clear roadmap in his mind with well-defined steps, each one designed to lead him toward his goals,"" he said. Modi expressed gratitude for receiving his life's purpose and values of selfless service from Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the spiritual foundation of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).","Congress party criticises PM Modi's participation in a podcast with Lex Fridman.

"Trump and I both put nation first, that’s our connect: PM Modi",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trump-and-i-both-put-nation-first-thats-our-connect-pm-modi/articleshow/119094169.cms,"I’m not neutral, I strive for peace: PM on Ukraine





NEW DELHI: Expressing admiration for Donald Trump’s courage and resilience, PM Narendra Modi said his connect with the US president was that they both put nation first and had dedicated themselves to the service of the nation.“Even after being shot (July 2024), he remained unwaveringly dedicated to America. His life was for his nation. Trump’s will to live and fight for the US even after being shot appeals to me because this showed his America First spirit, just as I believe in Nation First. I stand for India First and that’s why I connect so well (with Trump),” the PM said.Modi’s emphatic endorsement of Trump in a podcast with Lex Fridman, popular podcaster and research scientist at MIT, comes at a time US allies, particularly Europe and Canada, are taking a heavy battering from the president who has been accused by some of dragging America into isolationism with his policies.India itself has been under threat from Trump’s tariff war but is hoping for an exemption from the Apr 2 deadline for reciprocal tariffs, based on a trade deal it’s negotiating.Trump was far more prepared in his second term, with a clear roadmap and steps to achieve his goals, the PM said, adding that he had put together a “strong, capable” team to assist him.In the podcast, Modi backed the recent thaw in ties with China said said normalcy had returned to the border since his meeting with President Xi Jinping last year, and that trust, enthusiasm and energy would return in bilateral ties “slowly but surely”. He said efforts were on to restore conditions to how they were before 2020.On Pakistan, while describing it as the epicentre of terrorism, Modi said all Indian attempts for a reconciliation had met with hostility and expressed hope Pakistan will choose the right path as its people deserved a future free of violence.On the Russia-Ukraine war, Modi strongly reiterated India’s position that both countries need to return to the negotiating table.“I can tell President Putin this is not the era of war. I can also tell President Zelensky that regardless of how many people stand with you, there will never be a resolution on the battlefield. Ukraine may hold countless discussions with its allies, but it will bear no fruit. Discussions must include both sides,” he said, adding the current situation provided an opportunity for meaningful talks between Russia and Ukraine. “I am not neutral. I strive for peace,” he said, underlining India’s position and expressing concern about how the war has hurt the Global South.Asked about his relations with Trump, Modi appreciat ed the “trust” that the president has in him. “Even after being shot, he remained unwaveringly dedicated to America. His life was for his nation. Trump’s will to live and fight for the US even after being shot appeals to me because this showed his America First spirit, just as I believe in Nation First. I stand for India First and that’s why I connect so well (with Trump),” the PM said.Asked what he liked about Trump, Modi recalled that the US president, during his first term, had ignored security protocol and agreed to his request to take a lap around the stadium hosting the ‘Howdy Modi’ event in Houston. “I was touched by his courage and his trust in me,” he said.On Trump describing him as a tough negotiator, Modi said he always puts India’s interests first. “That’s why in every forum, I speak up for India’s interest, not to harm anyone but in a positive manner and because of that, no one takes offence,” he said.On China, Modi said differences between the two countries were natural but “our focus is on ensuring these don’t turn into disputes”. “Instead of discord, we emphasise dialogue for building cooperative relationship. After my meeting with President Xi, we are seeing a return of normalcy to the border. We are now working to restore conditions to how they were before 2020. Slowly but surely, trust, enthusiasm and energy will return,” he said.“Of course, it will take some time because of the five-year gap. Our cooperation is essential also for global stability and prosperity. Since the 21st century will be Asia’s century, we want India and China to compete in a healthy way. Competition is not a bad thing but it should never turn into a conflict,” he added.","“Even after being shot (July 2024), he remained unwaveringly dedicated to America. His life was for his nation.

Watch: 31 killed in Yemen after Trump orders airstrike on Houthi rebels,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-us-launches-airstrikes-in-yemen-as-trump-vows-to-stop-houthi-attacks-rebels-react/articleshow/119057577.cms,"US strikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen

Who are the Houthis?

Who backs Houthi rebels?

Major attacks by Houthis

At least 31 people were killed after US President Donald Trump ordered a military strike on Houthi-held areas in Yemen, reported news agency Reuters.Houthis, the militant group in Yemen, has claimed that the US strikes killed civilians, including children in the capital Sanaa on Saturday.The aerial strikes against the Yemeni rebel group came after Trump vowed to use ""overwhelming lethal force"" in the back of the Houthis' operations in the Red Sea.The airstrikes also mark the first US military action against the Houthis since Trump’s administration began in January amid the rebels' attacks on Israel and Red Sea vessels amid the Gaza conflict.Before the strike Trump posted on Truth Social his intention to ""use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective"", citing the Houthis' threats to Red Sea shipping.The Houthis released a statement in response declaring that the strikes ""will not pass without response"".""This aggression will not pass without a response, and our Yemeni armed forces are fully prepared to confront escalation with escalation,"" the rebels' political bureau said in a statement on their Al-Masirah television.Trump had also demanded Iran cease support for the rebels immediately. The rebels, controlling substantial parts of Yemen for over ten years, belong to the pro-Iran ""axis of resistance"" groups opposing Israel and the United States.They have conducted numerous drone and missile strikes against vessels near Yemen in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden during the Gaza conflict, expressing solidarity with Palestinians.These actions disrupted the crucial shipping route, which typically handles 12 percent of global maritime traffic, compelling numerous companies to reroute around southern Africa.The US has conducted multiple strikes on Houthi positions, sometimes with British support. The Houthis suspended attacks during Gaza's January ceasefire but announced on Tuesday they would resume until Israel allows aid into Palestinian territory.Trump's communication avoided mentioning the Israel dispute, concentrating on previous Houthi attacks on commercial vessels. ""To all Houthi terrorists, YOUR TIME IS UP, AND YOUR ATTACKS MUST STOP, STARTING TODAY. IF THEY DON'T, HELL WILL RAIN DOWN UPON YOU LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE!"" he said.""Do NOT threaten the American People, their President... or Worldwide shipping lanes. If you do, BEWARE, because America will hold you fully accountable and, we won't be nice about it!"" he added.The Houthis, officially known as Ansar Allah, are a Zaidi Shia rebel group from northern Yemen, primarily based in Saada province. They emerged in the 1990s as a religious-political movement opposing Saudi-backed Sunni influence and Western interference in Yemen.The group was founded by Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi, who was killed in 2004 by Yemeni government forces, triggering an ongoing conflict. Though Zaidi Shia Islam is distinct from the Twelver Shia Islam of Iran, the Houthis have received military and financial support from Iran, leading to accusations that they serve as an Iranian proxy.The group gained global attention in 2014 when they took control of Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, forcing President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi into exile and sparking a war with the Saudi-led coalition in 2015. Since then, they have engaged in missile and drone attacks against Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and recently, international shipping vessels in the Red Sea.Their attacks, particularly on Israel-linked ships, have drawn US and UK airstrikes in retaliation. The Houthis claim these actions are in support of Palestine, but their increasing aggression in the region has led to fears of wider conflict.Currently, they control much of northern Yemen, running a parallel government while continuing their fight against Yemeni government forces, Saudi Arabia, and UAE-backed militias.The Houthis primarily receive support from Iran, which provides them with weapons, military training, and financial assistance. Iran sees the Houthis as a useful ally in its broader strategy to counter Saudi Arabia and expand its influence in the region. The Lebanese Hezbollah, another Iranian-backed group, has also reportedly provided military training and strategic guidance to the Houthis.In addition to Iran and Hezbollah, the Houthis have received support from various local tribes in Yemen, particularly those opposed to Saudi influence. Some reports suggest that North Korea has also secretly supplied them with weapons, though this is less confirmed.The Houthis claim to be fighting against Western imperialism, and in recent conflicts, they have aligned themselves with the Iran-led ""Axis of Resistance"", which includes groups like Hezbollah, Hamas, and various militias in Iraq and Syria.The Houthis have carried out several major attacks, disrupting global security and trade. In September 2019, they launched drone and missile strikes on Saudi Aramco oil facilities in Abqaiq and Khurais, temporarily halving Saudi oil production. In January 2022, they attacked Abu Dhabi with drones and missiles, killing three people and targeting an oil facility and the international airport.Throughout 2021-2022, they launched ballistic missiles at Saudi cities, including a strike on a Jeddah oil depot during a Formula 1 race. Since late 2023, they have attacked Red Sea shipping, claiming to target Israel-linked vessels, leading to US and UK airstrikes on Houthi positions.In November 2023, they hijacked the Galaxy Leader, an Israeli-linked ship, escalating tensions further. Their increasing use of advanced drones and missiles has turned them into a key regional threat.","Houthis, the militant group in Yemen, has claimed that the US strikes killed civilians, including children in the capital Sanaa on Saturday. The airstrikes also mark the first US military action against the Houthis since Trump’s administration began in January.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119062835,imgsize-4890408,width-400,resizemode-4/119062835.jpg"

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi shared an interesting moment during his conversation with Lex Fridman from his visit to the White House during Barack Obama’s presidency, revealing how his practice of fasting became a topic of discussionAs part of the formal itinerary, a high-level bilateral meeting was followed by a state dinner.However, there was a moment of concern among US officials when they realised that PM Modi was fasting. “How do you host the leader of such a major nation at the White House without serving food?” they wondered.When dinner was served, PM Modi simply placed a glass of hot water in front of him. To lighten the mood, he turned to Obama and quipped, “Look, my dinner has arrived.”The incident left a lasting impression on the former US President. When PM Modi visited the White House again later, this time for a lunch meeting, Obama greeted him with a smile and a playful remark: “Last time you were fasting, this time we’re having lunch. Since you’re not fasting, you’ll have to eat twice as much.”During his conversation with Lex Fridman, PM Modi also explained that fasting had been an integral part of his life for over 50 years. He revealed that he never intended to make it public, but after he became chief minister and later Prime Minister, people started noticing his routine.“Most of the time, I don’t even let people know about it. It’s my personal matter,” he said, adding that he only spoke about it if asked, hoping his experience could help others.He described fasting not just as a religious or cultural practice but as a deeply scientific and spiritual discipline. “Fasting is not just about skipping meals. If someone goes hungry due to hardship, that’s not fasting. True fasting is a process of inner discipline and balance,” he explained.He shared how fasting sharpens the senses and enhances awareness. “You may notice the aroma of water, something you never realised before. A flower you have seen a thousand times appears more vivid. The mind gains clarity, and thoughts flow effortlessly”, he said.PM Modi also spoke about his rigorous fasting schedule, particularly during Chaturmas, when he eats only once a day for over four months, and Navratri, when he fasts for nine days, consuming only hot water or a single fruit.Despite this, he continues his responsibilities without any disruption. “Fasting never slows me down. Sometimes I even work more,” he said, adding that his discipline had only strengthened his ability to lead effectively.",PM Narendra Modi shared an interesting moment from his visit to the White House during Barack Obama’s presidency.

NEW DELHI: In a podcast with Lex Fridman , Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke in detail about India’s troubled relationship with Pakistan while calling out the neighbouring country for state-sponsored terrorism and failed peace efforts .The discussion, which was part of a three-hour-long podcast episode released on Sunday, explored India's historical ties with Pakistan, past attempts at fostering diplomacy and PM Modi’s vision for the future of bilateral relations .Fridman asked the Prime Minister about the tense conflict between the two nuclear-armed nations and whether he saw a path to friendship and peace.PM Modi responded by recalling India’s partition in 1947, describing it as a painful and bloody chapter in history. He explained that despite India's acceptance of partition, Pakistan did not choose peaceful coexistence.""After getting their own way, we expected them to live and let live, and yet, they chose not to foster a harmonious coexistence. Time and again, they decided to be at odds with India. They have waged a proxy war against us,"" PM Modi said in the podcast.He accused Pakistan of exporting terror, saying that India is not its only victim — terrorist activities linked to Pakistan have impacted the entire world.""Wherever terror strikes in the world, the trail somehow leads to Pakistan. Take the September 11 attacks, for example. The mastermind behind it, Osama bin Laden—where did he eventually emerge from? He had taken refuge in Pakistan. The world has recognized that in a way terrorism and the terrorist mindset are deeply rooted in Pakistan,"" he said.PM Modi further called Pakistan an "" epicentre of turmoil "", urging its leadership to ""abandon the path of terrorism"" and work towards peace. He also mentioned that the people of Pakistan themselves long for peace, as they have suffered from years of internal unrest and terrorist violence.When Fridman asked PM Modi about past attempts to improve India-Pakistan relations , PM Modi recalled his historic invitation to Pakistan’s then-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif for his swearing-in ceremony in 2014.""My first attempt at improving bilateral relations was when I invited my Pakistani counterpart to my swearing-in. It was a gesture of goodwill, a diplomatic gesture unlike any in decades,"" he said.He also elaborated on his surprise visit to Lahore in 2015, aimed at fostering better ties between the two countries. However, he lamented that every peace initiative was met with hostility and betrayal from Pakistan.""Yet, every noble attempt at fostering peace was met with hostility and betrayal. We sincerely hope that wisdom prevails upon them and they choose the path of peace,"" PM Modi added.PM Modi’s discussion with Fridman is part of the American podcaster’s globally popular show, which has featured influential figures like Elon Musk, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos.Fridman had earlier described the interview as “one of the most powerful conversations” of his life.","PM Modi spoke in detail about India’s troubled relationship with Pakistan while calling out the neighbouring country for state-sponsored terrorism and failed peace efforts.

Once there, someone in the group raised the topic, leading Ansu to dial her back home and, once the call ended, allegedly speak offensively about her. This led to an altercation that soon snowballed into a free-for-all. Sonu and Sudheer attacked Ansu with a wooden log and iron rod. Shyam and Deepu intervened but Sonu and Sudheer attacked and killed them too, police said. A murder case was filed.",Three labourers from Bihar were killed and another was injured in a brawl late Saturday among a group of tipsy workers partying at a construction site on Bengaluru's outskirts.

What is the Places of Worship Act?

NEW DELHI: Whitewashing of Sambhal Jama Masjid began on Sunday after the orders of the Allahabad high court , which also allowed the mosque to be decorated with lights without any tampering.The high court, in its March 12 order, permitted decorative lighting of the Masjid’s exterior, provided no structural modifications are made. The court scheduled the next hearing in the case for April 8.The mosque, a Mughal-era structure, gained national attention following unrest on November 24, 2024, which left four people dead after a local court ordered a survey of the site.The dispute around the Shahi Jama Masjid arose after a legal petition claimed that the mosque was built over an ancient Hari Har Mandir.The petition led to a court-ordered survey, which sparked significant tension in the area.In November 2024, clashes erupted between protesters and the police, reportedly resulting in multiple deaths as security forces attempted to control the unrest.The dispute also reignited debates around the Places of Worship Act, 1991, which legally upholds the religious status of sites as they existed on August 15, 1947.The Places of Worship Act, 1991, aims to maintain the religious character of places of worship as they were on August 15, 1947.It prohibits the conversion of any religious site from one faith to another and bars courts from entertaining any legal disputes regarding such conversions. The only exception to this law is the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid case, which was already under litigation when the act was passed.The legislation was introduced to prevent communal conflicts over places of worship. However, recent legal challenges, particularly regarding mosques in Varanasi, Mathura, and Sambhal, have brought the act under renewed debate, with some groups arguing that historical grievances should be reconsidered despite the law’s restrictions.","The mosque, a Mughal-era structure, gained national attention following unrest on November 24, 2024, which left four people dead.

Errol Musk on having child with Elon: 'Any woman with a slight brain would be mad to say no',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/errol-musk-on-having-child-with-elon-any-woman-with-slight-brain-would-be-mad-to-say-no-ashley-st-clair/articleshow/118807869.cms,"Errol on St. Clair: ‘A little crazy’ or the opportunity of a lifetime?

No clarifications, just more speculation

Errol’s contradictions: Defending Elon while taking shots at his exes

Tech billionaire Elon Musk 's father Errol Musk , never one to hold back, has weighed in on the swirling controversy surrounding Ashley St. Clair’s claim that she secretly gave birth to Elon’s 13th child. While making it abundantly clear that he has no insider knowledge, Errol still had plenty to say—dropping his usual mix of blunt opinions and offbeat musings.Sitting in his sprawling South African home, surrounded by chaotic domesticity, Errol made no effort to soften his words about the 26-year-old right-wing influencer. “I would find it very strange if a woman is saying she has had a child with Elon and telling people quite publicly about it,” he said during an interview with the Daily Mail. “If it turns out not to be true, she would be a little crazy, don’t you think?”But in the next breath, his tone shifted. “Any woman with a slight brain would be mad to turn down the opportunity if she were to be offered a child with Elon,” he said as quoted by the Daily Mail, an eyebrow-raising remark that seemed both a backhanded compliment and a subtle dig at St. Clair’s credibility.These remarks came as the woman, right-wing influencer Ashley St. Clair, filed a paternity lawsuit against Musk, seeking sole custody of their alleged child, born in September 2024. St. Clair claims that Musk has shown minimal involvement in the child's life, having visited only three times since the birth. Despite the controversy, the head of the US government's Department of Government Efficiency has neither confirmed nor denied St. Clair's claims.Despite his sharp words, Errol refused to take a definitive stance on whether St. Clair was telling the truth. When pressed, he simply let his earlier statements hang in the air, leaving the speculation to simmer.His comments stand in contrast to his past critiques of Elon as a father. Just weeks ago, Errol publicly accused his billionaire son of being a neglectful parent, particularly in the wake of the tragic loss of Elon’s first child, Nevada, in 2002. But in this latest conversation, his tone seemed more conciliatory.Though Errol has often been openly critical of Elon, he appears to have drawn the line at St. Clair’s allegations. In fact, his words hinted at an uncharacteristic moment of defense for his son. “I think Elon is a good father. He is trying to be,” he said. “No one sets out to be a bad father. It’s very difficult.”Yet, true to form, his defenses often come with a sting. When the subject turned to Elon’s other exes—particularly Grimes—Errol was less forgiving. “She is nice, an attractive girl in some ways... She is a little nuts,” he quipped, before attributing the couple’s children’s “very weird” names solely to the musician. “It’s not Elon’s work. He was trying to make her happy.”","Errol Musk has weighed in on the controversy surrounding Ashley St. Clair's claim that she secretly gave birth to Elon’s 13th child. “I would find it very strange if a woman is saying she has had a child with Elon and telling people quite publicly about it,” he said during an interview with the Daily Mail.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118808243,imgsize-1449611,width-400,resizemode-4/118808243.jpg"

Accused denies drunk driving, claims innocence

Legal proceedings and further investigation

NEW DELHI: Rakshit Ravish Chaurasia , the 23-year-old prime accused in the fatal Vadodara car crash that claimed the life of a woman and left eight others injured, was brought back to the accident site for a crime scene recreation. In a video shared by ANI, Chaurasia appeared visibly uncomfortable, limping and clutching his ears as he was escorted by the police.The dramatic scene unfolded as investigators attempted to piece together the events of the early hours of March 14, when a speeding car driven by Chaurasia allegedly rammed into a two-wheeler. The impact proved fatal for one woman, while several others sustained serious injuries.Vadodara Police Commissioner Narasimha Komar disclosed new details, stating that more than three vehicles were linked to the incident, including two active vehicles and one electric vehicle (EV). While Chaurasia is currently in custody, police are scrutinizing all angles, including possible intoxication at the time of the crash.“We have registered a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, apart from invoking sections under the Motor Vehicle Acts. Our forensic teams are compiling physical and material evidence,"" the police said in a statement.Chaurasia, however, has refuted allegations of drunk driving. He claimed that he had attended a Holika Dahan celebration but did not consume alcohol or attend any post-event parties. According to him, he was driving at a speed of 50 km/h at the time of the crash.“I was not drunk. I went to the Holika Dahan event but did not drink or party. I want to meet the victim’s family and take responsibility for the accident,” Chaurasia reportedly told police.Authorities, however, are not taking his statement at face value. “Blood samples have been collected from Chaurasia and his co-passenger Pranshu Chauhan to determine whether alcohol or other intoxicants were involved. The investigation will proceed based on forensic findings,” Commissioner Komar said.Police continue to track the movements of the accused’s co-passenger and are in the process of recovering crucial digital and physical evidence from the scene. The forensic report will play a key role in determining whether Chaurasia was indeed sober at the time of the accident.With mounting evidence and a growing legal case, the Vadodara hit-and-run is quickly turning into a high-profile investigation. The next steps will depend on forensic reports and the police’s final charge sheet.","Rakshit Ravish Chaurasia, 23, is the prime accused in the fatal Vadodara car crash that claimed the life of a woman and left eight others injured.

PATNA: A police constable assigned as a security guard to RJD leader Tej Pratap Yadav was sent to police lines on Sunday after being seen dancing in his official uniform during Holi festivities at the former Bihar minister’s residence.The action came after the video of the incident went viral on social media.The Patna Senior Superintendent of Police’s office issued an official statement on Sunday, confirming that Constable Deepak Kumar was immediately transferred to police lines for his conduct while on duty. “Constable Deepak, posted as a security guard of MLA Tej Pratap Yadav, is sent to police lines for dancing in uniform with immediate effect,” mentioned part of the order. The authorities have arranged for another constable to take over Kumar’s position in the MLA’s security duty.The MLA from the Hasanpur constituency found himself in fresh controversy on Saturday when he instructed the constable to perform a thumka or face suspension. In the viral video, Yadav, the elder son of former chief ministers Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi, is seen taking the name of the policeman from the temporary stage and asking him to dance while he was regally sitting on a sofa.“Ae sipahi, ae Deepak, abhi ek gana bajaenge jis par tumko thumka lagana padega. Nahin lagaoge to tumko suspend kar denge. Bura na maano Holi hai (we are going to play a song on which you shall perform a pelvic thrust. If you do not, you will be suspended. Don't mind. It's Holi),” Yadav was heard saying, followed by a religious tune commonly played during the festival of colours in Bihar, performed by a musical band. The lurid drama unfolded at Yadav’s residence during the Holi celebration on Saturday.The video has also stirred political controversy. Highlighting Yadav's remark, BJP national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla said on X: “This is why they need to be kept out of power! Imagine if this is what they do out of power—what they will do in power (sic).”In response to all the criticism, Yadav also wrote on X: “This festival of mutual brotherhood has also been given a new colour of hatred by BJP and RSS along with their lapdog media.

It was only when she was rescued that she realised ASI Ramcharan Gautam of State Armed Force had been killed.The administration has claimed prohibitory orders under Section 163 BNSS.""An SAF ASI has died.

Police teams from Shahpur responded swiftly but could not get past the villagers who blocked their way and refused to release Sunny.The cops called their seniors and SDPO Ankita Sulya arrived with reinforcements around 5pm. For the next two hours, Sulya negotiated with villagers, who eventually relented and unlocked the door of the room where Sunny was being held.""The villagers thought that Sunny was unconscious, but we found he was dead.

A mob of 20 men armed with sticks, swords and knives created terror by vandalising vehicles and beating up people in Vastral on Thursday night.Chaudhari said the houses of six of the arrested accused were found to be constructed illegally and were demolished in the Amraiwadi and Khokhar localities.Family members of the accused created a ruckus, but the police brought them under control and prevented them from hindering the demolition work.Soni, in his complaint, stated that he and his family were celebrating his parents' marriage anniversary. ""Around 9pm, I along with my uncle Kashyapbhai and other family members left in a car to for CTM,"" he stated in the complaint.The complainant stated that while they were passing through Nirant Crossroads, a group of about 20 people armed with sticks, swords, and pipes blocked their car and attacked them. They were stopping passersby and damaging vehicles with their weapons.""We got out of the car to plead with them not to damage our vehicle. However, the group attacked us, threatening to kill us if we resisted.

Later, another video went viral where the 13 accused were paraded in the area, and they were seen pleading and demanding an apology for the incident.On Thursday, a video purportedly of the group attacking passersby and a car also went viral.Krunal Desai, assistant commissioner of police I-Division, said, ""While we were checking their details, it was established that six of the 13 accused were staying in illegally constructed houses. The report was sent to the corporation, and a corporation team, based on the report, carried out the demolition.""The cops registered a case under BNS section 109(1) (attempt to murder), 118(1) (voluntarily causing hurt or grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means), 189(2) (unlawful assembly), 189(4) (unlawful assembly being armed with deadly weapons), 190 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 191(2) (rioting), 191(3) (rioting armed with deadly weapons), 126(2) (wrongful restraint), 324(6) (mischief), 351(3) (criminal intimidation) among others.Cops said that the attack on Thursday night was to establish supremacy in the area by two gangs operating in the area.

UK royal Prince Harry once again is facing deportation possibility as a US court has ruled that Prince Harry's immigration files be disclosed by Tuesday.Judge Carl Nichols has directed the release of documents pertaining to the Duke of Sussex's US visa application, following a Freedom of Information (FOI)request. The conservative Heritage Foundation, a US think-tank, initiated the FOI request, suggesting the duke potentially omitted previous drug use which could have affected his visa eligibility. Court documents dated 15 March show Judge Nichols instructed the US Department of Homeland Security to provide a redacted version by Tuesday, as reported by Sky News.Despite the same judge ruling in September last year that public interest in Harry's immigration records was not substantial, the judge has now revised his position.The Heritage Foundation sought this reversal, questioning Harry's 2020 US entry following his admissions about cocaine, marijuana and psychedelic mushrooms in his book Spare. In his autobiography, Harry revealed: ""cocaine didn't do anything for me"", and added: ""Marijuana is different, that actually really did help me.""The foundation argued that his visa application responses regarding past drug use could raise concerns about governmental procedures. The Department of Homeland Security's lawyers agreed in February to release censored versions, despite previously denying the FOI request. Department lawyer John Bardo stated in court documents that they would remove information deemed withholdable by the Court.Even US President Donald Trump had addressed these concerns surrounding the UK prince and stated to The New York Post in February that he wouldn't deport Harry, saying: ""I'll leave him alone."" He further took a jab at his wife saying, ""He's got enough problems with his wife. She's terrible.""

Serbia: Public outrage on show in historic Belgrade protest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/serbia-public-outrage-on-show-in-historic-belgrade-protest/articleshow/119096597.cms,"(AP photo)

A broader fight against systemic corruption



Inside the Belgrade protest near Parliament



Panic while honoring Novi Sad victims



What comes next?



For two days, citizens poured into Belgrade for the largest protest in modern Serbian history. This occurred despite authorities' efforts to obstruct the demonstrations by halting public transportation.Thousands of students walked into the capital, spreading messages of solidarity through smaller towns along the way. The city's streets were packed, with people occupying several key locations.""I came for my child, for my son, so that his future can be better,"" a young man told DW.Police estimated a peak turnout of 107,000. Arhiv javnih skupova (Archive of Public Gatherings), an NGO which tracks mass gatherings, reported between 275,000 and 325,000 demonstrators — possibly more.The protest was initially organized by students, who have been blockading most state universities for over three months. Professors, teachers, health care workers, lawyers, IT professionals, war veterans, bikers and farmers supported the students' call — the farmers arriving on tractors.""We're here to support these brave young people, people who just want to live in a country where the rule of law works, nothing more,"" an elderly protester said.The students primarily demand accountability for the canopy collapse at the Novi Sad railway station in northern Serbia that killed 15 people in November.However, the broader public outrage over systemic corruption is directed toward the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) and President Aleksandar Vucic . Protesters accuse Vucic of consolidating power and dismantling institutions.""This is a rare moment where the whole of Serbia is united under one cause. Even if the country doesn't change after this, we'll know that we stood up together and made our voices heard,"" a young man said at the protest in Belgrade.""Since this started, something has already shifted: a change in collective awareness. It's not enough, but it's a fantastic start,"" added a young woman.Despite fears of violence and predictions of storming public buildings, most incidents were isolated. Serbian media reported 22 arrests and 56 injuries. The Interior Ministry acknowledged multiple brawls and attacks on police officers, attributing them to protesters attempting to provoke disorder.The most intense standoff occurred between the Serbian Parliament building and the Novi Dvor, the president's office. Pro-government counterprotesters, calling themselves ""Students 2.0"" or ""Students who want to study,"" had set up a camp guarded by tractors and police cordons. Rumors circulated that hooligans and former members of the disbanded Special Operations Unit (JSO), whose commanders were convicted of war crimes, were stationed within the camp, raising fears of provocations.Student organizers relocated the main protest location to avoid clashes, but a group remained near the counterprotest camp. Tensions simmered throughout the day, with firecrackers, flares and loud bangs echoing, and both sides threw bottles and stones.At one point, a group of protesters tried to dismantle the barricades around the Parliament building but were pushed back by police. Student marshals, wearing yellow vests, symbolically raised them in the air to indicate they no longer ensured the crowd's safety, urging people to leave.The most alarming moment occurred during a 15-minute silence to honor the victims of the station collapse. A loud, unexpected noise described by witnesses as resembling a projectile or crashing aircraft, caused panic and triggered a brief stampede. Videos on social media captured the crowd scattering in fear.Dušan Simin, who was among the crowd, told DW that it ""sounded like a plane was landing from the direction of the Presidency building.""""We couldn't run away from it — we didn’t know what to do. You don’t know if something will fall on your head or hit you from the side,"" Simin said.""People must have instinctively thought something was coming down the street, so they started running to the side, and we fell over each other. My wife hit her head on a lamppost. I watched her, but I couldn’t help. We still feel uneasy.""He added that they planned to seek medical attention and that the incident has already been reported to the Belgrade Center for Human Rights, which has called on citizens to reach out if they need free legal assistance.""We will seek justice because what they did is not normal,"" Simin said.Balkan news broadcaster N1 quoted military analyst Aleksandar Radic , who suggested an acoustic weapon, specifically a ""sonic cannon"" reportedly available to Serbian security forces, caused the sound. An opposition lawmaker echoed this claim, but police swiftly denied deploying any such device.Political analyst Dusan Spasojevic described the protest as the largest since Serbia transitioned to parliamentary democracy. However, he noted a lack of political strategy, leaving the movement vulnerable to misdirection.""It's clear students aren't sure how to intensify the protest from here. There were no clear announcements about what's next. Meanwhile, some protesters stayed on the streets, wanting more, but without knowing what or how to achieve it,"" Spasojevic told DW.President Vucic expressed satisfaction with the protests in a press conference after the demonstrations and praised the security forces for preserving ""peace and stability.""""All people in power must understand the message when such a large number of people gather. We will have to change ourselves, and we will have to learn a lot,"" he stated.""On the other hand, I hope that some others have clearly understood the message from the majority of Serbia: that the citizens of Serbia do not want color revolutions, that the citizens of Serbia do not want violence, and that the citizens of Serbia want to change their government through elections.""Spasojevic said that the president's satisfaction with the protests is expected because he has had enough incidents to discuss, but just enough that his power remains unaffected.As of now, students have not announced further actions, nor the operationalization of the general strike that was part of the protest plan revealed to the public before the protests. The only certainty is that the movement isn’t retreating. Protesters are left to find new ways to maintain pressure.If it turns out that the authorities did indeed use a sound cannon against the citizens, Spasojevic said this could serve as an additional catalyst for the protests.""That's the kind of unnecessary overreach that fuels protests. Some people left disappointed, but they also left angrier than before, furious that illegal force might have been used against them. That could backfire on the authorities.""","Thousands of citizens poured into Belgrade for the largest protest in modern Serbian history.

Issuing a stark warning to the middle eastern country, Trump demanded that its backing of the rebels “must end immediately.” The strikes resulted in 31 deaths, according to a Houthi health official.Speaking on Sunday, Revolutionary Guards chief Hossein Salami rejected Trump’s warnings, stating in a televised speech: “Iran will not wage war, but if anyone threatens, it will give appropriate, decisive and conclusive responses.” He described the Houthis as “the representative of the Yemenis” and insisted that they made their ""strategic and operational decisions"" independently.This latest escalation comes against the long-standing tensions between the two nations. During Trump’s first term, in January 2020, the US killed Qassem Soleimani, commander of the Guards’ foreign operations unit, in a drone strike in Baghdad. Iran responded by launching missile attacks on bases in Iraq housing American and coalition troops. While no US personnel were killed, Washington reported that dozens suffered traumatic brain injuries.Earlier on Sunday, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei condemned the US air strikes, calling them a “brutal” act and a “gross violation of the principles of the UN Charter.”Iran’s top diplomat, Abbas Araghchi, also took aim at Washington, saying it had ""no authority"" over Iran’s foreign policy.“The United States Government has no authority, or business, dictating Iranian foreign policy,"" Araghchi wrote on X, urging the US to “stop the killing of Yemeni people.” He added that the era of Washington influencing Tehran’s decisions ended with the 1979 Islamic Revolution.The Houthis, who have controlled large parts of Yemen for more than a decade, are part of the so-called “axis of resistance,” an alliance of pro-Iran factions that strongly oppose both Israel and the United States. The group has carried out attacks on Israel and Red Sea shipping throughout the Gaza war, citing solidarity with Palestinians.Saturday’s US air strikes marked the first American military action against the Houthis since Trump’s return to the White House in January.","Iran's Revolutionary Guards have warned of a ""decisive"" response to any attack following US President Donald Trump's air strikes against Yemen's Houthi rebels.

Tornadoes tore through parts of the US, leaving a trail of destruction as powerful storms moved east into the Mississippi Valley and Deep South on Saturday. At least 17 people have died, with Missouri experiencing the highest toll, as officials confirmed 11 fatalities from overnight twisters.The Missouri State Highway Patrol confirmed multiple injuries alongside the fatalities. ""It was unrecognisable as a home.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a post on X. Both Sanders and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp declared states of emergency.The severe weather system brought destructive winds to the Mississippi Valley and Deep South on Saturday. The Missouri State Highway Patrol reported two adult deaths in Bakersfield, Ozark County, with multiple injuries.Coroner Jim Akers reported one death early Saturday after a tornado destroyed a home approximately 177 kilometres east of Bakersfield. These casualties occurred as a substantial weather system crossed the country, generating winds that caused fatal dust storms and intensified over 100 wildfires.Severe weather conditions, including hurricane-force winds, were expected to affect regions inhabited by more than 100 million people. Forecasts predicted winds reaching 130 kph from Canada to Texas, bringing blizzard conditions to northern regions and increased wildfire risks to southern areas.Three people lost their lives on Friday in vehicular accidents during an Amarillo County dust storm in Texas, according to Sgt Cindy Barkley. One incident involved approximately 38 vehicles.""It's the worst I've ever seen,"" Barkley said, describing the near-zero visibility as a nightmare. ""We couldn't tell that they were all together until the dust kind of settled,"" he added.Cave City, Arkansas reported five injuries, prompting Mayor Jonas Anderson to declare a state of emergency early Saturday.

The State Patrol noted winds strong enough to overturn several lorries, the Associated Press reported.Weather specialists noted that March typically experiences such extreme conditions. ""What's unique about this one is its large size and intensity,"" said Bill Bunting of the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Centre in Norman, Oklahoma.""And so what that is doing is producing really substantial impacts over a very large area,"" he added.The Storm Prediction Centre issued warnings about rapidly moving storms capable of producing tornadoes and large hailstones comparable to baseballs.

The severe weather system threatened eastern Louisiana, western Georgia, central Tennessee and the western Florida Panhandle with potential storms and tornadoes.Multiple wildfires emerged across the Southern Plains amidst dry conditions and powerful winds.

The administration plans to move around 300 alleged gang members to detention facilities in El Salvador, raising human rights concerns. Broader immigration crackdown: This move signals Trump’s intent to aggressively pursue stricter immigration policies, potentially setting the stage for broader crackdowns in a second term.

President Donald Trump on Saturday, invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, claiming the US was facing an invasion by a Venezuelan gang. The law, originally meant for wartime, gives the president broad powers, allowing him to speed up mass deportations of undocumented immigrants—potentially escalating his immigration crackdown.The declaration specifically addresses Tren de Aragua , which Trump alleges is operating as a hostile entity under Venezuelan government direction.""Over the years, Venezuelan national and local authorities have ceded ever-greater control over their territories to transnational criminal organizations, including TdA,"" Trump's statement read, the Associated Press reported.""The result is a hybrid criminal state that is perpetrating an invasion of and predatory incursion into the United States, and which poses a substantial danger to the United States,"" it added.This came the same day, a federal judge in Washington prohibited the administration from deporting five Venezuelans under the anticipated order, indicating potential legal challenges ahead.The federal judge's intervention to prevent the deportation of five Venezuelans using the Alien Enemies Act sparked immediate legal confrontations, even before the president's formal announcement.Trump had previously indicated his intention to utilise the 1798 Act, which was last implemented during World War 2 to authorise Japanese-American civilian internment.The American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward submitted an urgent lawsuit in Washington's federal court. They argued that the order would classify Tren de Aragua as a ""predatory incursion"" by a foreign government, potentially leading to indiscriminate deportation of Venezuelans.DC Circuit Chief Judge James E Boasberg issued a temporary restraining order, valid for 14 days, to protect five Venezuelans in immigration custody who were believed to face imminent deportation under the act.Boasberg implemented the order to maintain current circumstances and scheduled a subsequent hearing to consider extending protection to all Venezuelans in the United States.The Trump administration subsequently challenged the initial restraining order, arguing that preventing presidential action before its announcement would severely restrict executive branch operations.The Justice Department's appeal warned that allowing such orders could enable district courts to obstruct crucial national security actions upon receiving complaints. They suggested this could affect operations like drone strikes, intelligence activities, or terrorist apprehensions, urging the court to prevent such precedent.The Alien Enemies Act, part of the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798, is a law designed for use during wartime or when the US faces an imminent threat of invasion by a foreign nation.The act grants the President the authority to detain or deport foreign nationals from enemy countries during periods of conflict, particularly targeting recent immigrants who could be perceived as aligning with US adversaries.According to CNN, legal experts argue that invoking the act outside of wartime—such as citing threats from gangs or cartels—would be legally challenging unless the US is under direct attack by a foreign government.The Alien Enemies Act has been invoked three times in US history, each during wartime, as noted by the Brennan Center.

US govt deports migrants even as a federal judge orders removals be stopped,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-govt-deports-migrants-even-as-a-federal-judge-orders-removals-be-stopped/articleshow/119095222.cms,"TOI correspondent from Washington: In an escalating executive vs judiciary battle that began at 2am EST Saturday, a federal judge directed US govt to turn around flights carrying illegal immigrants that were already in the air after President Donald Trump invoked a 1798 law to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members.Judge James Boasberg, chief judge in the nation’s capital, blocked Trump officials from deporting five Venezuelans — later expanding it to all deportees — under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act proclamation that the US president invoked on Friday, saying they could face persecution and worse in their home country. The judge said he heard that “flights are actively departing” and ordered officials to turn around those already airborne. AP said Boasberg verbally ordered the planes be turned around, but they apparently were not and he did not include the directive in his written order. Officials too said deportations took place despite the judge’s ruling. Secretary of state Marco Rubio wrote on X that the US “sent 2 dangerous top MS-13 leaders plus 21 of its most wanted back to face justice in El Salvador.” “Also, as promised by @POTUS, we sent over 250 alien enemy members of Tren de Aragua, which El Salvador has agreed to hold in their very good jails at a fair price that will also save our taxpayer dollars.” El Salvador confirmed the arrival.In an extraordinary outburst echoing the charges against a self-deporting Indian scholar Ranjani Srinivasan, who was described as a terrorist sympathiser, a Trump administration official then accused the judge of supporting terrorists. “Tonight, a DC trial judge supported Tren de Aragua terrorists over the safety of Americans.... This order disregards well-established authority regarding President Trump’s power, and it puts the public and law enforcement at risk,” attorney general Pam Btondi said.The Act deployed by Trump has been used only three times before to bar citizens of hostile enemy govts to US — the last time during WWII when Washington incarcerated more than 100,000 US citizens of Japanese and Italian origin. The White House in fact invoked the Act on Friday to get around legal hurdles and surreptitiously fly out deportees but activists thwarted the move by moving court late night.The administration said it will appeal the ruling, among several relating to immigration and a raft of other issues that have gone against it, leading to frustration on part of the president and his associates about “activist judges” who they say need to be impeached for thwarting executive decisions. “We must impeach judges who are grossly undermining the will of the people and destroying America. It is the only way,” said tech honco and a close Trump aide Elon Musk.","Judge James Boasberg, chief judge in the nation’s capital, blocked Trump officials from deporting five Venezuelans.

Did the Trump administration defy court order intentionally? Here's the timeline



When a US federal judge ordered a temporary suspension on the Donald Trump administration's deportation of around 200 alleged members of a Venezuelan gang, the plane carrying them was already over the international waters, Axios reported citing insiders as the Trump administration was accused of defying the court order. "" Court order defied . First of many as I've been warning and start of true constitutional crisis,"" national security attorney Mark S Zaid, a Trump critic, wrote on X, adding that Trump could ultimately get impeached.""This is headed to the Supreme Court. And we're going to win,"" a senior White House official told Axios.El Salvador president Nayib Bukele also maintained that it was too late for the verdict as he wrote: ""Oopsie ... Too late.""White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt defended the deportations, saying Trump was ""using his core powers as president and commander-in-chief to defend the American people from an urgent threat.""Trump on Friday signed an order invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, but it was not publicly announced until Saturday. The wartime authority allows a president to detain or deport citizens of an enemy nation, and has been invoked only three times before -- during major international conflicts, including World War I and II. The Act was invoked so that the members of Tren de Aragua could be deported as Bukele agreed to house prisoners in El Salvador's notorious mega jail with windowless cells.At 2:31 p.m. Saturday, an immigration activist who tracks deportation flights, posted on X that ""TWO HIGHLY UNUSUAL ICE flights"" were departing from Texas to El Salvador. The court order came hours later. ""This is something that you need to make sure is complied with immediately,"" he told the Justice Department, according to the Washington Post. At that time, around 6.51pm, both the flights were off Yucatan Peninsula, Axios reported.""They were already outside of US airspace.

Trump envoy on his meeting with Putin

This Week

President Donald Trump may speak to Russian leader Vladimir Putin this week, White House special envoy Steve Witkoff said on Sunday, as the US pushes for a quick ceasefire to end the war in Ukraine.“I expect that there’ll be a call with both presidents this week,” Witkoff said on CNN’s. “And we’re also continuing to engage and have conversation with the Ukrainians.”Witkoff met with Putin in Moscow last week for talks. But the Russian leader balked at a US appeal for an immediate ceasefire, saying instead that issues still need to be resolved. Ukraine agreed to the terms of the truce deal in a meeting earlier in the week with US officials in Saudi Arabia.Still, Witkoff said his conversation with Putin “was positive, it was a solution-based discussion.” He added that he believes Putin “accepts the philosophy of President Trump,” and that both leaders want the war to end.Trump “really expects there to be some sort of deal in the coming weeks and I believe that’s the case,” Witkoff said.US National Security Advisor Mike Waltz told ABC’sthat while Putin “will absolutely consider a ceasefire, there are some other things that he would like to see that President Trump’s national security team is considering over the coming days.”“This is going to be some type of territory for future security guarantees, the future status of Ukraine,” he said. “We know the components. There is a deal that will be had here.”Ukraine has sought assurances that the US and other allies will protect it in the event of a future Russian attack, but the White House has been reluctant to commit to that.Trump’s push for a ceasefire has been controversial, sparking anger in Kyiv and across Europe that the US may be trying to force Ukraine to capitulate to the Russians. The US president has pressured the Ukrainians with a pause in arms shipments and intelligence sharing.Trump, who called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy a “dictator,” has said the Ukrainians are more difficult to deal with than the Russians. And senior US officials have said it’s necessary to talk to both sides in order to bring peace to the battlefield after three years of war.On Friday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin had asked Witkoff to convey messages to Trump ahead of a possible phone call and added there was “cautious optimism” about the prospect of a ceasefire deal, according to the Interfax news agency.","President Donald Trump may speak to Russian leader Vladimir Putin this week.

"Trump cracks down on US-funded media groups; all of VOA's 1,300 staff put on leave",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-cracks-down-on-us-funded-media-groups-all-of-voas-1300-staff-put-on-leave/articleshow/119087008.cms,"<p>Voice of America's parent, the US Agency for Global media is an organisation with a budget of around $270 million and more than 2,000 employees<br></p>

President Donald Trump's administration on Saturday began making deep cuts to Voice of America and other government-run, pro-democracy programming, with the organisation's director saying all VOA employees have been put on leave. On Friday night, shortly after Congress passed its latest funding bill, Trump directed his administration to reduce the functions of several agencies to the minimum required by law.That included the US Agency for Global Media , which houses Voice of America, Radio Free Europe and Asia and Radio Marti, which beams Spanish-language news into Cuba.On Saturday morning, Kari Lake , the failed Arizona gubernatorial and US Senate candidate whom Trump named a senior adviser to the agency, posted on X that employees should check their email. That coincided with notices going out placing Voice of America staff on paid administrative leave.""For the first time in 83 years, the storied Voice of America is being silenced,"" Michael Abramowitz, the organisation's director, said in a statement. He added that ""virtually"" the entire 1300-person staff was placed on leave.""VOA promotes freedom and democracy around the world by telling America's story and by providing objective and balanced news and information, especially for those living under tyranny,"" Abramowitz said.One reporter, who spoke under the condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to the press, said: ""We expected something like this to happen, and it just happened to be today.""The press advocacy group Reporters Without Borders said it ""condemns this decision as a departure from the US's historic role as a defender of free information and calls on the US government to restore VOA and urges Congress and the international community to take action against this unprecedented move"".The Agency for Global Media also sent notices terminating grants to Radio Free Asia and other programming run by the agency. Voice of America transmits United States domestic news into other countries, often translated into local languages. Radio Free Asia, Europe and Marti beam news into countries with authoritarian regimes in those regions like China, North Korea and Russia.""The cancellation of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty's grant agreement would be a massive gift to America's enemies,"" said the network's President and CEO, Stephen Capus, in a statement.Combined, the networks reach an estimated 427 million people. They date back to the Cold War and are part of a network of government-funded organisations trying to extend US influence and combat authoritarianism that includes USAID, another agency targeted by Trump.The reduction is a dramatic blow at a staple of post-Cold War order that has long had bipartisan support. Voice of America's directors have included Dick Carlson, the father of conservative commentator Tucker Carlson.Thomas Kent, former president and CEO of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, said that Trump's intentions for the agencies are still foggy. Without these news sources, it will be that much harder for the country to get its messages to the world, he said.""Without the international broadcasting , the image of the United States and the Trump administration will be in the hands of others, including the administration's opponents, (and) countries and people who consider the United States an enemy,"" said Kent, an international consultant on media ethics.A video posted on X by Lake on Saturday talked about cost-cutting measures, not mentioning the employees and the mission of Voice of America. Her video was made at a building leased by VOA that Lake described as a waste of money. She said she would try to break the agency's 15-year lease on the building.""We're doing everything we can to cancel contracts that can be cancelled, save more, downsize and make sure there's no misuse of your dollars,"" she said.The letter places employees on administrative leave and says staff would continue to receive pay and benefits ""until otherwise notified"".It ordered employees not to use Agency for Global Media facilities and return equipment like phones and computers.The Trump administration has already made other steps to assert its authority over Voice of America, and this week cancelled contracts that allowed VOA to use material from independent news organisations, such as The Associated Press.The administration has also banned the AP from press pools that cover the president and moved to take charge of what news organisations are members of the pools, and the FCC is investigating news organisations like CBS.Trump's order requiring reductions also includes several other, lesser-known government agencies such as the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars, a nonpartisan think tank, the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness and the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund.","Voice of America's parent, the US Agency for Global media is an organisation with a budget of around $270 million and more than 2,000 employees.

Qatal was brain behind Jan ’23 Rajouri attack that killed 7



Abu Qatal enjoyed heavy security cover comprising Pak army



NEW DELHI: Top Lashkar-e-Taiba commander Abu Qatal aka Qatal Sindhi, was gunned down by unidentified assailants in Pakistan’s Jhelum Sindh on Saturday night. One of the closest confidantes of LeT founder Hafiz Saeed , Qatal was the chief operational commander of the terror outfit, notorious for masterminding multiple attacks in J&K.Qatal was wanted by Indian law enforcement after his role in last year’s attack on a pilgrims’ bus returning from a temple in Reasi surfaced.Top Lashkar-e-Taiba commander Abu Qatal aka Qatal Sindhi enjoyed heavy security cover comprising the Pakistan army and operatives of LeT.On Saturday, Qatal and Saeed were returning after meeting the Mangla Corps commander of Pakistan army when the gunmen struck. “They were ambushed near Zeenat Hotel, close to Dina Punjab University in the Jhelum area around 7 pm. Saeed’s vehicle narrowly escaped the attack. The assailants opened fire, killing Qatal and one of his henchman on the spot, while another guard was critically injured and succumbed to injuries later,” a source said.Pakistan’s law enforcement termed the deaths a “targeted killing”. Sources said the killing was the result of infighting in Lashkar ranks. The shooting ends the pause in mysterious killings of terrorists in Pakistan who were high on India’s ‘persons of interest’ list.Qatal was born Zia-ur-Rehman but rode high on the notoriety chart as Qatal Sindhi, the operational ID assigned to him because of his involvement in terror activities dating back to 2002 03. Of late, the notorious terrorist was operating through proxy outfits like People’s Anti-Fascist Force (PAFF) and The Resistant Force (TRF) — the choice of nomenclature a shrewd camouflage for the jihadi outfit and aimed at currying favour with international human rights groups.National Investigation Agency (NIA) has also implicated Qatal, along with four other Lashkar operatives, in its chargesheet on the Rajouri terror attack case. On Jan 1, 2023, terrorists had launched a devastating assault on Dhangri village in Rajouri, killing seven people.“He, along with Saifullah Sajid Jutt, was the main handler of LeT terrorists operating in Poonch-Rajouri region. Qatal was also in charge of Khuiratta camp of LeT, located in Kotli district of Pakistan-occupied J&K,” an official said.As the main link between LeT cadres and operators in PoJK and Sindh province, Qatal played a crucial role in coordinating terror activities. He was also the most trusted handler of Saeed, who often relied on Qatal to maintain control over LeT detachments in PoJK, the source said.Qatal’s associates, Riyaz Ahmed and Hanzla Adnan, were killed in separate incidents in Pakistan in Sept and Dec 2023 respectively.Qatal had infiltrated the Jammu region in the early 2000s and had established a wide network of overground workers in Poonch and Rajouri through his old contacts. His role in various terror incidents was clearly established in investigations conducted by NIA.Saeed’s aide was also the mastermind of the Reasi bus attack on June 9, 2024, which killed nine pilgrims and injured 41. The bus, travelling from Shiv Khori temple to Katra, was ambushed with a barrage of gunfire, causing it to veer off the road and plummet into a deep gorge near Teryath village in Reasi’s Pouni area. This brazen attack was orchestrated under the leadership of Qatal.He was also involved in Bhatta-Durian terror incident, which resulted in the killing of five Army personnel, and the Kandi attack on officers and personnel of 9-Para Special Forces. His killing is significant, given his role in planning and executing terror attacks. Though it may disrupt Lashkar’s operations, the group is adept at adapting and has often overcome setbacks.He enjoyed heavy security cover comprising the Pakistan army and operatives of LeT. On Saturday evening, Qatal and Saeed were returning after meeting the Mangla Corps commander of Pakistan army when the gunmen struck. “They were ambushed near Zeenat Hotel, close to Dina Punjab University in the Jhelum area around 7pm.
