Pakistan reporter questions US spokesperson about 'Kanwar Yatra' row. His response,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-reporter-questions-us-spokesperson-about-kanwar-yatra-row-his-response/articleshow/112001156.cms,"The US state department spokesperson, Matthew Miller, addressed the issue of ""nameplates in Kanwar Yatra "" on Thursday, alleging that the Supreme Court's order was not currently in effect.Responding to a question by a Pakistani journalist, Miller said that the US was aware of the reports.""We have seen those reports. We have also seen reports that the Indian Supreme Court on July 22 issued an interim stay on the implementation of those rules.So they're not actually in effect,"" news agency ANI quoted Miller as saying.""Speaking generally, we are always committed to promoting and protecting universal respect for the right of freedom of religion and belief for all anywhere in the world. And we have engaged with our Indian counterparts on the importance of equal treatment for members of all religions,"" Miller added.Earlier this week, the Supreme Court halted Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and other state governments from enforcing their order that required shop owners and hawkers along the Kanwar Yatra routes to display their names and those of their staff members. The court stated that only the type of food served should be mentioned. Notices were issued to the governments of UP, MP, Uttarakhand, and Delhi, seeking their responses by July 26, when the case will be heard again.The court ordered, ""We deem it appropriate to pass interim order prohibiting the enforcement of the impugned directives.In other words, the food sellers (including dhaba owners, restaurants, foods and vegetable sellers, hawkers, etc) may be required to display the kind of food that they are serving to the kanwariyas. But they must not be forced to display the name/identity of the owners and the employees deployed in their respective establishments.""The bench expressed its initial disagreement with the directives issued by the state authorities. It stated that while the authorities can ensure that the kanwariyas are served vegetarian food that meets their preferences and hygienic standards, potentially through orders under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, and the Street Vendors Act, 2014, the police cannot usurp the legal powers vested in the competent authority without a legal foundation.(With agency inputs)","US state department spokesperson, Matthew Miller, addressed the issue of ""nameplates in Kanwar Yatra "" on Thursday, alleging that the Supreme Court's order was not currently in effect.

Musk's decision to relocateSpaceX headquarters to Texas, citing a new California law limiting parental notification of a child's gender identity change, further underscores these divisions.Musk's pledge to take on the ""woke"" left likely inspired his latest decision to move the California headquarters for SpaceX to Texas, after Gov.

At least 18 bodies were recovered from the small plane that caught fire after skidding off the runway during takeoff from Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu on Wednesday.The sole survivor of the crash was the pilot, who was transported to Kathmandu Medical College Hospital for treatment. According to a doctor cited by AP, the pilot sustained injuries to the eyes but is not in any danger.The aircraft, operated by local carrier Saurya Airlines , was en route to Pokhara city carrying two crew members and 17 technicians for maintenance checks, as said by airport security chief Arjun Chand Thakuri.The cause of the slip remains unclear.""The plane skidded off the runway and crashed into a field east of the runway,"" Thakuri told Reuters. Emergency responders quickly extinguished the fire that erupted from the crash.Television footage showed firefighters battling the blaze as thick black smoke billowed into the sky. Other visuals captured rescue workers sifting through the charred remains of the plane, scattered across lush green fields. Bodies were seen being carried to ambulances on stretchers, with local residents looking on.Tribhuvan International Airport, the primary hub for international and domestic flights in Nepal , has been closed as emergency crews continue their work. Despite the monsoon season in Kathmandu, it was not raining at the time of the crash, though visibility was low across the capital.Saurya Airlines, which operates domestic flights within Nepal, uses two Bombardier CRJ-200 regional jets, both around 20 years old, according to Flight Radar 24.Nepal's air safety record has faced significant scrutiny in recent years. In 2019, a Bangladeshi airliner crashed at Tribhuvan airport, resulting in 51 fatalities while 20 survived. An investigation revealed the plane was misaligned with the runway and the pilot was disoriented, attempting to land in “sheer desperation.”Similarly, in 2015, a Turkish Airlines jet skidded off a slippery runway at the same airport while landing in dense fog. Although the plane was carrying 238 people, no serious injuries were reported.","A small plane skidded off the runway during takeoff from Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu on Wednesday.

Noa Argamani: Who is former Hamas captive Noa Argamani? Why is her Washington trip being criticised?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-former-hamas-captive-noa-argamani-why-is-her-washington-trip-being-criticised/articleshow/111994593.cms,"Noa Argamani , a former Hamas hostage, recently shared her harrowing experience with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a meeting in Washington, DC. According to the Times of Israel, Argamani, who was held captive for eight months, recounted her most difficult moment: hearing Netanyahu announce that the war would be prolonged. She told the Prime Minister, ""The hardest moment I had in captivity was when I listened to the radio and heard you say the war will be long.I thought, 'I won’t get out of here.' It was a breaking point for me.""Argamani, who was rescued from Gaza last month, urged Netanyahu to expedite the release of the remaining 120 hostages, saying, ""I saw death with my eyes,"" and noted that fellow hostages Yossi Sharabi and Itay Svirsky were killed beside her.Her decision to accompany Netanyahu on his U.S. visit has sparked criticism, with some accusing her of bolstering the Prime Minister, whom many blame for not securing the hostages' release sooner. Journalist Uri Misgav wrote: “Noa Argamani and her father should be ashamed until their last day for agreeing to serve as a backdrop for this crazy and smiling couple’s flight, especially on the morning we learned of two more captives who were unlucky enough to die in captivity and not fly to Washington with the captives’ abandoner. A shame like no other.”On the other hand, both coalition and opposition lawmakers condemned the criticism, defending Argamani as a hero and emphasizing the personal nature of her decision.The conflict with Hamas, a designated terrorist organization, has been ongoing, with a particularly brutal escalation on October 7, known as the Hamas-led massacre. This incident involved the capture of several hostages, including Argamani. The war has seen numerous casualties and significant destruction, with ongoing efforts to secure the release of hostages being a critical issue.During his trip to Washington, Netanyahu is meeting with several key figures, including members of the U.S. government and Jewish community leaders. His agenda includes discussions with President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and members of Congress to address the current conflict, seek support for Israel's military and diplomatic efforts, and negotiate for the hostages' release. Netanyahu's meetings aim to reinforce U.S.-Israel relations and garner further international support for Israel's actions against Hamas.Meanwhile, family members of other hostages continue to pressure Netanyahu to finalize a deal with Hamas, with some advocating for increased military pressure to coerce negotiations. The urgency of these efforts is underscored by the ongoing demonstrations and protests by hostage relatives, demanding immediate action to bring their loved ones home safely.","Noa Argamani, a former Hamas hostage, recently shared her harrowing experience with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a meeting in Washington, DC.

'Radical left lunatic ...': Donald Trump targets Kamala Harris at first rally since Biden's exit from 2024 race,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-election-donald-trump-targets-kamala-harris-at-first-rally-since-bidens-exit-from-2024-race-calls-her-radical-left-lunatic/articleshow/112000705.cms,"Former President Donald Trump unleashed a barrage of attacks Wednesday against his likely new opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris , whom he called his “new victim to defeat” and accused of deceiving the public about President Joe Biden ’s ability to run for a second term.The rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, marked his first public campaign event since Biden dropped out of the 2024 matchup and Harris became the Democrats' likely nominee.“So now we have a new victim to defeat: Lyin’ Kamala Harris,” Trump said, labeling her ""the most incompetent and far-left vice president in American history.”Trump called her a “radical left lunatic” and criticized her positions on abortion and immigration. He also mispronounced her first name repeatedly.The former president's stop in North Carolina signals his concern about keeping the state in his column this November, even as his team aims for wins in traditionally Democratic-leaning states like Minnesota, which Trump is set to visit on Saturday.Trump has ramped up his criticism of the vice president since Biden’s abrupt departure, calling Harris “the same as Biden but much more radical.”He has blamed her for what he portrays as the Biden administration’s failures, particularly security along the U.S.-Mexico border. On Wednesday, speakers who appeared on stage before the Republican nominee attacked Harris' record on the border, highlighting her role in leading a White House effort to tackle migration issues. Harris’ name was met with boos several times during the speeches.“She was assigned that, she was given that task, and she failed,” said Brandon Judd, former president of the National Border Patrol Council, the union that represents agents.Trump has also hedged on plans for an expected debate with Harris, first saying he wanted Fox News, not ABC, to host the matchup he had originally scheduled for September with Biden. On Tuesday, Trump appeared to tweak that message again, saying on a call with reporters that he'd like to debate Harris “more than once” but not committing to appearing at the debate currently on the books, stating he had only agreed to debate Biden twice, not Harris.Harris, meanwhile, spent Wednesday in Indiana, telling members of the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta that “we are not playing around” and asked for their help in electing her president in November, an election she characterized as ""a choice between two different visions for our nation, one focused on the future, the other focused on the past.”Voters in Indiana haven’t backed a Democratic presidential candidate in nearly 16 years. But Harris, a woman of Black and South Asian descent, was speaking to a group already excited by her historic status as the likely Democratic nominee, and one that her campaign hopes can expand its coalition.Quietly, Republicans have spoken about how subbing Harris in for Biden nullifies a portion of their party's argument in favor of Trump's vitality and vigor.At 81, Biden would have been the oldest presidential nominee heading into a general election. Now, the 78-year-old Trump occupies that slot. Harris, 59, has launched a campaign that appears to be stoking interest among younger voters who could be key in deciding an anticipated close general election.North Carolina is a state Trump carried in both his previous campaigns but by less than 1.5 percentage points over Biden in 2020, the closest margin of any state Trump won. Trump campaigned heavily in North Carolina even as the Covid-19 pandemic wore on, while Biden largely kept off the physical campaign trail and did not personally visit the state in the last 16 days of the election.Mecklenburg County, home to Charlotte — the state's biggest city — was also the scene of Trump's narrowest margin of victory in North Carolina's GOP primary, edging out Nikki Haley by fewer than 8 percentage points.This year, Trump had planned to hold his first rally since the start of his hush money trial in Fayetteville, but that event was called off due to inclement weather. Trump called in from his private plane instead.Democrats have also been working to win North Carolina, where the party's most recent presidential win was Barack Obama's 2008 victory, despite recent GOP dominance.Biden held a campaign event in Raleigh the day after his disastrous June debate with Trump. While he was much more forceful in that appearance than he was on the debate stage, it did little to quell the growing concern from members of his party about his ability to win the White House again.With Harris now poised to take his spot, she may again turn to North Carolina for some political help: the state's Gov. Roy Cooper is among the Democrats that Harris' campaign is vetting for a possible pick as her vice presidential running mate.Cooper is term-limited and cannot seek reelection. The highly competitive race to replace him pits Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein against Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, a staunch Trump supporter who is North Carolina's first Black major party nominee for governor.Trump's Charlotte event is his second campaign rally since a July 13 assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally. Days later, Trump accepted the GOP presidential nomination and gave a speech at the Republican National Convention, where his ear — injured in the shooting — was bandaged.Wednesday's rally is also the first since the resignation of Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle, who said she took “full responsibility for the security lapse” that led to a gunman getting so close to Trump at the outdoor event in Pennsylvania.The Charlotte rally, like the one over the weekend in Grand Rapids, Michigan, will be held in an indoor arena.",Trump called her a 'radical left lunatic' and mispronounced her first name repeatedly. It was his first public campaign event since Biden dropped out of the 2024 matchup and Harris became the Democrats' likely nominee. The former president's stop in North Carolina signals his concern about keeping the state in his column this November.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112000753,imgsize-2459681,width-400,resizemode-4/112000753.jpg"

Watch: Thousands of Pro-Palestinian protesters condemn Netanyahu’s Washington visit amid Gaza conflict; Police use pepper spray near US Capitol,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/netanyahu-washington-visit-amid-gaza-conflict-pro-palestinian-protest-police-use-pepper-spray-near-us-capitol/articleshow/112000704.cms,"Thousands of protesters gathered in Washington on Wednesday (local time) to condemn Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's visit, chanting “Free, free Palestine” as they marched toward the Capitol before police deployed pepper spray on some in the crowd.Demonstrators , calling for an end to the war that has claimed more than 39,000 Palestinian lives, filled several blocks as they weaved through the streets of the nation’s capital carrying Palestinian flags and signs with messages such as “arrest Netanyahu” and “end all U.S.aid to Israel.” Outside Washington's Union Station, protesters removed American flags and hoisted Palestinian ones in their place to massive cheers from the crowd.“Bibi, Bibi, We’re not done! The intifada has just begun!” protesters shouted, referring to Netanyahu by his nickname. “Netanyahu, you can’t hide. You’re committing genocide,” other protesters chanted.Throngs of demonstrators rallied near the Capitol before starting their march ahead of Netanyahu's joint address to Congress, but police blocked them from getting close to the building. Authorities said they used pepper spray after some protesters became “violent” and “failed to obey” orders to move back from the police line.Before Netanyahu’s speech, some protesters attempted to block his route to the Capitol but were removed from the street by police. After being turned away by officers near the Capitol, protesters wound through the Capitol Hill neighborhood for several blocks before gathering in front of the nearby rail station.Outside Union Station, at least four protesters were handcuffed and taken away by police. Protesters shouted, “Let them go!” at officers who formed a circle. One person grabbed a police officer’s riot shield and then raised his fists in a fighting stance. An officer was seen grabbing a Palestinian flag from a woman and tossing it aside. At least one protester appeared to be overcome by the effects of pepper spray.Cheers rang out as a fire burned what appeared to be a papier-mache likeness of Netanyahu. Protesters spray-painted graffiti on a monument to Christopher Columbus, including the words, “Hamas is coming” in large red letters. “Free Gaza” was scrawled in green.Among the protesters was a group of artists from Baltimore displaying a massive papier-mache sculpture meant to depict President Joe Biden with blood on his hands and devil horns.Mary Kaileh, a Palestinian woman who moved to the U.S. from the West Bank 17 years ago and now lives in Baltimore, said her people have been ignored and mistreated for decades. She’s not convinced protests will change anything in terms of convincing American politicians to act, but she wasn’t about to stay home.“I love it, but I don’t see the effects of it,” she said.While many of the demonstrators have condemned Israel, others have expressed support while pressing Netanyahu to strike a cease-fire deal in the war with Hamas and bring home the hostages still being held by the militant group.Many Jewish Americans view the war in Gaza as justified because it came in response to the brutal Oct. 7 Hamas attack, even if they don’t outright support Netanyahu and his policies. The families of hostages taken by Hamas are also protesting, demanding Netanyahu agree to a cease-fire deal that would free their loved ones.Capitol Police said in a post on X that six people who “disrupted” Netanyahu’s address were removed from the House gallery and arrested.“Disrupting the Congress and demonstrating in the congressional buildings is against the law,” police said.During Netanyahu’s speech, five people wearing yellow T-shirts that read “seal the deal now” were removed from the gallery. The phrase is a rallying cry for those urging Netanyahu to reach a deal to return the hostages. The individuals stood to prominently display the message on their shirts during moments when others were applauding but had done nothing to disrupt the speech itself.Police significantly boosted security around the Capitol and closed multiple roads for most of the week. Workers erected a metal fence around the White House on Wednesday morning while tall steel barriers ringed the Capitol.Dozens of protesters rallied outside Netanyahu’s hotel Monday evening after his arrival in Washington, and on Tuesday afternoon, hundreds of demonstrators staged a flashmob-style protest in the Cannon building, which houses offices of House members.The Capitol Police said about 200 people were arrested Tuesday on charges stemming from the sit-in at the Cannon building. Jewish Voice for Peace, which organized the protest, said many more than that were arrested, rabbis among them.After about a half-hour of protesters' clapping and chanting, officers from the Capitol Police issued several warnings, then began arresting demonstrators — binding their hands with zip ties and leading them away one by one.Families of some of the remaining hostages held a protest vigil Tuesday evening on the National Mall, demanding that Netanyahu come to terms with Hamas and bring home the approximately 120 Israeli hostages remaining in Gaza.Biden and Netanyahu are expected to meet Thursday, according to a US official who spoke on condition of anonymity before a White House announcement. Vice President Kamala Harris will also meet Netanyahu separately that day.Harris, as Senate president, would normally sit behind foreign leaders addressing Congress, but she will be away Wednesday on an Indianapolis trip scheduled before Biden withdrew his reelection bid, which made her the likely Democratic presidential candidate.Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said on Truth Social that he would meet with Netanyahu on Friday.","Police used pepper spray after some protesters became 'violent' and 'failed to obey' orders to move back from the police line. Protesters removed American flags and hoisted Palestinian ones in their place to massive cheers from the crowd. “Bibi, Bibi, We’re not done! The intifada has just begun!” protesters shouted.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112000841,imgsize-395452,width-400,resizemode-4/112000841.jpg"

The suspect, identified as 24-year-old Hadi Matar from Fairview, New Jersey, rushed the stage at the Chautauqua Institution and allegedly stabbed Rushdie in the neck and abdomen.Rushdie, 75, was immediately hospitalized and underwent surgery for his injuries, which included a damaged liver and severed nerves.His agent reported that Rushdie was on a ventilator and would likely lose an eye.The assault occurred as Rushdie was being introduced to the audience for a lecture on offering asylum to artists. Witnesses described the attacker repeatedly striking Rushdie before being subdued by authorities.Matar was swiftly arrested at the scene.An indictment unsealed in U.S. District Court in Buffalo on Wednesday charges Hadi Matar with providing material support to Hezbollah, a militant group based in Lebanon and backed by Iran. The indictment didn't detail what evidence linked Matar to the group.The federal charge comes after Matar earlier this month rejected an offer by state prosecutors to recommend a shorter prison sentence if he agreed to plead guilty in Chautauqua County Court, where he is charged with attempted murder and assault. The agreement also would have required him to plead guilty to a federal terrorism-related charge, which hadn't been filed yet at the time.Instead, both cases will now proceed to trial separately. Jury selection in the state case is set for Oct. 15.Rushdie's controversial novel ""The Satanic Verses,"" published in 1988, sparked outrage in the Muslim world and led to a fatwa, or religious decree, from the late Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran calling for his death.","Hadi Matar, 24, charged with providing material support to Hezbollah, a militant group based in Lebanon and backed by Iran.

Now, the choice is up to you, the American people,” Biden said, emphasizing his confidence in Harris as she steps into the role of the Democratic frontrunner.Biden went on to recognize, “there’s a time and a place for new voices, fresh voices, yes — younger voices.”Biden's speech focused on the future of the country, with the president expressing gratitude for Harris’s contributions and urging voters to support her in the upcoming election. “In just a few months, the American people will choose the course of America’s future.

'Miracle': Gaza baby saved from dead mother's womb after Israeli airstrike,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/miracle-gaza-baby-saved-from-dead-mothers-womb-after-israeli-airstrike/articleshow/112001389.cms,"Women and children suffer the most in the wars men start. A heart-wrenching incident in Gaza has once again highlighted this, where a baby boy survived after his mother died in an Israeli air strike.Ola Al-Kurd, nine months pregnant, eagerly waited for the arrival of her baby, hoping to bring new life to Gaza amidst a war that has claimed the lives of over 39,000 Palestinians and devastated much of the enclave.""She wanted to hold her child and fill our home with his presence,"" Ola's father Adnan Al-Kurd said. Tragically, Ola never experienced that precious moment. On July 19, an Israeli airstrike hit the family home in Al-Nuseirat, central Gaza, according to her father Adnan Al-Kurd. The explosion threw Ola several floors down, causing her death in the house that sheltered women, children, and the elderly.Miraculously, her baby and husband survived, with the latter being hospitalized. ""It's a miracle that the fetus stayed alive inside of her when she was martyred (died),"" Adnan Al-Kurd remarked, reflecting on a photo of his daughter's graduation.The explosion, like countless others, claimed the lives of multiple family members, a daily occurrence in Gaza since Israel launched its offensive in response to a cross-border attack by Palestinian Hamas militants on October 7 last year.Despite numerous attempts by mediators from the United States, Qatar, and Egypt, a ceasefire remains difficult to achieve, making it highly improbable that Israeli airstrikesand shelling will stop in the near future.Against all odds, surgeons at Al Awda hospital in Nuseirat, where Ola was initially taken after the strike, successfully delivered the newborn, Malek Yassin. The baby was then transferred to Al Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah, where an aunt gently touched his face as he rested in an incubator.""Thank God, this baby's life was saved and he is now alive and well,"" news agency Reuters reported doctor Khalil Al-Dakran as saying at the hospital, where many medical facilities have been destroyed during the nine-month war.Al-Kurd looks at photos of his three late children killed in the Gaza war , noting that baby Yassin shares the same blond hair as his deceased uncle Omar. ""I go visit him everyday. He is a part of me,"" he said.Infants who survive the relentless Israeli bombardment find no respite as the conflict continues to wreak havoc in the densely populated Gaza Strip.""We are in fact facing very great difficulties in the nursery department,"" said Al-Dakran, citing a shortage of essential medication and supplies, as well as concerns that the hospital generator could fail at any moment due to fuel scarcity.Throughout impoverished Gaza, hospitals have been demolished or severely damaged during the war, which erupted when Hamas-led fighters attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking over 250 hostages, according to Israeli accounts.Israel countered with an air and ground offensive that has claimed the lives of more than 39,000 Palestinians, as reported by Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, and has flattened much of the coastal territory.""What is the fault of this child to start his life under difficult and very bad circumstances, deprived of the most basic necessities of life?""

Speaking three days after launching her campaign, Harris contrasted two visions for America and emphasised her commitment to the future with the support of the sorority.""In this moment, I believe we face a choice between two different visions for our nation, one focused on the future, the other focused on the past,"" Harris said.""And with your support, I am fighting for our nation's future.""Indiana has not supported a Democratic presidential candidate for nearly 16 years. However, Harris, who is of Black and South Asian descent, spoke to a group already motivated by her historic candidacy.

""And now, in this moment, our nation needs your leadership once again,"" she said.Challenges remain for Democrats, as the nation faces frustration over high prices following a spike in inflation. Additionally, Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, survived a recent assassination attempt, further energising his base. The memo expressed more optimism compared to the outlook after the 81-year-old Biden's poor debate performance in June. Biden withdrew from the race on Sunday.Harris mentioned that Biden would address the nation on Wednesday regarding his decision to step aside and praised him as a 'leader with a bold vision.""We are all deeply, deeply grateful for his service to our nation,"" she said before contrasting the current administration's agenda with Trump's.""These extremists want to take us back, but we are not going back,"" she stated. ""All across our nation we are witnessing a full-on assault on hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights.""She listed the rights in question, including the freedom to vote, to be safe from gun violence, to love openly, to 'learn and acknowledge our true and full history,' and the freedom 'of a woman to make decisions about her body and not have her government telling her what to do.'Trump delivered a series of attacks on Harris during a rally in Charlotte, labelling her his 'new victim to defeat.' He accused her of misleading the public about Biden's health and called her ""Lyin' Kamala,"" while mispronouncing her first name. He further described her as 'the most incompetent and far-left vice president in American history.'Harris later traveled to Houston on Wednesday, where she visited the city's emergency operations center to discuss recovery efforts following Hurricane Beryl and to thank emergency personnel.

Harris also aims to be competitive in other states, including North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada.For Democrats, the support of Black women could be crucial in November, and Harris has shown signs of galvanizing their support.During the 2020 election, AP VoteCast found that Black women made up just 7% of the electorate. However, 93% of them voted for Biden, contributing to his narrow victories in states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Georgia.Following Harris's campaign announcement, around 90,000 Black women joined a campaign video call on Sunday night.

'I'm not moving'

STAROKOSTIANTYNIV: With its castle, medieval tower and river-side beach, the western Ukrainian tourist town of Starokostiantyniv doesn't seem an obvious target for Russian missile and drone strikes.But a major airbase across the Sluch river has put the town firmly in Russia 's sights -- and locals fear the imminent arrival of F-16 fighter jets in Ukraine will only intensify the bombardments .""We're super nervous about the arrival of the F-16s. If they park them here, the number of attacks will only go up,"" said Olena Shpachenko, a guide at the town's history museum, located inside the 17th-century castle.Kyiv says the advanced US-made fighters, some already being transferred to Ukraine, will help it better protect its skies and compete with Russia for air superiority.Russia has intensified its bombing of Ukrainian air bases -- including Starokostiantyniv, home to the seventh tactical aviation bridge -- and pledged to target F-16s.In a show of force earlier this month, Moscow hit three Ukrainian airfields in as many days.""From here we have a good view of the explosions,"" said Shpachenko, gesturing out of the castle window.""We hear them as if we were right there,"" she told AFP.For more than two years, she has watched the enemy's explosive drones and supersonic missiles pepper the sky at night.Pointing to a row of partially damaged ancient religions icons hanging over her desk, she said the air base was ""so close, the missiles can make it all the way over here.""Ukraine and its Western partners have not given any official indication of where the F-16s will be based.A Western defence industry source told AFP the Starokostiantyniv airfield -- equipped with Soviet-era partially underground shelters -- is an ideal candidate.Residents, used to the roar of jets even before the war , say tensions in the city are ratcheting up.""The authorities held a large-scale exercise in the event of a nuclear strike. They believe the base is a prime target for Moscow,"" said Shpachenko.""We pray that the F-16s don't wind up here,"" she added, looking anxiously outside once more.Even if Ukraine's air defences intercept Russian missiles targeting the base, ""debris will rain down on the city,"" she feared.She has forbidden her daughters from playing outside.Despite being hundreds of kilometres from the front lines, the war literally hangs over the town that locals call ""Starkon"".The smell of powder and kerosene punctuate the air and the sky is strewn with black contrails left behind by the jets.Large tanks of jet fuel are hidden in the surrounding woods, where groups of soldiers were playing cards in a moment of respite.The town's lights are turned off at night and the troops scour the sky, ready to shoot down drones with machine guns.Anatoliy, the commander of a mobile anti-aircraft unit, said Russia had stepped up attacks over the past month.""The Russians are now using cluster munitions with the aim of damaging the jets on the ground,"" he said, puffing on a cigarette.The explosives can target areas covering thousands of square metres with a single drop.Asked if he thought the escalation was due to the possible arrival of the F-16s, Anatoliy hesitated, before smiling: ""The Russians, those fools, will never guess where they are.""The war has also taken its toll on the town's previously vibrant tourism industry.""The soldiers, the attacks... it discourages people from coming. We've even had drone debris fall on the beach, Shpachenko said.One family of vacationers ""heard a plane flying close to the ground, dropped their stuff and ran to the castle,"" she said.Many of the Ukrainians who came to Starokostiantyniv after fleeing their homes in the east left as soon as they heard the first roar of a fighter plane.""The desire to survive is stronger than the need for rest,"" said Shpachenko.Despite the danger, some locals were outside, relaxing in the shade of the weeping willows or on the small beach.Valery, in his 70s, has been here so long he knows the engine noises of the different planes by heart.He still goes for a morning swim in the river at the foot of the castle every day.""I'm afraid of the arrival of the F-16s.

US election: Kamala Harris’ Indian heritage is deeply felt if little advertised,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-election-kamala-harris-indian-heritage-is-deeply-felt-if-little-advertised/articleshow/112001982.cms,"To most who saw the quotation being circulated this week as a meme, it was just something funny that Kamala Harris said in a speech in 2023: “You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?”But for many Indians and Indian Americans , the line, which Harris attributed to her mother, is layered with extra meaning. Tamil Nadu, the South Indian state where her mother’s family is from, is one of India’s largest growers of coconut palms.It’s also the kind of thing an Indian parent might say.Harris, the vice president and Democratic candidate for president, neither advertises nor shies away from her Indian heritage . She slips in references to it. She also deploys it strategically.Last year, Harris spoke of her deep personal connection to India at a luncheon in Washington for Narendra Modi, the Indian prime minister, whom the United States has been courting. Harris’ introduction to the concepts of equality, freedom and democracy came from her Indian grandfather, she said, with whom she went on long walks during her visits to Chennai, India.“It is these lessons I learned at a very young age that first inspired my interest in public service,” she said.Harris grew up in California, the daughter of an Indian mother and Jamaican father, and she identifies as Black and South Asian.In India, her sudden elevation to likely presidential nominee after President Joe Biden’s exit from the race has added to a general sense of pride in the country’s rise in global stature. But Indian news coverage has not focused much on her Indian heritage. While Harris maintains family ties in Tamil Nadu and has talked about her visits every other year to India as a child, she has not made any official trips to India as vice president, and before that had not visited since 2009.Her candidacy resonates more in the Indian American community, even if Harris is seen as identifying more as Black than as Indian. Many Indian Americans see Harris as another example of the diaspora’s success and influence, including in politics, with growing numbers of Indian American lawmakers and candidates at the highest levels. (The five members of the House with Indian roots sometimes use the nickname “samosa caucus.”)When Biden chose Harris as his running mate in 2020, “there was something other than pride,” said Shoba Viswanathan, who oversees civic engagement for Indiaspora, a nonprofit. “She normalizes us, in a way; she is a visible representation of Indians in public service.”If she wins the White House, Harris seems unlikely to vastly reshape American ties to India. She does not share the same personal relationship with Modi that he was widely seen to have with her opponent in the presidential race, Donald Trump. But she would be likely to continue the Biden administration’s broad effort to bring India closer as a counterweight to China, foreign policy experts said.Domestically, her expected nomination would be unlikely to significantly alter the voting pattern of Indian Americans, who already overwhelmingly lean Democratic, said Sanjoy Chakravorty, an author of a 2016 book on the rise of Indian Americans.“Indian Americans are one of the most consistent Democratic voters of any ethnic group,” said Chakravorty, a professor at Temple University. “Will they be proud of Kamala Harris? For sure. Will they look to Trump with fear? For sure. Will they vote for the Democratic Party? Guaranteed.”While many Indian Americans support Modi, a conservative Hindu nationalist, as a driver of India’s ascent, they are more politically liberal in the American context. Many of them worry about gun violence and immigration policy as well as racist or religious attacks, and they tend to view the Democratic Party as better on those issues, Chakravorty said.Harris’ campaign could benefit financially from Indian Americans, who represent a little over 1% of the U.S. population but are among the wealthiest and most influential diaspora communities. In 2020, the community poured millions of dollars into the Biden Victory Fund, galvanized by Harris’ selection as Biden’s vice presidential pick.In India, much of the focus on Harris’ candidacy has been about where she might take American foreign policy. If she is elected, it could do a lot to ease India’s long-standing suspicions of U.S. intentions in the region, said Gautam Mukunda, a research fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Center for Public Leadership.The idea that “if the Americans are willing to put an Indian American in the White House, they can’t be that bad” could bring the countries closer and alter a relationship that has been more transactional and less about shared values, Mukunda said.Modi, a consummate politician with a flair for showmanship who is determined to transform India into a superpower, did not hesitate to advertise his relationship with Trump when he was in the White House.In 2020, Modi laid out a grand welcome for Trump’s presidential visit to India, arranging for a massive crowd to greet him. The previous year, the two leaders shared the stage at an event in Texas called “Howdy, Modi!” Thousands of Indian Americans had gathered to cheer Modi’s election win that year.Harris and Modi have displayed no such chemistry. In 2019, Harris supported an Indian American House member, Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., when Jayapal urged the Indian government to restore phone lines and internet connections in the disputed territory of Kashmir after Modi abruptly revoked its special status.The resolution angered the Modi government. India’s external affairs minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, refused to attend a meeting with the House Foreign Affairs Committee because Jayapal would be present.If she wins in November, Harris will face a delicate task in navigating the relationship with Modi, said Shubhajit Roy, diplomatic editor of the newspaper The Indian Express.She will have to balance “India’s record on human rights, her thinking on which has been pretty pronounced, and its growing role as a regional and aspirational power that provides an important counterweight to the common China threat,” Roy said. So far, American leaders have tilted much more toward wooing Modi, remaining largely silent as he has demonized India’s 200 million Muslims.For now, though, Harris is focused on her presidential campaign. Her supporters, including Indian Americans, have taken up a social media chant: “In Sanskrit, Kamala means ‘lotus.’ In America, it means POTUS” — president of the United States.They have also embraced the “coconut tree” quote, which Harris used while speaking at an event in May 2023. In making the point that people don’t exist in silos, she borrowed an idiom from her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, who was a breast cancer researcher and died in 2009 at age 71.“My mother used to — she would give us a hard time sometimes, and she would say to us, ‘I don’t know what’s wrong with you young people. You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?’” She added, “You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you.”Initially used by Republicans to mock and exoticize Harris, the line has since become a rallying cry for her supporters, who have gleefully embraced coconut memes, coconut emojis and piña coladas.To Mukunda, the Harvard research fellow, the memes show a growing acceptance of diversity by many Americans that goes beyond the color of a person’s skin to include cultural references and idioms.Coconuts have played another role in Harris’ life. When she was running for California attorney general, Harris asked an aunt who lived in Chennai to break coconuts at a Hindu temple for luck. Coconuts are considered auspicious in Hinduism and are regularly offered to the gods at religious ceremonies.","Kamala Harris is the daughter of an Indian mother and Jamaican father.

Kamala rakes in over $250 million in 3 days since Biden's exit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-rakes-in-over-250-million-in-3-days-since-bidens-exit/articleshow/112001194.cms,"WASHINGTON: The Kamala Harris presidential campaign has raked in more than $250 million in political contributions in the three days since Prez Joe Biden bowed out of the race, a staggering spike that is confounding pundits who thought she would be a weak candidate and Trump would trump her on the money front.Explanations for the windfall in political funding, including over $100 million in the 24 hours since Biden bequeathed the nomination to her, include pent-up energy and money from donors who wanted Biden to bow out.Many Democrat donors dismayed with Biden's debate debacle had held back contributions - in what was dubbed a ""Dembargo"" - to pressure the prez into quitting the race. His exit appears to have uncorked the money spigot.While big donors from Hollywood and Silicon Valley account for a large portion of the windfall, the Harris campaign is also thrilled that 60% of the contributions have come from first-time donors, an indication that a new cohort of voters who did not give to Biden have emerged from the political base. The Harris campaign also reported a surge in volunteer sign-ups, enrolling 58,000 since she replaced the prez at the top of the ticket, a sign-up rate that one report said is 232 times larger than Biden campaign's daily average. This would suggest that many youngsters who had distanced themselves from the battle of geriatrics are now enthused by the much younger Harris, who is 59, and are ""drivin' up the jiving"".Harris also appears to have staunched the money flow to the Trump campaign from Silicon Valley, previously a Democratic redoubt where some principals like Elon Musk decamped to the Republican side expressing dismay over liberal wokism. On Tuesday, Musk dialed back Trump's claim that he (Musk) was going to contribute $45 million a month to his campaign, saying, he doesn't subscribe to ""a cult of personality"". Other Silicon Valley honchos said they are now opening their chequebooks after holding back for weeks because of the uncertainty over whether Biden would continue.One Google executive who plans to hold a fundraiser for Harris - who was born in and grew up in Oakland in California's Bay Area - told Washington Post that a lot of people in the tech world were ""paralysed in the last few weeks"" and ""now we are seeing the floodgates have opened"". But Trump campaign officials maintain it is just a brief bump arising from Harris' elevation, and the industry's mistrust of govt and regulations will be hard to overcome.Incidentally, while California and New York fork out much of the campaign lolly, most of it will be spend - on ads, maintaining campaign offices, voter outreach etc. - in the so-called battleground states that will determine the poll outcome. They include ""Blue Wall"" states - Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania - and the ""Sun Belt"" stretch - Arizona, Nevada, Georgia and North Carolina, all of which Trump and Harris will be traversing soon.","Kamala Harris campaign has raked in more than $250 million in political contributions in the three days since Prez Joe Biden bowed out of the race.

Rushdie, 77, suffered severe injuries, including the loss of sight in his right eye, after being stabbed about ten times by a knife-wielding assailant at an arts event in New York in August 2022.Attorney General Merrick Garland said, ""We allege that in attempting to murder Salman Rushdie in New York in 2022, Hadi Matar committed an act of terrorism in the name of Hezbollah.""Matar could be sentenced to life imprisonment if convicted on the federal terrorism charges brought against him.FBI Director Christopher Wray emphasized that Matar tried to execute a fatwa endorsed by Hezbollah calling for Rushdie's death. Hezbollah is classified as a terrorist organization by the United States, the European Union, Britain, and most members of the Arab League.In addition to the previous charges brought by the state of New York for the 2022 stabbing attack, Matar has now been indicted by a grand jury on three counts, including attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. The Indian-born author, now a naturalized American, had faced death threats since his 1988 novel ""The Satanic Verses"" was declared blasphemous by Iran's supreme leader. In 1989, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a fatwa calling for Muslims to kill Rushdie. Hezbollah endorsed this fatwa, according to the FBI.The indictment alleges that from September 2020 until the attack, Matar sought to provide material support to Hezbollah by attempting to carry out the fatwa. He is also charged with engaging in an act of terrorism transcending national boundaries and providing material support to terrorists.","Hadi Matar, 26, charged with terrorism for allegedly acting on behalf of Hezbollah.

'Laffin Kamala' lights up Gen Z & social media,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/laffin-kamala-lights-up-gen-z-social-media/articleshow/112001197.cms,"WASHINGTON: Long geared towards attacking Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee for the 2024 prez elections, the Trump campaign is having to retool its ammunition against Kamala Harris . It's proving to be tough, with several duds having to be discarded. The age issue has gone out of the window now that Donald Trump is seen as the doddering old man. They've to be careful with the gender issue lest it upset female voters, who incidentally are greater in number than male voters in US.East Coast elite doesn't work because she is from California, and Trump himself is one - a Newyorker when he is not in New Jersey or Florida, milking Middle America's discontent. Nor is she a Washington insider or ""swamp creature"" that Trump pledged to defeat but couldn't in four years in the White House. That leaves personal attacks and racist dog whistles, and even that is not going well.Trump's efforts to disparage the vibrant laughter of ""laffin' Kamala"" as he calls her - some of his supporters dubbed her Kackala - has backfired spectacularly after her young supporters made celebratory mash-ups of her hearty laugh and dance moves set to music viral. One of the more popular memes showed a video cut of Harris laughing and dancing to British singer Charli XCX song from the album ""Brat"", a nightclub favorite that underscores the aspiration of Gen-Z (those in the age group of 12- 27), which sees the term as an embrace of authenticity and self-confidence, not a badly behaved child.The Harris campaign quickly co-opted the ""brat"" colour - the very specific shade of chartreuse or lime green - adding it to the coconut emoji that has already become part of the Kamala iconography. Kamala herself is aware of the Trump flock's effort to deride her hearty laughter, explaining in one interview that she has inherited it from her mother Shyamala. ""I grew up with a bunch of women who laughed from the belly. I'm never gonna be...tee hee hee"" she said, imitating a snicker.MAGA radicals efforts to stir up Kamala's relationship with former San Francisco mayor Willie Brown nearly 30 years ago has misfired, not that it was ever potent given Trump's own peccadilloes. Brown, who is now 90, wrote a short comment when she ran for prez in 2019 under the headline: Sure, I dated Kamala Harris. So what? ""It was more than 20 years ago. Yes, I may have influenced her career by appointing her to two state commissions when I was Assembly speaker. And I certainly helped with her first race for district attorney in San Francisco. I have also helped the careers of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Gov. Gavin Newsom, Sen. Dianne Feinstein and a host of other politicians,"" Brown said.Then came the clincher which elevated Kamala in the eyes of many: ""The difference is that Harris is the only one who, after I helped her, sent word that I would be indicted if I ""so much as jaywalked"" while she was DA"" Brown wrote, adding, ""That's politics for ya.""","The age issue has gone out of the window now that Donald Trump is seen as the doddering old man.

'Tough and capable' Kamala Harris

In a solemn address from the Oval Office on Thursday, President Joe Biden announced his decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race , marking the end of his political career. Framing the upcoming election as a critical juncture for the nation, Biden in his speech said that his choice was driven by a profound commitment to democracy .'Pass the torch ...“I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That is the best way to unite our nation,” Biden said. He made his decision after days of soul-searching and agonizing over internal polling that predicted he could lose against Republican Donald Trump in November and drag down fellow Democrats with him.“I revere this office, but I love my country more. It’s been the honor of my life to serve as your president. But in defense of democracy, which is at stake – and is more important than any title – I draw strength and I find joy in working for the American people,” Biden declared.Biden's speech began with a heartfelt expression of his love for America and the honor he felt in serving as its president. “This sacred task of perfecting our union – it’s not about me. It’s about you, your families, your future. It’s about we the people,” he said, emphasizing that the work of the nation transcends any individual leader.This address marked Biden’s first public appearance since the announcement of his decision not to seek reelection . He highlighted the importance of the upcoming election, portraying it as a choice between progress and regression, unity and division.""America’s going to have to choose between moving forward or backward, between hope and hate, between unity and division. We have to decide: Do we still believe in honesty, decency, respect? Freedom, justice and democracy?” Biden posed these questions to the nation, expressing confidence in the American people's inherent goodness and their ability to make the right choices.Biden reiterated his commitment to honesty and truth, qualities he vowed to uphold when he took office. “We are a great nation because we are good people. When you elected me to this office, I promised to always level with you, to tell you the truth. The truth, the sacred cause of this country, is larger than any one of us. We must unite to protect it,” he urged.Biden praised his Vice President Kamala Harris — the presumptive nominee for the Democratic presidential ticket — as ""tough"" and ""capable"" in his address to the nation from the Oval Office.""She's experienced, she's tough, she's capable. She's been an incredible partner to me and a leader for our country. Now, the choice is up to you, the American people,"" Biden said, just days after withdrawing from the election race and endorsing Harris.The speech was the president’s first public comments since passing the torch to Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic Party’s presumptive nominee . He did not dwell on the concerns about his age or health that caused him to relent to pressure from within his own party after a listless and halting debate performance.Instead, he pledged to continue working on foreign and domestic policy, seeking to advance his agenda even as a lame duck president for the next 180 days. He said of Harris that she is “experienced, she’s tough; she’s capable” and urged voters to pick her over former President Donald Trump.","Biden made his decision after days of soul-searching and agonizing over internal polling that predicted he could lose against Republican Donald Trump in November. “I revere this office, but I love my country more.

The decision to launch this protest comes a day after authorities raided the PTI central office in the capital and arrested its information secretary Raoof Hasan, followed by sealing off the office building.Pakistani authorities sealed the central office of Khan's party here over violation of safety standards.Islamabad's Metropolitan Corporation took action on Monday amidst rising legal challenges faced by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and its founder Khan.PTI chief Gohar Khan told journalists outside the Parliament that the hunger strike would be observed daily till 8 pm as a token protest to press for the release of 71-year-old former cricketer-turned-politician and reverse the injustice being done to the party.He said the protest conveyed the party's position against the ""injustice, unfairness, and the illegal and unconstitutional things that are happening [to us].""""The PTI founder (Khan) and his wife have been imprisoned for no reason.

Since then, he has been kept in jail in various cases.Gohar also said that the party's reservations regarding ""illegal and unconstitutional actions"" had been conveyed to National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq and the party decided to raise voice for the PTI lawmakers and their families who were being picked up.He also strongly condemned the sealing of the party's secretariat in the federal capital.Former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser said that the major demand was to set Khan and his wife free.""Our first demand is to release the PTI founder, his wife Bushra Bibi and other detainees, including Raoof Hasan and party workers,"" he said.He also demanded the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) led coalition government to immediately resign over ""bad governance and mismanaging the economy"".The strike came as authorities were gradually increasing pressure on the PTI, which continued to target the establishment and the government. Despite dozens of cases against Khan, he has refused to soften his tone and instead routinely criticise the Army leadership.PTI leaders have also kept up the pressure on the government by calling it illegal which allegedly came to power through fraudulent elections.","Pakistani authorities sealed the central office of Imran Khan's party here over violation of safety standards.

"Anti-terrorism efforts being made controversial by illegal, political mafias, says Pak army",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/anti-terrorism-efforts-being-made-controversial-by-illegal-political-mafias-says-pak-army/articleshow/111937180.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan armyaccused its criticsof “politicising” its anti-terrorism efforts , including a new military operation, to the detriment of the country’s national interests following the arrest on Monday of Raoof Hasan, information secretary of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), headed by jailed former prime minister Imran Khan. The army said the party information secretary was in charge of PTI ’s digital media cell which, it alleged, was involved in running anti-state propaganda.Last month PM Shehbaz Sharif had approved a military offensive to counter aspikein terrorist attacks across Pakistan, particularly in volatile northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and southwestern Balochistan provinces, but the idea was widely criticised by opposition parties, particularly PTI and the rights group Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM). They termed it a ploy against Pashtuns to earn dollars from major powers and exploit their resources.Addressing a presser in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, the military’s spokesperson, Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, asked, “Why did a mafia, a political mafia , and an illegal mafia say that they would not let this campaign (OperationAzm-e-Istehkam, or Resolve for Stability) happen?” He added that opponents of the offensive had tried to make it “controversial” and paint it as a purely military operation in which thousands of people would be displaced.He did not name any party or group butcalled the army’s critics “politicalandillegal mafias”,an apparent reference to PTI and PTM.Lt Gen Chaudhry said they were using “fake news and propaganda” to spread lies about the army and its intentions.“This is digital terrorism,” he said. “The physical terrorist also attacks law enforcement agencies and the army, and the digital terrorist also attacks the army. They are doing the same thing.”“Digital terrorists”, the spokesman said, would be deterred through laws, regulation and monitoring.He, however, questioned the lack of action against such individuals despite their activities against the leadership of the state and other institutions. “Instead of the courts and regulations moving forward against them, they’re given further space and they’re made heroes in the name of freedom of expression,” he said.Ahead of Sharif’s press conference, security forces had raided PTI’s offices and arrested Raoof Hasan from the party’s central secretariat. The raid came a week after the govt had said it planned to ban the party.“The PTI digital media centre had become a centre of international disinformation, from where anti-Pakistan propaganda is run throughout the world,” Islamabad police said, adding that those directly involved in anti-national propaganda were arrested and all evidence from PTI’s digital media cell wasconfiscated.The party issued a statement on X, saying: “It’s absolutely shameful how Islamabad police continues to completely mock and disregard every law in this country. Law of the jungle is reigning over Pakistan!”The crackdown on PTI follows several court rulings in its favour this month that threaten PM Sharif’s govt, which came to power in Feb this year with the military’s backing.","Pakistan army accuses its criticsof “politicising” its anti-terrorism efforts.

The Pakistan army on Monday accused an "" illegal political mafia "" of trying to sabotage its renewed military operation, codenamed "" Azm-i-Istehkam "" (Resolve for Stability), against rising terrorism in the country.Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) director general Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif, in a press conference in Rawalpindi, stated that a ""massive, illegal political mafia"" has risen to undermine the operation due to ""vested interests"".Sharif clarified that Azm-i-Istehkam is not just a military operation but a comprehensive counter-terrorism campaign launched through national consensus to reinvigorate the already in-place National Action Plan (NAP).He stressed that the purpose of the operation is to eliminate terrorism, which will eventually lead to ""societal and national uplift"".However, the DG ISPR accused a ""very strong lobby"" of having a vested interest in sabotaging the operation, as it does not want the NAP to succeed.He alleged that this entity is receiving a lot of money to subvert the operation.""The stakes in [sabotaging] this operation are very high, and it's not based on any ideology but involves a lot of money,"" he said.Lt Gen Sharif stated that the ""illegal political mafia"" made the first move to make the operations controversial through false and fake arguments.He pointed out that the problem lies in the implementation of the NAP's other points, such as the regularisation and registration of religious seminaries, where only a bit over 16,000 out of about 32,000 seminaries have been registered so far. He questioned whether the army should be responsible for these tasks.The DG ISPR also mentioned the issue of the ""illegal spectrum"", which hides a major illegal economy through which the criminal system and terrorism operate. He said the requirement of the illegal spectrum is a ""soft state"" and the solution to it is the National Action Plan.While the DG ISPR's statements highlight the challenges faced by the government in implementing its counter-terrorism strategy, it is essential to note that the army's involvement in political matters can be a sensitive issue.The military has historically played a significant role in the country's politics, and its direct intervention in political affairs has often been a subject of controversy.It remains to be seen whether the army will take a more active role in the country's affairs in response to the alleged sabotage of the counter-terrorism campaign by the ""illegal political mafia"".","Pakistan army accuses an ""illegal political mafia "" of trying to sabotage its renewed military operation.
