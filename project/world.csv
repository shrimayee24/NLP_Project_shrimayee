The Dargah Khwaja Saheb committee, a statutory body constituted by the minority affairs ministry, is the third respondent in the case.Advocate Yogesh Suroliya, one of Hindu Sena's three counsels, said the legal team submitted to the court a copy of former judicial officer and academician Har Bilas Sarda's 1911 book 'Ajmer: Historical and Descriptive', which purportedly mentions that remnants from a ""pre-existing"" Shiva temple at the site were used in building the dargah. ""We informed the court that there were continuous religious rituals at the temple till it was razed,"" fellow advocate Ram Swaroop Bishnoi said.Vijay Sharma, the third counsel, sought a survey by ASI of the premises to verify the petitioner's contention that the dome of the dargah contains ""pieces of the temple"" and that ""there is evidence of the presence of a sanctum sanctorum in the basement"".The lawsuit is similar to the Gyanvapi case , involving multiple Hindu plaintiffs who contend that the mosque in UP's Varanasi was built over the remains of a destroyed temple. ASI hasalready conducted a court-ordered survey there. The Krishna Janmabhoomi litigation in Mathura is another one, pertaining to a dispute over the ownership of the land where the Shahi Idgah now stands.In the Ajmer dargah case, Hindu Sena president Vishnu Gupta filed the petition in Sept but the initial hearing on the merit of the lawsuit was delayed because of a jurisdictional wrangle. The district and sessions judge then transferred the suit to the munsif court (west).The hearing was further delayed by the designated court asking for the petition in English to be translated into Hindi and submitted along with evidence and an affidavit.""The 38 pages of the lawsuit contain as many points of reference to show that aShiva temple pre-existed where the dargah is located,"" an advocate said. ""As in the Gyanvapi case, the Places of Worship Act, 1991, cannot be invoked to negate this suit.""Syed Sarwar Chishty, secretary of the Anjuman Moinia Fakhria, a body representing the dargah's hereditary caretakers, dismissed the Hindu side's arguments about the existence of a Shiva temple at the site of the Sufi shrine as baseless. ""These frivolous assertions are aimed at harming the country's communal harmony. The dargah is one of the most revered places for Muslims after Mecca and Medina. Such actions deeply hurt the sentiments of devotees worldwide,"" he said in a video-recorded statement.","A court in Rajasthan’s Ajmer issued notices Wednesday to the Union ministry of minority affairs and ASI on a lawsuit filed by a Hindu organisation laying claim to the site of the dargah of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti.

In our 'Cheetah State' Madhya Pradesh’s Kuno National Park, female cheetah Neerva has given birth to cubs. I extend my heartfelt congratulations and best wishes to all the forest workers involved in the conservation of the Cheetah Project.""Forest officials revealed that the cubs were found after a team monitoring Neerva’s movements detected that she had strayed away from her den. Upon inspection, the team found the mutilated remains of the cubs. “After checking all possible locations inside the boma, no further cubs were found,” the official stated. The cause of death remains unclear, as the carcasses of the cubs were sent for forensic analysis.Confusion had earlier surrounded the number of cubs Neerva had given birth to, as chief minister Yadav initially announced that four cubs had been born but later deleted the post, awaiting confirmation from the forest department.Neerva herself remains in good health, and all other adult cheetahs and 12 surviving cubs are reported to be in healthy condition. The investigation into the cubs' deaths is ongoing, with the forest department waiting for lab results to determine the exact cause of their demise.The birth of the cubs marked a significant moment in India's Cheetah Reintroduction Project, which began in 2022. Cheetahs, once extinct in India, were brought from Namibia and South Africa under the project. Despite facing challenges, including the deaths of eight adult cheetahs, the project has seen breeding success, with 17 cubs born and 12 surviving.

BENGALURU: Sandalwood actor Darshan , while seeking bail in the Renukaswamy murder case, told the high court that the deceased had been a ""menace to orderly society"" as he sent several vulgar messages and pornographic content to women.Representing Darshan , senior advocate CV Nagesh said in court: ""He (Renukaswamy), who had no respect for women, indulged in sending pornographic content, nude photos to several women, thus outraging their modesty. Messages were sent in the name of Gautam. He was a menace to orderly society. Such messages were sent not only to accused no. 1 (Pavithra Gowda) but to several other women.""Renukaswamy's body was found near a drain in Kamakshipalya, west Bengaluru, on June 9. Two days later, Darshan along with friend Pavithra and other aides were arrested on charges of murdering Renukaswamy.Nagesh, while elaborating on how the actor's image had been portrayed following the arrest, stated: ""A man (Renukaswamy) who has no regard for women and doesn't want to respect them, who is a lawless person … has been glorified, made a national hero in the case while his (Darshan's) status has been degraded, though in real life he is a reel hero.""Justice S Vishwajith Shetty, who heard the bail pleas for more than two hours on Tuesday, directed the matter to be posted on Nov 28.The hearing saw Darshan's advocate highlighting alleged loopholes in police investigation, which included unexplained delays in conducting inquest proceedings and autopsy along with discrepancies in the prosecution's claims pertaining to kidnap of Renukaswamy, destruction of evidence following the murder, and seizure of proof from the actor's residence.Reading out Renukaswamy's father Kashinathaiah's statement, Nagesh claimed there is no evidence that he was kidnapped either by force or deceit from Chitradurga to Bengaluru. Even Renukaswamy's mother had said he had gone for lunch with friends. During the journey to Bengaluru, Renukaswamy paid the bill at a restaurant, Nagesh said, adding: ""Will a kidnapped person pay a bill of Rs 640?""Referring to invoking Indian Penal Code Section 201, Nagesh cited a Supreme Court judgment to contend that shifting of a body from one place to another doesn't remotely indicate it as a case of destruction of evidence of a crime.

The agreement is said to outline a 60-day ceasefire, during which Israeli forces would pull back to their side of the border, and Hezbollah would cease its military presence across much of southern Lebanon.

The deal got into effect from Wednesday (local time).

The agreement stipulates the deployment of thousands of Lebanese soldiers and UN peacekeepers to the area south of the Litani River.

An international monitoring group, headed by the US, will oversee compliance from all parties. President Biden stated that the deal aims to achieve a lasting end to hostilities.

Israel has insisted on the right to take action if Hezbollah breaches its commitments, a provision that Lebanese officials have opposed including in the agreement.

How US and UK view the deal?



What Hezbollah said about the deal?



What does the deal say on Gaza?



Israel has agreed to a US-brokered ceasefire deal with Lebanon's Hezbollah which got into effect from early Wednesday (Israel time). Hezbollah leaders also indicated preliminary support for the agreement, which presents a potential exit strategy for both parties from the ongoing conflict.The agreement calls for a 60-day ceasefire, with Israeli troops retreating and Hezbollah withdrawing from southern Lebanon.Meanwhile, Israel has insisted on the right to act if Hezbollah violates the deal, Lebanon has opposed this provision.The conflict between the two has displaced over 1.2 million Lebanese and 50,000 Israelis. Meanwhile, Israel's heavy bombing campaign has resulted in more than 3,700 deaths, mostly civilians, according to Lebanese officials, while over 130 have been killed on the Israeli side.US President and UK PM have both hailed the ceasefire deal with Joe Biden calling it a ""good news"" and Keir Starmer highlighting it that it was ""long overdue.""""I just spoke with the prime ministers of Israel and Lebanon and I'm pleased to announce that their governments have accepted the United States' proposal to end the devastating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah,"" Biden said.""We must see immediate progress towards a ceasefire deal in Gaza, the release of all hostages and the removal of restrictions on desperately needed humanitarian aid,"" Starmer said in a statement.A Hezbollah leader said that the group's support for the deal depends on assurances that Israel will not resume its attacks.“After reviewing the agreement signed by the enemy government, we will see if there is a match between what we stated and what was agreed upon by the Lebanese officials,” Mahmoud Qamati, deputy chair of Hezbollah’s political council, told Al Jazeera.“We want an end to the aggression, of course, but not at the expense of the sovereignty of the state” of Lebanon, he added.The agreement does little to address the deadly conflict in Gaza. The war, which began after the Hamas attack on southern Israel in October 2023 that killed 1,200 people, continues to rage on without a direct resolution from the agreement.Hezbollah has previously maintained that it would only cease its attacks on Israel if Israel stopped its military actions in Gaza. Some in the region may see any agreement between the Lebanese group and Israel as a form of surrender.",Israel and Hezbollah have agreed to a 60-day ceasefire. Israeli forces would pull back to their side of the border. Hezbollah would cease its military presence across much of southern Lebanon. Israel has insisted on the right to take action if Hezbollah breaches the deal.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115714732,imgsize-919986,width-400,resizemode-4/115714732.jpg"
Drunk Ahmedabad bizman rams Audi into 6 cars; smokes cigarette after crash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/ahmedabad-audi-crash-drunk-bizman-rams-car-into-6-vehicles-granted-bail-with-strict-conditions/articleshow/115753473.cms,"CCTV footage from the spot showed the inebriated suspect casually smoking a cigarette before slumping on the road

Panchal was caught for drunk driving in Sep

Two cops suspended; inquiry against PI, PSO

Granted bail with strict conditions

AHMEDABAD: A businessman from Thaltej, 41, crashed his high-end car into six vehicles on Bopal-Ambli Road on Monday morning, injuring one person while five others narrowly escaped death. The accused, Ripal Panchal , a resident of Tulip Bungalows in Thaltej, was drunk at the time of the accident, said police.CCTV footage from the spot showed Panchal casually smoking a cigarette before lying down to sleep on the road in an inebriated state. This is not his first offence — on Sep 16, Panchal was caught by Bodakdev police for drunk driving.According to an FIR filed with M Division traffic police by Ashish Gupta, a chartered accountant from Shela, “I was heading to a car service centre in Ambli around 9am when this driver crashed into my car near Ambli village gate,” Gupta stated in his complaint.“He did not stop there. He went on to hit a motorcycle, a scooter, two more cars, and a loading rickshaw before finally crashing into a BRTS railing, causing damage to more vehicles.”A woman scooterist sustained leg injuries in the crash. When onlookers gathered at the scene, Panchal emerged from his vehicle but was unable to maintain his balance as he was drunk.According to police sources, Panchal, who operates a stainless-steel ball valve manufacturing unit at Santej in Gandhinagar, lives with his mother in Tulip Bungalows. The case was initiated after Gupta contacted the police control room, prompting M Division Traffic Police to investigate the matter.M Division Traffic Police registered a complaint of rash driving, causing damage to property, and acts endangering the lives of others under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita and pressed charges under Motor Vehicles Act, Prohibition Act and Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act against Panchal. Notably, despite a woman suffering leg injuries in the accident, city traffic police did not include charges of causing hurt in their complaint.In Sep 16, Bodakdev cops had caught Panchal near a private hospital in Sola for allegedly driving under the influence of alcohol. According to a complaint filed by Khemraj Gadhvi, constable with Bodakdev police, he and other cops were patrolling at Sola when they saw a man driving his car recklessly. He was headed from Hebatpur to Sola.They intercepted the vehicle and got the driver, Ripal Panchal, to undergo a field sobriety test. He was found to be drunk. According to the FIR, his car, valued at Rs 5 lakh, was seized, and he was charged with drunk driving under the Motor Vehicles Act. Despite having a case registered against him, he continued to drive under the influence of alcohol. Over the past two months, city police have been conducting traffic drives at key intersections, but these measures failed to prevent Panchal from driving drunk.After a Thaltej-based businessman, Ripal Panchal, rammed his car into six vehicles on Monday, the city traffic police suspended two constables and began an inquiry against a PSO and an in charge police inspector for negligence in duty. According to a statement from the city traffic police, head constable Sirajuddin Yunus Khan and constable Pruthviraj Bharatsinh were suspended.The PSO of M Division Traffic Police, assistant sub-inspector Ratilal Mohanlal, showed negligence in calling FSL to the crime scene. He and in charge inspector PM Marwada will face an inquiry, said the statement.A magisterial court on Tuesday granted bail to Ripal Panchal. While granting Panchal bail on a Rs 15,000 self-bond, additional chief judicial magistrate D M Bavishi restrained him from driving any vehicle until a chargesheet was filed against him.While imposing various conditions on Panchal, the court said, ""Considering the power vested in the court under the BNS 2023 provisions regarding community service, the accused is hereby ordered not to drive any vehicle until the filing of the chargesheet.""When Panchal was produced before the court by M Division Traffic Police, he filed a bail application. His lawyer submitted that Panchal was a local resident and there was no chance of him fleeing the trial. Moreover, the charges against him were triable by a judicial magistrate first class (JMFC).An assistant public prosecutor opposed the bail by citing Panchal's behaviour, noting that he was caught driving in an inebriated condition in Sep. This was the second such incident involving Panchal in a span of three months. He put people's lives in danger and created panic due to rash and negligent driving, and was found drunk as well, it was submitted.","Ripal Panchal, 41, crashed his high-end car into six vehicles on Bopal-Ambli Road on Monday morning, injuring one person while five others narrowly escaped death.

Israel announced on Wednesday that it will appeal the arrest warrants issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant.The country also requested that the ICC suspend the warrants until the appeal is resolved, according to a statement from Netanyahu's office.The ICC issued the warrants last week, citing suspicions of crimes against humanity and war crimes related to Israel’s military actions in Gaza following Hamas’s attack on October 7, 2023.Netanyahu and other Israeli officials criticized the warrants, with the prime minister accusing the ICC of bias and saying, ""The State of Israel challenges the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the legitimacy of the arrest warrants issued."" ""Israel's notice of appeal reveals in detail how the decision to issue the arrest warrants was baseless and devoid of any factual or legal basis,"" the statement further said.The statement added that a rejection of the appeal would highlight what he described as the ICC’s bias against Israel.""If the court rejects this request, it will further demonstrate to Israel's friends in the United States and around the world how biased the International Criminal Court is against the State of Israel,"" it said.The ICC has not commented directly on the appeal.

The FBI confirmed Wednesday that multiple members of Donald Trump 's incoming administration have been targeted with bomb threats and swatting incidents , heightening security concerns as the former president prepares to assume his position in January.

'

Broader context of

transgender rights debate

Ohio governor Mike DeWine signed the “Protect All Students Act” on Wednesday, prohibiting transgender students from using school bathrooms, locker rooms, or overnight accommodations aligning with their gender identity. Dubbed the ""bathroom bill,"" the law applies to public and private schools and colleges, taking effect in 90 days.The legislation mandates that facilities be designated exclusively for males and females based on biological sex assigned at birth. While it lacks enforcement mechanisms, it exempts school staff, emergencies, and caregivers assisting young children or those with disabilities.The bill’s sponsor, Republican State Senator Jerry Cirino , defended it as essential for privacy and safety, stating: “It revolves around safety, security, and, I think, common sense. It protects our children and grandchildren in private spaces where they are most vulnerable.” Aaron Baer, president of the Center for Christian Virtue, praised the law, saying, “Common sense is on a winning streak in America today. No student should be forced to go into the bathroom or locker room with a student of the opposite sex.”Opposition to the law has been swift and strong. The American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio labeled it an “anti-trans bathroom bill,” arguing it compromises transgender students' safety. Jocelyn Rosnick, the ACLU's policy director, called it a “cruel invasion of students’ rights to privacy.” Equality Ohio 's executive director, Dwayne Steward, criticized the measure, warning it puts vulnerable youth at greater risk. Both groups pledged to continue advocating for transgender students' rights.Ohio joins 11 other states that have enacted similar bathroom restrictions, with 26 states restricting or banning gender-affirming care for minors. Earlier this year, Ohio passed laws limiting gender-affirming care and barring transgender athletes in women’s sports.The national debate over transgender rights intensified during Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, which included promises to restrict transgender participation in women’s sports and limit gender-affirming healthcare. With Trump’s election win, Republican lawmakers plan to push similar measures in state legislatures convening in early 2025.While proponents argue these laws protect privacy and safety, critics say they unfairly target marginalized communities. Legal challenges loom, as the US supreme court prepares to review Tennessee’s ban on gender-affirming care, a decision that could affect similar laws nationwide.","Ohio governor Mike DeWine signed the “Protect All Students Act’ on Wednesday.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo , however, responded to Trump's claim and said that Mexico's strategy is not to close borders but to build bridges between governments and people.After a telephonic exchange with Pardo, Trump said, ""Just had a wonderful conversation with the new President of Mexico, Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo.""“She has agreed to stop Migration through Mexico, and into the United States, effectively closing our Southern Border,” he added.Pardo, however, did not immediately respond to Trump's remarks and shared brief details of a discussion about migration ""strategy.""""We discussed Mexico's strategy on the migration phenomenon and I shared that caravans are not arriving at the northern border because they are being taken care of in Mexico,"" Sheinbaum said on X.Trump said that he and Sheinbaum Pardo also discussed illegal drugs coming into the US from south of the border during their “very productive conversation.”“We also talked about what can be done to stop the massive drug inflow into the United States, and also, U.S. consumption of these drugs,” he wrote.“It was a very productive conversation!” he added.This comes days after Trump said that he would impose tariffs of 25 percent on Mexican and Canadian imports and 10 percent on goods from China.""This Tariff will remain in effect until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!"" Trump wrote on his Truth Social page.Meanwhile, Mexican economy minister Marcelo Ebrard said that almost ""400,000 jobs will be lost"" in the United States if Trump followed through on his threat. He cited a study based on figures from US carmakers that manufacture in Mexico.Ebrard said the tariffs would also hit US consumers hard, citing the US market for pickup trucks, most of which are manufactured in Mexico. The minister said that the tariffs would add $3,000 to the cost of a new vehicle.""The impact of this measure will chiefly be felt by consumers in the United States... That is why we say that it would be a shot in the foot,"" Ebrard told reporters, speaking alongside Sheinbaum at her regular morning conference.Illegal migration was one of the top issues in the recently concluded US presidential elections.Trump vowed to enact the largest deportation in history, starting when he takes the oath of office January 20.Earlier this month, the president-elect confirmed that he would declare a “national emergency” to deport illegal migrants with the help of “military assets” once he steps back into office.","US President-elect Donald Trump announced that Mexico has agreed to ""stop"" migration, effectively closing the US southern border.

Kim Kardashian who is close to Ivanka Trump and was seen speaking with Elon Musk on several occasions dropping enough hints for people to conclude that she has gone MAGA said she did not take money from Tesla to pose with its futuristic robot. Kardashian posted a series of photographs of herself on Instagram and X posing in front of and inside a Tesla Cybercab with an Optimus robot in the driver's seat.A representative for Kardashian told the New York Times that no payments were received in exchange for the posts.Kardashian's connection with the Trumps is not new and the first photo of Ivanka Trump with Kardhasian emerged in 2023 when Kardashian held a birthday celebration at Funke, an Italian restaurant in Beverly Hills, California. The group photograph that Kardashian posted included Lauren Sánchez, the partner of Jeff Bezos, and Ivanka Trump.Ivanka is not in her father's inner circle any more Kardashian still has strong footholds in the MAGA territory. But why would she post with Tesla futuristic products if she was not advertising for them and if she has received no money from Tesla?The NYT report said the Trump family has aided her on that front in the past and will soon be back in power politically and hence her coziness with the Trumps will remain intact. In 2018, Kardashian, whose father was a prominent attorney and businessman, became involved in an effort to help free Alice Marie Johnson, who was sentenced to life in prison for her involvement in a 1996 cocaine smuggling operation. Kardashian met Donald Trump at the White House where she told him Johnson's story.In 2020, Kim let Trump down after she decided to not endorse any presidential candidate. “I was disappointed in Kim,” Donald Trump said in an interview. “With Kim, I did a lot of prison reform that she couldn’t get done with anybody else.” “I let people out of prison that I thought were deserving to be let out,” he added. “And then after it was all over, she announced that she’s not supporting me. And she only did that to be cool in Hollywood.”In this election too, Kardashian did not endorse any candidate and kept silent after Donald Trump's win.

Kamala Harris News: Kamala Harris adviser's explosive claim: Internal polling never showed VP leading Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-harris-advisers-explosive-claim-internal-polling-never-showed-vp-leading-trump/articleshow/115742482.cms,"Kamala Harris's campaign adviser claims internal polling never showed the VP leading Trump.

Did David Plouffe delete his X account to avoid questions?



Kamala Harris' senior campaign adviser David Plouffe made an explosive claim that the party's internal polling never showed that the VP was ahead of Donald Trump in September and October. In fact, the internal polling showed her way behind, Plouffe said on Pod Save America podcast. It was the external polling that kept Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump marginally.“We were behind. I mean, I think it surprised people because there were these public polls that came out in late September, early October, showing us with leads that we never saw,” Plouffe said in his first interview since the election loss. The campaign said they just had short time for the campaigning indirectly putting the blame on President Joe Biden.Plouffe said the campaign faced difficulties to find out how to distance Harris from Joe Biden since they were part of the same administration.“Imagine if we said, ‘Well, we would have taken this approach on the border.’ Imagine the round of stories coming out after that of people saying, ‘Well, she never said that in a meeting,’ or ‘What meeting when she said this,’ or ‘I remember when she did that.’ And it was just, it wasn’t going to give us what we needed because it wouldn’t be a clean break.”“It’s always worth reminding people: It’s really hard for Democrats to win battleground states, OK? Let’s look at Pennsylvania: 25 per cent of the electorate is liberal, roughly, 34 per cent is conservative,” Plouffe said. “So in every battleground state, there’s more conservatives than liberals.”“In Pennsylvania, if exits are to be believed, Trump won conservatives 91-8. Harris won Liberals 93–6. Moderates, Harris won 56-43. But you kind of got to win 60 percent of them, right?” Plouffe said. “So, you know, for Democrats to win battleground states, to Quentin and Jen’s point, it is a false choice.”“And I think as we look ahead to ’26 and ’28, particularly where you have seen drift amongst noncollege voters generally, particularly those of color, specifically, you know, we obviously have to get some of that back. We can’t afford any more erosion. The math just doesn’t f‑‑‑ing work, okay?”“But, I don’t think this is a permanent realignment, but the point here is to win battleground states. Yes, of course you have to maximize your turnout and your vote share amongst liberal voters if you’re a Democrat,” he added. “That was a huge focus. You’ve got to win the center.”As the interview came, a viral post claimed that David Plouffe initially deleted his X account so that he didn't have to answer public questions because he was peddling fake data to get funds. ""David Plouffe initially deleted his 𝕏 account, likely so he didn't have to answer public questions about the FAKE data he was peddling to media in the final week, which unsurprisingly, they didn't even bother to confirm, but then the account reappears and now he is admitting on a podcast that not a single poll was legit and that their internal polling NEVER had Harris in the lead, ever and they were forced to lied to donors. It was all a giant scam.

(Reuters)

ISLAMABAD: At least eight supporters of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) were killed and dozens of others injured in Islamabad following what the party said was a sweeping crackdown overnight by security forces to disperse protesters demanding the release of jailed former prime minister and PTI chief Imran Khan Following the crackdown, Imran’s party ended its agitation but Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur addressed a press conference in his province on Wednesday saying the protest would go on. “Until Imran Khan’s call, this sit-in will go on,” he said without elaborating where it would be held. PTI has been in govt in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.Thousands of demonstrators, led by Imran’s wife Bushra Bibi, and Gandapur, had gathered in the capital on Tuesday vowing to stage a sit-in until their demands were met, including the release of political prisoners. Khan and many other PTI leaders and workers have been in jail for over a year on charges that they claim are politically motivated.Security forces launched a massive crackdown before midnight Tuesday after failing to stop protesters from marching to D-Chowk, a public square in Islamabad’s high-security red zone. In the evening authorities forced surrounding stores, cafes and markets to shut and then plunged the protest venue into darkness by switching off streetlights. Eyewitnesses said indiscriminate firing and teargas shelling, which started after 11pm and continued for about two hours, forced the PTI supporters, mostly Pashtuns from the northwest, to retreat.PTI claimed eight of its supporters had died in the late-night clashes and “hundreds” more were feared to have been killed. The govt stated three paramilitary troops and one policeman had died since the PTI launched its protest on Sunday. Islamabad’s police chief told media more than 900 people had been arrested in Tuesday’s raid, in which there were dozens of Afghan nationals.Sources at Islamabad’s two public hospitals said five civilians had died of gunshot wounds and dozens had been injured. According to PTI workers, they had picked up three bodies from the protest site.Information minister Attaullah Tarar said the protesters had fled in disarray, leaving behind vehicles, and even their shoes and clothes.PTI said in a post on social media that a “massacre has unfolded in Pakistan at the hands of security forces”. It accused the armed security forces of launching a violent assault on peaceful PTI protesters, firing live rounds with the intent to kill as many people as possible. It went on to compare last night’s clashes to the violence in the then East Pakistan in 1971. “The rulers have learned nothing from history and are prepared to destroy the country to cling to their illegitimate power,” the post stated. “With hundreds dead and countless injured, the interior minister’s threat to kill, and then the declaration of ‘victory’ over slaughtered innocents is enough evidence of the regime’s inhumanity,” it added.On Wednesday morning, the heavily fortified red zone was empty of protesters but dozens of smashed vehicles, including the charred remains of a truck from which Imran’s wife had been leading the protest, portrayed a grim picture.",At least eight supporters of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) were killed and dozens of others injured in Islamabad.

Bushra Bibi , the wife of former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan , is leading protests demanding his release from jail. At least five people have died in the resulting violence.Khan supporters, led by Bushra Bibi, marched in various locations, including D-Chowk in Islamabad. A planned rally on November 24 was prevented by an Islamabad High Court order citing the visit of Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko and a new public order law. Protests also occurred globally.Speaking to PTI workers, Bibi said, ""This is not just about my husband; it is about this country and its leader."" Addressing a rally, she added, ""Until Imran Khan is with us, we will not end this protest. I will remain here until my last breath, and I ask all of you to stand by us. This isn’t just about my husband. It’s about the future of our country and the leadership we deserve.""Khan was ousted in a no-trust motion in 2022 and has been imprisoned since. Bushra and Khan are now facing terrorism charges related to the November 24 protest. Bushra, who typically wears traditional Islamic attire covering her face, has become more politically active since Khan's imprisonment.Bushra Bibi, the wife of former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, is facing several legal challenges, including a corruption case and a complaint filed by her ex-husband.Bibi, who married Khan in 2018, was recently released on bail after serving part of a 14-year sentence. She alleged attempts to poison her food while incarcerated. She and Khan were jailed and fined $2 million each in a corruption case related to state gifts. Khan and Bibi face approximately 200 legal cases following his removal from office.Bibi’s ex-husband, Khawar Maneka, is pursuing a case against her related to their divorce. Maneka, the son of a former minister, alleges a “fraudulent marriage.” His “fornication” claim was rejected. The case centers on whether Bibi observed the required waiting period before remarrying under Islamic law. Bibi and Maneka were married for 28 years and have five children.Bibi, approximately 50 years old, is known as a spiritual guide and faith healer. Khan has described her as a spiritual guide. Prior to marrying Khan, Bibi was married to Maneka and was known as Bushra Maneka. She is a follower of Sufism and a devotee of the Sufi mystic poet Baba Farid.Khan stated in 2018 that he did not see Bibi’s face until after their marriage. “In a rare, and till then the only TV interview in October 2018, she dismissed this as bunkum,” regarrumors that she had foreseen Khan’s prime ministership in a dream.","Imran Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi, is leading protests demanding his release from jail.

Pakistan's security forces conducted a midnight raid on supporters of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan after they stormed Islamabad, demanding his release. As per media reports, hundreds of people were arrested in the operation.""Today, armed security forces launched a violent assault on peaceful PTI protesters in Islamabad, firing live rounds with the intent to kill as many people as possible,"" Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf said in a post on X.Earlier, thousands of protesters, led by a convoy headed by Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi, gathered in central Islamabad and breached several security barriers near the city's heavily fortified red zone. The red zone area houses important government buildings, including Pakistan's parliament and foreign missions. The protests turned violent, resulting in the deaths of six people, including four paramilitary soldiers.A raid was launched by security forces on Tuesday night to disperse the protesters. Security forces used tear gas to disperse protesters, and local media reported that lights in the area had been turned off during the operation.Imran Khan's party, PTI, said that the protesters had planned to stage a sit-in in the red zone until Khan’s release. The former prime minister has been in jail since August 2023. Pakistan interior minister Mohsin Naqvi rejected any possibility of negotiations with the protesters, accusing them of being armed and violating a ban on gatherings.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif blamed the protesters for the deaths of the soldiers, accusing them of using vehicles to attack paramilitary troops. PTI spokesperson Zulfikar Bukhari denied these claims, however, saying that two protesters had also died and 30 were injured during the clashes. Bukhari alleged that one protester was shot dead while another was run over by a vehicle.Sharif, in a statement, described the protest as an act of extremism aimed at achieving political goals. He also said that law enforcement agencies were reaching their ""limits of restraint"" in handling the violence.Earlier, Khan, 72, in a post on X from jail, urged his supporters to continue their struggle, saying, ""My message for my team is to fight until the last ball is bowled. We will not back down until our demands are met.""The violence escalated after a march led by Khan’s wife and key aide Ali Amin Gandapur reached Islamabad on Tuesday. Khan’s wife fled as police pushed back against demonstrators.The protest, described by Khan as the ""final call,"" follows a series of demonstrations held by PTI since his imprisonment. Pakistan authorities noted that this protest was larger and more violent than previous ones, with participants reportedly armed with tear gas launchers, steel rods, and other objects.PTI has also called for the reversal of constitutional amendments that it claims undermine the judiciary, which has questioned some of the cases against Khan.Imran Khan, who was removed from power by parliament in 2022 after losing the support of the military, faces multiple charges, including corruption and incitement to violence, which he denies. Khan’s party had performed well in February elections but claimed the polls were rigged by a military-backed crackdown. The military has denied these allegations.","Security forces conducted a midnight raid on supporters of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan after they stormed Islamabad.

Input from Omer Farooq Khan

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan deployed its army within the nation's capital on Tuesday with orders to shoot protesters if necessary, as deadly clashes escalated between the police and supporters of former PM Imran Khan.The govt said four paramilitary rangers and two policemen were killed late Monday and over 100 security personnel injured in the violence, as thousands of protesters marched to Islamabad to demand Khan's release from prison. PM Shehbaz Sharif blamed the protesters for the soldiers' deaths, accusing them of ramming the paramilitary troops with a convoy of vehicles. ""It is not a peaceful protest. It is extremism,"" he said in a statement, aimed at achieving ""evil political designs"".Zulfikar Bukhari, spokesman for Khan's party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), denied Sharif's accusation and claimed that two protesters had been killed and 30 more injured in the clashes, the worst political violence seen in months in the nation of 241 million people. One of the protesters was shot dead and the other was run over by a vehicle, Bukhari said. Authorities did not reply to a query seeking to confirm the deaths.Meanwhile, Amnesty International said the govt must fully protect the rights of protesters and rescind ""shoot-on-sight"" orders that it said gave undue and excessive powers to military.Khan's supporters dismantled roadblocks that had been put in place to stop them while patriotic songs blared from vehicles. Some danced in front of the slow-moving convoy, some chanting, ""Revolution! Revolution!"" When they reached the square late afternoon, some chanted ""Prisoner Number 804"" - a reference to Khan - while others climbed atop shipping containers that had been set up to block their advance.PTI workers, many of them brandishing slingshots and sticks, engaged security personnel in combat as they attempted to make way to D-Chowk, a central square in front of parliament located close to key govt buildings such as the presidency, the PM office, and the supreme court. The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.Khan called for the demonstration over the weekend. Pakistan's military-backed civilian govt put the capital on lockdown, blocking major highways and suspending cellular and internet services in several areas. But protesters managed to enter the city Monday night.Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi, was leading the protest with Ali Amin Gandapur, CM of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province where PTI is in govt, accompanying her. Upon reaching Islamabad, Bibi vowed from atop a container truck: ""I promise that I will be the last woman here, I will not leave D-Chowk without him (Imran). You also promise me that you will not leave until Khan comes out. If anyone tells you otherwise, it is a lie.""In a post on X from jail, Khan, 72, said. ""To my team, my message is clear: Fight till the last ball... This is the struggle for Pakistan's survival and true freedom"". Khan also issued a call for more supporters to join protests in the capital. Khan accuses the govt and the military of conspiring to crush his party and undermine democracy. He has also criticised recent legal changes that limit the power of judiciary, arguing that they are meant to keep him out of power.Interior minister Mohsin Naqvi, speaking to journalists, ruled out any negotiations with the protesters. He also claimed that the protesters, who had gathered at D-Chowk, had been pushed back and the area was cleared. The turmoil, meanwhile, has rattled investors.

ISLAMABAD: Thousands of protesters demanding the release of former prime minister Imran Khan arrived at the heart of Pakistan’s heavily fortified capital, Islamabad, on Tuesday amid intense teargas shelling and use of rubber bullets by security forces, even as the govt invoked Article 245 of the constitution, which allows a civilian govt to call in the army to help it implement law and order.At least four security personnel and two civilians were killed in overnight clashes between security forces and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) supporters. Interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said three Rangers (paramilitary force) personnel and one police constable were killed by miscreants. The Imran-Khan-led PTI denied the allegations, saying security officials were crushed by police and Rangers’ vehicles speeding away from protesters.“Under Article 245, the Pakistan army has been called in, and orders have been issued to deal with the miscreants with an iron hand,” the state-run Radio Pakistan reported. “Clear orders have also been issued to shoot miscreants and troublemakers on sight,” it added.On Tuesday, PTI workers, many of them brandishing slingshots and sticks, engaged security personnel in combat as they attempted to make their way to D-Chowk (Democracy Chowk), a central square in front of parliament.Imran’s wife, Bushra Bibi, was leading the protest with Ali Amin Gandapur, CM of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province where PTI is in govt, accompanying her.

Khan’s wife was leading the main convoy from the party’s stronghold of Peshawar. Islamabad has been in security lockdown since Sunday, with authorities closing all schools in the capital and the adjacent garrison city of Rawalpindi. Mobile and internet services have also been partially suspended in the twin cities.All roads and highways from nearby cities to the federal capital, as well as all routes that connect Islamabad and Rawalpindi, have been shut since last weekend.The PTI has been protesting for the release of political prisoners, including Khan. Its second demand is the reversal of the 26th Constitutional Amendment passed by parliament in Oct. The legislation has radically altered the judiciary by setting a fixed term of three years for the Supreme Court’s chief justice, who will now be selected by a parliamentary committee. It has also weakened the powers of the apex court, with constitutional cases and those involving fundamental rights to be heard by constitutional benches that will be constituted by panels dominated by govt representatives. The PTI’s last demand is for the return of its allegedly stolen Feb 8 general election mandate.","At least four security personnel and two civilians were killed in overnight clashes between security forces and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) supporters.

PTI demands the resignation of Sharif’s government and the revocation of alleged unconstitutional amendments undermining democratic freedoms.

The PTI’s sit-in aims to replicate Khan's iconic 2014 demonstrations, which paralysed Islamabad for 126 days. This time, participants include top PTI leaders and Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi.

Sharif has condemned the violence, calling PTI an ""anarchist group"" responsible for chaos. Over 4,000 PTI supporters have been arrested, and shoot-at-sight orders have reportedly been issued to deter further violence.

What did the US say?

Govt tightens restrictions

Islamabad has become the centre of escalating unrest as thousands of supporters of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan marched into Pakistan's capital, clashing violently with security forces. The protests, driven by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, have led to six deaths, including four security personnel, and prompted the deployment of the Pakistan Army under Article 245 of the Constitution, with shoot-on-sight orders being issued, ARY news reported.Security forces have struggled to contain the protesters, who broke through barricades and flooded the Red Zone—a fortified area housing key government buildings. The demonstrations turned deadly when a vehicle in the convoy rammed into security personnel, killing four Rangers.To manage the situation, Islamabad's roads have been blocked with shipping containers, schools remain shut, and mobile internet services have been suspended. Tear gas and warning shots have been used to disperse crowds, but the PTI has vowed to press on until Khan is released. PTI leader Bushra Bibi has urged demonstrators to remain peaceful but resolute, saying, “The march will not end until Imran Khan is free.”The unrest stems from PTI’s demand for the immediate release of Imran Khan, who has been in prison since August 2023, convicted in multiple graft cases. PTI supporters argue the charges are politically motivated and claim the current government, led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who they allege came to power through rigged elections.The United States has expressed concern over the deteriorating situation in Pakistan, urging restraint from all sides. US State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller stated, “We call on protesters to demonstrate peacefully and refrain from violence, and at the same time, we call on Pakistani authorities to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms.”The government has tightened restrictions, banning gatherings and limiting travel between cities. Travel between Islamabad and other cities has become nearly impossible due to shipping containers blocking roads, and all educational institutions have been closed. Mobile internet services and messaging platforms are experiencing significant disruptions in the capital.Police have arrested over 4,000 supporters of Khan since Friday and suspended mobile and internet services in certain areas of the country. On Thursday, a court issued a ban on rallies in the capital, with Naqvi stating that anyone who defied the order would be arrested.","Protests led by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party have led to six deaths, including four security personnel.
