Attack on former Punjab deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal shows rise of radical fringe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/attack-on-former-punjab-dy-cm-sukhbir-singh-badal-shows-rise-of-radical-fringe/articleshow/115985062.cms,"NEW DELHI/AMRITSAR: Shiromani Akali Dal chief and former Punjab deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal narrowly escaped assassination while undergoing religious punishment outside Golden Temple on Wednesday when an alert plainclothes cop lunged and pushed pro-Khalistan hardliner Narain Singh Chaura 's gun hand upward, causing the shot to go wide. The shooter had come within a few feet of Badal.The timely intervention of ASI Jasbir Singh in Sukhbir's security detail, and a sewadar (volunteer) who helped overpower the gunman, averted a tragedy. The attack, which occurred around 9.30am, was filmed by reporters covering Day 2 of Sukhbir's penance.Police said Sukhbir was unhurt. Clad in a blue sewadar uniform, the SAD president was sitting at the Golden Temple entrance at the time and had a placard around his neck as part of the ""tankhah"" religious punishment pronounced by the Akal Takht for religious misconduct during his father Parkash Singh Badal's tenure as CM from 2007 to 2017.It was the ubiquitous 'Sikh moderates vs radicals' tug-of-war on display as history-sheeter and highly-radicalised pro-Khalistan terrorist Narain Singh Chaura aimed his weapon at former Punjab deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal, scion of the 'moderate' Badal family.According to an ex-IPS officer from Punjab, the sensational assassination attempt by a terrorist who has been involved in serious offences like murder, attempt to murder, possession of arms and explosives and militancy in the past, and was in constant touch with the leadership of Sikh terrorists outfits based in Pakistan, was the manifestation of the discontent and religious extremism simmering in Punjab for almost two decades.Particularly between 2007 and 2017, when the 'moderate' Badals were in office, the 'radical fringe' voices in the Sikh diaspora grew shriller, using social media as a vehicle to influence and indoctrinate new generation that has no living memory of how their families had suffered at the height of Sikh terror and who only seem to have seen the romanticised, pro-Khalistan propaganda fed to them online.""The 'radical extremism' sentiment seems to have only gained momentum in the wake of the farmers' protests/unrest, dominated by agriculturists from Punjab,"" added another officer.Pakistan not only sheltered the leadership of prominent pro-Khalistan outfits like Babbar Khalsa International and Khalistan Tiger Force for the past several years, but also continued to press on the pro-Khalistan pedal through projects like the Sikhs for Justice's 'Khalistan Referendum 2020'.The Sikh diaspora, in which the extremists seem to hold sway, provided funding and resources to pro-Khalistan elements, even as Pakistan-backed actors whipped up communal tensions and ensured a steady supply of arms. That even laws like UAPA could not hold back terrorists like Chaura for long, enabling him to get relief from the courts and go back to extremist activities, made the threat of radicals crushing any moderate voices, even more real.""Those born after 1993, when Sikh militancy had faded out due to a tough police crackdown and dominance of moderate voices, were in the past two decades fed on lies that 1.5 lakh people were killed in the militancy era, when the actual number of deaths was around 22,000, including 1,800 police personnel. Radical voices like Simranjit Singh Mann building a popular base by fighting polls and the emergence of radical leaders like Waaris Panjab De chief Amritpal Singh are proof that pro-Khalistan sentiments have been on the rise in Punjab,"" said a former intelligence officer.The solution, several officers told TOI, lay in promoting moderate voices to neutralise 'radical fringe', strengthening police's hands to deal with extremists and tightening anti-terror laws.","Shiromani Akali Dal chief and former Punjab deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal narrowly escaped assassination.

Ajmer 'survey': Dargah'diplomacy' under a cloud,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/ajmer-survey-dargahdiplomacy-under-a-cloud/articleshow/115991214.cms,"'Ajmer dargah enhances India's image'

JAIPUR/AJMER: The raging controversy following claims of the existence of a Shiva temple beneath the Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti Dargah in Ajmer has put a question mark over the longstanding tradition of top political leaders and diplomats offering 'chadar' at the shrine ahead of the annual Urs festival, which begins on Jan 2.The claims stem from a petition filed by right-wing organisation Hindu Sena. Tensions rose last week after the Ajmer munsif court issued notices to the Union ministry of minority affairs, Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), and the Dargah committee on Nov 27, following the petition.Social media has since been flooded with debates and videos amplifying the issue.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has regularly offered 'chadar' to the shrine after he assumed office in 2014, continuing a legacy that dates back to the country's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. Rajasthan's chief ministers and governors, apart from official delegations from the govts of Pakistan and Bangladesh, traditionally sent offerings to the dargah during the annual Urs. The festival attracts lakhs of devotees from India and South Asia.""The matter is highly sensitive. A 'chadar' from PM Modi might provoke backlash from Hindutva groups as it could be seen as tacit support for the dargah, countering the petition,"" a senior RSS leader said in Jaipur.On Wednesday, the emergency response team (ERT) of the Rajasthan ATS conducted an inspection of the dargah and surrounding areas, including Khadim Mohalla, Jhalra Uppar, Ander Kot, and Dhai Din Ka Jhopra, causing panic among the locals. ""The police claim it's a routine exercise, but I have never seen such a large number of armed personnel marching through the area,"" said Muzaffar Bharti, a member of the Dargah Mauraisi Amla (service clan).Despite the stir the ERT created locally, officials on condition of anonymity said this was a ""routine inspection"" done every year. ""This is to check internal security measures at all 10 gates,"" An ERT official said.Ajmer SP Vandita Rana also inspected the dargah region and directed officials to install CCTV cameras, scanners and take all security measures at all gates.Official offerings from Pakistan and Bangladesh are traditionally vetted by the Indian govt before being presented at the shrine. However, the ongoing controversy raises questions about whether this year's offerings and delegations from these nations will receive the usual clearances. ""Given the situation, it will be interesting to see if the Union govt allows 'chadar' from Pakistan and Bangladesh, which are typically delivered by their high commissioners under tight security,"" said a source.'Chadar' offerings often come with messages from the heads of state of respective countries, a practice foreign relations experts refer to as "" Dargah diplomacy "".

The shooter then continued to walk westbound on the Avenue of the Americas, where he got on to an electric Citi Bike and rode northbound towards Central Park, CBS news reported.Police say they recovered three live 9mm rounds and three discharged 9mm shell casings. Authorities also recovered a cellphone.Authorities are also investigating the suspect's point of origin.Surveillance images released by the police show the suspect at a Starbucks, located two blocks from the incident, moments before the shooting.

However, officials are cautious about issuing pardons to individuals who haven't committed crimes, as it might appear improper and validate Trump's criticisms.The discussions, led by White House counsel Ed Siskel and chief of staff Jeff Zients, encompass both current officeholders and former officials who have drawn Trump's ire. Potential candidates include Sen.-elect Adam Schiff, former Rep. Liz Cheney, and Dr Fauci. Trump has previously stated that ""Cheney should go to Jail along with the rest of the Unselect Committee!""As soon as the report came, Dr Fauci's odds of being pardoned by President Biden skyrocket on Polymarket.These deliberations reflect growing concerns among Democrats about potential retribution under a second Trump presidency. The recent broad pardon of Hunter Biden demonstrates the administration's worries about future prosecutions.Some Democratic lawmakers support preemptive pardons, citing the precedent of Gerald Ford's pardon of Richard Nixon. Senator Ed Markey and Representative Brendan Boyle have publicly advocated for such measures. However, others, including potential recipients like Schiff, have expressed reservations.A particular concern for Biden's team is the financial burden of legal defence that investigations could impose on officials. Some appointees are reportedly seeking higher-paying positions to prepare for potential legal expenses.The administration also faces pressure to extend clemency to ordinary citizens, particularly following Hunter Biden's pardon. Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries has called for pardons for working-class Americans imprisoned for non-violent offences, as per Politico.The central question revolves around interpreting Trump's statements about potential retribution against Democrats and perceived Deep State opponents, considering both their seriousness and literal implications.Historical presidential pardons have sparked controversy, yet the current situation facing Biden officials appears more complex than previous cases, such as George HW Bush's pardon of Caspar Weinberger or Bill Clinton's pardon of Marc Rich. The situation intensifies as Trump's associates discuss potential tribunals against opponents.The president's decision to pardon his son has created additional complications, particularly amongst Democratic Party members already concerned about Biden's re-election campaign at age 82. The administration now faces questions about extending similar legal protection to officials who have drawn criticism from Trump and his supporters.Congressional Democrats present conflicting viewpoints. Senator Ed Markey (D-Mass.) has referenced Gerald Ford's pre-emptive pardon of Richard Nixon as a potential model, noting its implementation before any formal charges.""If it's clear by January 19 that [revenge] is his intention, then I would recommend to President Biden that he provide those preemptive pardons to people, because that's really what our country is going to need next year,"" Markey said on WGBH last week.Representative Brendan Boyle (D-Penn.), who recently hosted Biden in his district, has advocated for comprehensive pardons. ""This is no hypothetical threat,"" Boyle stated, continuing: ""The time for cautious restraint is over. We must act with urgency to push back against these threats and prevent Trump from abusing his power.""","US President Joe Biden’s senior aides in the White House are conducting a vigorous internal debate over issuing preemptive pardons to protect public officials.

Why Joe Biden pardoned his son

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre came under fire Monday after President Joe Biden announced pardon to his son Hunter Biden -- a move any hint of which was consistently shot down by the White House. And the press secretary, whenever asked whether Biden would pardon his son, said no. On Monday, Jean-Pierre was asked aboard Air Force One why she persistently lied about the issue to which the press secretary reacted by saying: ""The president took an action because of how politically infected these cases were.""“The system doesn’t get corrupted by politics for people whose name is not Biden?” a reporter asked. “You’re twisting and misrepresenting what I’m saying. I’m talking about a particular issue right now,” Jean-Pierre said.“Does the president believe now and agree with President-elect Trump that the justice system has been weaponized for political purposes and that it needs root and branch reform?” another asked.“No. Read the president’s statement. Seriously, read the president’s statement. He said he believes in the Department of Justice. He does. He says it in his statement. He also believes that war politics infected the process and it led to a miscarriage of justice,” she said.In his statement, Joe Biden said he wrestled with the decision which was made over the weekend. ""I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice — and once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further. I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision,"" Biden said.""No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter’s cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son — and that is wrong,"" Biden said in his statement. ""There has been an effort to break Hunter — who has been five and a half years sober, even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution. In trying to break Hunter, they’ve tried to break me — and there’s no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough.""Hunter Biden was scheduled to be sentenced on December 12 for his conviction on federal gun charges. On December 16, he was to be sentenced for a separate criminal case of tax evasion.","Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, repeatedly said Joe Biden would not pardon his son Hunter Biden.

Ousted Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina accused country's interim leader Muhammad Yunus of failing to safeguard minority communities and perpetrating what she described as ""genocide.""In her first public address since resigning in August amidst widespread anti-government protests, Hasina, speaking virtually at an event in New York, alleged targeted attacks on religious minorities, including Hindus, Buddhists, and Christians.Speaking at an event marking Bangladesh's Vijay Diwas , the Awami League leader highlighted the worsening plight of minorities under the current regime. ""What is this persecution of minorities for? Why are they being ruthlessly attacked?"" she questioned.She also claimed there was a plot to assassinate her and her sister Sheikh Rehana, mirroring the tragic fate of their father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who was assassinated in 1975.According to a report by news agency PTI, she referred to her ouster and the violent storming of her official residence, Ganabhaban, on August 5. Hasina said, “The armed protestors were directed toward Ganabhaban. If the security guards had opened fire, many lives would have been lost. I was forced to leave, and I told them not to fire no matter what happened.”Hasina, speaking in Bengali, said Yunus and other leaders of the interim government were orchestrating violence against minorities. “Today, I am being accused of genocide. In reality, Yunus has been involved in genocide in a meticulously designed manner. Hindus, Buddhists, Christians – no one has been spared. Eleven churches have been razed, temples and Buddhist shrines have been broken. When Hindus protested, the Iskcon leader was arrested.”She further alleged that her decision to leave Bangladesh in August was aimed at reducing violence but lamented that attacks on minorities had only intensified.During the event, Hasina also alleged a conspiracy to assassinate her and her sister. “When people were dying indiscriminately, I decided I should leave,” she said, adding that the violence continued despite her resignation.India has expressed growing concerns over escalating violence and persecution of minorities, particularly Hindus, in Bangladesh.Bangladesh's interim government head, Muhammad Yunus, has accused the ousted Sheikh Hasina regime of ""destroying everything"" and vowed to delay general elections until sweeping constitutional and judicial reforms are implemented. The remarks came in an interview with Nikkei Asia and were reported by Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha on Wednesday.The 84-year-old Nobel laureate emphasised the need for comprehensive changes in governance before the country can proceed to the polls. ""We need comprehensive reforms in the economy, governance, bureaucracy, and judiciary (before holding elections),"" Yunus said.Yunus also reiterated his government's intent to seek Sheikh Hasina’s extradition from India once her trial in Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal concludes. “Once the trial concludes and a verdict is reached, we will formally request India to hand her over,” Yunus said, adding that an international treaty signed by both nations would obligate India to comply.","Ousted Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina accused country's interim leader Muhammad Yunus of failing to safeguard minority communities.

Media criticism

Allegations cloud nomination

Penelope Hegseth , the mother of Pete Hegseth , President-elect Donald Trump ’s nominee for secretary of defence, is now defending her son after previously accusing him of mistreating women in a 2018 email.Speaking on Fox News’ ‘Fox & Friends’ on Wednesday, she claimed her earlier words were written ""in haste"" and with ""deep emotions"" during a difficult period in her son’s life.“I wrote that out of love,” Penelope said during the interview, explaining that the email was sent during Pete’s contentious divorce from his second wife, Samantha.The email, published by The New York Times, accused Pete of being an “abuser of women” and criticised him for “dishonesty, sleeping around, betrayal, debasing, and belittling.” However, she noted that just two hours later, she sent an apology email retracting her accusations, although that email has not surfaced publicly.Penelope Hegseth took aim at The New York Times for publishing her email, accusing the outlet of threatening her for a comment. “They say, ‘Unless you make a statement, we will publish it as is.’ I think that’s a despicable way to treat anyone,” she told Fox News.She expressed gratitude to Trump for his belief in her son, stating, “Trump knows Pete. And he knows the Pete of today.” Penelope described her son as a devoted patriot and father, adding, “He’s fought and almost died for this country.”Hegseth’s nomination has been overshadowed by a slew of allegations, including sexual misconduct, financial mismanagement at veterans' charities, and concerns over his drinking habits.A 2017 police report alleged sexual assault, which Hegseth denied but later settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. The New Yorker also detailed claims from former colleagues that Hegseth turned a blind eye to harassment and engaged in inappropriate behaviour while leading veteran advocacy groups.Despite these accusations, Hegseth has remained resolute. Speaking to CBS News, he said, “Why would I back down? I’ve always been a fighter. I’m here for the fighters.”President-elect Trump has so far stood by Hegseth, reportedly telling him to “keep fighting” amid the increasing criticism.As the allegations mount, speculation has arisen that Trump may replace Hegseth with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis , a former Navy legal officer. DeSantis, who was initially considered for the role, is reportedly back on the shortlist, as doubts about Hegseth’s confirmation continue to grow.Meanwhile, Hegseth continues to meet with Republican senators to garner support, but his path to confirmation appears increasingly challenging.Reports from CBS News indicate that several senators, including Lindsey Graham, have expressed concerns about the “disturbing” allegations.","Penelope Hegseth previously accused her son of mistreating women in an email.

Not once did I suspect he had consumed anything other than an egg sandwich and coffee before going on air.""Her statement follows NBC News's report citing ""10 current and former Fox employees"" who alleged smelling alcohol on Hegseth before broadcasts, a claim Saphier, along with other Fox personalities, has categorically denied.Will Cain, a current cohost of Fox & Friends, described the allegations as ""horses***"" on X, while fellow cohost Rachel Campos-Duffy echoed similar sentiments, criticising NBC for relying on anonymous sources and not reaching out to Hegseth's closest colleagues.Campos-Duffy stated, ""The losers at NBC News never reached out to me either… You now have 2 people who sat next to him 8+ hours a week on the record.""Other Fox News contributors have also rallied behind Hegseth. Guy Benson, Joey Jones, and Lisa Boothe all dismissed the claims as baseless, with Boothe calling the report a ""malicious smear.""Piers Morgan, a frequent guest on Fox & Friends, also lent his voice in support, describing Hegseth as ""utterly professional on camera and a nice, respectful guy off it.""The controversy has surfaced at a pivotal moment for Hegseth, who has been nominated by President-elect Donald Trump to serve as the next US Secretary of Defense.A Trump transition spokesperson categorically denied the allegations, describing them as ""disgusting"" and politically motivated attacks against a ""decorated combat veteran.""As the controversies around Pete Hegseth continue to mount, Trump is reportedly considering replacing Hegseth with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis as his pick for secretary of defence, reported the Wall Street Journal.","Nicole Saphier, a Fox News contributor, has strongly defended her colleague Pete Hegseth following an NBC News report alleging concerns about his on-air conduct.

PESHAWAR: The death toll from sectarian violence in Pakistan's restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province surged to 130, with at least six people killed and eight injured on Sunday, as clashes in the volatile Kurram district continued for the eleventh consecutive day.The clashes between Alizai and Bagan tribes in the district started on November 22, after an attack on a convoy of passenger vans near Parachinar in which 47 people were killed a day earlier. Several passengers who had sustained grave injuries succumbed later, raising the toll in the convoy killing to 57.Police said the situation remained tense, and violence persists despite a recent ceasefire agreement between the Sunni and Shia groups.The six new deaths reported on Sunday brought the death toll to 130, while the total number of injured rose to 186 after eight fresh injuries were reported.The 10-day truce brokered last week has been rendered ineffective by intermittent violence, which shows no signs of abating.A high-powered delegation, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Secretary Nadeem Aslam Chaudhry and IGP Akhtar Hayat Gandapur, had also negotiated a ceasefire last weekend, but violence resumed shortly afterwards.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi earlier planned to dispatch members of the grandpeace jirga (council of tribal leaders) from Kohat division to Kurram for engaging with leaders from both warring factions to negotiate peace.Addressing a gathering of political leaders and tribal elders in Kohat on Sunday, he called for strict action with public cooperation to make the region weapon-free through joint operations.He said he was ready to go to Kurram and stay there for as many days as the jirga suggested to ensure peace in the region.""No other country or province will resolve our issues. We must take responsibility for improving the situation ourselves,"" he said.Kundi announced an All-Parties Conference (APC) for peace and the province's rights and invited Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur to join it.The governor stressed the role of religious scholars in promoting peace, urging them to focus on unity.Several other leaders addressed the gathering, putting aside their ideological differences on other issues.The continued violence forced the closure of the main Peshawar-Parachinar Road for travel, and commuting at the Pak-Afghan Kharlachi border has also been suspended.The closure of the main arteries has created a scarcity of oil, food commodities and medicines in the region.The Kurram region is also experiencing a communication blackout, with mobile and internet services suspended and educational institutions closed.Police and other security forces personnel had been deployed in various parts of Lower Kurram, said Deputy Commissioner Javed Ullah Mehsud, adding that all-out efforts will be made for a truce in other areas today as well.""We are hopeful for progress on a ceasefire and reopening of transport routes,"" he stated.Previous efforts to mediate peace, including a seven-day truce brokered by provincial officials in November have failed to hold.","Death toll from sectarian violence in Pakistan's restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province surges to 130.
