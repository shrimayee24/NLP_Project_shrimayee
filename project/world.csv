Op Sindoor Continued After May 10 as Every Decision Had Long-Term Implications, Says Army Chief

NEW DELHI: Releasing a book on Operation Sindoor , Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi on Friday said the India-Pakistan conflict did not end with the May 10 ceasefire understanding but “continued for a long time.”The book, ""Operation Sindoor: The Untold Story of India’s Deep Strikes Inside Pakistan"", has been authored by former army officer KJS Dhillon, a veteran.“You may be thinking that on May 10, the war finished; no, because it continued for a long time, with many decisions still to be taken. Beyond that, of course, it will be difficult for me to share here,” General Dwivedi said at the launch event, according to PTI.""India announced its resolve with a new normal, with outstanding clarity in strategic guidance, with a whole-of-nation approach for execution,"" he asserted in his address.The army chief also noted how, throughout the conflict, the force ""moved something like a rhythmic wave.""""When I say rhythmic wave, in these 88 hours, it was not possible for you to come for the planning, pass the orders... so, everybody was synergised, and everybody knew his orders,"" he explained.Hours after the ceasefire took effect on May 10, Pakistan had sent drones into Indian border states — a move it repeated the next night.On his part, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has repeatedly emphasised that Operation Sindoor has only been “paused.”It was launched on May 7 in retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack , in which Pakistan-backed terrorists killed 26 civilians. Under it, the Indian forces struck multiple terror infrastructures across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in what the government described as “focused, measured and non-escalatory” action.Pakistan retaliated with offensives, prompting Indian counter-strikes, and the conflict dragged on for nearly four days. On May 10, Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations reached out to his Indian counterpart seeking a ceasefire, which India accepted.","Op Sindoor Continued After May 10 as Every Decision Had Long-Term Implications, Says Army Chief.

New Delhi Locks Eyes With Trump After ‘Lost India’ Dig; Blasts Peter Navarro | Tariff War

NEW DELHI: Senior White House adviser Peter Navarro on Friday renewed his attack on India, accusing New Delhi of profiteering from Russian oil and imposing tariffs that he says cost Americans their jobs.In a post on X on Friday, Navarro wrote: “FACTS: India highest tariffs costs US jobs. India buys Russian oil purely to profit/Revenues feed Russia war machine. Ukrainians/Russians die. US taxpayers shell out more. India can't handle truth/spins”His remarks came in response to a Washington Post article that said Washington’s harsh language toward New Delhi was worsening ties.Navarro has repeatedly targeted India for its refusal to halt trade with Moscow, calling the conflict “Modi’s war,” branding the country “Kremlin’s laundromat,” and alleging it was profiting from the war.Meanwhile, in an interview with Bloomberg Television last week, he had claimed: “India is helping feed the Russian war machine. I mean Modi's war, because the road to peace runs, in part, through New Delhi.”The ministry of external affairs (MEA) rejected his comments. Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said: “We have seen the inaccurate and misleading statements made by Navarro, and obviously, we reject them.”He added, “We remain focused on the substantive agenda that our two countries have committed to, and we hope that the relationship will continue to move forward based on mutual respect and shared interests.”Earlier on Friday, White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said that President Donald Trump and his trade team were “disappointed” with India’s continued imports of Russian crude oil but expressed hope for “positive developments.”Trump himself has repeatedly described India as America’s “most tariffed partner,” calling the trade relationship a “totally one-sided disaster.” He argues that while India exports large volumes of goods to the US, its high tariffs restrict American companies from accessing the Indian market. A US appeals court recently ruled that several of Trump’s tariff measures were “illegal.”",White House trade advisor Peter Navarro renewed his attack on India on Friday.

No Comments: India Reacts To Trump’s Shocking Claim Of Losing India To China After Modi-Xi Bonhomie

Poll Do you agree with Peter Navarro's remarks about India profiting from Russian crude oil? Yes, I agree No, I disagree

NEW DELHI: India on Friday strongly rejected Peter Navarro's ""Brahmins profiting from Russian crude"" remark, calling the statement inaccurate and misleading.Navarro, trade advisor to US President Donald Trump , made an obtuse remark claiming that New Delhi has been ""indirectly funding"" Russia’s war in Ukraine through discounted oil purchases, and that Brahmins are ""profiting at the expense of Indians"".""We have seen the inaccurate and misleading statements made by Mr. (Peter) Navarro and obviously, we reject them"", said MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.He further said: ""Talks between both countries is going on and we are committed to strengthening our partnership.""During an interview with a pro-Republican Fox News, Navarro said, ""Look, Modi's a great leader.

So I would just simply say to the Indian people: please, understand what's going on here. You've got Brahmins profiteering at the expense of the Indian people. We need that to stop. Yeah, and we'll be watching that closely.""Navarro's statement ignited backlash not only from BJP but also from the opposition in India. Congress leader Pawan Khera criticised Navarro's ""Brahmin"" remark to justify US tariffs on India, and called it ""baseless."" Speaking to ANI, Pawan Khera said, ""America should not make baseless statements like this.""BJP MP Dinesh Sharma slammed Navarro for his 'Brahmin' remarks and said that the statement is factually wrong, culturally insensitive, and out of context in terms of India's economic decisions. This is pertinent to mention that it is the BJP's first reaction to the remarks.The floor seems to have fallen out of the dwindling India–US relationship under Trump, who has accused New Delhi of ""fueling"" Russia’s war in Ukraine.On Friday, Trump took a dig at the recently concluded China-hosted SCO summit by sharing a photo of PM Modi with Chinese president Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.""Looks like we’ve lost India and Russia to deepest, darkest, China.

TOI correspondent from Washington:

(May be updated)

With a single cryptic post, US President Donald Trump on Friday signaled a tectonic shift in global alignments, taking America deeper into an isolationist and antagonistic stance by clubbing India, Russia, and China together as allies. The post also appeared to publicly cede to China a leadership position adversarial to the US.""Looks like we’ve lost India and Russia to deepest, darkest, China. May they have a long and prosperous future together!"" Trump posted first thing on the morning on Friday, sending shock waves across the world, including in the US strategic community that did not anticipate such a stark and public indication of a geopolitical realigment.There was much for analysts to unpack in the 20-word post by America's mercurial President, who often takes to social media to troll and taunt adversaries and sometimes even allies.First, there was the sense of resignation and acknowledgement that he, with his MAGA vision for US, has lost India and Russia (mentioned in that order), countries he implicitly seemed to expect to be aligned with Washington. Then the negative characterisation of China as a ""deepest, darkest"" entity, which seemed to suggest that he now regarded it as a conspiratorial and primary adversary.Calling the US President's evolving stance arguably ""the greatest own goal in modern foreign policy,"" CNN commentator Fareed Zakaria said Trump's tariffs and rhetoric had caused many of the world’s pivotal states are to move away from the US toward China. The Trump post seemed to concede it was a self-goal.It is rare for Trump to admit any loss, in keeping with the core principles of his book Art of the Deal, which emphasizes never conceding defeat and claiming victory even in the face of setbacks. The sense of resignation, unless it is read as a negotiating tactic or sarcasm, was unreal and un-Trumplike.Indeed, the post surprised even Trump surrogates, who held their counsel for now as they tried to figure out the President's motive for such a cryptic but provocative post. Some of Trump's cabinet principals and the non-partisan bureaucracy have been quietly working to keep the India ties on an even keel, given the time and energy both sides have expended on the construct that it will be the most consequential and ""defining relationship of the 21st century. "" Even some MAGA megaphones read more sarcasm than any drastic realignment in the post. The NYPost read it as nothing more than a ""snarky takedown"" of Russia and India ""cozying"" up to China.Absent any immediate elaboration about the post from the administration, trolls and agent provocateurs on social media had a field day, from taunting the US President with his signature ""Thank you for your attention to this matter!"" to gibing if he had taken his morning medication.India partisans ridiculed him for his recent embrace of Pakistan, attributing it to his family's business interest in cryptocurrency that is reported to have netted $5 billion through a firm wooed by Islamabad. ""Actually you are left with Pakistan. Rest entire world has abandoned you already,"" gibed one post, while another wished Trump ""a happy future with jihadis"" for ""forgetting 9/11 and where Osama bin Laden was found. ""MAGA xenophobes too jumped into the fray, one of them suggesting ""it is time we put the Indian people in camps and mass deport them."" Trump's increasingly antagonistic stance towards India has unleashed a torrent of racial abuse and slurs on the far right.","US President Donald Trump on Friday signaled a tectonic shift in global alignments.

NEW DELHI: Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) Anil Chauhan explained why India chose to go beyond drones and loitering munitions during Operation Sindoor , saying lethal action against Pakistan-bred terrorists required air power.CDS Chauhan said precision strikes had been carried out against terrorists holed up in Pakistan even after the attacks in Uri and Pulwama, and therefore, India already had ""enhanced precision strike capabilities"".He said it was decided that destroying terrorist camps in Bahawalpur and Muridke required air power, as this would help achieve the political objective -- possibly a reference to reaffirming India’s stand of zero tolerance against terrorism.Speaking at an event in Gorakhpur, CDS Chauhan said: India and Pakistan learned different lessons after the Balakot operation.

In the past too, the head of govt has been inscribed on the list of speakers only to later have the EAM fill in for the PM.According to sources, UNGA is not a part of PM's travel schedule for now, and things are likely to remain that way, barring a last-minute breakthrough in India's trade talks with the US leading to a proposal for a meeting with President Donald Trump . As things stand now, any such development seems unlikely.If he travels all the way to New York, the PM would ideally want to have a bilateral meeting with Trump. However, in the current circumstances, govt believes it's best to avoid a high-stakes meeting between the leaders. Jaishankar is certain to be there and will meet many of his counterparts on the margins, including Ukraine foreign minister Andrii Sybiha.Trump is also reportedly upset with Modi for not hopping over to Washington from Canada where the PM was attending the G7 summit. However, the fact that the President was hosting Pakistan army chief Asim Munir at the same time made it impossible for Modi to travel to the capital.",S Jaishankar will travel to New York this month for the 80th session of the UN General Assembly.

The Meitei group argued that Manipur being under President's rule, the state administration lacked the constitutional and moral authority to represent people in tripartite talks.""The decision to extend the SoO under such circumstances is illegitimate and reflects an undemocratic and hegemonic imposition on the indigenous people and elected representatives of Manipur,"" COCOMI said.On NH2 being reopened, it said turning citizens' free movement into a bargaining chip with armed groups violates constitutional rights and leaves the Meitei population ""vulnerable"".Manipur has been under President's rule since Feb 13, clamped within a week of N Biren Singh resigning as CM on Feb 9.

In contrast, only 13 persons from SC/ST category were recommended for judgeship, it said, and alleged that injustice has been done to those belonging to Dalit and tribal communities.The PIL asked - ""Whether the SC Collegium acted unconstitutionally and illegally in conceding to the request of the central govt to consider names of persons belonging to minority communities?"" - and requested the SC on the judicial side to restrain govt from appointing the individuals, who have been recommended based on their religion, as HC judges.","The Supreme Court collegium system, under criticism for its opaqueness, faces an uncomfortable question.

S Jaishankar To Join BRICS Online Summit As Member Nations Unite Against Trump’s Tariff War

NEW DELHI: India will be represented in the Brics leaders' virtual summit that Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will convene on Sept 8 by external affairs minister S Jaishankar, and not PM Narendra Modi. The leaders' meeting will discuss ways to deal with Trump's tariffs, along with efforts to boost multilateralism, and may be followed by a joint statement. The ministry of external affairs (MEA) said Friday that Jaishankar will join the virtual summit.Brazil is not projecting it as an anti-US summit, but Modi's decision to skip the event, even as India prepares to assume the Brics presidency next year, suggests an effort to balance out his participation in the SCO summit that was seen as a reassertion of India's strategic autonomy in the middle of a trade crisis with Washington.Launching into another rant against India for its participation in Brics, US secretary of commerce Howard Lutnick said Friday India should either support the dollar and the US, or be ready to pay a 50% tariff. Ironically, within Brics, India has always emphatically rejected the idea of de-dollarisation, maintaining it's not a part of its strategy.Modi's show of camaraderie with Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on the margins of SCO summit in Tianjin also vindicated the point many have made about Trump driving India into the arms of China with his trade policy.However, as MEA reiterated Friday, India sees its relationship with the US as important and will continue to pursue the substantive agenda that both countries have committed to, hoping that the relationship will continue to move forward based on mutual respect and shared interests. India has stressed on the significance of mutual respect in the relationship, as senior Trump administration officials' launch frequently into anti-India tirades.While both Brazil and India have been slapped with 50% tariffs by the US president, in Brazil's case it's more about political vengeance than trade. Trump has targeted Brazil for the prosecution of his political ally, right-wing leader and former president Jair Bolsonaro. Trump has imposed an additional 25% tariff on India for its purchase of Russian crude. Brazil has so far not announced the names of other leaders who will join the meeting.","Brazil is not projecting it as an anti-US summit, but Modi's decision to skip the event suggests an effort to balance out his participation in the SCO summit.

Kashmir sees political fight over defacing of National Emblem in Hazratbal shrine & religious holiday,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kashmir-sees-political-fight-over-defacing-of-national-emblem-in-hazratbal-shrine-religious-holiday/articleshow/123726256.cms,"SRINAGAR: Unidentified worshippers defaced the inauguration plaque bearing the National Emblem of India at Srinagar’s Hazratbal Shrine after Friday prayers, leading to J&K Waqf Board chairperson and BJP politician Darakhshan Andrabi blaming National Conference for “defacing the plaque and removing the emblem”.Politically, the Valley had already been tense since Friday morning after the LG-led J&K administration had drawn sharp criticism from politicians and religious clerics for failing to reschedule the Eid-e-Milad-un-Nabi holiday to Saturday, in line with the lunar calendar. Instead, the LG-led administration observed a public holiday on account of Eid-e-Milad on Friday, a day earlier than the actual date of commencement of Eid-e-Milad, marking the birth anniversary of Prophet Muhammad.Andrabi responded from the shrine itself, holding a press conference on Friday evening where she said, “Those who broke the emblem at Hazratbal Dargah should be booked under the PSA. It is like a cloudburst that broke on me after I saw the emblem being broken.” She also asked police and waqf officials to bodily search the MLA if and when he visits the shrine “so that there are no currency notes in his pocket (because they bear the National Emblem).Otherwise, if he has, then that will be ‘makroh (disapproved of but not strictly forbidden)…’”.The plaque had been installed by the J&K Waqf Board to mark the reconstruction and redevelopment of the shrine, inaugurated on Sept 3. Andrabi had already faced muted criticism on social media for allowing the National Emblem-bearing plaque inside the shrine.NC chief spokesperson and party legislator Tanvir Sadiq said idol worship is strictly forbidden in Islam. “The foundation of our faith is Tawheed (Islamic monotheism). Placing a sculpted figure at the revered Hazratbal Dargah goes against this very belief. Sacred spaces must reflect only the purity of Tawheed, nothing else,” Sadiq said.NC MP from Srinagar Aga Ruhullah Mehdi said, “A sacred place that has stood for centuries needs no one’s nameplate for legitimacy. People were rightly offended by this dangerous attempt to play with religious sensitivities for self-glorification,"" Mehdi said. He said Hazratbal has seen reconstructions before, but never were such means used to claim credit. “Any talk of using PSA in this case only adds insult to injury. It is foolish, unacceptable, and an assault on people’s attachment to their beloved shrine.""PDP representative Iltija Mufti reacted sharply to Andrabi's statement, saying that “labelling Kashmiris as ‘terrorists’ just because they expressed their anger at something which hurt their religious sentiments, and asking police to slap them with PSA, reflects BJPs punitive and communal mindset.” She added: “The waqf board should certainly have been more mindful & sensitive. It seems that Muslims are being deliberately being provoked. ”J&K minister Sakina Itoo said it was unjust that Eid-e-Milad was not observed as a holiday on the correct date in J&K. “What does ‘subject to appearance of the Moon’ mean if it is not followed? Despite repeated requests from the elected govt to shift the holiday, no action has been taken,” she said. “This is playing with the emotions of the people,” she added.CM Omar Abdullah joined her, stating that “the calendar printed by the govt press is very clear — “Subject to the appearance of the Moon”. It means that the holiday is subject to change depending upon the Moon being sighted. The deliberate decision by the unelected govt to not shift the holiday is inconsiderate and designed to hurt the sentiments of the people.” Mirwaiz Umar Farooq also condemned the move.",Unidentified worshippers defaced the plaque bearing the National Emblem of India at Srinagar’s Hazratbal Shrine after Friday prayers.

PUNE: The 19-year-old son of one of the jailed co-accused in the murder of former NCP corporator Vanraj Andekar on Sept 1 last year was shot dead by two unidentified assailants in the crowded Nana Peth area around 7.45pm on Friday, causing panic and tension in the heart of the city during peak Ganeshotsav rush on the eve of immersion day.Police identified the victim as Ayush Komkar, who is the son of Ganesh Komkar, one of the 21 accused lodged in Yerawada central jail in the Andekar murder case. Ayush is also Vanraj's nephew. His father, Ganesh, is the husband of one of Vanraj's two sisters with whom the former corporator was involved in a property dispute that became one of the contributory motives behind his murder last year, the police said.The murder comes barely days after the Pune police claimed to have foiled a plot to kill the relatives of Somnath Gaikwad and Aniket Dudhbhate, the other two key accused in the Andekar murder case, at Ambegaon Pathar.Pune's joint commissioner of police, Ranjan Kumar Sharma, told TOI: ""Prima facie, revenge appears to be the motive behind the murder. However, we are examining all possible angles considering that the victim (Ayush) had no direct link with Vanraj Andekar's murder.""Sharma cited preliminary information gathered from the spot and said the victim had reached the basement parking area of an apartment building close to the Navrang Ganesh Mandal near Palkhi Vithoba Chowk after attending his tuition class.At this time, two men drove near him on a bike. ""Before anyone could understand what they were up to, the duo fired three bullets at the victim and swiftly drove away from the spot,"" he said.The body has been sent to Sassoon General Hospital, and a preliminary postmortem report is awaited. ""Eleven teams from the Samarth police and crime branch units have been formed to trace and arrest the assailants. For now, our teams are examining CCTV footage collected from various establishments in the vicinity and are recording statements of witnesses who were present around the crime scene. A forensic team is also at the spot to collect vital pieces of evidence,"" the joint CP said.Shops and establishments around the crime spot downed their shutters amid panic soon after the firing incident. ""There is no law-and-order situation as of now and the situation is under control,"" additional commissioner of police (East region) Rajesh Bansode told TOI.City police commissioner Amitesh Kumar, additional commissioner of police (crime) Pankaj Deshmukh, DCPs Krushikesh Rawale and Nikhil Pingale along with Sharma aand Bansode visited the scene of crime.Earlier this week, the police had detained an associate of Vanraj's father, Suryakant alias Bandu Andekar, who heads the Andekar gang, on charges of conducting a recce on the targeted victims at Ambegaon Pathar. The detained associate was released later with a notice asking him to cooperate with the investigation. The police also arrested two men and seized a country-made pistol and two bullets, which they were to hand over to seven others of the Andekar gang to execute the murder plot on Sept 1, the first death anniversary of Vanraj.Asked about this background, Sharma said, ""We have foiled the murder plot at Ambegaon Pathar by making a couple of arrests and recovering five country-made pistols so far. Our investigation will also focus on establishing a link between that plot and the present crime.""In Feb this year, the police filed a voluminous chargesheet against Sanjeevani Komkar, who is Vanraj's sister, and 20 other accused, along with two minors, involved in the Vanraj Andekar murder case.It is the police's case that a festering gang rivalry between Vanraj's father, Suryakant alias Bandu Andekar (68), and the latter's former aide, Somnath Gaikwad, combined with Vanraj's property dispute with his two sisters, who are married to the Komkar brothers — Jayant and Ganesh — resulted in a conspiracy to eliminate Vanraj. Jayant's other younger brother Prakash is a close aide of Gaikwad, and they planned the murder, the police said. The suspects wanted to hit Suryakant where it hurt most. Vanraj was looking after his father's finances and business interests in Nana Peth, police said.Gaikwad broke away from the Andekar gang in 2021 and started his own criminal outfit at Ambegaon Pathar with a group of Andekar's men from Nana Peth shifting allegiance to him, police added. Gaikwad's aide, Aniket Dudhbhate, who led the assailants in the attack on Vanraj, was looking for a chance to get back at Suryakant, who was among the six men arrested in the Oct 5, 2023, murder of his (Aniket's) close friend Nikhil Akhade, the police said.","19-year-old son of jailed co-accused in Andekar murder case gunned down in Pune.

Marco Rubio Makes Big Charge Against Venezuela As Trump Orders War On Drug Cartels

‘It won’t stop with just this strike’

Maduro deploys troops in response





Defense secretary Pete Hegseth on Wednesday issued a stern warning after a US military strike destroyed a Venezuelan drug boat in the Caribbean, killing 11 suspected members of the Tren de Aragua gang.“It's a new day. It's a different day, and… this is an activity the United States is not going to tolerate in our hemisphere,” Hegseth said on Fox & Friends.He described the operation as a direct hit against a “narco-terrorist organization” seeking to “poison” the United States with illicit drugs.“We knew exactly who was in that boat. We know exactly what they were doing, and we knew exactly who they represented,” he said.Hegseth stressed that the action was carried out with “precision” and said more operations will follow. “It won't stop with just this strike. Anyone else trafficking in those waters, who we know is a designated narco-terrorist, will face the same fate, and it's important for the American people to protect our homeland and protect our hemisphere,” he said.Venezuelan minister of communication and information Freddy Nanez dismissed video of the fiery explosion as AI-generated, but Hegseth rejected the claim.“I can tell you that was definitely not artificial intelligence. I watched it live,” he said, as qupted by Fox News.US President Donald Trump confirmed the attack early Wednesday, releasing footage of the explosion and calling it a warning to cartels.“The strike occurred while the terrorists were at sea in international waters transporting illegal narcotics, heading to the United States. The strike resulted in 11 terrorists killed in action. No US Forces were harmed in this strike,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.He added, “Please let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America.”Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro responded to the strike by deploying troops along the coast and border with Colombia, while urging citizens to join a civilian militia.Maduro has long argued that the US exaggerates Venezuela’s role in drug trafficking to push for regime change. He and other officials have pointed to a United Nations report suggesting only a small fraction of Colombia’s cocaine moves through Venezuelan territory.","US defense secretary Pete Hegseth issued a stern warning after a US military strike destroyed a Venezuelan drug boat in the Caribbean. “It's a new day.

A surprising allegation

DOJ's response: A denial of knowledge

Maxwell’s controversial move

A personal connection?





James O’Keefe, the founder of Project Veritas and a prominent figure in conservative media, dropped a bombshell on Thursday with the release of a video clip that’s raising eyebrows across the political spectrum.The video features an off-the-record conversation with Joseph Schnitt, an acting deputy chief in the US Department of Justice, in which he discusses the transfer of Ghislaine Maxwell - woman at the heart of Epstein’s dark web - to a minimum-security prison and raises allegations of possible “special treatment” to keep her quiet.The conversation took place in an undercover setting, with a woman questioning Schnitt about his thoughts on the infamous Epstein files and Maxwell’s highly controversial transfer, Mediaite reported.Maxwell, who was convicted of sex trafficking in connection with financier Jeffrey Epstein, has remained a lightning rod for conspiracy theories and political backlash.The video begins with a question about the Epstein files, which have long been shrouded in secrecy. The woman in the clip asks, ""But those files do exist?"" to which Schnitt confirms, saying that ""thousands and thousands"" of pages are involved, with a significant number of them expected to be redacted.But it’s what Schnitt says next that sent shockwaves through both the political and media landscapes.He claims, ""I think they visited that Maxwell person. Kind of also involved… Transferred to a minimum-security prison too recently, which is against BOP policy because she’s a convicted sex offender. They’re offering her something to keep her quiet.""The bombshell comment sent O’Keefe into action, sharing the tape with his audience and explaining that Schnitt’s remarks reveal troubling inconsistencies and raise questions about Maxwell’s treatment by the Department of Justice (DOJ). O'Keefe then doubled down, discussing Schnitt's position as an acting deputy chief within the DOJ and the potential implications of his statements regarding the handling of the Epstein files, reported Mediaite.""That was the acting deputy chief of the Office of Enforcement Operations, Joseph Schnitt, telling a stranger about the FBI and DOJ’s handling of the Epstein files,"" O’Keefe remarked. ""It’s a rare glimpse into how some high-ranking officials might view the situation—and it raises significant concerns about transparency and accountability.""In a statement provided to Project Veritas, the DOJ swiftly responded to the video, asserting that Schnitt had no involvement in the department’s internal review of the Epstein materials. ""Joseph Schnitt has confirmed as much to leadership,"" the statement read, adding that his comments were based solely on ""what he learned in the media"" and were ""not reflective of the DOJ’s review process.""The DOJ continued, clarifying that the remarks Schnitt made about Maxwell’s treatment and the handling of the Epstein files were ""baseless"" and ""had absolutely zero bearing on reality."" They also noted that the department remains committed to transparency and is fully complying with requests for documents from the House Oversight Committee.Despite the DOJ's denial, O’Keefe and his supporters argue that the video sheds light on a potential cover-up, with O’Keefe further alleging that Maxwell’s move from a low-security federal prison in Florida to a minimum-security facility in Texas could be part of a larger effort to suppress crucial information.Maxwell’s recent transfer has already been a source of considerable controversy. She was moved to a federal prison camp in Texas, which is known for offering more lenient conditions compared to high-security facilities.Critics have pointed to the fact that the transfer came shortly after a meeting with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who previously served as President Donald Trump’s personal attorney. This connection has only fueled conspiracy theories, particularly among those who believe that the Trump administration may have been trying to distance itself from the fallout of the Epstein scandal.Following the move, Democrats were quick to accuse the DOJ of witness tampering. In a letter to the department, House Democrats raised alarms, writing, “These actions raise substantial concerns that the Administration may now be attempting to tamper with a crucial witness, conceal President Trump’s relationship with convicted sex offenders, and coax Maxwell into providing false or misleading testimony in order to protect the President. ”Adding another layer of intrigue, the DOJ issued an email purportedly from Schnitt, claiming that he met the woman in the video on a dating app and that he was unaware of Maxwell’s transfer. The email further stated that Schnitt’s remarks about the Epstein files were entirely based on public reports and that he had no personal knowledge of the situation.This new development has led to even more questions, with some critics alleging that the DOJ's response might be an attempt to downplay the significance of Schnitt’s comments.","James O'Keefe, the founder of Project Veritas, released a video clip on Thursday. The clip features an off-the-record conversation with Joseph Schnitt, an acting deputy chief in the US Department of Justice.

NEW DELHI: Security has been tightened across Mumbai after the city’s Traffic Police received a threat message on their official WhatsApp number, claiming that multiple terror attacks were being planned.According to police, the message stated that 34 vehicles in the city had been fitted with “human bombs” and warned that the blasts would “shake entire Mumbai.”As the police make security arrangements for Anant Chaturthi, the 10th day of the Ganesh festival, the traffic police control room on Thursday received a threat message, the official said to news agency PTI.He added that the Crime Branch has launched an investigation into the threat, and the Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) and other agencies have also been informed.The organisation behind the threat identified itself as ‘Lashkar-e-Jihadi’, further claiming that 14 Pakistani terrorists have entered India.The threat also stated that 400 kg of RDX explosives would be used in the attacks.As Mumbai prepares for the grand finale of the 10-day Ganesh festival this Saturday, police have stepped up security to manage the lakhs of devotees expected to crowd the city’s streets.An official said security has been intensified at sensitive locations, with combing operations underway to prevent any untoward incidents.Authorities are also investigating the source of a suspicious message that surfaced during the festival period.Police have appealed to citizens not to fall for rumours and to promptly report any suspicious activity, assuring that all measures are in place for a safe and peaceful celebration.","Security has been tightened across Mumbai after the city’s Traffic Police received a threat message on their official WhatsApp number.

NAGPUR: Notorious Mumbai don-turned-neta Arun Gawli also called ‘Daddy' stepped out of Nagpur Central Prison on Wednesday after Supreme Court granted him bail in the 2007 murder case of Sena corporator Kamlakar Jamsandekar. After serving over 17 years in a high-security cell, including nine-and-half years in Nagpur Central Jail, the 76-year-old gangster shared a poignant wish with a senior jailor to reconnect with his family and play with his grandchildren, a stark contrast to his fearsome reputation in Mumbai's criminal underbelly.Gawli confided to one of the senior prison officials, his voice heavy with regret, that he missed watching his children grow and now wanted to spend time grandchildren. The emotional confession revealed a softer side of a man, who once ruled Dagdi Chawl in Byculla, offering a glimpse into his longing to reclaim a life lost to incarceration.The release was steeped in drama with Nagpur Police and prison guards orchestrating a fortified security to ensure Gawli's safe exit. Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) personnel and various intelligence units were present to pick up concealed clues.Dodging a throng of media waiting at the jail gates, Gawli was whisked away to Nagpur airport under heavy escort, arriving three hours early for his Mumbai-bound flight.Intelligence sources cited ongoing threats from Dawood Ibrahim 's D-Company, a feud rooted in the violent gang wars of the Eighties and Nineties, as the reason for his cautious departure. Surveillance was ramped up with police videographing the scene.Gawli's conviction in 2012 for Jamsandekar's murder, under the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA), marked a significant blow to his empire. Sentenced to life, he challenged the Bombay High Court's 2019 ruling upholding his conviction. On August 28, the Supreme Court granted him bail, citing his age and the 17 years already served, pending his appeal.Inside Nagpur Central Jail, Gawli was a model prisoner, adhering to protocols and earning commendations for discipline. He was granted 14–15 paroles and furloughs without incident. ""We recalled seeing Gawli spending time with religious scriptures,"" said a senior prison official. In 2018, he grabbed headlines by taking an exam on Gandhian philosophy, scoring 74 out of 80 marks, earning a certificate and khadi clothes — a surprising twist for a man synonymous with Mumbai's underworld.Gawli's release sparked speculation about his next move. Once a formidable figure who transitioned from crime to politics, serving as an MLA from Chinchpokli (2004–2009) under his Akhil Bharatiya Sena, Gawli's legacy is a complex tapestry of power, crime, and redemption. As he returns to Mumbai, questions swirl about whether ‘Daddy' will revive his political ambitions or embrace the quiet family life he craves.With security concerns looming, particularly from D-Company, his homecoming is anything but ordinary. Mumbai watches closely as the aging don steps into an uncertain future, balancing personal dreams with a past that refuses to fade.","Arun Gawli, 76, was released from Nagpur Central Prison on Wednesday.

House Speaker Mike Johnson on Friday claimed, in a striking remark, that Donald Trump had served as an FBI “informant” against Jeffrey Epstein — even as the US president dismissed bipartisan efforts to release all federal files on Epstein as a “Democrat hoax.”Johnson, a Republican ally of Trump, said the president had cooperated with federal authorities “for decades,” dating back to Epstein’s association with Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club.“He’s not saying what Epstein did is a hoax — it’s a terrible, unspeakable evil, and he believes that himself. When he first heard the rumour, he kicked him (Epstein) out of Mar-a-Lago. He was an FBI informant trying to take this down,” Johnson told reporters. He added that Trump “has great sympathy for the women who have suffered these unspeakable harms”.The two had discussed the matter “as recently as 24 hours ago”, he further stated.The White House has not commented on Johnson’s assertion.While Johnson sought to defend Trump, the latter has repeatedly dismissed demands for greater transparency in the Epstein case, insisting the push for full disclosure is ""politically motivated.""In Congress, momentum is building for a legislation to declassify the complete Epstein file. Reps. Thomas Massie (Republican; Kentucky.) and Rohit ""Ro"" Khanna (Democrat; California) are leading a bipartisan bill, with Massie also pushing a discharge petition to force a House vote.Massie said on X that 214 lawmakers had signed the petition — just four short of the 218 required. “I’m 99% certain we’ll get 218,” he wrote, warning that Johnson might try to change House rules to block the vote.So far, only three other Republicans — Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert and Nancy Mace — have signed on, CNN reported. Survivors, frustrated by government inaction, have threatened to compile their own list of Epstein’s alleged associates.Massie further suggested that while survivors’ private list may not appear “any time soon,” lawmakers could use congressional immunity to disclose names on the House floor.",Bipartisan push for files on Jeffrey Epstein is building in Congress.

New York City mayor Eric Adams on Friday reaffirmed that he will not step down from his reelection bid, emphasising his commitment to the race amid reports suggesting that he has been approached about a potential role in a future Trump administration.“I am in this race. And I am the only one who can beat Mamdani,"" he said while referring to the democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani “How many times have I been told throughout this journey to step aside, to surrender, to give up, to give in,” he said. “That’s the same thing we tell everyday New Yorkers. Everyday New Yorkers are not giving up, are not giving in, are not surrendering, so their mayor is not going to do that.”Close advisers to US president Donald Trump had been working on a plan to nominate Adams as US ambassador to Saudi Arabia, hoping the move would persuade him to drop his struggling reelection bid, said four people familiar with the talks, as cited by the New York Times.The effort was reportedly pushed by Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff, a Trump aide, who met Adams in Florida this week and spoke with people in the mayor’s circle.The plan, however, appeared to stall by late Friday amid political backlash and growing public criticism of any such deal. Adams held a press conference on Friday afternoon, making it clear that he was not stepping aside.He firmly declared he would stay in the race and dismissed his rivals as “spoiled brats.”“He is free to do what he wants,” Trump said regarding Adams, shortly after the latter made the announcement.The US president went on to comment on the broader race, suggesting that former Governor Andrew Cuomo would have a viable chance against Zohran Mamdani in a direct, one-on-one contest. However, he noted that with multiple challengers in the field, defeating Mamdani would be unlikely.Trump has said previously that he does not want to see Zohran Mamdani, 33, become mayor of the nation’s largest city. He said he would prefer that two of the other leading candidates, former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who, like Adams, is running as an independent, and Republican Curtis Sliwa, step aside to clear the way for a direct, one-on-one race against Mamdani.","New York City mayor Eric Adams reaffirmed that he will not step down from his reelection bid.

He joked that if given a choice, he would move into Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort “just to drive him insane.”Kimmel clarified that his Italian citizenship was unrelated to politics. He said he had been trying to get it for nearly 20 years because of his love for Italy. “Mostly what I like to do is bring my passport to parties and show it to people and make them jealous,” he said with humour.The comedian has often criticised Trump in his monologues. In April, he mocked Trump’s first 100 days in office, saying they were more “prehistoric” than historic.","Kimmel, during his summer break, had appeared on the Sarah Silverman Podcast and mentioned that he had obtained Italian citizenship.

‘Department of war’: Trump signs order renaming defence department; what it means,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/department-of-war-trump-signs-order-renaming-defence-department-what-it-means/articleshow/123728737.cms,"US president Donald Trump (AP photo)

What the renaming means





US president Donald Trump on Friday signed an executive order renaming the Department of Defence as the Department of War.The Department of War was created in 1789 to oversee the Army. It carried the name until president Harry Truman reorganised the military in 1947, merging the Army, Navy and newly created Air Force under the Department of Defence.Trump said the change was meant to reflect American military toughness. “It’s a much more appropriate name, especially in light of where the world is right now,” he said. He argued that the Defence title was “woke” and insisted, “We decided to go woke and change the name to Department of Defence. So we’re going Department of War.”Trump earlier argued that the War title “just sounded better,” telling reporters in August, “Everybody likes that we had an unbelievable history of victory when it was Department of War. Then we changed it to Department of Defense.""Trump cannot legally bring back the old name on his own, as only Congress can make that change. His executive order, signed on Friday, does not make it official.Instead, the White House said the “Department of War” will be used only as a secondary title for the agency, writes Forbes. Defence secretary Pete Hegseth will also be able to identify himself as “secretary of war” in official documents and ceremonies.The order also tells Hegseth to propose steps needed to permanently change the Department of Defense’s name to the Department of War.The renaming marks a symbolic shift, reflecting Trump and Hegseth’s push to roll back what they call “woke” policies in the military. It also ties back to earlier efforts to restore names of bases once linked to Confederate leaders, which had been renamed under a 2023 law.The move does not change the structure or powers of the Pentagon, but it revives a historic label first introduced under George Washington in 1789 and retired after World War II.At the announcement, defence secretary Pete Hegseth supported the move, saying: “We haven’t won a major war since the name change. We’re going to go on offence, not just on defence.”Democrats sharply criticised Trump’s move to rename the Department of Defence, arguing that it glorifies “war” while doing little for troops. They called it a costly and performative step instead of a real investment in service members.Senator Tammy Duckworth, a military veteran, told Reuters: “Why not spend this money on military families or on diplomats who help prevent wars? Trump would rather use the military for political points than strengthen national security or support our servicemembers.”","Department of War was created in 1789 to oversee the Army.

From ‘Lost India To China’ To PM Modi's Praise: Donald Trump Rushes Into Damage Control Mode





: Slipping into damage control mode after he and his lieutenants singed ties with India with incendiary remarks, US President Donald Trump on Friday said US and India have a special relationship and there is ""nothing to worry about. ""Hours after his ""Truth Social"" post saying he had lost India and Russia to China, Trump did an about turn in a White House chat with media, asserting, “I don’t think we have (lost India). I’m disappointed that India is buying Russian oil and I’ve let them know with very big tariff...50% tariff.""""I will always be friends with Modi... he is a great Prime Minister, ... I just don't like what he is doing at this particular moment, but India and the United States have a special relationship. There is nothing to worry about,"" Trump said, when asked by ANI if he is ready to reset the relationship.The remarks came after New Delhi bluntly rejected US demand that it stop buying Russian oil, with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman defiantly saying, “Where we buy our oil from, especially a big-ticket foreign exchange item...we will have to take a call on what suits us best.”“We will undoubtedly be buying (Russian oil),” she told CNN-IBM.Separately, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal adopted a more conciliatory tone, saying the trade row was just a temporary wrinkle in an otherwise consequential relationship that will not be easily derailed.That message came after US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick publicly laid out a laundry list of US demands from India, including not buying Russian oil and pulling out of BRICS and predicted that India would make a trade deal with Trump within two months after saying sorry.Separately, White House trade counselor Peter Navarro, Lutnick's comrade-in-incendiary rhetoric, reacted to a Washington Post story about the damage he is doing to the relationship, saying ""India can't handle truth/spins @washpo Leftist American fake news."" Navarro has accused India of being ""Kremlin's laundromat"" and characterized the Russia-Ukraine war as ""Modi's war"" among other offensive comments.Ridiculed even in the US for faking quotes for his book, Navarro and his MAGA cohorts are now canvassing for tariffing foreign remote workers, including outsourcing to India, action that would tip the relationship into uncharted territory.Trump's latest on Modi: I get along very well with Modi. In fact, we went to the Rose Garden and the grass was so soaking wet. It was such a terrible place to have a news conference. I said, well, let's use a beautiful white stone, emblematic of the White House, and it's been very well received. But we had a news conference on the grass. It was my last news conference I had on the grass because everybody sunk in. You probably sunk in. Every reporter out there, they ruined their shoes.","US President Donald Trump on Friday said US and India have a special relationship and there is ""nothing to worry about"" The remarks came after New Delhi bluntly rejected US demand that it stop buying Russian oil, with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman defiantly saying, “We will have to take a call on what suits us best”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123728680,imgsize-929805,width-400,resizemode-4/donald-trump-and-pm-modi-file-photos.jpg"
'A little bit of lead': Donald Trump says Zohran Mamdani likely to be next mayor; denies meddling,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/a-little-bit-of-lead-donald-trump-says-zohran-mamdani-likely-to-be-next-mayor-denies-meddling/articleshow/123709530.cms,"'Trump A Threat To New York': Zohran Mamdani Challenges U.S. President On Takeover By National Guard





US President Donald Trump on Thursday said that Democrat Zohran Mamdani is likely to become New York City's next mayor unless two of his three major rivals drop out. However, the Republican leader declined to name which candidates he thought should quit.Speaking at a White House dinner with tech executives, Trump denied urging anyone to exit the race but suggested the crowded field benefits Mamdani. ""I don't think you can win unless you have one-on-one, and somehow he's gotten a little bit of a lead,"" Trump said. ""I would like to see two people drop out and have it be one-on-one, and I think that's a race that could be won.""Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist, became the presumptive frontrunner after defeating former governor Andrew Cuomo in June's Democratic primary. But both Cuomo and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams remain on the ballot as independents, joined by Republican Curtis Sliwa, founder of the Guardian Angels.Behind the scenes, Trump allies have floated scenarios for narrowing the race. Intermediaries recently reached out to Adams' circle about the possibility of him dropping his campaign for a federal role, according to people familiar with the talks, AP reported. Adams, indicted last year on corruption charges before prosecutors dropped the case, has said he will not leave the race.""No pressure, no diamonds,"" Adams said Thursday.Cuomo has openly called for Adams to quit, arguing that Mamdani poses ""an existential threat"" to Democrats. Sliwa, meanwhile, rejected speculation that Adams' voters would automatically migrate to Cuomo and insisted he is staying in the race. ""I can assure you for the 9,852th time: I'm not dropping out. I'm in it until November 4,"" Sliwa said.Meanwhile, Mamdani threw down a challenge to Trump, daring him to face off in a televised debate. This came after Cuomo urged him to take part in five debates, one in each borough.""Let's cut out the middle man,"" Mamdani told The New York Post. ""Why should I debate Donald Trump's puppet when I could debate Donald Trump himself?""""If Donald Trump is serious about intervening in the mayoral race, he should come to New York City and debate me directly about why he's cutting SNAP benefits for hungry New Yorkers to give tax breaks to his wealthy donors,"" Mamdani told New York Post.","US President Donald Trump says Democrat Zohran Mamdani is likely to become New York City's next mayor unless two of his three major rivals drop out.

The White House on Thursday announced that US President Donald Trump is renaming the department of defence to ""department of war,"" fulfilling his long-standing wish of rebranding it to project a more powerful image.White House, in an official statement, said that Trump will sign an executive order permitting use of the ""department of war"" as a ""secondary title"" for the sprawling department, as Congress establishes its official title.According to Fox News, the move to formally restore the Pentagon's historic name, directing the department of Defence to be once again called the department of war is part of the administration's ""warrior ethos"" campaign.It will make ""department of war"" a secondary title for the agency, with defence secretary Pete Hegseth adopting the title ""secretary of war."" A White House fact sheet says the order also instructs Hegseth to propose legislative and executive steps to make the change permanent.The rebranding will extend beyond titles. A White House official said Pentagon websites and signage will be updated, including renaming the public affairs briefing room the ""Pentagon War Annex.""Longer-term changes are being planned.Trump has teased the shift in recent days, telling reporters on August 25, ""Everybody likes that we had an unbelievable history of victory when it was department of war. Then we changed it to department of defense.""Hegseth, who has already been introduced by Trump as ""secretary of war,"" echoed the president's reasoning, calling the new name symbolic of a cultural shift. ""We won WWI and WWII not with the department of defense, but with a war department,"" he said Wednesday on Fox & Friends. ""We're not just defence, we're offence.
