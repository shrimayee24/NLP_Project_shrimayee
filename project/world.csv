Goa: 23 Killed In Arpora Nightclub Fire; Cylinder Blast Suspected, CM Sawant Vows Strict Action

NEW DELHI: A weekend party night in North Goa turned into a tragedy after a massive fire tore through a nightclub in Arpora, killing at least 25 people and injuring many more late Saturday. Eyewitnesses said the blaze followed a ""big fire"" triggered by a ""massive explosion,"" in one of Goa's busiest nightlife belts.Local authorities later confirmed that the club structure itself had no valid permissions. A panchayat official from Arpora said the establishment’s construction “was there without permission,” raising serious questions about regulatory oversight.Several visitors described how close they came to being inside when the inferno erupted. Avanish from Delhi, who had planned to visit the restaurant, said, “…Actually, we got lucky because our cab driver was late or else we would be here…”A security guard at a nearby restaurant recalled the moment the blast shook the area: “...We heard a massive explosion. We later learned that the fire broke out after a cylinder blast…”Nikhnesh, also from Delhi, said he arrived just as smoke began rising. “As soon as we reached our hostel, we saw plumes of smoke rising… Actually, we were planning to come and party here last night… I think there was DJ party yesterday, I don’t know much about it.”Witnesses reported that between 100 and 150 people were on the dance floor when the fire broke out. In the panic, several people rushed downstairs into the kitchen area, where they were trapped along with staff members. Most of the victims, authorities said, were kitchen workers; among the dead were three women and several tourists.Sanjay Kumar Gupta, a security guard at Birch, said the tragedy unfolded within minutes. “The incident occurred between 11 pm and 12 am. Suddenly, there was a fire... I was at the gate… A DJ, dancer was going to come here, and it was about to get really crowded…”Fatima Shaikh, a tourist from Hyderabad, said the nightclub was packed for the weekend. “There was a sudden commotion as the flames started erupting… We rushed out of the club only to see that the entire structure was up in flames,” she said. Many who fled ran into the kitchen, not knowing it was a dead end. “They (tourists) got trapped there along with other staff… Many managed to run out of the club,” she added.The fire spread rapidly, aided by temporary décor made of palm leaves. Access for fire tenders was severely hindered: the club sits along the Arpora backwaters, reachable only through narrow lanes. Tankers had to be parked almost 400 metres away, slowing the response. A senior Fire and Emergency Services officer said the lack of access “made controlling the blaze a challenging task.” Most deaths occurred due to suffocation.Chief minister Pramod Sawant , who visited the site, said the club had not complied with fire safety norms. He announced an inquiry and assured strict action. “The nightclub had not followed the fire safety norms,” he said, adding that both the management and officials who allowed it to run would face consequences.Arpora-Nagoa panchayat sarpanch Roshan Redkar said the club was operated by Saurav Luthra, who was embroiled in a dispute with his partner. “We had inspected the premises and found that they did not have the permission to construct the club,” he said. A demolition notice had been issued earlier, but officials from the directorate of panchayats granted a stay.“The fire incident that happened was unfortunate… Now, we have to be more vigilant,” Redkar added.Calangute MLA Michael Lobo, who also reached the site, said all nightclubs in the area will face a fire safety audit starting Monday. He said notices would be issued seeking valid permissions, and “the licenses of clubs not having the necessary permissions will be cancelled.”","A massive fire tore through a nightclub in North Goa, killing at least 25 people.

Sheikh Hasina, UK MP Tulip Siddiq Convicted in Corruption Case, Raising Concerns Over Fair Trials

Why wasn’t Sweety, deported with Sunali, brought back: Kin

KOLKATA: Tears of relief flowed in one mud-walled home in Bengal’s Birbhum district. A kilometre away, another house filled with the same prayers stayed silent.On Saturday, Sunali Khatun returned to Paikar village with her son Shabir, 8, after months of detention in Bangladesh. Her return, ordered on humanitarian grounds because of her advanced pregnancy, has only sharpened the anguish of another Birbhum family still waiting for their daughter, Sweety Bibi, and her two sons to come back.Sweety’s third child Imran, who lives with his grandparents, keeps asking why his aunt has returned but not his mother. “How do you explain this to a 10-year-old?” said Sweety’s mother Rozina Bibi, 50. “They took my mother,” Imran said. “When will they return her to me?”The family’s struggle runs deeper. Sweety has been the sole earner since her husband Azizul Dewan went missing in TN four years ago. Working as a house help in Delhi, she supported her three sons and her ailing parents. “We cry every time we meet,” Rozina said of Sunali’s parents Bhodu and Jyotsna. “Today their daughter is back. We are happy for them. But why not mine?”Sunali, her husband Danish Sheikh, their son, and her cousin Sweety, 32, along with Sweety’s two sons — Kurban, 16, and Imam, 6 — were picked up in June during a crackdown on “illegal immigrants” in New Delhi. They were flown to Guwahati and pushed across the border under an order of Delhi’s Foreigners Regional Registration Office. Bangladesh authorities arrested them on Aug 21. A Chapai Nawabganj court later granted them bail.A Calcutta high court division bench had quashed the deportation order, citing procedural lapses, and directed that all six be brought home. That judgment was challenged before the Supreme Court, where a two-judge bench asked the Centre on Dec 3 to bring back Sunali and her son and keep her under hospital care.“If the HC ordered all six to be brought back, why was my daughter stopped?” asked Rozina. “They told us she reached the border, then said it would take two or three more days. We have been hearing this since Sept 26.”Bengal migrant workers’ welfare board chairperson Samirul Islam said Supreme Court will hear Sweety’s case again on Dec 12. “We are hopeful that Sweety and her two minor children, and Sunali’s husband, will be allowed to return too,” he said. Until then, one Birbhum household rocks a pregnant daughter back into safety. Another counts the footsteps that still haven’t crossed the border.","Sunali Khatun returned to Paikar village with her son Shabir, 8, after months of detention in Bangladesh.

BJP hits back

.

(with inputs from PTI)

NEW DELHI: Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah on Saturday said that the opposition INDIA alliance is currently “on life support”. He said that internal infighting is weakening its ability to challenge the BJP Speaking at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit in New Delhi, Abdullah said the opposition bloc is struggling to function as a united force against the ruling party’s strong election machinery.“We’re sort of on life support, but every once in a while somebody brings out his paddles and gives us a bit of a shock and we get up again. But then results like Bihar happen, and we slump down again, and then somebody has to wheel us into the ICU,” the National Conference leader said.Referring to the recent election results in Bihar, where the INDIA alliance suffered a massive defeat against the NDA, he blamed the opposition bloc for driving Nitish Kumar back into the ruling alliance.“I believe that we pushed Nitish Kumar back into the arms of the NDA,” he said.He also pointed to organisational failures within the INDIA bloc, including the decision to exclude the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) from the Bihar seat-sharing arrangement, despite the party's presence in the state.According to Abdullah, the alliance has failed to take cohesive and strategic decisions.He said the BJP begins preparing for the next election almost immediately after one ends, while the opposition often starts its preparations only months before polls, sometimes finalising alliances just before the last date for filing nominations.When asked if the outcome of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections was a fluke, Abdullah rejected the suggestion. “No, I think the country sent a message to the Central government and to Prime Minister Modi in 2024 that things are not as rosy as they were made out to be,” he said.He also said that after the 2024 elections, the Centre showed that it can work in an alliance format. “From calling it a BJP government, they called themselves an NDA government. These are small changes, but they matter,” Abdullah said. He added that the government’s style of functioning has become more consultative.BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla, reacting to Abdullah’s remarks said that he had “shown a mirror” to the INDIA alliance.In a post on X, Poonawalla wrote: “Omar Abdullah shows a mirror to INDI.”He added that the INDI alliance, led by the Congress, pushed Nitish Kumar out, gave an “unfair deal” to the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha in Bihar.""INDI alliance ( read Congress ) pushed out Nitish Kumar ji. INDI alliance gave unfair deal to JMM in Bihar so if they leave don’t be surprised,"" his post read.Poonawalla further said that the NDA is a “Majboot alliance” with a clear mission and Prime Minister Narendra Modi as its leader and called Congress a “Majboor alliance of ambition and corruption”.""NDA is Majboot alliance full of mission & vision with Modi ji as leader. Indi is Majboor alliance of ambition and corruption with Rahul Baba at helm,"" he wrote.Poonawalla also said that Abdullah’s party has earlier taken positions different from other INDIA bloc partners, including on issues related to alleged “vote chori”.",Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah said that the opposition INDIA alliance is currently “on life support” He said that internal infighting is weakening its ability to challenge the BJP.

"After 10-yr chase, wildlife sleuths nab the ‘ghost’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-10-yr-chase-wildlife-sleuths-nab-the-ghost/articleshow/125795175.cms,"Woman Behind Massive Trafficking Network Finally Runs Out Of Luck In Snowbound Village On China Border

BHOPAL: In the snowbound silence of Lachung, in north Sikkim, 43-year-old wildlife trafficker Yangchen Lachungpa, wanted by Interpol, finally ran out of mountains.For 10 years, agencies across India and abroad had hunted for Yangchen — a woman who, investigators said, moved like a ghost, slipping across borders, abandoning safe houses hours ahead of raids, and allegedly built trafficking corridors that linked Madhya Pradesh’s tiger reserves to Nepal, Tibet and China.But on Dec 2, in a tiny Himalayan village just a few km from the India-China border, the chase ended in a way even veteran officers described as “like watching a film play out in real time”.As radios died and torches dimmed in the freezing darkness, the MP State Tiger Strike Force (STSF) and Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) team found itself under jurisdiction of the Dzumsa, Lachung’s centuries-old self-governing council. Villagers reportedly blocked the only exit, and elected headmen demanded documents. And the officers — carrying warrants for one of the world’s most elusive wildlife traffickers — were forced to defend every procedural step before being allowed to detain Yangchen.At the centre of this standoff sat the woman they had chased for a decade — Yangchen Lachungpa, also the former wife of 44-year-old Jaiy Tamang, arrested from Delhi for his alleged role in smuggling pangolin scales.Tamang’s confession years earlier had first exposed Yangchen as a critical architect of the smuggling chain.Officers said Yangchen allegedly tried to destroy two cellphones and a coded diary containing names, routes and hawala references before the arrest could be completed. “It was part standoff, part village trial, part global crime bust. We had an Interpol fugitive sitting in front of us, but first, we had to convince a 400-year-old council that Indian law applied,” said an investigator.Her eventual arrest came only after months of technical surveillance, decoy movements and night-time encirclements across high-altitude terrain. The operation was monitored closely by Madhya Pradesh govt, officials said, given the seriousness of the tiger-poaching case.Yangchen’s arrest marks one of India’s most significant breakthroughs in wildlife enforcement — and one of the rare arrests executed following an Interpol Red Notice, issued on Oct 2, 2025, at India’s request. It allowed law enforcement in 195 countries to detain her if found.Originally from Tibet, Yangchen allegedly built trafficking corridors that funnelled tiger parts, pangolin scales, red sanders, shatoosh wool and Cordyceps to international buyers. She frequently moved between Delhi and remote Sikkim hideouts, often vanishing just before surveillance teams closed in.The role of this syndicate surfaced repeatedly in international seizures. In 2013, Nepal Police intercepted five tiger skins and seven sacks of bones en route to Tibet; DNA testing later matched one hide to Pench tigress T-13. In 2015, Ethiopian authorities confiscated eight tiger skins believed to have originated in central India. Both cases, investigators said, bore the hallmark of the alleged network Yangchen helped create.The case that finally cornered her began in July 2015, when MP authorities seized tiger bones, skin, pangolin scales and bone oil extract from Satpura Tiger Reserve. STSF uncovered what officials called a “highly structured multinational trafficking chain.” As many as 31 accused were arrested, and 27 were convicted by a Narmadapuram court in 2022. But Yangchen, the woman believed to be the missing link — the one connecting village-level poachers to buyers beyond the Himalayas — remained out of reach.She was arrested once in Sept 2017, but went on the run after obtaining interim bail. In 2019, her anticipatory bail was rejected, and she disappeared again, prompting authorities to seek international intervention.After her arrest in Lachung, Yangchen was transported to Gangtok for medical examination and produced in court on Dec 3, where MP authorities secured transit remand. Sikkim Police provided vital support in what officers called “one of the most culturally delicate and operationally dangerous extractions in recent memory”.Payments in the network were allegedly routed through Kathmandu, Siliguri and border villages, while suspected wildlife stockpiles were maintained in Satpura, Pench, Betul and Tamia forests. The coded diary recovered in the raid is expected to reveal financial backers, international contacts and the deeper structure of the trafficking chain.A senior enforcement officer said the breakthrough “finally gives sleuths a chance to expose the top tier of global wildlife contraband markets”, adding that more arrests across states — and potentially across borders — are likely.","Yangchen Lachungpa, 43, wanted by Interpol, finally ran out of mountains.

Rajnath Singh Claims Nehru Wanted Babri Built With Public Funds But Sardar Patel Blocked His Plan

KOLKATA/BEHRAMPORE: Calcutta HC directed the Bengal govt Friday to do whatever it takes to pre-empt communal disturbance in Murshidabad’s Beldanga ahead of suspended TMC MLA Humayun Kabir ’s planned foundation-laying ceremony for a “Babri Masjid”, coinciding with the Dec 6 anniversary of the Ayodhya structure’s 1992 demolition.“The state must act per its stand... The law-and-order situation in Murshidabad shall be strictly maintained, and the lives and properties of citizens will be protected,” the division bench of acting Chief Justice Sujoy Paul and Justice Partha Sarathi Sen said while disposing of a PIL against the scheduled event.Kabir’s mosque plan comes barely eight months after communal violence in Murshidabad, triggered by protests against the Wakf (Amendment) Act, 2025.Advocate-general Kishore Datta told the bench the state had already deployed adequate forces to thwart any plan to disturb peace. Deputy solicitor-general Rajdeep Majumdar said 19 companies of CISF were stationed in the area. A 3,500-strong security contingent, including RAF units, fanned out into Rejinagar and its surrounding areas on the eve of the event. Two BSF companies are on standby to secure NH-12.MLA Kabir, suspended by TMC a day ago, was summoned to Rejinagar police station Friday evening and questioned for several hours, sources said.Earlier in the day, a defiant Kabir supervised arrangements for Saturday’s event and asked his team to arrange 30,000 packets of biryani for his guests. He met splinter groups of Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind and All Bengal Imam Muezzin Association.“The main programme will start at noon. The Quran will be read for two hours. There will be no speeches, no political representation, no party flags, and no political canards. I will be there with 2,000 volunteers. Everyone knows... this isn’t a new thing,” he told reporters.TMC spokesman Kunal Ghosh alleged a conspiracy hatched by TMC’s main rival to discredit the party as the state heads into an election year.(With inputs from PTI)",Calcutta HC directs Bengal govt to do whatever it takes to pre-empt communal disturbance in Murshidabad.

NEW DELHI: While continuing its defiance of orders from Madras HC allowing lighting of the ‘ Karthigai Deepam ’ atop Thiruparankundram hills, Tamil Nadu’s DMK govt on Friday requested Supreme Court for an early hearing on its appeal but got no such assurance from CJI Surya Kant.When a counsel mentioned TN’s appeal before a bench of CJI Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi, referring it to as an issue of “lighting of a lamp on a hilltop” and urging for an urgent hearing, the CJI said he would consider its listing as soon as possible. The state govt defended its action of not complying with the HC orders allowing the traditional lighting of ‘deepam’ at the stone lamp pillar on the Thirupparankundram hillock near Madurai on the ground that legally it had exclusive rights over rituals and customs of Uchi Pillayar temple.HC had allowed the ‘deepam’, saying it would not encroach the rights of the adjacent dargah. The order passed by a single-judge bench was upheld by a division bench.Appearing for a caveator, advocate P V Yogeswaran said that on the one hand, TN is repeatedly defying the HC’s orders, and on the other, it is “creating a drama” by filing an appeal in SC to dissuade HC from proceeding with the contempt proceedings initiated against authorities for blatant, brazen and deliberate defiance of HC’s orders.In its appeal in SC, the MK Stalin-led DMK govt said HC cannot use its “contempt jurisdiction” to question temple rituals and customs, which are within the exclusive domain of authorities under TN Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment Act, 1959.The single-judge bench on Wednesday initiated contempt proceedings against officials after the ‘deepam’ was lit at the temple, not at the ‘deepathoon’ atop the hill, as directed by it on Dec 1. TN’s appeal against this order was dismissed by the division bench.The DMK govt in its appeal in SC said the temple’s management, including the area under ‘deepathoon’ was under its exclusive control, and that it had passed prohibitory orders to ensure safety of citizens and take care of possible law and order situations. “The impugned judgment (of HC) raises important questions regarding the limits of contempt jurisdiction, the autonomy of temple management under statutory schemes, the effect of prior civil decrees and writ precedents, and the interface between judicial orders and executive law and order measures,” it said.The appeal detailed the tussle between HC and authorities. HC’s single-judge bench at 6.05pm on Dec 3 ordered authorities to allow the petitioner to go to the hilltop to light the lamp, and around the same time, the district collector issued prohibitory orders under Section 163 of the BNSS (Section 144 of CrPC) prohibiting persons from climbing the hillock to prevent a law and order situation.The division bench, while dismissing the state’s appeal, had said the executive orders under Section 162 of the BNSS cannot override judicial directions, and noted apparent manipulation/timing of prohibitory orders. It said the appeal was a “well-designed act” to pre-empt contempt. It said the single-judge would decide whether the non-compliance of its orders was wilful.",Madras HC had allowed lighting of the ‘ Karthigai Deepam ’ atop Thiruparankundram hills.

Prosecution failed to prove girl was under age of 18: Judge

MUMBAI: After spending eight years in jail on charges of sexually assaulting a 17-year-old intellectually disabled girl, a 56-year-old driver was recently acquitted by a special Pocso court.The prosecution failed to prove the “basic foundational facts” of the case, highlighting major inconsistencies regarding the girl’s age, her mental capacity, and a significant contradiction between her statements and the medical report. “To my mind, evidence adduced by the prosecution is scanty and not sufficient to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. If it were so, to my mind, the accused is entitled to get the benefit of doubt,” Special Judge ND Khose said.Advocates Kalam Shaikh and Vaishali Sawant, who defended the accused, submitted that he was falsely implicated due to a past conflict between the girl’s family and him.“No documentary evidence is placed on record showing that the victim is abnormal. Medical evidence is also not supporting the case of the prosecution,” the advocates submitted.The FIR was lodged on Aug 24, 2017. The prosecution alleged that the incident occurred on Aug 23, 2017, between 8 pm and 8.30pm in a slum area.The mother of the girl claimed that while she was at the market and her sons were out, the accused, a neighbour, entered their house. The girl, allegedly a child of 17 years with “less understanding”, later told her mother that the accused had kissed her and established physical relations.The judge noted that the prosecution failed to provide “clinching, believable and authentic documentary evidence” to prove she was under 18. “To my mind, the (birth) certificate… cannot be said to be useful to the prosecution for several reasons... Not only that, from the certificate… it reveals that the names of the father and mother of the girl are not mentioned as mentioned in a report... As such, to my mind, it can be said that no plausible documentary evidence is placed on record by the prosecution to prove the exact age of the girl on the alleged date of the incident. ”The judge said while the FIR suggested the year of birth was 2000, the school certificate indicated 2002. While the prosecution attempted to prove the girl had an IQ of 36, the judge found this claim unproven.","Prosecution failed to prove girl was under age of 18: Judge ND Khose.

MEERUT: Stressing that ""no home can be demolished without due process"", a division bench of justices Ajit Kumar and Satyavir Singh of Allahabad HC stayed the demolition of 27 houses in Bareilly's Shahabad area in Prem Nagar, directing the civic authorities not to take any coercive action ""until the competent authority passes a final order. ""The bench disposed of the writ with clear directions -- ""Each petitioner must file an individual reply within four weeks, and the competent authority (civic body) must decide the matter within two months by issuing a reasoned, speaking order after granting a personal hearing.

"" A copy of the order has been accessed by TOI.The case reached court after residents received notices on Oct 9, declaring their homes ""illegal"" and ordering them to raze their structures within 15 days. The petitioners argued Bareilly Municipal Corporation (BMC) collected taxes for years, contradicting its own claim on its legality.Although the HC issued its stay order on Nov 13, BMC officials said the order took some time to reach them via official channels.""We were aware of it, but the formal copy takes time and hence no action took place,"" municipal commissioner Sanjeev Kumar Maurya told TOI on Saturday. The petitioners received the order on Dec 2, and the residents thereafter rushed with their requests to the civic authority to halt the exercise.In Oct, BMC issued notices to the residents stating that the 27 homes were built illegally on municipal land and warned them that FIRs and recovery of demolition costs may follow. The action came in the backdrop of Sept 26 violence near Islamia Grounds during protests over the 'I Love Muhammad' row, after which authorities launched crackdowns on alleged illegal structures and violations linked to local cleric Tauqeer Raza and his aides.","Allahabad HC stays demolition of 27 houses in Bareilly's Shahabad area in Prem Nagar.

'Maligning Hindu Way Of Life': PM Modi Calls Out Colonial Mindset Over 'Hindu Rate Of Growth' Label

SRINAGAR: A political face-off erupted Saturday over age relaxation for J&K’s civil services exam, with chief minister Omar Abdullah accusing LG Manoj Sinha of stalling a crucial file and the latter’s office firing back that “misleading” claims are being spread as the Dec 7 test looms.Abdullah said that uncertainty has gripped aspirants because of “Lok Bhavan’s delay in approving age relaxation, a provision granted multiple times in the past”, and urged J&K Public Service Commission (JKPSC) to postpone the combined competitive (preliminary) exam. He also cited travel chaos caused by ongoing airline disruptions.The row comes amid student protests seeking an increase in the age limit. J&K currently caps the age at 32 for open-category candidates and 37 for reserved categories. Aspirants said other states such as Uttarakhand and Haryana allow candidates up to 42 years, while UP, MP and Rajasthan set the limit at 40.With five days left for the exam, thousands of candidates remain caught between a stalled decision and the risk of missing what many call a once-in-a-year chance.The LG’s office said it received the age relaxation file on Dec 2 and returned it the same day with a query on whether it was “logistically possible” to alter eligibility criteria so close to the exam.“Despite lapse of four days Lok Bhavan did not receive any response. I fully sympathise with young aspirants,” the statement said, adding that social media posts on the issue were “misleading”.The LG’s office also underlined that JKPSC had published the exam advertisement on Aug 22 and notified Dec 7 as the exam date on Oct 6.NC spokesperson Tanvir Sadiq had earlier claimed the CM had already approved the age relaxation proposal and forwarded it to the LG on Dec 2. After the LG’s statement, Sadiq said there was “absolutely no reason for any further queries” if the file had already been cleared by the CM.Parties trained fire on both sides. “JKAS age relaxation issue is turning out yet another classical case of passing the buck at the cost of young aspirants,” Peoples Conference chief Sajad Lone said. Congress urged both LG and CM to resolve the standoff without further delay, while PDP president Mehbooba Mufti called it “passing of responsibility”.",The row comes amid student protests seeking an increase in the age limit.

Top Bengaluru Jail Official Transferred, 2 Suspended After Viral Videos Spark Outrage

BENGALURU: City police arrested a warder with Bengaluru Central Prison on charges of attempting to smuggle cigarettes and a saturated absorbent paper — suspected to be used for packing drugs — into the barracks Friday night.A prison warder (or Prison officer/guard) is a law enforcement professional responsible for the custody, supervision, safety, and discipline of inmates within a correctional facility. The arrested warder is Rahul Patil, who worked as a warder in different prisons since 2018. He was transferred to Bengaluru Central Prison from Belagavi this June.Police said Patil came to his night shift around 6.50pm, and during the frisking by Karnataka State Industrial Security Force personnel at the entrance, the banned substances were found in his undergarment. Two packs of cigarettes (10 each in a pack) and 60 grams of saturated absorbent paper were found.""Immediately, the matter was brought to the notice of the senior prison officials, and a case against Patil was registered at Parappana Agrahara police station. He was arrested immediately,"" a senior police officer said.For a week, prison officials strictly banned the sale of cigarettes and beedis, which were earlier sold at the prison canteen.Though the prison manual prohibits their sales, prison officials, on humanitarian grounds, were selling them to inmates. A group of inmates protested against the ban, demanding the resumption of sales.Patil is the second warder to be caught smuggling banned substances into the prison in three months. In Oct, warder Amar Praje was allegedly caught while trying to enter the prison with a mobile phone by hoodwinking the security personnel. Based on suspicion, he was stopped and frisked, revealing a mobile phone concealed in his undergarment.","Rahul Patil is the second warder to be caught smuggling banned substances into the prison in three months.

2km in 2 hours: Why traffic was tied into knots on Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/2km-in-2-hours-traffic-tangle-on-gurgaon-delhi-expressway-as-couples-tie-the-knot/articleshow/125795315.cms,"GURGAON: IndiGo fliers weren't the only ones stranded in airports across the country through Thursday. Commuters on Gurgaon-Delhi Expressway weren't any better off.A flurry of weddings in hotels and farmhouses off the expressway had turned the arterial stretch into a virtual parking lot, bringing traffic to a grinding halt. So severe was the snarl that it took commuters nearly two hours to traverse just 2km from the Ambience Mall-Sirhaul border to Rajokri in Delhi — an ordeal that rivalled the plight of air travellers stuck in terminals.The gridlock began around midnight as cars of wedding guests around a popular star hotel spilled onto service roads, blocking the main carriageway. With not a single traffic cop in sight — on either the Gurgaon or Delhi side — frustration mounted among those trapped in the jam.The situation was baffling given the capital's heightened security, just hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin had landed at IGI Airport for a high-profile visit.Calls to the traffic helpline proved futile for many.""I left my office in Udyog Vihar at 9.45pm and the moment I turned onto the expressway, I saw a huge traffic on the Shankar Chowk flyover as well as surface road. While snarls in the city are not entirely new, such tailback at that hour was definitely unusual.There was bumper-to-bumper traffic. It moved at a snail's pace till the toll plaza, but literally came to a standstill after that. While there was some movement on the Rajokri flyover, commuters using the service lane towards Delhi were stranded at the same spot for long. They had no option but to switch off their engines and wait inside. Some simply moved out of their cars and started walking,"" recalled a commuter.The sense of helplessness was palpable. ""Since there was not a single cop around, I dialled 112 multiple times. But the calls either went unanswered or simply did not connect. It took me almost 10 attempts to get through to the control room. After waiting for several minutes, a cop on the other side told me the traffic jam was due to a wedding at a luxury hotel nearby. Guests at the wedding had parked their vehicles on the main highway. It was complete chaos from the Delhi-Gurgaon border till this hotel, even around midnight,"" the commuter added.Police eventually promised action. ""We will tow away the cars that are parked outside this hotel and impound them,"" a police officer assured the commuter.However, the hotel in question — The Umaro — denied responsibility. ""There were several weddings that took place on Thursday night in the vicinity. These cars belonged to guests from other venues,"" a hotel official told TOI.The chaos was not confined to Thursday night. On Friday too, the expressway continued to crawl, with traffic moving at a glacial pace well into the night. Traffic officials in the city attributed the congestion to ongoing work by NHAI on the Delhi side.Satyapal Yadav, ACP (traffic, highways) in Gurgaon, said, ""The snarls on Friday were mainly due to some ongoing work of NHAI on the Delhi side of the expressway. We received many calls from commuters, following which our senior officers were on their toes to clear the traffic. We even contacted the Dwarka traffic inspector and NHAI officials and requested them to not continue the work during peak traffic hours.""The knock-on effects were felt within the city as well. ""I was coming back from Delhi and found a traffic pileup near Udyog Vihar. This was mainly due to a change in the flow of traffic at multiple locations within this office hub,"" said Abhinav Sharma, an IT professional.Delhi traffic officials pointed to the sheer volume of vehicles and the ripple effect of even minor disruptions. ""Often, it's obstructions like vehicle breakdowns that choke the stretch. Our teams are on the ground through the day and have been managing congestion manually at times. This is especially on internal roads near farmhouses, where weddings are scheduled,"" an official said.",A flurry of weddings in hotels and farmhouses off the expressway had turned the arterial stretch into a virtual parking lot.

San Diego to pay $30 million to family of Black teen shot in the back by police officer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/san-diego-to-pay-30-million-to-family-of-black-teen-shot-in-the-back-by-police-officer/articleshow/125802259.cms,"



The city of San Diego agreed to pay $30 million to the family of 16-year-old Konoa Wilson, who was fatally shot in the back by a police officer as he ran away from a shooting at Santa Fe station.The payout resolves a wrongful death lawsuit filed in June by Wilson’s family against the city, which claimed the officer acted with “racial violence”. The agreement was made as a business decision and not an admission of liability, according to city documents obtained by CBS 8.The settlement is among the largest in response to a police shooting in the United States. In 2021, the city of Minneapolis agreed to a $27million civil settlement for George Floyd’s family after he was killed when an officer kneeled on his neck for nine minutes. Floyd said he could not breathe during the May 2020 arrest, Guardian reported.On 28 January, Wilson was standing at the Santa Fe station when another teenager approached him with a gun and began shooting. Wilson ran away, passing by officer Daniel Gold in a corridor. Body-worn camera and surveillance footage released by police showed Gold pulling out his gun and shooting at Wilson’s back within seconds. Gold identified himself as a police officer only after opening fire.Wilson was pronounced dead at hospital 35 minutes later. Although officers found a firearm on Wilson while providing first aid, the civil lawsuit says he neither brandished a weapon nor threatened Gold at the time of the shooting. The lawsuit accused Gold of “racial violence” by shooting at a Black teenager who was running away.It alleges that due to Gold’s “furtherance of systemic racism”, his immediate perception of Wilson as a “Black person contributed to [Gold’s] decision to shoot [Wilson] without warning when [Wilson] appeared before him”, depriving the teen of “his life and liberty”.Nicholas Rowley, the attorney representing Wilson’s family, told the New York Times Wilson had carried a gun because he had been attacked by gangsters: “The reason why he had a gun is because he is half Black and there were kids, some new gangster kids in San Diego, who had jumped him a few times and hurt him so bad he was in a hospital,” Rowley told the Times. “He was afraid.”","Konoa Wilson, 16, was fatally shot in the back by a police officer as he ran away from a shooting at Santa Fe station.

""I kept asking the IndiGo staff, but they had no idea how to retrieve it. They simply said, ‘Madam, please wait' for hours,"" she said.

""My bag looked like it had been thrown around.

""I had medications in my checked-in bag.I waited almost nine hours and pleaded with the staff to prioritise it, but they said they weren't able to track individual bags,"" she said. When her luggage finally arrived, the zipper had been split open. ""Things were falling out. It was heartbreaking.""UK-bound traveller Prakash Menon described the scene as ""an ocean of abandoned bags"". He added, ""People were climbing over piles to find their luggage.

The international atomic energy agency (IAEA) has said the protective structure built to contain radioactive waste at the Chernobyl nuclear disaster site can no longer fully perform its safety functions after being damaged in a drone strike earlier this year.The new safe confinement (NSC) - the giant steel arch installed to cover the destroyed No 4 reactor - was “severely damaged” during a February 14 strike that sparked a fire and tore through protective cladding, the agency said in a statement on Friday. The IAEA noted the structure has “lost its primary safety functions, including the confinement capability.”Ukraine has accused Russia of carrying out the attack, an allegation the Kremlin has denied.IAEA director general Rafael Mariano Grossi said only “limited temporary repairs” have been made so far. “Timely and comprehensive restoration remains essential to prevent further degradation and ensure long-term nuclear safety,” he added, noting there was no permanent damage to the NSC’s load-bearing structures or monitoring systems. The agency said it would continue supporting Ukraine in efforts to restore full safety at the site.Chernobyl has repeatedly drawn international attention during the nearly four-year war, notably when Russian forces seized and occupied the plant area in early 2022 before withdrawing weeks later.The NSC, completed in 2019, is the world’s largest movable land structure and was designed to last 100 years, enabling long-term cleanup of the world’s worst nuclear accident. Built at a cost of €2.1 billion, it was funded by more than 45 donor nations through the Chernobyl Shelter Fund, which the European bank for reconstruction and development described as “the largest international collaboration ever in the field of nuclear safety. ”The original 1986 explosion at Chernobyl spread radioactive contamination across large parts of Ukraine, Belarus and Russia. More than 30 people were killed immediately, according to the IAEA and the world health organization, with elevated rates of cancer and birth defects persisting in exposed regions.","The new safe confinement (NSC) - the giant steel arch installed to cover the destroyed No 4 reactor - was “severely damaged” during a February 14 strike.

Indian-origin driver Satwinder Singh jailed for over 7 years in New Zealand on rape charges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/indian-origin-driver-satwinder-singh-jailed-for-7-years-in-new-zealand-on-rape-charges-asked-teenage-passenger-if-she-was-wearing-underwear/articleshow/125804966.cms,"



Satwinder Singh, an Indian-origin Uber driver in New Zealand, has been sentenced to seven years and two months' jail for a 2023 incident when he switched the GPS of his cab and diverted to a different route while molesting a teenage passenger. The NZ Herald reported that the teenager had booked a short ride from Speight’s Ale House to an address in Hamilton East, late at night.During the drive, Singh asked the teen if she was wearing underwear when her dress shifted. The teen resisted his advances and told him, “no, can you not?” and later, “get off me” but the driver continued the unwanted contact. He disconnected the GPS, giving the impression that the trip was successfully completed but the cameras saw his car. He locked the car doors, reached over and put the woman's seat in the recline position before kissing her and touching her breasts. He then climbed on top of her and raped her, which the victim described as “very rough and very hurtful”, the report said. The teen was eventually dropped off at a friend's home in a distressed condition.Singh later told the police that it was fabricated and all that happened in the car was consensual.He also said New Zealand women are ""forward and promiscuous"".As the judge gave the verdict, she said the incident had had a ""significant"" impact on the victim's life, eaving her fearful of being away from home and feeling that the outside world was now “unsafe and threatening”. She also lives with “an overwhelming rage inside of her”, intensified by the court process.Singh's counsel sought a hardship discount from the court arguing that he would face additional challenges in custody as he was a Sikh Indian who lived in New Zealand for only 11 years. “He, as you will see, is a follower of the Sikh religion, so prison would place a hardship on him as opposed to someone who was born and raised in New Zealand,"" the counsel said.The judge declined the request and said Singh had worked as an Uber driver, interacting widely with the New Zealand public and should not deserve any special discount in jail. Singh's counsel sought a suppression of his photograph claiming that a close relative of the Uber driver was suffering from mental health issues.","Satwinder Singh, an Indian-origin Uber driver in New Zealand, has been sentenced to seven years and two months' jail for a 2023 incident.

“destroyed home”

HasanAbi challenges Asmongold’s rhetoric and debate avoidance





Hasan Piker, widely known as HasanAbi, has sharply criticized fellow Twitch streamer Asmongold after a recent viral rant in which Asmongold attacked Congresswoman Ilhan Omar and made sweeping comments about immigrants and Muslim communities. On his livestream, HasanAbi described the clip asaccusing Asmongold of pushing harmful stereotypes and misleading narratives about Somali and Muslim immigrants in the U.S. Hasan argued that Asmongold’s stance had little to do with actual policy debates and everything to do with prejudice against Omar’s identity, including her race, religion, and hijab.The controversy began when Asmongold labeled Ilhan Omar aimplied she should be deported despite being a U.S. citizen, and referenced isolated welfare fraud cases to generalize an entire population. He also dismissed Islamophobia as a made-up concept and referred to African countries aswhile claiming immigrants are prioritizing foreign issues over American concerns. HasanAbi responded by calling these claims not only racist but factually incorrect. He also mocked Asmongold’s own personal living setup, ahe refuses to repair, as ironic commentary on who is truly neglecting their own opportunities.During his stream, Hasan argued that Asmongold benefits from minimal pushback due to bot farms and coordinated efforts that drown out critical responses on platforms like Reddit and Twitter. According to Hasan, right-wing creators receive algorithmic and community shielding that prevents accountability, while left-leaning figures face harsher scrutiny and faster disciplinary action. He emphasized that Asmongold’s talking points rely on emotional outrage rather than facts, and extended a challenge for a debate, though he predicted Asmongold would refuse because his arguments would collapse under pressure.Hasan further noted that Ilhan Omar has championed progressive policies such as Medicare for All, free college, and supporting workers’ unions, topics he believes Asmongold deliberately ignores to instead attack her identity. The lack of policy criticism, Hasan said, exposes the real motivation behind the rant: bigotry packaged as political commentary.The exchange has fueled heated conversation across Twitch and social media, with supporters of both creators defending their viewpoints. Whether Asmongold responds directly remains uncertain, but Hasan’s comments make one thing clear: he believes unchecked hate speech online is dangerous and must be called out, especially when directed at public officials already facing threats and discrimination.Also Read: How valuable MrBeast’s Beast Industries has become and what it means for fans","Hasan Piker, widely known as HasanAbi, has sharply criticized fellow Twitch streamer Asmongold after a recent viral rant in which he attacked Congresswoman Ilhan Omar.

Explained: Why even a locked up Imran Khan may still be a threat for Asim Munir,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/explained-why-even-a-locked-up-imran-khan-may-still-be-a-threat-for-asim-munir/articleshow/125789080.cms,"Imran Khan and Asim Munir (R) (AI-generated image used for representation) Source: ChatGPT

Pak President Zardari Approves Asim Munir As The First Chief Of Defence Forces Amid Power Tensions

Why Imran Khan still remains a threat to Asim Munir





PTI without Imran: Still a major force





PTI was barred from contesting the 2024 general elections.

Dozens of PTI leaders were detained.

PTI-backed independents still won more seats than any other group.

Popularity that has not faded





A 2023 Gallup Pakistan survey showed 61% of Pakistanis had a “good opinion” of him -- the highest rating among all national leaders as reported by Dawn.

Arab News quoted analysts saying Khan remains ""too politically relevant to sideline.""

Televised appearances that trigger unrest





Nationwide protests

Arson and clashes

Attacks on military installations, including the Corps Commander’s residence in Lahore

Nationwide mobile shutdowns and troop deployment

Why Pak army cannot 'eliminate' Imran Khan





Key factors keeping Khan politically alive:





Victimhood narrative: Solitary confinement and restricted access cast him as a political prisoner, a powerful image in Pakistan’s grievance-driven politics.

Mobilisation without presence: PTI’s digital machinery enables mass mobilisation even without Khan physically present.

Diaspora and social media influence: Global PTI networks amplify every statement, intensifying scrutiny on Pakistan’s military.

High-risk optics: Every court appearance or televised moment risks sparking unrest.

The state vs sentiment





The jail sentence - not the silence





Constitutional shift and expanding military power





Munir's foreign outreach and US engagement





Imran's strength: Mobilisation without access





Why the military needs more than power









Is Imran Khan still a threat to Asim Munir ? The question looms over Pakistan ’s power structure. Former Prime Minister and cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan, now over two years into imprisonment, remains a potent challenge to army chief Asim Munir — whose rapid ascent and consolidation of authority have made him Pakistan’s de facto ruler.With Munir now elevated as the Pakistan's first chief of defence forces, commanding the army, navy and air force, his institutional power is at its strongest — yet the confrontation with Khan, even from behind bars, continues to shadow that authority. The two have been locked in a prolonged, deeply personal confrontation.Despite being confined, Khan has transformed from a jailed political leader into a symbolic and political counterweight to Munir’s expanding military-political dominance.Far from fading, the rivalry between the two men has only sharpened. Munir commands the state; Khan commands sentiment. And as the events of the last two years show, sentiment can be far harder to control.Imran Khan's incarceration has fuelled a narrative of persecution and martyrdom among supporters. Long spells of isolation, restrictions on visits, and recurring allegations of mistreatment have strengthened this perception, with some analysts warning that these measures risk backfiring.Imtiaz Gul, executive director of the Center for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), told Al Jazeera: ""The primary objective of blocking access and keeping Khan in solitary confinement is apparently meant to break him into (agreeing to) a compromise and neutralise the groundswell of anti-government sentiment.”Increasingly, barring visits to Khan is viewed not merely as a security decision, but as a political strategy that may harm the governing PML-N and reinforce Khan’s narrative of institutional overreach.Even without its leader on the ballot, PTI remains one of Pakistan's strongest political forces.PTI claims widespread rigging, accusing the government and military of manipulating the results, allegations echoed by several independent observers. The establishment denies all wrongdoing, but the perception of electoral injustice has only strengthened PTI’s street momentum.For perspective, Imran Khan’s PTI had won 151 seats in the 2018 elections, defeating Nawaz Sharif’s PML-N (81 seats) and PPP (54). That victory was hailed by PTI as ""the end of an era,"" breaking the decades-long political monopoly of the PML-N, PPP and the military establishment.Despite his imprisonment, Khan remains Pakistan’s most popular political figure.This enduring popularity, even at a time of complete political inability, poses a direct challenge to Munir's authority.Even brief, controlled public appearances continue to spark major political reactions.During the May 2023 unrest, Imran Khan's court appearance -- after his dramatic arrest by paramilitary forces -- showed him flashing a victory sign. The televised images spread instantly and triggered:These scenes were unprecedented not only for their scale but because the anger erupted in Punjab, the heart of Pakistan's military recruitment and administrative base.More recently, when false rumours about Khan’s death spread, PTI supporters mobilised across Islamabad, Rawalpindi, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, again forcing an immediate government response.A leader who provokes unrest without speaking remains difficult to contain.An analysis in The Diplomat warns that the army ""cannot afford to eliminate"" a leader with deep political roots in Punjab.Such an act, the report cautions, could ""unleash one that the state may not survive.""Khan is ethnically Pashtun but politically anchored in Punjab, with support stretching across Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and the diaspora. His arrest in 2023 showed that anger against the military establishment now emerges in Punjab.Eliminating him would not neutralise his influence; it would likely create a ""martyr"" of unprecedented scale.Munir commands the state apparatus. Khan commands sentiment.And in Pakistan, sentiment has repeatedly proved more enduring than power.No prime minister has survived a confrontation with the military, but no army chief has faced a jailed leader with such widespread support and political resilience.Since August 2023, Khan has faced a series of corruption and security-related cases. In January 2025, he received a 14-year sentence in a land-graft case, a verdict his supporters claim was engineered to keep him out of politics.Khan’s public statements from jail fuel the perception of political persecution. He has directly accused Munir of ""moral bankruptcy,"" and called him ""mentally unstable man"" claiming Pakistan's constitution and rule of law have collapsed under him: ""I have been kept in complete solitary confinement, locked inside a cell with no contact with a single human being for four weeks… even the basic necessities guaranteed under the jail manual have been taken away from us. ""His family members have echoed concerns about his treatment. His sister, after visiting him, said he told her they were subjecting him to ""mental torture"" and held Asim Munir responsible.The recent 27th amendment -- widely called a ""constitutional coup"" -- has entrenched military dominance further. Munir's elevation as chief of defence forces gives him command over all three services.Mahmood Khan Achakzai, head of Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-e-Pakistan, warned: ""There is no constitution in Pakistan now. No judiciary. No social contract. They have made one man into a king above all.""Months ago, Munir's increasing visibility included multiple meetings with Donald Trump. Munir even nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, crediting him with easing India–Pakistan high military tensions, a move driven by a desire for US recognition. Trump later referred to him as his ""favourite field marshal.""It is often assumed that political power requires physical presence. Imran's continuing influence disproves that assumption.His followers still speak of him not as a convicted convict, but as a leader wronged. The slogans, the sense of injustice, the personal stories -- all add up to mobilisation potential. And that potential doesn’t require Khan’s freedom; it only requires people’s belief.Statements from his family amplify this -- for instance, the anguish voiced by his son over not knowing whether his father is safe in jail. Such public airing of fear and trauma becomes a magnet for sympathy and solidarity.""Not knowing whether your father is safe, injured or even alive is a form of psychological torture,"" he had said in written remarks.However, Imran Khan's sister was eventually allowed to meet the former prime minister. After the visit, she said, ""Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he told me they are subjecting him to mental torture, and that Asim Munir is responsible for all of this.""For the military leadership under Asim Munir, the calculus is not just about brute strength, it is about legitimacy. Pakistan’s power dynamics have long relied on a veneer of neutrality: the idea that the army guards the system while politics handles politics. Overplaying that role risks shattering the illusion.From Ayub Khan and Yahya Khan to Zia-ul-Haq and Pervez Musharraf , every era of military rule reinforced the pattern: the army positioned itself not merely as a defender of borders, but as the ultimate arbiter of Pakistan's politics and identity.Each takeover was justified through narratives of chaos, corruption, or national security, allowing the establishment to retain dominance even during civilian periods. Today, under Asim Munir, this pattern continues in a more sophisticated form: instead of overt coups, power is exercised through constitutional engineering, judicial pressure, and political sidelining, most visibly in the dismantling of Imran Khan’s political career. The military’s quest is not only to command the state but to remain indispensable to its very definition.As long as Imran Khan remains a contested figure, not just legally, but symbolically, the army's claim to neutrality becomes harder to maintain.International pressure, media scrutiny, and internal dissent all rise with every heavy-handed move.Hence, the challenge for Munir may be deeper than suppressing one man, it is about managing optics, institutional trust and political fallout.",Is Imran Khan still a threat to Asim Munir? The question looms over Pakistan ’s power structure. Khan has transformed from a jailed political leader into a symbolic and political counterweight to Munir’s expanding military-political dominance.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125789753,imgsize-1800195,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-62.jpg"
"Ghaziabad Jeweller Murder: Killed in 60 seconds, Ghaziabad jeweller stabbed to death during robbery; accused watched 25 YouTube ‘heist tutorials’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ghaziabad/ghaziabad-jeweller-75-stabbed-to-death-during-heist-attacker-had-rs-20l-debt/articleshow/125774855.cms,"GHAZIABAD: A 75-year-old jewellery shop owner in Modinagar was stabbed to death on Thursday morning during a robbery in Govindpuri. CCTV footage, retrieved by police, shows the victim seated at the counter when a man wearing a monkey cap enters, throws red chilli powder in his face, then climbs onto the counter and stabs him more than 10 times. The assailant was caught by local residents after a brief chase, about 30 metres from the shop, and later detained by police.The incident occurred shortly after 8.30 am, when the victim, Girdhari Lal, had opened his shop, Girdhari Lal & Sons Jewellery, on the ground floor of his residence. Locals said Lal, a long-time resident of Govindpuri colony, typically opened his store earlier than others in the area, a routine the assailant, Ankit Gupta, allegedly knew.A bike taxi rider living in the same area until his family relocated a month ago, Gupta was allegedly under financial stress after losing around Rs 20 lakh in shares and online gaming, police said. He knew that Lal owned three other jewellery shops and was well off. For a week, he recced Lal's Govindpuri shop and timed his attack to coincide with the early opening hours to take advantage of the lack of customers and other shopkeepers in the vicinity, police said.On Thursday, the accused entered the shop just after Lal began his day. He threw a fistful of red chilli powder into Lal's face. And even before Lal could react, Gupta climbed onto the shop's counter and slashed and stabbed him repeatedly with a knife, leaving him dead within seconds.Lal's son, Rupendra Soni, heard his father's screams and rushed into the shop, and tried to restrain the attacker. Soni hurled the assailant on a bench, but Soni pulled out what appeared to be a gun—a later investigation revealed it was a toy—and managed to give him a slip.As Soni chased him, local shopkeepers, responding to the commotion, captured the assailant roughly 25-30 metres from the shop. He was beaten by the crowd before being handed over to the police.The entire assault that lasted fewer than 60 seconds was captured in a CCTV camera installed in the shop. Police said they were analysing CCTV footage and gathering witness accounts to reconstruct the events in full.ACP Modinagar Amit Saxena said preliminary investigations indicated that Gupta targeted Lal's shop with the intention to steal jewellery. ""He had planned the robbery around a week in advance. After attacking Lal, he had planned to grab the jewellery on display in a bag that he was carrying. It seems he hadn't anticipated that Soni or anyone would arrive so quickly,"" the officer said, adding that a toy gun had been recovered from Gupta.DCP (Rural) Surendra Nath Tiwari said Gupta has been detained and is being questioned. While no FIR was lodged till the filing of the report, police said the process of registering one was on.Police said the accused had bought the knife online and received it only on Wednesday. In the five days leading up to the crime, Gupta allegedly watched more than 25 heist videos on YouTube to prepare for the robbery, cops added. He also claimed to own a YouTube channel, Desire Telefilms, that has 6,25,000 subscribers.The attack sparked outrage among local residents and shopkeepers, many of whom shut down shops in protest, accusing the police of failing to maintain law and order. Sudheer Singh, a local shopkeeper, said, ""The police chowki is just 200m away, yet patrolling is rare. A robbery attempt at Lal's shop happened two years ago, and the culprits were never caught. Even recent thefts in nearby shops are unresolved.""DCP Tiwari assured the community that additional police forces had been deployed and that security measures in the area would be reviewed. He confirmed that a dedicated team would remain stationed in the market to prevent future incidents and increase patrolling in the area.","A 75-year-old jewellery shop owner was stabbed to death on Thursday morning during a robbery in Govindpuri.

India’s most-wanted maoist Kabir surrenders with his core squad in Madhya Pradesh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/indias-most-wanted-maoist-kabir-surrenders-with-his-core-squad-in-madhya-pradesh/articleshow/125813222.cms,"’Naxal-Maoist Terror Nearly Wiped Out Across India’: PM Modi Hails Police, CRPF, BSF

BHOPAL: In a major breakthrough for Madhya Pradesh’s anti-Naxal campaign, 10 Maoists of the Kanha–Bhoramdeo (KB) division — including most-wanted commander Surendar alias Kabir, who carries a Rs 77-lakh bounty — surrendered before security forces in Balaghat late Saturday night after covert negotiations facilitated by the Special Intelligence Unit (SIU) of the Hawk Force. The surrender was formalised at the official bungalow of the Inspector General (IG), Balaghat Range, after the rebels made first contact through a forest guard whom they trusted.Sources said the Maoists had initially planned to surrender in Chhattisgarh due to trust issues with Madhya Pradesh authorities, but following multiple rounds of backchannel communication and assurances from Hawk Force’s SIU, they agreed to lay down arms in Balaghat. The group arrived in two batches and surrendered under heavy security, handing over automatic weapons, rifles, grenades and detonators.Those who surrendered were identified as Surendar alias Kabir (Secretary of the Special MMC Zone) with an AK-47 rifle and 100 rounds; Rakesh Hodi, his close associate, with an AK-47 and 37 rounds; Lalsingh with an INSAS rifle and 40 rounds; Shilpa; Naveen; and Jayshila with SLR and 22 rounds; Vikram with a rifle and 7 rounds; Zarina with a rifle and 10 rounds; and Samar with detonators and 05 units.Police said this is one of the most significant surrenders ever recorded in the Kanha–Bhoramdeo zone, and with this development, Mandla district is now being considered effectively free of Maoist presence.Officials said the Maoists capitulated under the cumulative pressure of intensified search and domination operations launched after Hawk Force Inspector Ashish Sharma’s martyrdom on Wednesday. Sharma, 32, a decorated officer with two gallantry medals and an out-of-turn promotion, was killed in an encounter near Bor Talab at the sensitive tri-junction of MP, Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh. His death triggered an all-front coordinated response by Hawk Force, MP Police, Maharashtra’s commandos and Chhattisgarh Police, steadily shrinking operational space for the KB division.The 10 cadres will now participate in a state-level formal surrender programme, during which they will publicly lay down arms before Chief Minister Dr Mohan Yadav in Balaghat, marking a rare high-value ceremonial surrender under the state’s 2023 Naxal Surrender and Rehabilitation Policy. The surrendered weapons — including AK-47s, INSAS, SLR rifles, ammunition, improvised explosive materials and communication devices — have been seized for forensic and intelligence mapping.The development also reflects widening cracks within Maoist ranks. It comes weeks after the surrender of 23-year-old ACM-level cadre Sunita, member of the personal guard unit of CCM Ramder, who gave herself up at the Chauriya Hawk Force camp on October 31. Officials said her intelligence inputs suggested that several senior Maoist leaders in the Maad–Indravati–Darrekasa sector had already deserted or surrendered, triggering uncertainty and mistrust among remaining cadres.Security forces have now intensified presence across Lanji, Kirnapur, Baihar and adjoining forest belts touching Gadchiroli and Bijapur, anticipating further surrenders as operational dominance increases. Intelligence officials say the capture of Kabir, Hodi and other key KB division operatives marks a decisive shift in the anti-Naxal grid, and the Mandla–Balaghat belt may soon witness one of its most peaceful phases in decades.","10 Maoists of the Kanha–Bhoramdeo (KB) division surrendered before security forces in Balaghat late Saturday night.

US defense secretary Pete Hegseth on Saturday declined to say whether the Pentagon will release video footage from the September 2 operation targeting an alleged drug-smuggling vessel in the Caribbean - an attack that killed eleven people and has drawn renewed scrutiny after reports that a second missile killed survivors of the initial strike.""We're reviewing the process, and we'll see,"" Hegseth said during a Q&A at a defense forum hosted by the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California. ""Whatever we were to decide to release, we'd have to be very responsible about reviewing that right now.""The Washington Post reported last week that two survivors attempting to climb back aboard the vessel were struck by a second missile. The White House has confirmed that the second strike occurred, though both the White House and Hegseth deny he ordered it. Hegseth reiterated that the second missile was authorised by navy admiral Frank “Mitch” Bradley, who led the operation. “In this particular case, it was well within the authorities of Adm. Bradley,” he said.Lawmakers were shown video of the second strike in a closed-door session on Thursday. After the briefing, Sen. Tom Cotton and Rep. Jim Himes told reporters that Bradley had said he had not been ordered to leave no survivors.The Post, citing an anonymous source, had reported that Hegseth issued an order that “everyone on the boat be taken out.”Hegseth rejected the allegation on Saturday. ""You don't walk in and say 'Kill them all.' It's just patently ridiculous,"" he said, adding the report was “meant to create a cartoon of me and the decisions that we make.” Still, he said he “fully support[s] that strike” and “would have made the same call myself.”Sources familiar with the video told CBS News that the two survivors were waving overhead before being hit, a gesture that could have been interpreted as either calling for help or warning against another strike. Some legal experts have questioned whether the second strike could constitute a war crime.The September 2 attack was the first in a series of vessel strikes in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific. According to Pentagon figures, at least 87 people have been killed in 22 such strikes, though the administration has not released evidence the targeted vessels were carrying narcotics. On Wednesday, President Donald Trump said, ""I don't know what they have, but whatever they have we'll certainly release, no problem. ""Despite that assurance, Hegseth maintained Saturday that the Pentagon is still weighing any release. “We are reviewing it right now,” he said.In his speech, Hegseth also defended the broader campaign against suspected drug-smuggling boats. “We've been clear, if you're working for a designated terrorist organization, and you bring drugs into this country in a boat, we will find you and we will sink you,” he said. “...We are killing them. We will keep killing them so long as they are poisoning our people with narcotics so lethal they're tantamount to chemical weapons. ”","US defense secretary Pete Hegseth declined to say whether the Pentagon will release video footage from the September 2 operation targeting an alleged drug- smuggling vessel.

Trump renews filibuster fight: GOP Senators push back in election year; Thune faces leadership test,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-renews-filibuster-fight-gop-senators-push-back-in-election-year-thune-faces-leadership-test/articleshow/125812614.cms,"‘DARE YOU USE…’: Trump Picks Putin Over EU Allies? Lobbies Against Ursula On Frozen Russian Assets





President Donald Trump is continuing his push to eliminate the Senate filibuster, creating fresh tensions within the Republican caucus as lawmakers head into a critical election year. Senate Republicans, who have largely backed the president on major legislative and executive priorities, remain resistant to ending the 60-vote threshold, despite Trump’s repeated demands to ease legislative gridlock.Several GOP senators say the numbers simply aren’t there. “I know this has been an important priority for the president, but I think he has too many people telling him that this is achievable when it doesn’t strike me as achievable,” Senator Todd Young said, adding, “I don’t think we’re close to having the votes, just to be candid.”Majority Leader John Thune and most Senate Republicans rejected Trump’s call last month to scrap the filibuster during the record-long government shutdown. Still, the pressure continues to mount, leaving rank-and-file lawmakers wary of crossing Trump while also trying to preserve longstanding Senate norms.Despite Trump’s insistence, less than a quarter of Senate Republicans have shown openness to ending or modifying the filibuster.A few, however, have shifted. Sen Ron Johnson reversed his stance during the shutdown, saying Trump was right. Sen John Cornyn, facing a primary challenge, has also said he is open to reconsidering Senate traditions.The debate comes as Congress prepares for multiple deadlines early next year, including funding the government by Jan. 30, addressing rising health costs, completing the farm bill and renewing key surveillance authorities.Asked whether Trump will continue pressing the issue, a White House official pointed to his Truth Social post warning that Democrats would pack the Supreme Court “unless we TERMINATE THE FILIBUSTER, which will lead to an easy WIN of the Midterms, and an even easier WIN in the Presidential Election of 2028.”Advisers close to the White House say the filibuster fight is emerging as a key leadership test for Thune. “Every Republican prior to two months ago has been adamantly against getting rid of the filibuster and because Trump wants to get rid of the filibuster, John Thune either has to swallow another red pill or wean himself off,” said one person granted anonymity.Despite the disagreements, both sides have maintained a working relationship. Trump last month called senators who rejected his push “very smart people” and has continued to praise Thune. A person familiar with Senate leadership said, “This isn’t a relationship dealbreaker.”Trump made similar attempts in his first term, but then-majority leader Mitch McConnell declined to consider the move, citing insufficient support. Some Trump allies also pushed to fire the Senate parliamentarian during debate earlier this year on the administration’s “big, beautiful bill,” a request Thune refused.Several GOP senators remain adamant that the filibuster is not going anywhere. “It’s a moot issue. We’re just not going to get rid of the filibuster,” said Sen John Kennedy.Still, Trump’s supporters argue Republicans should act now in anticipation of Democrats scrapping the rule if they regain power. Sen Tommy Tuberville said Trump has raised the matter with lawmakers directly, noting, “I just got a feeling … it’s just a matter of time that they’re going to vote and get rid of it whenever they take over the majority next time.”Sen Josh Hawley framed the push as urgency to deliver results ahead of the 2026 midterms. Trump, he said, is “the one who’s right now pushing Congress to act… We need to deliver more.”","President Donald Trump is continuing his push to eliminate the Senate filibuster.

‘I want my husband home’: Green card holder ​Allan Dabrio Marrero misses mail; detained by ICE,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/i-want-my-husband-home-green-card-holder-allan-dabrio-marrero-misses-mail-detained-by-ice/articleshow/125812459.cms,"ICE Officers ‘Pepper-spray’ Dem Grijalva At Arizona Raid; DHS Fires Back | ‘Medical Miracle If True’





A green card applicant was detained by the ICE agents because he missed a piece of mail from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services during a recent move.Allan Dabrio Marrero, who is married to a US citizen, Matthew Marrero, and used to live in the Cayman Islands, was detained by ICE agents last week at 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan. His husband and their church family are seeking his release, arguing that he has no criminal history and was meticulous with his paperwork, Newsweek reported.“The way the narrative has been spun to the general public is that they’re going after the worst of the worst. And that is not true,” Matthew Marrero told ABC 7. “My husband is a contributing member to society, is proud to want to be an American.”More cases of green card applicants married to US citizens have been reported in recent weeks, as the Trump administration tightened immigration enforcement against those who overstayed visas or had minor paperwork issues. While such arrests have been uncommon at Federal Plaza, the building has been the site of multiple protests over the detention of immigrants appearing before immigration judges.Allan Marrero has lived in the US for over a decade. He left the Cayman Islands, where he was a citizen, to find a safer place to live as a member of the LGBTQ+ community and applied for asylum in the US. He met his husband via social media two years ago.The couple married and applied for Allan’s marriage-based green card, with his interview scheduled for last week in Lower Manhattan.Unaware that he had missed a December 2022 notice summoning him to an immigration hearing, USCIS marked him as having failed to appear, triggering removal proceedings. At last week’s appointment, the couple learned that Allan had an order of removal. ICE agents then detained him and transferred him to Delaney Hall in Newark, New Jersey, where he remains.A GoFundMe campaign started by the family has raised over $15,500 to cover legal fees and visiting costs at the New Jersey detention centre.The Department of Homeland Security stated that it targets the “worst of the worst” among alleged illegal immigrants, namely those with criminal convictions. Immigration advocates and attorneys say the evidence contradicts this claim, noting that Allan is one of a growing number of individuals arrested while lawfully pursuing a green card.“I just want so badly to get my husband home. I hope, I pray, that he’ll be able to get out before the holidays,” Matthew Marrero told Documented in New York.“He is a law-abiding, tax paying, work visa holding SHOULD BE citizen, who left the Cayman Islands to come to the USA to seek asylum from discrimination against homosexuality. A man who fell in love in a place he felt safe to do so. And after being married to Matthew for over two years, is entitled to a green card based on a Bonafide marriage. Not to be blindsided when doing what they were told is the right thing to do,” said Andrea Marrero, Allan’s sister-in-law, on GoFundMe.","Allan Dabrio Marrero, who is married to a US citizen, was detained by ICE agents last week at 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan.

More than 18 million people across the West and Midwest are under winter weather alerts as a series of storms brings heavy snow, dangerous wind chills and the threat of flooding, according to forecasts from CBS outlets and the National Weather Service.A strong weather system is already generating heavy snowfall across the Northern Rockies, with higher elevations expected to receive a foot or more through Saturday, CBS Meteorologist Andrew Kozak said. As the system shifts eastward, snow is forecast to spread into the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest, from South Dakota to northwest Illinois, where 4–6 inches and isolated higher totals are likely.Chicago is under a winter weather advisory, with 2–5 inches expected to create slick roads and sidewalks by early morning, CBS Chicago reported. The cold outbreak following the snow may send temperatures plunging below zero across parts of the Dakotas and Minnesota by Sunday night into Monday. Another round of snow is expected to hit the metro region and southern Minnesota on Saturday afternoon, CBS Minnesota reported, accompanied by bitter temperatures.The National Weather Service has also projected moderate to heavy snow over parts of the upper and middle Mississippi Valley on Saturday night.Farther west, winter storm warnings and advisories are in effect across Colorado, with mountain regions expected to bear the brunt of the snowfall, CBS Colorado reported.Meanwhile, the Pacific Northwest is bracing for a series of incoming Pacific systems beginning late Sunday into Monday. Kozak said the region is likely to see widespread heavy rain across western Washington and Oregon, with flash flooding possible due to saturated soil. Flood watches are already in place, and forecasters warn that the heavy rain threat may persist for 5–10 days.","More than 18 million people across the West and Midwest are under winter weather alerts.

An illegal immigrant, who is identified as Oscar Gerardo Solorzano-Garcia, was taken into custody in connection with a stabbing on a light rail in Charlotte, North Carolina.While investigating the case, the police discovered that the 33-year-old suspect was actually deported twice back to his country.Solorzano-Garcia was issued a final deportation order in 2018 and was removed from the United States on March 9 of that year, DHS said. He was arrested crossing the border illegally again in 2021 and removed a second time. DHS said he apparently re-entered the US a third time at an unknown date and location.DHS Secretary Kristi Noem condemned the alleged stabbing, saying the incident “should have never happened.“This heinous stabbing by this twice removed illegal alien should have NEVER happened. ICE lodged an arrest detainer to ensure Oscar Gerardo Solorzano-Garcia is not released back into North Carolina neighborhoods. Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee the county will honor the detainer since they have a history of not cooperating with ICE,” said Secretary Noem in a press statement released by DHS.“Under President Trump, ICE is being unleashed to ensure public safety for all Americans.

A powerful magnitude-7.0 earthquake struck in a remote area near the border between Alaska and the Canadian territory of Yukon on Saturday.There was no tsunami warning, and officials said there were no immediate reports of damage or injury, AP news agency reported.The U.S. Geological Survey said it struck about 230 miles (370 kilometres) northwest of Juneau, Alaska, and 155 miles (250 kilometres) west of Whitehorse, Yukon.In Whitehorse, Royal Canadian Mounted Police Sgt. Calista MacLeod said the detachment received two 911 calls about the quake. “It definitely was felt,” MacLeod said. “There are a lot of people on social media, people felt it.”Alison Bird, a seismologist with Natural Resources Canada, said the part of Yukon most affected by the temblor is mountainous and has few people. “Mostly people have reported things falling off shelves and walls,” Bird said. “It doesn’t seem like we’ve seen anything in terms of structural damage.”The Canadian community nearest to the epicentre is Haines Junction, about 80 miles (130 kilometres) away, Bird said. The Yukon Bureau of Statistics listed its population at 1,018 for 2022. The quake was also about 56 miles (91 kilometres) from Yakutat, Alaska, which the USGS said has 662 residents.It struck at a depth of about 6 miles (10 kilometres) and was followed by multiple smaller aftershocks.","There was no tsunami warning, and officials said there were no immediate reports of damage or injury.

Biggest ever US travel ban in the works?

The United States is planning to expand the number of countries that were covered by its travel ban - and the new list may include over 30 countries.US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, on Thursday, during an interview on Fox News’ The Ingraham Angle, when asked whether President Donald Trump’s administration would increase the number to 32, she said “I won’t be specific on the number, but it’s over 30, and the president is continuing to evaluate countries. ""In June, Trump signed a proclamation banning citizens of 12 countries from entering the United States and restricting those from seven others, saying it was needed to protect against “foreign terrorists” and other security threats, Reuters reported.The bans applied to both immigrants and non-immigrants, such as tourists, students and business travellers.Noem did not specify which countries would be added to the list. “If they don’t have a stable government there, if they don’t have a country that can sustain itself and tell us who those individuals are and help us vet them, why should we allow people from that country to come here to the United States?” she said.Reuters previously reported that the Trump administration was considering banning citizens of 36 additional countries from entering the United States, according to an internal State Department cable.An expansion of the list would mark a further escalation of migration measures the administration had taken since the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, DC, last week.Investigators said the shooting was carried out by an Afghan national who entered the US in 2021 through a resettlement programme under which Trump administration officials have argued there was insufficient vetting. Days after the shooting, Trump vowed to “permanently pause” migration from all “Third World Countries,” although he did not identify any by name or define “third-world countries.”Prior to that, officials from the Department of Homeland Security said Trump had ordered a widespread review of asylum cases approved under the administration of his predecessor, Democratic President Joe Biden, and Green Cards issued to citizens of 19 countries. Since returning to office in January, Trump has aggressively prioritised immigration enforcement, sending federal agents to major US cities and turning away asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border. His administration has frequently highlighted the deportation push, but until now it has put less emphasis on efforts to reshape legal immigration.","US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the president is 'continuing to evaluate countries' In June, President Donald Trump signed a proclamation banning citizens of 12 countries from entering the United States.

Survivors were in 'clear distress'

Survivors were trying to 'stay in the fight'

Trump says Pete 'didn't know what people were talking about'





Two people who survived the September 2nd US strike on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean were seen waving before they were killed in a second follow-up strike, sources familiar with a video shown to lawmakers revealed.One source said the gestures could be interpreted as the survivors either calling for help or surrendering to avoid another strike.The operation was the first of more than 20 US attacks on suspected drug-carrying vessels under the Trump administration. The GOP leader has defended the campaign as a necessary way to curb narcotics trafficking. However, the premise remains legally questionable. The Pentagon has reported that more than 80 people have died in these strikes, including 11 in the initial September 2 attack.Members of Congress were shown video of the strikes, including the follow-up attack that killed the two survivors, during a closed-door briefing with the operation's commander, Adm. Mitch Bradley, and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine, according to CBS News.Democratic Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut described the scene as one of the most difficult things hes ever seen in his life. He said the survivors appeared “in clear distress without any means of locomotion.”Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas defended the strikes. He said the survivors were “trying to flip a boat loaded with drugs bound for the United States back over so they could stay in the fight” and clarified that the strikes were “entirely lawful and needful.”US President Donald Trump hinted he would support releasing the video to the public, but denied knowledge of any order given to target survivors. “I don't know that that happened. And Pete said he did not want that — he didn't even know what people were talking about. We'll look into it. But no, I wouldn't have wanted that. Not a second strike,” he said.Trump has also said that Venezuela’s airspace should now be considered “closed” amid rising tensions.Defensed department officials have defended the operations as legal and necessary. Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell told The Washington Post that “ongoing operations to dismantle narcoterrorism and to protect the Homeland from deadly drugs have been a resounding success.”Defense secretary Pete Hegseth said the strikes were “lethal, kinetic strikes” aimed at stopping drug trafficking and destroying vessels affiliated with “Designated Terrorist Organisations.”Legal experts and lawmakers have expressed concern that targeting survivors could constitute a war crime.","Survivors seen waving before they were killed in a second follow-up strike.

US defence secretary Pete Hegseth on Saturday defended the ongoing series of strikes on suspected drug-smuggling vessels, asserting that President Donald Trump has full authority to order military action to protect national security. His remarks came during a keynote address at the Reagan National Defense Forum at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California.The strikes, which have reportedly killed more than 80 people, have drawn scrutiny from lawmakers over questions of legality and compliance with international law. Some members of Congress have also sought clarity on whether US forces were directed to carry out a second strike in September despite Pentagon awareness of survivors from the first.Rejecting criticism, Hegseth compared the counter-narcotics campaign to the post-9/11 war on terror. “If you’re working for a designated terrorist organization and you bring drugs to this country in a boat, we will find you and we will sink you. Let there be no doubt about it,” he said.He added, “President Trump can and will take decisive military action as he sees fit to defend our nation’s interests. Let no country on earth doubt that for a moment.”While Hegseth framed the alleged smugglers as equivalent to Al-Qaida operatives, several security experts have pointed out that the contexts and adversaries differ significantly.His address followed the release of the administration’s updated national security strategy, which underscores a harder line towards European allies and emphasises renewed US dominance in the Western Hemisphere. Hegseth also highlighted the need to counter China’s rise “through strength”, reiterating Trump’s pledge to resume nuclear testing on par with China and Russia - a position that has raised concerns among nuclear specialists. Beijing and Moscow have not carried out explosive tests in decades, though Russia has said it would mirror any US resumption.Positioning Trump as Reagan’s “true and rightful heir” on foreign policy, Hegseth criticised Republican leaders over the years for backing Middle East wars and democracy-building efforts. He also dismissed arguments that climate change poses security risks, saying, “The war department will not be distracted by democracy building, interventionism, undefined wars, regime change, climate change, woke moralizing and feckless nation building. ”(With inputs from agencies)","US defence secretary Pete Hegseth defended the ongoing series of strikes on suspected drug-smuggling vessels.

"US coast guard snipes drug boat from chopper; seizes 20,000 pounds of cocaine",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-coast-guard-snipes-drug-boat-from-chopper-seizes-20000-pounds-of-cocaine-watch/articleshow/125812166.cms,"‘Drug Boat’ Shocker: New Video Shows Survivors Frantically Waving Right Before Fatal Second Strike





The United States coast guard disabled a high-speed “go-fast” boat via helicopter sniper fire and seized over 20,000 pounds of cocaine in a single mission - the largest such haul by a national security cutter to date.Video put out by Fox News shows coast guard personnel, including a sniper from the service’s helicopter interdiction tactical squadron (HITRON), stationed in Jacksonville, Florida, firing at the vessel’s engines from a helicopter to disable the boat before boarding. The interception and seizure took place in the Eastern Pacific, south of Mexico. According to the Coast Guard, the haul represents more than 7.5 million potentially lethal doses of cocaine.The operation was carried out under Operation Pacific Viper, a joint coast guard–navy initiative launched in August as part of the current administration’s crackdown on drug-trafficking cartels in Latin America. By October, the coast guard said the operation had already netted 100,000 pounds of cocaine in the eastern Pacific - roughly 1,600 pounds per day.In November, the coast guard reported nearly 510,000 pounds of cocaine seized in fiscal year 2025 - the highest annual total in the service’s history.Officials noted this amount translates to some 193 million potentially lethal doses, “enough to jeopardise more than half of the US population,” and amounts to more than three times the service’s usual yearly average of about 167,000 pounds.The “go-fast” boat interdiction is typical of the tactics used to curb the flow of narcotics across waterways. In such missions, HITRON snipers disable engines so that Coast Guard cutters and other assets can board and seize contraband. According to the service, this approach played a key role in the success of the most recent action.Separately, the administration has reportedly conducted at least 22 strikes against suspected drug vessels in Latin American waters since September. Some lawmakers have questioned the legality of those strikes - particularly one that targeted a second vessel after the first strike left survivors. In response, the White House asserted its authority to carry out such attacks.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senators Tim Kaine, Adam Schiff and Rand Paul on Wednesday introduced a war-powers resolution aimed at blocking the president from using US armed forces to conduct hostilities in or against Venezuela. Meanwhile, defence secretary Pete Hegseth affirmed that strikes on “narco-boats” will continue, saying, “We’ve only just begun striking narco-boats and putting narco-terrorists at the bottom of the ocean because they’ve been poisoning the American people. ”","U.S. coast guard disabled a high-speed ‘go-fast’ boat via helicopter sniper fire and seized over 20,000 pounds of cocaine in a single mission.
