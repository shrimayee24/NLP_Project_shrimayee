NEW DELHI: After two nursery students, four-year-old girls, were sexually abused by the sweeper of a reputed school in Thane district, protests erupted at Badlapur railway station on Tuesday where local trains were stopped and agitators blocked the tracks.Read more: Maharashtra Kids Sex Abuse Live Updates: CPRO Central Railway said, ""Local trains stopped at Badlapur railway station where protesters agitated against the alleged sexual assault incident with two minor girls at a school in Badlapur.""More than four hours have passed since the protesters descended on tracks but police and authorities are unable to convince protesters who refused to heed pleas for the withdrawal of the blockade.A call for Badlapur bandh has been given by several organisations to protest against the incident.Residents in Badlapur protested against the sexual abuse of two minor girls which occurred last week. Local train movement has been affected as protests are underway at Badlapur Station. Police have arrested a person in the case. The parents came to know about the incident on August 18 and filed anFIR .Two four-year-old nursery students were allegedly sexually abused by a newly hired sweeper at an English medium school in Thane district. The 24-year-old accused was arrested on Saturday, but the parents of the victims expressed their dissatisfaction with the police's handling of the case. They claimed that the FIR was registered more than 12 hours after the complaint was lodged, and only after the intervention of the District Women and Child Welfare Department.The school administration on Monday suspended the principal, class teacher , and female attendant, holding them responsible for the incident.The school administration has also come under scrutiny for allowing a male sweeper, who was hired on August 1, to accompany the young girls to the washroom. The incident came to light when one of the girls confided in her grandfather about the sexual abuse by the school staff member when he would take her and her friend to the washroom. The family then discussed the matter with the other girl's parents, who revealed that their daughter had recently become afraid to go to school.The families took the four-year-olds for a medical check-up with a private doctor, who confirmed that the girls had been sexually abused. They then approached a local MNS leader who accompanied them to the police station on Friday at 12.30 pm. However, instead of promptly recording the parents' statements and registering an FIR, the police station in-charge, Shubhada Shitole, allegedly made them wait for hours, stating that they needed to verify the claim first. Sources claimed that a police team visited the school but were informed that the CCTV cameras had not been functioning for the past few days.It was only after the District Women and Child Welfare Department intervened, police registered a case under the Pocso Act past midnight. On Saturday morning, police also got the girls’ medical examination conducted at a govt hospital as a private medical test is not valid in court.The police station incharge, Subhada Shitole, has been transferred to the special branch by Thane police for delaying the registration of the FIR when the parents of the child approached the police station.Locals said that along with citizens, rickshaw union, traders’ union, jewellers association, and now some political parties have also come forward to join the bandh. The accused, who was hired by the school on August 1, will remain in police remand until August 21.Rajya Sabha MP from UBT Sena, Priyanka Chaturvedi expressed her deep concern and condemned the incident.""Two young girls were sexually assaulted in Badlapur, Maharashtra in the school premises; the entire state is outraged and seeks justice. I once again urge the President to approve the Maharashtra Shakti Criminal Law, so that no other child or woman faces this travesty. Shame on the state government to continue to ignore the safety of women,"" she posted on X.Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray demanded a fast-track trial and speedy justice in the case of sexual abuse of two girls at a school in Thane district. Talking to reporters, Thackeray said on one hand, the Mahayuti government is running the Mukhyamantri Ladki Bahin scheme for women, but daughters of sisters are not safe.In an apparent reference to the rape and murder of a doctor in Kolkata, where the Mamata Banerjee-led government has come under fire, the Sena (UBT) chief said politics was being done over crime against women by targeting certain states.The former chief minister claimed the school where the girls were allegedly sexually abused was linked to BJP leaders. ""The case should be fast-tracked, and the victims should be ensured speedy justice,"" he said.Leaders of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) parties like Congress, Nationalist Congress Party (SP) and Shiv Sena (UBT), besides Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, attacked the government on the incident in the home district of chief minister Eknath Shinde.Nationalist Congress Party (SP) working president Supriya Sule said the incident is “very shocking and serious” and the state home department must take note of the citizens’ anger.“Citizens are demanding strict action against the murderer who committed this heinous act. The anger of the citizens is very right and the home department needs to take note of their anger,” urged Sule.She called upon the Thane Police to thoroughly investigate the (accused) person and take strict action against him.“Apart from this, a case should also be registered against the management of the institution who tried to suppress this matter,” demanded Sule.Congress leader of the opposition in the assembly, Vijay Wadettiwar called up Thane Police Commissioner Ashutosh Dumbare and demanded the suspension of the woman police official who reportedly made the victim’s parents sit in the police station for nearly 12 hours before taking their complaint last week.“This case must be taken up by a fast track court to hear it in three months and the accused must be given the death sentence,” said Wadettiwar.Congress MP and Mumbai president Varsha Gaikwad said, “The incident of inhumane and cruel treatment of the girls is mind-numbing”, and the issue of women’s safety has become very serious during the Shinde government, while its silence was unbearable.“The number of crimes against women is also increasing, but the state Home Minister and the government are not at all concerned. It is not enough to simply say 'Ladaki Baheen' and sit with rakhi in hand. If the government wants to preserve the true relationship with the sisters, it also has to fulfil the responsibility of keeping them safe as a true brother,” pointed out Gaikwad.SS (UBT)’s Deputy Leader Sushma Andhare questioned why schools without CCTVs and ‘sevikas’ (women assistants) were given permission and said “Ladki Bahin can wait, we need ‘Surakshit Bahin’ (secure sister) first”.Claiming that there is a complete collapse of law and order in the state, SS (UBT)’s spokesperson Kishore Tiwari demanded the immediate sacking of deputy CM Fadnavis and forming an SIT to probe the shocking case.“The law and order does not exist due to corruption and cash deals to get desired police postings… The CM is like a rubber stamp as there's a complete collapse of law and order due to hostile corruption and cash and getting the desired posting. The BJP is responsible for the present messy situation,” said Tiwari.Demanding the resignation of both the CM and deputy CM, VBA Chief Spokesperson Siddharth Mokle said the incident is a blot on humanity but the government is only obsessed about winning the next elections at all costs.The Maharashtra government on Tuesday ordered the setting up of a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the alleged sexual abuse of two girl students of a school in Badlapur. The SIT will be headed by Inspector General of Police-rank officer Aarti Singh, deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, who heads the home department, stated on X.Fadnavis stated he has directed the Thane Police Commissioner to prepare a proposal to try the case in a fast-track court.Maharashtra government ordered the suspension of three police officials, including a senior inspector, for alleged dereliction of duty in the investigation of the sexual abuse of two girls at a school in Badlapur, amid widespread protests.""The orders of immediate suspension of the senior police inspector, assistant sub-inspector and head constable attached to Badlapur police station for the dereliction of duty have been issued,"" deputy chief minister and home minister Devendra Fadnavis posted on X.Fadnavis said the state government has appointed Arti Singh, an inspector general-rank Indian Police Service (IPS) officer, to conduct the inquiry.""It will be our endeavour to inquire into the incident at the earliest. We want to file the chargesheet in this case as soon as possible and place the matter before a fast-track court for hearing,"" he said.""Our police department will make complete efforts to get such a barbaric and inhuman act punished immediately,"" the deputy chief minister added.He slammed the Nationalist Congress Party's (NCP) working president, Supriya Sule, and former Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray for allegedly politicising the issue.""It is unfortunate that the opposition seeks to gain political benefit out of such incidents. The opposition is devoid of any empathy. The politics of the opposition is coming to the fore,"" the senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader said.He said Thackeray should behave like a statesman and not stoop too low and indulge in politics on a sensitive issue of sexual abuse.Meanwhile, Maharashtra chief minister Eknath Shinde has directed the police to invoke the attempt to rape charge against the arrested accused. The case will be fast-tracked and a special public prosecutor will be appointed, Shinde said on Tuesday.""I have spoken to the Thane Commissioner of Police. The accused has been arrested. I have asked the case to be fast-tracked and book the accused under the charges of attempt to rape and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act,"" he said.The chief minister warned of legal action if the management of the school is found negligent or complicit, the chief minister's office (CMO) stated.During a meeting with education minister Deepak Kesarkar, Shinde proposed several measures aimed at improving school safety and preventing future abuse like the installation of complaint boxes in every school, enhancing scrutiny of school staff who frequently interact with students, including the background checks, and establishing safe reporting mechanisms for students.Shinde appealed to demonstrating parents to exercise restraint as the rail blockade was hampering the functioning of local trains.Maharashtra education minister Deepak Kesarkar said, ""We will see to it that the existing safety measures are further strengthened. We are issuing a circular today that CCTVs must be operational in each school. We will appoint a committee based on the Vishaka committee in schools as well. We will fast-track this case and give the strictest punishment to the accused. The school principal, the class teacher and 2 assistants have been suspended. The school also has been served a notice. A woman senior PI who delayed registering a case has been transferred but she should be suspended.""""This is a very sad incident. The entire machinery of the state education department has been mobilized. We have given instructions to four IAS officers from Pune and Mumbai. We are investigating why the CCTV was not functioning in the school. After the complaint was lodged, no action was taken, so the Senior PI has been transferred. We will bring this case to a Fast Track court and ensure the maximum punishment for the accused. Our entire department is present here, and the safety of students is our priority,"" he added.Meanwhile, a BJP MLA from the Murbad assembly constituency in Thane district, Kisan Kathore, alleged the protest at Badlapur railway station is politically motivated. He claimed agitators have come from neighbouring areas and not from Badlapur.""These demonstrators are not from Badlapur city; they have arrived from neighbouring areas such as Ulhasnagar. A comprehensive investigation is conducted against the school principal and staff members who allegedly attempted to suppress the incident,"" Kathore said.He alleged some individuals associated with political parties had put up banners in Badlapur rejecting the funds offered under the ""Mukhyamantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana"", but are now seeking justice. ""The protesters at Badlapur station are not locals. They are residents of neighbouring areas,"" he added.The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) on Tuesday demanded a detailed report from Maharashtra authorities on the incident of alleged sexual assault on two four-year-old girls in a school washroom in Thane district and the ""delay"" in filing an FIR in the matter. The Commission took suo motu cognisance of the case on a day thousands of protesters blocked railway tracks at Badlapur station in Thane and stormed the local school building, where the alleged incident had occurred.The accused, who was employed to clean the girls' toilets, is alleged to have victimised the children on August 12-13, 2024.The NHRC has issued notices to the chief secretary and the Director General of Police of Maharashtra, demanding a detailed report on the incident within two weeks.The Commission's directive calls for clarity on the reasons behind the reported ""12-hour delay"" in registering the First Information Report (FIR) after the parents lodged a complaint with the police.Parents of the victims have raised concerns over why a female staff member was not assigned to clean the girls' washroom, a standard practice that could have potentially prevented such an incident.The Commission has emphasised the need to investigate this aspect thoroughly.In addition to the status of the FIR, the NHRC has requested details about the health and well-being of the two victims, including whether they have received any counselling or support services from the authorities or the school management.The NHRC has also asked for information on the measures being taken or proposed to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future.The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) will dispatch a team to Thane in Maharashtra following the alleged sexual assault of a four-year-old girl in a school in the district. The apex child rights body has also questioned the delay in the registration of an FIR in the matter. The incident has sparked outrage, particularly due to a reported delay by the local police in lodging the First Information Report (FIR).NCPCR Chairperson Priyank Kanoongo took to social media to express his distress over the incident and announced that a team would be dispatched to investigate the matter.He questioned why police made the victim's parents wait for 12 hours to get an FIR lodged.""I will personally monitor the investigation, and ensure that all negligent police officers are punished,"" Kanoongo said in a post on X.A woman journalist covering the protest over the Badlapur sexual abuse incident alleged on Tuesday that a local leader of the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena made an offensive remark, saying she was acting 'as if she herself had been raped.'Waman Mhatre, former mayor of Badlapur who belongs to the party led by the Maharashtra chief minister, however, claimed that his remark was misconstrued.The woman journalist, who works for a Marathi daily, told a news channel that as she was covering the protests on the tracks, Mhatre confronted her, making 'vulgar' gestures. She was reporting on the incident in such a way 'as if she herself had been raped,' she quoted Mhatre as saying.""Such behavior was highly unacceptable and caused me agony. However, I responded by asserting that my reporting is based on facts,"" the woman added.Mhatre claimed that his comments were misconstrued. ""I was insisting that they provide factual information to the protesters. The word 'rape' was consistently used. I was asking them to get factual information, but it was misconstrued,"" he said.The Mumbai Press Club condemned Mhatre's statements and demanded that chief minister Shinde take action against him. Mhatre ""demonstrated blatant disregard for public sentiment by blaming journalists for the incident"" and asserted that the media was inciting unrest, the Press Club said in a statement.","Two four-year-old nursery students were allegedly sexually abused by a newly hired sweeper at an English medium school in Thane district.

They also claim to be living in the area for over three decades.Residents said forest officials, accompanied by police and power officials, reached the clusters of Ramdev Ka Dera, Chameli Ka Dera and Keval Krishna Ka Dera, named after the contractors who brought the to work the mines as far back as 1964, with bulldozers on Monday morning, an action they had been anticipating after receiving demolition notices on Aug 9 and 14. The locals, while asserting that they had the right to rehabilitation as per DUSIB norms , alleged that the forest department hadn't given them enough time to explore legal options.""After receiving the first notice at Ramdev Ka Dera on Aug 9, we have been apprehensive,"" said Rajendra Kumar, who works as a driver for a south Delhi family. ""I am the third generation of my family living here after my grandfather came as a labourer from Rajasthan in 1967. We have valid documents, power connection and water supply, yet are being thrown out.""The area also has a DUSIB community centre, proper roads, electric poles and piped water through two tubewells. Delhi Jal Board tankers also supply drinking water in the region because, the residents say, the groundwater is often undrinkable.After the stone mines closed, the hamlet was designated a gram sabha. However, in 1996, the area was declared forest land and part of the Ridge. In 2013, the Sonya Ghosh Vs GNCT Delhi case began and in Jan 2021, the National Green Tribunal directed Delhi govt to take measures to protect the Ridge, including clearance of encroached areas.""These clusters are among the oldest of the 675 slums enlisted under the DUSIB Act, 2010. Under that Act, houses built before 2006 can't be removed without the residents being rehabilitated,"" said activist Prakash Kumar. ""A rehab plan, a must under DUSIB norms, hasn't been prepared or shared with the Rajokri residents. So how can the forest department carry out demolitions?""Forest officials did not offer any comment on the matter. On Aug 8, the West forest division listed khasra numbers and asked the people occupying these plots to vacate them within seven days. The notice claimed the plots comprised notified reserve forest land and the houses were encroachments under the Indian Forest Act, 1927.""The forest department wants us to vacate this area but isn't interested in rehabilitating people who lose their homes,"" complained Tuntun Kumar, a union member who is in the team exploring legal options. ""They call us encroachers, which we are not. We have papers for the land; there are records that we paid for the land block.""Sher Singh, who traces his roots to Rajasthan, said, ""Our ancestors came from UP, Bihar, Rajasthan and Haryana, but we don't have villages to go back to after so many decades. Rajokri is our village where we have our temple and crematorium. Where can we go?""","The village has three clusters spread over 15 acres, with around 1,000 families living there.

"US elections 2024: In Kamala Harris’ story, her mother Shyamala Gopalan steals the show",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-elections-2024-in-kamala-harris-story-her-mother-steals-the-show-star-of-my-life/articleshow/112724376.cms,"The Truths We Hold

Kamala Harris , the Vice President of the United States, often reflects on the profound influence her mother , Shyamala Gopalan , had on her life and career. In her 2019 memoir,, Harris wrote, “Mommy, you are the star of this book because you are the reason for everything. There is no title or honor on earth I’ll treasure more than to say I am Shyamala Gopalan Harris’ daughter.”Gopalan, a prominent breast cancer researcher, passed away in 2009 at the age of 70.As per the report by the USA Today, despite her absence during Harris' rise to the vice presidency, her presence continues to be felt. “I think of her all the time,” Harris wrote. “Sometimes I look up and talk to her.”Born in 1938 in India, Gopalan was ahead of her time. At just 19, she defied cultural norms by pursuing a Ph.D in nutrition and endocrinology at the University of California, Berkeley. Her decision to move to the US was a bold one, especially for a young woman from a conservative Tamil Brahmin community. Gopalan’s determination to excel academically and professionally set a powerful example for her daughters.In a memorable anecdote from her memoir, Harris recounted a conversation with her mother during her campaign for California Attorney General. Despite being seriously ill with cancer, Gopalan’s response to Harris’ concerns was filled with unwavering support. “Mommy, these guys are saying they’re gonna kick my ass,” Harris told her. Gopalan, lying on her side, rolled over, smiled, and said nothing—knowing her daughter’s fighting spirit would prevail. “She knew who she had raised,” Harris reflected. “She knew her fighting spirit was alive and well inside me.”Gopalan’s legacy of resilience and social justice profoundly shaped Harris’ worldview. Harris often recalls her mother’s lessons, including the importance of not letting any situation get the better of you and the need to mentor others. Harris also highlighted her mother's advice on self-determination: “Don’t you let anyone tell you who you are. You tell them who you are.”Shyamala Gopalan’s impact extended beyond her daughters. Earlier this year, Indian American Impact, a voting rights and advocacy group, created the Dr. Shyamala Gopalan Harris Award for Allyship and Civil Rights in her honor. “Her legacy is a reminder that the immigrant experience is not just about personal achievement. It’s also about public service. It’s about giving back to the community, and building a path for future generations,” said Deepak Raj, co-founder of the organization.As Harris prepares for the Democratic Party’s nomination for President, she carries her mother’s memory with her. “Kamala brought Shyamala’s ashes with her,” Gopalan Balachandran, Harris’ uncle, as quoted by USA Today. “We went to Elliot’s Beach in the Bay of Bengal to immerse her ashes.”Harris' journey, deeply intertwined with her mother's legacy, continues to inspire many as she navigates her path in American politics.","Kamala Harris often reflects on the profound influence her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, had on her life and career.

Nancy Pelosi: Pelosi’s DNC stage drop sparks online frenzy: Was that toilet paper or something else?

As she walked onto the stage, a white paper-like item fell from her pants, landing conspicuously on the stage. The incident quickly ignited a flurry of online speculation and mockery, with many initially believing it to be a piece of toilet paper.Pelosi, 84, was in the midst of addressing the convention when the mysterious item made its dramatic debut. The incident occurred just as she approached the podium, prompting a wave of theories and jokes across social media . The object, which appeared to be a square piece of paper, seemed to drop from Pelosi's clothing in a way that set the internet abuzz.Social media platforms were soon flooded with comments and memes, as the viral video of the incident garnered nearly 2 million views on X (formerly Twitter). Malaysian political commentator Ian Miles Cheong shared the footage, playfully suggesting it was toilet paper. The theory quickly gained traction among some Pro-Trump commenters, who seized the opportunity to poke fun at the senior Democrat. ""Stagehands are quarrelling: ‘Who’s going to pick it up? Not me! You! No, you! Not gonna happen!’"" one user quipped.Others chimed in with their own humorous takes. “Pelosi was drunk AF and didn't realize she had toilet paper in her pants,” another user commented, while yet another joked that the paper was “the chloroform rag she used on Joe Biden ,” alluding to Pelosi’s rumoured attempts to persuade Biden to step aside from the presidential race.The intrigue surrounding the white item deepened when Vice President Kamala Harris ’ godson, Alexander Hudlin, inadvertently turned over the object minutes later, revealing it to be a more complex geometrical shape. This revelation only added to the buzz, as people tried to piece together the puzzle.A source close to Pelosi later clarified that the object was not what many had presumed. “It was note cards” that were “folded up” containing her speech, the source confirmed. The clarification aimed to dispel the humorous but inaccurate claims circulating online.Despite the commotion, Pelosi carried on with her speech, which lasted less than five minutes. She did not address the mishap, focusing instead on praising President Joe Biden for his “one of the most successful presidencies of modern times.” The incident remained a backdrop of sorts as California Democratic congressional candidate Lateefah Simon spoke, though the paper was removed before Oprah Winfrey took the stage later in the event.The moment remains a memorable part of the convention, illustrating how even the smallest mishaps can spiral into major talking points in today’s social media-driven world.","Pelosi, 84, was in the midst of addressing the convention when the mysterious item made its dramatic debut.

Obama’s call for a new chapter

A swipe at Trump’s ‘Stale act’

Praise for

Joe Biden

and Tim Walz

A convention highlight

Barack Obama energized the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday with a powerful endorsement of Kamala Harris and a sharp critique of former President Donald Trump . Addressing a cheering crowd, Obama asserted that America is ready for a new chapter under President Harris, dismissing Trump's approach as stale and ineffective.Barack Obama, America’s first Black president, urged delegates to back Harris as she seeks to make history on November 5 as the first woman and the first Black and South Asian US president.“I don’t know about you, but I’m feeling fired up!” Obama said, rallying the crowd with his characteristic enthusiasm.He praised Kamala Harris, declaring, “America is ready for a new chapter. America’s ready for a better story. We are ready for a President Kamala Harris.” Obama highlighted Harris’s dedication and hard-fought journey to success, contrasting her with Trump’s divisive rhetoric.Obama took a moment to reflect on the international stakes of the election. “By the way, that doesn’t just matter to people in this country. The rest of the world is watching to see if we can actually pull it off,” he said. “We shouldn’t be the world’s policeman, and we can’t eradicate every cruelty and injustice in the world. But America can be, must be, a force for good – discouraging conflict, fighting disease, promoting human rights, protecting the planet from climate change, defending freedom. That’s what Kamala Harris believes – and so do most Americans.”As the crowd erupted into chants of “Yes, she can!” Obama championed Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, as leaders dedicated to the working class. “In this new economy, we need a president who actually cares about the millions of people all across this country who wake up every day to do the essential, often thankless work to care for our sick and clean our streets and deliver our packages,” he said. “Kamala will be that president.”Obama did not hold back in his critique of Trump. “It’s one of the oldest tricks in politics – from a guy whose act has gotten pretty stale. We don’t need four more years of bluster and chaos. We’ve seen that movie – and we all know that the sequel’s usually worse,” Obama said.He dismissed Trump’s tenure as a series of grievances and conspiracies, referencing Trump’s fixation on crowd sizes and nicknames. “Here’s a 78-year-old billionaire who has not stopped whining about his problems since he rode down his golden escalator,” Obama quipped.Turning to Joe Biden, Obama expressed pride in his former vice president’s tenure and character. “This country will remember him as an outstanding president who defended democracy at a moment of great danger,” Obama said, adding that he was “even prouder to call him my friend.”Obama also extolled Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Biden’s running mate, for his genuine character and commitment to service. “Tim’s the kind of person who should be in politics – somebody who was born in a small town, served his country, taught kids, coached football, and took care of his neighbors,” Obama said, noting Walz’s authentic style.At 63, Barack Obama played a significant role in persuading Biden to step aside and endorse Harris. Harris, 59, has gained momentum with record-breaking fundraising and enthusiastic support.Speaking virtually from a rally in Milwaukee, Harris criticized Trump for his lack of remorse over the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade. ""I do believe, you know, bad behavior should result in a consequence. Well, we will make sure he does face a consequence and that will be at the ballot box in November,"" Harris asserted.The former president’s speech, following Michelle Obama’s heartfelt introduction, was a highlight of the convention. As the jumbotron displayed images of Tim Walz and his supportive wife Gwen, the crowd responded with enthusiasm.Michelle Obama, introduced by her husband, echoed the call for change. ""America, hope is making a comeback,"" she said, referencing her husband’s first campaign in 2008. She warned that Trump would attempt to distort Harris' truth, likening his attempts to previous efforts to discredit the Obamas. ""His limited and narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by the existence of two hardworking, highly educated, successful people who also happened to be Black,"" Michelle Obama said, prompting a strong response from the crowd.The convention also saw Republicans who have distanced themselves from Trump address the delegates. Former White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham and former Trump supporter Kyle Sweetser shared their experiences, with Grisham recounting her resignation after the January 6 Capitol attack. Republican Mayor John Giles of Mesa, Arizona, called for a return to the principles of the late Senator John McCain, emphasizing the need to move beyond Trump’s influence.Outside the convention, a protest near Chicago's Israeli consulate turned briefly violent, with a smaller group clashing with police. Most convention speakers avoided the topic of US support for Israel in the Gaza conflict, although Senator Bernie Sanders called for an end to the war and an immediate ceasefire.",Barack Obama urged delegates to back Kamala Harris as she seeks to make history on November 5 as the first woman and the first Black and South Asian US president.

The former president’s love for the fast-food chain was so pronounced that a McDonald’s in Little Rock, Arkansas, has a plaque commemorating his frequent visits during his tenure as governor.According to NBC Chicago, the plaque at the Little Rock McDonald’s reads: “Bill Clinton made regular stops at this downtown McDonald’s during his morning runs from the Arkansas governor’s mansion. Thank you for your business, Mr President.”According to the Washington Post, Clinton’s dietary habits have shifted since his presidency. After undergoing quadruple-bypass surgery, he transitioned to a mostly vegan diet, giving up his beloved McDonald’s for health reasons.Former President Donald Trump has also been known for his affinity for McDonald’s, continuing the fast-food legacy among recent presidents.","Former President Bill Clinton joked that Vice President Kamala Harris will break his record for spending the most time at McDonald's.

In 2024, the world continues to grapple with severe conflicts, political instability, and humanitarian crises, making certain regions extremely dangerous. Countries like Yemen, Afghanistan, and Sudan remain at the forefront of global concern due to ongoing conflicts that have devastated their populations and infrastructure.To explore and understand which countries face the highest levels of danger, we turn to the Global Peace Index (GPI) compiled by the Institute for Economics and Peace.The Global Peace Index (GPI) provides a critical measure of the safety and stability of nations, highlighting those most impacted by war, violence, and unrest.This non-profit organization annually evaluates 163 countries across 23 indicators, including internal conflicts, societal safety, and levels of militarization, providing a comprehensive assessment of global peace and security. Here’s the list of the most dangerous countries in the world.With a 2024 GPI score of 3.397, Yemen continues to be one of the world's most dangerous countries. Since the onset of civil conflict in 2015, the nation has been plunged into chaos, with widespread famine, disease, and infrastructure collapse exacerbating the situation.The conflict, which started as an internal struggle, has been prolonged and intensified by the involvement of neighbouring countries, each backing different factions. This has only deepened the suffering of the Yemeni people, who face unimaginable hardships daily.Sudan remains one of the most dangerous countries globally, primarily due to ongoing conflicts in regions like Darfur, South Kordofan, and Blue Nile. In 2024, these conflicts resulted in over 3,000 deaths and displaced nearly 2 million people.The humanitarian crisis is severe, with frequent attacks on civilians by government forces, opposition groups, and militias. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), approximately 14 million people in Sudan are in dire need of humanitarian aid.South Sudan, with a GPI score of 3.324, remains one of the world's most perilous countries due to ongoing civil conflict, ethnic violence, and political instability. Since gaining independence in 2011, the country has struggled to maintain peace and stability, with its citizens facing continuous threats from internal strife and external pressures.Afghanistan, with a 2024 GPI score of 3.294, continues to be one of the most dangerous countries worldwide. Decades of conflict, compounded by the Taliban's seizure of power in 2021, have left the nation in a state of constant instability.The risks of terrorism, kidnappings, and widespread violence remain high, making Afghanistan a focal point of international concern.Ukraine has witnessed a significant decline in safety and stability, particularly since the Russian invasion began in February 2022. By 2024, the conflict has claimed over 150,000 lives, with millions more displaced both internally and externally.The destruction of cities and critical infrastructure, including homes, schools, and hospitals, has created a humanitarian crisis of immense proportions.The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) continues to suffer from one of the deadliest conflicts in African history. The ongoing violence, which has spanned more than four and a half years, has resulted in more lives lost than any other conflict since World War II, according to the International Rescue Committee. The DRC remains a highly dangerous place, with widespread violence and instability threatening the lives of millions.In 2024, Russia's GPI score of 3.249 reflects the nation's increasing danger, exacerbated by the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. Internally, Russia faces significant challenges, including organized crime and corruption, which undermine law and order.Additionally, environmental concerns, such as industrial accidents and pollution, pose substantial health risks to the population.Since the onset of its civil war in 2011, Syria has been one of the world's most dangerous countries. The conflict has devastated infrastructure, leaving buildings, roads, hospitals, and schools in ruins.The humanitarian situation is dire, with over 13 million Syrians in need of assistance, including 6.6 million internally displaced. Food insecurity is rampant, and the healthcare system is in disarray, with many hospitals destroyed or operating at minimal capacity.Mali has been embroiled in armed conflict since January 2012, when Tuareg rebels seized control of the northern territory, declaring the independent nation of Azawad by April of that year. The situation escalated further with a military coup in March 2012, deepening the turmoil in the region. Today, Mali remains one of the most dangerous countries, with ongoing violence and instability threatening the safety of its citizens","The Global Peace Index (GPI) provides a critical measure of the safety and stability of nations.

Advisers’ concerns over personal attacks

Controversy

overshadows policy

Donald Trump , though not present in Chicago, has a noticeable influence on the Democratic National Convention (DNC) events taking place there. Despite his aides' claims that he isn't interested in watching the DNC , a senior campaign official confirmed that the former president is indeed following the events and is irritated by the attacks against him, the BBC reported.While Trump’s campaign strategy initially aimed to focus on the economy, the border, and crime through a series of rallies , nightly anti-Trump speeches at the DNC have made it challenging for him to stay on message, with his campaign now seemingly directed by crowd reactions and his own impulses.Trump has scheduled rallies in Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina, and Arizona, each aiming to highlight political and economic topics. However, consistent personal attacks against him during the DNC have led him to ask his supporters whether he should remain policy-focused or respond to the attacks. At a rally in North Carolina, Trump addressed the issue directly with his audience.""They always say, 'Sir, please stick to policy, don't get personal'... and yet [the Democrats are] getting personal all night long, these people. Do I still have to stick to policy?"" Trump asked. His supporters responded enthusiastically for him to go personal, to which he joked, ""My advisers are fired!"" He then indicated his intent to focus on policy but also not overlook the attacks.This approach is causing concern for his campaign advisers who wish for Trump to focus on policy issues rather than engaging in controversial personal attacks. One adviser, speaking anonymously, mentioned that their primary challenge is keeping Trump concentrated on policy issues and away from personal controversies.""It doesn't matter what he talks about for 45 minutes,"" the adviser said. ""One comment or answer to a question gives the left all they need to change the subject.""Trump’s tendencies to deviate into personal attacks were visible when he criticised Democratic Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro on social media late Wednesday night after Shapiro's speech at the DNC.""The highly overrated Jewish Governor of the Great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro, made a really bad and poorly delivered speech,"" Trump wrote. ""I have done more for Israel than any President…Shapiro has done nothing for Israel, and never will.""The inclusion of Shapiro's religious background drew attention and was highlighted by US morning shows as a racial dog whistle. Similar sentiments emerged after the Obamas criticised Trump at the DNC. At his North Carolina rally, Trump made a pointed response.""Did you see Barack Hussein Obama last night?"" Trump said. ""He was taking shots at your president. And so was Michelle.""The usage of Obama's middle name, ""Hussein,"" is often interpreted as an attempt to provoke racial animosity. Such instances of racial innuendo complicate the efforts of Trump’s campaign advisers, who find that controversy tends to overshadow substantive policy discussions.With Trump’s campaign strategy appearing to fluctuate based on crowd responses and the personal attacks flying at the DNC, his advisers are left grappling with a candidate who thrives on controversy. This presents an ongoing challenge to maintain a consistent focus on policy and attacking his opponent's weaknesses rather than personal back-and-forths.","Donald Trump has a noticeable influence on the Democratic National Convention (DNC) events taking place in Chicago.

CHICAGO: Vice President Kamala Harris will try to redefine herself for America and draw a sharp contrast with Republican Donald Trump on Thursday when she accepts the Democratic Party's 2024 presidential nomination.""In many ways, Donald Trump is an unserious man. But the consequences of putting Donald Trump back in the White House are extremely serious,"" Harris will say, according to advance excerpts of the speech.The four-day Democratic National Convention has drawn some of the biggest names in politics and music, including megastar Beyonce who will perform on Thursday, entertainment website TMZ reported, citing multiple sources.Harris emerged as the Democratic candidate little more than a month ago when allies of President Joe Biden , 81, forced him to quit the race. If successful, she stands to make history as the first woman elected U.S. president.Harris, 59, will talk about her life as the daughter of a Jamaican father and Indian mother and lay out her plans to tackle rising costs and advance personal freedoms, including abortion rights, aides said.Alluding to the divisive rhetoric Trump has used on the campaign trail, Harris promised to ""be a president for all Americans.""A former California attorney general, Harris' presidential ambitions were apparent for years, but they had been undermined by her own shaky 2020 campaign and bumps along the way of her nearly four years as vice president.""With this election, our nation has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism and divisive battles of the past.

Victims of gun violence, including former U.S. Representative Gabby Giffords, will also appear.Former U.S. Representative Adam Kinzinger, one of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach then-President Trump, is one of several Republicans to speak at the convention for Harris and against Trump.Over the last three days, Democrats have sought to define themselves as the voice of American values from small towns to overseas.Her forceful stump speeches have been met by a surge in enthusiasm from voters ahead of the Nov. 5 election. Harris has raised a record-breaking $500 million in a month and has narrowed the gap or taken the lead against Trump in many opinion polls of battleground states that will decide the election.Outside the convention center, thousands of Palestinian supporters gathered to protest U.S. support for Israel as it wages war in Gaza. The issue is one of the most divisive among Democrats and got little attention at the convention, which could hurt them at the polls.Harris has yet to articulate much of her vision for the country, and Republicans say Democrats have spent more time attacking Trump than elaborating on how they would govern.Harris has spent weeks on the speech, making changes to drafts from lead speechwriter Adam Frankel, including during campaign trips on Air Force Two.Aides say she will discuss her plans to cut taxes for most Americans, boost the housing supply and ban what she calls ""price gouging"" by grocers. Her campaign has also proposed raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%.The speech will include elements of foreign policy along with stories of women affected by abortion bans and other curbs on reproductive rights, aides and advisers said.Trump, campaigning this week in a handful of battleground states, accused Harris at an Arizona stop along the U.S.-Mexico border of not doing enough to prevent illegal immigration.","Vice President Kamala Harris will accept the Democratic Party's 2024 presidential nomination.

Kennedy's appeal among independents falters

Family legacy fails to propel Kennedy forward

Legal challenges add to Kennedy’s troubles

Recent polls indicate that Republicans have a more favourable opinion of independent presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr compared to Democrats . Allies of former President Donald Trump are urging Kennedy to drop out and endorse Trump, as Kennedy's support wanes amid recent political shifts, including President Joe Biden’s withdrawal and Vice President Kamala Harris' nomination.According to the Associated Press, polls show that Kennedy's presence doesn't significantly impact support for either major-party candidate, as his approval now hovers in the mid-single digits.Kennedy, the 70-year-old son of former US Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, is struggling to solidify his stance in a complex race. He plans to speak in Phoenix on Friday about ""the present historical moment and his path forward,"" following his running mate's discussions about potentially endorsing Trump instead.In a July AP-NORC poll conducted before Biden exited the race, Americans were evenly divided in their views of Kennedy, reflecting a decline from February when more people viewed him favourably. About 2 in 10 US adults lacked enough information about Kennedy to form an opinion in the most recent poll.Republicans are more inclined than Democrats and independents to view Kennedy favourably. Among those who have a positive impression of Kennedy, 52 per cent also have a favourable view of Trump, compared to 37 per cent for Harris.However, Kennedy has not been successful in winning over political independents. Despite running as an independent, about 4 in 10 independents remain uninformed about him, and those who do have an opinion are equally divided between favourable and unfavourable views.Kennedy’s initial appeal stemmed from being an alternative to Biden and Trump, a matchup many voters hoped to avoid. A Pew Research Center poll in July found that half of Kennedy supporters backed him mainly because he wasn't Biden or Trump, while about 30 per cent were drawn by his characteristics or policies.Harris’ elevation to the Democratic nomination seems to have further hurt Kennedy’s campaign. An August Pew poll suggests that Harris gained support from some women and non-white voters who might have otherwise supported Kennedy.Kennedy's family name has been a significant factor in his appeal. Many Democrats considered supporting him due to his connections to the Kennedy family, including his father and uncle, former President John F. Kennedy. Despite this, numerous Kennedy family members endorsed Biden before his withdrawal from the race.John F Kennedy remains highly regarded across party lines, with a Gallup retrospective approval rating revealing that 9 in 10 Americans approve of his presidency. This admiration spans Democrats, independents, and Republicans alike.Adding to his political difficulties, a New York judge ruled last week that Kennedy should not appear on the ballot in the state due to a ""sham"" address listed on nominating petitions. Kennedy has appealed this decision and faces several similar challenges across the country.With diminishing support and increasing complications, Kennedy's political future appears uncertain as his campaign contemplates the next steps.","Republicans are more inclined than Democrats and independents to view Kennedy favourably.

The backlash from these comments has ignited a broader discussion on the bullying that children with disabilities frequently endure.Advocates have condemned the online vitriol directed at Gus, highlighting that children with disabilities are significantly more likely to be bullied than their peers. Katy Neas, CEO of The Arc of the United States, called the attacks ""a painful reminder"" of the daily challenges these children face, emphasizing the long-term impact bullying can have on their academic and social development.Kristen Eccleston, a former special education teacher, noted that children with learning disabilities are often targeted because they may struggle with communication or social skills. She stressed the importance of surrounding children like Gus with support and fostering open discussions about emotions to help them develop resilience.The bullying incident has also drawn attention to the role of social media in enabling such behavior. Anne Strober, a parent of a child with autism, expressed her dismay at the cruelty displayed online, pointing out the anonymity that emboldens bullies. Strober emphasized that children, particularly those with disabilities, should be off-limits to such attacks.While the Walz campaign has declined to comment on the incident, the impact of this bullying has resonated beyond the political arena, serving as a stark reminder of the challenges faced by children with disabilities in an increasingly digital world.","Tim Walz's 17-year-old son, Gus, has a nonverbal learning disorder, anxiety, and ADHD.
