Donald Trump Jr has a stark warning for any Republican who votes against Tulsi Gabbard,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-jr-has-a-stark-warning-for-any-republican-who-votes-against-tulsi-gabbard/articleshow/117525757.cms,"2020 Democratic Debate - SNL

Why Gabbard has an uphill battle



Donald Trump Jr. issued a stark warning to Republican senators ahead of the confirmation hearing for Tulsi Gabbard, President Trump's nominee for Director of National Intelligence (DNI). In a tweet, Trump Jr wrote, ‚ÄúAny Republican Senator who votes against @TulsiGabbard deserves a primary. No more Deep State b******!!!!‚ÄùThe Senate Intelligence Committee is set to hold a hearing on January 30 to assess Gabbard‚Äôs qualifications. The hearing follows delays from Senate Democrats, who cited incomplete background checks, ethics disclosures, and other paperwork on the controversial nominee.If confirmed, Gabbard‚Äîa former Democrat congresswoman‚Äîwould oversee all 18 US intelligence agencies. However, her nomination has sparked sharp debate in Washington. Critics point to her lack of intelligence experience and her controversial relationships with US adversaries.Gabbard faced scrutiny for meeting with Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad in 2017, shortly after allegations emerged that Assad used chemical weapons against his own people. She has also been a vocal defender of whistleblower Edward Snowden and has echoed Russian President Vladimir Putin‚Äôs rhetoric regarding the war in Ukraine.Despite these concerns, Gabbard has sought to build bipartisan support, notably reversing her stance on Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). Once critical of the program, Gabbard now supports its use to allow US intelligence agencies to monitor foreign nationals abroad without a warrant.‚ÄúIf confirmed as DNI, I will uphold Americans‚Äô Fourth Amendment rights while maintaining vital national security tools like Section 702 to ensure the safety and freedom of the American people,‚Äù Gabbard said in a statement earlier this month.Her shift on Section 702 has garnered support from prominent Republican lawmakers, including Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Tom Cotton (R-Ark.).The upcoming hearing is expected to be contentious, as senators from both parties weigh Gabbard's qualifications and past actions against her recent pledges to support national security initiatives.Tulsi Gabbard's lack of formal intelligence experience is a major concern for her nomination as Director of National Intelligence (DNI), given the critical oversight role of managing the US's 18 intelligence agencies. While her military and congressional background is notable, critics argue it may not sufficiently prepare her for the complexities of the intelligence domain.Her foreign policy stances have drawn bipartisan criticism. Gabbard's 2017 meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, known for human rights abuses, and her controversial comments on US-funded biolabs in Ukraine, perceived as echoing Russian propaganda, have raised serious questions about her judgment.Gabbard‚Äôs perceived sympathies toward adversarial nations, including Russia and Syria, have further fueled skepticism about her ability to provide unbiased intelligence assessments. These perceptions stem from her public statements and diplomatic interactions that some view as overly conciliatory.Read: The obscure cult that could ruin Tulsi Gabbard's chances The most contentious issue is her association with the Science of Identity Foundation (SIF), a religious organization described by critics as cult-like. Allegations that SIF leader Chris Butler exerted influence over her political career raise concerns about potential undue external influence in her decision-making.Her shifting political allegiances, including her departure from the Democratic Party and endorsement of Donald Trump, have raised eyebrows. This evolution in her political stance has alienated members of both parties, complicating her confirmation prospects.Ethical and financial concerns have also emerged. Delays in her confirmation hearings are attributed to incomplete ethics paperwork, and scrutiny of her financial disclosures, including media earnings and book deals, has sparked questions about potential conflicts of interest.Bipartisan opposition presents a significant hurdle for Gabbard‚Äôs nomination. Senators from both sides, including Republican Susan Collins and Democrat Tammy Duckworth, have voiced reservations, reflecting widespread unease about her suitability for the DNI role.Public and intelligence community skepticism adds to the challenges. Figures like John Bolton have openly criticised her nomination, citing her controversial past and perceived vulnerabilities, which many argue make her unfit to manage the nation‚Äôs intelligence operations.","Tulsi Gabbard's nomination for Director of National Intelligence (DNI) has sparked sharp debate in Washington.

JD Vance Pete Hegseth: What JD Vance said after voting tie-breaker for Pete Hegseth; Elon Musk reacts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-jd-vance-said-after-voting-tie-breaker-for-pete-hegseth-elon-musk-reacts/articleshow/117557146.cms,"JD Vance had to cast the tie-breaker vote for Pete Hegseth's senate confirmation.

Hegseth became Trump's most controversial pick



After three Republicans Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitch McConnel of Kentucky voted against Pete Hegseth , Vice President JD Vance had to step in and vote to get Hegseth confirmed by the Senate as the defense secretary of the new Trump administration. The final vote, 51-50, was the smaller margin for a defense secretary's confirmation since the position was created in 1947. JD Vance was the Ohio senator before he became the vice president and he was forced to cast a tie-breaking vote -- being only the second vice president in US history to cast a tie-breaking vote for a cabinet official. Former vice president Mike Pence helped confirm education secretary Betsy Devos by offering the final vote in 2017.""I though I was done voting in the senate,"" JD Vance wrote as he had to again do a senator's job for Hegseth. Elon Musk reacted to JD Vance's statement with a 'tears of joy' smiley.‚ÄúThis is for the troops. For the warriors. For our country,‚Äù Hegseth wrote in his first comment after getting confirmed. ‚ÄúAmerica First. Every day. We will never back down.‚ÄùAfter Matt Gaetz withdrew his nomination, Pete Hegseth became the most controversial pick of Donald Trump though Trump defended his choice. A former military person, a former anchor of Fox News, Pete Hegseth was accused of sexual assault, alcohol abuse. Hegseth refuted the allegations and said the sex was consensual but he was later blackmailed into paying the woman. On alcohol abuse, Hegseth said he never had a drinking problem but he's ready to quit drinking once he becomes the defense secretary.Ahead of the confirmation, Hegseth's former sister-in-law, ex-wife of his brother, claimed that he was abusive in his marriage with his second wife and Samantha Hegseth feared for her life. But Samantha issued a statement saying that there was never any physical abuse.None of the three Republicans who voted against confirmation cited the affidavit or the allegations of personal misconduct as a reason for a decision to oppose Hegseth, though Murkowski said they ""do nothing to quiet my concerns."" Opponents of Hegseth's confirmation had hoped to win over a fourth Republican, Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina who finally voted in favor of Hegseth.","JD Vance had to cast the tie-breaking vote for Pete Hegseth's senate confirmation.

A wave of rumours surrounding former US President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama has taken social media by storm, fueled by discussions of a possible separation and an alleged connection between Barack Obama and actress Jennifer Aniston . Amid this, Megyn Kelly, the host of The Megyn Kelly Show , addressed the rumours and said ""it would be a political earthquake"" if it were true.Kelly's social media posts on X and Instagram rapidly spread, drawing attention to the potential consequences of such a separation. ""I don't know whether it is true,"" she said, ""but if it is, it truly would be a political earthquake in Democratic circles, never mind America.""In her video, Kelly further emphasised the rarity of presidential divorces, saying ''I don't remember a presidential divorce in modern history.''A post on X has added fuel to the fire, claiming that Jennifer Aniston is romantically involved with Barack Obama. The post alleged that a friend of Aniston revealed the relationship during a casual conversation at a gathering. ""He's with Jennifer Aniston. My old manager, now a friend, is connected to her inner circle. At a gathering with Jennifer's friends, the affair came up casually -- Jennifer herself admitted it. They were sitting with a psychic, which makes it sound surreal, but it's definitely not a secret among her closest friends,"" the message read.The message has since gone viral, sparking heated debates and widespread speculation. Social media users were quick to point out that the rumours align with earlier tabloid claims, despite Aniston's public denial during an October appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live. Laughing off a magazine cover story suggesting a romance with Barack Obama, Aniston called the claims ""absolutely untrue"" but joked that she wasn't offended by them.Speculation about a possible split intensified when Michelle Obama was conspicuously absent from major events, such as the funeral of former President Jimmy Carter.Her team later explained that she was on an extended vacation in Hawaii during the funeral. Despite this clarification, reports claiming she has distanced herself from Washington and spends limited time with Barack have fuelled the rumours further.As the rumours continue to swirl, neither Barack nor Michelle Obama has commented publicly on the matter. Similarly, Jennifer Aniston has not addressed the latest claims.","Megyn Kelly addresses rumours linking Barack Obama to Jennifer Aniston.

Sports media personal Jason Whitlock commented on the rumors of former president Barack Obama and his wife Michelle getting divorced and said he always considered this marriage a political one. ""Barack Obama needed a Black wife to be the president and there were people who wanted him to be the president. So he had a very political marriage with Michelle Obama.

Both were read as a political snub to Trump from Michelle but at the same time speculations are rife that Barack and Michelle are not together anymore and Barack Obama is dating Jennifer Aniston.Several prominent people like Megyn Kelly, Meghan McCain said they heard these rumors from highly placed sources. Meanwhile, a social media DM purportedly written by someone in Aniston's circle went viral as it claimed that everyone in Jen's friends' circle knows about it as Aniston herself admitted it.The viral post has been linked to someone acquainted with Jennifer Aniston, and it has yet to be refuted by anyone.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday expressed his gratitude to US President Donald Trump on Sunday for what he described as providing Israel with ""tools"" to defend itself. This came after the US president reportedly authorised the transfer of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel.The US administration under Joe Biden had previously halted the delivery of these heavy munitions last year, voicing concerns over their potential use in densely populated Gaza during a possible Israeli ground offensive, warning such actions could lead to major humanitarian consequences.""Thank you, President Trump, for keeping your promise to give Israel the tools it needs to defend itself, confront our common enemies, and secure a future of peace and prosperity,"" Netanyahu said in a video statement.Israeli foreign minister Gideon Saar also commended Trump for what he called a ""crucial defence shipment"" to Israel, although neither official elaborated on the specifics of the approval.On Saturday, Trump confirmed that a ""lot of things"" were now being delivered to Israel, claiming they had been delayed under Biden‚Äôs administration. ""A lot of things that were ordered and paid for by Israel, but have not been sent by Biden, are now on their way!"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.Reports suggest Trump directed the defence department to lift the hold placed by Biden on the shipment of heavy bombs. During his presidency, Trump often emphasised his strong support for Israel, calling himself its ""best friend in the White House,"" a sentiment frequently echoed by Netanyahu.The relationship between Trump and Netanyahu, however, experienced a strain after Netanyahu congratulated Biden on his 2020 election victory, a move Trump reportedly considered disloyal, given his baseless claims of election fraud.Meanwhile, a fragile truce in the Gaza conflict, which began after Hamas‚Äôs attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, continues to hold.Over the weekend, Israel and Hamas exchanged more hostages and Palestinian prisoners as part of ongoing efforts to stabilise the situation.","US President Donald Trump reportedly authorised the transfer of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel.

The Brazilian government slammed Washington after dozens of immigrants from the US arrived in handcuffs following Donald Trump's crackdown on irregular migration and mass deportation.Brazil foreign ministry called the incident a ""flagrant disregard"" of Brazilian citizens rights and demanded an explanation over the ""degrading treatment of passengers on the flight"".""The indiscriminate use of handcuffs and shackles violates the terms of the agreement with the US, which foresees the dignified, respectful, and humane treatment of repatriates,"" the ministry said in a statement.""The Brazilian government will shorten the time of its nationals' stay in US detention centers for irregular immigration, once they no longer have the possibility of appeal.

80 years after Auschwitz: Memory culture in Germany,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/80-years-after-auschwitz-memory-culture-in-germany/articleshow/117589203.cms,"(AP photo)

What is German 'remembrance culture'?



Remembrance and commemoration: threatened by the right



Is the culture of remembrance failing?



Culture of remembrance does not (automatically) combat antisemitism



One ‚Äì or many cultures of remembrance?



Remembrance remains important



Outside the German Bundestag, flags are flying at half-mast, and inside, wreaths have been placed at the speaker's lectern. Many members of parliament are dressed in black, as are many guests. Speeches are given, and there is devout applause.Every year since 1996, this is how the victims of the Nazis have been memorialized at the Bundestag on January 27 ‚Äì a date internationally known as Holocaust Remembrance Day. It marks the anniversary of the 1945 liberation of the Auschwitz concentration and extermination camps. This act of commemoration is central to Germany 's ""culture of remembrance"".There are more than 300 memorial sites and Nazi documentation centers in the country. Schoolchildren learn about National Socialism in history lessons. Some of them also visit former concentration camps, where memorials teach them about the atrocities committed by the Nazis.As a nation, Germany experienced large-scale war crimes trials, such as the Auschwitz trials. German companies have traced their own historical involvement in Nazi crimes. Even to this day, elderly wardens of Nazi killing centers are still on trial.Holocaust Remembrance Day is a reminder of the darkest chapter in German history. Nazi Germany sparked World War II , with its many millions of deaths, and was responsible for the systematic murder of six million European Jews, as well as hundreds of thousands of other victims of Nazi terror: Sinti and Roma were targeted, as were political opponents, homosexuals and people with disabilities.Political scientist and journalist Saba-Nur Cheema describes it thus: ""Remembrance culture is a collective knowledge about ‚Äì and remembrance of ‚Äì the past. In Germany's case, the memory of the Holocaust is central, as well as an examination of National Socialism."" Other themes have become increasingly important in recent years, such as East Germany's postwar dictatorship, and Germany's role as a colonial power.Young people might think that Germany always cultivated a culture of remembrance.However, the attorney general who brought the criminal acts in Auschwitz to trial in Frankfurt in the face of great resistance, Fritz Bauer, is reputed to have said in the 1960s: ""Enemy territory begins when I leave my office."" Bauer was Jewish. He only survived the Nazi era by fleeing to Sweden.Holocaust Remembrance Day for the victims of National Socialism was only instituted in Germany in 1996. It has never been designated a public holiday.The commemoration of Nazi crimes has often been targeted with hostility ‚Äì especially by the extreme right, and right-wing populists in Germany. Jens Christian Wagner , Director of the Buchenwald and Mittelbau-Dora Memorial, a former Nazi concentration camp near Weimar, has taken a clear stance against the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party in Thuringia. He has said in the past that the party has far-right elements ‚Äì and has written on X that he received threats.""Almost all memorial sites face vandalism and Holocaust denial. But you also see the debate intensifying locally,"" says Veronika Hager from the Remembrance, Responsibility and Future (EVZ) Foundation, part of whose mission is to keep the memory of National Socialist persecution alive. ""Statements we would have rejected ten years ago as relatively extreme in society as a whole, are now much more popular.""AfD leader Alice Weidel recently made the following statement during a TV interview: ""There is no doubt that Adolf Hitler was an antisemitic socialist ‚Äì and antisemitism is primarily left-wing."" That aligns with earlier statements made by AfD colleagues, such as former head Alexander Gauland, who famously played down the Nazi era as simply ""bird poop in history.""""The goal is to soften up the situation, so that we end up not even talking about what happened. The danger is that the threat posed by right-wing nationalist groups could then become intangible and no longer concrete,"" says Cheema.Michel Friedman is one of many journalists who, for years, have been drawing attention to growing antisemitism and racism. He is highly critical of the current ""culture of remembrance"". In an interview with the German news magazine Der Spiegel he said: ""If we had done our homework, this shameless and brutal hatred of Jews would not be rampant.""For him, as well as for Jewish organizations and associations in Germany, the ""culture of remembrance"" is too ritualized, too anchored in the past: ""As important as it is to deal with the dead Jews: Our responsibility must lie with the living Jews. And life in Germany is not good for them.""In recent years, the number of incidents and attacks attributed as antisemitic have risen in Germany. For some, this proves that this nation's ""culture of remembrance"" has failed. The country's culture of remembrance and the protection of Jewish life are often considered intrinsically linked: Lessons from the past are meant to produce responsibility today. However, Joseph Wilson , an expert on ""Acting against antisemitism"" at the EVZ Foundation says that such an assumption expects the culture of remembrance to produce something it cannot.""A culture of remembrance is not the same thing as preventing and combating antisemitism,"" says Wilson. The compassion one might feel while visiting a memorial site does not automatically translate into the present day, and it does not lead to people recognizing antisemitic codes and conspiracy theories in society.""Instead, we have to realize that our antisemitism prevention concepts have failed in parts,"" he said.Many aspects of Germany's culture of remembrance have been discussed and debated. Historians have disputed the singularity of Nazi crimes, for example, and there have been discussions in newspapers. The massacre by Hamas on October 7, 2023, and the ensuing war on Gaza, with its tens of thousands of deaths, represent another schism ‚Äì these events exposed a fracture in German society.For example, the phrase ""Never again is now"" can have radically differently meanings in Germany today. The slogan was generally used to express the sentiment that the Nazi crimes must never happen again. Many people interpret it as an expression of solidarity with Jews and Israel. However, the same slogan has also been shouted in solidarity with Palestinians at pro-Palestinian demonstrations.))Ever since Angela Merkel's famous speech at the Israeli parliament in 2008, when she declared Israel's security to be ""a reason of state for Germany"", support for Israel has often been understood to be part of Germany's responsibility ‚Äì part of its culture of remembrance. For some here, that means its culture of remembrance is non-inclusive, is not designed for today's mixed immigrant society.Saba-Nur Cheema disagrees: ""I wouldn't say that it wasn't designed for that. Because civil society itself shapes a culture of remembrance."" Germany's full support for Israel at the start of the Gaza war, however, which it justified with its own history, was sharply criticized, ""including by many young immigrants."" Cheema says they posed questions like: ""Why are Palestinians suffering in this way now?"" Indeed, ""it's not a bad question to ask,"" she added.Cheema believes the slogan, ""Free Palestine from German Guilt!"", often chanted at protests, is primarily a political message and not an attack on the culture of remembrance. The Research and Information Center on Antisemitism (RIAS), on the other hand, assesses the slogan in a report as a ""desire to draw a line under the Nazi past.""Discussions like these are perhaps a sign that there are many ""cultures of remembrance"" in Germany ‚Äì not just one.Veronika Hager from the EVZ Foundation suggests one way to move forward: ""There are so many things we can specifically examine in our daily environment. For instance, company trainees could review their own firm's activities during the Nazi era, or one could find out which residents in specific houses were murdered. Such activities could be undertaken with young people, whether they have an international background, or not.""What is generally little discussed in Germany are the biographies of perpetrators in one's own family. Journalist Michel Friedman, who is Jewish, once said, ""You know, there are millions of contemporary witnesses! Look what your grandparents, great-aunts and great-uncles did!""That could perhaps be the next step in the development of Germany's culture of remembrance. ""I don't ever want to get to the point where we say: 'So, now we have the perfect culture of remembrance,' and put a checkmark beside it,"" says Veronika Hager. ""For me, it's always something discursive that moves and develops.""","Remembrance culture is a collective knowledge about ‚Äì and remembrance of ‚Äì the past. In Germany's case, the memory of the Holocaust is central, as well as an examination of National Socialism. Other themes have become increasingly important in recent years, such as East Germany's postwar dictatorship.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117589226,imgsize-880402,width-400,resizemode-4/117589226.jpg"
Slovakia's peaceful anti-government protests grow nationwide,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/slovakias-peaceful-anti-government-protests-grow-nationwide/articleshow/117588569.cms,"Fighting for democracy ‚Äî again

Talk of an alleged coup

Coup claim roundly rejected by protesters

60,000 take part in Bratislava alone

A 'paranoid' prime minister

After Prime Minister Robert Fico alleged there were plans to escalate anti-government protests into an attempted coup, Slovaks took the streets in over 20 cities to peacefully protest the government's pro-Russia policy.Late on Friday afternoon, people slowly gather at Freedom Square in Bratislava , the capital of Slovakia , to protest against the government of Prime Minister Robert Fico.The atmosphere is calm. People are streaming into the square from all directions, carrying banners and the flags of Slovakia, the EU and even NATO. Their message is clear: Slovakia belongs in Europe.This isn't the first rally of its kind being held in Bratislava. The latest series of protests began on December 23, a day after the prime minister's surprise trip to Russia, and have been held at regular intervals ever since.The protesters here agree on one thing: Slovakia does not belong to Russia. And many feel that Fico's pre-Christmas meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow was an act of treason .Slovakia has been a member of NATO since 2002, and joined the EU in 2004.The people taking part in the protests in over 20 cities across the country are peacefully demanding that Slovakia remains in these international organizations and that the government stop undermining Slovakia's international position.""I feel really disappointed by our government,"" says a 47-year-old protester named Richard who has tied an EU flag around his shoulders. ""When I was 12 years old, I took to the streets with my father, protesting against communism in November 1989, and here I am, fighting for democracy, once again,"" he tells DW.The crowd in the square is getting bigger by the minute. People of all ages have come and are joining in the chants of ""Enough of Fico,"" ""We are Europe,"" ""Shame"" and ""Treason."" Some are calling for Fico to step down as prime minister.""I feel unhappy about what is happening in this country and the people who rule it, and I want to voice my opinion,"" says 26-year-old Alexandra. She says she was not put off by the prime minister's talk of increased danger and unrest the previous day. ""I have feared for my safety ever since Fico won the election,"" she says.On Thursday, the day before demonstrations, President Peter Pellegrini convened a meeting of the state's Security Council, claiming he had been given serious information about a threat to the state's security.""The establishment of our constitution is being threatened; there are groups of people who want to escalate tension within the country and attack the institutions of government,"" said Pellegrini, adding that these groups are being coordinated from abroad.Fico made very similar claims, saying that some groups were allegedly planning a coup. ""It is an attempt to organize a typical coup in Slovakia so that the government falls and those who cannot get into power through democratic parliamentary elections come to power,"" he said.""It's very difficult to react to such delusions,"" said Lucia Stasselova , one of the organizers of the protest in Bratislava, ahead of Friday's protest. ""Nothing of what the prime minister or the president are saying is true.""""It's what all of them say,"" added Marian Kulich, another of the protest's organizers. ""Listen to Erdogan in Turkey, Orban in Hungary, Irakli Kobakhidze in Georgia, Serbia, they all use the same narrative. In my opinion, Slovakia is just one of the countries that are submitting to the Moscow regime ‚Äî thanks to our prime minister,"" he told DW.Both Stasselova and Kulich are members of the civic group Peace to Ukraine, which was set up shortly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. It is now also campaigning in support of democracy in Slovakia.""We started to organize the rallies in Bratislava, and slowly, other cities began to coordinate with us. More than 20 cities and towns are currently involved. The protests in each town are organized by different people,"" said Stasselova.Apart from a brief interruption due to a power outage on stage, the rally goes off smoothly and peacefully ‚Äî without rioting, and certainly no attempted coup.DW spoke with the organizers just a few hours before the protest, who said they were expecting around 30,000 to take part. Most media outlets have estimated that some 60,000 joined the protest in Bratislava ‚Äî four times as many as took part in the last protest two weeks ago.But demonstrations were not just restricted to the capital; the numbers taking part in other cities also increased. In Banska Bystrica, for example, attendance on Friday was up to 10,000 from 6,000 two weeks ago.Indeed, several media outlets estimated that a total of 100,000 people took to the streets of Slovakia's cities in protest on Friday.On Tuesday, Fico faced a no-confidence vote in the Slovak parliament. However, when the prime minister unexpectedly called for the session to be held in secret on the grounds that he would be sharing confidential information with the parliament, the opposition withdrew its no-confidence motion in protest.It has said it will call a new no-confidence vote in the near future, and is now demanding another parliamentary session next week.Speaking to the media after Tuesday's session, members of the opposition said Fico read a report from the intelligence agency SIS (Slovak Information Service), raising concerns about an uprising similar to the Maidan Revolution in Ukraine in 2014 that resulted in the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych .Opposition leader Michal Simecka, head of the Progressive Slovakia party, called the prime minister's speech ""paranoid.""""I'm afraid that the prime minister is suffering from delusions,"" he said. ""He sees things that don't exist. There's no other explanation I can think of. So, this is my takeaway from his speech.""Fico's critics have said there was no genuinely secret information in the report, and some claim the SIS is being instrumentalized for political purposes.""The SIS is being abused. It serves a political purpose of this government, it spreads hatred and fear of the critics of the government,"" said lawmaker Maria Kolikova of the center-right liberal Freedom and Solidarity party.Another protest is already planned for February 6. ""The protest will continue as long as the people want to protest,"" said Stasselova of Peace for Ukraine. ""It will depend on the actions of Fico's cabinet, their statements, their politics.""","Prime Minister Robert Fico claimed there were plans to escalate anti-government protests into an attempted coup.

WASHINGTON: The White House said Sunday that a deal between Lebanon and Israel had been extended until February 18, as Israel missed a previous deadline to pull troops.""The arrangement between Lebanon and Israel, monitored by the United States, will continue to be in effect until February 18, 2025,"" the White House said in a brief statement.Donald Trump's White House also said that the United States would negotiate with Israel and Lebanon for the return of Lebanese prisoners captured since the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, which brought parallel fighting, at first on a small scale, between Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah.The statement did not explicitly mention a ceasefire, which has been increasingly in doubt as Israeli forces killed 22 people on Sunday, according to Lebanon's health ministry.The White House also did not make any reference to France, which worked alongside the United States under former president Joe Biden to reach the ceasefire on November 27.The deal ended Israel's military campaign in Lebanon against Iranian-backed Hezbollah. Under the 60-day deal, the Lebanese army was to deploy alongside UN peacekeepers in the south as the Israeli army withdrew.Israel made clear in recent days it had no intention to meet the deadline, saying Lebanon's fledgling army had not fulfilled its side of the deal.On Sunday, Israeli forces opened fire and killed 22 people, including six women, as they returned to their villages, according to Lebanon's health ministry.The Israeli military said it targeted suspects who posed an ""imminent threat"" to its troops.","The White House said Sunday that a deal between Lebanon and Israel had been extended until February 18, as Israel missed a previous deadline to pull troops.

US Vice President JD Vance engaged in a heated exchange with CBS anchor Margaret Brennan on Sunday during an interview on 'Face the Nation', sparring over immigration policies, refugee vetting, and President Donald Trump ‚Äôs executive orders.The conversation focused on Trump‚Äôs recent decision to pause refugee resettlement programs and enforce stricter vetting for visa applicants. Brennan pressed Vance on his previous remarks advocating for properly vetted refugees, questioning whether his stance had shifted given the suspension of resettlement operations.Vance expressed scepticism about the vetting of refugees entering the United States, citing security concerns.""I don't agree that all these immigrants or all these refugees have been properly vetted,"" Vance said. ""We know there are cases of people allegedly vetted who were later planning terrorist attacks in our country.

Despite undergoing multiple vetting processes, the individual had been flagged as a threat.""I don't want my children to share a neighbourhood with people who are not properly vetted,"" Vance said. ""And because I don't want it for my kids, I'm not going to force other American citizens' kids to do that either.""The conversation shifted to Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of illegal immigrants, a controversial move that has reignited debates over the country's immigration policies. Brennan argued that the United States is ""a country founded by immigrants.""Vance pushed back, calling current immigration policies outdated and ineffective.""Just because we were founded by immigrants doesn't mean that, 240 years later, we have to have the dumbest immigration policy in the world,"" Vance said.

Commentator and author Meghan McCain, daughter of late senator John McCain, said her highly placed source confirmed that former president Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama are heading for a divorce.Speaking on her podcast to Puck reporter Tara Palmeri, McCain confirmed the rumors that is going around the internet and said her sources are reputable people and not like website TMZ.""I have been hearing this rumor that the Obamas are getting a divorce by reputable people. I'm not talking about TMZ. I'm not talking about Perez Hilton...

""We've heard that for a long time, like I just heard that they live separate lives.""Then the duo talked about the photo that Barack posted to wish on Michelle Obama's birthday and said that the photo was quite bad. 'I would kill Ben if he put a picture of me looking like no makeup with that lighting on social media,' McCain said, referring to her husband, Ben Domenech. 'I would kill him. So for me it didn't help the rumors, and like why are you putting this like s****y picture of your wife up?'Palmeri said Michelle Obama always hated politics and did not like being the first lady. As they are no longer in politics, this is a chance to drop Washington completely, she said. ""I am not at home with them, but it's not really surprising at this phase of their life and she clearly has very little interest - she's always hated politics! She did not really like being First Lady,"" she said.Michelle and Obama were last seen together in early mid-December when they stepped out for dinner in Los Angeles. The divorce rumors became intense amid speculations that Barack Obama has been dating Jennifer Aniston, though the actor dismissed the rumors last October on Jimmy Kimmel show.Barack and Michelle first met in 1989 when they both worked at a law firm in Chicago. They got married in 1992 and had their first daughter Malia in 2998, and second daughter Sasha in 2001.Barack Obama appeared solo at Jimmy Carter's funeral and Donald Trump's inauguration. The decision to skip both events was seen as a political message but questions were raised as to why she was vacationing without Barack Obama if there is no trouble in their marriage.","Meghan McCain said she heard from reliable sources that Barack Obama and Michelle Obama are heading for a divorce.

The United States has frozen all the foreign aids for several countries, including Ukraine on Friday but Israel and Turkey are exempted.An internal directive from secretary of state Marco Rubio, issued shortly after President Donald Trump 's inauguration, emphasised an ""America First"" approach to overseas assistance, AFP reported.""No new funds shall be obligated for new awards or extensions of existing awards until each proposed new award or extension has been reviewed and approved,"" stated the internal memo obtained by AFP.According to the memo, the exceptions were only meant for emergency food, and military funding for Israel and Egypt.This comprehensive directive impacts various aid categories, including development and military support, notably affecting Ukraine, which had received substantial weapons funding under the previous Biden administration during its defence against Russian forces.The suspension also halts US funding for PEPFAR, the HIV/AIDS programme providing anti-retroviral treatments in developing nations, particularly across Africa.PEPFAR, established during George W Bush's presidency in 2003, has preserved approximately 26 million lives and previously maintained broad bipartisan backing in Washington.The directive specifically excludes military aid to Israel, whose US arms support has increased since the Gaza conflict, and Egypt, a recipient of substantial US defence funding since its 1979 peace agreement with Israel.Rubio included provisions for US emergency food aid contributions, which have supported crisis-affected regions including Sudan and Syria.Democratic legislators highlighted that PEPFAR supports over 20 million individuals requiring medication, whilst US-funded anti-malaria initiatives assist 63 million people.","The United States has frozen all the foreign aids for several countries, including Ukraine on Friday.

Man claims he started viral goofy prank in US state,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/googly-eye-bandit-outs-self-man-claims-he-started-viral-goofy-prank-in-us-state/articleshow/117587960.cms,"Last month, googly eyes appeared on pieces of public art throughout Bend, Oregon. Drivers would rubberneck, befuddled and amused by statues of deer and other sculptures that had been given an irreverent, cross-eyed gaze. The eyes became a sensation, except among frustrated city officials, who paid for their removal.The identity of the person behind the pranks, who became known as the Googly Eye Bandit , was unknown. That is until Jeff Keith came forward to claim responsibility. Keith, 53, who runs the Guardian Group, a nonprofit focused on disrupting sex trafficking in the US, said that in mid-Dec he sneaked into the middle of a roundabout and put the googly eyes on some public art. ""Big Ears"" by Joe Halko, a sculpture depicting a family of deer, became googly-eyed - including the little fawn between its mother's legs. ""If Bambi's mom had had those eyes, maybe she'd have seen that hunter coming,"" Stephen Colbert joked on ""The Late Show.""""I love making people smile,"" Keith said in an interview on Saturday. ""Other people started joining in. I'm not taking credit for all of them. That's the cool part."" Placing the eyes around the city was a ""release"" from the nature of his work, he said, adding that he did not know who else joined the effort.Even more googly eyes appeared on statues around Bend. Among other art installations, a six-foot sphere was brought to life and given a touch of whimsy and a red phoenix took on an air of bewilderment. While the pranks got widespread attention, it was left to the city to remove the eyes.""While the googly eyes might give you a chuckle,"" the city said on Instagram in Dec, ""it costs money to remove them."" The city paid $1,500 to have the eyes removed while carefully preventing damage to the art,its spokeswoman said.Some online commenters were frustrated with the city, saying that officials couldn't take a joke and suggesting better uses for the city's budget. Keith, who has lived in Bend for over two decades, said he went to the city offices and offered to pay for the cleanup that but he had not heard back. Bend's city office is yet to comment about Keith's offer and if it had identified him as the prankster.","Last month, googly eyes appeared on pieces of public art throughout Bend, Oregon.

That lifts a pressure point meant to reduce civilian casualties during Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza, which is now halted by a tenuous ceasefire.""We released them today,"" Trump said of the bombs. ""They've been waiting for them for a long time."" Asked why he lifted the ban on those bombs, Trump responded, ""Because they bought them.""Resuming delivery of large bombs is a break with then-President Biden, who halted their delivery in May as part of an effort to keep Israel from launching an all-out assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah. A month later, Israel did take control of the city, but after the vast majority of the 1 million civilians that had been living or sheltering in Rafah had fled.Trump has built his political career around being unapologetically pro-Israel. On his larger vision for Gaza, Trump said he had call earlier in the day with King Abdullah II of Jordan and would speak Sunday with President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi of Egypt.""I'd like Egypt to take people,"" Trump said. ""You're talking about probably a million and a half people, and we just clean out that whole thing and say, 'You know, it's over.'""Trump said he complimented Jordan for having successfully accepted Palestinian refugees and that he told the king, ""I'd love for you to take on more, cause I'm looking at the whole Gaza Strip right now, and it's a mess. It's a real mess.""Such a drastic displacement of people would openly contradict Palestinian identity and deep connection to Gaza. Still, Trump said the part of the world that encompasses Gaza, has ""had many, many conflicts"" over centuries. He said resettling ""could be temporary or long term."" ""Something has to happen,"" Trump said.""But it's literally a demolition site right now. Almost everything's demolished, and people are dying there."" He added: ""So, I'd rather get involved with some of the Arab nations, and build housing in a different location, where they can maybe live in peace for a change.""Israeli finance minister Bezalel Smotrich, who has repeatedly called for the return of Jewish settlers to Gaza, welcomed Trump's call as ""an excellent idea"" and said he would work to develop a plan to implement it. Israeli PM Netanyahu, in a statement Sunday, thanked Trump for ""keeping your promise to give Israel the tools it needs to defend itself.""

Greenland and Canada: Bold plans for expansion

Aboard Air Force One, US President Donald Trump held a candid 20-minute Q&A with reporters during a flight from Las Vegas to Florida. Touching on topics as varied as TikTok‚Äôs future, potential changes to Air Force One's colour scheme, and his bold vision for Greenland and Canada, Trump once again made headlines with his off-the-cuff remarks.Trump reiterated his desire to revamp Air Force One's iconic design, calling the current baby blue ""outdated.""""We want power blue, not baby blue,"" he said. ""Everything has its time and place, and we'll be changing the colours.""Trump addressed the ongoing controversy surrounding TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media app facing a potential US ban. While reports linked Oracle‚Äôs Larry Ellison to the app's acquisition, Trump denied direct discussions with Ellison, whom he described as a friend. However, he confirmed he had talked with other ""very substantial people"" interested in purchasing TikTok.""We have a lot of interest in it, and the United States will be a big beneficiary,"" Trump said. ""I'd only do it if the United States benefits.""He credited TikTok with helping him connect with younger voters and expects a decision on its future within 30 days.Trump criticised remote work practices, saying that federal employees must return to their offices or face consequences.""You have to go to your office and you have to work.

""I do believe Greenland, we'll get because it really has to do with freedom of the world,"" he said.On Canada, Trump suggested that the neighbouring country should become a US state.""Canada's been taking advantage of the United States for years,"" he said, citing trade deficits and close economic ties. ""If it's a state, the people of Canada will pay a much lower tax, have no military problems, and be much more secure.""He described Canada as ""a country that should be a state,"" claiming the move would benefit Canadians with improved security, better treatment, and lower taxes.","US President Donald Trump held a candid 20-minute Q&A with reporters during a flight from Las Vegas to Florida.

Six of the petitioners appeared in court on Friday after the case was set for hearing.They claimed that it was the responsibility of the respondents to protect and provide a safe environment for all foreign citizens legally staying and investing in the country, including the petitioners.The petitioners said the Sindh police had engaged in repeated acts of harassment over the last six to seven months, including unwarrantedly restricting movement of Chinese nationals in Karachi and Sindh and unjustified detentions within their residences on the pretext of ‚Äúsecurity issues‚Äù without any clear legal grounds or specific incidents to justify such actions.They also claimed that the policemen stationed at their homes literally locked them in and restricted their movement within the confines of their houses, and that when the petitioners bowed to their illegal demands of paying Pakistani Rs 30,000 ($110) to Rs 50,000 ($182), they were let go.The petitioners also stated that officers from Sukhan police station (in Sindh) had recently sealed seven industrial units of other Chinese nationals without prior notice, citing security reasons.They added that their problems began when they arrived at the airport where officials refused to let them enter the country unless they were bribed, despite having all legally required papers.They also accused police of allegedly throwing stones at their vehicles and smashing the rear screens of their cars, and that the deployed policemen appeared indecent and unprofessionally trained. They cited complaints against them for disturbing privacy and demanding tips ranging from Pakistani Rs 15,000 ($55) to Rs 50,000 ($182).The petition also referenced an incident in which three Chinese female investors were forced to return to China after being treated disrespectfully at a Karachi expo centre. They warned that unless the authorities intervened they would either return to Lahore or leave the country altogether.The petitioners requested the HC to direct the authorities to respect the rights of Chinese nationals in conformity with international laws. In response, the court sent notices to all parties concerned, including the home ministry, chief secretary and police chief of Sindh, home secretary, the head of the special unit for CPEC security, and the Chinese embassy.","At least 12 Chinese nationals had filed a petition in the Sindh HC in Dec.

LAHORE: A Pakistani court has awarded a death sentence and 80-year imprisonment to four persons for uploading blasphemous content on Facebook , an official said on Saturday. Additional Sessions Judge Mohammad Tariq Ayub on Friday convicted four suspects -- Wajid Ali, Ahfaq Ali Saqib, Rana Usman and Suleman Sajid -- for insulting Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), his companions, and his wives.The court official said the convicts uploaded blasphemous content on Facebook from four different IDs.""The judge after hearing arguments of both prosecution and defence and witnesses accounts awarded the death penalty and 80 years imprisonment to each of them on different counts,"" the official said.They were also slapped with a fine of PKR 5.2 million.Pakistan's Federal Investigation (FIA) Cybercrime registered a case under Section 11 of the PECA (Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act) and 295A, 295B, 295C, 298A, 109 and 34 of the Pakistan Penal Code on the complaint of Shiraz Farooqi, a citizen.According to Amnesty International , Pakistan's blasphemy laws are often used against religious minorities and others who are the target of false accusations, while emboldening vigilantes prepared to threaten or kill the accused.""There is overwhelming evidence that Pakistan's blasphemy laws violate human rights and encourage people to take the law into their own hands. Once a person is accused, they become ensnared in a system that offers them few protections, presumes them guilty, and fails to safeguard them against people willing to use violence,"" it said.Amnesty International added that in perversion of the justice system, the accused are often presumed to be guilty based on little or no evidence.""Once an accusation of blasphemy is made, the police can arrest the accused, without even checking to see if the charges make sense. Bowing to public pressure from angry crowds, including religious clerics and their supporters, they frequently pass cases on to prosecutors without scrutinising the evidence. And once someone is charged, they can be denied bail and face lengthy and unfair trials,"" it said.",A Pakistani court has awarded a death sentence and 80-year imprisonment to four persons for uploading blasphemous content on Facebook.

The perpetrator voluntarily surrendered to authorities with the weapon, admitting to shooting them upon discovering them together, Geo News reported.Authorities transported the deceased to a nearby hospital for post-mortem examination.In Bungul Dero, Larkana, a separate incident involved the killing of Riaz Brohi and Samina Brohi. The accused murdered the young man and his own wife in Nazar Muhalla before escaping.

Such actions not only stifle freedom of expression and assembly but also set a dangerous precedent of suppressing dissent through force and digital censorship.""""I urge these organizations to pressure the authorities to restore internet services without delay and to ensure that the fundamental rights of the Baloch people to assemble peacefully and voice their concerns are respected. The international community must not remain silent in the face of these repressive measures, as their silence could embolden further human rights violations in the Balochistan,"" the post added.Notably, the internet blackout comes days before Baloch Genocide Remembrance Day , scheduled for January 25, when the people of Balochistan will come together to protest the ongoing atrocities.Serious concerns are being raised due to this history of repression, with fears that the government may use violence to suppress peaceful opposition in Dalbandin once again.The internet blackout heightens concerns among Baloch Youth Conference (BYC) organizers about a possible crackdown on the event. The shutdown severely limits the Baloch people's ability to record and share their experiences of human rights violations, as communication routes are cut off.On Thursday, Mahrang Baloch, in her post on X, said that Pakistauthorities have imposed an internet blackout in Dalbandin.

Individuals and organisations posting such content can also be blocked from platforms.Spreading ""disinformation"" is now a criminal offence, punishable by up to three years in prison and a substantial fine of 2 million Pakistani rupees ($7,150).This law has alarmed human rights activists like Farhatullah Babar, who warned that the law ""stifles the freedom of expression"" and grants excessive power to the executive branch.The opposition strongly condemned the legislation. The leader of the opposition, Omar Ayub Khan , said that the bill could ""lay a foundation for the suppression of voices advocating for constitutional rights."" The party of the jailed former leader, Imran Khan , has stopped any further negotiations with the government.

The Federal Union of Journalists president, Afzal Butt, called the law an attempt to ""suppress the media, social media and journalists.""While the government claims the law is necessary to combat the spread of misinformation and hate speech, critics argue it will be used to silence dissent and control public discourse.
