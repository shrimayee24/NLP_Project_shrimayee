Rajnath admits Centre initiated talks in 2016 'but Hurriyat shut their doors',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rajnath-admits-centre-initiated-talks-in-2016-but-hurriyat-shut-their-doors/articleshow/113177606.cms,"NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh revealed on Sunday that in September 2016, four Opposition MPs had attempted to engage with Hurriyat Conference leaders as part of the central government 's efforts to initiate peace talks in Kashmir . However separatist leaders refused to meet with the delegation, Singh said while addressing an election rally in the Ramban assembly constituency in Jammu.Singh, who was serving as the home minister then, recounted his discussions with the then-chief minister of Jammu & Kashmir Mehbooba Mufti, assuring her that the situation in Kashmir would normalize. He also mentioned that a delegation of MPs, led by Singh himself, had visited the state during that period.The delegation included senior leaders such as Sharad Yadav from the JDU and representatives from Left parties. Singh had suggested that these leaders engage with the Hurriyat Conference, as the BJP was not well-received by the separatists. However, when Sharad Yadav and some Left leaders approached the Hurriyat leaders, they were met with closed doors and a refusal to engage in dialogue with the country's senior MPs.""There were senior leaders like Sharad Yadav (of the JDU) and from the Left parties (in the delegation). I told them that we are from the BJP and the Hurriyat people do not like us and they get irritated on seeing us. You talk to them and tell them that we are ready to talk, but there shall be peace in Kashmir. After asking me, Sharad Yadav and some Left leaders visited the Hurriyat Conference leaders, but they shut their doors on them, saying they will not talk with senior MPs of our country,"" the defence minister said.In his speech on Sunday, Singh also mentioned the filing of FIRs against Kashmiri youth who were involved in stone-pelting incidents that occurred after the death of Burhan Wani.Singh said, ""There were cases against young and innocent children and there were repeated demands from the people to withdraw the cases. People were demanding withdrawal of cases against innocent and minor children and I talked to Mehbooba and asked her to release them. We did everything but the way they (Hurriyat leaders) should have responded, they did not,"" Rajnath said.This marks the first time the central government has acknowledged its attempts to reach out to separatists in 2016, a period marked by widespread protests in Kashmir following the killing of militant commander Burhan Wani. The admission comes despite the Narendra Modi government's consistent portrayal in public of its tough stance against separatists.During the all-party delegation's visit to the state in September 2016, amidst violence that claimed 72 lives, four Opposition MPs broke away from the 26-member group and visited the Srinagar residence of hardline Hurriyat leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani, who was under house arrest. Geelani, however, snubbed the MPs and refused to open his doors.Hardline Hurriyat leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani didn’t let the MPs in as then-JDU leader Sharad Yadav and Communist leaders Sitaram Yechury and D Raja kept waiting at the door of his upscale Hyderpora residence for about ten minutes before returning.At the time, Singh had said that the MPs visited on their own, saying, ""I want to clarify that some members of the all-party delegation went to meet Hurriyat leaders. We had neither said no nor yes to their meetings (with separatists). You know what happened. I do not wish to go into the details.""He had further said, ""But whatever information those friends gave us upon their return, it can be said it was not Kashmiriyat (Kashmiri value system). It cannot be called insaniyat (humanity). When someone goes for talks and they reject it, it is not jamhooriyat (democracy) as well.""",Four Opposition MPs had attempted to engage with Hurriyat Conference leaders in September 2016.

Elon backs Trump's plan to 'fire every federal bureaucrat' engaged in censorship: What he said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-backs-trumps-plan-to-fire-every-federal-bureaucrat-engaged-in-censorship-what-he-said/articleshow/113171842.cms,"Former President Donald Trump ’s pledge to combat domestic censorship received a notable endorsement from tech billionaire Elon Musk. In response to a video of Trump’s recent rally, Musk praised the plan on X (formerly Twitter), simply commenting “Great.""Speaking at a rally in Mosinee, Wisconsin, Trump criticised the press , calling them “horrible” and “dishonest.”“Second, I will bring back free speech in America because it's been taken away,” Trump declared.“They've taken away your free speech. And the fake news is a threat to this country. They are just horrible. These are horrible people.”Elon, who once identified as a Democrat and voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Joe Biden in 2020, has recently become one of Donald Trump's most prominent supporters. Musk’s newfound alignment with Trump has led to Trump proposing that, if elected, he would appoint Musk to lead a new government efficiency commission.Trump accused the media of distorting the truth and claimed that the press is biased against him and other conservatives. “When we know the facts and then the story gets written the exact opposite of what it is, you start to lose faith in the press,” he said. He also announced plans to sign an executive order banning federal employees from colluding to limit speech and to fire any bureaucrats involved in domestic censorship.""I will sign an executive order banning any federal employee from colluding to limit speech. And we will fire every federal bureaucrat who is engaged in domestic censorship under the Harris regime,"" Trump said.The former president’s comments come as he prepares for his first and likely only debate against Vice President Kamala Harris. Ahead of the debate, Trump took to social media to threaten legal action against those he claims are involved in election fraud, despite the lack of evidence supporting such allegations.“WHEN I WIN, those people that CHEATED will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law,” Trump warned on Saturday. He extended this threat to lawyers, political operatives, donors, illegal voters, and corrupt election officials, saying that “unscrupulous behavior will be sought out, caught, and prosecuted at levels, unfortunately, never seen before in our Country.”In his rally speech, Trump also reiterated his intention to dismantle the current administration's approach to justice. He pledged to “completely overhaul” what he labeled “Kamala’s corrupt Department of Injustice” and focus on combating violent crime and terrorism.Harris's campaign responded to Trump’s remarks by expressing concerns that he would use his power to target political adversaries and pardon those involved in the January 6th Capitol attack if re-elected. “If Trump is reelected, he will use his unchecked power to prosecute his enemies and pardon insurrectionists,” warned Harris spokesperson Sarafina Chitika","Elon Musk has become one of Donald Trump's most prominent supporters.

With polls showing a tight race, both candidates know that Pennsylvania could determine the outcome of the 2024 presidential election.No Democrat has won the White House without Pennsylvania since 1948, making the stakes even higher for Harris.Trump, meanwhile, is looking to repeat his 2016 success in the state, where he narrowly defeated Hillary Clinton before losing to Joe Biden in 2020.“People say, ‘If you win Pennsylvania, you’re going to win the whole thing,’” Trump told supporters in Wilkes-Barre last month. The former president has made frequent visits to Pennsylvania, where he narrowly escaped an assassination attempt during a speech in Butler County in July. Harris, too, has been a frequent visitor, with plans to return on Friday to continue rallying her base.The debate is set to take place at the National Constitution Center, located in Philadelphia, a Democratic stronghold. Harris aims to reassemble the coalition of voters that helped Biden win in 2020, focusing on mobilizing key groups such as college students, Black voters, and women motivated by the protection of abortion rights. Winning big in Philadelphia and its suburbs will be crucial for Harris as she tries to offset Trump’s dominance in the state’s rural areas.Republicans are banking on voters’ concerns about the economy and inflation, hoping to chip away at Democrats' stronghold in Pennsylvania’s suburban areas. “A lot of people are saying, ‘We need the American economy to become strong again,’” said Lawrence Tabas, chair of Pennsylvania’s Republican Party.While Harris is focused on economic issues like capping prescription drug prices and lowering childcare costs, the debate may prove pivotal in winning over undecided voters. Political experts suggest that many Pennsylvanians are still learning about Harris as a candidate, with her late entry into the race leaving room for voters to make up their minds before Election Day.The path to the presidency runs through Pennsylvania, and with both candidates eyeing the state's electoral votes, the outcome of this debate could play a decisive role in shaping the 2024 race.","Pennsylvania could determine the outcome of the 2024 presidential election.

Trump threatens 100% tariff to defend dollar’s global dominance: Implications for India and beyond,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-threatens-100-tariff-to-defend-dollars-global-dominance-implications-for-india-and-beyond/articleshow/113177036.cms,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump announced a bold new strategy to safeguard the US dollar ’s global dominance during his rally in Wisconsin on Saturday. Trump vowed to impose a 100% tariff on goods from countries that shift away from using the dollar in international trade.“You leave the dollar and you’re not doing business with the United States because we are going to put a 100 percent tariff on your goods,” Trump declared, underscoring his protectionist stance .This threat is part of a broader tariff platform aimed at countering efforts by countries like China, India, and others to de-dollarize their trade.The announcement follows extensive discussions between Trump and his economic advisers about how to penalize nations engaging in trade with currencies other than the dollar. Possible measures have included export controls, currency manipulation charges, and tariffs, as reported by Bloomberg News.Trump, who has consistently championed protectionist policies, asserted that the dollar has been “under major siege” for the past eight years. This stance comes in the wake of a recent summit where China, India, Brazil, Russia, and South Africa explored de-dollarization strategies. Trump, however, reaffirmed his commitment to maintaining the dollar as the world’s reserve currency.Despite a gradual decrease in dollar dominance, the US currency still represented 59% of official foreign-exchange reserves in early 2024, according to the International Monetary Fund. The euro follows with nearly 20%.In the fiercely contested race for the White House, Wisconsin is a key battleground state where Trump and Democratic rival Kamala Harris are vying for the support of working-class voters disillusioned with President Joe Biden’s economic policies. A recent Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll shows Harris leading Trump by 8 percentage points in Wisconsin, the largest margin in the seven battleground states surveyed.Trump’s rally in Wisconsin capped off a campaign swing that included stops in Pennsylvania and North Carolina, as well as a significant address in New York City focusing on economic issues. Meanwhile, Harris spent Saturday in Pennsylvania preparing for her upcoming debate with Trump, a critical event that could influence the tight race.As Trump’s campaign continues to emphasize economic nationalism and defense of the dollar, the global implications for countries like India, which has been part of de-dollarization discussions, remain significant. The unfolding dynamics between the US and its international trade partners will likely be a key focus in the months leading up to the election.","Donald Trump vowed to impose a 100% tariff on goods from countries that shift away from using the dollar in international trade.

The path to tragedy

A tragic outcome

Marcee Gray , a former engineer from Fitzgerald, Georgia , has been thrust into the spotlight following the tragic shooting at Apalachee High School in Winder, Georgia. Her son, Colt Gray , 14, has been charged with the murder of four people in the incident.Marcee Gray’s professional life seemed to be on an upward trajectory.She reportedly earned a Bachelor’s degree in Industrial Management from Georgia Southern University in 2005 and a Master’s degree in Occupational Safety and Health from Columbia Southern University in 2008. Her career included notable positions such as Quality Engineering Supervisor at Toyota Industries, North America, and Quality Manager at Olympic Steel.However, her career was cut short in 2021, with her LinkedIn profile showing her final roles as Quality Assurance Manager at Georgia Pacific LLC and Senior Quality Engineer at PCC Airfoils, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.Marcee's personal life, however, tells a starkly different story. Arrested in 2023 on charges related to drug possession, trafficking, and vehicle theft, her criminal record reveals a history of drug abuse and domestic violence, reported the New York Post. According to her sister, Annie Polhamus Brown, Marcee's addiction and subsequent actions have deeply affected their family. “Marcee destroyed our family with her drug addiction,” Polhamus Brown said in social media posts.Marcee’s tumultuous relationship with her husband, Colin Gray, was marked by allegations of abuse. Marcee herself detailed the abusive nature of her marriage in social media posts, explaining why she stayed for 14 years: “I made a commitment to the Lord and my husband. No one but me understands the pain that my husband lives with every single day,” she wrote.Neighbors and family members paint a grim picture of Colt’s upbringing, reported the New York Post. Lauren Vickers, a neighbor, described frequent disturbances and neglect: “There were nights where the mom would lock him and his sister out the house… It was constant abuse.” Charles Polhamus, Colt’s maternal grandfather, described Colt as “a good kid” in a “hostile” environment, suffering from the abuse he and his mother endured.Investigations are now focusing on the family's interactions with child protective services. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is looking into Colt’s mental health struggles and his family’s failure to address them adequately.The situation worsened when Colin Gray, who works in construction, reportedly bought Colt an AR-15 rifle for Christmas. Colin has been charged with multiple counts, including involuntary manslaughter and cruelty to children. The GBI’s Chris Hosey emphasized that these charges stem from Colin’s decision to allow Colt to possess the weapon.Annie Brown expressed frustration at the adults who failed to help Colt, saying, “The adults around him failed him.”Colt Gray has been charged as an adult with four counts of murder following the Apalachee High School shooting. The tragic case highlights a profound failure within a family that once seemed capable of so much more.","Marcee Gray, a former engineer from Fitzgerald, Georgia, has been thrust into the spotlight following the tragic shooting at Apalachee High School in Winder, Georgia.

Evacuation and firefighting efforts intensify

Heatwave and air quality worsen conditions

An out-of-control wildfire in the foothills of San Bernardino National Forest , east of Los Angeles, is threatening tens of thousands of homes and structures. As of Sunday, over 35,000 buildings, including single-family homes, commercial properties, and apartment complexes, are at risk. The fire, known as the Line Fire, has been burning since Thursday evening, and local authorities have issued evacuation orders across several areas.Three firefighters have been injured as they fight the blaze, which has already scorched about 27 square miles of land. More than 600 firefighters are working to contain the fire, supported by helicopters dropping water over threatened areas. Thunderstorms expected later in the day could complicate efforts, with authorities warning that conditions remain extremely dangerous.With the wildfire spreading rapidly, San Bernardino County declared a local emergency on Saturday evening. Governor Gavin Newsom followed up by proclaiming a state of emergency for the region and securing federal support from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to aid firefighting efforts.The extreme heatwave affecting Southern California , with temperatures exceeding 100°F, has fueled the fire’s intensity. Low humidity and dry vegetation have created ideal conditions for the flames to spread, according to state officials. The National Weather Service has issued warnings about air quality due to smoke and excessive heat, with temperatures soaring across the region.Evacuation orders have been issued for communities including Running Springs, Arrowbear Lake, and several other regions east of Highway 330. Thousands of residents have been displaced as firefighters work to protect homes from the encroaching fire.The fire, which began Thursday evening, remains 0% contained, and its cause is still under investigation. The National Weather Service warned that thunderstorms could spark new fires and worsen conditions for the firefighters on the ground.Despite the intense firefighting efforts, no homes have been reported damaged yet. Helicopters and other aircraft have been deployed to aid ground crews as they attempt to slow the fire’s spread.In addition to the fire, Southern California is enduring sweltering temperatures, with downtown Los Angeles reaching 112°F on Friday, one of the highest temperatures recorded in the city since 1877. Excessive heat warnings remain in place across the region, further complicating the firefighting efforts. Residents are advised to stay indoors due to both the heat and poor air quality resulting from wildfire smoke.The Line Fire is one of several active wildfires in California. Other fires, like the Roblar Fire in San Diego County and the Davis Fire near Reno, Nevada, have also caused significant damage and forced evacuations. In Nevada, the Davis Fire has destroyed 12 structures and burned more than 1,500 acres.","The Line Fire has scorched 27 square miles of land in the San Bernardino National Forest, east of Los Angeles.

Kalalau Trail , a 22-mile round-trip stretch within Napali Coast State Wilderness Park , was recommended to remain closed until at least Sept 19 while health department officials assessed the risk of transmission and as stations along the trail were disinfected.Health department received reports of illness from at least 37 hikers and campers over the past several weeks, though the actual number is expected to be higher, officials said.""This is a very concerning and rare occurrence, magnified by the extreme remote nature of Kalalau Valley,"" Curt Cottrell, an administrator for state parks, said.The trail was closed Wednesday after health officials received several reports of gastrointestinal illnesses from hikers, and Thursday health department said test results from four patients confirmed they had contracted norovirus.The state's department of land and natural resources said dozens of backpackers had reported gastrointestinal illness , and one person was evacuated but no one had been hospitalised. ""All it takes is one person to spread the virus, which can be on surfaces, in soil and in water,"" said department spokesman Dan Dennison.Norovirus is highly contagious and typically causes vomiting, often accompanied by fever, abdominal cramps and diarrhoea as the stomach or intestines become inflamed. It spreads easily, and is common in tightly packed spaces, but it can also be transmitted across contaminated surfaces. Most people recover after several days, but severe infections can occur in young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems.Kalalau Trail allows up to 80 people with permits to camp overnight, and composting toilets are available. One way that norovirus can spread is through contact with fecal matter.The open air might help dilute the virus ""but mostly it's just being around people that are ill and shedding the virus"" that aids in spreading it, said Donald Schaffner of Rutgers University. The spread in a ventilated environment such as a trail ""is possible due to virus transmissibility and challenges to hand hygiene and sanitation,"" department of land and natural resources said.""Hiking is one of the activities that is a risk"" for the virus, said Stuart C Ray, professor at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. ""The problem is people don't have good access to clean water, and they can't wash their hands."" Alcohol wipes do not kill the virus, he added.",Kalalau Trail is a 22-mile round-trip stretch within Napali Coast State Wilderness Park.

"‘Just let him die’ – Donald Trump allegedly insulted disabled family member, claims relative",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/just-let-him-die-donald-trump-allegedly-insulted-disabled-family-member-claims-relative/articleshow/113173451.cms,"Fred Trump , the nephew of former President Donald Trump , has sparked controversy with the release of his new book, All in the Family: The Trumps and How We Got This Way. In the book, Fred accuses his uncle of making cruel remarks about disabled Americans, including Fred's own son, William , who suffers from severe developmental disabilities. Fred claims that during Donald Trump’s time in office, he suggested that people with disabilities, like William, “should just die” because of the high cost of care.He made these claims while speaking to The Independent’s Sheila Flynn, recalling a meeting at the White House where Trump allegedly said, “Those people … the shape they’re in, all the expenses, maybe those kinds of people should just die.” Fred was stunned by the comment, especially since William is Donald Trump’s great-nephew.William, born in 1999, requires 24/7 care due to a range of physical and developmental issues. Fred and his wife, Lisa, have been dedicated advocates for disability rights ever since. The family has faced challenges not only due to William’s condition but also because of tensions with the larger Trump family. Fred recounts a phone call in 2020 where he asked Donald Trump for help with William’s mounting medical costs. Trump reportedly responded, “He doesn’t recognize you. Maybe you should just let him die and move down to Florida.” Fred expressed his horror, adding, “How could one human being say that about another human being, least of all his grand-nephew?”The book not only highlights Fred’s personal battle for disability rights but also sheds light on the complicated and, at times, toxic relationships within the Trump family. Fred and his sister Mary were disinherited from their grandfather Frederick Trump’s estate after a legal battle that ended in 2001. He believes his uncle Donald played a key role in pressuring their grandfather, who was suffering from dementia at the time, to cut them out of the will. “It was nowhere near what my grandfather intended,” Fred wrote in his book.Despite these personal grievances, Fred insists that his primary goal is to shine a light on the challenges people with disabilities face and to advocate for better care, resources, and training for caregivers. He believes his famous family name can help amplify this message. “I have a national platform,” Fred told The Independent. “There’s nobody out there just shouting from the rooftops, if you will, saying this needs to be done.”Fred also criticised Donald Trump's capacity to evade responsibility, alleging that his uncle regularly sidesteps criticism and downplays his divisive comments. “Oh, I didn’t mean it that way, I wasn’t making fun of that reporter, what are you talking about?” Fred told the Independent, citing instances in the past where Donald Trump said hurtful things about people with disabilities.While the release of his book has further strained relations with the Trump family, Fred says he is at peace with the fallout. He remains committed to his advocacy work and believes that the exposure of these family dynamics will help the cause of disability rights. “I’ll reach out to him again,” Fred said of Donald Trump. “I have no fear.”","Fred Trump, the nephew of former President Donald Trump, has released his new book, All in the Family: The Trumps and How We Got This Way.

New York, Sep 08, 2024 (AFP) -From Gerald Ford's catastrophic Soviet gaffe to Ronald Reagan's witty remark about his age and Joe Biden's infamous implosion, US presidential debates have featured jaw-dropping moments.Here are some of the most memorable in modern US politics.It was the first televised debate of its kind, when broadcasts were in black-and-white, and it established the importance of a politician's public image.Republican Richard Nixon looked poised to win the election, having served two terms as vice president under Dwight Eisenhower.But the debate did not go well for him. Nixon refused to wear makeup and appeared pale and sweaty in front of more than 66 million viewers, while young Massachusetts senator John F. Kennedy looked tanned and relaxed. While Nixon addressed the moderator, Kennedy looked at the camera, speaking directly to his voters.How much the debate visuals pushed the needle is disputed, but Kennedy went on to defeat Nixon at the polls.The first debate between Republican president Gerald Ford and Democratic challenger Jimmy Carter was marked by a 27-minute loss of audio. The second debate didn't go well for Ford either, when he made a gaffe that arguably cost him the presidency.At the height of the Cold War, Ford uttered that ""there is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, and there never will be under a Ford administration,"" even though the Soviet Union had troops deployed across the Eastern bloc.Six days passed before Ford explained himself, saying he spoke not of the literal military presence but meant that people's spirits there hadn't been crushed.Republican president Ronald Reagan was 73 when he ran for a second term against 56-year-old Walter Mondale. But he turned his age into his strength with a witty answer that went down in history.""I will not make age an issue of this campaign,"" Reagan said when asked whether he was fit for office. ""I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.""The second presidential debate in the 1992 race pitted incumbent president George Bush against both his future successor Bill Clinton and Ross Perot, an independent candidate.Bush was caught on camera looking at his watch while Clinton talked to an audience member during a town hall debate, a move that cost Bush dearly.Years later, Bush admitted he hated debates. ""Maybe that's why I was looking at it -- 'Only 10 more minutes of this crap.'""During a debate against president Barack Obama, Republican challenger Mitt Romney lamented that the US Navy had fewer ships presently than it did in 1916.""Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed,"" Obama retorted.""We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them. We have these ships that go under water, nuclear submarines.""Obama's comments went viral.The second debate of the 2016 US presidential election pitting Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump was particularly vicious.Coming shortly after the release of a video in which Trump was heard boasting that his fame allowed him to grope women, the Republican billionaire went after his opponent's husband, former president Bill Clinton, accusing him of being ""so abusive to women.""Trump also vowed to have Hillary Clinton investigated over her use of a private email account when she was secretary of state.""It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country,"" Clinton said.Trump shot back: ""Because you'd be in jail.""The first debate of the 2020 presidential election, featuring Trump and Democrat Joe Biden, devolved into shouting and insults.With Trump constantly interrupting him, Biden snapped, saying, ""Will you shut up, man?""The Democrat also called his opponent a ""clown"" and ""Putin's puppy.""Trump for his part kept evading the question of whether he would recognize the results of the election.Powerless to control the two candidates, the debate moderator, Fox News journalist Chris Wallace, later described feeling ""desperation.""",Gerald Ford's catastrophic Soviet gaffe arguably cost him the presidency.

Imran Khan's party stage rally in Islamabad; demand his immediate release,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imran-khans-party-stage-rally-in-islamabad-demand-his-immediate-release/articleshow/113173655.cms,"Jailed former premier Imran Khan 's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf on Sunday held a power show, demanding his immediate release while slamming the government for its crackdown on the party as police fired tear gas to disperse the crowd. The rally - postponed twice in the last two months - was held near Sangjani Cattle Market in the suburbs of Islamabad after the capital administration issued a no-objection certificate (NOC).Thousands of PTI supporters attended the rally, proving that the party's power base was intact despite several hurdles it faced, including the incarceration of its 71-year-old founder.Khan was arrested on August 5 last year after his conviction in the Toshakhana corruption case filed by the Election Commission of Pakistan. Since then, he has been in jail in different cases. On Sunday, Khan completed 400 days in prison.The rally was scheduled to end at 7 pm (local time) as per the NOC. As soon as the deadline ended, the district administration directed the police to take action against the rally-goers for not complying with the NOC.The authorities stated that the organisers violated the rules and regulations by not concluding the gathering before the deadline.In response to the crackdown, PTI workers began pelting stones at police, injuring many security personnel, including Senior Superintendent of Police Shoaib Khan .""Strong turnout for PTI rally despite the state's tactics to limit numbers through roadblocks and containers, and despite the risk of violent crackdowns and arrests. Its size and popularity ensure its mobilization capabilities remain intact despite relentless attempts to curb it,"" Micheal Kugleman, a South Asian expert, said in a post on X.Several PTI leaders addressed the gathering, demanding Khan's immediate release. PTI leader in the National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan said the party would not sit until Khan was released.""We are soldiers of Imran Khan and will not sit until he is set free,"" he said, adding that soon Khan would be with his supporters.He condemned physical hurdles put on roads to restrict the movement of participants and also announced that the PTI would now hold rallies across the country.It was the first major rally by the PTI in Islamabad since the February 8 elections. The party wants to exert pressure on the government to release Khan, who languishes in jail despite the courts either acquitting him or giving him bail in all cases he was convicted.PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan said the government turned the city into a cage, but still thousands of people attended the rally. ""It shows that Imran Khan is a reality, and you will have to accept it...Imran Khan is a leader and will always be a leader,"" he said.He told the participants that Khan was their only leader who never surrendered and would never surrender. He warned that the PTI would not accept new cases against Khan.Gohar said that the PTI planned this rally for six months and followed Khan's instructions to hold the rally after getting permission from the government. He criticised the government for introducing a new law to restrict political activities.Slogans were raised during the rally demanding Khan's release from jail.He ended his speech with the promise that ""Imran Khan will be soon out of jail and with his people"".The key speech was made by Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur who came from Peshawar, leading a large number of Khan's supporters from the province.In his emotional address, he vowed to continue the struggle for the rights of people. He said those who put Khan in jail were being humiliated while ""Khan is winning in jail"".He said that the government gave permission for the rally and blocked all roads leading to the venue of the rally. ""Imran Khan you have won while all others lost,"" he said, vowing to go to any length for Khan.He also announced to hold the next rally in Lahore, irrespective of whether the government gives permission or not.Gandapur also rejected that Khan would be tried under army law, saying no one could do it.Khan has repeatedly shown a willingness to hold talks with the establishment while refusing to sit with the government. So far, all his tactics have failed to get any relief. Mass protest is an option, but his party has been facing pressure to avoid it.Today's rally was a test for both the government and the PTI as it will help them gauge the ground power swell for Khan and fine-tune their policies and tactics in the coming days.Sources told PTI that the Islamabad administration put security on high alert this morning and blocked off multiple arteries leading to the capital city. Hospitals were put on alert by the administration. The Metro bus services were stopped in the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi.Addressing the rally, former minister Hammad Azhar said the hindrance created by the rulers showed that they were afraid of Khan and his supporters.He pointed out that most of the party's Punjab leadership is in jail, paying tribute to incarcerated leaders, including Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Umar Sarfraz Cheema .Another leader Sher Afzal Marwat said they will soon hold rallies in Punjab for Khan's release and the supremacy of law and the Constitution.""We will enter Punjab with 50,000 people from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa within a week,"" he said, adding that they will even set off on foot and face the tear gas.Additional forces have been summoned to the location where the clash between the police and party workers originally started.Meanwhile, President Asif Ali Zardari signed into law the Public Order and Peaceful Assembly Bill 2024 hours before the planned rally, instituting strict measures for unauthorised gatherings.The new law introduces penalties for holding gatherings without permission in Islamabad, with violators facing up to three years in prison and fines. The repeat offenders could be sentenced to up to 10 years in jail.","Thousands of PTI supporters attended the rally, proving that the party's power base was intact.

Shameful, despicable, desperate, cowardly behavior by the illegitimate, authoritarian regime , over & over again. These disgraceful, unlawful acts only strengthen the people's resolve to fight for their 'Haqeeqi Azadi'!""PTI further criticised the actions of law enforcement, calling them ""disgusting and shameful"" and asserting that the crowd had delivered a strong message.""These police officers should be ashamed of themselves, for attacking one of the most peaceful crowds ever. IG Islamabad and tout government should STOP playing with people's lives. This is highly disgusting and shameful, the people sent a huge message today!"" the party added.The rally, which had faced multiple delays due to revoked permissions, finally commenced on the outskirts of Islamabad on Sunday. Despite being denied permission several times earlier, the PTI brought together supporters from across the province, as reported by Dawn.Addressing the rally, senior PTI leader Hammad Azhar said that the gathering was a stand for the rule of law and the supremacy of the Constitution in Pakistan. ""We will, God willing, secure Imran Khan's release,"" Azhar said, adding that no obstacle would deter their cause.The rally had originally been scheduled for July, then postponed to August, before being further delayed due to security concerns cited by authorities. PTI has been pushing for Imran Khan’s release since his imprisonment in August.Although Khan’s conviction in the Iddat case was recently overturned, his release was blocked by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), which arrested him in connection with a new Toshakhana case shortly after. His previous Toshakhana sentences were suspended, and he was also acquitted in the cipher case by the Islamabad high court.PTI has been trying to secure permission for a public meeting in Islamabad for several months, but the district administration has repeatedly denied their requests, citing security risks. The party even approached the Islamabad High Court (IHC) in March for approval.In July, PTI announced another protest , but the district administration revoked their non-objection certificate (NOC) at the last moment, delaying the rally until September 8. Despite preparations for the event, the capital police blocked major entry points to the city, citing intelligence reports of a ""medium-level"" terrorism threat linked to the gathering.Senior PTI leader Asad Qaiser decried the government’s preventive measures, including the placement of containers and police blockades. ""It is unfortunate that this fascist government with a stolen mandate is creating such a hostile environment,"" Qaiser said in a video message posted on X. ""They approved the NOC and the court has permitted the rally, but Rawalpindi has been closed off.""PTI Punjab spokesperson Shaukat Basra also claimed that the police in Punjab had received ""unconstitutional"" orders to block workers from joining the rally.","The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) has accused the police of opening fire on its supporters during a rally in Islamabad on Sunday.

Speaking to a private news channel Geo News, Asif said, ""Evidence against the founder of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) points towards military trial.""Imran Khan has been embroiled in numerous legal cases, including one related to the May 9 riots, where military installations were attacked.Fearing prosecution in a military court, Khan filed a petition in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) seeking to halt the trial. However, the IHC raised concerns about the petition's validity, citing the absence of a specific first information report (FIR) or supporting documentation.Khan's petition comes amid ongoing legal debates. In December 2023, Pakistan's Supreme Court , in a 5:1 majority ruling, suspended an earlier decision that declared civilians' military trials unlawful. This ruling, tied to the May 9 riots, has left the final decision on military trials pending the court's verdict on intra-court appeals filed by the federal and provincial governments and the defence ministry.Asif also commented on former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Lieutenant General (retd) Faiz Hamid, who he claimed aspired to become Pakistan's army chief. Asif alleged that Faiz had reached out to the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) seeking support for his bid, offering loyalty in exchange. Faiz, currently facing allegations of land grabbing, was arrested by the army in August.""General (retd) Faiz wanted to become army chief, his name was on the list. He contacted the PML-N leadership in this regard and assured of his loyalty against support for his bid for army chief,"" said Asif.He further noted that Faiz's frustrations grew after the appointment of the current army chief. Asif suggested that Faiz may now try to deflect blame onto others, adding, ""He [Faiz] might say that even if he was part of the conspiracy then the objectives [of conspiracy] were of the PTI founder's and not his.""Meanwhile, Imran Khan, who is currently detained in Adiala Jail, has warned of protests if the government undermines the judiciary's independence. In a message shared on social media, Khan said, ""Pakistan's army belongs to everyone – to the whole nation – not just one political party or the army chief. They robbed the election and are now not allowing the judiciary to function independently.""Khan also criticised the treatment of Pakistan's current leadership in prison, claiming they enjoyed preferential conditions compared to him. ""I have not spent a single day at the prison hospital,"" he said, contrasting his treatment with that of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and others, who, according to him, had access to air-conditioned rooms with en-suite bathrooms during their time in custody.","Khawaja Asif says evidence against Imran Khan points towards military trial.

On both occasions, the military had publicly denied direct involvement, saying indigenous Kashmiri rebels were fighting Indian forces.In 1999, however, thousands of paramilitary Northern Light Infantry regulars, drawn exclusively from Gilgit-Baltistan and skilled in high-altitude combat, were sent to occupy military posts that Indian troops would vacate in the snowy months.They established positions on the heights and commanded a view of the Srinagar-Leh highway, a major supply route for Indian troops stationed on the Siachen glacier.When India detected the incursion in early May 1999, Pakistan had claimed they were Kashmiri militants fighting Indian rule.According to observers, Pakistan had sent troops to Kargil to cut Indian supplies to Siachen, inflict heavy losses on Indian troops and pressure them into negotiating a settlement of the Kashmir dispute on Pakistani terms. Since Islamabad had conducted nuclear tests a year earlier, Pakistani generals were expecting a muted response from India.But the Indians hit back hard, sending infantry backed by artillery and air support. By mid-June the Pakistani positions on the hills began to fall. There were also international calls for Pakistan to withdraw its forces. Evidence suggested the Pakistani military leadership had not shared details of the Kargil operation with the govt of then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif . On July 4, Sharif was forced to announce a unilateral ceasefire. His govt was toppled in a military coup two months later.India had reconquered the Kargil heights by July 26. It lost more than 500 troops in the war, while estimates of Pakistani losses range from 400 to about 4,000. Thousands of people made homeless by the war are displaced in Pakistan to this day.","Pakistan's military had attempted on at least two occasions to send its forces into Kashmir to start a rebellion against Indian rule.

NEW DELHI: In a first, Pakistan army chief General Asim Munir publicly acknowledged the military's involvement in the Kargil War , during a recent defence day speech. Previous army chiefs and political leaders, such as Pervez Musharraf and Nawaz Sharif, have acknowledged Pakistan's involvement in the Kargil operation.According to several media reports, General Munir -- while addressing a ceremony at the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi to mark the country's 59th Defence Day, said: ""Be it 1948, 1965, 1971 or 1999 Kargil war, thousands of Shuhadas (martyrs) have sacrificed their life for the country and nation.""This marks the first time a serving army chief has openly admitted to the army's direct role in a conflict that has long been shrouded in denial and controversy in Pakistan.The audio of the video, which has been circulated widely online, has not been independently verified.For years, Pakistan's military and political leadership has maintained a narrative that distanced itself from the Kargil operations, often referring to the infiltrators as mere ""Kashmiri freedom fighters"".India has, however, repeatedly said that the operation was a calculated military strategy aimed at altering the Line of Control (LoC) and asserting Pakistan's claim over Kashmir.The Kargil War was characterised by its high-altitude combat and brutal conditions, taking place in one of the most challenging terrains on Earth.The Pakistani military's strategy involved infiltrating troops disguised as militants into Indian territory, occupying strategic heights that overlooked key supply routes.The operation was intended to disrupt Indian logistics and draw international attention to the Kashmir issue, thereby internationalising the longstanding conflict.In strong retaliation to the Pakistan 'infiltrators', between mid-May and July 1999, the Indian Armed Forces gradually recaptured critical positions from the Pakistani infiltrators. The Kargil War officially concluded on July 26, 1999, when the Army announced the complete eviction of Pakistani forces from Indian soil.Over two months, intense battles took place in the challenging mountainous terrain. The Indian Army, as part of Operation Vijay, managed to drive out Pakistani intruders and successfully recaptured Tiger Hill and other strategic positions.","Pakistan army chief publicly acknowledged the military's involvement in the Kargil War.

"Pakistan: In blow to Imran Khan, SC restores changes in anti-corruption law",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-in-blow-to-imran-khan-sc-restores-changes-in-anti-corruption-law/articleshow/113142030.cms,"ISLAMABAD: In a victory for the ruling coalition government and a blow to former Prime Minister Imran Khan , the Pakistan Supreme Court reinstated amendments made to the country's National Accountability Ordinance (NAO), overturning its own decision from last year, Geo News reported.A five-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faiz Isa and comprising Justice Aminuddin, Justice Jamal Khan Mandukhel, Justice Athar Minallah, and Justice Hasan Azhar Rizvi announced the unanimous verdict.Approving the intra-court appeals filed by the federal and provincial governments, Pakistan's apex court remarked that Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan could not prove that NAB (National Accountability Bureau) amendments were unconstitutional.Notably, the top anti-graft body and the PTI founder were made respondents in the intra-party appeals.The majority judgement had struck down some amendments made to the National Accountability Ordinance (NAO), 1999.The amendments -- National Accountability (Second Amendment) Act 2022 -- were passed in a joint sitting of the parliament in April 2022 during the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM)-led government, which came into power after ousting ex-premier Khan via a no-trust move in 2022, as reported by Geo News.It modified sections 2, 4, 5, 6, 25 and 26 of the NAB laws, however, 9 out of 10 amendments were declared ""null and void"" by the CJP Bandial-led bench on the PTI founder's petition filed in June 2022.Referring to the September 15 ruling, the court today pointed out that the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023 -- which required that a plea must be heard by ""not less than five judges of the SC"" -- was enacted while Khan's petition was pending adjudication.The top court also noted that the petition challenging the amendments made to the Ordinance was not heard and decided in accordance with the SC (Practice and Procedure) Act -- hereinafter referred to as the ""Act"".In a 2-1 majority verdict announced in September last year, a three-member bench had approved Imran Khan's petition, challenging the NAB law amendments made during the tenure of the previous PDM-led government.Subsequently, the federal government, filed an intra-court appeal against the Pakistan SC judgement in October, stating that the majority judgement suffers from ""procedural impropriety"" and is, therefore, ""liable to be set aside.""Following the amendments, the NAB was restricted to investigating any graft case worth less than Pakistrupees (PKR) 500 million. The accountability body's powers were also curtailed to probe into a fraud case unless its victims are more than 100.The amendments also modified the NAB law to keep an accused in its custody for a maximum of 14 days which was later exceeded to 30 days, Geo News reported.","Pakistan Supreme Court reinstated amendments made to the country's National Accountability Ordinance (NAO), overturning its own decision from last year.

"In rare verdict, Pakistan court orders removal of serving army general",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/in-rare-verdict-pakistan-court-orders-removal-of-serving-army-general/articleshow/113133171.cms,"In a rare verdict , A Pakistani court has ordered the removal of lieutenant general Munir Afsar on Friday, a serving general of Pakistan army , from his position as chairman of the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra).The Lahore high court ruled that Afsar's appointment was unauthorised and violated existing rules.The decision to annul Afsar's appointment came after a petition was filed by a citizen, Ashba Kamran.Afsar, who became the first serving military officer to head Nadra in October 2023, was initially appointed by a caretaker government and his term was later confirmed by the federal government for a three-year period lasting until 2027.Kamran's petition argued that Afsar's appointment contravened the Nadra Ordinance, 2000, and did not follow a fair and competitive process by inviting eligible candidates to apply. Justice Asim Hafiz, who delivered the verdict, noted that the process was illegal.""Lest anyone misunderstand this, we make it clear that the appointment to any post under the government can only be made after a proper advertisement has been made, inviting applications from eligible candidates. Without holding a proper selection where all eligible candidates get a fair chance to compete would violate the guarantee enshrined under Articles 18 and 27 of the Constitution,"" Hafiz said.""I am afraid that illegality committed by way of an unauthorized appointment, one cannot hide the elephant in a mouse-hole,"" the judge added.The ruling is considered unusual given the powerful role the Pakistan army has traditionally played in the country, including periods of military rule in its more than 75 years of existence.Experts say the high court's decision might be seen as a setback for those who support the current regime, as the military often seeks to place its personnel in major civil positions.",Afsar became the first serving military officer to head Nadra in October 2023.
