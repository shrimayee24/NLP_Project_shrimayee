New Delhi: While terror strikes understandably dominate news headlines and public discourse for days, the sustained and tireless efforts and operations by the security agencies to foil terror plots and nip attack conspiracies in the bud, may pass off without due notice.For instance, the six months preceding the Delhi car blast have seen several actions by the agencies - against Khalistani terrorism, IS-linked terror conspiracies, anti-narcotics crackdown, and al-Qaida ideology-inspired radicalisation modules.The month of May saw a Babbar Khalsa International (BKI) module busted in Batla on May 20 in an intelligence-based action, leading to the arrest of six members linked to foreign handlers and a Pakistan-based mastermind.Similarly, on May 19, intelligence teams in Hyderabad arrested two IS-linked terror suspects with explosives. Earlier on May 11, a Jamaat ul Mujahideen-Lashkar-e-Taiba network linked to Pakistan was busted in West Bengal.In July, Gujarat ATS and partner agencies busted an Al Qaeda in Indian State (AQIS) module promoting 'Ghazwa e Hind' with connections across Gujarat, UP and Delhi. On July 11, terror hideouts in Poonch, J&K were raided by the Army and J&K police, leading to discovery of terrorist hideouts and recovery of IEDs, grenades etc.August saw NIA apprehending Vizianagaram module case accused Arif Hussain alias Abu Talib at IGI airport in New Delhi; he was involved in conspiracy to supply weapons via Nepal border. August also saw anti-Sikh terror actions with the busting of BKI-Bishnoi gang modules in Punjab and Rajasthan.In September, UP ATS arrested four persons for attempting to form a radical organisation called the Mujahideen Army, with an aim to overthrow the elected govt through violent jihad and assassinate Hindu religious figures. Also, Delhi Police special cell busted a pan-India terror module and arrested five terrorists.In October, a border arms and opium network was exposed in Punjab; a JeM module active in Andhra Pradesh, UP and Maharashtra neutralised; and 2.5 kg IED seized in Punjab. On Oct 27, an IS module 'Saut-ul-Ummah' was busted by special cell of Delhi police and two terrorists arrested.","Security agencies have dismantled many terror networks in past six months. These include Khalistani terrorism, IS-linked terror conspiracies, anti-narcotics crackdown, and al-Qaida ideology-inspired radicalisation modules. The month of May saw a Babbar Khalsa International (BKI) module busted in Batla.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125312784,imgsize-63762,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

BJP's 'response loading' clip



NEW DELHI: United States secretary of state Marco Rubio on Thursday said the repercussion of the Delhi car bomb blast has the ""potential of becoming something broader"" as he acknowledged the explosion near Red Fort was a “heinous terror incident. ”Rubio has said the Hyundai i20 explosion near Red Fort was “clearly” a terrorist attack and commended India for being “very measured” and “very professional” in the way it is investigating the deadly incident.A high-intensity blast outside the Red Fort in Delhi on Monday claimed at least 13 lives. India on Wednesday termed the car explosion as a “heinous terror incident.”“Yeah, we’re aware of the potential that that holds. But I think the Indians are – need to be commended; they have been very measured and cautious and very professional in how they’re carrying out this investigation,” Rubio said Wednesday in remarks to the press in Canada' Hamilton.“That investigation continues. Clearly, it was a terrorist attack. It was a car loaded with highly explosive materials that detonated and killed a lot of people,” Rubio said.When asked how concerned he was about rising tensions between India and Pakistan, against the backdrop of the four-day conflict between the two neighbours in May, Rubio said: “(But) I think they’re doing a very good job of carrying out an investigation; and I think when they have facts, they’ll release those facts.”India had launched Operation Sindoor targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan in retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack. The on-ground hostilities ended with an understanding of stopping the military actions following talks between the directors general of military operations of both sides on May 10.“But clearly, ... we’re aware of the potential that it has, and so we spoke about that a little bit today – the potential that it has to become something broader. But I think we’re going to wait and see what their investigation reveals,” Rubio said, according to news agency PTI.Rubio also met External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on the margins of the G7 Foreign Ministers Meeting in Niagara.He added that the US has offered to help, but “I think they’re very capable in these investigations. They don’t need our help. They’re doing a good job, and I thought they were very measured and professional in how they’ve approached it, as they usually are.”Following his meeting with Rubio, Jaishankar said in a post on X: “Good to meet @SecRubio this morning at #G7 FMM. Appreciate his condolences on the loss of lives in the blast in Delhi. Discussed our bilateral ties, focusing on trade and supply chains. Exchanged views on the Ukraine conflict, the Middle East/West Asia situation and Indo-Pacific.”Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said that those responsible for the Delhi car blast won't be spared and will be brought to justice. PM Modi, who was on a two-day visit to Bhutan, said that he monitored the situation all night after the blast.""Today, I come here with a very heavy heart. The horrific incident that took place in Delhi yesterday evening has deeply saddened everyone. I understand the grief of the affected families. The entire nation stands with them today,"" he said.The Prime Minister added that he was in touch with all agencies investigating the incident.""I was in touch with all the agencies investigating this incident throughout last night. Our agencies will get to the bottom of this conspiracy. The conspirators behind this will not be spared. All those responsible will be brought to justice,"" he added.Union home minister Amit Shah also on Thursday said that those responsible for the recent Delhi bomb blast will be given the “strictest possible punishment”.He added that the action will send a strong message to the world that no one should ever dare to attack India again.The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday posted a clip of how India responded to every terror attack with a cross-border surgical strike, airstrike, and Operation Sindoor, which was launched to avenge the April 22 Pahalgam terrorist attack.In a drastic revision of its security doctrine, India, in May, after the Pahalgam attack, declared that it would from now on consider every instance of terrorism directed against it as an 'act of war' and would respond accordingly.Sources explained that the decision considerably lowers the threshold for India to give a full-scale military response to attacks orchestrated from across the border.","U.S. secretary of state Marco Rubio said the repercussion of the Delhi car bomb blast has the ""potential of becoming something broader"" Rubio has said the Hyundai i20 explosion near Red Fort was “clearly” a terrorist attack.

CJI on '79 rape ruling: 'Moment of institutional embarrassment'

'No Remorse, God Provoked Me': Lawyer Rakesh Kishore Defends His Shoe Attack On CJI BR Gavai

NEW DELHI: Admitting that Supreme Court failed its citizens, and it is the vigilance of civil society and courage of ordinary people which have kept the judiciary accountable over the years, the CJI termed SC's 1979 verdict as a ""moment of institutional embarrassment"" which acquitted two policemen accused of raping a young tribal girl inside a police station by taking her ""consent"" as voluntary because there were no visible marks of physical resistance.Delivering the 30th Justice Sunanda Bhandare Memorial Lecture, CJI B R Gavai said the apex court's verdict in Tukaram v. State of Maharashtra, also known as the Mathura case, was an institutional failure, and court's verdict reflected a deeply regressive and patriarchal understanding of consent, effectively denying the social context of power, coercion, and vulnerability in which sexual violence often occurs.""In my view, this decision remains one of the most troubling moments in India's constitutional and judicial history, and I call it a 'moment of institutional embarrassment', where the legal system failed to protect the dignity of the very person it was meant to safeguard. Yet, this judgment also became a turning point. The public outrage and the nationwide protests that followed, led by women's groups, students, and legal activists, ignited the modern Indian women's rights movement.It compelled the nation to confront the inadequacies of its criminal law and catalysed the amendments in criminal law, which redefined the concept of consent and strengthened legal protections against custodial rape,"" CJI Gavai said.The CJI was speaking on the evolution of law in building a gender equal and inclusive India. He said many pathbreaking laws were passed to bring gender justice, and courts also pitched in to ensure equality through judicial pronouncements, barring few exceptions like the 1979 verdict. He said it resulted in dismantling of the structural inequalities embedded in family and custom, bringing women from the margins of dependency to the centre of constitutional citizenship.""Over the past 75 years, India has charted an extraordinary journey in advancing the rights of women and shaping the vision of an inclusive society. From the early struggles for recognition and equality, to the present era of intersectional and participatory justice, the courts have often stood as guardians of equality and human dignity. This evolution has not been without its challenges. There have been moments when judicial interpretations failed to capture the lived realities of women or fell short of the transformative spirit of the Constitution. .. However, the vigilance of civil society, the persistence of women's movements, and the courage of ordinary citizens have together kept the judiciary accountable to the constitutional promise of equality,"" he said.""Therefore, it is important to acknowledge that progress in gender justice has never been the achievement of courts alone. The collective voice of citizens has ensured that regressive precedents were questioned, debated, and ultimately corrected through reform, reinterpretation, or legislative intervention. The dialogue between the courts and the people thus remains one of the most vital sources of India's democratic strength, reminding us that the march toward gender equality is not a destination reached, but a commitment constantly renewed,"" CJI Gavai said.","CJI BR Gavai says Supreme Court failed its citizens, and it is the vigilance of civil society and courage of ordinary people which have kept the judiciary accountable. He was speaking on the evolution of law in building a gender equal and inclusive India.

All 24 injured in blast near RedFort being treated at LNJP; No discharges or referrals madeNew Delhi: A critically injured patient on a ventilator succumbed to his injuries on Thursday morning, taking the toll in Monday's blast to 13.Doctors at Delhi govt's Lok Nayak Hospital (LNJP) confirmed the death of Bilal (35), who, according to police, lived near Jama Masjid. However, some sources said that he was a resident of Kangan in Ganderbal, Jammu & Kashmir.Among the most severely injured victims brought to the hospital after the explosion, Bilal suffered an abdominal-penetrating injury along with nearly 70% burns, said a senior doctor who was involved in his treatment.He underwent surgery on Wednesday after shrapnel from the blast ruptured multiple internal organs. ""Despite the surgical intervention, his condition remained extremely critical, and he could not survive,"" the doctor added.All 24 injured are being treated by LNJP multidisciplinary teams, hospital authorities said. Six of them continue to remain critical, as teams of doctors fight to stabilise them amid one of the hospital's most challenging emergency responses in recent times.""There have been no discharges or referrals to other facilities as we have all experts and faculties here,"" an official said.Doctors performed another complex surgery on a patient on Wednesday to remove a piece of shrapnel that pierced his eye. ""The patient had a head injury and a sharp foreign object punctured and was lodged inside the eye, damaging the cornea,"" said a doctor.Since the patient was too critical to be shifted to Guru Nanak Eye Centre, a team of ophthalmic surgeons from the eye hospital was brought to LNJP instead. ""Eye surgeries require an operating microscope. We planned and conducted the procedure in the neuro operation theatre, where such microscopes are available,"" a senior surgeon said.The operation was successful, and the shrapnel was removed. ""The cornea has been repaired,"" the surgeon added.Ophthalmologists have now joined the existing team of surgeons drawn from general surgery, burns and plastic, orthopaedics, neurosurgery, anaesthesia and ENT departments.Over 50 doctors and support staff have been working round the clock in LNJP's 70-bed disaster ward since Monday night. The unit was activated within minutes of the explosion, and has treated victims with severe burns, fractures, head injuries and blast-related trauma.Speaking about the pattern of injuries, doctors said two kinds of trauma are common among blast victims - burns and ear injuries. ""Most have superficial-to-deep burns, especially on the face and extremities. Many suffer ruptured eardrums or temporary hearing loss due to the shockwave,"" a medic said.At least four patients were treated for pneumothorax - a condition in which a blast's shockwave causes air to leak into the chest cavity, leading to the lung collapsing. Several others suffered eardrum ruptures and pellet wounds, while a few had to undergo emergency amputations.The hospital has set up a temporary facility near the emergency ward to accommodate up to two relatives per patient. They will be given food.","A critically injured patient on a ventilator succumbed to his injuries on Thursday morning, taking the toll in Monday's blast to 13.

A day-long trail through Delhi

Meticulous planning revealed by CCTV mapping

NEW DELHI: Fresh CCTV visuals have provided new insights into the movements of Dr Umar Nabi, the main accused in Monday’s deadly explosion near Delhi’s Red Fort that killed 13 people and injured several others.According to PTI, the footage shows Umar entering the national capital through the Badarpur toll plaza around 8.02 am on November 10, driving a white Hyundai i20 later identified as the vehicle that exploded near the Red Fort that evening.Investigators said Umar, wearing a mask, was seen handing cash to the toll operator while repeatedly glancing toward the CCTV camera. A large bag, believed to have contained explosives, was spotted on the car’s back seat.Another clip, reportedly from a lane near a mosque close to Ramlila Maidan, shows Umar walking along a narrow stretch before turning briefly — the moment his face is clearly visible on camera. Police believe he visited the mosque to offer prayers before driving toward the Red Fort. “His repeated glances toward the CCTV camera suggest that he knew agencies were looking for him, and he was consciously monitoring his surroundings,” a senior police officer told PTI.Delhi Police have retrieved footage from over 50 cameras showing Umar’s car travelling through several districts before the explosion. He was first captured on the Delhi–Mumbai Expressway. Umar stopped for a meal at a roadside eatery and spent the night in his car before entering the capital the next morning.From there, his route covered multiple areas: from Southeast Delhi to the East and Central districts, then northward to Ashok Vihar in the Northwest District, where he stopped to eat. The footage later shows him returning to central Delhi and visiting a mosque near Asaf Ali Road before heading towards the Red Fort parking lot at 3:19 pm.Another CCTV footage showed Umar at Mewat Toll, Haryana, on 10 November.PTI reported that the white i20 was later seen in the Sunehri Masjid parking area, where it remained stationary for nearly three hours. Around 6:22 pm, the car exited the parking lot and was last seen moving toward the Red Fort Metro Station side. Barely half an hour later, at 6:52 pm, it exploded into a fireball amid evening traffic, shattering nearby windows and setting off panic in the area.Investigators have reconstructed Umar’s movements in detail, suggesting he travelled from Haryana to Delhi via the Delhi–Mumbai Expressway. Police sources said Umar halted several times on his journey — once at a roadside dhaba where he ate and another time at a mosque where he offered prayers. He reportedly spent the night inside his car before entering Delhi on Monday morning. “He seemed to have planned every step, including his entry and exit routes, to avoid detection,” a police source told PTI.The footage shows that Umar deliberately avoided arterial roads, instead navigating through crowded lanes and smaller routes to confuse surveillance or observe public movement. He appeared calm throughout, even stopping at eateries. Police believe he used these pauses to check his phone and possibly receive instructions.ANI also reported that Umar’s diaries, recovered alongside those of co-accused Dr Muzammil, mention dates between November 8 and 12 — suggesting the planning phase for the attack. The diaries reportedly list about 25 individuals, many from Jammu and Kashmir and Faridabad, hinting at a wider conspiracy.Forensic experts have since confirmed through DNA testing that Dr Umar Nabi was indeed driving the Hyundai i20 at the time of the explosion. His mother’s DNA sample, collected on Tuesday, matched remains retrieved from the blast site. “The DNA results confirm that it was indeed Umar who was driving the fateful vehicle,” a source told PTI.",Dr Umar Nabi is the main accused in Monday's deadly explosion near Delhi’s Red Fort that killed 13 people and injured several others.

‘Only Agencies Know the Truth’: Brother of Delhi Blast Accused Breaks Silence

NEW DELHI: Two days after the deadly car blast near Delhi’s Red Fort, new revelations from the family of arrested doctor Shaheen Sayeed have added a personal dimension to the ongoing terror investigation.Speaking to PTI in Lucknow, Mohammad Shoaib, Shaheen’s elder brother, has said the family is in “complete disbelief” over her alleged link to terrorist activities. He added that they were still struggling to come to terms with the accusations.He confirmed that the police and Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) officials had searched their home but behaved respectfully.“They searched the house and asked questions normally, the same way you are asking me now,” Shoaib said.“Neither my father nor I were treated harshly. There was no pressure or force used to make us say anything. They only asked about when my sister stopped visiting us.”Shoaib revealed that the family had not been in contact with Shaheen for the past four years. However, their parents occasionally called to check on her well-being.“We have had no contact. It’s been four years since we last spoke. Parents will naturally call their children to ask how they are doing.I am her elder brother, of course, I would also worry about her. Isn’t that normal?” he said.When asked if he had ever visited her residence near IIM Road in Lucknow, Shoaib replied: “No, I have never gone there. I only knew that she has a house somewhere along the IIM Road. I don’t even know the exact location.”He said there was never any reason to suspect her of wrongdoing.“Even when she was studying medicine, there was never any sign of her being involved in anything suspicious. I still don’t believe these allegations. As I have said before, I simply cannot believe it,” he said.Shaheen’s former husband, Dr Zafar Hayat, who lives in Kanpur, also expressed shock over her alleged role in the case. He said he learned about her arrest only a day earlier.Hayat and Shaheen married in November 2003 and got divorced in 2012. Both were doctors, and he recalled her as “a loving mother and caring person.”“Our divorce took place towards the end of 2012. I am not sure what was on her mind that led to it. There was never any dispute or quarrel between us. She was a loving and caring person,” he said.“I never had any inkling that she could be involved in such activities. She was deeply attached to her family and children, loved them immensely and took care of their studies,” Hayat added.Recalling their marriage, he said: “I had never seen her in a burqa.

Our divorce happened long ago, in 2012, and if she got involved in something later, I know nothing about it.”He also remembered a conversation they once had about settling abroad.Dr Hayat recalled that Shaheen had once suggested settling in Australia or Europe for better pay and quality of life; however, he told her that they already had good jobs and a comfortable life in India, surrounded by family and friends.Hayat said he was unaware that Shaheen had returned to India and maintained that she showed no signs of any extremist beliefs during their years together.According to investigators, Dr Shaheen Sayeed, associated with Al-Falah University in Faridabad, was among those arrested following Monday’s explosion near the Red Fort.Police suspect she was linked to Dr Muzammil Ganaie, another faculty member at the same university, alleged to be part of a “white-collar terror module” with ties to Jaish-e-Mohammed and Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind.Authorities said the module spread across Kashmir, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh was exposed after the recovery of 2,900 kg of explosives and the arrest of eight people, including three doctors from Al-Falah University.Investigators claim that Shaheen headed Jaish-e-Mohammed’s women’s recruitment wing, Jamaat-ul-Mominat in India.Her father, Syed Ahmad Ansari also expressed shock at the allegations.“I last spoke to Shaheen about a month ago. I have never heard her mention Dr Muzammil or anyone involved in such activities,” he said.Her father added that she had completed her medical studies in Prayagraj.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) is probing the Red Fort blast which police said was caused by a high-intensity explosive device planted in a car.Investigations by police teams across Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh are continuing into the wider multi-state module.The explosion occurred around 7 pm on Monday at the Subhash Marg traffic signal, near the Red Fort Metro Station. The high-intensity blast ripped through a slow-moving Hyundai i20 car, killing at least 12 people and injuring several others.","Mohammad Shoaib, Shaheen Sayeed's elder brother, says family is in 'complete disbelief' Says family had not been in contact with her for past four years.

NEW DELHI: Umar Un Nabi, confirmed by a DNA test as the bomber in Old Delhi, and his module had planned to carry out a ""spectacular terror attack "" with multiple vehicle-borne IEDs followed by firing with assault rifles. They had procured three vehicles - an i20, a red Ford Ecosport and a Brezza - for their mission, sources in the security establishment said on Wednesday.While the i20 exploded, cops issued a BOLO (be on the lookout) notice for the other two cars, an indication that more explosives may have been hidden by the module. The Ecosport, which has a Delhi registration number ending in 0458, was located Wednesday in Faridabad. A search is on for the Brezza. The cars were allegedly procured by Umar.The probe so far has revealed that besides Delhi, they were planning to target Ayodhya too. An attempt was to be made on Nov 25 during the hoisting of a saffron flag atop the Ram temple, said a source in a security agency. The suspects have revealed they were planning to use, and had collected, a mixture of ammonium nitrate and RDX, but it's unclear if that was the explosive in the car.The plot was hatched in Turkiye way back in 2022. As reported by TOI on Wednesday, Umar was acting on instructions from his Turkiye-based handler, identified by his codename Ukasa.A day after a car blast killed a dozen people near Red Fort, home minister Amit Shah chaired a set of meetings with the security brass and instructed agencies to hunt down every culprit behind the act.""Everyone involved in this act will face the full wrath of our agencies,"" Shah posted on X after the meetings.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the home minister from Bhutan and was briefed by the latter on all aspects of the blast, including the investigation updates. President Droupadi Murmu, who is in Angola, also spoke to Shah over the phone to enquire about the blast.The home minister on Tuesday decided to hand over the investigation into the incident to the National Investigation Agency (NIA). This points to a terror angle, though sources said it may have more to do with the Jaish terror module member linked to the blast.With Dr Umar, who had escaped the recent crackdown on the Faridabad module, suspected to be the car bomber, Shah has asked the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) to match the DNA sample collected from the body found in the i20 car used for the blast with those of Dr Umar's family members.Sources in the J&K security establishment told TOI that DNA samples collected from Dr Umar's family members had been despatched to Delhi. Shah has asked FSL officials to complete the exercise at the earliest. The NIA was instructed to submit a report at the earliest, detailing the preliminary findings.Tuesday's review meetings by Shah were attended by home secretary Govind Mohan, director of Intelligence Bureau Tapan Deka, Delhi Police commissioner Satish Golcha and NIA DG Sadanand Vasant Date.DGP of Jammu and Kashmir Nalin Prabhat joined the meeting virtually.During the meetings, top officials gave detailed presentations on the situation in the aftermath of the blast, the sources said.","Umar Un Nabi, confirmed by a DNA test as the bomber in Old Delhi, and his module had planned to carry out a ""spectacular terror attack "" with multiple vehicle- borne IEDs.

SRINAGAR: Counting of votes began on Friday morning for the Nagrota assembly bypoll, marking the final leg of a high-stakes electoral contest that saw over 75% voter turnout earlier this week.Voting was held on Tuesday amid tight security arrangements, with polling officials describing the exercise as largely peaceful and enthusiastic.According to Election Commission data, Nagrota recorded 75.08% polling, slightly lower than the 77.66% turnout registered during the 2024 assembly elections.The bypoll was necessitated after the death of BJP MLA Devender Singh Rana in October last year. His daughter, Devyani Rana, is contesting as the BJP candidate, hoping to ride a wave of sympathy and her late father’s goodwill.The triangular contest features BJP’s Devyani Rana, National Conference (NC) candidate and sitting DDC member Shamim Begum, and Jammu and Kashmir National Panthers Party (JKNPP) president Harsh Dev Singh, a seasoned politician and former state education minister.Devyani, an economics graduate from the University of California and a business entrepreneur, has campaigned on the promise of “professional and inclusive development” while invoking her father’s legacy of progress in Nagrota.Her key rival, Shamim Begum, has relied on grassroots mobilisation and the NC’s organisational strength, promising continuity in governance and a focus on women’s empowerment. Meanwhile, Harsh Dev Singh — contesting Nagrota for the first time — has projected himself as a viable alternative to both national parties, emphasising his legislative experience and local connect.A total of 97,980 voters were eligible to decide the fate of 10 candidates in the bypoll. Long queues were seen at polling stations like Kol Kandoli, where voters turned up early to cast their votes.Nagrota has alternated between the BJP and NC in the last five Assembly elections since 1996. Interestingly, the Congress chose to stay away, neither fielding a candidate nor officially joining the NC campaign, despite being part of a broader opposition alliance in the Union Territory.With counting underway under tight security, all eyes are now on whether the Rana family’s political legacy continues or if Nagrota scripts a surprise verdict in this closely watched contest.","Counting of votes began on Friday morning for the Nagrota assembly bypoll.

Japan To Attack China To Free Taiwan? Shock Clash Erupts As Beijing Threatens Japanese PM





SHANGHAI: Infuriated by comments about Taiwan by Japan's new Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, China has unleashed a stream of vitriol, including a threat by a Chinese diplomat to cut off the leader's ""filthy head. ""The abuse abruptly ended a honeymoon between Takaichi, in office for less than a month, and China. She had met China's top leader, Xi Jinping , just last month in South Korea, with the two leaders warmly shaking hands and smiling.It also ended China's turn away from so-called wolf warrior diplomacy, an aggressive, in-your-face approach to foreign relations that took shape after Xi rose to power in Beijing in 2012 but had largely faded in recent years.Relations between China and Japan have for decades been prone to intemperate feuds fueled largely by bitter Chinese memories of World War II , when the Japanese army committed multiple atrocities, including the 1937 Nanjing Massacre, crimes for which Beijing believes Tokyo has never sufficiently apologised.The latest eruption between the two Asian powers began Friday with Takaichi's response to a question in parliament about potential ""survival-threatening situations,"" a classification that, under Japanese law, allows the deployment of the country's military forces.Takaichi said that an attempt by China to blockade or seize Taiwan, which lies less than 70 miles from Japanese territory and sits astride shipping lanes vital for Japan's economic survival, could constitute such a situation. China considers Taiwan, a self-governed democracy, part of its territory.""If it involves the use of warships and the use of force, I believe that this could constitute an existential threat, no matter how you look at it,"" she told parliament.On Monday, she recalibrated slightly, saying that her comments did not constitute a change in government policy.China's foreign ministry, unsatisfied, demanded that she retract her remarks, complaining Thursday that she had ""remained unrepentant."" A spokesperson cited ""innumerable crimes"" by Japan during its colonial rule of Taiwan before 1945 and what it said was its repeated use of ""the so-called 'crisis of survival' as a pretext to launch foreign aggression.""Hu Xijin, a prominent Chinese nationalist, denounced Takaichi on social media as ""an evil witch"" who had ""successfully ignited a new explosion of mutual hatred between Chinese and Japanese public opinion.""China's state broadcaster, China Central Television, ran a commentary this week warning that Japanese leaders who interfere in Taiwan are ""doomed to dig their own graves.""""Those who ignite the fire will be burned by it,"" the commentary added, likening Takaichi's reference to ""survival-threatening situations"" to Japan's 1931 invasion of Manchuria in northeastern China.Though not a significant revision of Japan's long-standing position of support for Taiwan, Takaichi's initial comment broke with previous policy of avoiding any explicit mention of Taiwan in the context of ""survival-threatening situations."" Like the United States, a close military ally, Japan had previously stuck to a policy of strategic ambiguity that left its intentions vague with relation to any future Chinese military attack on Taiwan.Even Shinzo Abe , the former Japanese prime minister who was Takaichi's political mentor and shared hawkish views on China, had avoided detailing how Japan might respond to a crisis over Taiwan. In recent years, Japanese leaders have repeated a vague expression of solidarity: ""A Taiwan crisis is Japan's crisis.""China is particularly sensitive to Japanese statements on Taiwan. Japan ruled the island from 1895 until 1945 as its colonial power and left behind an educated elite that often felt closer to Japan than China. Taiwan's first democratically elected president, Lee Teng-hui, who spoke fluent Japanese and presided over the island's transition to full democracy in the 1990s, was routinely denounced by Beijing as a Japanese agent.Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a political scientist in Hong Kong and the author of ""Facing China: The Prospect for War and Peace,"" described this week's Sino-Japanese ruckus as a ""clear return to wolf warrior diplomacy."" What Japan's prime minister told parliament, he added, ""is the truth: If China attacks Taiwan, it will be impossible for Japan to stay out of the conflict. Just look at the map.""In response to Takaichi's remarks, Xue Jian, China's consul general in Osaka, Japan, said in a post written in Japanese on social media platform X: ""That filthy head that has come charging forward on its own accord will have to be cut off without a moment's hesitation. Are you prepared for that?""Senior political figures in both governing and opposition parties in Japan interpreted that as a death threat and demanded Xue's expulsion.Referring to Xue's message, the U.S. ambassador in Tokyo, George Glass, posted his own message. ""The mask slips -- again,"" the ambassador wrote. ""Time for Beijing to behave like the 'good neighbor' it talks repeatedly about -- but fails repeatedly to become.""The Chinese diplomat in Osaka deleted his post.Takaichi, Japan's first female prime minister, has been a vocal defender of Taiwan. She met with a representative of the island at the regional summit in South Korea, drawing criticism from Chinese officials.","Japan's new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi angered China with comments about Taiwan.

Almost every district in Kyiv was under a 'massive' attack Friday morning, mayor Vitaly Klitschko said as Russia intensified its attacks on infrastructure.At least 11 people were wounded, five of whom were hospitalised, including a pregnant woman and a man in “extremely serious condition”.Moscow, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, has particularly targeted Ukrainian energy facilities and rail systems, as well as residential areas in recent months.Missiles and drones were targeting critical infrastructure facilities in the capital on Friday, said Mykola Kalashnyk, the head of the Kyiv regional military administration.Kyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko called it a “massive enemy attack”, saying air defence forces were in operation.“Sections of heating networks were damaged,” he said, with some buildings in north-eastern Desnyansky district temporarily left without heat. Electricity and water supplies could also be disrupted, he added.“Russians are hitting residential buildings. There are a lot of damaged high-rise buildings throughout Kyiv, almost in every district,” Tymur Tkachenko, the head of the city’s military administration, wrote on social media.Klitschko reported fires or damage to buildings in eight of Kyiv’s 10 districts, saying medical emergency teams were deployed to all of them.A fire broke out on the roof of a five-storey residential building in Solomyansky district, a transport hub near Kyiv’s international airport.The attack comes as Kyiv’s Western allies ratcheted up pressure on Russia. On Wednesday, Canada unveiled new sanctions targeting Russia’s drone and energy production, as well as infrastructure used to launch cyberattacks.G7 foreign ministers that day called for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine, voicing “unwavering” support for the country’s territorial integrity. The European Commission is considering using part of Russia’s assets frozen after its invasion to provide Kyiv with a loan for budgetary and military support over the next two years.But after almost four years of war, both sides are heavily entrenched with Moscow rejecting ceasefire calls and efforts by US President Donald Trump to revive a long-stalled peace deal. Russian forces have been grinding across eastern Ukraine for months, trying to take control of the Donetsk and Lugansk regions. Russia said Monday it had captured three more villages along the sprawling front line, where it is pressing its advantage in manpower and equipment.Experts say Russia’s latest strikes on energy infrastructure are putting Ukraine at risk of heating outages ahead of the winter months.","At least 11 people were wounded, five of whom were hospitalised, including a pregnant woman and a man in ‘extremely serious condition’ Moscow has particularly targeted Ukrainian energy facilities and rail systems.

Just months after its opening, a portion of a highway bridge in China’s Sichuan province collapsed on Tuesday, giving in to a combination of a landslide and apparent structural weakness.The Hongqi bridge in Maerkang, is a 758-metre-long span on a national highway designed to improve travel between Sichuan, China’s central regions, and Tibet, Reuters reported.Footage from the scene shows debris slamming onto the bridge, with part of the span breaking away and falling into the river below. A large plume of dust rose from the collapse site as rubble scattered across the surrounding valley.The bridge was only completed earlier this year, a milestone that the contractor, Sichuan Road & Bridge Group, shared in a video posted on social media.Local authorities confirmed that the incident occurred when landslides struck a mountainside overlooking the structure.However, there were no casualties as the bridge was already closed to traffic before the collapse.Police had shut the structure on Monday afternoon after engineers spotted cracks on slopes and nearby roads, and detected shifts in the mountain terrain above the bridge. Officials in Maerkang said that the closure decision was taken as soon as the cracks and ground movement were detected, and that worsening instability on Tuesday directly led to the collapse, New York Post reported.According to the local government, conditions deteriorated rapidly the following day.On Tuesday afternoon, the weakening mountainside gave way, triggering landslides that destroyed the approach bridge and roadbed.The destroyed bridge section was part of a key highway link intended to ease travel between Sichuan, China’s interior, and the Tibetan Plateau.","A portion of a highway bridge in China's Sichuan province collapsed on Tuesday, giving in to a combination of a landslide and apparent structural weakness.

Nikki Haley Warns Donald Trump of ‘Strategic Disaster’ as 50% US Tariff on India Nears Deadline





Amid the ongoing Christian-Hinduism controversy, Nalin Haley , the son of former US ambassador to UN Nikki Haley, has spoken about his unique journey in finding his faith in a multi-faith family. In an interview with UnHerd, the 24-year-old Indian-origin MAGA voice said he was confused over religion in his childhood. His maternal grandparents who were almost his surrogate parents, followed Sikhism while his parents were Protestant Christians.Haley said he immersed himself in books on world religions to find out what he should follow when other kids of his age were reading about cars and dinosaurs. Eventually, he concluded that Christianity is the true faith but the conclusion was preceded by a spiritual experience that he did not detail in the interview.“I needed to research my own faith better in terms of the history, the early beliefs, the Church Fathers,” he said. “When I did that, I felt as though anyone who does that kind of research will walk away a Catholic.”The interview comes as Hindu Indian-origin politicians in the US are facing unprecedented attacks over their religion. Vice President JD Vance recently said he would like to see his wife Usha Vance converted to Christianity.Though JD clarified that Usha Vance has no intention of converting, the episode showed how MAGA is Christian nationalists at core and unapologetic about it.Haley said he chose his political path too in a similar fashion. I was not just going to have the same political views as my parents,” he said adding that he supported Nikki Haley in the 2024 Republican primary only to be a ""good son"". “I didn’t and was never going to be an advocate for a view that I did not have,"" he said. Like he thinks the US should stop legal immigration as well, though he himself belongs to an immigrant family.","Nalin Haley, the son of former US ambassador to UN Nikki Haley, has spoken about his unique journey in finding his faith in a multi-faith family.

Conservative commentator Megyn Kelly made a disturbing defence for Jeffrey Epstein as she suggested that she did not initially believe that Epstein was an actual pedophile because the reported victims were not children, but 15 and older, hitting their puberty. Kelly made the shocking statement as she spoke to journalist Batya Ungar-Sargon about Epstein on Wednesday after Democrats released emails suggesting President Donald Trump ""knew about the girls"" during his friendship with Epstein.""I do know somebody very, very close to this case who is in a position to know virtually everything,"" Kelly explained. ""And this person has told me from the start, years and years ago, that Jeffrey Epstein, in this person's view, was not a pedophile.""""This is this person's view, who was there for a lot of this, but that he was into the barely legal type. Like, he liked 15-year-old girls,"" Kelly said. ""I'm just giving you facts that he wasn't into, like, 8-year-olds. But he liked the very young teen types that could pass for even younger than they were, but would look legal to a passerby.""Megyn Kelly acknowledged that she was wrong and she started to change her opinion after ttorney General Pam Bondi claimed that Epstein had thousands of videos with child sexual abuse material.""For the first time, I thought, oh, no, he was an actual pedophile,"" Kelly said. ""I don't know whether it's true. I have to be honest, I don't really trust Pam Bondi's word on the Epstein matters anymore.""""You can say that's a distinction without a difference. I think there is a difference. There's a difference between a 15-year-old and a 5-year-old, you know?"" she added. ""The whole thing is just disgusting.""The comment backfired and many called it ""career ending"". ""This is career-ending for Megyn Kelly. 15 year olds are CHILDREN. They can’t drive.

'American Dream Stolen': India in the Spotlight as Trump’s H-1B Visa Misuse Ad Sparks Controversy

MAGA divided; Trump administration controls damage









American YouTuber Tyler Oliveira, who spread Indian hatred through his documentary on the cow dung festival that he misrepresented as a 'poop-throwing festival', weighed in on the H-1B row and rubbished the narrative that America does not have enough talent. Oliveira called for abolishing the H-1B program and asked for more investment in American youth instead of foreigners. He said America landed on the moon 20 years before the H-1B program even existed, hence America does not need foreign talent.Tyler made several anti-India comments during the release of his cow dung festival documentary and claimed that he and his family members were attacked by Indians on social media.The H-1B comment came amid a major row over President Donald Trump's statement that America needs ""certain"" foreign talent.“Certain talents are not available to you. People have to learn them. You can’t take people receiving unemployment benefits and put them to work in a missile factory. Talent must be brought in,"" Trump said. “There were Koreans there who had been making batteries their entire lives. Making batteries is very complex and not easy.It’s highly dangerous, with frequent explosions and many problems. They planned to bring in about 500 to 600 people in the initial phase to make batteries and teach others how to do it. But they tried to deport them. You would need such people too,"" Trump said, giving an example of what he meant by ""certain"" talent.MAGA got clearly divided, with one section defending what Trump said while the other openly expressing their disappointment at Trump. The Trump administration controlled damage and said the crackdown on illegal immigration will go on, while Trump's idea is to bring foreign workers who will come legally, work for a few years in the US and then go back to their own countries.","American YouTuber Tyler Oliveira made a documentary on India's cow-dung festival.

A year before Ohio goes to the election to choose its governor, the pitch heats up with Republican candidate Indian-origin Vivek Ramaswamy and Democrat candidate Dr Amy Acton exchanging barbs. Acton re-upped Ramaswamy's 2024 post on H-1B and reminded the voters that Ramaswamy called Americans, including Ohioans, lazy and mediocre.""Vivek Ramaswamy told us how he really feels when he said that Ohioans aren't succeeding because they're lazy and mediocre and watching too much TV,"" Acton posted.""That couldn't be further from what I'm seeing on the ground every day. Ohioans are working harder than ever, they're doing everything right, and they just can't get enough breathing room. Ohio needs a governor who listens, understands, and who is ready to bring down costs on day one,"" Acton added.Ramaswamy, in his reply, referred to Dr Acton as Dr Lockdown and said she made Ohio shut down during Covid, leading to businesses suffering. ""Dr Lockdown led Ohio to be the *first* state in the nation to shut down public schools during Covid. Students suffered. Small businesses suffered. Families suffered. Now she wants to ruin our state again. She’s never coming anywhere near the levers of power in our state again,"" Ramaswany said.""Take a moment & hear Dr. Lockdown speak, in her own words.

Never again,"" Vivek made another post.Even a year after his controversial post, Vivek Ramaswamy is yet to come out of its shadow while a new H-1B controversy has started. And this time, President Donald Trump's statement is at the center of the row. Trump said America needs certain kinds of foreign skills and many experts observed that Vivek Ramaswamy, too, said the same thing last year.After burning his fingers in last year's controversy, Ramaswamy did not say anything on H-1B since the announcement of his gubernatorial bid. But he is still sidelined in MAGA who wants him to fail only because of his Indian origin. President Trump made it clear that Ramaswamy has his full endorsement, and the GOP will not change its candidate.A poll, conducted on behalf of the Ohio Federation of Teachers, recently claimed Acton has a higher favorability among Ohio likely voters, including a potentially key 21-point advantage among independent voters, but Ramaswamy's campaign has disputed these results.","Vivek Ramaswamy's rival reminds voters of last year's H-1B row.

Does America need H-1B?







Republican Congressman Chip Roy said he has a bill proposing the freezing of all immigration until the US achieves certain objectives, like reforms in the system, which he will introduce soon -- amid fresh H-1B controversy. The controversy stemmed from President Donald Trump's statement that America needs certain talents from outside which triggered a major row. A few weeks ago, the Donald Trump administration imposed a whopping $100,000 fee on H-1B visa programs, making it difficult for American companies to hire foreign nationals. Trump's latest statement is being seen as a softening of his stance, though the White House maintained that the crackdown on illegal immigration will continue.MAGA fault lines once again became evident as major MAGA activists condemned Trump's statement and claimed that Trump implied a lack of talent in America. Some MAGA exponents defended what Trump said and asserted that there indeed is a lack of some specialized skills in America.""Why are we importing any human being that is adhering to Sharia law which is totally contrary to the Constitution. We can amend the bill but I am going to introduce a framework why don't we just freeze immigration entirely until we sort this crap out.Until we figure out who’s here, why they’re here, how many Chinese communists, how many people who are Islamists who want to remake America, how many people are living on the public dole, living on welfare, going into the emergency room to get care, or in our education system getting taxpayer-funded education because the Supreme Court declared it so.

‘DIRTY DONALD!’: What’s Trump Hiding? All You Need To Know About BOMBSHELL Epstein Emails





In a head-spinning pivot from fiscal brinkmanship to scandalous revelations, the United States emerged from its longest government shutdown in history on Thursday only for Congress to unleash a fresh torrent of Jeffrey Epstein documents that ensnare President Donald Trump in a web of unflattering emails.The 43-day impasse, which furloughed 700,000 federal workers and shaved an estimated 0.1% off GDP weekly, concluded with a bipartisan sigh of relief, before a fresh tranche of the so-called Epstein files set the stage for potentially explosive hearings in the coming days on the late sex offender's ties with political elites, including President Trump.The shutdown's end came swiftly after weeks of partisan trench warfare after some half dozen Democratic legislators joined the narrow Republican majority in the House to offset the dissent of two GOP legislators for a 222-209 vote to end the shutdown.President Trump, who signed the legislation in the Oval Office late Wednesday night to re-open the government after the vote, ignored questions about the latest Epstein email disclosures by Democrats which had flooded social media by then, although he is typically happy to engage with the press at all times, often seeking out the media at all hours.Among the bombshells in the latest tranche is a 2011 email from the late sex predator to Ghislaine Maxwell , his convicted accomplice, calling Trump ""the dog that hasn't barked,"" and adding he ""spent hours at my house"" with a sex trafficking victim whose name was redacted but which is in public domain.The White House dismissed the disclosures as a ""fake narrative"" engineered by Democrats, with Trump tweeting: ""Epstein hoax—total distraction from our wins!"" Republicans countered the Democratic revelations with their own release of 20,000+ pages, highlighting Epstein's gripes about Trump's presidency and business dealings to suggest the late sex offender had an axe to grind.The clashing narrative came on the heels of a newly-elected Democratic legislator, Adelita Grijalva, whose swearing in, will add the one vote to the 218 required to force the House vote to release the full Epstein trove—estimated at 50,000 pages. The full stash is reported to be in the possession of the FBI and Justice Department. Material Democrats released on Wednesday were obtained from the Epstein estate in response to a subpoena from a congressional committee.Several Republican lawmakers are also said to support the release of the complete Epstein files in a revolt mirroring Democrats rebelling against their party on the issue of government shutdown.At least two pro-releasers, Lauren Bobbert and Nancy Mace, were reportedly summoned to the White House to convince them not to support the release. They are said to have resisted the pressure amid polls showing only 40% of Republicans approving Trump's handling of the Epstein affairs and a majority sentiment for full disclosure.Few people are holding their breath about anything in the files damaging President Trump’s teflon-coated image given all that sludge he has navigated. “People who think this new Epstein stuff is going to finally turn Trump’s cult against him… They are more likely to come around to the view: “You know, actually child rape is not so bad,” one Trump critic noted darkly on X.","The 43-day impasse, which furloughed 700,000 federal workers and shaved an estimated 0.1% off GDP weekly, concluded with a bipartisan sigh of relief.

Silence as verdict







Anyone who grew up in the 90s or has sat through The Hangover knows the relentless chant: Who let the dogs out? Often voted one of the most annoying songs of all time, it now finds unlikely relevance in Washington. This time, it was the House Democrats who let the “dog” out, specifically an email from Jeffrey Epstein calling Donald Trump “the dog that hasn’t barked.” Touted as a smoking gun, the message was meant to raise suspicions about Trump’s proximity to Epstein’s crimes. But in classic Washington fashion, the full context told a different story, one where the silence wasn’t guilt but the absence of it.On 12 November 2025, House Oversight Committee Democrats released three emails from Epstein’s estate that they claimed raised “glaring questions” about President Donald Trump’s involvement or knowledge of Epstein’s abuse network. The most headline-grabbing was a 2011 message from Epstein to Ghislaine Maxwell in which he wrote: “I want you to realise that that dog that hasn’t barked is Trump. [Victim] spent hours at my house with him… he has never once been mentioned. ”The implication, according to Democrats, was that Trump had spent time with one of Epstein’s victims, whose name they redacted, and that his lack of mention in interviews or investigations was suspicious.A second email from 2019, sent to author Michael Wolff, had Epstein claiming Trump “knew about the girls” and had once asked Maxwell to stop. A third, from 2015, saw Epstein and Wolff discussing how Trump might respond if asked about Epstein on CNN. Wolff’s advice: “Let him hang himself.”At first glance it looked explosive. But the closer the messages were read, the more they collapsed under their own weight. No accusation was made. No crime was alleged. No victim testimony was cited. The only thing that barked was political theatre.“The dog that hasn’t barked” is a literary nod to Sherlock Holmes, a clue defined by what doesn’t happen. In Conan Doyle’s Silver Blaze, Holmes deduces that a dog’s failure to react during a crime implies the criminal was familiar. Epstein, in his email, used the phrase to highlight that Trump’s name had never surfaced among victims, police, lawyers or investigators.The victim in question, later confirmed by Republicans as Virginia Giuffre, had consistently and publicly said that Trump never acted inappropriately with her. In depositions, interviews and her memoir, she described Trump as courteous, said he never behaved abusively and made clear she had no accusation to make.Seen in that light, Epstein’s message reads less like a warning and more like baffled irritation. He expected Trump’s name to appear. It never did. That silence, the one Epstein couldn’t explain, became the very thing Democrats tried to frame as damning. In reality it may be the strongest evidence that there was nothing to implicate.The committee’s release had another problem: selectivity. Oversight committees typically release full document batches unless classified or sealed. Instead, Democrats chose three isolated emails, heavy on redactions, knowing that anything linking “Trump” and “Epstein” would explode across social media and cable news within minutes.The political incentive was obvious. Headlines travel faster than context. A cryptic email from Epstein carries far more viral impact than a 500-page folder showing nothing else of substance.But the selectivity backfired when Republicans responded.Within hours of the Democratic release, House Republicans countered with over 20,000 pages from Epstein’s estate, the full tranche of documents. It included the unredacted version of the “dog” email, revealing the unnamed victim was Giuffre. It also included dozens of mentions of Trump, but these were social references, gossip, birthday notes and speculation. None were allegations. None were corroborated by victims, investigators or court filings.One email joked about photos of “Donald and girls in bikinis in my kitchen.” Another referenced Epstein supposedly giving Trump a 20-year-old girlfriend as a gift in 1993. Uncomfortable? Yes. Criminal? No. The GOP strategy was straightforward: show everything to reveal that Democrats had cherry-picked fragments designed to cause maximum political damage. And when the wider set was viewed in full, the fragments didn’t suggest conspiracy. They suggested proximity.The absence of key evidence is striking. The emails contain:The tone is conversational and speculative. Epstein complains, assumes and muses, but never provides information. In investigative terms, the emails lack every indicator that would normally accompany serious allegations.Under standard investigative thresholds, several pillars must exist for a case to have traction:None of these exist for Trump in Epstein’s record.During the SDNY and DOJ investigations into Epstein and Maxwell, prosecutors reviewed Trump’s intersection with the network. Nothing was found. Even civil lawyers, who operate under a lower burden of proof, never filed a claim involving Trump. This isn’t political exoneration. It is structural absence.A revealing dimension is Epstein’s psychology. By the late 2000s, he lived in a world where powerful men behaved like the ones who did get accused. He projected his own patterns onto others. He also believed fame always left traces. Trump was famous, wealthy and part of the same social circuit. Epstein thought that made him vulnerable.When victims did not mention Trump, it confused him. His “dog that hasn’t barked” line reflects that confusion. Epstein expected guilt by association. Reality did not cooperate.It is well documented that Trump and Epstein mixed in the same Palm Beach–New York circles in the 1990s and early 2000s. Trump once described Epstein as “a terrific guy” in a 2002 magazine profile, adding that Epstein liked “beautiful women… on the younger side.”By the mid-2000s their relationship had fractured. Trump has repeatedly claimed he banned Epstein from Mar-a-Lago for inappropriate behaviour toward young female staff. Others say it was a fight over a property deal. Either way, Trump has long insisted he cut ties before Epstein’s scandals erupted.Nothing in the newly released documents contradicts this timeline. In 2025 interviews, Maxwell reportedly said she never saw Trump act improperly and never recruited anyone for Epstein at Trump’s club.The media did what it has always done with anything combining Trump and Epstein: amplified first, clarified later. Screenshots went viral across Twitter before anyone read the full email chains. Cable news pushed insinuation. Headlines prioritised drama over detail. The follow-up corrections reached a fraction of the audience. In modern politics, innuendo always travels faster than nuance.A moral dimension sits beneath the politics. Survivors have long expressed anger that their trauma is deployed as a political weapon. Selective releases retraumatise victims while offering no path to accountability. Giuffre herself spent years publicly stating that Trump never harmed her, yet after her death her name re-entered the political arena.Several Republican congresswomen who are survivors of assault have demanded the release of all Epstein material in one transparent batch. Their argument is simple: truth does not come in curated fragments.If this was meant to damage Trump, it failed. The White House dismissed the emails as meaningless gossip. Trump labelled it a hoax. Republicans accused Democrats of exploiting the Epstein case for partisan gain.Still, the risk for Trump is not entirely neutralised. Epstein’s name continues to evoke discomfort across parts of the electorate. Old photographs, party footage and travel logs ensure the association never completely disappears.In politics, perception often outruns proof.The Epstein saga remains unfinished.Even if Trump faces no evidentiary threat, the political shadow persists.So, did the dog bark? No. But that is the point. Democrats tried to weaponise an ambiguous quote. What they released instead was Epstein expressing frustration that Trump had not been implicated. No allegation surfaced. No evidence emerged. A convicted predator wondered why one powerful man had escaped the storm. Sometimes silence is not suspicion. Sometimes silence is the verdict. And in the case of President Trump and Jeffrey Epstein, the dog that didn’t bark may have told us everything we need to know.","House Oversight Committee Democrats released three emails from Epstein’s estate that they claimed raised “glaring questions’ about President Donald Trump.

But Donald Trump's latest Fox News interview, in which he said America needs certain foreign talent, triggered a fresh row that has now boiled down into India-hate.Trump also specified which type of talent he was referring to. “In Georgia, they raided because they wanted illegal immigrants out — they had people from South Korea that made batteries all their life,” Trump said. “You know, making batteries is very complicated. It’s not an easy thing. Very dangerous, a lot of explosions, a lot of problems. They had like 500 or 600 people, early stages, to make batteries and to teach people how to do it.

Seven men have been charged with more than 40 offences against 11 teenagers after an investigation into child sexual exploitation in Bristol.The alleged offences took place between 2022 and 2025 when the victims were in their mid to late teens.Police said an investigation into claims of group-based sexual abuse in the city began in late 2023. The men were arrested in April 2024 and bailed, but were detained again yesterday and are due to appear at Bristol Magistrates’ Court this morning.The seven charged are:• Mohamed Arafe, 19, who is Syrian, faces six child sexual exploitation charges and one count of sexual assault. He also faces two counts over the supply of cocaine and ecstasy.• Sina Omari, 20, who is Iranian, faces two counts of rape; five child sexual exploitation charges; two counts of making an indecent photo of a child; and two counts over the supply of cocaine and ecstasy.• Wadie Sharaf, 21, also Syrian, faces one count of rape; one count of attempted rape; three counts of sexual assault; and one count of sexual activity with a child.• Hussain Bashar, 19, British, faces one count of rape.• Mohammed Kurdi, 21, also British, faces two counts of rape; two child sexual exploitation charges; and two counts over the supply of ecstasy and cannabis.• Sardam Ahmed, 19, who is Iraqi, faces four counts of rape; one child sexual exploitation charge; one count of distributing an indecent photo of a child; and two counts over the supply of cocaine and ecstasy.• Ihab Al-Eisawi, 26, who is Egyptian, faces two counts of rape and one count of sexual assault.Six of the seven men named by police are listed as living in Bristol. The other, Sardam Ahmed, is of no-fixed abode.Officers said safeguarding measures and support have been made available to the victims.Superintendent Deepak Kenth said the case would be a “huge shock to our communities”, but they were working “tirelessly” to stop child sexual exploitation in the city. “We’ve held events in Bristol city centre and continue to work with hotels, taxi drivers, and other businesses, to raise awareness about the signs of exploitation and the need to report any concerns or issues to the police,” he said.","Alleged offences took place between 2022 and 2025 when the victims were in their mid to late teens.

Conservative commentator Bill Mitchell urged MAGA to not rant against President Donald Trump for softening his stance on H-1B as the reality is that if the H-1B program is ended tomorrow, the tech companies will not hire Americans because they are ""underskilled"".

People have to learn. You can’t take people off the unemployment line and say go make missiles,"" Trump said, triggering sharp reactions from MAGA influencers. They accused the president of implying that America does not have enough talented people, while the Democrats called it a typical Trump U-turn.""Never attack Trump for ANYTHING while he is president.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment

Military reforms: Asim Munir at the helm



Judicial restructuring: Federal constitutional court



Political reactions



What next







Pakistan’s National Assembly on Wednesday passed the 27th constitutional amendment bill, granting sweeping powers to the military in general and country’s army chief Asim Munir in specific, and restructuring the judiciary.The vote, held amid a ruckus in the lower house, saw 234 lawmakers in favour and only four against, speaker Ayaz Sadiq announced. The session was attended by top political leaders, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, PML-N President Nawaz Sharif, and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.The amendment comes at a time of heightened political tension in Pakistan, with the ruling coalition seeking to consolidate control over key defence and judicial institutions. The legislation follows earlier Senate approval, where it received 64 votes in favour and no opposition, as the opposition benches boycotted proceedings.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed the passage as a demonstration of national unity, saying the house exhibited solidarity. He also condemned a recent terrorist incident in Wana, drawing parallels to the Army Public School massacre, and praised law enforcement for securing the safety of students and cadets.The amendment elevates Pakistan army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir to the newly created role of Chief of Defence Forces, giving him constitutional authority over all three branches: army, navy, and air force. Honorary five-star ranks such as field marshal, marshal of the air force, and admiral of the fleet remain lifetime titles. According to the country's law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, the reform “aims to bring constitutional oversight to defence appointments while preserving military honour and tradition.The bill also establishes a federal constitutional court (FCC) to handle constitutional and provincial matters, leaving the Supreme Court to focus on civil and criminal cases. The FCC will have equal representation from all provinces and the power to take suo motu notices on constitutional petitions. The Judicial Commission will oversee judge transfers; refusal of a transfer will be treated as retirement.The ruling coalition, including PML-N, PPP, MQM-P, and allies, backed the amendment. Opposition lawmakers condemned it as unconstitutional. PTI chairman Gohar Ali Khan called it the “Baku Amendments” and accused the government of undermining democracy. Mehmood Khan Achakzai of PkMAP protested by tearing a copy of the bill in the house.The amendment now returns to the Senate for final approval before becoming law. Analysts say the 27th amendment significantly strengthens Munir’s role in Pakistan’s military hierarchy while altering judicial oversight, marking a shift in Pakistan’s institutional framework.(With input from agencies, Dawn)","The amendment elevates Pakistan army chief Asim Munir to the newly created role of Chief of Defence Forces.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment

Why it matters

The big picture

The Field Marshal’s expanding power evokes a hybrid of Pakistan’s two most dominant military rulers:

Ayub Khan, who introduced centralized presidential control and laid the foundations for military-led governance.

Zia-ul-Haq, who used the Army and Islamization to seize power, marginalize the judiciary, and suppress civilian opposition.

Munir is consolidating power not through martial law, but via constitutional amendments passed by a pliant parliament.

If Zia’s coup was loud and brutal against a strong popular leadership, Munir’s is silent, yet possibly more far reaching, being done through a political front office that’s pliant and dependent on the Army for authority. With Imran Khan in prison, any opposition will come from the streets and the troubled insurgencies to the west of Islamabad.

Pranab Dhal Samanta in the Economic Times

Zoom in

The transformation follows the India-Pakistan conflict in May 2025, a four-day exchange of air and missile strikes after the Pahalgam terror attack.

India’s Operation Sindoor targeted Pakistani airbases, radars, and command centers.

Pakistan requested a ceasefire after intense damage - a request reportedly initiated by Pakistan’s DGMO.

Donald Trump, who claimed to have brokered the truce(India has repeatedly denied the US President's claims), was effusively thanked by Munir and PM Shehbaz Sharif. Trump now calls Munir his “favorite field marshal.”

The Financial Times described their dynamic as a “bromance,” with Trump showcased on billboards across Pakistan alongside Munir and Sharif.

This international validation was followed by Munir’s promotion to Field Marshal, the second such promotion in Pakistan’s history - and the first codified under the Constitution.

Between the lines

This isn’t just about military command - it’s about rewriting the DNA of the Pakistani state.

The amendment creates a new Federal Constitutional Court, potentially diluting the powers of the Supreme Court and creating ambiguity about the hierarchy of judicial authority.

President Zardari is also granted lifelong immunity in the amendment, mirroring the legal shield given to Munir.

This dual protection signals a strategic alliance between the military and top civilian figures to institutionalize mutual insulation from accountability.

“Too much has been left to ad hoc and arbitrary decisions,” Mazari warned.

The domestic question: Can repression deliver reform?

The three-front storm: Taliban, TTP, and India

“If you nurture snakes in your backyard, they will bite you,” said Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the Pakistani military’s official spokesman, referencing the Taliban. What a comeuppance : The remark could just as well apply to all Pakistan-grown terror groups and the TTP, whose resurgence is a grim case of blowback.

The bottom line





In Pakistan, where generals have often ruled with impunity and influence, Field Marshal Asim Munir is scripting a new playbook-quiet, precise, and constitutionally sealed. His rise is not just another chapter in the country’s well-worn saga of military dominance. It is, as one senior opposition leader put it, “a rewrite of the entire power manual.”Pakistan’s controversial 27th Constitutional Amendment proposes to recast the country’s military command structure by abolishing the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) and creating the role of Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) - a position that will be held by the Army Chief, currently Field Marshal Asim Munir •The amendment vests unprecedented legal and constitutional power in the CDF, giving Munir operational and institutional control over the army, navy, and air force, as well as the country’s nuclear command.•It also grants five-star officers life-long rank, privileges, and immunity, a move seen as creating a parallel unelected authority beyond the reach of civilian or judicial oversight.“This amendment appears tailored to benefit a specific individual rather than to strengthen the defence structure,” Lt Gen Asif Yasin Malik, former defence secretary, told Dawn.The CJCSC post - created after the 1971 war to ensure coordination among services - will be dissolved on November 27, 2025, when the current chairman, Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza, retires.The 27th Amendment represents the largest shift in Pakistan’s civil-military balance since the Zia era, codifying the military’s supremacy in a way that future civilian governments may struggle to reverse.•The military will no longer merely influence governance from behind the scenes - it will be constitutionally entrenched at the center of executive authority.•Strategic nuclear assets, previously overseen by the National Command Authority, will now fall under the commander of national strategic command, appointed by the PM on the army chief’s advice, and selected from within the army.“All nuclear weapons and delivery systems will be under army control, including second-strike missiles traditionally under the Navy,” warned Dr Shireen Mazari, former human rights minister, a Dawn report said.•The change grants the army a monopoly over promotions, transfers, and postings across the services, threatening morale and inter-service harmony.“If promotions in the Air Force and Navy are determined by an army-origin CDF, it could lead to festering resentments,” Mazari cautioned.At home, Munir is both omnipresent and embattled. According to a Financial Times report, his supporters compare him to Mohammed bin Salman or South Korea’s General Park - ruthless modernisers willing to bulldoze institutions in the name of reform. His critics, however, see echoes of Zia-ul-Haq’s theocratic militarism cloaked in constitutional legitimacy.The judiciary is already split, thanks to a proposed constitutional court that would dilute the Supreme Court’s power. Journalists are censored, civil rights groups are muzzled, and political opponents - most notably former Prime Minister Imran Khan - are jailed or silenced.And yet, Munir has cast himself as the architect of reform. In his speech at the Pakistan Military Academy, he spoke of “treasures hidden beneath our land” and claimed that Pakistan had begun to “regain its rightful place in the comity of nations.”But the economy tells another story. As per the FT report, Pakistan’s investment rate is the lowest in South Asia, its poverty rate has risen to 25%, and its youth unemployment is dangerously high. The country remains dependent on IMF bailouts and Gulf financing that has yet to materialise in promised volumes.While Munir consolidates power at home, Pakistan finds itself encircled by a resurgent triangle of threats - each historically rooted, each dangerously revived. In the west, the Afghan Taliban’s return to power in 2021 has proved more liability than leverage. Once covertly supported by Pakistan’s security establishment, the Taliban now resist Islamabad’s demands and turn a blind eye to cross-border attacks on Pakistani soil.More ominously, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an offshoot long declared outlawed, has regrouped in Afghanistan and resumed attacks in Pakistan’s tribal belt and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. This year alone, militant violence has killed over 1,400 people - the highest toll in a decade.“The military simply lacks political support on the ground there,” Iftikhar Firdous, founder of The Khorasan Diary, told FT. “The crackdown has alienated entire communities.”Simultaneously, Pakistan’s eastern border with India remains fragile after the four-day air conflict in May.Add to that domestic insurgencies in Balochistan and the Pashtun belt, and Pakistan now faces not one, but three overlapping security fronts. Instead of acting as a force-multiplier, the military’s expanding political and economic footprint is beginning to stretch its operational capacity thin.The 27th Amendment enshrines military supremacy in Pakistan's Constitution under the guise of reform and modernization.•It moves the country further away from parliamentary democracy, and deeper into military-led constitutional authoritarianism.•As Field Marshal Asim Munir prepares to become the first Chief of Defence Forces, Pakistan’s most consequential question remains: Can a military man fix a failing nation - or will history repeat itself?(With inputs from agencies)","Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment.

ISLAMABAD: A suicide bomber killed 12 people outside a court in Islamabad on Tuesday in a sharp escalation of militant violence that the defence minister said had pushed the country into a ""state of war"".Pakistani govt ministers accused neighbouring Afghanistan of complicity in the bloodshed - an accusation Kabul denied - and vowed retaliation if Afghan authorities failed to rein in the militants Islamabad says were responsible. ""We are in a state of war,"" said defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif after the attack, the first strike on civilians in Islamabad in a decade. ""Bringing this war to Islamabad is a message from Kabul, to which Pakistan has the full power to respond. ""The bombing outside an Islamabad court also wounded 27 people interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said. The court bomber blew himself up near the entrance at around lunchtime. Images on local media showed people covered in blood lying next to a police van. A vehicle was seen on fire and another car was badly damaged. Police cordoned off the site. Naqvi said the bomber had tried to enter the court building on foot but, unable to find a way in, detonated the device outside, close to a police vehicle.Several of the wounded were in critical condition, a hospital source said.No group claimed responsibility for Tuesday's attack. The main Pakistani militant group, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), denied involvement in the attacks. But a group affiliated with the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, according to The Khorasan Diary, a digital platform in Islamabad that monitors militant activity in the region.TTP militants have in recent years focused attacks on security forces. Civilians had not been hit in Islamabad for a decade, according to Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, a group that tracks attacks.Islamabad says that the Pakistani Taliban and other militants are based in Afghanistan, with the support of India. ""We are totally clear that Afghanistan has to stop them. In case of a failure, we have no option but to take care of those terrorists who are attacking our country,"" Naqvi said, speaking at the scene of the court bombing. The Taliban administration spokesperson in Kabul did not respond to a request for comment on Pakistan's accusations.The court attack happened hours after militants stormed a school near the Afghan border on Monday. The attack on the school in Wana, in the north west, began Monday, when a suicide vehicle rammed the main entrance, killing three people, Naqvi said. Militants then entered the school, which is run by the military but educates civilians.By Tuesday evening, three militants were still inside the compound, security officials said, with rescue operations under way for the students trapped in another part of the school. Naqvi said that the school assailants were in contact with their handlers in Afghanistan during the attack.Reuters","A suicide bomber killed 12 people outside a court in Islamabad on Tuesday in a sharp escalation of militant violence.

Deadlock Deepens: Afghanistan Calls Pakistan Irresponsible As Peace Talks Break Down Once Again





ISLAMABAD: Pakistan said on Sunday that it was committed to dialogue to resolve differences with the Afghan Taliban but demanded that Kabul must address concerns regarding the use of its territory by terrorists.Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Tahir Andrabi issued a statement on different media queries regarding the third round of talks with the Afghan Taliban regime in Istanbul on November 6, which concluded a day later. Turkiye and Qatar mediated the parleys.The peace talks ended without any agreement to tackle the thorny issues of cross-border terrorism , the top officials had said on Saturday.""Pakistan remains committed to the resolution of bilateral differences through dialogue. However, Pakistan's core concern, i.e. terrorism emanating from Afghanistan, needs to be addressed first and foremost,"" the FO said in a statement.It also said that Pakistan's Armed Forces and its people were well determined to eliminate the menace of terrorism from its soil and take action against its supporters, abettors and financiers.In the long statement, the spokesperson said that for the past four years, since the Taliban regime came to power in Afghanistan, there has been a sharp surge in terrorist attacks emanating from Afghan soil.""Throughout these years, Pakistan, despite suffering military and civilian casualties, exercised maximum restraint and did not retaliate,"" it said.Pakistan's expectation was that the Taliban regime would be able to control these attacks and take concrete actions against the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan/Fitna al Khawarij (TTP/FaK) elements present on Afghan soil, the FO said.The Pakistan government last year notified the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as ""Fitna al-Khawarij"", a reference to a group in earlier Islamic history which was involved in violence.Pakistan also tried to positively engage with Afghanistan by offering bilateral trade concessions and humanitarian assistance, and the intention to constructively engage with Afghanistan so as to enable it to become a stable, peaceful and prosperous country that is at peace within and with its neighbours, the statement said.However, despite all these positive gestures, ""the response from the Taliban regime has only been hollow promises and inaction,"" it added.Instead of acting upon the core expectation to stop Afghan territory from being used for attacks against Pakistan, the Taliban regime has always tried to shy away from taking concrete and verifiable actions, it said.""Instead, it has tried to confuse the main issue with other relatively irrelevant and hypothetical issues. By confusing the main issue of terrorism, it keeps trying to develop a narrative which absolves the Taliban regime of its commitments and responsibilities towards the international community and its own people,"" it added.The statement said that Pakistan's October 2025 response to the consistent attacks emanating from Afghanistan was a manifestation of the will and determination that it will not leave any stone unturned to safeguard its territory and its people.The statement added that the Taliban regime was only interested in prolonging the temporary ceasefire, but without taking concrete and verifiable actions against the TTP/FaK terrorists.Pakistan also accused the Afghan Taliban of using the issue of Pakistani terrorists hiding in Afghanistan as a humanitarian issue, adding that they had fled in 2015 to avoid a military operation and fought together with the Afghan Taliban against Nato troops.""These terrorists and their families are now being harboured by the Taliban regime as a payback for their allegiance to the Afghan Taliban,"" it said, and added that the same terrorists established training camps in Afghanistan to launch terrorist activities in Pakistan.The FO rejected the Kabul excuse of lack of control over TTP and demanded definite and concrete actions. Pakistan also rejected the portrayal of TTP as refugees and asked Kabul to hand them over to Pakistan.It said Pakistan has never eschewed dialogue with any Government in Kabul, but it would not hold dialogue with any terrorist group.",Pakistan says it is committed to dialogue to resolve differences with the Afghan Taliban.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment

What does it mean?



Opposition backlash and protests



Divided legal opinions



Support for reforms







Pakistan’s government has introduced a major constitutional change that has sparked widespread debate and protests across the country. The proposed 27th constitutional amendment, which will be voted on in Parliament next week, seeks to restructure the military’s chain of command and overhaul the judiciary, prompting strong criticism from the Opposition.The current move mirrors the era of General Zia-ul-Haq, Pakistan’s longest-serving de facto head of state, who introduced sweeping constitutional changes to entrench military control under a civilian façade. The proposed 27th Amendment, risks reviving that legacy by placing the armed forces once again at the centre of Pakistan’s political structure.The bill, tabled in the Senate on Saturday after cabinet approval, proposes to abolish the post of chairman joint chiefs of staff committee (CJCSC) and replace it with a new and more powerful position -- chief of defence forces (CDF).According to reports in Dawn, the post will be held by the serving chief of army staff, who will also become the constitutional head of the army, navy and air force. This change would make General Asim Munir the most powerful military officer in Pakistan’s history, formalising his recent promotion to Field Marshal.The amendment also includes plans to set up a new federal constitutional court (FCC) and change how high court judges are appointed.It seeks to transfer some powers from the Supreme Court to the new court, while also granting the president lifelong immunity from criminal prosecution.Pakistan law minister Azam Nazir Tarar presented the bill in the senate, where chairman Yusuf Raza Gilani referred it to a committee led by Farooq Naek for review. Naek said the goal was to “create consensus among members” before the bill comes up for voting on Monday. The government is confident of securing a two-thirds majority in both the senate and the national assembly.Opposition parties have strongly opposed the amendment, calling it a direct threat to Pakistan’s Constitution. A coalition of opposition groups, the Tehreek-e-Tahafuz Ayeen-e-Pakistan (TTAP), which includes Imran Khan’s PTI, Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen (MWM), Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) and the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) has announced nationwide protests starting Sunday.“Democratic institutions have been paralysed within Pakistan… the nation must step up against the [proposed] 27th Amendment,” MWM chief Allama Raja Nasir Abbas said.PkMAP leader Mahmood Khan Achakzai said the protests would begin with the slogan: “Long live democracy, down with dictatorship.” He warned, “The opposition alliance had no choice but to launch a protest movement following the government’s move, which is shaking the foundations of the Constitution.”Legal experts are split on the amendment’s impact. Critics say it would reduce the powers of the Supreme Court, making it “irrelevant,” and tighten executive control over the judiciary.One senior counsel told Dawn, “Left with a limited jurisdiction of deciding ordinary civil, criminal and statutory appeals, the Supreme Court has now become all the more a ‘Supreme District Court’.”Former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar warned that the changes would “empower [the new] Federal Constitutional Court by disempowering the Supreme Court.” He said the amendment also gives the Chief of the Defence Forces constitutional authority for life, formally recognising the Field Marshal rank.Another lawyer pointed out that under the new Article 175A, the chief justice of the FCC would outrank the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and serve until the age of 68 -- three years longer than the current limit of 65.Some legal experts, however, have welcomed the changes. Senior counsel Hafiz Ahsaan Ahmad Khokhar called the 27th Amendment “a major and long-awaited structural shift” in Pakistan’s justice system.He said the plan to have two separate apex courts -- one for appeals (Supreme Court) and one for constitutional cases (FCC) -- would bring “greater clarity, efficiency and constitutional coherence.”He also argued that the reforms could reduce political influence in the judiciary, cut down case backlogs, and modernise the justice system.Khokhar added that the new defence structure under Article 243 was in line with “modern constitutional democracies,” ensuring that the armed forces would operate under a single advisory framework accountable to the prime minister, defence minister and National Security Committee.Newly elected Supreme Court Bar Association in Pakistan, President Haroonur Rasheed also supported the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court, saying it could help streamline the judicial process.","Proposed 27th constitutional amendment will be voted on in Parliament next week.

Pakistan Railways has halted all operations of the Jaffar Express between Quetta and Peshawar for four days beginning Sunday, citing “serious security concerns” in Balochistan, news agency PTI reported.The temporary suspension — enforced from 9 to 12 November — follows multiple insurgent attacks on the train over the past year, including a dramatic hijacking in March that left 26 people dead.Railway officials said the move came after fresh intelligence warnings of possible attacks targeting tracks, railway assets and civilian passengers. “The precautionary measure is based on advice from security and intelligence agencies to ensure the safety of passengers, railway staff, civilians and critical rail assets,” a senior official said, as quoted by PTI.The Jaffar Express is one of Pakistan’s busiest long-distance routes, carrying thousands of passengers daily at a cost far lower than road travel. Local commuters have criticised the shutdown, saying it leaves people in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with few affordable transport options.Over the past 12 months, the Jaffar Express has become a repeated target for insurgent groups, particularly the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA).In March, BLA militants hijacked the train with 380 passengers on board, triggering a two-day standoff in a mountainous tunnel. Twenty-six people were killed before security forces rescued more than 350 passengers. Authorities said 33 militants also died in the rescue operation.Security officials say insurgent groups are increasingly targeting railways to cripple movement and signal the state’s inability to secure critical transport arteries. Analysts note that the frequency of attacks shows “a collapse of basic security control” across parts of Balochistan’s rail corridor.Political leaders in the province argue that Islamabad has ignored decades of local grievances. Balochistan National Party chief Akhtar Mengal recently warned that the state has “lost control” of the region, saying: “There is not a single inch of Balochistan left where the government can claim authority.”The suspension comes as Pakistan faces one of its most dangerous security challenges in years. Not only has the BLA intensified operations across Balochistan, but attacks linked to Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Islamic State Khorasan (ISK) and cross-border militants have surged.According to the latest Global Terrorism Index, Pakistan recorded a 45% jump in terrorism-related deaths this year. Security officials warn the country is now battling “four fronts at once”—an insurgent network straddling provincial, sectarian and cross-border lines.Diplomatic efforts have yielded little. Peace talks this week between Pakistan and Afghanistan in Istanbul collapsed without agreement, with both sides blaming each other for breakdowns in the ceasefire. Pakistan accuses Kabul of sheltering TTP fighters; the Taliban dismisses the allegations.","Pakistan Railways has halted all operations of the Jaffar Express between Quetta and Peshawar for four days beginning Sunday.

Pakistan’s government has moved ahead with one of the most sweeping structural changes to the country’s constitutional and military setup in decades. The proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment, tabled in the Senate on Saturday after approval by the federal cabinet, rewrites the chain of command of the armed forces and places Field Marshall Asim Munir higher than any military officer before him.The bill restructures Article 243 of the Constitution and creates a powerful new post: Chief of Defence Forces (CDF). According to Dawn, the position will be held by the serving Chief of Army Staff, who will simultaneously become the constitutionally recognised head of Pakistan’s Army, Navy and Air Force. The development formalises General Munir’s elevation as Pakistan’s Field Marshal — a title that the government has already awarded but is now seeking to permanently embed into the Constitution.The changes have ignited intense debate in Islamabad, dividing political parties, lawyers and civil society. Supporters argue that the bill modernises command structures, while critics see it as a dramatic centralisation of military power that weakens civilian oversight.As per report from Dawn, the bill abolishes the position of Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), the top coordinating office among Pakistan’s military services, from 27 November, when the tenure of the current CJCSC General Sahir Shamshad Mirza ends.Law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar told Parliament that no new appointment will be made, because the Army Chief will take over the role’s functions as Chief of Defence Forces.Under the amendment, the President will appoint the Army, Naval and Air Chiefs on the Prime Minister’s advice, while the CDF will be constitutionally empowered to command all three services.A new position Commander of the National Strategic Command will oversee Pakistan’s nuclear and strategic arsenal. Dawn reported that the commander must be an officer from the Army, appointed by the Prime Minister on the recommendation of the CDF. This further cements the Army Chief’s control over nuclear command authority.The bill also grants unprecedented rights to officers who attain five-star ranks such as Field Marshal, Marshal of the Air Force, or Admiral of the Fleet.Law minister Tarar clarified that Parliament not the Pakistan Prime Minister will have the power to cancel such titles.The amendment does not stop at the military. The second half of the proposal restructures Pakistan’s judicial system.According to Geo News, the bill establishes a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC): a powerful new judicial body that would:Legal experts quoted by Dawn warned that the changes could “dethrone” the Supreme Court as Pakistan’s top judicial authority. One senior counsel said the Supreme Court risked being turned into a “Supreme District Court”, dealing mostly with ordinary appeals, while constitutional matters shift to the FCC.Former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar argued that the amendment tightens executive control over the judiciary and “empowers the FCC by disempowering the Supreme Court”.However, other senior lawyers called it a “forward-looking reform”. They say separating constitutional and appellate functions would reduce delays, depoliticise the Supreme Court and bring Pakistan closer to judicial models in other democracies.The bill has triggered fierce debate in Islamabad. The timing — months after Munir’s elevation and amid delicate coalition negotiations — has intensified public scrutiny.Dawn reported that the proposal surfaced after PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari revealed that PML-N leaders, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, requested PPP support for constitutional reforms.Government allies insist the reform merely formalises existing military structures and honours national heroes. Critics say it permanently rebalances power in favour of the Army.If adopted, the 27th Constitutional Amendment will be one of Pakistan’s most consequential defence reforms since the 1980s, dissolving one of the military’s oldest offices, raising the Army Chief to unprecedented constitutional supremacy, and reshaping Pakistan’s highest courts.","Pakistan's government has moved ahead with one of the most sweeping structural changes to the country’s constitutional and military setup in decades.

Deadlock Deepens: Afghanistan Calls Pakistan Irresponsible As Peace Talks Break Down Once Again

(With ANI inputs)





NEW DELHI: A day after peace talks between Afghanistan and Pakistan in Turkey broke down, the Taliban on Saturday accused “elements within the Pakistani military” of pursuing “anti-Afghanistan policies for years. ”“Unfortunately, certain military elements in Pakistan appear to view a stable and strong Afghanistan as contrary to their interests,” Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement on X. “They have long exploited Afghanistan’s instability, conflicts, and displacement, and now seem intent on creating tensions through fabricated pretexts.”Mujahid also rejected claims that the rise of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) was linked to the Taliban’s return to power in Kabul. “Some groups have falsely accused the Islamic Emirate, suggesting that instability in Pakistan and the TTP’s growth began with our arrival. In reality, both date back to 2002, a result of misguided policies by certain Pakistani military elements who aligned with the US, permitted drone strikes in Waziristan, and turned against their own people,” he wrote.He pointed to a series of Pakistani military campaigns against the TTP — including Operations Al-Mizan, Rah-e-Rast, Sher Dil, Nijat, Koh-e-Safid, and Zarb-e-Azb — that, he said, displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians.“In this so-called war on terror, 80,000–90,000 soldiers and civilians were killed, by Islamabad’s own count, long before the Islamic Emirate’s rise,” Mujahid added.Calling Pakistan’s instability “an internal issue,” Mujahid remarked the Taliban has taken steps to prevent cross-border militancy since taking power. These include mediating dialogue among political and religious figures, relocating refugees from the Durand Line, banning weapons among refugee populations, and issuing fatwas against unauthorized foreign jihad.“The Islamic Emirate welcomes all efforts that allow refugees to return safely,” he stated, reaffirming that Afghanistan would not allow its territory to be used to interfere in another country’s affairs.","The Taliban accused “elements within the Pakistani military’ of pursuing “anti- Afghanistan policies for years” “They have long exploited Afghanistan’s instability, conflicts, and displacement, and now seem intent on creating tensions through fabricated pretexts,” Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125186693,imgsize-78016,width-400,resizemode-4/taliban-accuses-pakistani-military-of-fueling-instability-through-quotmanufactured-pretextsquot.jpg"
‘Knew F-16s could deliver nukes’: Ex-CIA officer makes major claim on Pakistan; recalls warning of ‘enemy within’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/knew-f-16s-could-deliver-nukes-ex-cia-officer-makes-major-claim-on-pakistan-recalls-warning-of-enemy-within/articleshow/125181155.cms,"Representative image

CIA Whistleblower Confirms Pakistan’s F-16s Were Nuke-Capable, But US Hid The Truth From The World

‘Benazir was cut out of the loop’

A cover-up?





In a startling revelation, former CIA counterproliferation officer Richard Barlow has claimed that successive US Presidents continued to certify Pakistan as a non-nuclear state until 1989 — even though Washington’s own intelligence showed that US-supplied F-16 fighter jets had been modified to deliver nuclear weapons.Barlow, who tracked Pakistan’s clandestine nuclear program through the 1980s, said US officials were fully aware of Islamabad’s nuclear capabilities. “We knew that the F-16s were capable of delivering the Pakistani nuclear weapons as they existed at that time, without any doubt. It’s a hard engineering question, period. It had been looked at by the engineers and the physicists, not by me. There was that. Yet the government went ahead with the sale,” Barlow said in an interview with ANI.He added that the Reagan and Bush administrations kept certifying that Pakistan did not possess nuclear weapons “all the way through 1989,” even as CIA assessments contradicted those claims. “The President continued to certify that Pakistan did not possess nuclear weapons all the way through 1989. Now, I mean, I can tell you that most of us in the CIA are not comfortable with that, to say the least. But we’re not elected officials,” Barlow said.“All we can do is provide the elected officials and senior policymakers with the best available intelligence information, which is accurate, and brief them accordingly. What they do after that is not our place; we’re not in control of that.”Barlow said the US intelligence community had long concluded that Pakistan’s F-16 fleet could deliver nuclear weapons, a finding later echoed in journalist Seymour Hersh’s 1993 article in The New Yorker. “You can read all about it in Seymour Hersh’s article in The New Yorker in 1993. They saw the intelligence community saw nuclear weapons moving to air bases and being put on F-16s, et cetera. You know, so the nuclear weapons that Pakistan did not possess, according to the President of the United States, were actually being stuck on,” Barlow said.The revelations trace back to the 1987 “Brass Tacks” crisis, when Pakistani scientist Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan openly hinted at a nuclear deterrent amid heightened tensions with India. Barlow noted that the US technical experts had already verified Pakistan’s nuclear capability at that time.“To put it in a nutshell, there had been studies for years inside the intelligence community by experts, like national laboratories, etc. We knew all about the Pakistani nuclear weapons design, and we knew all about the F-16s, as you could imagine,” he said.According to Barlow, then Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto had limited control over Pakistan’s nuclear program, which was effectively managed by General Mirza Aslam Beg and President Ghulam Ishaq Khan. The US, he said, only confronted Islamabad over the issue after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989.The US had kept the matter quiet during the Afghan war to secure Pakistan’s cooperation against the Soviet Union — a Cold War priority that overshadowed nuclear proliferation concerns.Additionally, talking about past India-Pakistan tensions, Barlow said that by 1990, tensions between India and Pakistan over the nuclear issue had reached alarming levels. The crisis was ultimately defused after then Defense Secretary Robert Gates was sent to New Delhi and Islamabad by President George HW Bush.He added that the 1990 standoff was “far more dangerous” than more recent India-Pakistan flare-ups due to poor command structures and limited communication. “There was a significantly greater chance of miscalculation in 1990 and miscommunication, among other issues. So I think that was a far more dangerous period,” he said.Barlow also discussed the Pressler Amendment, a 1985 US law requiring the President to certify annually that Pakistan did not possess a nuclear device to receive military aid.“After the 1990 nuclear crisis, my bosses at the agency refused to go along with any more certifications. Believe it or not, there were still people in the US government who wanted to certify under the Pressler Amendment,” he said. “They were having a collective heart attack because they knew it was over — the aid, et cetera.”Barlow also claimed that senior US State Department officials secretly tipped off Islamabad about an undercover American operation in the 1980s to arrest a retired Pakistani general involved in nuclear smuggling. The joint CIA–Customs sting had targeted Pakistani agent Arshad Parvez, who was attempting to purchase 25 metric tons of Maraging 350 steel — a key material for uranium enrichment — under the direction of Brigadier General Inam-ul-Haq. “He was supposed to show up in Pennsylvania... but Haq didn’t show up. And I learned that some people in the State Department had tipped off the Pakistani government to this arrest warrantBarlow said he was furious upon learning that officials within his own government had sabotaged the operation, describing his reaction as “ballistic.” The revelation, he said, pointed to how elements within Washington prioritized Pakistan’s cooperation in the Afghan war over enforcing non-proliferation laws. “These were people in my own government, the enemy within,” Barlow remarked, adding that such internal compromises weakened US efforts to curb Pakistan’s nuclear build-up during the 1980s.",Former CIA counterproliferation officer Richard Barlow has claimed that successive US Presidents continued to certify Pakistan as a non-nuclear state until 1989.
