West Bengal professor weds student in classroom

Video circulated to malign my image: Accused prof

KOLKATA/HARINGHATA (NADIA): A video clip of a professor of a Bengal govt-funded university, apparently marrying a first-year student in a classroom earlier this month, has gone viral, raising questions of propriety and prompting the institute to order an inquiry and send the teacher on leave.Payal Banerjee , a former head of applied psychology at Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology (Makaut) in Nadia's Haringhata, has said in her defence that she and the student were merely acting out a ""wedding drama"" during a freshers' welcome event. She has threatened to sue a ""jealous colleague"" for releasing the clip without context in order to defame her.TOI is not naming the student.The clip shows Banerjee in bridal finery and the student - in a green sweatshirt - enacting wedding rituals. Teachers, other staff and students cheer the couple and take selfies. The ""wedding"" also had an e-invite, which listed a haldi ceremony on Jan 9 and a mehndi and sangeet ceremony on Jan 14.Interim vice-chancellor Tapas Chakrabarty said an inquiry panel, comprising five faculty members, had been set up. But he said it was ""surprising that a video of a Jan 16 event has flooded social media on Jan 28, twelve days later.""Payal Banerjee, a former head of applied psychology at Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology (Makaut), told TOI that the intention of releasing the clip now was ""to malign my image."" ""I even identified the person who did it, and I am taking help to take legal steps against the person,"" she said.The first-year student, who joined classes in Aug last year, did not respond to calls.Banerjee also claimed that the e-invite had been made by students, and that she had no role in it.She said her students had planned a cultural programme for the freshers' welcome, in which the ""wedding"" was part of a skit. ""They (the students) requested me to play the main character, and I agreed. Other faculty members knew about it and agreed to the programme; no one objected then. Students printed the card and planned the whole thing. My first-year students and I acted, following the script. This was nothing serious. I agreed only because the students requested me,"" she added.Several students defended Banerjee, saying this was also ""psychodrama"" - a therapeutic technique that uses role-playing to help people gain insight into their lives, an established psychology technique.But several senior academics expressed surprise at how Banerjee - who has been teaching applied psychology for 13 years - felt the need to enact a wedding publicly with a first-year student, especially someone who has not yet attained legal marriageable age. ""We have never felt the need for such wedding enactments in classrooms, with first-semester examinations scheduled from Jan 30. And why should Banerjee encourage such requests in the first place,"" wondered a senior professor.",West Bengal professor Payal Banerjee is under investigation after a video of her staging a mock wedding with a first-year student went viral.

BENGALURU: A 24-year-old college student who boarded a cab went through a terrifying ordeal after two men forced their way into the vehicle and attempted to rape her in east Bengaluru in the wee hours of Monday.The miscreants escaped only after locals came to her aid.According to the complaint filed by the girl, a resident of Kammanahalli and an undergraduate student of a private college, the incident happened between 2am and 3am.The girl, who is from a northeastern state, wanted to bring a friend from Whitefield to her house. She booked a cab from an aggregator around 2am.After the vehicle arrived, she walked out of her house, and as soon as she got into the car and closed the door, two strangers tried to sneak into the rear seat where she was sitting.The shocked girl immediately objected to the duo getting into the car. The driver also did not know the two and got into an argument with them.Sensing danger, the girl got down from the car and started running towards her house. One of the strangers ran behind her and caught her by the neck from behind.When she tried to get away from his clutches, he hit her and pushed her to the ground. He tried to strip her, she said in the complaint.The attacker touched her inappropriately and sexually harassed her, while the driver got busy fighting the other intruder. The girl's cries drew residents nearby, who rushed to her help. The duo, however, ran away from the spot.The girl called helpline 112 and a Hoysala patrol vehicle rushed to the spot and attended to her complaint. As she had an exam in the morning, she approached police after writing the test.Acting on her complaint, cops registered a case under BNS Sections 74 (assault or use of criminal force to a woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 75 (sexual harassment).According to the girl, the strangers were in their late 20s or 30s. ""The area doesn't have CCTV cameras, so we are checking footage from surrounding places,"" a police officer said.A 26-year-old software company employee from Nagaland, who was returning home along with her colleagues in an office cab, was stripped by a machete-carrying youth around 3.30am in Aug 2023 near Lingarajpuram.The youth stopped the car and sexually harassed the woman.When she started running, he stripped her, and she entered a house to save herself from the attacker.

Chinmoy was found at Lost and Found Centre 21, one of many set up by the administration.

Jitendra Sahu roamed the vast grounds, eyes scanning the crowd for any trace of his aunt Shakuntala Devi.A woman of 70, she had travelled from Gwalior with a group. ""She has an identity card around her neck,"" Jitendra said, as if saying it aloud would summon her back. ""Her phone is unreachable.

No fresh case was reported, while 20 patients remain on ventilator support across different hospitals.NIV's next step will be to study the C.jejuni found in patients to determine if they were struck by a more serious strain. Officials said genetically characterising the entire bacterial genome of C. jejuni would likely provide insights into virulence.Dr Shahzad Beg Mirza, microbiologist at Dr DY Patil Medical College, told TOI that NIV analyses could reveal if a specific strain was responsible for triggering multiple GBS cases.""Some C. jejuni strains with particular genetic traits are strongly linked to GBS. The key mechanism behind GBS involves 'molecular mimicry'. Similarities between bacterial components and human nerve structures can lead the immune response to mistakenly attack the nervous system,"" he said.""Changes in a bacterial component called LOS (lipooligosaccharide) may be a factor in the outbreak's severity. The genetic study will help determine if the strain involved in this surge carries these high-risk genetic traits, which could explain the increased number of GBS cases.""","Water samples tested for Campylobacter jejuni, found in stool samples of at least five patients, were found free of the bacterium.

Tom Homan , US President Donald Trump’s “border czar” and former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), expressed frustration over the challenges ICE agents face in sanctuary cities due to immigrants being ""well-educated"" about their rights.Speaking on American news network CNN, Homan complained that initiatives like Chicago's ""Know Your Rights"" campaign hinder ICE's ability to arrest undocumented immigrants .“For instance, Chicago—very well-educated,“ Homan continued. ”They‘ve been educated on how to how to defy ICE, how to hide from ICE. I‘ve seen many pamphlets from many NGOs: ’Here‘s how you escape ICE from arresting you. Here‘s what you need to do.’""“They call it ‘Know Your Rights.’ I call it ‘how to escape arrest,’” Homan added.Despite these challenges, Homan remained resolute. ""If we gotta play that cat and mouse game, that’s what we’re going to do ‘til every one of them’s gone,” he said.Under Trump's renewed immigration policies, ICE operations have ramped up in major cities, including Chicago, Miami, and Newark. According to NBC News, ICE has arrested over 4,800 individuals since Trump returned to office, with the administration promising even more aggressive measures in the coming weeks.Concerns have been raised about ICE's activities in sensitive locations such as schools, with Homan justifying such operations by citing public safety and national security threats. Critics argue that targeting educational institutions spreads fear among students and undermines trust in local communities.In an appearance on Megyn Kelly ’s YouTube show, Homan entertained the idea of offering financial incentives for immigrants to ""self-deport."" Kelly suggested providing a financial payout to encourage voluntary departures, a proposal Homan said was under consideration but did not elaborate on.The heightened deportation measures have sparked outrage, with celebrities like Selena Gomez publicly condemning the administration’s actions. Gomez, whose family has Mexican roots, posted an emotional message on Instagram, expressing sorrow for the affected families.Though the posts were later deleted, her words highlighted the human cost of the intensified ICE operations.Homan dismissed criticisms, including from public figures, stating on Fox News: “If they don’t like it, they should go to Congress and change the law. We’re going to do this operation without apology.”","Tom Homan, former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), expressed frustration over the challenges ICE agents face in sanctuary cities.

Trump approval rating slips in first week; majority back his actions on immigration,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-approval-rating-slips-in-first-week-majority-back-his-actions-on-immigration/articleshow/117746927.cms,"Majority supports Trump's stance on immigration



After the first week fueled with numerous executive orders, US President Donald Trump's approval rating stood at 49 per cent in the first Emerson College Polling survey of his second spell in the Oval office.According to the polling results, Trump's approval rating almost matched the level of support he received in the presidential election concluded in 2024. Meanwhile, 41 per cent disapproved of Trump, while 10 per cent remained neutral.Notably, this was the lowest disapproval rating the polling agency has recorded in its national polls since the start of Trump's first term.According to the executive director of Emerson College Polling, Spencer Kimball, Trump's ratings were safe in all the age groups except for those 70 and older, which shows him with a disapproval rating of 49 percent and an approval rating of 48 percent.Pollsters found a significant increase in the percentage of those who say the country is heading in the right direction, with 52 percent saying so, compared to 48 percent who say it’s on the wrong track. A poll from earlier this month found two-thirds said it was heading in the wrong direction.Kimball said the change is driven by a flip in Republican views of the country’s direction and fewer independents who say the country’s going in the wrong direction. A slight majority of independents still say it’s on the wrong track, but that’s a drop from the nearly 70 percent who said so earlier this month.Another survey conducted by Reuters and Ispos, however, showed a decline in US President's approval ratings and said that 45 per cent of participants approved of Trump’s actions, which included 45 per cent of participants approving of Trump’s actions.According to Reuters, the number marked a 2-point decrease from a poll conducted earlier this month.Trump’s disapproval rating shot up by 7 percentage points, from 39 per cent to 46 per cent of survey takers who were displeased with his new measures as commander in chief.“While it does seem Trump is getting a honeymoon to some extent, his numbers are still not impressive by historical standards,” Kyle Kondik, an analyst with the University of Virginia Center for Politics, told Reuters.The Trump administration's actions on immigration have drawn a stark divide between the supporters and critics. Around 48 percent of Americans approve of Trump’s approach to immigration and border security , compared to 41 percent who disapprove, Emerson College data said.Meanwhile, a slight majority of 54 percent supported changing the definition of birthright citizenship in a Reuters/Ispos survey. 37 percent are opposed and about 20 percent are neutral.Just less than 60 percent of respondents also voiced their dissatisfaction with the president’s efforts to end diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) hiring practices within federal offices across the nation. His order to close federal DEI offices was opposed by 51 percent, while 44 percent were in favor of the decision, the poll found, Reuters/Ispos survey said.","According to the polling results, Trump's approval rating almost matched the level of support he received in the presidential election concluded in 2024.

A promising future broken by a risky tradition

A celebratory event for a Philadelphia Eagles fan turned into a catastrophic one. 18-year-old Tyler Sabapathy , like every enthusiastic Eagles fan, was present at 15th and Market Street, Center City, on Sunday to celebrate the Philadelphia Eagles' 55-23 win over the Washington Commanders and entry into the Super Bowl LI against the Kansas City Chiefs.Being an accomplished gymnast with over 120 medals, Tyler climbed up a pole to celebrate with more vigor, enthusiasm, and craze. Little did he know his celebration would cost him a heavy blunder.There were two more people with Tyler on the pole. Witnesses from the ground who captured the viral video of Tyler Sabapathy falling from the pole say, 'Tyler lost his grip and balance, fell backward from the pole, and hit his head on the concrete sidewalk.'Witnesses said police quickly came to his aid and took him to a hospital. Students of Temple University said Tyler sustained critical injuries to the brain over the weekend, and he succumbed to death Tuesday afternoon.The letter read:""The loss of a promising 18-year-old man like Tyler is both tragic and traumatic. There are no words that can make sense of it, and the entire Temple community mourns his passing. Our hearts go out to Tyler's family, friends, classmates and all who knew and loved him.A native of Toronto, Canada, Tyler was already a thriving student within Temple University's College of Public Health, where he was majoring in exercise and sport science. As an accomplished gymnast with more than 120 medals in provincial, regional and international competitions, Tyler was fascinated with injury prevention, and this ultimately led him to pursue the major that he did. He no doubt had a bright future ahead of him, and it is so tragic that we will not be able to see how he would have made his mark on the world.""The risky tradition of climbing poles to celebrate a football team's win cost a young man's life. A young man who could have been a promising future for the NCAA Men's Gymnastics championship.The police have constantly warned Eagles fans not to climb up the poles, but nobody listens. Some personnel even used a deterrent to prevent fans from climbing up the traffic lights and poles. But to no avail! Even a gymnast's life is not guaranteed if he climbs up the pole. Such a risky tradition is unsafe and illegal and should not be followed.Also Read : Eagles vs Commanders: 55 - 23!

A man of Iraqi origin, who stirred outrage across the globe in 2023 by burning copies of the Quran, was shot dead inside his house on late Wednesday in Sweden, authorities confirmed.Swedish media identified the victim as Salwan Momika , an Iraqi activist and refugee who, alongside fellow protester Salwan Najem, had been facing hate crime charges .""A man was found shot in a home in Hovsjo in Sodertalje late on Wednesday. It is 38-year-old Salwan Momika, who has died from gunshot wounds,"" Swedish state media stated.The Stockholm district court was scheduled to deliver its verdict on Thursday morning, just hours after the fatal shooting on Wednesday night.According to Sweden-based The Local, the attack took place at around 11pm, with reports suggesting Momika was live-streaming at the time. Police have detained five individuals in connection with the killing but have not confirmed the victim’s identity or details of his injuries. The court, however, postponed its ruling, citing the defendant’s death.Momika and Najem’s protests in 2023, which involved setting fire to the Quran in Sweden and making inflammatory gestures, triggered widespread condemnation, particularly from Muslim-majority nations.The outrage led to violent demonstrations, including an attack on the Swedish embassy in Baghdad.In the same year, Tehran saw a massive outrage as hundreds of protesters waved Iranian flags, carrying Islam's holy book, chanting, ""Down with the United States, Britain, Israel and Sweden.""Several years ago, Momika fled to Sweden after being charged with numerous legal complaints, which included deception.The Swedish government condemned the Quran desecrations while maintaining its stance on free speech laws. In response to rising security threats, Sweden’s intelligence agency raised the terror alert level to four out of five.After the protests, Sweden revoked Momika’s residency permit in October 2023, citing false claims in his asylum application.Iraq requested his extradition, but Swedish authorities issued a temporary stay on his deportation.Momika later attempted to seek asylum in Norway but was deported back to Sweden, where he was granted a one-year permit.The case is under investigation as Swedish authorities work to determine the motives behind the killing.","Salwan Momika, an Iraqi activist and refugee, was shot dead inside his house on late Wednesday in Sweden.

Water samples tested negative for Campylobacter jejuni, commonly linked to GBS.

PUNE: The search for what triggered the Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) outbreak in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad yielded a loose end Thursday after water samples tested for Campylobacter jejuni , found in stool samples of at least five patients, were found free of the bacterium.As National Institute of Virology (NIV) contemplated other ways to unravel the mystery, the caseload increased to 130 with confirmation of three infections that weren't accounted for in the tally. No fresh case was reported, while 20 patients remain on ventilator support across different hospitals.NIV's next step will be to study the C.jejuni found in patients to determine if they were struck by a more serious strain. Officials said genetically characterising the entire bacterial genome of C. jejuni would likely provide insights into virulence.Dr Shahzad Beg Mirza, microbiologist at Dr DY Patil Medical College, told TOI that the NIV analyses could reveal if a specific strain was responsible for triggering multiple GBS cases.""Some C. jejuni strains with particular genetic traits are strongly linked to GBS. The key mechanism behind GBS involves 'molecular mimicry'. Changes in a bacterial component called LOS (lipooligosaccharide) may be a factor in the outbreak's severity. The genetic study will help determine if the strain involved in this surge carries these high-risk genetic traits,"" he said. Dr Sampada Patwardhan, head microbiologist at Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, said mutations in C. jejuni's genetic makeup could lead to increased virulence.","130 cases of Guillain-Barre Syndrome confirmed in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad.

"Washington DC plane crash: Flight radar shows moment jet and helicopter collided, killing 67",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/washington-dc-plane-crash-flight-radar-shows-moment-jet-and-helicopter-collided-killing-67/articleshow/117767126.cms,"Footage from flight radar captured the moment an American Airlines regional jet collided with a military helicopter near Washington, DC, sending both aircraft crashing into the Potomac River and killing all 64 people on board. The incident, which unfolded late Wednesday, occurred just over three miles from the White House in one of the most tightly controlled airspaces in the world.The crash involved a Bombardier CRJ-701 jet arriving from Wichita, Kansas, with 60 passengers and four crew members, and a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter carrying three soldiers on a training exercise. According to flight tracking data, air traffic controllers had cleared the jet for a shorter runway landing, adjusting its approach moments before the collision. Less than 30 seconds before impact, a controller reportedly asked the helicopter crew if they had the jet in sight, but there was no response. The collision occurred seconds later, cutting off the jet’s radio transponder signal over the middle of the river.Rescue teams worked through the night, but by Thursday morning, the operation turned into a recovery mission. Officials reported that the wreckage of both aircraft had been located in the river, with the jet found in three sections, upside down in waist-deep water. At least 28 bodies had been recovered by early Thursday.The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has launched an investigation into the crash, examining communication records between air traffic controllers and the two aircraft. One controller was handling both helicopter and fixed-wing traffic at the time, a duty typically split between two people. An internal Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) report described this as an unusual configuration, though a source familiar with tower operations maintained that staffing levels were normal.President Donald Trump addressed the crash in a White House news conference, declaring that there were no survivors. He observed a moment of silence but then criticised air traffic management, blaming diversity initiatives at the FAA without providing evidence. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth indicated that altitude appeared to be a key factor, as the helicopter was restricted to 200 feet at the time of the incident.The victims included teenage figure skaters from the Skating Club of Boston, their coaches, and parents, returning from a championship development camp. Also among the dead were four union steamfitters, three Fairfax County students, six parents, and two Chinese nationals, according to officials. Army aviation officials stated that the helicopter crew was highly experienced, with extensive knowledge of flying in the congested Washington airspace.","The crash involved a Bombardier CRJ-701 jet with 60 passengers and four crew members, and a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter carrying three soldiers on a training exercise.

'Very mediocre': Trump on Obama-era aviation standards



'Biden changed them back to lower than ever'



'Signed executive order to set highest aviation standard possible'

US President Donald Trump has assured that his administration will set the ""highest possible bar for aviation safety"" in the country after Washington DC plane crash that killed 67 on Wednesday.Further, he criticized diversity efforts at the federal aviation administration, claiming they lowered standards for air traffic controllers. He accused the Barack Obama administration of deciding the FAA workforce was ""too white"" and also blamed the Joe Biden administration and transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg.Officials have recovered the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder, commonly known as black boxes, from the American Airlines plane, CBS News reported.The collision occurred at around 9pm (local time) within restricted airspace, about three miles from the White House and the US Capitol. By Thursday morning, authorities had transitioned from a search-and-rescue operation to a recovery effort.Trump said that there were some ""very strong opinions and ideas"" that might have led to the crash. He said that FAA and the NTSB and the US military would be investigating the matter.We do not know what led to this crash, but we have some very strong opinions and ideas, and I think we'll probably state those opinions now because over the years I've watched as things like this happen and they say, 'Well, we're always investigating,'"" he said.""And then the investigation, three years later, they announce it. 'We think we have some pretty good ideas.' But we'll find out how this disaster occurred and will ensure that nothing like this ever happens again,"" he added.Trump blamed diversity requirements at the FAA and his Democratic predecessors for the crash, claiming lax standards for air traffic controllers played a role. However, he provided no evidence linking diversity programs to the crash.""For some jobs, we need the highest level of genius,"" he said.""The FAA's diversity push includes focus on hiring people with severe intellectual and psychiatric disabilities. That is amazing. And then it says, FAA says, people with severe disabilities are most underrepresented segment of the workforce and they want them in and they want them . They can be air traffic controllers. I don't think so. This was in January 14th, so that was a week before I entered office. They put a big push to put diversity into the FAA's program,"" he said.When asked how he had drawn this conclusion, Trump replied: ""Because I have common sense. OK? And unfortunately, a lot of people don't. We want brilliant people doing this. This is a major chess game at the highest level. When you have 60 planes coming in during a short period of time, and they're all coming in different directions, and you're dealing with very high-level computer, computer work and very complex computers.""The US president claimed that ever since Federal Aviation Administration was being overseen by secretary Pete Buttigieg, the aviation safety had become a ""disaster.""""That's the guy's a real winner. Do you know how badly everything's run since he's run this Department of Transportation? He's a disaster. He was a disaster as a mayor. He ran his city into the ground and he's a disaster now,"" he said.""He's just got a good line of bullshit. The Department of Transportation, his government agency charged with regulating civil aviation while he runs it, 45,000 people and he is run it right into the ground with his diversity. So I had to say that it's terrible,"" he added.Trump claimed that he Obama-era aviation standards were ""very mediocre"" and he changed them to ""extraordinary"" when he took over in 2016.""We must have only the highest standards for those who work in our aviation system. I changed the Obama standards from very mediocre at best to extraordinary. You remember that. Only the highest aptitude, they have to be the highest intellect and psychologically superior people were allowed to qualify for air traffic controllers. That was not so prior to getting there,"" he said.""When I arrived in 2016, I made that change very early on because I always felt this was a job that -- and other jobs too- but this was a job that had to be superior intelligence and we didn't really have that and we had it,"" he added.He then claimed that Joe Biden's presidency since 2020 changed changed the aviation standards ""back to lower than ever before.""""I put safety first, Obama Biden and the Democrats put policy first and they put politics at a level that nobody's ever seen because this was the lowest level. Their policy was horrible and their politics was even worse. So as you know, last week long before the crash, I signed an executive order restoring our highest standards for air traffic controllers and other important jobs throughout the country,"" he said.Trump said that he had signed executive orders to ensure ""highest possible bar for aviation safety"".""About a week ago, almost upon entering office, I signed something last week, that was an executive order, very powerful on restoring the highest standards of air traffic controllers and others, by the way. Then my administration will set the highest possible bar for aviation safety,"" he said.""We have to have our smartest people. It doesn't matter what they look like, how they speak, who they are. It matters - intellect, talent. The word talent. You have to be talented, naturally talented geniuses. You can't have regular people doing that job. They won't be able to do it,"" he added.Talking about the crash, Trump said we had ""a confluence of bad decisions that were made and you have people that lost their lives, violently lost their lives.""""So you had a helicopter going in identical direction. You had a helicopter that was at the exact same height as somebody going in essentially the opposite direction. You had a plane that was following a track, which is a track that every other plane followed and I don't imagine, I know I've heard today that they might've been following the preceding plane, which was pretty close, but not that close, the preceding plane. But you wouldn't have even been able to see that because of the direction that the helicopter was coming in at,"" he said.Trump expressed that having Sean Duffy sworn in as the new transportation secretary was timely.Answering a question on Duffy being confirmed as transportation secretary, he said: ""For sure, we want fast confirmations. And the Democrats, as you know, are doing everything they can to delay. They've taken too long. We're struggling to get very good people that everybody knows are going to be confirmed. But we're struggling to get them out faster. We want them out faster.""""This was a dark and excruciating night in our nation's capital and in our nation's history and a tragedy of terrible proportions. As one nation, we grieve for every precious soul that has been taken from us so suddenly, and we are a country of really, we are in mourning. This is really shaking a lot of people, including people very sadly, from other nations who were on the flight,"" he said.""On behalf of the First Lady, myself and 340 million Americans, our friends are shattered alongside yours and our prayers are with you now and in the days to come. We'll be working very, very diligently in the days to come. We're here for you to wipe away the tears and to offer you our devotion, our love and our support. It's great support. In moments like this, the differences between Americans fade to nothing compared to the bonds of affection and loyalty that unite us all, both as Americans and even as nations. We are one family, and today we are all heartbroken. We're all searching for answers,"" he added.Trump assured people that it was safe to fly and they shouldn't feel hesitant to do so.""No. Not at all. I would not hesitate to fly. This is something that it's been many years that something like this has happened, and the collision is just something that, we don't expect ever to happen again,"" he said""Flying is very safe. We have the safest flying anywhere in the world, and we'll keep it that way,"" he added.","US President Donald Trump has assured that his administration will set the ""highest possible bar for aviation safety"" in the country.

He also indicated that the administration is considering similar measures against China.Speaking to the reporters in the Oval Office of the White House, Trump asserted that, ""I will be putting the tariff of 25 per cent on Canada and, separately, 25 per cent on Mexico. We will really have to do that because we have very big deficits with those countries. Those tariffs may or may not rise with time.""""Mexico and Canada have never been good to us on trade,"" the President said, while adding that both nations have treated the US ""very unfairly"" on trade.""We will be announcing tariffs on Canada and Mexico for several reasons,"" Trump stated, citing unauthorised immigration, drug trafficking, and significant US financial support to both countries through trade deficits as key justifications for the move.When questioned, Trump stated he would conclude Thursday night (local time), whether oil would be included amongst tariffed items.""We're going to make that determination probably tonight on oil. Because they send us oil...It depends on what the price is. If the oil is properly priced, if they treat us properly, which they don't,"" he said.He emphasised that the US could recover ""very quickly,"" stating that it ""does not need"" the products imported from Canada and Mexico.""We have all the oil you need. We have all the trees you need, meaning the lumber. We have more than almost anybody in those two categories. In oil, we have more than anybody,"" the 47th president of the US said.""We don't need anybody's trees, we have great lumber in this country. We have to free them up environmentally, which I can do very quickly,"" he added.""We don't need what they have. For us to be subsidising Canada to the tune of $175 billion a year, and subsidising Mexico to the tune of $250 billion-$300 billion a year,"" he further continued.Regarding China, Trump indicated the possibility of punitive measures against China over its role in fentanyl exports to the US.""Because of that, they're causing us hundreds of thousands of deaths. China is going to end up paying a tariff also for that. We are in the process of doing that. We'll make that determination of what it's going to be,"" he said.""China has to stop sending fentanyl into our country and killing our people,"" Trump added. Fentanyl remains the deadliest drug threat in the country, according to the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).","US President Donald Trump announced plans to impose a 25 per cent tariff on Canada and Mexico starting Saturday.

President Trump signs executive orders on aviation safety

US President Donald Trump on Thursday responded sarcastically when asked if he would visit the plane crash site over the Potomac River in Washington, asking reporters, ""You want me to go swimming?""The deadly mid-air crash between a jet and a military helicopter took place on Wednesday night. The incident is presumed to have claimed all 67 lives on board. According to a report from CNN citing sources, more than 40 bodies have been recovered from the river as of Thursday afternoon.When the reporters at the White House asked whether he would visit the site, Trump responded, ""I have a plan to visit, not the site. Because you tell me, what's the site? The water? You want me to go swimming?""His comments were quickly condemned on social media, with many calling them insensitive and inappropriate in the wake of such a tragedy.""67 people die under his watch, and he makes a joke? Callous, heartless, completely lacking in empathy,"" one user wrote.""We are such a profoundly unserious country sometimes,"" another added.Despite the ongoing investigation into the cause of the crash, Trump was quick to blame former President Joe Biden and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. He signed an executive order titled ""Immediate Assessment of Aviation Safety,"" arguing that DEI policies compromise competency in crucial roles.""We want the most competent people,"" Trump said. ""We don't care what race they are. We want the most competent people, especially in those positions. You're talking about extremely complex things, and if they don't have a great brain, a great power of the brain, they're not going to be very good at what they do and bad things will happen.""When pressed for evidence linking DEI policies to the crash, Trump admitted he had no specifics but insisted his belief was based on ""common sense.""Trump also announced plans to meet with families of the victims but did not specify when. ""I will be meeting with some people that were very badly hurt with their family members, obviously, but I'll be meeting with some of the families, yeah,"" he said.Meanwhile, recovery operations at the crash site were paused Thursday evening due to diminishing daylight and challenging conditions in the water. Officials indicated that further retrieval efforts might require removing aircraft parts from the river.","US President Donald Trump responded sarcastically when asked if he would visit the plane crash site.

(AP)

Here are some takeaways from her confirmation hearing



Gabbard grilled on past meeting with Syria's Assad

Gabbard on Snowden

Democrats question Gabbard's statements on Russia

US Senators from both parties, Democrats and Republicans, questioned Tulsi Gabbard , President Donald Trump’s nominee for director of national intelligence , during her confirmation hearing on Thursday. The discussion was tense at times, suggesting that her confirmation may not be easy.For more than two hours, members of the Senate Intelligence Committee asked Gabbard about her 2017 meeting with Bashar Assad, the former leader of Syria, and her past statements blaming the United States and Nato for provoking Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Also read: Is Hindu-American Tulsi Gabbard of Indian origin? One of the main concerns for both Republicans and Democrats was her position on Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who leaked classified information about government surveillance programs in 2013.When asked repeatedly if Snowden was a ""traitor,"" Gabbard did not directly answer. Instead, she said that he ""broke the law"" and that she would work to prevent future leaks if confirmed. She also said that Snowden ""exposed egregious, illegal and unconstitutional programs that are happening within our government.""Former Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, who ran for president in 2020 before leaving the party and endorsing Trump in 2024, also faced questions about her past remarks on Russia's war in Ukraine. She has been accused of repeating Russian propaganda to justify Putin's invasion.During the hearing, Senator Michael Bennet read some of Gabbard's previous comments, including her statement that Putin had ""legitimate security concerns"" over Nato expansion in Eastern Europe. Bennet said this suggested she believed a ""totalitarian state"" was ""justified in rolling over the peaceful border of Ukraine.""He also pointed out that Russian state TV aired her remarks and referred to her as ""our friend Tulsi.""Gabbard, a lieutenant colonel in the National Guard who served in the Middle East, has no formal intelligence experience.Several committee members appeared dissatisfied with her responses.It is unclear how many Republicans might vote against her. If all Democrats oppose her nomination, even one Republican voting no in the committee could prevent her confirmation from reaching the full Senate.Gabbard does not have a traditional background for leading the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which was established after the September 11, 2001, attacks to improve coordination among intelligence agencies, including the CIA and FBI.She was once viewed as aligned with the political left but has since held a range of political positions, leading some to question her current views.Her supporters highlighted her military service, including her time in the Iraq War, as evidence of her qualifications for the role.","Tulsi Gabbard is President Donald Trump's nominee for director of national intelligence.

Past fatal air crashes

A jet carrying 60 passengers and four crew members collided with a US Army helicopter while approaching Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington, DC Both aircraft fell into the Potomac River, and no one survived.The collision took place around 9 pm (local time) on Wednesday, in an area with restricted airspace about three miles from the White House and US Capitol. By Thursday morning, the search-and-rescue operation had shifted to a recovery effort. The cause of the crash is still unknown.Officials have retrieved the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder, commonly known as black boxes, from the American Airlines plane, CBS News said.These recorders could provide insights into what happened during the flight. According to CBS, the National Transportation Safety Board will analyze them at a lab near the crash site.The US Federal Aviation Administration reported that the crash involved a regional jet from Wichita, Kansas, preparing to land, and a military helicopter carrying three soldiers on a training exercise. Weather conditions were clear.As the jet neared the airport, air traffic controllers asked American Airlines Flight 5342 if it could land on a shorter runway, and the pilots agreed. The plane adjusted its approach, and controllers cleared it to land.Less than 30 seconds before impact, a controller asked the helicopter crew if they could see the plane. Moments later, another message instructed the helicopter to let the jet pass. There was no response before the aircraft collided.Flight tracking data indicated that the jet’s transponder stopped transmitting about 2,400 feet short of the runway, roughly above the middle of the Potomac River. Officials found the jet upside-down in three sections in waist-deep water. The helicopter’s wreckage was also recovered from the river.Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) are working to retrieve data recording devices from both aircraft.US Federal investigators will examine communications between the aircraft and air traffic controllers, pilot actions, and flight altitudes.News agency Associated Press, quoting an FAA report, said that only one controller was handling helicopter and airplane traffic at the time. Usually, two controllers are assigned, but workstations are sometimes combined during shift changes, breaks, or when air traffic is low.President Donald Trump , transportation secretary Sean Duffy , and secretary of the Army nominee Daniel Driscoll said the crash appeared preventable.Trump blamed diversity efforts at the Federal Aviation Administration for lowering standards for air traffic controllers. He blamed the Obama administration, claiming it had determined that the FAA workforce was ""too white.""He blamed the Biden administration, too, and its secretary of transportation, Pete Buttigieg .""That guy is a real winner,"" Trump said, sarcastically. ""He's a disaster.""US President Donald Trump claimed, without evidence, that diversity initiatives had weakened air safety and questioned the actions of a US Army helicopter pilot involved in the midair collision with a commercial jet.Officials have not yet determined the cause of the crash, and Trump acknowledged it was too early to draw conclusions. However, while calling on the country to pray for the victims, he also speculated on the incident and made political statements, a time when presidents are usually expected to provide reassurance and factual updates.“Some really bad things happened and some things happened that shouldn’t have happened,"" Trump said from the White House briefing room, located a few miles from the crash site.He blamed former President Joe Biden’s administration for pushing the FAA to hire workers under diversity and inclusion policies. He claimed this led to the hiring of people with intellectual disabilities, psychiatric conditions, hearing and vision impairments, epilepsy, paralysis, and dwarfism.Trump did not provide any proof that unqualified individuals were placed in key positions like air traffic control. He also admitted there was no evidence that controllers at Reagan National Airport had made any errors.When asked why he was blaming diversity policies, Trump responded, ""because I have common sense, and unfortunately a lot of people don’t.”This was the deadliest US air crash in nearly 24 years. 28 bodies have been recovered so far, including those of the three soldiers on the helicopter.Among the passengers were members of the Skating Club of Boston returning from a development camp following the 2025 US Figure Skating Championships in Wichita. Fourteen members of the skating community were on the plane, including teenage figure skaters Jinna Han and Spencer Lane , their mothers, and two coaches, Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov , who were world champions in 1994.Three students and six parents from Fairfax County, Virginia, were also on board.Army aviation chief Jonathan Koziol said the helicopter crew was experienced and familiar with flying in Washington’s congested airspace. Their names have not been released.Reagan National Airport is located along the Potomac River, southwest of Washington. It is a preferred airport due to its proximity to the city. Operations resumed on Thursday after being halted following the crash.Transportation secretary Sean Duffy said the flight paths of both aircraft before the crash were typical for the area.""I would just say that everyone who flies in American skies expects that we fly safely,” he said. “That when you depart an airport, you get to your destination. That didn’t happen last night, and I know that President Trump, his administration, the FAA, the DOT, we will not rest until we have answers for the families and for the flying public.”Federal authorities and aviation experts have raised concerns about rising close calls between planes. In May, an American Airlines plane at Reagan aborted takeoff to avoid a collision with another aircraft landing on an intersecting runway. This was the second such incident at the airport in six weeks.The military helicopter was a UH-60 Black Hawk based at Fort Belvoir, Virginia.The jet was a Bombardier CRJ-701, built in Canada in 2004. It had twin engines and could carry up to 70 passengers.Fatal commercial plane crashes in the US are rare. The last major incident occurred in 2009 near Buffalo, New York, when a Bombardier DHC-8 crashed into a house, killing all 45 passengers, four crew members, and one person on the ground.In November 2001, an American Airlines flight crashed in a New York neighborhood shortly after taking off from Kennedy Airport, killing all 260 people on board.The crash on Wednesday was similar to the 1982 Air Florida disaster, where a plane crashed into the Potomac River, killing 78 people. That crash was caused by bad weather.","A jet carrying 60 passengers and four crew members collided with a US Army helicopter while approaching Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington, DC.

In addition, Daniel Driscoll, President Trump's nominee for army secretary, told a Senate hearing that the crash appears to have been preventable, and he raised questions about whether training should take place near a busy airport. Hegseth saidthat there appears to have been an elevation issue with the Black Hawk, and said army investigators were on the ground looking into the matter.

These symptoms typically occurred after experiencing loud sounds accompanied by severe discomfort in their ears and head.These incidents weren't isolated to this group. Additional American citizens have reported comparable health issues.""Havana Syndrome"" received its name from media outlets due to the initial cluster of reported cases in Cuba. Subsequently, similar incidents have been documented across multiple nations—including Austria, China, Colombia, Georgia, Germany, India, Poland, Russia, Vietnam, and within the United States mainland.Those affected primarily were federal staff working in intelligence operations and various government departments, along with their family members. Incidents occurred at their workplaces, homes, and during regular travel.Although symptoms varied amongst individuals, some cases resulted in enduring problems affecting cognitive function, sensory processing, and equilibrium.According to a 2022 CIA intelligence assessment , the unexplained physiological symptoms experienced by diplomats were not attributed to a coordinated effort by any hostile nation.A subsequent intelligence community evaluation revealed that two out of seven intelligence agencies now suggest the possibility that a foreign entity might have created or utilised a device responsible for these unexplained health incidents.","Donald Trump's pick for Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said she looks forward to addressing the reported Havana syndrome case during her confirmation hearing.
