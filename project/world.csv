NEW DELHI: Violence broke out in Nagpur’s Hansapuri area as unidentified individuals vandalized shops, set vehicles on fire, and hurled stones, following an earlier clash in the Mahal area that had already escalated tensions in the city, according to reports.The unrest intensified after rumours circulated about the burning of a religious book, triggering widespread stone-pelting, vandalism, and arson.Mahal and Hansapuri were the worst-affected areas, with vehicles torched and shops damaged by unidentified attackers. The violence erupted just two kilometres from the RSS headquarters, heightening security concerns.To control the situation, Nagpur Police imposed prohibitory measures under Section 163 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita and enforced Section 144, which bans large gatherings. A curfew has been imposed in several areas. The police are reviewing CCTV footage to identify others involved.At least 10 anti-riot commandos, two senior police officers, and two firemen sustained serious injuries during the violence, while a constable remains in critical condition in the hospital.Mobs set fire to two bulldozers and 40 vehicles, including police vans, as security forces faced challenges in controlling the situation. In response, police launched a large-scale crackdown, arresting 50 rioters, while the ministry of home affairs (MHA) sought a report on the unrest.Nagpur gears up for PM Modi's expected visit amid unrestAs Nagpur deals with recent violence, the city is preparing for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's expected visit on March 30. This will be his first public appearance alongside RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat since starting his third term.Nagpur Police Commissioner Ravinder Singal assured residents that the situation is now under control and urged them not to believe in rumours. ""We have imposed Section 144, and everyone has been told not to step out unnecessarily or take the law into their own hands. Do not believe rumors. Except for this area, the entire city is peaceful,"" he said.Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis called for peace, highlighting Nagpur's history of communal harmony. ""Nagpur is a peaceful city where people share in each other's joys and sorrows. Do not believe any rumors,"" he said.Meanwhile, Congress leader Pawan Khera attacked the BJP-led state government, blaming it for failing to maintain law and order and accusing political parties of fuelling tensions.""If the VHP and Bajrang Dal organized a protest demanding the removal of Aurangzeb's tomb, did the government make no arrangements to maintain law and order?"" he questioned.Security forces are conducting searches to arrest those responsible for the violence. Authorities have asked people to remain calm, avoid unnecessary travel, and not spread misinformation. The situation is being closely monitored to prevent further disturbances.The unrest also sparked a political row in the Maharashtra Assembly . State Congress chief Harshvardhan Sapkal compared CM to Mughal ruler Aurangzeb, calling him a cruel ruler. His remarks led to an uproar in the ongoing Budget session, with Mahayuti leaders demanding legal action against him.The Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Bajrang Dal held a demonstration in Nagpur on Monday, demanding the removal of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb's grave in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar. Right-wing activists gathered at the statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in the Mahal area, chanting slogans and burning an effigy of Aurangzeb.This controversy over Aurangzeb has also been fuelled by the newly released Vicky Kaushal-starrer film Chhava , which portrays the conflict between Maratha ruler Chhatrapati Sambhaji and Aurangzeb after Chhatrapati Shivaji's death.The issue ties into a larger historical shift, as Aurangabad was officially renamed Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar in June 2022 to honor Sambhaji Bhosale, the second Chhatrapati of the Maratha Empire.","Violence broke out in Nagpur’s Hansapuri area as unidentified individuals vandalized shops, set vehicles on fire, and hurled stones.

Unlike in other states, the Omar Abdullah-led NC govt does not control J&K police, who are under the Centre-appointed lieutenant-governor (LG) Manoj Sinha in the Union Territory.The MLAs also pressed for action against cops for allegedly beating up protesting women mourners after the second body was found in a decomposed condition Sunday in a river in J&K’s Kulgam district . The other had been found nearby on March 13.Showkat Ahmad Bajad and brother Riyaz had been missing since Feb 13. There is still no trace of Mukhtar Ahmad Awan village, a relative of the brothers who had accompanied them to a wedding in the Mir Bazar area of the same district the day all three went missing. The three worked in a brick kiln.“It seems part of the pattern,” People’s Democratic Party (PDP) legislator Waheed Parra said on Monday. He alleged several such unexplained deaths in J&K in the past few months within the nomadic Gujjar community. Parra cited another youth’s suicide after alleged police torture in Kathua last month as well as the latest deaths in Kulgam, saying all should probed as they were tied to one specific community.NC MLAs Nazir Gurazi and Qaisar Jamsheed Lone expressed concern over the situation in J&K deteriorating to an extent where people just vanished and their bodies were found days and weeks later. Deputy CM Surinder Choudhary of NC pressed for a fair investigation into the Kulgam deaths.On Monday, local authorities did not allow PDP’s Iltija Mufti to visit Kulgam. PDP member Talib Hussain, who was at the site when Showkat’s body was found on Sunday, had accused police of baton-charging mourners when they questioned how investigators had arrived at suicide as the cause of death.Back in the assembly, Sajad Lone, People’s Conference MLA from Handwara, flagged the alleged police atrocities, calling images of a police officer kicking female relatives of the deceased brothers “utterly disdainful”. “The whole action reeks of contempt within the minds of those who are supposed to protect masses. It is almost a daily occurrence,” Lone said. J&K police said they had ordered an inquiry into the officer’s conduct.Investigators said the brothers may have died by suicide. This was based on conclusions of a forensic expert, Dr Azia Manzoor Bhat, that Riyaz’s body indicated he had drowned and the case “doesn’t look homicidal in nature”.On Feb 6, a week before the Kulgam brothers went missing, 25-year-old tribal Makhan Din died by suicide alleging torture by police in Kathua district. He recorded a video before his death claiming cops were forcing him into confessing links with militants.",Showkat Ahmad Bajad and brother Riyaz had been missing since Feb 13. The second body was found in a decomposed condition Sunday in a river in J&K’s Kulgam district.

Police launched a large-scale crackdown, arresting 50 rioters, while the MHA sought a report on the unrest - just two weeks before PM Modi's expected visit to Nagpur. The violence erupted following rumours that protesters from a particular community had burned effigies of Aurangzeb & a religious chadar near Shivaji Putla Square at Mahal Gate - barely 2km from the RSS headquarters.Reports of violence triggered a swift response from another community, with large crowds gathering to demand action against those responsible. The protests escalated into stone-throwing, arson and clashes with police. Officials said misinformation spread via social media played a major role in fuelling the violence.Security forces used riot-control vehicles, including water cannons and tear gas units, to disperse mobs.

Denying bail in less serious offences unfortunate: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/denying-bail-in-less-serious-offences-unfortunate-supreme-court/articleshow/119135920.cms,"Twenty years ago, bail cases did not even reach HCs: Supreme Court



NEW DELHI: Expressing concern over courts denying bail in not very serious cases despite probe being completed, Supreme Court on Monday said it is unfortunate that relief is not being granted in such cases and the apex court has to intervene.A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan said that 20 years ago, bail plea in such cases did not even reach HCs. It is shocking that the apex court is adjudicating such cases and it is flooded with such petitions, it said.SC has repeatedly flagged the issue and appealed to trial courts and HCs to be liberal in granting bail, particularly in not serious and petty offences. It had earlier expressed anguish over ""intellectual dishonesty"" by lower courts & HCs in continuously denying bail to accused in cases involving ordinary infractions, despite its various orders exhorting them to be liberal in granting bail when custody is not needed.While granting bail to an accused who had been in custody for over two years in a cheating case, the bench said, ""It is unfortunate that bail matters in cases triable by magistrate come to SC for bail... We are sorry to say that people are not getting bail... It is unfortunate"". SC noted that the bail plea of the accused was rejected by a trial court and Gujarat HC, despite probe in the case completed and a chargesheet filed.Flagging the issue of SC being flooded by bail petitions as accused were coming to it for the relief, the bench said, ""It is shocking that SC has to deal with such cases. Twenty years ago, such cases did not come to HCs but now it is SC, which is deciding such cases.""Observing that in a democracy there was no place for a police state where probe agencies can arrest people unnecessarily and in a mechanical way, SC in 2022 put a curb on agencies from arresting people in cognisable offences punishable up to 7 years' jail term, where custody is not needed, & had asked criminal courts to protect the liberty of people and be liberal in granting bail.It held that the accused, who was not arrested during probe and had cooperated in the investigation, should not be taken into custody after chargesheet had been filed. It had also appealed to Centre to frame a new law to streamline the process of granting bail, saying there was ""pressing need"" for it, and ruled that regular bail application of an accused had to be decided normally within two weeks and anticipatory bail within six weeks.""Courts tend to think that the possibility of a conviction being nearer to rarity, bail applications will have to be decided strictly, contrary to legal principles,"" court had said.","Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan said that 20 years ago, bail plea in such cases did not even reach HCs.

NAGPUR: Violent clashes broke out in central Nagpur late Monday after protests demanding the removal of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb's tomb in Khultabad spiralled into chaos, leaving dozens wounded and causing widespread destruction.At least 10 anti-riot commandos, two senior police officers, and two firemen suffered serious wounds in the unrest, while a constable remains in critical condition in hospital. Mobs torched two bulldozers and 40 vehicles, including police vans, as security forces struggled to contain the violence. Police launched a large-scale crackdown, arresting 50 rioters, while the MHA sought a report on the unrest - just two weeks before PM Modi's expected visit to Nagpur. The violence erupted following rumours that protesters from a particular community had burned effigies of Aurangzeb & a religious chadar near Shivaji Putla Square at Mahal Gate - barely 2km from the RSS headquarters.Reports of violence triggered a swift response from another community, with large crowds gathering to demand action against those responsible. The protests escalated into stone-throwing, arson and clashes with police. Officials said misinformation spread via social media played a major role in fuelling the violence.Security forces used riot-control vehicles, including water cannons and tear gas units, to disperse mobs. DCPs Archit Chandak and Niketan Kadam were wounded while attempting to control the crowds. Firefighters were also caught in the crossfire as they tried to extinguish burning vehicles. Several neighbourhoods remained tense as sporadic violence continued.Nagpur police commissioner Ravinder Singal deployed more than 1,000 officers and imposed prohibitory orders in Mahal, Chitnis Park Chowk and Bhaldarpura, restricting movement in the most sensitive areas. Key roads were sealed off. Reinforcements and intelligence teams worked to prevent further escalation. However, sporadic stone-throwing continued into the night.Police deployed surveillance teams with CCTV-equipped vehicles and public address systems to monitor the situation and issue warnings. Authorities also activated local peace committees, urging community leaders to intervene and defuse tensions.Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis and Union minister Nitin Gadkari appealed for calm. ""Nagpur has always been a peaceful city where people coexist in harmony. I urge citizens not to believe rumours and cooperate with law enforcement,"" Fadnavis said. Nagpur guardian minister Chandrashekar Bawankule visited the affected areas.Central Nagpur MLA Pravin Datke alleged that ""outsiders"" were brought in to incite violence. ""We have instructed police to identify and take strict action against those responsible,"" he said in Mumbai. In Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar district, where Aurangzeb's tomb is located, VHP and Bajrang Dal staged protests. Protesters warned of the tomb's demolition if govt failed to act.VHP hinted at escalating their agitation across Marathwada and other districts if demands are not met.","Violent clashes broke out in central Nagpur late Monday after protests demanding removal of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb's tomb.

NEW DELHI: The ISI has come under fire after firebrand cleric Mufti Munir Shakir , a known critic of the Pak state was killed in an IED attack in Peshawar two days ago. At his funeral, Mufti's son directly blamed Pakistani intelligence for his death and thousands chanted slogans against the military and the Pak army, accusing them of targeting Pashtuns .A video of the funeral surfaced on X on Monday showing the funeral ground echoing with slogans like ""Yeh Col, General...dehshatgard...Yeh jo dehshatgardi hai iske piche vardi hai...

A case was registered at the Counter Terrorism Department police station against 'unknown militants'.Sources said that an improvised explosive device (IED), containing approximately 600 grams of explosives, was planted near the gate of a mosque and detonated as Mufti Shakir entered the premises.Video footage at the time of the explosion shows he was accompanied by two others at the time of the blast.Known for using FM radio to propagate his thoughts, Mufti Munir Shakir had in the past often called out the Pakistani establishment for misusing Islam for their own gains.Shakir had founded a rebel outfit named Lashkar-e-Islam in 2004, in Bara, Khyber district and had ties to the Deobandi sub-sect Panjpiri besides being associated with an organisation ""Ishaat-e-Tauheed"".In what could worsen Pakistan's internal security challenge, a new militant group, Harqat Inqilab Islami Pakistan (IIP), announced its presence in Pakistan on Monday with group's leader, Ghazi Shahabuddin, releasing a eight-minute video, surrounded by dozens of masked and armed militants, identifying Pakistani security forces as their primary target, reports Rajshekhar Jha. Shahabuddin declared that it would focus its operations in Pakistan and was open to collaborating with other militant groups in the region.

UK royal Prince Harry once again is facing deportation possibility as a US court has ruled that Prince Harry's immigration files be disclosed by Tuesday.Judge Carl Nichols has directed the release of documents pertaining to the Duke of Sussex's US visa application, following a Freedom of Information (FOI)request. The conservative Heritage Foundation, a US think-tank, initiated the FOI request, suggesting the duke potentially omitted previous drug use which could have affected his visa eligibility. Court documents dated 15 March show Judge Nichols instructed the US Department of Homeland Security to provide a redacted version by Tuesday, as reported by Sky News.Despite the same judge ruling in September last year that public interest in Harry's immigration records was not substantial, the judge has now revised his position.The Heritage Foundation sought this reversal, questioning Harry's 2020 US entry following his admissions about cocaine, marijuana and psychedelic mushrooms in his book Spare. In his autobiography, Harry revealed: ""cocaine didn't do anything for me"", and added: ""Marijuana is different, that actually really did help me.""The foundation argued that his visa application responses regarding past drug use could raise concerns about governmental procedures. The Department of Homeland Security's lawyers agreed in February to release censored versions, despite previously denying the FOI request. Department lawyer John Bardo stated in court documents that they would remove information deemed withholdable by the Court.Even US President Donald Trump had addressed these concerns surrounding the UK prince and stated to The New York Post in February that he wouldn't deport Harry, saying: ""I'll leave him alone."" He further took a jab at his wife saying, ""He's got enough problems with his wife. She's terrible.""

Conor McGregor strengthens bond with Donald Trump, ahead of possible Irish Presidential run

While the MMA community is waiting for an announcement that would declare the official comeback of Conor McGregor , ending his long layoff streak, it seems like the Irish fighter has something else on his mind at the moment. McGregor is keen on running for the next Irish President, thereby venturing into his. In his recent post on X, he pleads with the citizens of the country to vote for him instead of any other candidate who would represent the current political parties. McGregor was hinted about his upcoming meeting with the US President, Donald Trump , at the Oval Office in Washington on St. Patrick’s Day.The good terms between Conor McGregor and Donald Trump are not a secret. Trump’s interest in MMA as well as his sound relations with UFC president Dana White, have ultimately led to a good relationship between McGregor and the US president. In a recent interview, when Trump was asked about his favorite Irishman, he immediately talked about McGregor, specifically mentioning how he liked the fighter’s tattoos. To this, McGregor reacted by sharing the interview on his Instagram story and even by leaving a comment on the interview.On March 16, the Irish fighter took to the social media platform X and criticized a controversial judgment passed by the Ireland Judiciary regarding an accused rapist, Randi Gladstone. He was sentenced to a relatively lesser number of years in prison, despite his heinous crime. McGregor posted,“Our judiciary needs a full redress! The current system is actively giving leeway to dangerously imported criminals who have inflicted serious life-altering harm upon citizens of Ireland. It is an absolute travesty! Sentencing should never be reduced for an illegally imported criminal just because prison time in an Irish jail will be “difficult for them."" Our systems need full change!”While he started off talking about how a reform is required within the judicial structure, he went on to vouch for himself for the post of president in the next election.“To vote for anyone else in our upcoming presidential election to make this happen other than me will be the ruination of Ireland. I am of no political party or affiliation. Any other candidate they may propose here in the upcoming race will be a tee up for zero resistance. Ireland, I urge you, I plead! Help me save our country. Otherwise, it is gone forever. I am a real Irish person of no corrupted political affiliation. I am a father, a champion fighter, an employer of multiple 100s of Irish people, as well as worldwide. I have the needs of the people of Ireland in my heart! Vote McGregor!”Towards the end, he mentioned US President Donald Trump and talked about their scheduled meeting on St. Patrick’s Day.“President @realDonaldTrump I depart for Washington today with my family, I look very forward to our meeting tomorrow on St Patrick’s Day at the Oval Office. I AM READY! God speed.”Also read: Michael Chandler comments on Conor McGregor’s return: “I’d give it a slim chance” While it is pretty evident that the Irish fighter is now leaning towards his political venture, does this mean that he might not be returning to the Octagon ever again? Only time will tell.","Conor McGregor is keen on running for the next Irish President, thereby venturing into his political career.

Ranjani Srinivasan News: 'Despite doing nothing wrong...': Columbia student Ranjani Srinivasan's lawyer says she did not 'self-deport' via CBP app,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/despite-doing-nothing-wrong-columbia-student-ranjani-srinivasans-lawyer-says-she-did-not-self-deport-via-cbp-app/articleshow/119119514.cms,"Ranjani Srinivasan's lawyer counters Kristi Noem's claim that she self-deported via CBP app.

Srinivasan's visa illegally revoked, immigration officers visited her without warrant: Attorney



Close on the heels of the arrest of Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil, Ranjani Srinivasan , an Indian-origin PhD student of the same university, leaving the US made the headlines as secretary of homeland security Kristi Noem posted the video of Srinivasan in the airport and claimed that one of the 'terrorist sympathizer' used the department's CBP Home app to self-deport. Self-deportation is leaving the country on one's own instead of being arrested and getting deported by the administration. The Donald Trump administration overhauled a CBP app for facilitating the process where an individual can register, give his or her details and express the intent to leave the country once he or she has no legality for staying in the US.Srinivasan's attorney Nathan Yaffe said Kristi Noem's post was false and it showed that they were targeting Srinivasan. ""Despite doing nothing wrong, Ms Srinivasan booked a flight out of the country to comply with US law, which gave her a 15-day deadline to depart after DHS illegally terminated her student status,"" Yaffe said. “The fact that DHS falsely claims she ‘self-deported’ via a CBP app only underscores that the administration’s targeting of her is built on fabrications, not facts,” Yaffe said to CNN.37-year-old Srinivasan, a Harvard graduate, has been in the US since 2016 and this was her last year in her PhD course. What links her with Mahmoud Khalil is the pro-Palestine protests on the university campus but Srinivasan's attorney claimed that it is a mistaken link between them. She was mistakenly arrested during a protest last year while she was on her way home. She received court summons and was charged but those charges were dismissed as she was not part of the protest.Her lawyers claimed that her student visa was revoked illegally giving her no explanation and the university too complied with the administration and revoked her enrollment.When ICE agents showed up at Srinivasan's door at the same time they picked up Mahmoud Khalil, she did not open the door. Srinivasan’s attorneys say the officers did not have a warrant during their initial visit and threatened to return to her apartment until they could contact her.The DHS said Srinivasan suppressed about the court summons during her visa renewal though they did not clarify whether it was the only reason for her student visa getting revoked.","Ranjani Srinivasan, a Harvard graduate, has been in the US since 2016 and this was her last year in her PhD course.

BREAKING: Israel launches new strikes against Hamas | LiveNOW from FOX

Attacks in Syria and Lebanon

Israel carried out strikes in central Gaza, killing at least 200 people after the ceasefire negotiations fell apart, according to statements from Gaza rescuers and local authorities.""The death toll has reached over 20 martyrs and about 70 wounded as a result of a series of Israeli raids on areas of the Gaza Strip,"" agency spokesman Mahmud Basal told AFP.The reason was the attack was given as ' Hamas 's repeated refusal to release our hostages', according to Israel. Amid the attacks, it also announced closure of schools in the Gaza strip.Soon after the attacks were reported by local authorities, Israeli army, in a post on Telegram, confirmed it was currently ""conducting extensive strikes on terror targets belonging to the Hamas terrorist organisation in the Gaza Strip,"" as reported by AFP.Later , Hamas accused Israel of breaching their truce deal by conducting widespread bombardment of Gaza in the early hours of Tuesday. Hamas issued a statement asserting that Prime Minister Benjamin ""Netanyahu and his extremist government have decided to overturn the ceasefire agreement, exposing the prisoners in Gaza to an unknown fate"". They also warned that they (Israel) put the 'fate of the hostages in jeopardy'.Israel hit areas around the urban refugee camp of Bureij, as per earlier reports. One of the strikes targeted a school serving as a shelter for displaced Palestinians, killing a 52-year-old man and his 16-year-old nephew, according to officials at nearby Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital.Another strike killed three men in Bureij, with the Israeli military stating they were attempting to plant an explosive device, while Gaza’s Hamas-led government said they were collecting firewood. The Israeli military said its operations targeted militants planting explosives.Before the recent attacks, Israel has blocked all food, medicine, fuel, and other supplies for the past two weeks, demanding Hamas accept modifications to their ceasefire deal. The current truce, in effect since mid-January, has seen Israeli forces kill dozens of Palestinians whom the military says approached its troops or entered restricted areas.The strikes have been launched despite a US-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, in place since late November, ending a 14-month conflict. However, both sides have repeatedly accused each other of violating the agreement.Also read: Did Israel consult US before Gaza airstrikes? White House responds Despite ongoing violence, the ceasefire’s first phase has held, allowing the exchange of some hostages held by Hamas for Palestinian prisoners in Israel. Mediators from Egypt, Qatar, and the United States are working on the next phase of the agreement. Israel wants Hamas to release half of the remaining hostages in exchange for negotiations on a lasting truce, while Hamas insists on following the original ceasefire terms, which call for talks on the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. Hamas is believed to be holding 24 living hostages and the bodies of 35 others.In addition to the attacks in Gaza, Israeli airstrikes also hit targets in southern Lebanon and Syria, killing at least 10 people.In Syria, airstrikes hit a residential area in the southern city of Daraa, killing three people and injuring 19 others, including four children, a woman, and three civil defense volunteers, according to the Syrian civil defense agency.

Trump wrote, ""Hunter Biden has had Secret Service protection for an extended period of time, all paid for by the United States Taxpayer. There are as many as 18 people on this Detail, which is ridiculous! He is currently vacationing in, of all places, South Africa, where the Human Rights of people has been strenuously questioned.

'Every SHOT Fired By HOUTHIS...': Trump Vows To Hold Iran Responsible For Next Attack From Yemen

Yemen's Iran-supported Houthi rebels announced on Tuesday that they conducted another strike against a US aircraft carrier group, marking their third such assault within 48 hours.They stated this was in response to American military actions. The Houthi forces revealed on Telegram that they launched missiles and drones at the USS Harry S. Truman carrier group. They specified that this operation was their ""third in the past 48 hours"" and took place in the northern Red Sea region, as reported by AFP.The escalation began on Saturday, when the United States launched a large-scale operation against Houthi targets across Yemen, including Sanaa, Saada, and other provinces. According to the Houthi-run health ministry, these strikes killed at least 53 people, including women and children, and injured around 100 others. US National Security Advisor Michael Waltz confirmed that the strikes “took out multiple Houthi leaders”, and President Donald Trump warned that “hell will rain down upon” the rebels if they continue targeting US forces or international shipping.In response, the Houthis launched their first attack on the USS Harry S. Truman and its strike group on Sunday, firing missiles and drones. Despite Houthi claims, US officials downplayed the incident, stating they were “not tracking any successful strikes” on American vessels. That same day, Houthi media accused the US of additional overnight airstrikes, including an attack on a cotton ginning factory in Hodeida and the Galaxy Leader, an Israeli-linked vessel seized more than a year ago.Following the allegations against US, the Houthis carried out a second assault on the USS Harry S. Truman within 24 hours, continuing their pledge to “meet escalation with escalation.” By Monday, the group announced a third attack, doubling down on its stance that these actions are a direct response to American aggression and a demonstration of solidarity with Palestinians amid the Gaza conflict .Iran, a key backer of the Houthi movement, condemned the US airstrikes. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi insisted that Washington had “no authority” over Yemen or Tehran’s foreign policy and warned of “decisive responses” if hostilities continue. Meanwhile, the United Nations has called on all sides to cease military activity, warning that the escalation risks further destabilizing the region and worsening Yemen’s humanitarian crisis.Since October 2023, the Houthis have launched 136 attacks on military and commercial vessels in the Red Sea, according to conflict monitoring group ACLED, forcing many global shipping companies to reroute their vessels. The group has warned that unless humanitarian aid to Gaza increases, they will “move to additional escalatory options.”While Yemen’s internal conflict has largely been under a fragile ceasefire since 2022, the latest Houthi attacks and US retaliatory strikes threaten to reignite a broader regional conflict, with both sides signaling no intention of backing down.","Yemen's Iran-supported Houthi rebels announced on Tuesday that they conducted another strike against a US aircraft carrier group, marking their third such assault within 48 hours.

After returning to the White House for the second time in January, Trump implemented tariffs on major trading partners, including China, Canada and Mexico, citing trade inequalities and their inadequate control of lethal fentanyl distribution. Last week, China expressed interest in engaging in ""dialogue"" with Washington.Earlier this month, Trump increased his previous 10-per cent general tariff on Chinese goods to 20 percent. In response, Beijing imposed duties of up to 15 percent on various American agricultural products, including soybeans, pork and chicken.China, leading global steel manufacturer, also pledged to implement ""all necessary measures"" in reaction to separate new American tariffs on steel and aluminium.Xi's most recent visit to the United States occurred in November 2023, meeting with Trump's Democratic successor Joe Biden in California, attempting to reduce growing friction between the two global powers.","US President Donald Trump announced on Monday that Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping would likely be visiting the United States in the near future.

Cops called Mangione's personal notebook a manifesto: New defense strategy



What's next?

Four months after his arrest on charges of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson Luigi Mangione has now claimed in the court that he was tricked by the police into giving his DNA samples as he was offered food and a soda at the police station after his arrest. It was just a way to get Luigi Mangione's DNA samples as till then the police had nothing against him, Luigi's lawyer said in a new filing But why this sudden change in the legal strategy? Mangione's legal team is pushing to get rid of all evidence against Mangione.Mangione's attorney Thomas Dickey claimed that while cops were interrogating him, they gave him food which was a ploy to get his DNA samples. Dickey said the DNA samples were ""poisonous fruits"" as they were obtained illegally. They said the cops who approached Mangione on the morning of December 9, five days after Thompson was murdered, had no proper legal reason to do so, it was just a hunch.Dickey claimed in the court that the cops illegally took his notebook and bag and then called it a 'manifesto'. Dickey said it was not fair to call Mangione's personal writing a manifesto. It was ""done solely for the purpose to prejudice (Mangione) and put him in a negative light before the public"".The DNA samples are crucial evidence in the case of Luigi Mangione in Pennsylvania where he faces charges of forgery, giving a fake ID to the police and possession of an unlicensed firearm. If the DNA evidence is cancelled, he would still face federal and New York state charges against him that include first-degree and second-degree murder.","Luigi Mangione was arrested on charges of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December.

Person of interest in Sudiksha Konanki's disappearance case gives cops ultimatum: 'Can't detain any longer',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/person-of-interest-in-sudiksha-konankis-disappearance-case-gives-cops-ultimatum-cant-detain-any-longer/articleshow/119130857.cms,"The mystery of Sudiksha Konanki's disappearance is far from being resolved.

Joshua Riibe's version of Konanki's disappearance



Joshua Riibe , the 22-year-old Iowa man who was last seen with Sudiksha Konanki before her mysterious disappearance from the Dominican Republic resort , has now given the cops an ultimatum that he could not be detained by the police any longer. His attorney Beatriz Santana filed a motion in the court Monday that his client could not be detained any longer without being charged. Riibe has been holed up in the resort and is being grilled by the police as he said he pulled Konanki out of the water and saved her from drowning. But he could not provide any details of what happened next triggering speculations about whether he could actually save Konanki.The DR cops initially thought Konanki got drowned but as no body was found in the last 10 days, now the possibility of foul play is not being dismissed by the cops.Riibe has not been taken into police custody as the cops are questioning him at the resort. He has not been named an accused either, but cops said he is a person of interest in the case. The cops started grilling him after he refused to answer their questions citing his lawyer's advice. Cops have seized Riibe's passport so that he can not leave the country. However, as of now, he was not even allowed to leave the hotel without cops.Joshua Riibe said his friends' group parties with Konanki's group at the bar and then went to the beach. When everyone left the beach, Riibe said he was left alone with Konanki and they were caught in the rough surf. Going by Riibe's version, he managed to pull her out of the water before he passed out on the beach. He said he asked Konanki whether she was fine but got no reply. And then he slept off at the beach. When he woke up in the morning, she was not there.Surveillance footage showed Konanki partying with Riibe on the night of her disappearance.","Joshua Riibe, 22, was last seen with Sudiksha Konanki before her mysterious disappearance from the Dominican Republic resort.

She noted that PM Modi also took this threat seriously and added that the two leaders would work together to identify and defeat the threat.""The long-time unfortunate persecution, killing and abuse of religious minorities like Hindus, Buddhists, Christians and others has been a major area of concern for the US govt and President Trump and his administration,"" Gabbard told NDTV World.Also read: Trade talks happening at very top: Tulsi Gabbard She spoke about the ideology of an ""Islamic Caliphate"" and how extremist elements and terror groups globally aimed for such an outcome.

Trump warns Iran it will face 'consequences' of further attacks from Yemen's Houthi rebels,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-warns-iran-it-will-face-consequences-of-further-attacks-from-yemens-houthi-rebels/articleshow/119130028.cms,"US President Donald Trump on Monday explicitly linked the actions of Yemen's Houthi rebels to the group's main benefactor, Iran, warning Tehran would “suffer the consequences” for further attacks by the group.The comments by Trump on his Truth Social website escalate his administration's new campaign of airstrikes targeting the rebels, which killed at least 53 people this weekend alone and appear poised to continue. Meanwhile, Iran continues to weigh how to respond to a letter Trump sent them last week trying to jump-start negotiations over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program.Houthi supporters themselves rallied in several cities Monday after the strikes, vowing revenge against America and Israel over blocking aid to the Gaza Strip after its war on Hamas there. The Houthis' al-Masirah satellite news channel put young boys on air live, who chanted the group's slogan: “God is the greatest; death to America; death to Israel; curse the Jews; victory to Islam.”“The Yemeni position is an irreversible position (regarding Gaza), so do whatever you (Americans) want, for we are men who fear no one but God,"" said Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, a Houthi leader who spoke to the demonstration in Yemen's rebel-held capital, Sanaa.The United Nations called for a halt to all military activities in Yemen and the Red Sea, urging “utmost restraint” and warning that “any additional escalation could exacerbate regional tensions,” UN deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said Monday.Trump links Iran to the HouthisDescribing the Houthis as “sinister mobsters and thugs,” Trump warned any attack by the group would be met with “great force, and there is no guarantee that that force will stop there.”“Iran has played ‘the innocent victim’ of rogue terrorists from which they’ve lost control, but they haven’t lost control,” Trump alleged in his post. “They’re dictating every move, giving them the weapons, supplying them with money and highly sophisticated Military equipment, and even, so-called, 'Intelligence.'”It's unclear what sparked Trump's post. However, the head of Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard sought to separate the Houthis' actions from those of Tehran this weekend. The Houthis also launched drones and missiles targeting the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier in the Red Sea, though none reached the ship as it continues flight operations in the region.Iran did not immediately comment on the post.“Every shot fired by the Houthis will be looked upon, from this point forward, as being a shot fired from the weapons and leadership of IRAN, and IRAN will be held responsible, and suffer the consequences, and those consequences will be dire!” Trump added.The Houthi rebels attacked over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors, from November 2023 until January this year when a ceasefire began in Gaza. The campaign also greatly raised the Houthis’ profile in the wider Arab world and tamped down on public criticism against their human rights abuses and crackdowns on dissent and aid workers.The Houthis claimed there had been additional US airstrikes overnight, though American officials did not immediately acknowledge them.World Food Program warehouse raided by HouthisIn Saada province, the Houthis' stronghold, the rebels raided a warehouse run by the World Food Program. A member of Yemen's exiled government first reported the Houthis had been taking supplies from the facility without the WFP's permission in the aftermath of the US airstrikes. The United Nations agency later acknowledged the Houthis' actions to The Associated Press.“WFP regrets the de facto authorities' decision to seize some of the commodities,” it said. “These commodities were intended for the most vulnerable food-insecure families. Only WFP and its partners have the authority to distribute them and ensure they reach the intended recipients.”Yemen, at war since the Houthis seized Sanaa back in 2014, has been on the precipice of famine for years. But the UN in February suspended its operations in Saada over security concerns following the detentions of dozens of UN workers and others in recent months. A day later, the WFP announced one of its staffers died while imprisoned by the Houthis.","Houthi supporters rally in several cities, vowing revenge against America and Israel.

Alawieh deported for sympathizing with Hezbollah



Rasha Alawieh , the Lebanese doctor and an assistant professor at Brown University's medical school, who was deported by the Donald Trump administration told the officials that she had religious reasons for which she attended the funeral of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, not a political one. Federal authorities said they found sympathizing photos and videos of prominent Hezbollah figures in a deleted items folder on her cell phone. “CBP questioned Dr Alawieh and determined that her true intentions in the United States could not be determined,” Assistant US Attorney Michael Sady wrote in a court filing Monday.In the ongoing crackdown on immigrants -- both legal, illegal -- 34-year-old Alawieh was deported Friday despite holding an H-1b visa.The deportation involved legal challenges too as a court order against her deportation Friday. CBP official John Wallace told that court that the officials at Boston's Logan Airport did not receive formal notification of the court order before Alawieh was put on an Air France flight bound for Paris. The CBP official said CBP would never defy a court order and that the agency only acts on orders it gets from its legal counsel.“Due to the extremely close timing between the issuance of the court order in this case and the boarding time of [the Air France flight] CBP did not receive the court’s orders until after the flight departed the United States,” Wallace added.Alawieh has been in the US since 2018 when she came on a student visa. As Alawieh arrived at the Boston airport Thursday, she was denied entry as CBP officers started questioning her, searching her phone. Alawieh was asked about the photos and videos of Nasrallah and other Hezbollah leaders. She said she's apolitical and she received those photos on WhatsApp groups. “Due to the extremely close timing between the issuance of the court order in this case and the boarding time of [the Air France flight] CBP did not receive the court’s orders until after the flight departed the United States,” Wallace added.“I think if you listen to one of his sermons you would know what I mean. He is a religious, spiritual person, as I said, he has very high value. His teachings are about spirituality and morality,” she added about the sheikh.On being asked whether she supported Nasrallah, Alawieh said she supported him from a religious perspective. Alawieh also had photos of Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei but she said it was purely a religious thing.Alawieh said she deleted some photos a day or two before arriving in the US as she did not want any perception but she could not delete all.",Lebanese doctor Rasha Alawieh was deported Friday despite holding an H-1b visa.

( The New York Times photo)

An international graduate student at Cornell University filed a lawsuit Saturday to block enforcement of two White House executive orders that, he fears, could result in his deportation from the US for pro-Palestinian activism .The suit was filed by Momodou Taal , a doctoral student in Africana studies at Cornell and an outspoken critic of US policy in West Asia. It cites a threat made by Trump after the arrest and detention of Mahmoud Khalil, a graduate of Columbia University and legal US resident whom the administration is trying to deport. ""This is the first arrest of many to come,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social after federal agents picked up Khalil at his New York City apartment March 8. Trump called pro-Palestinian activists like Khalil ""terrorist sympathizers"" and said ""we will find, apprehend and deport"" them, ""never to return again."" Another Columbia student, Leqaa Kordia, was detained for overstaying her visa.The lawsuit asks for national injunctions to block two executive orders issued in Feb. Both are aimed at the removal or arrest of pro-Palestinian activists or anyone else whom the administration deems guilty of anti-semitic speech . A hearing could be held Monday, according to Taal's lawyer, Eric Lee. Two other plaintiffs - a professor and another student at Cornell both American citizens - joined Taal in the suit, arguing that the orders chill their rights to free speech.Taal, 31, is a citizen of both Gambia and the UK. He has become known on the Cornell campus in Ithaca, New York, as a leading pro-Palestinian voice. In the lawsuit, Taal argues his activism has made him a target of the Trump administration's plans, based partly on a list that was circulated by a pro-Zionist group, Betar. nyt","The suit was filed by Momodou Taal, a doctoral student in Africana studies at Cornell.

At least two Pakistsoldiers and nine terrorists were killed after the Pak security forces raided two hideouts used by an armed group in the restive northwest, triggering gun battles, Al Jazeera reported.The raids were conducted on Saturday in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Mohmand and Dera Ismail Khan districts, which border Afghanistan.According to local police, the fighters belonged to Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), also known as the Pakistani Taliban.Notably, TTP -- banned in Pakistan -- is a separate group but an ally of the Afghan Taliban, who reseized power in neighbouring Afghanistan in August 2021 as the United States and other NATO troops were in the final stages of a withdrawal from the country after 20 years of war.Many TTP leaders and fighters have found sanctuaries and have even been living openly in Afghanistan since the Taliban takeover, which also emboldened the Pakistani Taliban, according to Al Jazeera.In a separate incident on Saturday, fighters ambushed security forces in northwestern Pakistan's Kurram district, bordering Afghanistan, the report said, citing local police. Authorities have yet to confirm any casualties in that attack.Pakistan's military is engaged in an ongoing operation in Kurram, an area that has witnessed years of violence between Sunni and Shia Muslim communities, as reported by Al Jazeera. Hundreds of people have been killed in fighting between armed groups, exacerbating tensions in the region.Kurram has remained isolated since last November, after authorities blocked key roads following sectarian violence. The closure has led to severe shortages of medicine and food, deepening a humanitarian crisis.In another incident, a bomb exploded outside a mosque in the northwestern city of Peshawar, killing a religious leader, local police said on Saturday. It was unclear who was behind the attack, and an investigation was being conducted.","Pakistani security forces raid two hideouts used by an armed group, triggering gun battles.
