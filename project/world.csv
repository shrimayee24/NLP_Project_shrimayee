Guterres underscored that science-based governance could act as an accelerator for solutions, making technological progress safer, fairer, and more inclusive. He urged countries to prepare, protect, and invest in people, noting that international cooperation is currently strained by declining trust and rising technological rivalry.

During his visit, Guterres also highlighted India's initiatives to expand clean energy access and appreciated the country's leadership in convening the AI Impact Summit, as well as its longstanding collaboration with the United Nations across sectors.

At Rashtrapati Bhavan, President Murmu welcomed Guterres’ proposal to establish a global scientific panel on artificial intelligence to serve all of humanity, according to an official release. She reaffirmed India’s commitment to multilateralism at a time when global uncertainties are placing the system under strain.

The President observed that multilateral institutions, particularly the United Nations Security Council, must undergo urgent reform to reflect contemporary geopolitical realities. She stressed that the existing framework of the Security Council is outdated and that the Global South must be given a greater voice in global decision-making. Reform, she said, is key to preserving the relevance and effectiveness of the United Nations.

While acknowledging that the UN-80 initiative offers a useful platform for reform, President Murmu emphasised that any restructuring exercise must safeguard the developmental priorities of the Global South.

She concluded the meeting by extending her good wishes to Guterres for the remainder of his tenure and reiterating India’s full support for multilateralism and international cooperation.","Guterres underscored that science-based governance could act as an accelerator for solutions, making technological progress safer, fairer, and more inclusive.

As Muslims across the world began observing the holy month of Ramadan on Wednesday, the usual fervour associated with the festival is highly subdued in Iran, according to Iranians living in India and western countries, reports Kalyan Das. Members of the diaspora told TOI that many families back home are grappling with grief following recent anti-regime protests and the deaths of loved ones, leading to a marked shift in how the holy month is being observed. Mohammed (who asked to be identified by his first name), an Iranian who has been living in Delhi for nearly a decade, said conversations with his family reflect deep anguish and anger. “How could we mark the month when there have been so many deaths during the recent anti-regime protests?” he said.As Muslims across the world began observing the holy month of Ramadan on Wednesday, the usual fervour associated with the festival is highly subdued in Iran, according to Iranians living in India and western countries.

It is an act of defiance to show the regime that killing protesters has not silenced dissent but inspired more to stand up peacefully. ”He added that videos shared by his relatives show families clapping and singing at grave sites. “Earlier, families would wear black and mourn. Now, many are suppressing visible sorrow and choosing symbolic gestures of resistance. Through that act, they are challenging the regime,” he said.TOI independently verified the claims and came across several such videos in which families appeared to be singing and clapping near the graves of relatives who allegedly died during the unrest.Bahaar Ghorbani, another Iranian living in India, claimed that nearly 40,000 people, including women and children, were killed during the protests. “In recent years, more people have been openly eating during fasting hours as a mark of dissent. Authorities no longer strictly act against those not observing the fast. This time, the mood is even more intense because of the mass killings. Ramadan feels different,” she said.Helma, an Iranian based in Hyderabad, pointed to economic hardship as another reason behind the subdued atmosphere. “Many people cannot afford basic food items. There is also anxiety over a possible war with the US, which people fear would worsen the situation. In such circumstances, people are struggling to focus on religious observances,” she added.In Dec last year, demonstrations broke out across several cities in Iran amid widespread unrest directed at the govt and mounting economic distress. The upheaval was described by observers as the most significant challenge to the establishment since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.The subsequent security crackdown involved the use of live ammunition against protesters.Rights groups and activists have alleged that the violence led to tens of thousands of deaths, describing it as among the deadliest episodes in the country’s modern history.","As Muslims across the world began observing the holy month of Ramadan on Wednesday, the usual fervour associated with the festival is highly subdued in Iran.

Following the threat, the MLA's security has been enhanced. The development comes close on the heels of a separate case in which Akot BJP city president Harish Tawari was allegedly threatened through Signal messaging app.According to police, Tawari first received a message on Feb 12 asking him to arrange Rs2 crore by collecting it from Akot BJP MLA Prakash Bharsakale. Based on Tawari's complaint, a case has been registered with the cyber police station in Akola. Investigators have treated the message as a serious extortion threat and launched a probe.MLA Sajid Khan Pathan allegedly received a phone call demanding ₹10 crore. Police sources said the call was received on Feb 17 at around 3pm, and the caller allegedly warned the MLA to pay the amount within two days or face severe consequences.Investigators have traced the origin of the call to California, US.Following the threat, Pathan's security has been tightened and four armed police personnel have been deployed for his protection. After the call, the MLA met Akola superintendent of police Archit Chandak and other senior officers and formally lodged a complaint.Police said Lonkar is a native of Nevri Budruk village in Akot taluka of Akola district. The fact that a BJP city office-bearer and a Congress MLA were allegedly targeted by the same network has caused serious concern within the Akola police establishment.Who is Shubham Lonkar?According to police records, Lonkar had earlier claimed responsibility for the murder of NCP leader Baba Siddique, and later for the firing incident outside the residence of filmmaker Rohit Shetty.Lonkar had earlier been arrested by Akola police, who seized three pistols and live cartridges from his possession. Investigators believe he was in contact with gangster Lawrence Bishnoi and his younger brother Anmol Bishnoi.Police said Lonkar was a key operator in a weapons-trafficking racket. In the same case, Akot police had also arrested three persons who allegedly procured firearms through him.Investigators further said Lonkar had been living in Pune's Warje area for some time before going absconding. He was later arrested from Pune and subsequently released on bail.Police also claim to possess call recordings of conversations between Lonkar and Lawrence Bishnoi.

"For some Gujarat groups, parental consent for marriage written in ‘constitution’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/for-some-gujarat-groups-parental-consent-for-marriage-written-in-constitution/articleshow/128631922.cms,"A Patidar community meeting last month in Mehsana. Leader of a Patidar group said they want strict laws against ‘sham marriages’

'Violate ban, face boycott'

Notice

'Parents should have say'

'Love marriage no crime'

Gujarat govt’s proposal that couples must inform their parents before tying the knot is yet to become law, but ‘or - ders’ to that effect are al - ready in force in parts of Gujarat, where some villages and communities have come out with detailed ‘codes’ intended to govern how their members marry.The amendments proposed in the state assembly on Friday reflect de - mands and actions being pushed on the ground, with scattered village reso - lutions hardening into communitylevel ‘constitutions’ — resolutions and declarations that threaten couples who marry for love with boycott, ostracism, and exclusion from public life.From gram sabhas in Kheda district to caste organisations of Patidars and Thakors, the consen - sus driving such declarations is that marriage without parental consent threatens tradition, destabilises so - cial order and endangers women.The gram sabha in Nand village in Mahudha taluka recently passed a res - olution imposing total social boycott on couples who marry despite opposi - tion from their families. Such couples are barred from community facilities, religious gatherings and social func - tions. The resolution also caps wed - ding and funeral expenses, prohibits DJs and “objectionable songs”, and imposes fines for violations.Bharat Solanki, the village sar - panch, said rising cases of marriage disputes had led to the decision. “We are a village of 5,000, mostly Thakors and Darbars. There have been sagotra (intra-clan) marriages, which are not permissible. When a couple elopes, it puts parents in an embarrassing po - sition. As these incidents have been rising, we decided to declare a ban on such marriages. Violate the ban, and you face boycott. ”The rules, Solanki insisted, spare no one. All communities in the vil - lage — including OBC and SC fami - lies, which form a minority — are required to comply. “The rules are for everyone. We are not targeting one single group. Violators pay Rs 21,000 fine and are excluded from village gatherings,” he said.Similar ‘rules’ are surfacing else - where, signalling a broader social churn. Village elders argue that couples who elope — their union is known locally as ‘bhagedu lagan’ — disrupt social harmony and bring dishonour to their families.Geni Thakor, Congress MP from Banaskantha who spearheaded the Thakor community’s campaign against such unions, said “the deci - sion was taken because (they) kept seeing fraudulent marriages"".“A girl marrying outside her com - munity weakens its social fabric. There have been instances where women are deceived by men, subject - ed to abuse and, in some cases, driven to suicide. Our aim is to protect our daughters,” said Thakor, who also cit - ed demographic factors, saying “the Patidar sex ratio is collapsing”.Following the proposed amend -ments, Thakor said she “was the first to raise the issue of ‘bhagedu lagan’ when the ‘love jihad’ bill (Gujarat Free - dom of Religion (Amendment) Bill, 2021) was tabled in the assembly”. She insisted that “99% of love marriages fail and bring misery to the girl”. Asked about the basis for her claim, she said, “I have found this in villages; it might not be the case in big cities.”Among Patidars, opposition to such self-choice marriages has simmered for years. Lalji Patel, who heads the Sardar Patel Group (SPG), said the movement crystallised around paren tal anguish.“During Covid, parents came to us, begging us to rescue daughters trapped in sham marriages,” Patel said. “That is why we initiated these measures.” He said the SPG has been demand - ing that the legal age of marriage for women be raised from 18 to 21 even as he acknowledged that the Constitution allows adults to marry by choice. “But society matters. Parents are every - thing. They should have a say.”One pamphlet distributed by the Patidar Sena in Mehsana went beyond parental consent to call for sweeping changes, including par - ents’ signatures on marriage regis - tration for those aged 30 or younger. It also wanted court marriages to be restricted to the bride’s local juris - diction, 40 to be the minimum age of witnesses, and couples who marry by choice after 30 to deposit Rs 10 lakh in their parents’ accounts and forfeit any claim to family property.“These demands are born from the pain parents have gone through,” said Satish Patel, leader of the Mehsana Patidar Sena. Asked about the proposed rules, he said they were “not fully satisfied” as they also wanted “only blood relatives of girls to be signatories in the marriage registration as that ensures both parents and relatives bear full accountability for every such union”.Community leaders backing these demands insist they are not against people choosing whom they want to marry, but against secrecy and deception. “If a couple wants to marry and the parents agree, we have no objection,"" Lalji Patel said. “But parents must be involved. They’re the ones who will always shield their daughters.” He, too, said the latest proposal falls short of their demands.“The govt speaks of merely ‘informing’ parents, as though a notification is sufficient. We have demanded that parents’ consent be made mandatory.”Legal experts warn that such meas - ures strike at the core of constitu - tional freedoms but those who fall foul of such diktats say that they have to face serious difficulties in their day-to-day lives.A Dalit man from northern Gujarat who married a woman from the Darbar community in 2015 — Darbars are placed higher in the social hierarchy—said they have had to change their residence at least 50 times and stay off social media to avoid being traced. Both hold postgraduate de - grees but cannot find stable work.“We’ve not been able to work at one place. We are dependent on daily wages even though we both hold PG degrees,” the man said. “We took up jobs with NGOs, but my wife’s family members or relatives traced me there during fieldwork.”Kaushik Parmar, a lawyer from Mehsana who works with intercaste couples, slammed the proposed changes in the marriage registration rules, saying that “love marriage is not the enemy of society; it is the right of a free citizen”. “Every attempt to curb it weakens the Constitution and strengthens caste hierarchies. If we truly want a progressive, equal, and just society, we must see love marriage not as a crime but as an instrument of social change. These rules amount to the murder of democracy,” he said.",Gujarat govt’s proposal that couples must inform their parents before tying the knot is yet to become law.

BENGALURU: Haunted by morbid thoughts of who would take care of his wife upon his death, a former Isro staffer, 76, allegedly strangled his wife to death on Wednesday morning, contemplated ending his life by suicide, but panicked and aborted the plan.Police officers probing the case said Nageshwar Rao, who retired as a team leader, is under treatment for unstated psychological issues. The incident took place in a senior living community in Bengaluru's Whitefield area, a first such case in many years.According to preliminary investigations, Rao used a bath towel to smother Sandhya Shri, 63, while she was preparing lunch in the kitchen around 10.15am in The Virtuoso in Bommenahalli. Rao has been arrested on charges of murder.The couple from Andhra Pradesh purchased the flat three years ago. Their only daughter is settled in the US. Informed by police, the daughter is flying to Bengaluru, sources said.""After the woman collapsed, Rao sat near her body for 20 minutes. He called a neighbour, asking him to come home immediately as he had killed his wife. The neighbour thought it was a joke. When Rao repeatedly said it, the neighbour rushed in,"" police said.Seeing Sandhya motionless on the floor, the neighbour called a doctor in the apartment. Since many senior citizens live in the apartment, an ambulance and a doctor are deployed round the clock.""The doctor examined Sandhya and declared her dead. Then, the doctor called police,"" an investigating officer said.When police entered the flat, Rao was sitting on the sofa and readily confessed to the incident. ""Yes, I killed her. I may not live more than 3-4 years from now. Who'll look after her after my death? We don't have close relatives in Bengaluru,"" he said.However, when a senior police officer questioned him about the motive, Rao answered the query with a blank stare.The incident has jolted police and geriatric caregivers.

RAIPUR: A puff of cigarette nearly turned into a fireball at Chhattisgarh's Raipur petrol pump after a youth allegedly set a fuel nozzle ablaze using a lighter when asked not to smoke, that triggered flames on a motorcycle and pump. Amid panic, the pump staff averted a major disaster and doused it with a fire extinguisher.The incident took place at a petrol pump in the Urla area on Thursday evening. According to police, two men identified as Dharmendra Kshatri and Imran had arrived at the pump on a motorcycle to refuel.Police said Imran remained seated on the bike while Dharmendra stood nearby. As the fuel tank was opened, Dharmendra allegedly took out a cigarette and tried to light it. When he was asked to stop smoking at the petrol pump, he became enraged and used a lighter to ignite the fuel nozzle pipe, triggering flames.The fire quickly spread to the bike’s fuel tank and the pump machine, causing panic at the site. The two accused, the biker and pump staff rushed away to save themselves as flames flared up.Officials said a pump attendant acted swiftly, pulling away the fuel pipe and switching off the main fuel supply.Using the fire safety kit available at the pump, the staff managed to douse the flames in time, preventing what could have been a major explosion or fire accident.During the chaos, some burning fuel reportedly splashed on the accused as well. After the incident, the duo attempted to flee but were caught by pump staff, who informed the police and lodged a complaint.Urla police later arrested both accused based on the complaint by the pump manager and CCTV footage from the site. Urla inspector Rohit Mahelkar said a case has been registered under sections related to arson and endangering public safety.Police said the quick response by petrol pump employees prevented a potentially catastrophic incident, as the fire could have spread to nearby vehicles and fuel storage areas.","A puff of cigarette nearly turned into a fireball at Chhattisgarh's Raipur petrol pump.

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: One of the three US-sanctioned Iran-linked oil tankers seized by the Indian Coast Guard (ICG) on Feb 6 off the country’s coast had spent days inside Pakistan's maritime boundary with its tracking systems switched off, according to an FIR registered in Mumbai.The ICG had seized three ships — Asphalt Star, Stellar Ruby and Al Jafzia — around 100 nautical miles west of Mumbai for investigation and lodged a police complaint on Feb 15 at the Yellow Gate police station against nine persons, including the owner of the three ships for alleged illegal activities and smuggling oil linked to Iran. There were 55 crew members on board all three seized vessels.Based on the complaint of Aniruddha Dharampal Dabash (40), an ICG commandant, Mumbai police filed an FIR and arrested the captain of MT Asphalt Star and a crew member for their alleged role in oil smuggling and forgery. TOI has the copy of the FIR.On the ship’s presence in the Pakistan maritime zone, the FIR said, “Electronic chart display & information system data of MT Asphalt Star was examined by Coast Guard Officer assistant commandant P Siddharth Ratnam. It was observed that between Jan 20 and Jan 28, the vessel had entered Pakistan’s maritime exclusive economic zone (EEZ).”“On Jan 28, at approximately 11 hours, the vessel had switched off its automatic identification system (AIS), very high frequency (VHF) and all sensors, thereby concealing its identity and carrying out suspicious movements.Upon further questioning, the master stated that the ship’s voyage data recorder (VDR) system had stopped functioning,” it said. All three ships used AIS spoofing and false identity data to evade detection.Jogendar Singh Brar, an Indian national who is currently based in Abu Dhabi, UAE, and is said to be the owner of the ships, is named as one of the accused in the FIR.Through sustained rummaging, corroboration of electronic data on board suspect vessels and verification documents and interrogation of crew, the ICG specialist boarding team established the modus operandi of criminals.“We have arrested Shyam Bahadur Chauhan and one more person in this case. They were produced before a court and sent in police custody till Feb 23,” said a police officer. Chauhan is the master of MT Asphalt Star. In the UAE, Brar claimed that his ships were providing essential supplies to other ships in distress far from the Indian coast and that the ships were not engaged in any illegal activity, say local media reports.The FIR stated that MT Asphalt Star was found to have illegally transferred 30 metric tonnes of heavy fuel oil to MT AL Jafiza in the EEZ of the Indian Ocean by conducting ship to ship operation without informing any Indian govt authorities. It was also found to have illegally transferred 5473 metric tonnes of Bitumen used for road construction to MT stellar Ruby.",One of the three US-sanctioned Iran-linked oil tankers seized by the Indian Coast Guard had spent days inside Pakistan's maritime boundary with its tracking systems switched off.

NEW DELHI: The ministry of external affairs on Friday said the United Nations joint statement India signed was not a ""negotiated document"" that condemned Israel's West Bank expansion.The foreign ministry said New Delhi's stand on the expansion issue was already expressed in the India-Arab League Ministerial meeting that laid out a broader vision for deeper two-way ties, pitched for a sovereign and viable Palestine state living side-by-side with Israel.The meeting had also stressed the need for conducting international relations based on the UN charter.""The statement referred to was not a negotiated document.

SRINAGAR: Operations were suspended at the 450MW stage 1 Baglihar hydropower project on the Chenab river in Jammu and Kashmir after it got flooded two days ago.As water entered the project’s machine room, engineers immediately halted power generation to prevent damage to critical electro-mechanical components. The project, located in Ramban district, is a major contributor to the region’s power supply. As the project’s stage 1 remains suspended, stage 2 which adds another 450 MW capacity, will be operational. It has not been impacted by the flooding, officials said.A senior official called it minor flooding which happened during scheduled maintenance. Stage 1 was anyway scheduled to remain closed for three months for repair works, the official said. “Since stage 1 has to stay shut for 90 days, we will operate stage 2 during the period,” he said.The official said stage 1 typically runs at full load for seven to eight months and at partial load for three to four months annually. Stage 2, however, operates only for about four months, from July to Sept, as per design, as there is not enough discharge to run both stages simultaneously during lean period. “Now that stage 1 is shut down for repairs, we will run stage 2, which otherwise remains closed during the lean period,” he said.","The 450MW stage 1 Baglihar hydropower project on the Chenab river in Jammu and Kashmir got flooded two days ago.

A week after the municipal election results were declared, an unusual post-poll drama is unfolding across several towns in Telangana. Defeated candidates are allegedly going door-to-door, asking residents to return cash and gifts they distributed during the campaign.What began as quiet requests has, in many places, escalated into heated confrontations. Some videos showing some of the defeated candidates or their relatives asking for refunds have gone viral on social media, fuelling public outrage.Reports of clashes between candidates and residents have surfaced from Medchal Malkajgiri, Khammam, Suryapet, Peddapalli, Bhadradri Kothagudem, Jagtial and Nizamabad districts. In several instances, residents said they never demanded the money or gifts given voluntarily, and it was not correct for these to be returned.On the eve of the Feb 10 polling, candidates in some municipalities and wards allegedly distributed cash between Rs 2,500 and Rs 3,000 for each vote. Pressure cookers and sarees were allegedly given to women voters. After losing, some candidates — across party lines as well as independents — began suspecting certain colonies had not supported them.One viral clip shows a man and a woman, linked to a prominent party, carrying sarees away. When probed, the woman is heard saying if they got one vote, the opposition got four.

An additional district and sessions court in Manjeri town of Kerala’s Malappuram district on Friday sentenced five men to life imprisonment for beating a 42-year-old person to death in Mankada village in a 2016 moral policing case.The lynching was akin to terrorism, judge Thusar M observed while pronouncing the verdict. The court had held the five men guilty under IPC sections 302 (murder), 143 (unlawful assembly), 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting armed with dangerous weapon) and 449 (house trespass to commit an offence punishable with death).The convicts were identified as Nayakath Abdul Nassar (46), his brother Sharafudheen (39), P Suhail (40), P Abdul Ghafoor (60) and P Zakkeer Hussain (49), all natives of Koottil, near Mankada. In addition to life sentence, the two brothers and Ghafoor were awarded rigorous imprisonment of five years and 11 months and a fine of Rs 15,000 each.The other two accused, who were also found guilty of destruction of evidence, were handed additional seven years and 11 months of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs 20,000 each. All sentences will run concurrently. Three other accused — C Shafeeq (40), M Parambath Mansoor (40), and A Abdul Naser (41) — were acquitted due to lack of evidence.According to the prosecution, the accused forcibly broke open the door of a house where the sister-inlaw of P Zakkeer Hussain lived alone, in the early hours of June 28, 2016, alleging that the victim, Nazeer Hussain, had visited at an odd hour. The accused beat up Hussain brutally with sticks for around two hours, leaving him unconscious. The court noted the accused did not even give water to the victim, nor allowed to be taken to hospital, showing a cruel and inhuman attitude.Special public prosecutor P G Mathew said the visuals retrieved from the phones of two of the accused, who had recorded the brutal assault, turned crucial in their conviction.","The lynching was akin to terrorism, judge Thusar M observed while pronouncing the verdict.

SRINAGAR/JAMMU: J&K CM Omar Abdullah on Friday defended an order by local authorities in Jammu’s Kishtwar regulating collection of zakat (charity) during Ramadan amid widespread criticism of the move, including by some of his cabinet colleagues and ally Congress.Speaking in the assembly, Omar urged legislators “not to politicise every issue” and clarified that the Feb 18 order was issued by the Kishtwar deputy commissioner (DC) after consulting religious leaders as a safety measure to check donation deceptions. “We shouldn’t mix religion with politics. Some matters require dialogue and understanding at the local level rather than political confrontation,” Omar said.The DC’s order says the aim is to check “unregulated and unauthorised collection of donations by individuals” in Ramadan. It warns against collection of donations by “unregistered” individuals or institutions without permission from Wakf Board or sub-divisional magistrates.Omar referred to a House debate on Thursday when Congress MLAs Nizamuddin Bhat and GA Mir had raised the issue and denounced the order as an interference in religious affairs.“I looked into the matter and found that the DC did not issue the order on his own,” Omar said.According to Omar, many had raised concerns about the misuse of charitable collections at a meeting ahead of Ramadan with religious leaders in Kishtwar. “They told the DC that genuine charitable organisations suffer losses as donors are misled by fraudulent groups. The DC issued the order on the advice of these religious leaders,” Omar said, adding the move had been welcomed by the Imam of Jamia Masjid Kishtwar and other clerics in the district.Many were not persuaded. Deputy CM Surinder Choudhary decried the order, saying such a decision should not have been taken at the district level when an elected govt was in place. Tanvir Sadiq, spokesperson for Omar’s governing National Conference (NC), also debunked the “localised directive”. “I think it is interference in religious affairs,” Sadiq said.Opposition PDP joined the chorus of condemnation, with party MLA Waheed Parra arguing that charity is not a security issue and urging reconsideration of the directive. CPI(M) state secretary MY Tarigami said the order effectively “casts suspicion on the entire Muslim community”.BJP was the only one to welcome the order. J&K leader of opposition Sunil Sharma alleged that some individuals collect zakat during Ramadan and use the funds for “anti-national activities”.

'Won’t Spare A Single Infiltrator': Amit Shah’s Poll Promise In Assam, Slams Cong Over Infiltration

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday trained his guns on Congress over its years in power in Assam, blaming the party for infiltration and alleging that it had “left our borders open to infiltrators” in what he described as an “attempt to alter the demographics” of the state. He also drew a contrast with the current BJP government under chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma , praising his “work to clear lakhs of acres of land occupied by infiltrators.”Addressing a gathering in poll-bound Assam, Shah strongly criticised the Congress’s record, saying, “Assam was beset by two problems: infiltrators were usurping the rights of the Assamese… These Congress governments left our borders open to infiltrators. Infiltrators continued to enter Assam. An attempt was made to alter the demographics of Assam by snatching away the jobs of Assam's youth, the food grains of the poor, and the land of the villages. ”Shah further praised the Sarma-led government, stating, “In the second five years, our CM Himanta Biswa Sarma worked to clear lakhs of acres of land occupied by infiltrators and remove them. Now, elections are coming for the third time. Form the BJP government here once again.I promise you that we will send back every single infiltrator who entered during the Congress regime.”He also highlighted infrastructure development under the BJP, saying, “Congress ruled for years, but it did nothing for the development of Assam. What Congress could not do in fifty years, we did in ten years. In the last five years, 14 kilometres of road have been built in Assam every day… Almost hundreds of bridges were built, including four major new bridges.”Notably, CM Himanta Sarma was previously part of the Congress government in Assam. After strained relations with the party, he joined the BJP in 2015 and later became chief minister, succeeding his BJP colleague Sarbananda Sonowal Meanwhile, Shah also launched the second phase of the Vibrant Villages Programme in Assam, which will cover 1,954 border villages across 15 states and two Union Territories. The launch was held in Cachar district.Earlier in the day, the Union home minister arrived in the poll-bound state on a two-day visit to launch border infrastructure projects and address public gatherings.",Union home minister Amit Shah is on a two-day visit to poll-bound Assam.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: BJP is likely to field former DGP Jacob Thomas either in the Thrissur or Irinjalakuda assembly constituency in the upcoming assembly elections. Thomas’s candidacy is learnt to be more aligned with the interests of RSS than with the BJP leadership in the state.Thomas announced his support for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and joined BJP in 2021. He received party membership from the then party national president JP Nadda. On several occasions, the Central leadership has relied on his independent assessments of political developments and organisational matters related to the BJP's Kerala unit. However, the BJP state leadership failed to utilize his full potential, which somewhat alienated him from BJP activities in the state. He has since then gravitated more towards RSS and its ideology.He hit headlines when he joined an RSS Padasanchalan in traditional RSS attire in Kochi in Oct 2025. In response to questions, Thomas always said that RSS has no caste or religion, adding that the organization works for the society’s welfare.According to BJP sources, fielding Thomas in Thrissur or Irinjalakuda would give members of the Christian community a valid reason to vote for the BJP candidate.They believe that his public image as an anti-corruption campaigner would make him a desirable candidate for all sections of society. Supporters within the party also point to his earlier confrontations with the LDF govt and the raw deal meted out to him by political establishments as factors that may work in his favour as a candidate.At the same time, a section of leaders in the BJP state unit is doubtful about Thomas’s prospects in either constituency. According to them, Union minister Suresh Gopi was a huge let-down as Thrissur MP, and Thomas or any other BJP candidate may find it difficult to overcome that disappointment factor. The weak organisational set-up of BJP in Thrissur is also cited as a concern.They also fear that the better ties the UDF established with Christian churches may also work against BJP. Still, there is a fighting chance for the BJP candidate, they point out. Gopi won 40,457 votes in the last assembly election in the Thrissur assembly seat, though he finished in third position.The victory margin of CPI’s P Balachandran was around 3%. With BJP having increased its vote share in the subsequent Lok Sabha election, Thomas stands a chance to win, according to those who support his candidacy in Thrissur.",Thomas announced his support for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and joined BJP in 2021.

However, he stopped short of naming anyone as his ‘successor’.“The people of Tripunithura and the Congress party brought me from an ordinary man, to where I am today.

‘Embarrassed Himself’: Gaurav Gogoi Slams Assam CM Himanta Sarma Over ‘Pakistan Links’ Allegation

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Friday slammed Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, saying he is “rattled” by MP Gaurav Gogoi amid a row over alleged “Pakistan links.”She accused Sarma of attacking Gogoi and his family because he is pursuing the “politics of love.”Speaking to reporters in Guwahati, Priyanka Gandhi said politics has “two types of leaders” — those who practise positive politics and those who rely on polarisation and personal attacks.""There are two types of leaders - one, those with a positive mindset and others who believe in polarisation and attacking people. The way Gaurav ji (Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi) and his family are being targeted proves that this kind of politics is wrong. I think the people of Assam know that the other side is rattled by him; this is the reason why all this is happening. It is because he is walking on the right path, he is being attacked. ..It is like a badge of honour,” she said when asked about Sarma's repeated attacks on Gogoi over alleged Pakistan links.""Nobody should attack the family and children (of a political leader),"" Priyanka added.The remarks come amid an ongoing political storm in Assam, where CM Himanta Sarma has repeatedly alleged that Gogoi and his wife have ties to Pakistani national Ali Tauqeer Sheikh, plotting to undermine India's development.Sarma announced the probe, including evidence, has been handed to central agencies, with the SIT investigation also set for transfer.Taking a direct swipe, the Wayanad MP said that the Assam CM should ""talk about the youth and women of the state, who are looking for jobs.""""You are seeing how much corruption is taking place.

It involves systematic examination of wreckage, operational and maintenance records and laboratory testing of components where required.The crashed VSR Ventures-owned Learjet 45 was equipped with a Digital Flight Data Recorder and a Cockpit Voice Recorder.

Those who have faced no formal sanction





The latest release of Jeffrey Epstein–related documents has begun to reshape careers across politics, business, and public life by laying out, in detail, the extent of his relationships with some of the world’s most powerful figures. In Britain, Labour veteran Peter Mandelson stepped down from the House of Lords after financial links and correspondence surfaced. In the United States, former senator George Mitchell withdrew from leadership roles as records showed sustained contact over several years.Norway saw a senior diplomat resign and corruption probes open after revelations of financial ties connected to Epstein’s will. And in one of the most consequential developments, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, widely known as Prince Andrew, was arrested in 2026 on suspicion of misconduct in public office following disclosures that he may have shared official information with Epstein during his tenure as the UK’s trade envoy.Together, the files have shifted the focus from Epstein himself to the wider network of influential individuals who remained in his orbit long after his past convictions were public, turning a long-closed criminal case into an ongoing reckoning for global public life.A physician, author, and high-profile longevity expert, Attia appeared in the files through informal email exchanges that showed a friendly and sometimes crude tone of communication with Epstein.The correspondence indicated a personal relationship rather than professional interaction. After the disclosures became public, companies with which he was associated moved quickly to distance themselves, leading Attia to step down from advisory roles amid reputational scrutiny.An Emirati business executive and former chairman of one of the world’s largest logistics firms, bin Sulayem was portrayed in the documents as maintaining a close personal friendship with Epstein through regular correspondence. Although no misconduct was alleged, investor pressure escalated rapidly following the revelations, prompting his resignation to shield the company from reputational fallout.Microsoft co-founder and global philanthropist Bill Gates has not faced any investigation or institutional sanction arising from the Epstein files, but the renewed scrutiny of his past association has begun to affect his public engagements. Gates withdrew from delivering a scheduled keynote address at the AI Impact Summit 2026 in India just hours before the event. His foundation said the decision was taken after “careful consideration” to ensure that attention remained on the summit’s priorities rather than the controversy surrounding his earlier interactions with Epstein.A former Norwegian prime minister and senior European political figure, Jagland appeared in emails suggesting Epstein attempted to use his diplomatic access to arrange meetings with global leaders. The disclosures led Norwegian authorities to open corruption investigations to examine whether Epstein sought improper influence through those connections.A Norwegian diplomat who served as ambassador, Juul was drawn into scrutiny after reports indicated Epstein had left substantial funds to her and her husband, fellow diplomat Terje Rød-Larsen, in his will. The financial link triggered corruption investigations, and Juul resigned from her diplomatic post as the inquiry began.The chairman of a major international law firm, Karp appeared in the files through emails showing Epstein had hosted him at private gatherings and maintained ongoing social contact. The visibility of this relationship created reputational risk for the firm, leading Karp to step down from his leadership role.A former French cultural minister and prominent public figure, Lang became the subject of financial investigations after the documents linked him to transactions connected to Epstein. Although he denies wrongdoing, the scrutiny prompted him to resign from leadership of a major cultural institution while inquiries continue.The Slovak diplomat and former president of the UN General Assembly appeared in the files through private exchanges that showed informal and friendly communication with Epstein. While the messages contained no evidence of illegal conduct, their tone and timing raised concerns about judgment, leading Lajčák to resign from his role as national security adviser.One of Britain’s most influential political strategists and a former ambassador to the United States, Mandelson appeared in the files through financial records and correspondence suggesting a closer personal relationship with Epstein than previously acknowledged. The disclosures triggered investigations and police searches, leading Mandelson to resign from the Labour Party and step down from the House of Lords.A former US senator and internationally respected peace negotiator, Mitchell appeared repeatedly across Epstein communication logs, indicating sustained contact over several years. Though no wrongdoing was alleged, institutions bearing his name moved quickly to distance themselves, prompting Mitchell to resign from honorary leadership roles.An influential figure in the contemporary art world and academic leadership, Ross appeared in the documents through correspondence showing he maintained contact with Epstein even after the latter’s conviction. The disclosures led to his resignation from an academic leadership role due to reputational concerns.A senior humanitarian leader associated with a UN-linked foundation, Rubinstein appeared in records confirming she had visited Epstein’s private island. Although no criminal allegation was made, the timeline of the visit led to intense public scrutiny, prompting her resignation.A former White House counsel and later chief legal officer of Goldman Sachs, Ruemmler appeared in the files through emails showing friendly correspondence with Epstein and evidence that she had received gifts from him after leaving government service. She resigned from her corporate role as reputational concerns mounted.The former Duchess of York appeared in the documents through emails indicating she maintained contact with Epstein years after his conviction. Renewed scrutiny led to the closure of a charity linked to her after institutional support diminished.A film producer and co-owner of an NFL franchise, Tisch appeared in emails indicating Epstein introduced him to women and maintained communication. He remains in position but faces an ongoing review by the league.A prominent entertainment executive and head of a major talent agency, Wasserman appeared in the files through emails exchanged with Ghislaine Maxwell that revealed personal interactions and social planning. The fallout led to client departures, prompting him to sell the agency to limit further reputational damage.The former prince Andrew, the younger brother of King Charles III and formerly the UK’s trade envoy, has long been one of the most high-profile figures linked to Jeffrey Epstein. The latest Epstein document release included additional photographs and correspondence that reinforced the depth of their association, showing continued contact even after Epstein’s 2008 conviction. In February 2026, British police arrested Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor on suspicion of misconduct in public office as part of an investigation tied directly to material emerging from the Epstein files. Authorities are examining allegations that, during his tenure as trade envoy, he may have shared potentially confidential government documents or official information with Epstein. The arrest is separate from earlier sexual-assault allegations brought in a US civil lawsuit by Virginia Giuffre, which Andrew denied and settled out of court in 2022 without admitting liability. The current investigation centres instead on possible misuse of official position and breach of trust arising from his documented relationship with Epstein.A defining feature of the latest Epstein fallout is its unevenness. Many individuals named in the documents remain in their positions without investigation or legal consequence. Their involvement typically consists of correspondence, meetings, or social contact rather than evidence of criminal conduct. The documents have therefore reshaped careers not through courts of law, but through public scrutiny, demonstrating how reputational accountability now operates alongside, and often independently of, formal legal processes.","The latest release of Jeffrey Epstein–related documents has begun to reshape careers across politics, business, and public life.

Why were Trump tariffs ruled illegal by Supreme Court? Top points from what SC said in its ruling,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/why-were-trump-tariffs-ruled-illegal-by-supreme-court-top-points-from-what-sc-said-in-its-ruling/articleshow/128615083.cms,"‘US Is Screwed If…’: Trump Fears Supreme Court Ruling As Tariff Empire Faces Trillions In Losses

""The Government thus concedes, as it must, that the President enjoys no inherent authority to impose tariffs during peacetime,""

Chief Justice John Roberts

wrote in the ruling.

""And it does not defend the challenged tariffs as an exercise of the President’s warmaking powers. The United States, after all, is not at war with every nation in the world.""

Supreme Court Verdict on Trump Tariffs : Key Points

Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts said that the Constitution clearly assigns the authority to levy taxes — including tariffs — to Congress. He emphasized that the framers did not allocate any portion of the taxing power to the executive branch. Delivering the majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts emphasized that IEEPA makes no mention of tariffs or import duties.

The court ruled that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) ""does not authorize the President to impose tariffs.""

Chief Justice John Roberts clarified in the opinion that the court’s role was limited to determining whether the authority to “regulate … importation” under the IEEPA extends to the imposition of tariffs. He concluded that it does not, referencing the statutory language cited by President Donald Trump in defense of his broad tariff measures.

Roberts further explained that had Congress intended IEEPA to grant the president the specific and exceptional authority to levy tariffs, it would have done so explicitly, as it has consistently provided in other tariff-related legislation.

Referring to an earlier ruling of the Supreme Court of the United States, Roberts stated that a president must be able to identify clear authorization from Congress when asserting such sweeping tariff powers. In this instance, he wrote, that requirement had not been satisfied.

The court observed that if Congress had meant to grant the sweeping and exceptional authority to impose tariffs through the IEEPA, it would have stated so explicitly, as it has consistently done in other tariff-related laws.

The major questions doctrine is front and center: For Roberts (joined on this part by Gorsuch and Barrett), this is a classic “major questions” case: the government is claiming a “transformative” expansion of presidential authority over a core congressional function (tariffs) based on ambiguous language (“regulate … importation”). Given the economic and political stakes—multi-trillion-dollar implications and a claimed $4 trillion deficit reduction—the Court says a reasonable interpreter would expect “clear congressional authorization,” which isn’t there.

The statutory text is read narrowly: “regulate” ≠ “tax”: The majority leans heavily on ordinary meaning and statutory pattern. “Regulate” means to control or direct by rule; it’s used all over the U.S. Code and never understood to smuggle in taxing authority. When Congress wants to delegate tariff powers, it uses words like “duty,” “tariff,” “surcharge,” and explicitly caps rates, duration, and triggers. IEEPA’s silence on tariffs, juxtaposed with these other trade statutes, is treated as decisive.

In what is a big blow to US President Donald Trump, the Supreme Court has struck down his sweeping reciprocal tariffs that were imposed after the Liberation Day in April 2025. In a 6–3 ruling, the court examined duties introduced under an emergency powers statute, including the broad “reciprocal” tariffs applied to nearly all countries.The case marked the first significant element of Trump’s wide-ranging policy agenda to be directly reviewed by America’s highest court — an institution he influenced during his first term by appointing three conservative justices.The court anchored its ruling in the text of the US Constitution that outlines the division of authority among the three branches of government: “The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises.”The court was not convinced by the Trump administration’s contention that a war-like emergency justified bypassing the Constitution’s separation of powers framework.The judgment does not affect the separate, sector-focused duties that President Donald Trump introduced on imports such as steel, aluminum, and certain other products.In the decision, the court’s three liberal members aligned with three conservative justices to affirm earlier lower court rulings that found the tariffs imposed under IEEPA to be unlawful. Conservative Justices Brett Kavanaugh, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito dissented.The ruling does not bar Trump from introducing tariffs under alternative statutory authorities. Although those laws impose stricter constraints on the scope and pace of such measures, senior administration officials have indicated their intention to preserve the broader tariff structure through other legal mechanisms.President Donald Trump has relied heavily on tariffs — duties placed on imported products — as a principal instrument of both economic and foreign policy. These measures became a cornerstone of the global trade conflict he launched after starting his second term, a confrontation that strained relations with trading partners, unsettled financial markets, and heightened uncertainty across the world economy.The court’s ruling came in response to lawsuits filed by companies impacted by the tariffs, along with 12 US states — most led by Democratic governors — challenging Trump’s unprecedented decision to use the statute to impose import taxes on his own authority.Earlier in May, a federal trade court concluded that Trump had exceeded his legal authority by implementing broad-based levies and prevented most of them from being enforced. That ruling, however, was temporarily suspended while the administration pursued an appeal.","US Supreme Court struck down sweeping reciprocal tariffs that were imposed after the Liberation Day in April 2025.

Bishnoi gan member Harry Boxer





MUMBAI: Actor Ranveer Singh received multiple threat calls from Harry Boxer, a member of the Lawrence Bishnoi gang, making an extortion demand for Rs 20 crore, the FIR registered by the police on Tuesday stated.An officer said they registered the offence after getting confirmation from the Punjab and Haryana police that the voice belonged to Boxer.Police have issued a lookout circular (LOC) against Boxer. A Rajasthan native, Boxer is believed to be holed up in Canada.According to the police, the complaint was formally lodged by Singh's social media handler and manager Vijay Subramanian, founder and group CEO of collective Artist Network. Based on his statement, crime branch's south region cyber cell registered the FIR on Feb 17 against Boxer. The south region cyber cell as well the anti-extortion cell (AEC) are jointly working on the case.The complaint states that Subramanian received two to three threat calls from an international number on Feb 10. When he stopped taking the calls, the caller who identified himself as Harry Boxer left three voice notes demanding Rs 20 crore.Police said that Subramanian received multiple calls on his mobile phone from an international number beginning with +340, a country code believed to be linked to the Virgin Islands. During the calls, the caller allegedly demanded money and issued threats.The calls came a week after the Feb 1 firing on filmmaker Rohit Shetty's Juhu bungalow. The police verified the threats received from Boxer before registering the case on Singh's manager's complaint.

RAJKOT: In a chilling incident of road rage, two 17-year-old Class 12 students allegedly murdered a 33-year-old jeweller in ‘ceramic town' Morbi, enraged by the sound of his car horn — turning a joyous happy housewarming ceremony of the victim into a lifetime of grief.The police detained both minors on Friday and launched a detailed probe.On Thursday, the jeweller Jatin Adesara was returning to Morbi from Rajkot where he had gone with his wife to pick up his sister for the elaborate ‘vastu' function planned on Friday.Around 10pm, when he was driving towards his house on Shanala Road, two boys on a scooter refused to give him side.Adesara kept honking, assuming that they would move aside after some distance.Instead, the duo stopped their vehicle right in the middle of the road and started hurling expletives at him. They approached his car, grabbed him by the collar and pulled him out. One of them repeatedly stabbed him even as the other boy restrained him. Both fled from the spot on their scooter, leaving Adesara bleeding on the road with deep stab wounds in the chest and back.Police said Adesara had called his elder brother Maulik when the fight began.Maulik rushed him to Krishna Hospital where Adesara revealed the nicknames by which the boys were addressing each other. Despite doctors' efforts, Adesara couldn't survive.Officials said as the confrontation began, his wife, sister and another relative kept sitting in the car as they did not expect the dispute to end in bloodshed, police said.Adesara co-owned a jewellery shop in Soni Bazaar with Maulik. The family, which resides on Satyampan Street, was left devastated by the tragic loss of Adesara, who is a father of an 11-month-old girl.R S Patel, inspector of Morbi A division police station, said, ""Primarily, there is no other motive for the murder and it's a classic case of road rage.""Mukesh Patel, superintendent of police, Morbi, told TOI: ""Both the boys study in class 12 and one of them will turn 18 within a week. Father of one of the boys is engaged in animal husbandry and the other's father has a criminal record with cases of prohibition.","Jatin Adesara was returning to Morbi from Rajkot where he had gone with his wife to pick up his sister for the elaborate ‘vastu' function planned on Friday.

“The United States, after all, is not at war with every nation in the world,” the US Supreme Court said in its landmark judgment against Donald Trump , striking down tariffs imposed across the globe.

Why the decision matters beyond Trump







The US Supreme Court’s ruling striking down tariffs imposed under emergency powers has triggered a fundamental constitutional question: can a president --including Donald Trump -- overturn or bypass a Supreme Court decision on tariffs?The answer, rooted in the US Constitution’s separation of powers, is clear. A president cannot reverse a Supreme Court ruling. But the judgment itself explains why — and outlines the limited paths still available to the executive branch.Under Article III of the US Constitution, the Supreme Court exercises judicial power to interpret federal law and determine whether presidential actions comply with statutes and constitutional limits. In Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump , the Court held that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not authorise a president to impose tariffs, rejecting the administration’s claim of sweeping emergency authority.The Court emphasised that tariffs are fundamentally taxes -- and taxation authority belongs to Congress.“There is no exception to the major questions doctrine for emergency statutes. Nor does the fact that tariffs implicate foreign affairs render the doctrine inapplicable. The Framers gave “Congress alone” the power to impose tariffs during peacetime.” the Court wrote, reaffirming Article I’s allocation of taxing power.Once the Court interprets a statute or constitutional provision, that interpretation becomes binding law nationwide. The executive branch must comply.The Constitution divides government power among three branches:Because tariff authority derives from Congress’s taxing power, the Court ruled, ""The president has no inherent authority to impose tariffs independently during peacetime.""That means a president cannot:The Court stressed: ""There is no major questions exception to the major questions doctrine. Accordingly, the President must “point to clear congressional authorization” to justify his extraordinary assertion of the power to impose tariffs,"" which it found absent in IEEPA.Central to the ruling is separation of powers — a system designed to prevent concentration of authority in one branch.The justices warned that allowing tariff powers through vague emergency language would create unchecked presidential authority over trade policy and the broader economy.According to the judgment, Congress historically delegated tariff authority only through statutes containing explicit limits on scope, duration and procedure.The Court also relied on the “major questions doctrine,” under which courts require clear legislative approval before allowing executive action involving vast economic and political consequences.While the ruling blocks tariffs imposed under IEEPA, it does not eliminate presidential trade power entirely.The Constitution leaves several lawful options:The ruling makes clear that a president cannot:The justices noted that emergencies do not justify transferring core legislative powers to the executive without explicit language from Congress.The case can be viewed as one of the most significant separation-of-powers rulings affecting economic policy in decades.The Court concluded that accepting the administration’s argument would have allowed tariffs of unlimited amount, duration and scope based solely on a presidential emergency declaration.By rejecting that claim, the ruling reasserts congressional control over trade policy and narrows how emergency powers can be used to reshape the economy.","The US Supreme Court’s ruling striking down tariffs imposed under emergency powers has triggered a fundamental constitutional question.

Iran's response





The United States is rapidly increasing its military presence in the Middle East, with two aircraft carrier strike groups deployed near the region in a rare concentration of naval power amid tensions with Iran.At the same time, President Donald Trump is reportedly weighing a narrow Iran nuclear deal that could allow limited, “token” uranium enrichment. Pentagon officials are also presenting options that range from diplomatic measures to potentially targeting Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and his son. White House spokesperson Anna Kelly emphasized that “only President Trump knows what he may or may not decide” regarding the next steps.The world’s largest warship, the USS Gerald R Ford, has entered the Mediterranean, while the USS Abraham Lincoln operates nearby in Middle Eastern waters. The Ford passed through the Strait of Gibraltar on Friday, confirmed by verified photographs showing the vessel with the Moroccan mountain range in the background. Ship-tracking data also confirmed the passage of the USS Mahan, one of the destroyers in the Ford’s strike group, according to the BBC.The Ford briefly switched on its automatic identification system (AIS) for the first time this year at 12:30 GMT on Wednesday, transmitting its position off Morocco’s Atlantic coast until 13:18 while sailing toward the Mediterranean. A transport aircraft attached to the carrier that landed in Spain that day was tracked at about 13:00 on Thursday heading toward the area where the carrier was later spotted.The Abraham Lincoln was identified in publicly available European Sentinel-2 satellite images taken on Saturday in the Arabian Sea, around 240km off the coast of Oman and about 700km from Iran. The warship had not been seen since reportedly entering the region in January, having crossed open sea areas where satellite coverage is limited.US and Iranian officials met for a second round of talks in Switzerland earlier this week, where progress was reported to have been made. President Donald Trump said on Thursday the world will likely find out within the next 10 days whether the US will reach a deal with Iran or take military action.BBC Verify tracked 12 US ships in the Middle East. The Abraham Lincoln, a nuclear-powered Nimitz-class carrier, together with three Arleigh Burke-class destroyers forms a carrier strike group.Two additional destroyers capable of long-range missile strikes and three specialist littoral combat ships for near-shore operations are positioned at the US naval base in Bahrain naval station.Two other destroyers have been seen in the eastern Mediterranean near the Souda Bay US base, and one more in the Red Sea. AFP reported Washington currently has 13 warships in the Middle East — one aircraft carrier, nine destroyers and three littoral combat ships — and that the arrival of the Ford and its three escorting destroyers will bring the total number of US warships in the region to 17.Both carriers are operated by more than 5,600 crew and carry dozens of aircraft.In addition to aircraft aboard the carriers, the United States has sent dozens of other warplanes to European and Middle Eastern airbases, according to open-source intelligence accounts on X, flight-tracking website Flightradar24 and media reports.These include F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning stealth fighter jets, as well as F-15 and F-16 warplanes.Support aircraft deployed include KC-135 and KC-46 aerial refuelling tankers used to sustain long-range operations. Other US aircraft tracked moving to the region include E-3 Sentry command and surveillance aircraft designed to coordinate large-scale operations, C-17A heavy-lift transport aircraft used for delivering troops and cargo, Navy P-8A patrol and reconnaissance jets for long-range anti-submarine warfare, and the C-5M strategic transport aircraft, the largest in the US Air Force.The United States has also reportedly boosted land-based air defenses in the Middle East, while numerous guided-missile destroyers in the region provide air-defense capability at sea. Tens of thousands of US military personnel remain stationed on bases across the region that are potentially vulnerable to counterattack.Iran launched missiles at a US base in Qatar after Washington struck three Iranian nuclear sites in June 2025, but they were shot down by air defenses.In response to recent US military movements, Iran has carried out its own show of force. On Monday, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps launched a maritime drill in the Strait of Hormuz, located between Oman and Iran. The exercise saw IRGC Commander-in-Chief Maj Gen Mohammad Pakpour inspecting naval vessels at a harbour before missiles were launched from a ship, the IRGC-linked Tasnim News Agency reported.The arrival of the Ford adds to what has been tracked as a significant military buildup in the Middle East over recent weeks, including increased numbers of destroyers, combat ships and fighter aircraft across the region and surrounding seas.Together, the Ford and Abraham Lincoln strike groups represent a major concentration of US naval and air power in the Middle East.","The world’s largest warship, the USS Gerald R Ford, has entered the Mediterranean, while the USS Abraham Lincoln operates nearby in Middle Eastern waters.

PKG EX PRINCE ANDREW RELEASED AFTER ARREST-_2





The UK government is considering introducing legislation to remove former prince Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor from the line of royal succession, a move that would bar him from becoming king.Defence Minister Luke Pollard called the move “the right thing to do” irrespective of a police investigation, as cited by the BBC.Andrew, King Charles's brother, is currently eighth in line to the throne, despite being stripped of his titles, including “prince”, last October amid pressure over his ties to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.On Thursday evening, Andrew was released under investigation about 11 hours after his arrest on suspicion of misconduct in public office. He has consistently denied any wrongdoing.The arrest followed the release of millions of pages of documents from a US investigation into Epstein, who died in prison in 2019. Emails cited in media reports and released by the US Justice Department indicate correspondence between Epstein and Andrew’s aide, David Stern.The messages suggest the former royal may have shared reports and investment opportunities while serving as the UK’s special representative for trade and investment from 2001 to 2011.Pollard confirmed the government had “absolutely” been working with Buckingham Palace on plans to stop the former prince from “potentially being a heartbeat away from the throne,"" as cited by the BBC.He said the move was “something that I hope will enjoy cross-party support, but its right that that is something that only happens when the police investigation concludes”.The proposal would require an Act of Parliament, which would need approval from both the House of Commons and the House of Lords before taking effect with royal assent from King Charles III.It would also need the backing of the 14 Commonwealth realms where Charles III is head of state, including Canada, Australia, Jamaica and New Zealand.Parliament last changed the line of succession in 2013, when the Succession to the Crown Act removed restrictions on individuals who had married a Catholic.The last time a person was removed from the line of succession by legislation was in 1936, when Edward VIII and his descendants were excluded following his abdication.",The UK government is considering introducing legislation to remove former prince Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor from the line of royal succession.

Why the ruling matters



Bottom line







In a landmark decision that reshaped the limits of presidential power in the United States, the Supreme Court on February 20, 2026 struck down Donald Trump’s sweeping global tariffs in a 6–3 ruling. The verdict was historic not merely because it invalidated one of Trump’s most aggressive economic policies, but because two justices he personally appointed joined the majority against him. The case quickly became a defining moment in the ongoing constitutional debate over how far a US president can go in wielding economic authority without Congress.At the heart of the case was whether Trump could use emergency powers under a national-security law to impose broad tariffs on imports. The Supreme Court ruled that the statute did not authorise such sweeping action. It held that tariffs are essentially a form of taxation, and under the Constitution, the power to impose taxes rests with Congress.Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts framed the case as a fundamental separation-of-powers question. He warned that allowing a president to impose tariffs without clear legislative approval would effectively give the executive branch unlimited authority to reshape the economy.Two of Trump’s own nominees, Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett, joined the majority, delivering a striking institutional rebuke.Gorsuch, appointed in 2017, has long championed strict constitutional limits on executive power. In this case, he emphasised that major economic actions require explicit congressional authorisation and cannot rest on vague statutory language. His opinion reflected a consistent judicial philosophy that prioritises constitutional structure over political alignment.Barrett, Trump’s 2020 appointee, also sided with the majority. She agreed that Congress must clearly delegate authority before a president can take decisions with vast economic consequences. Her vote was particularly significant because she is widely regarded as one of the court’s most conservative members.The ruling exposed a deep split within the court’s conservative bloc. Chief Justice Roberts, though appointed by a Republican president, joined Gorsuch and Barrett in striking down the tariffs, creating a three-member conservative majority against Trump.On the other side, conservatives Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Brett Kavanaugh dissented. They argued that Congress had already delegated broad authority to presidents to regulate foreign commerce and that Trump’s tariffs fell within that tradition. Their dissent reflected a longstanding judicial approach that favours strong executive power, especially in matters of national security and foreign policy.All three liberal justices voted with the majority, making the final alignment a rare cross-ideological coalition driven more by constitutional interpretation than partisan ideology.The ruling triggered a furious response from Trump, who publicly criticised the justices who sided against him, including his own nominees. Within hours, he signalled plans to pursue new tariffs under alternative legal authorities, underscoring that the political battle over trade powers is far from settled.Beyond trade policy, the decision is widely seen as one of the most consequential limits placed on presidential authority in decades. It reinforced the constitutional principle that economic taxation powers remain firmly with Congress, even during national emergencies.The judgment also highlighted a broader philosophical divide within the conservative legal movement over how far executive power should extend.The Supreme Court’s tariff ruling was not simply a legal setback for Donald Trump. It was a defining constitutional moment that reaffirmed congressional authority over taxation and revealed that even a president’s own appointees may ultimately side with institutional limits over political loyalty.","The Supreme Court on February 20, 2026 struck down Donald Trump’s sweeping global tariffs in a 6–3 ruling.

‘US Is Screwed If…’: Trump Fears Supreme Court Ruling As Tariff Empire Faces Trillions In Losses





A trio of conservative justices Friday warned that the court had overstepped its bounds in its decision to block President Donald Trump's emergency tariffs, arguing that the president should be able to impose tariffs under his power to conduct foreign affairs.In a 63-page dissent, written by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, the dissenters also raised concerns that the decision would lead to chaos, at least in the short term as importers who have already paid the tariffs seek refunds.""The United States may be required to refund billions of dollars to importers who paid the IEEPA tariffs, even though some importers may have already passed on costs to consumers or others,"" Kavanaugh wrote, referring to an acronym for the 1970s emergency statute Trump invoked to impose tariffs. He noted discussion at oral arguments about how such a refund process was likely to be a ""mess.""He also noted that the administration had used the leverage of tariffs to enter into key trading deals with other nations. Trump, he wrote, ""helped facilitate trade deals worth trillions of dollars -- including with foreign nations from China to the United Kingdom to Japan, and more.""The court's ruling ""could generate uncertainty regarding those trade arrangements,"" he wrote.Even as Kavanaugh warned of dire consequences from the court's decision, he sounded optimistic about the ability of Trump to continue imposing tariffs.Kavanaugh wrote that although he ""firmly"" disagreed with the outcome, ""the decision might not substantially constrain a President's ability to order tariffs going forward.""He laid out several potential pathways for the president to impose tariffs, adding that these other federal statutes ""might justify most (if not all) of the tariffs at issue in this case."" He added, however, that those statutes might require additional steps that the emergency law Trump has so far cited does not.He listed specific sections of several federal laws, including the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, the Trade Act of 1974 and the Tariff Act of 1930, writing that the majority had concluded that ""the president checked the wrong statutory box"" by relying on the emergency law.","Kavanaugh, Thomas and Alito wrote a 63-page dissent to the court's decision.

California’s role in challenging Trump tariffs





In a major setback to President Donald Trump’s trade policy, the US Supreme Court, in a 6-3 ruling, struck down sweeping global tariffs imposed under emergency powers, holding that the president exceeded his legal authority by bypassing Congress.In its majority opinion, the court ruled that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president unilateral authority to impose broad import tariffs, emphasizing that the Constitution clearly vests taxing powers, including tariffs, with Congress.Reacting to the verdict, California Governor Gavin Newsom called for immediate refunds to American families and businesses for what he described as unlawfully collected tariffs.“Time to pay the piper. These tariffs were nothing more than an illegal cash grab that drove up prices and hurt working families. Every dollar unlawfully taken must be refunded immediately — with interest,” Newsom wrote on X.California played a central role in the legal battle, becoming the first state to challenge the tariffs in court in April 2025. The state argued that Trump’s use of emergency powers to impose sweeping tariffs without congressional approval was unlawful and economically damaging.State officials warned the measures had a disproportionate impact on California’s vast agricultural sector, exporters, and small businesses, given its position as the largest state economy in the US.According to estimates from Yale University’s Budget Lab and federal customs data, more than USD 130 billion to USD 142 billion was collected under the tariffs in 2025 alone. Analysts said the costs were largely passed on to consumers through higher prices, with the average American household losing an estimated USD 1,751 over the year.The Supreme Court’s decision marked a significant victory for states, businesses, and trade groups that had challenged the tariffs, arguing they disrupted global trade relationships and imposed heavy financial burdens domestically.Trump, however, criticised the ruling, calling it “deeply disappointing” and asserting that his administration has “very powerful alternatives” to continue protecting US trade interests. He also indicated plans to pursue other legal avenues to maintain tariffs under different statutory authorities.","The US Supreme Court, in a 6-3 ruling, struck down sweeping global tariffs imposed under emergency powers.

California Governor Gavin Newsom called for immediate refunds to American families and businesses for what he described as unlawfully collected tariffs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128623841,imgsize-18816,width-400,resizemode-4/128623841.jpg"

Texas GOP senator John Cornyn was trolled after he shared an NYT podcast in which Indian-origin scholar Amitav Acharya said the superpower in waiting is India, not the US or China. Cornyn posted the NYT opinion piece by the headline that said 'Welcome to the Indian Century' but he was called a traitor for the post, and MAGA gave a call not to vote for him. The post was later deleted.""Welcome to the Indian Century. And people wonder why Dallas looks like New Delhi. You cannot call yourself a patriot and vote for Cornyn. If you’re a Texan, send him packing March 3rd,"" one wrote.""I can’t imagine a politician of any other country promoting another country. Your policies have contributed to America’s decline. You should be ashamed of yourself,"" another wrote.""Cornyn does a great job of representing Ukraine, China & India,"" a third user wrote.Acharya, in the podcast, talked about the changing equation of the world order and how India is a power to watch out for.On the question of H-1B and 'ethnic mafia', Acharya said it is true that a huge number of Indians come to the US on H-1B visa program, but they are all qualified.""I can tell you that the Indian diaspora that gets H-1 B visas are not taking any jobs from the kind of support base of President Trump. I think these are completely different levels of skill,"" Acharya said. This was also seen as an arrogant comment as MAGA interpreted it as a statement on H-1B visa holders' supremacy over Americans.The row took place at a time when Texas had been seeing a strong anti-India movement with Governor Greg Abbott freezing H-1B hiring in state agencies and universities and Attorney General Ken Paxton announcing a probe into three H-1B firms. The meetings of local city councils are regularly torn over the issue of 'Indian takeover'.The last two city council meetings of Frisco saw major protests against Indians.","Texas GOP senator John Cornyn was trolled after he shared an NYT podcast.
