Travis Kelce has sparked controversy among Taylor Swift fans after his reaction to Donald Trump's election

Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce has drawn ire from some of Taylor Swift 's fans for stating that an appearance by Donald Trump at the Super Bowl would be an honor to him, as Trump has in the past criticized Taylor Swift. At a news conference on February 5, Kelce was generally upbeat over the White House's announcement that Trump will become the first sitting president to attend the Super Bowl.Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has taken heat from fans of Taylor Swift after speaking to his reaction when Donald Trump decided to attend the Super Bowl with no connection to football.At a media day interview on Wednesday, Kelce was asked whether he was offended by Donald Trump's decision to attend Sunday's championship game.""It's a great honor"" Kelce replied. ""I think, you know, no matter who the president is, I know I'm excited because it's the biggest game of my life, you know, and having the president there, you know, it's the best country in the world. So, that'd be pretty cool.” Kelce's neutral comments were met with resentment from Swifties due to Trump's escalating feud with the singer, which escalated last year. The president wrote, ""I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT"" on Truth Social.Taylor Swift's fan base, Swifties, expressed disappointment and anger over Kelce's comments, with some calling for Swift to end her relationship with him. ""@eagles all the way on Sunday. Even more love for them now that orange lunatic will be there. Travis Kelce is an orange lover. No respect left for him. How can Swift stay with him? Every Trump lover is a maggot in my books,"" fan wrote.Another added, ""Disappointed bc in 2018 The Eagles didn't make their players go and because so many declined, Trump then uninvited the team. Considering Kelce has spoken about social justice as a white man, this is disappointing."" ""Friendly reminder that Taylor Swift said 'f**k that, I don't care' when Trump said he'd come after her. I'm sorry, but Travis Kelce could have said the same thing,"" a third noted.Donald Trump and Taylor Swift have been bickering back and forth over the years: Swift publicly endorses Democratic candidates in 2018, followed by Trump lambasting her at the time; last year saw Trump attack her amid rumors over her potential clout in 2024.Also Read: Taylor Swift bringing Swifties into the NFL, as the league reports that women constitute nearly half of the audience Swift, who followed Kelce to the home games of his team, the Chiefs, during the 2024-25 NFL season, will likely attend the final Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans as the Chiefs seek to make history by winning a record third game in a row against the Philadelphia Eagles. She comes just four days before the date of the final match.","Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce has drawn ire from some of Taylor Swift's fans for stating that an appearance by Donald Trump at the Super Bowl would be an honor to him.

Michael Jordan’s Son Marcus Fights Back: Pleads NOT GUILTY in Shocking DUI Case



ALSO READ:

Marcus Jordan, the son of basketball legend Michael Jordan , has been making headlines lately, but not for his slam dunks. The 34-year-old entrepreneur, known for his ventures in the sneaker and hospitality industries, found himself in a sticky situation earlier this week after a night out in Florida.Following his arrest, Marcus entered a not-guilty plea on Friday, a move that signals a potential legal battle ahead.The incident unfolded in the early hours of Tuesday morning in Florida when Jordan, driving his Lamborghini SUV, became stuck on train tracks. Arriving officers allegedly detected signs of intoxication, leading to his arrest.Let's rewind. Marcus, driving his flashy Lamborghini SUV, apparently took a wrong turn, a very wrong turn, landing his vehicle firmly stuck on train tracks. Talk about a night out gone sideways! When police arrived, they noticed more than just a navigational mishap. Allegations of driving under the influence, cocaine possession, and even a bit of resistance against the officers soon followed.Bodycam footage released by TMZ Sports painted a picture of a less-than-cooperative Marcus, who, let's just say, wasn't shy about mentioning his famous father. ""I'm Marcus Jordan. I'm Michael Jordan's son. I'm not doing anything wrong,"" he reportedly declared to the officers. While the ""Michael Jordan's son"" card might work on the basketball court, it didn't seem to impress the law enforcement officials on this occasion.Marcus, while living in the shadow of his legendary father, has carved his own path. He's a successful entrepreneur, known for his ventures in the sneaker and hospitality industries. His Trophy Room sneaker boutique , a haven for sneakerheads, has become a destination for collectors worldwide. However, this recent incident throws a spotlight on the challenges faced by those who live under the intense scrutiny that comes with being a ""celebrity offspring."" While Marcus has built a successful career in his own right, the weight of his father's legacy inevitably casts a long shadow.As Marcus navigates the legal proceedings, one thing is certain: this incident will likely have a lasting impact on his public image. The question now is, how will he navigate this challenging period and continue to build his own legacy, independent of his father's towering achievements?","Marcus Jordan, the son of basketball legend Michael Jordan, has been making headlines lately.

Vladimir Putin: 'He wants to see people stop dying': Donald Trump after call with Russian president Putin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/he-wants-to-see-people-stop-dying-trump-after-call-with-russian-president-putin/articleshow/118081127.cms,"Trump claims Ukraine war 'never would have happened' under him



Trump says he 'won't bomb' Iran



US President Donald Trump on Friday revealed he spoke with Russian leader Vladimir Putin on a phone call in an effort to negotiate an end to the Ukraine war.In an exclusive interview with The New York Post aboard Air Force One, Trump declined to say how many times the two leaders had spoken but insisted that Putin “does care” about the lives lost in the conflict.“He wants to see people stop dying,” Trump said.“All those dead people. Young, young, beautiful people. They’re like your kids, two million of them – and for no reason.”The war began in February 2022 when Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, citing security concerns over Ukraine’s growing ties with NATO and the West.The war in Ukraine, now in its third year, “never would have happened” if he had been in office in 2022, Trump asserted. He said he has a concrete plan to bring it to an end and emphasised his past relationship with Putin.“I always had a good relationship with Putin,” he said, contrasting it with his predecessor, former President Joe Biden . “Biden was an embarrassment to our nation. A complete embarrassment.”Determined to push forward with negotiations, Trump turned to national security advisor Mike Waltz while on Air Force One and said: “Let’s get these meetings going. They want to meet. Every day people are dying. Young handsome soldiers are being killed. Young men, like my sons. On both sides. All over the battlefield.”Trump has proposed a $500 million deal with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, offering security guarantees in exchange for access to Ukraine’s rare-earth minerals and gas. US Vice President JD Vance is set to meet Zelensky at the Munich security conference next week.Trump also spoke about tensions with Iran, saying he preferred negotiations over military action.“I would like a deal done with Iran on non-nuclear. I would prefer that to bombing the hell out of it… They don’t want to die. Nobody wants to die,” he told The Post.He suggested a deal could stop Israel from striking Iran but did not say what he might offer in return.“In a way, I don’t like telling you what I’m going to tell them. You know, it’s not nice,” Trump said. “I could tell what I have to tell them, and I hope they decide that they’re not going to do what they’re currently thinking of doing. And I think they’ll really be happy.”When asked for details, he replied, “I can’t say that because it’s too nasty. I won’t bomb them.”Instead, he insisted on negotiations, saying, “I’d tell them I’d make a deal.”Recently, Trump stated that he has instructed his advisers to respond forcefully if Iran assassinates him.""If they did that, they would be obliterated,"" he said. ""I've left instructions—if they do it, they get obliterated. There won’t be anything left.""","US President Donald Trump spoke with Russian leader Vladimir Putin on a phone call in an effort to negotiate an end to the Ukraine war.

The Prodigal Protégé



The Enforcer Becomes a Threat



The Betrayal and the Break



Not the only one



The Reckoning



""Just as the wicked Dushasana, born of our enemy, dragged me into the court and spoke cruel words to me,And just as he tried to forcibly remove my garment,For this, I take a solemn vow—I shall wash my hair in his very blood!""On the day the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) teetered on the brink of political collapse, Swati Maliwal posted a cryptic yet unmistakable image on X (formerly Twitter): a painting of Draupadi’s—the infamous disrobing scene from the Mahabharata.The symbolism was immediate and resounding. Draupadi, humiliated and betrayed, had vowed revenge, a fire that ultimately led to the annihilation of the Kauravas in Kurukshetra. Maliwal’s message was no different—she was wronged, she was abandoned, and she would not forgive.Once Arvind Kejriwal ’s most trusted ally, Maliwal had transformed into his most vocal critic. Her reference to Draupadi was not just about personal betrayal; it was about the systemic collapse within AAP, where loyalty was disposable and dissent was unforgivable.Swati Maliwal was no ordinary party member—she was family. As a trusted confidante of Kejriwal and the chairperson of the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) since 2015, she wielded her authority with relentless aggression. She was AAP’s warrior, fighting against crime, corruption, and injustice, all while reinforcing the party’s image as a crusader for the people. She wasn’t just a loyalist—she was one of the architects of AAP’s rise. The firebrand who took on the establishment now finds herself taking on the very party she once built.Maliwal’s tenure at DCW was defined by high-profile battles, taking on powerful figures and demanding justice for women. She was the kind of fighter Kejriwal needed—until she became too powerful.As she began asserting her independence, her proximity to Kejriwal started to fray. The first crack appeared when she was accused of corruption in DCW recruitments in 2016. Though the allegations led nowhere, AAP’s silence was telling—her shield within the party had started to erode.But the final break came in May 2024, when she accused Bibhav Kumar, Kejriwal’s personal secretary, of physically assaulting her at the Chief Minister’s residence. Instead of standing by her, AAP turned its back. Kejriwal, whom she had defended so many times, refused to even acknowledge her suffering. Maliwal was left alone to fight her battle.Maliwal expressed deep disappointment with Kejriwal, stating that despite her long-standing loyalty to AAP, he did not support her or intervene when she was allegedly assaulted in his drawing room. She claimed that after filing a complaint, the party used its resources against her, maligning her character and isolating her.Maliwal criticized Kejriwal and AAP leaders for publicly defending Kumar, especially after his arrest. She noted that Kumar continued to accompany Kejriwal on campaign trips until he was taken into custody. Despite the backlash, Maliwal remains confident in the judiciary and vowed to fight her case alone.As the months passed, Maliwal saw the party she once served become unrecognizable. AAP, once the champion of transparency and democracy, had become a closed fortress, where questioning Kejriwal meant exile.In September 2024, the breaking point arrived when AAP named Atishi as Kejriwal’s successor. Maliwal lashed out, calling Atishi a ""dummy CM"" and exposing what she saw as a puppet regime.She was no longer just an outcast—she was a threat. AAP, instead of addressing her accusations, tried to erase her.Maliwal’s downfall was not an isolated case; AAP has a well-documented pattern of using and discarding its most loyal members. Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan were expelled for questioning Kejriwal’s authoritarian grip, while Kapil Mishra was ousted after accusing AAP of corruption. Alka Lamba was marginalized for asserting independence, and Kumar Vishwas was removed for questioning Kejriwal’s alliances. Even Ankit Lal and Ashish Khetan, the digital warriors of AAP’s revolution, were later pushed aside.Maliwal refused to fade into the shadows. She took her fight public, denouncing AAP’s power structure, refusing to resign despite pressure. ""AAP does not belong to just a few people,"" she declared—a direct challenge to Kejriwal’s iron grip. For Kejriwal, she had become a bete noire, just like Draupadi had been for the Kauravas. And just like Draupadi, she refused to be silent. As Draupadi had vowed to wash her hair in Dushasana’s blood, Maliwal had vowed to expose the betrayal of AAP. And on the day of AAP’s greatest downfall, she kept her promise—proverbially. Kejriwal lost.","Swati Maliwal was the chairperson of the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) since 2015.

President Donald Trump is not interested in sending Prince Harry out of the country, pursuing his visa case because he thinks the ex-royal already has a lot of problems with his wife Meghan Markle. Trump did not like Harry and Meghan's exit from the royal family as Trump's allegiance lies with the late Queen who Trump said liked him.In an interview with the New York Post, Donald Trump said he would not pursue the case against Prince Harry.“I don’t want to do that,” he said. “I’ll leave him alone. He’s got enough problems with his wife. She’s terrible.”After stepping down from their royal duties, Harry and Meghan relocated to Los Angeles in 2020. After the release of Harry's memoir 'Spare' released where he admitted to having taken drugs like cocaine, cannabis and psychedelics in the past, questions were raised as to whether he mentioned this in his visa application or if he lied in his visa application because he should have been disqualified from getting a US visa.Heritage Foundation sued the Department of Homeland Security forcing to release Prince Harry's visa records. Harry won the case as the judge ruled that his visa records won't be released but it was apprehended that Donald Trump would pursue the case.Meghan Markle does not like President Trump and the feeling is mutual as Trump also, in pas, spoke negatively about Meghan. In 2022, Trump said he thinks Harry is ""whipped"". ""I'm not a fan of Meghan, I'm not a fan, and I wasn't right from the beginning. I think poor Harry is being led around by his nose,"" Trump said at that time.Rumors were rife that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle would end their marriage though later it was said that they would choose professional separation instead implying that they would concentrate on their individual work and make rare joint appearances though the California wildfires saw them together visiting relief centers.",Donald Trump said he won't deport Prince Harry as he believed Harry already has a lot of problems because of Meghan Markle.

A Controversy That Won’t Die

Poll Do You Think Politicians Should Speak Out More Against Hate Crimes? No, It’s a Complex Issue Yes, Silence Encourages Hate

JD Vance’s Response: Gaslighting or Genuine Belief?

The Hypocrisy: Why Wasn’t

Ramaswamy Given the Same Grace?

The Big Balls Moment: Musk’s Flippant Justification

When Black NFL players kneeled for the anthem, MAGA figures demanded permanent bans.

When liberal figures were “canceled” for offensive remarks, MAGA called for boycotts and firings.

When an Indian-American MAGA figure was removed, there was silence.

""Christ is King, not some stinky Indian idol.""

""Will there be a cow in the White House soon?""

The Takeaway: Who Gets to Be Forgiven?

Is there any true place for them in MAGA?

Are they only valued as token figures when convenient?

Would their loyalty ever be reciprocated?

The phrase “Normalize Indian Hate” was posted by Marko Elez, a former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employee whose racist social media history resurfaced last week. The revelation sparked a massive backlash, leading to Elez’s resignation. However, Elon Musk, with backing from Vice President JD Vance , reinstated Elez after a public poll on X.Vance’s defense of Elez—despite the blatant racism—has ignited outrage, particularly among Indian-Americans. Critics point to the hypocrisy in how Elez is treated compared to Vivek Ramaswamy , the Indian-American MAGA figure who was pushed out of DOGE without fanfare or second chances.This controversy highlights a deeper, uncomfortable truth. While MAGA claims to be an inclusive, meritocratic movement, it still harbors deep-seated biases against Indian-Americans—whether they are outsiders criticizing the right or insiders trying to fit in.Vance took to X (formerly Twitter) to dismiss concerns over Elez’s racist statements. Instead of addressing why he supported the return of someone who publicly advocated hate against Indians , he attacked critics for engaging in “emotional blackmail.”""For the sake of both of our kids? Grow up,"" Vance wrote. ""Racist trolls on the internet, while offensive, don’t threaten my kids. You know what does? A culture that denies grace to people who make mistakes. A culture that encourages Congressmen to act like whiny children.""Vance framed the backlash as part of a cancel culture overreach, ignoring the fact that Elez’s post explicitly targeted Indian-Americans—a group that includes his own wife and children.His dismissive stance infuriated social media users, who called him out for failing to defend his own family.Congressman Ro Khanna responded, saying, ""Are you going to tell him to apologize for saying ‘Normalize Indian hate’ before this rehire? Just asking for the sake of both of our kids.""Journalist Wajahat Ali added, ""Your wife is Indian American. Your kids are Indian American. Elez said he wants to ‘normalize Indian hate.’ Have some pride, man. Have some dignity. For your family's sake, you pathetic Reek.""Another user, Divya, criticized Vance’s privilege, stating, ""Easy for JD Vance to say this when his kids are covered by 24/7 security. What about regular Indian kids who have been rendered vulnerable because of the normalization of online hatred against Indians?""A well-known activist account, ind_us_immigrnt, pointed out the hypocrisy: ""Say ‘Normalize hate against White people’ and see how the MAGA clowns react.""While Elon Musk and JD Vance rallied to defend Elez, Vivek Ramaswamy—once considered MAGA’s rising star—was swiftly removed from his role in DOGE. Elez gets a poll, a second chance, and full public backing. Ramaswamy gets silence and a quiet exit.This double standard has infuriated Indian-American conservatives, many of whom now feel betrayed by a movement they once supported. The key question remains: Why is a white staffer, who openly promoted racism, given a second chance while an Indian-American leader is pushed aside?Harshil, an Indian-American commentator, pointed out, ""While Vivek Ramaswamy was deselected for DOGE, Elez has the backing of Vance for saying ‘Normalize Indian Hate.’ Indian-Americans, this is straight to your face. No matter how much you succeed, you will always be a second-class citizen.""Musk defended Elez’s return by citing forgiveness, conducting a poll on X in which 78 percent of users voted to reinstate him.Shortly after the results, Musk tweeted, ""He will be brought back. To err is human, to forgive divine.""Trump also chimed in, telling reporters, ""I’m with the Vice President.""However, this narrative of forgiveness crumbles when contrasted with MAGA’s past actions.The flippancy of how this issue was handled was best captured by David Sacks, who mocked the situation with this exchange:""Sir, the Pentagon has failed another audit.""""Send in Big Balls.""This level of casual arrogance over racism against Indian-Americans reinforces a harsh truth. Certain groups will always be prioritized within MAGA, while others remain expendable.The ‘Pagan Problem’: MAGA’s Uneasy Relationship With Indian-AmericansIndian-Americans like Usha Vance, Vivek Ramaswamy , and Sriram Krishnan have been prominent in MAGA’s political and business circles. Yet, their presence is often met with hostility from MAGA’s nativist and evangelical factions.An e arlier TOI report captured this underlying racism , highlighting online attacks against Usha Vance.Despite these overt attacks, MAGA leaders—including JD Vance himself—have largely ignored or downplayed the bigotry coming from within their own base. The underlying message is clear. Indian-Americans may be allowed in MAGA circles, but they will never be truly embraced.This controversy exposes the inherent contradictions within MAGA’s stance on race, meritocracy, and inclusion. If you are a white conservative who posts racist remarks, you get a poll, a second chance, and the full backing of Trump, Vance, and Musk. If you are an Indian-American conservative, you are disposable. The fallout from Marko Elez’s reinstatement and JD Vance’s dismissive response has left many Indian-Americans wondering:For now, Vance, Musk, and Trump have made their priorities clear. And for Indian-Americans watching from the sidelines, the lesson is stark. MAGA’s loyalty is conditional. And it does not extend to you.","The phrase “Normalize Indian Hate” was posted by Marko Elez, a former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employee whose racist social media history resurfaced last week. The revelation sparked a massive backlash, leading to Elez’s resignation.

Who is Marko Elez? What is the controversy?



JD Vance vs Ro Khanna over India-hate



Did Ro Khanna blackmail JD Vance?



President Donald Trump was asked about the controversial exit of Marko Elez from Elon Musk 's Department of Government Efficiency over his past social media posts in one of which he called himself 'racist' and also called for normalizing India hate. Trump said he was not aware of it but if Vice President JD Vance is in favor of rehiring the person, he is with the VP.""Well I don't know about that particular thing but if the Vice President said so..did you say that? (turning to JD), I'm with the VP,"" Trump said.Marko Elez is a 25-year-old lieutenant of Elon Musk who apparently resigned from DOGE, the Wall Street Journal reported. WSJ reported that Elez made some problematic posts on social media through a pseudonym account which was closed in December probably when he started to work for DOGE but many of those White supremacist posts were archived. WSJ said when they contacted White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt for a comment on Elez's past posts, Leavitt said Elez resigned from DOGE.His past posts included: “Just for the record, I was racist before it was cool.”; “You could not pay me to marry outside of my ethnicity. Normalize Indian hate"" etc.Elon Musk ran a poll on X on whether to rehire him and the maximum votes were in favor of rehiring him. Even JD Vance said Elez should not be victimized for his past social media activities which became another major controversy -- as Vance is married to Indian-origin Usha Vance and he did not call out the India hate.JD Vance said he ""obviously"" disagrees with some of Elez's posts but he also thinks that past social media activity should not ruin Elez's life. Indian-origin Democrat leader Ro Khanna took offence to Vance's stand and asked him whether Vance would seek an apology from Elez for his ""normalize Indian hate"" statement. ""Just asking for the sake of both of our kids,"" Ro Khanna wrote.""For the sake of both of our kids? Grow up,"" JD Vance said. ""Racist trolls on the internet, while offensive, don't threaten my kids. You know what does? A culture that denies grace to people who make mistakes. A culture that encourages congressmen to act like whiny children.""JD Vance called Ro Khanna's statement emotional blackmail. ""I don't worry about my kids making mistakes, or developing views they later regret. I don't even worry that much about trolls on the internet. You know what I do worry about, Ro? That they'll grow up to be a US Congressmen who engages in emotional blackmail over a kid's social media posts. You disgust me,"" Vance said.","Marko Elez is a 25-year-old lieutenant of Elon Musk who apparently resigned from DOGE.

"In 2024, US seized 19kg of fentanyl from Canada border; 9,600kg from Mexico",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/in-2024-us-seized-19kg-of-fentanyl-from-canada-border-9600kg-from-mexico/articleshow/118080334.cms,"TORONTO: Canada's last-minute reprieve from crushing US tariffs came after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau unveiled a series of measures aimed at controlling the trafficking of fentanyl, a key reason President Donald Trump has cited for wanting to impose levies.Fentanyl has flooded North America's drug supply over the last decade, killing tens of thousands in Canada and the United States, and generating enormous profits for criminal organisations using basic chemistry skills, improvised equipment and home laboratories to produce millions of doses.(Fentanyl is synthetic, means it can be made easily and cheaply in a lab, and is about 50 to 100 times stronger than many prescription opioids.)Trump has repeatedly talked about fentanyl as a major public health threat to Americans and holds Mexico and Canada responsible for allowing the drug to enter the US. But last year, less than 1% of the fentanyl arriving in the US came from Canada.The number of organised crime groups making fentanyl in Canada keeps growing, and Canadian officials have uncovered links between Mexican drug cartels and some domestic crime groups involved in the drug's production.In the last six years, Canadian police have dismantled 47 fentanyl labs, including the largest ever last year in British Columbia, govt officials said. That lab had enough material to produce 96 million opioid doses.Last year, about 19kg of fentanyl was intercepted at the Canada-US border, compared with almost 9,600kg at the border with Mexico, where cartels mass-produce the drug, according to US Customs and Border Protection. One gram of powder fentanyl can fetch up to 240 Canadian dollars ($170) on the street, and pills can go for up to CA$40 ($28) each, according to Canadian police.Trump has said fentanyl seized at the northern border could kill 9.5 million Americans, but health experts have stayed away from defining a lethal dose of any opioid.Canadian fentanyl that arrives in the US tends to be sold on the dark web and shipped through the mail, Breton said. The issue of drug shipments in mailed packages focuses primarily on China.A trade rule known as de minimis allows companies to ship packages from China worth less than $800 without paying duties, taxes and fees, and their contents are subject to fewer inspections. Trump signed an executive order Saturday that removed the trade exemptions on those types of packages from China and Hong Kong.Canada's main drug export into the United States is MDMA, or ecstasy, according to a White House report in 2022 laying out the northern border counternarcotics strategy. In response to Trump's tariff threats, Canada said it would appoint a new ""fentanyl czar"" to oversee the country's efforts at the border.","Last year, less than 1% of the fentanyl arriving in the US came from Canada.

Investigation underway

Remains of all 10 recovered in Alaska plane crash : All you need to knowAuthorities have recovered the remains of all 10 victims from the fatal plane crash that occurred in western Alaska. The Nome volunteer fire department confirmed the recovery efforts on Saturday, racing against an approaching winter storm to retrieve the bodies from the icy Bering Sea.The crash involved a Bering Air single-engine turboprop plane travelling from Unalakleet to Nome.The aircraft disappeared Thursday afternoon and was discovered the following day, with all nine passengers and the pilot deceased.The tragedy marks one of the deadliest aviation incidents in Alaska in the past 25 years.The wreckage was found on a drifting ice floe moving approximately five miles per day, posing difficulties for rescue teams, according to National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Chair Jennifer Homendy.“Please know that we'll work diligently to determine how this happened with the ultimate goal of improving safety in Alaska and across the United States,” Homendy said during a press conference.A Black Hawk helicopter was deployed to assist with the recovery of the wreckage once the victims were removed. The National Weather Service had warned of an impending winter storm with snow and winds reaching up to 45 mph, further complicating recovery operations.Among those who perished were Rhone Baumgartner and Kameron Hartvigson, who had travelled to Unalakleet for work on a heat recovery system vital to the local water plant, as reported by the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium. “These two members of our team lost their lives serving others,” said David Beveridge, vice president of environmental health & engineering for the organization.The names of the other victims have not yet been released, but all ten individuals on board were adults. The flight was a routine commuter trip, confirmed Lt Ben Endres of the Alaska State Troopers.Radar data from the US Civil Air Patrol indicated that around 3:18 pm (local time) on Thursday, the aircraft experienced a sudden and rapid loss of altitude and speed. The exact cause remains unknown.Coast Guard Lt Cmdr Benjamin McIntyre-Coble stated that no distress signals were received from the aircraft. Normally, an emergency locating transmitter would signal authorities if exposed to seawater, but no such alerts were triggered.The NTSB has sent a team of investigators from multiple states to determine the cause of the crash.The crash has deeply affected the Nome community .As per the news agency AP, Mayor John Handeland expressed his grief, saying, “Nome is a strong community, and in challenging times, we come together and support each other. I expect the outpouring of support to continue in the coming days as we all work to recover from this tragic incident.”US Senator Lisa Murkowski also acknowledged the difficulty of the loss, stating, “It’s hard to accept the reality of our loss.”Bering Air, which operates flights across western Alaska, shared its condolences, “Our hearts are heavy with grief as we process this heartbreaking news. At this time, our thoughts are with the families and loved ones of those affected by this tragedy.”The company has set up a support line for relatives of those on board.With many Alaskan communities lacking road access, air travel is a lifeline for residents. Small planes are commonly used for commuting, cargo transport and even school sports travel.This incident follows two other major US aviation mishaps in the past eight days, a collision between a commercial jetliner and an Army helicopter near Washington, DC, that killed 67 people on January 29 and a medical transport plane crash in Philadelphia on January 31, which claimed seven lives.","The crash involved a Bering Air single-engine turboprop plane travelling from Unalakleet to Nome.

Donald Trumpo Harry Meghan: Did Donald Trump confirm Harry-Meghan divorce rumors? Here's what happened,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-donald-trump-confirm-harry-meghan-divorce-rumors-heres-what-happened/articleshow/118075531.cms,"President Trump said he would not deport Harry because he already has enough problems because of his wife Meghan Markle.

Donald Trump always hated Meghan Markle; his old video with Joe Morgan viral



Why could Harry be deported? What is the visa case?



President Donald Trump unwittingly dropped a major hint about the marital problems of Harry and Meghan Markle as he, in an interview with the New York Post, said he has no interest in pursuing the visa case against Harry. ""I'll leave him alone. He's got enough problems with his wife. She's terrible,"" Donald Trump said without naming Meghan Markle.A lot has been discussed about Harry and Meghan's marriage problems with insiders claiming that they are on the verge of a divorce.Vanity Fair did a cover story about the ex-royals in which they claimed that Meghan Markle was approached to write a ""post-divorce"" book though there was no such scenario on the horizon. Then there were speculations that they were separating their professional lives -- with Meghan Markle focussing on her shows and entrepreneurial works and Harry remaining busy with his philanthropic works. But Harry and Meghan made several joint appearances since then -- they visited relief centers in Los Angeles to help the fire victims; they appeared together to launch the Invictus Games in Vancouver Saturday.In 2022, Donald Trump spoke about Harry and Meghan on the Piers Morgan show and said he was never a fan of Meghan Markle.""I'm not a fan of Meghan, I'm not a fan, and I wasn't right from the beginning. I think poor Harry is being led around by his nose.,"" Trump said in the old interview.""Do you think it's going to end?"" Piers Morgan asked. ""I do, I've been a very good predictor, as you know, I've predicted almost everything, it'll end, and it'll end bad,"" the former president replied. ""I wonder if Harry's going to go back on his hands and knees and say please. You know, I think Harry's been led down a path.""""I would, the only thing I disagree with the Queen on, probably one of the only things ever, is that I think she should have said, 'If that's your choice fine, but you no longer have titles and frankly don't come around,'"" Trump said. ""He has been so disrespectful to the country and I think he's an embarrassment.""After stepping down as royals, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle settled in the US, in Montecito. After Harry's memoir Spare was published, he was accused of lying in his visa form as in his book, he admitted to taking marijuana, cocaine, and psychedelic drugs. Every US visa applicant has to give information about their drug history. Either Harry lied about drugs in the form or he was given preferential treatment, the lawsuit claimed demanding Harry's visa records. But the judge ruled in favor of Harry that his visa records would remain private. Donald Trump could have pursued the case and Harry-Meghan reportedly expected that but Trump said he would leave Harry alone.","President Trump said he would not deport Harry because he already has enough problems because of his wife Meghan Markle.

Not only Democrat Congressman Ro Khanna who dragged JD Vance's children to the debate, the vice president was asked by social media users why he did not feel any rage against the person's India-hatred while he is married to a woman of Indian descent.JD Vance said he did not agree to Marko Elez's posts but he does not believe that past social media activities should ruin his life. Elon Musk agreed and announced that he would bring him back as ""to err is human"".Journalist Zaid Jilani opined that firing him from DOGE for his past posts does not mean his whole life would be ruined; it just means that he does not have the professionalism to be a high-level government staffer. ""Maybe if the staffer is a ""kid"" and doesn't know any better, they should take a time out and grow up before they seek a job like that,"" Jilani wrote.JD Vance replied to Jilani and blamed how the issue has been treated with so much seriousness like Marko Elez is a cabinet secretary. ""First of all, he's a staffer. There are many layers between him and the President of the United States. people act like he's a cabinet secretary,"" the VP said.Blaming Wall Street Journal for playing it up, Vance said, ""The WSJ and others made his name a national news story. He's now the object of 10 seconds of hate from maladjusted leftwingers. They are explicitly trying to ruin his life.""A Wall Street Journal report linked Marko Elez to some now-deleted social media posts like: ""Just for the record, I was racist before it was cool""; ""I would not mind at all if Gaza and Israel were both wiped off the face of the Earth""; ""You could not pay me to marry outside of my ethnicity"", ""Normalize Indian hate"" etc.","JD Vance said he did not agree to Marko Elez's posts but he does not believe that past social media activities should ruin his life.

US edging towards constitutional crisis as Dem state courts block Trump action,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-edging-towards-constitutional-crisis-as-dem-state-courts-block-trump-action/articleshow/118071519.cms,"TOI correspondent from Washington

: The first contours of a constitutional crisis and a potential civil war, at least on the legal front, are sharpening in America. A federal judge in New York issued an emergency order on Saturday prohibiting Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency from accessing personal and financial data of millions of Americans kept at the Treasury Department, after Attorneys General from 19 Democrat-run states sued to stop the intrusion.Initiated by New York AG Letitia James, the attorneys general said the president had given “virtually unfettered access” to the federal government’s most sensitive information Musk's young DOGE aides who are now “attempting to access government data to support initiatives to block federal funds from reaching certain disfavored beneficiaries.”Separately, another federal judge issued a restraining order pausing the administrative leave of 2200 USAID employees and the withdrawal nearly all of the agency’s overseas workers, as the US legal system kicked in to constrain the Trump effort to dismantle the traditional norms of governance the President sees as deeply flawed and corrupt.Other court rulings this week have blocked Trump moves to freeze federal spending and overturn birthright citizenship, even as the President is expanding his blitz against Democrats with what his supporters characterize as a ""flood the zone"" policy aimed at overwhelming them on many fronts.On Friday, Trump announced, among other steps, that he is sacking members of the board of trustees for the storied Kennedy Centre in Washington DC and naming himself chairman. Maintaining that the current trustees ""do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture,"" Trump smacked down on the center recently featuring ""Drag Shows specifically targeting our youth,"" and asserted, ""THIS WILL STOP.""Opening new fronts almost every hour, Trump also fired the head of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), Colleen Shogan, a Biden-appointee and the first woman to serve in the post. The President has reportedly been miffed by the agency’s role in the Justice Department’s investigation and prosecution over classified documents kept at his Mar-a-Lago home after his first term, although Shogan was not in charge at the time.For that matter, Trump extended his pique against the former President himself, revoking Biden's security clearance and classified briefings in a payback for what Biden had done to him.Fired up by a MAGA base celebrating the dismantling of what it sees as the entrenched establishment in Washington DC, Trump acolytes virtually defaced the USAID lettering stenciled in granite at the entrance of its HQ, cheered on by Elon Musk, who also celebrated with an ""RIP"" message the demise of the Consumer Forum Protection Board (CFPB), whose head Rohit Chopra was fired by Trump earlier this week.So intense and vitriolic is the resentment and pressure from the base towards the establishment that the Trump dispensation is avoiding any reminders about USAID being heartily backed during his first term by the President's own daughter Ivanka, and the Senator-turned Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who said the institution was vital to America's interests.The virtual sacking of long-established government institutions and programs is triggering alarms from Democratic lawmakers, liberal activists, and commentators about an ongoing coup and an upcoming constitutional crisis. Many are rushing to courts finding temporary reprieve and succor largely in Democratic-governed states amid a widening political schism in America.On Friday, the Washington Post, long an establishment sentinel whose current owner Jeff Bezos is now a Trump supporter, said the term constitutional crisis ""recalls some of the most perilous moments in American history, from the Civil War to Watergate."" Trump aides dismissed the talk as overheated and overblown.",A federal judge in New York issued an emergency order on Saturday prohibiting Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency from accessing personal and financial data of millions of Americans.

Policemen at the checkpost offered stiff resistance in an encounter which lasted two hours, following which the terrorists fled,” the provincial police said in a statement.Pakistan has experienced an escalation in militancy in KP, adjacent to Afghanistan, following the collapse of a tenuous truce between TTP and the state in Nov 2022.Pakistani authorities have linked the surge in militant violence to cross-border incursions from Afghanistan, alleging that the Kabul administration is facilitating TTP fighters, a claim Afghan authorities refute. Most of these assaults have been directed at security and law-enforcement personnel, although civilians and govt officials have also been impacted.In KP’s Dera Ismail Khan district last week, four soldiers were killed by gunfire and an improvised explosive device (IED) unleashed by terrorists.In Balochistan, another restive province in Pakistan’s south, 18 soldiers were killed in an attack by terrorists earlier this month.Islamabad think-tank Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) has described 2024 as the most lethal year for security forces in a decade, with a minimum of 685 military and police fatalities resulting from 444 terror attacks.Alongside such attacks, militants have stepped up targeted killings and kidnappings of officials in KP and Balochistan.","Nearly a dozen militants stormed a police check post at Karak district in Pakistan’s restive northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province.

ISLAMABAD : The UN refugees and migration agencies on Wednesday expressed their concern over Pakistan 's decision to deport thousands of Afghan refugees awaiting relocation to the United States and elsewhere.The UN refugee agency, UNHCR , and the international organization for migration in a statement said they were seeking clarification from Pakistan, which said last week it would deport the refugees back to Afghanistan unless their cases were processed quickly by the countries that had agreed to take them in.About 20,000 Afghans were approved for resettlement in the US under a program that helps people at risk because of their work with the American government, media, aid agencies and rights groups. They were among tens of thousands of Afghans who fled to neighboring Pakistan after their country fell to the Taliban in 2021.However, they were left in limbo after President Donald Trump paused US refugee programs last month.""A UNHCR-issued non-return advisory has been in place since 2021, calling for a suspension of forced returns of Afghan nationals from any country regardless of their status,"" the joint UNHCR-IOM statement said.Pakistan's prime minister Shehbaz Sharif last week gave the green light to evict Afghans without papers from the cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi before March 31, in preparation for deportation if they were not relocated to their host countries.UNHCR and IOM said they are especially concerned for Afghan nationals who face a risk of harm upon return, such as ethnic and religious minorities, women and girls, journalists, human rights activists, and members of artistic professions like musicians and others.It said since January 1, 2025, an uptick in arrests of Afghan nationals in Islamabad and Rawalpindi has caused significant distress, with reports of Afghan nationals of various documentation statuses being rounded up.The Trump administration also announced the US refugee admissions program would be suspended from January 27 for at least three months. It has shocked Afghans who were hoping to travel to the United States soon.Afghans in Pakistan have been virtually living in hiding since 2023 when a crackdown began on foreigners who are in the country without proper documentation. An estimated 800,000 Afghans have either gone back voluntarily or been deported since despite criticism from UN agencies, rights groups and the Taliban.Besides thousands of Afghans who are living in Pakistan and awaiting travel to host countries, there are around 1.45 million Afghan nationals registered with UNHCR as refugees in Pakistan as well but their stay has been extended until June.In the statement, UNHCR and IOM urged ""Pakistan to implement any relocation measures with due consideration for human rights standards, including due process, and the legal status of proof of registration (POR) and afghan citizen card (ACC) holders, who have resided in Pakistan for an extended period of time"".""Pakistan has a proud tradition of hosting refugees, saving millions of lives. This generosity is greatly appreciated,"" UNHCR representative in Pakistan Philippa Candler said.""IOM is committed to work with the government of Pakistan and UNHCR to develop a mechanism to register, manage and screen Afghan nationals in Pakistan,"" said IOM chief of mission, Mio Sato.She said ""This will open the door to tailored solutions including international protection to those in need and pathways for Afghan nationals, with long-standing socioeconomic and family ties in the country.""","UN refugees and migration agencies express concern over Pakistan's decision to deport thousands of Afghan refugees.

He said one soldier of the Frontier Corps (FC), a paramilitary force, was separately killed in clashes with the militants.“The bodies of the slain soldiers were shifted to Quetta,” Shabbir said. “We don’t know how many attackers were killed because they took the bodies of their fighters into the mountains in the dark.”He said three FC personnel were also injured in the attack, adding that militants set a private bank on fire in Mangochar Bazaar.Separatist groups like BLA have long been at the forefront of a low-level insurgency in Balochistan, Pakistan's largest province by area and rich in mineral resources.

The South Asian nation of 170 million people has struggled with political strife since Hasina was forced to flee to India in Aug following weeks of protests against her rule in which more than 1,000 people were killed.Witnesses said several thousand protesters, some armed with sticks, hammers and other tools, gathered around the historic house and independence monument while others brought a crane and excavator to demolish the building late on Wednesday.The demolition continued into Thursday, with much of the front of the house destroyed. Many people were seen breaking into it and taking steel and wooden items and books from inside. Similar cases of vandalism also took place at several other places, targeting Awami League leaders. At least two people, accused of being members of Awami League, were beaten by the crowd, witnesses said, reported AFP.The protest rally was organised alongside a broader call, dubbed ""Bulldozer Procession"", to disrupt Hasina's scheduled online address on Wednesday. Protesters, many aligned with the ""Students Against Discrimination"" group, voiced fury over her speech they saw as a challenge to the newly formed interim govt.A symbol of the country's establishment, the house is where Mujibur Rahman declared Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan in 1971.

Demonstrators burned Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's residence, damaged murals

Bangladesh has formally lodged a ""strong protest"" with India regarding statements made by deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina , particularly those concerning the alleged recent vandalism of her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman 's house.Bangladesh slammed Hasina's latest speech as being ""false and fabricated"", adding that it views the former PM's statements and activities while in exile in India as a ""hostile act"".It has requested that India prevent her from making further speeches, citing the importance of mutual respect and the historical relationship between the two countries.""The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh lodged a strong protest with the Government of India over the false and fabricated comments and statements continuously being made in different platforms including social media, by the former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, instigating instability in Bangladesh. Through the protest note, handed over to the Acting High Commissioner of India in Dhaka, the Ministry conveyed the deep concern, disappointment and serious reservation of the Government of Bangladesh, as such statements are hurting the sentiments of the people in Bangladesh....The Ministry also emphasized that such activities by her, are considered as a hostile act towards Bangladesh and are not conducive to the efforts at establishing a healthy relationship between the two countries,"" the bangladesh foreign ministry said in a post on Facebook.On Thursday, the Bangladesh's foreign ministry summoned the acting high commissioner of India to Dhaka. Bangladesh foreign adviser Md Touhid Hossain said Bangladesh had formally requested India in writing to prevent Sheikh Hasina from making such statements and remarks, as those are against the interests of Bangladesh.He also said, ""We have not got any response in this regard. Due to recent developments, Bangladesh has once again sent a protest note to India. Indian acting high commissioner was summoned and handed over the protest letter so that she (Sheikh Hasina) is prevented.""Hasina delivered the speech on Wednesday night after protesters vandalised and set on fire her father and Bangladesh founder Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's residence in Dhaka. Similar cases of vandalism also took place at several other places, targeting Awami League leaders.During her address, Hasina urged citizens to mount opposition against the present administration.Speaking with evident emotion, Hasina noted that whilst Pakistani forces had plundered the house during the 1971 Liberation War, they neither demolished nor burnt it.""Today, this house is being demolished. What crime had it committed? Why were they so afraid of the house... I seek justice from the people of the country. Didn't I do anything for you?"" she said.""They can demolish a building, but not the history... but they must also remember that history takes its revenge,"" Hasina said.""They are yet to have the strength to destroy the national flag, the constitution and the independence that we earned at the cost of lives of millions of martyrs with a bulldozer,"" she said, seemingly referring to the Muhammad Yunus-led interim government.Demonstrators gathered near Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's 32 Dhanmondi residence in Dhaka, responding to social media calls for a ""bulldozer procession"". The crowd subsequently ignited the building.The neighbouring structure, which served as offices for various Awami League organisations, was also destroyed. Protesters damaged murals featuring Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.Demonstrators also set ablaze 'Sudha Sadan' on Road 5 in Dhanmondi, the residence of Hasina's deceased husband Wajed Mian.The homes of her cousins - Sheikh Helal Uddin and Sheikh Salauddin Jewel - in Khulna City were also destroyed by protesters.Students removed Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's name from Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Hall of Dhaka University in protest.At 77, Hasina has been residing in India since August 5 of the previous year, having escaped Bangladesh amidst a significant student-led uprising that ended her Awami League's 16-year governance.","Bangladesh has formally lodged a ""strong protest"" with India regarding statements made by deposed PM Sheikh Hasina.

Ousted Bangladeshi leader and former prime minister Sheikh Hasina called for justice after a mob vandalised her father Mujibur Rahman 's house on Wednesday.""They can demolish a building, but not the history... but they must also remember that the history takes its revenge,"" she said in an emotional address.""Today, this house is being demolished. What crime had it committed? Why were they so afraid of the house...I seek justice from the people of the country. Didn't I do anything for you?"" she added.In an apparent attack on the interim government chief Mohammed Yunus, Hasina said, ""They are yet to have the strength to destroy the national flag, the constitution and the independence that we earned at the cost of lives of millions of martyrs with a bulldozer.""Hasina was addressing an event organized by the now-disbanded student wing Chhatra League of the Awami League , urged the nation to unite in resistance against the current regime.The deposed premier recalled that while Pakistani troops looted the house during the 1971 Liberation War, they neither demolished nor set it on fire.""Today, this house is being demolished. What crime had it committed? Why were they so afraid of the house... I seek justice from the people of the country. Didn't I do anything for you?"" she said.Protesters on Thursday desecrated the house of the country's founding father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, after vandalizing and setting it on fire on Wednesday night. The violence escalated as demonstrators tore down homes belonging to leaders of Awami League and defaced murals of Mujibur Rahman, following the deposed prime minister’s online address.Several thousand people had gathered in front of Mujibur Rahman’s former residence—now a memorial museum—in Dhaka’s Dhanmondi area, responding to a social media call for a ""Bulldozer Procession"" coinciding with Hasina’s speech.The 77-year-old has been living in India since August 5 last year after fleeing Bangladesh in the wake of a massive student-led uprising that ended her Awami League’s 16-year rule.While her father is widely regarded as a hero of Bangladesh’s independence, growing public anger toward Hasina has cast a shadow over his legacy. Mujibur Rahman was assassinated along with most of his family in a military coup on August 15, 1975, while Hasina and her sister Rehana were in Germany.","Ousted Bangladeshi leader and former prime minister Sheikh Hasina called for justice after a mob vandalised her father Mujibur Rahman's house on Wednesday.

Prince William’s ‘savage’ comment on Kate’s wardrobe before she became a royal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/prince-williams-savage-comment-on-kates-wardrobe-before-she-became-a-royal/articleshow/118061491.cms,"Prince William’s ‘savage’ comment on Kate’s wardrobe before she became a royal (Picture credit: AP)

Prince William once made a ""savage"" joke about his wife, Princess Kate, over an outfit he deemed inappropriate, a royal adviser revealed. Before becoming a senior royal, Kate was still fine-tuning her style, leading to a moment of playful banter between the couple.According to an adviser who spoke to The Times, William was unimpressed with one of Kate’s fashion choices early in their relationship.“Before Kate realized that as a senior royal, you have to dress carefully, having taken advice, she once bought an outfit that William considered inappropriate,” the adviser said.“He told Kate she looked as if she’d just run through a charity shop covered in superglue. Everyone thought this was very funny, including, to her credit, Kate”, the adviser added.While the exact outfit was not revealed, it likely occurred during Kate’s transition from pre-royal life, where she was seen at London parties in bold ensembles, to her more refined royal wardrobe.Kate has since become a global style icon, with her wardrobe choices sparking trends worldwide. Known as the "" Kate Effect ,"" her fashion choices now include elegant designs from Alexander McQueen and Jenny Packham.She has also mastered ""mindful dressing"", carefully selecting outfits to pay tribute to host countries on royal tours, as per the Hello! magazine.Despite her polished image today, Kate’s earlier fashion moments were far more daring.Notably, she is said to have caught William’s eye in 2002, wearing a sheer Charlotte Todd dress at a St Andrews University fashion show. In 2008, she showcased her style in a green sequin halterneck top, neon-yellow hot pants, pink leg warmers and knee-high boots at a charity roller disco, according to Hello! magazine.This lighthearted teasing is nothing new for the couple. Over the years, they have been seen joking together in public, with Kate often playfully teasing William.During a 2018 visit to a UK military base in Cyprus, William warned soldiers: ""Keep the pizza off the sofas!"" to which Kate quipped: ""You're a nightmare with that.""Kate has also teased William about his appearance, reportedly telling him he is beginning to resemble his great-great-great-grandfather, Edward VII, as per the Mirror.Despite her initial learning curve, Kate quickly adapted to royal life. As per The Times, she took time to observe and absorb royal expectations, rather than trying to change things too quickly.""She bides her time and is very intelligent and intuitive about other people, what they do, and how they behave,"" a royal source told the publication.Kate was also guided by William and palace staff, ensuring she avoided the struggles Princess Diana faced.","Prince William once made a ""savage"" joke about his wife, Princess Kate, over an outfit he deemed inappropriate, a royal adviser revealed.
