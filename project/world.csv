This statement follows his recent order for the police personnel to leave the Governor House premises, which has not been complied with as they continue to perform their duties there.

“I have reasons to believe that the presence of the current officer-in-charge and his team is a threat to my personal security,” Bose told PTI.

“I have informed Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee that I am insecure with Kolkata Police in Raj Bhavan, but there was no action,” he said.

According to sources within the governor house, Bose has lodged a complaint with the state government, alleging that the police personnel posted in Raj Bhavan have been constantly snooping on him. He suspects that this surveillance is being carried out at the behest of external ""influencers.""

Russia mulling lowering nukes use threshold?

The existing doctrine states that Russia may use such weapons in response to a nuclear attack or in the event of a conventional attack that poses an existential threat to the state.

Since the start of the war in Ukraine, some hawks among Russian military analysts have been advocating that Russia should lower its threshold for nuclear use. Putin said, however, that there was no need for Russia to carry out a pre-emptive nuclear strike.

He was speaking to reporters a day after visiting nuclear-armed North Korea for a summit with its leader, Kim Jong-un. The two leaders signed a treaty under which each side promised to provide immediate military assistance to the other in the event of armed aggression against either one of them. Russian state media quoted Putin as saying that Moscow expected that its cooperation with North Korea would serve as a deterrent to the West, but that there was no need to use North Korean soldiers in the war in Ukraine.

Putin also said he did not rule out Russia supplying high-precision weapons to North Korea. This announcement prompted South Korea to say it would consider sending arms to Ukraine, a major policy change. The Russian prez said, in response, Seoul would be making ""a big mistake"" if it decides to supply arms to Ukraine. He added South Korea has ""nothing to worry"".

PM Netanyahu has insisted Israel will pursue the fight against Hamas until its military and governing capabilities in the Palestinian territory are eliminated. But with the war now in its ninth month, frustration has been mounting with no clear end or postwar plan in sight. ""This business of destroying Hamas, making Hamas disappear - it's simply throwing sand in the eyes of the public,"" Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the military spokesperson, told Israel's Channel 13 TV. ""Hamas is an idea, Hamas is a party. It's rooted in the hearts of the people - whoever thinks we can eliminate Hamas is wrong.""

Netanyahu's office responded by saying that the country's security cabinet, chaired by the PM, ""has defined the destruction of Hamas' military and governing capabilities as one of the goals of the war. The Israeli military, of course, is committed to this."" The military quickly issued a clarification, saying it was ""committed to achieving the goals of the war as defined by the cabinet"" and that it has been working on this ""throughout the war, day and night, and will continue to do so."" Hagari's comments, it said, ""referred to the destruction of Hamas as an ideology and an idea"".

There have already been open signs of discontent over the handling of the war. Benny Gantz, an ex-military chief, withdrew from war cabinet this month. Early this week, Netanyahu expressed displeasure with the army's decision to declare a ""tactical pause"" in Rafah for humanitarian aid.

While the police managed to arrest the groom and the 'Nikah Khwan' (a person who solemnizes the marriage), the girl's father managed to escape.A case has been registered against the girl's father, the 72-year-old man, and the 'Nikkah Khwan' under the Child Marriage Act , according to ARY News. Despite the existence of laws prohibiting child marriage, such incidents continue to occur in various parts of Pakistan. The minor girl was sent to a hospital for a medical examination.The girl's father, Alam Syed, had reportedly agreed to sell his daughter to the elderly man for PKR 500,000.In recent times, law enforcement agencies have thwarted similar attempts in Rajanpur and Thatta, where young girls were being coerced into marrying older men. In Rajanpur, Punjab, an 11-year-old girl was set to marry a 40-year-old man, while in Thatta, a young girl was forcibly married to a 50-year-old landlord before the police took action and rescued the girl.In another incident on May 6, a 70-year-old man was arrested by the police for marrying a 13-year-old girl in Swat. The girl's father had arranged the marriage, but the police swiftly took the groom and the father into custody. The 'Nikkah Khwan' and the marriage witnesses were also arrested, and the minor girl was sent to a hospital for a medical examination.In Pakistan, the legal age for marriage differs based on gender. While the internationally recognized minimum age for both males and females is 18, the country's laws allow males to marry at 18 but permit females to wed at the younger age of 16.Although Sindh province took a step towards gender equality in 2013 by passing legislation to raise the minimum age of marriage to 18 for both genders, this progressive change has not been adopted and implemented throughout the nation. The disparity in legal marriage age between men and women persists in other parts of the nation.","The marriage of a 12-year-old girl to a 72- year-old man was called off after successful intervention by the police in Pakistan's Charsadda town.

"900+ dead, including 68 Indians, during haj as Mecca temp hits 51.8C: Report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/900-dead-including-68-indians-during-haj-as-mecca-temp-hits-51-8c-report/articleshow/111120887.cms,"Friends and family searched for missing haj pilgrims on Wednesday as the death toll at the annual rituals, which were carried out in scorching heat , surged past 900.Relatives scoured hospitals and pleaded online for news, fearing the worst after temperatures hit 51.8C in Mecca, Islam's holiest city, on Monday.About 1.8 million people from all over the world, many old and infirm, took part in the days-long, mostly outdoor pilgrimage, held this year during the oven-like Saudi summer.An Arab diplomat told AFP that deaths among Egyptians alone had jumped to ""at least 600"", from over 300 a day earlier, mostly from the unforgiving heat. That figure brought the total reported dead so far to 922, according to an AFP tally of figures released by various nations.A diplomat in Saudi Arabia said 68 Indian nationals had died during the haj pilgrimage. ""Some are because of natural causes and we had many old-age pilgrims. And some are due to the weather conditions, that's what we assume,"" the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told AFP.In addition to Egypt, fatalities have also been confirmed by Jordan, Indonesia, Iran, Senegal, Tunisia and Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region, though in many cases authorities have not specified the cause.Saudi Arabia has not provided information on fatalities, though it reported more than 2,700 cases of ""heat exhaustion"" on Sunday alone. The country has spent billions of dollars on crowd control and safety measures for those attending the annual five-day pilgrimage, but the sheer number of participants makes ensuring their safety difficult.Social media networks have been flooded with pictures of the missing and requests for information. Those searching for news include family and friends of Ghada Mahmoud Ahmed Dawood, an Egyptian pilgrim unaccounted for since Saturday. ""The good news is that until now we did not find her on the list of the dead people, which gives us hope she is still alive,"" said one family friend based in Saudi Arabia.The haj is one of the five pillars of Islam and all Muslims with the means must complete it at least once. Its timing is determined by the Islamic lunar calendar, shifting forward each year in the Gregorian calendar. For the past several years the mainly outdoor rituals have fallen during the sweltering Saudi summer. According to a Saudi study published last month, temperatures in the area are rising 0.4C each decade. A 2019 study by experts at MIT found that even if the world succeeds in mitigating the worst effects of climate change, the Haj would be held in temperatures exceeding an ""extreme danger threshold"" from 2047 to 2052, and from 2079 to 2086.Deaths aren't uncommon at the Haj, which has drawn at times over 2 million people to Saudi Arabia. Last year more than 200 pilgrims were reported dead. There have also been stampedes and epidemics through the pilgrimage's history. A 2015 stampede in Mina during the haj killed over 2,400 pilgrims, the deadliest incident to ever strike the pilgrimage, an AP count showed. Saudi Arabia has never acknowledged the full toll of the stampede. A separate crane collapse at Mecca's Grand Mosque, which preceded the Mina disaster, killed 111 people. The second-deadliest incident at hajj was a 1990 stampede that killed 1,426 people.","Friends and family search for missing haj pilgrims as death toll surges past 900. Temperatures hit 51.8C in Mecca, Islam's holiest city, on Monday. About 1.8 million people from all over the world took part in the days-long pilgrimage.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111120940,imgsize-1724613,width-400,resizemode-4/111120940.jpg"

A collision between a Philippine ship and a Chinese vessel occurred on Monday near the Spratly Islands in the disputed South China Sea , according to Beijing's Coast Guard .Beijing claims nearly the entirety of the South China Sea, a vital waterway facilitating over $3 trillion in annual maritime trade which is subject to overlapping claims by several nations, including China, the Philippines , Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei.China deploys various boats to patrol the waters and has transformed several reefs into militarised artificial islands. A series of confrontations between Chinese and Philippine vessels have occurred in disputed areas.New Chinese coast guard rules took effect on Saturday, June 15, which reinforce a 2021 law granting its coastguard the authority to use deadly force against foreign vessels in contested waters.Under these new rules, China's coastguard is empowered to apprehend suspected trespassers and detain them for up to 60 days without the need for a trial.In a statement, the Beijing's Coast Guard said, ""Philippine replenishment ship ignored many solemn warnings from the Chinese side"".It ""approached the... Chinese vessel in an unprofessional way, resulting in a collision"", the statement said.""The Chinese Coast Guard took control measures against the Philippine ship in accordance with the law,"" it added.Beijing accused the ship of having ""illegally broken into the sea near Ren'ai Reef in China's Nansha Islands"", using the Chinese name for the Spratly Islands.Manila has accused the Chinese coast guard of ""barbaric and inhumane behaviour"" against Philippine vessels, and President Ferdinand Marcos has called the new rules a ""very worrisome"" escalation.China has defended its new coast guard rules, with a foreign ministry spokesman saying last month that they were intended to ""better uphold order at sea"".The Group of Seven bloc criticised what it called ""dangerous"" incursions by China in the South China Sea on Friday. Recent confrontations between China and the Philippines have raised concerns about a wider conflict over the sea that could involve the United States and other allies.Multiple dollars in ship-borne trade passes through the South China Sea annually, and vastly unexploited oil and gas deposits that are believed to lie beneath its seabed, although estimates vary greatly.The Philippines has encountered various challenges while attempting to provide supplies to its troops stationed on an old naval vessel that was intentionally grounded to assert the country's maritime claims.Chinese Coast Guard ships have employed water cannons to target boats from the Philippines on multiple occasions and several collisions have occurred, resulting in injuries to the Filipino troops.","Beijing claims nearly the entirety of the South China Sea, a vital waterway facilitating over $3 trillion in annual maritime trade.

Floodwaters inundate Minnesota towns while another storm transformed New Mexico village into a lake,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/floodwaters-inundate-minnesota-towns-while-another-storm-transformed-new-mexico-village-into-a-lake/articleshow/111152179.cms,"COOK: Several small-town tourist meccas in northern Minnesota have been inundated by floodwaters after a deluge of rain earlier this week, while another powerful storm turned a New Mexico village into a lake.In St. Louis County, Minnesota - the home of Duluth - people navigated flood-ridden streets with kayaks and other small boats, photos taken by KARE-TV showed.Meanwhile, a storm in the 200-person village of Willard, New Mexico, on Wednesday unleashed a thick curtain of 6 to 8 inches of rain and lime-sized hail in the town outside of Albuquerque, as fire crews farther south in the mountain village of Ruidoso were still battling a pair of deadly wildfires . Some parts of New Mexico don't see that much rainfall in an entire year, National Weather Service meteorologist Brian Guyer said.The National Weather Service warned that more significant rain is possible in Minnesota over the next three days in areas with saturated ground and swollen rivers after receiving more torrential rain on Tuesday. Parts of St. Louis, Itasca and Lake counties recorded more than 7 inches of rain.Dozens of roads were washed out across northern Minnesota after the storm, totally cutting off access to lakeside resorts and causing tens of millions of dollars' worth of damage. Officials in St. Louis County declared a disaster after estimating the floods had caused at least $50 million in damage and prompted the closure of more than 40 roads there.Duluth itself fared better thanks to the improvements it made in its flood defenses after the record floods of 2012. But other smaller towns like Cook and Biwabik were not as fortunate. Gov. Tim Walz plans to tour the damage there on Friday.""It's just sheer devastation,"" said Ryan Horner, who runs the 85-year old Comet Theater in downtown Cook that is covered with at least three feet of water. Inside the theater, Horner told Minnesota Public Radio that the water has filled the basement and is now more than chest deep at the bottom of the auditorium.Elsewhere near Lake Vermillion, the flooding cut off all the roads into Glenwood Lodge, meaning the only way into the fully booked resort is by boat right now.""We're stuck in here. We're not going anywhere with a vehicle,"" resort owner Billy Muelken said.Willard, New Mexico, is feeling the effects of what happens when the state's wildfire and monsoon seasons overlap.""We went from catastrophic wildfires one day to catastrophic flooding the next,"" said Guyer, of the National Weather Service.Within minutes after commercial truck driver Mike Bischoff received an emergency alert that a storm was on the way, he was already stuck in it. The 54-year-old was driving his semi-truck on Highway 42 when the hail started to pour down and the flash floods surrounded him and the other drivers on the road.Stuck in the storm, Bischoff said the hail poured down and a funnel cloud appeared in the sky.""My semi weighs 80,000 pounds, and it was rocking,"" Bischoff said.Much of the Southwest has been exceedingly dry and hot in recent months. Those conditions, along with strong wind, whipped flames out of control, rapidly advancing the South Fork Fire into Ruidoso. Evacuations extended to hundreds of homes, businesses, a regional hospital and the Ruidoso Downs horse track.",Several small-town tourist meccas in northern Minnesota have been inundated by floodwaters after a deluge of rain earlier this week.

"Donald Sutherland, whose career spanned 'M.A.S.H.' to 'Hunger Games', dies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-sutherland-whose-career-spanned-m-a-s-h-to-hunger-games-dies/articleshow/111150499.cms,"Donald Sutherland , whose ability to both charm and unsettle, both reassure and repulse, was amply displayed in scores of film roles as diverse as a laid-back battlefield surgeon in ""M*A*S*H"", a ruthless Nazi spy in ""Eye of the Needle"", a soulful father in ""Ordinary People"" and a strutting fascist in ""1900"", has died. He was 88. His son Kiefer Sutherland announced the death, but did not specify the cause.With his long face, droopy eyes, protruding ears and wolfish smile, the 6-foot-4 Sutherland was never anyone's idea of a movie heartthrob. He often recalled that while growing up in eastern Canada, he once asked his mother if he was good-looking, only to be told, ""No, but your face has a lot of character."" He recounted how he was once rejected for a film role by a producer who said: ""This part calls for a guy-next-door type. You don't look like you've lived next door to anyone."" And yet across six decades, starting in the early 1960s, he appeared in nearly 200 films and TV shows - some years he was in as many as half a dozen movies. His chameleon-like ability to be endearing in one role, menacing in another and just plain odd in yet a third appealed to directors, among them Federico Fellini, Robert Altman, Bernardo Bertolucci and Oliver Stone. ""For me, working with these great guys was like falling in love,"" Sutherland said of those filmmakers. ""I was their lover, their beloved.""Sutherland first came to the attention of many moviegoers as one of the army misfits and sociopaths in ""The Dirty Dozen"" (1967), set during WWII. His character had almost no lines until he was told to take over from another actor . ""You with the big ears - you do it!"" he recalled the director, Robert Aldrich, yelling at him. ""He didn't even know my name.""While Sutherland worked almost nonstop to the very end, some of his more memorable roles fell in a stretch from 1970 to 1981, when he appeared in 34 films, often playing men who walked a fine line between sanity and madness - and on occasion erased that line. His fascist in Bertolucci's ""1900"" (1976), his heavily made-up Lothario in ""Fellini's Casanova"" (1976) and his murderous WWII spy in ""Eye of the Needle"" (1981) were examples of his capacity for the grotesque and the ominous.But he could also be winningly irreverent, as in a pivotal early role: Hawkeye Pierce, an insolent mobile-hospital surgeon, in Robert Altman's ""M*A*S*H"" (1970), set during the Korean War but with distinctly Vietnam-era sensibilities. Despite the critical acclaim that he usually enjoyed, he never received an Academy Award nomination. There were other honours, though, including a 1995 Emmy for his role as a Soviet investigator in ""Citizen X"", an HBO film. He also won two Golden Globes - for ""Citizen X"" and for his 2002 portrayal of the presidential adviser Clark Clifford in HBO's ""Path to War"". Well-received performances included the kindly Mr. Bennet in ""Pride & Prejudice"" (2005) the president in the dystopian "" Hunger Games "" series of the 2010s.","His son Kiefer Sutherland announced the death, but did not specify the cause.

Thompson, who hails from Elyria, Ohio , is being represented by a Hall County public defender.Sgt. Joshua Moline of the Hall County Sheriff's Office stated in an affidavit filed in court that a portion of the attack was recorded on a trucker's dash cam, while some of it occurred out of sight inside Gary and Mary Weaver 's RV around 7 am Wednesday. The video footage showed a man entering the RV and making stabbing motions toward the woman before moving out of view. When the woman exited the RV, the man followed and stabbed her multiple times in the head before she collapsed to the ground, briefly pausing to shout at the trucker in the semi.Inside the RV, deputies discovered Gary Weaver with wounds to his chest and head. The 72-year-old later succumbed to his injuries at a Grand Island hospital. Mary Weaver, 71, was found sitting on the ground beside the RV, bleeding. Initially in critical condition with what the sheriff described as life-threatening injuries, her condition has since improved to stable as of Thursday.The Jeep, which had been detached from the RV, had blood on it. The Weavers, who are from Eureka, Missouri, had been traveling through Nebraska when they were attacked.Before officers arrived at the rest area, Thompson fled in a Ford Focus. However, a Nebraska State Trooper quickly spotted him exiting the highway at Wood River. Thompson sped away at 120 mph over I-80, passing another driver before crashing into the Platte River. He was apprehended nearby, with blood on his shirt and several cuts on his hand.","James Thompson Jr, 22, was officially charged with first-degree murder and 10 other felonies, a day after the attack at a rest area near Grand Island in eastern Nebraska.

Hakimullah, a Shura member of the Pakistani Taliban's powerful Malakand faction, was killed in Chaghasarai, District Asadabad in the Kunar province, bordering Bajaur tribal district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in Pakistan, officials said on Wednesday.His killing comes as the TTP is observing a three-day ceasefire with the Pakistani government during the Eid al-Adha, which was celebrated on Monday.Hakimullah, who was the right-hand man of TTP Malakand chief Azmat Ullah Mehsud alias Wali Malakand, played a key role in terrorist activities in Bajaur and carried out various acts of violence including target killings, landmine explosions, checkpoint attacks, and extortion, The Express Tribune newspaper reported.He also served as a cleric at a madrassa of TTP in Sarkano, Kunar province of Afghanistan, and trained some of the key TTP commanders including Tahir alias Waqar, Umar alias Ismail and others.His death is seen as a significant setback for the TTP and underscores the internal conflicts among various armed factions operating within Afghanistan, the paper said.Citing sources, the papers said that the terrorist had joined the TTP in 2007 and took part in several actions against security forces and innocent civilians. His brother, Tariq alias Asad, is also related to the outlawed TTP, according to the sources.Hakimullah's killing comes days after TTP commander Waliullah was killed by the Pakistan's Counter-Terrorism Department in an intelligence-based operation in the Lakki Marwat district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Sunday.He was wanted by the Pakistani security forces in several terrorism cases including attacks on security convoys, and police posts, kidnapping for ransom, and extortion.Waliullah, a local commander of the TTP Tipu Gul group and the son-in-law of Commander Atiqur Rahman alias Tipu Gul Marwat was wanted in several cases of bomb blasts in Bannu, DI Khan and local police, and attacks on police and security forces.On April 27, TTP Malakand chapter commander Talha Swati was killed in the Asadabad area of Afghanistan's Kunar province, the paper reported, citing sources.According to reports, the slain terrorist was reporting on Jammatul Ahrar's activities to the South District Taliban, Islamic State Khorasan Province and his close aide Noor Wali Mehsud.There were conflicting reports surrounding the commander's death. Some reports suggested he was killed by ISKP, while others stated he was killed by a rival faction due to some internal rifts.The TTP, also known as the Pakistan Taliban, was set up as an umbrella group of several militant outfits in 2007. Its main aim is to impose its strict brand of Islam across Pakistan.The group, believed to be close to al-Qaeda and the Afghan Taliban, has been blamed for several deadly attacks across Pakistan, including an attack on army headquarters in 2009, assaults on military bases, and the 2008 bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad.","Hakimullah was a Shura member of the Pakistani Taliban's powerful Malakand faction.

The incident unfolded on May 25 in Sargodha's Mujahid Colony, where Nazir and other Christians were accused of blasphemy , sparking violent outrage among locals.After fighting for his life for eight days, Masih succumbed to his injuries on Sunday.The incident showed a troubling pattern in Pakistan where blasphemy accusations lead to violence against Christian communities.HRFP has expressed deep concern over the swift post-arrest bail granted to 52 attackers involved in the Sargodha incident.Despite the First Information Report (FIR) being filed against 44 identified and 400 unidentified suspects under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) 1997 and Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), progress in police investigations and court proceedings has been slow and inadequate.Compounding the community's apprehensions are threatening videos released by Islamic groups following the incident, exacerbating fears among the Christian community.Drawing parallels with the August 16, 2023, attack in Jaranwala, the HRFP report highlighted similar incidents of mob violence and property destruction against minorities. It underscores a recurring pattern involving provocation, and subsequent violence, often followed by the expedient release of perpetrators.HRFP has called for decisive action, citing intelligence reports linking extremist groups to multiple blasphemy allegations. The organization has also urged stringent measures to address these threats.The report also documented individual cases of violence and harassment against Christians across Pakistan.Farooq Masih's family in Jaranwala continues to face threats. Despite the FIR filed in February, the perpetrators are still at large.Similarly, the case of Saima Bibi, who suffered an assault in April, was downplayed as an 'accident' despite clear evidence of the attack.The plight of Rawal Masih, Romeo Masih, Waqas Masih, Rakhsana Bibi, Asifa Bibi, Shazia Zaulfiqar, and Ahsan Masih, who all were abducted and murdered, also underscores the ongoing oppression faced by PakistChristians.Naveed Walter, president of HRFP, emphasized the ""dire circumstances"" for minorities in Pakistan and urged increased protection and support for the Christian community. He called for an end to the misuse of blasphemy accusations and fabricated justifications for violence, stressing the need for systemic reforms to ensure minority safety.The HRFP report underscores the urgent situation faced by Christians in Pakistan and advocates for international and local intervention to uphold human rights and justice.","Human Rights Focus Pakistan (HRFP) has published a detailed fact-finding report uncovering disturbing incidents of religious persecution against Christians.

NEW DELHI: In a heart-wrenching display of their persistent sorrow and discontent, families affected by enforced disappearances in the Balochistan region of Pakistan decided to abandon customary Eid festivities. Instead, they planned to stage a protest to voice their outrage against state agencies alleged to have perpetrated atrocities against the Baloch people.

Mama Qadir Baloch , a key member of the Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP), declared the protest in a video statement, asserting, ""For the past 15 years, the atrocities committed by the Army and intelligence agencies of Pakistan have led the Baloch to boycott Eid celebrations. While Muslims across the world celebrate this occasion, the Baloch mourn.""

Coinciding with this, families of the missing persons organized a sit-in protest at Shaheed Fida Chowk on Eid day, following a similar demonstration in front of the DC office just days prior. The earlier protest concluded after the district administration provided assurances to the families.

The decision to protest on Eid emphasizes the profound impact of enforced disappearances on the Baloch community, who have been tirelessly seeking justice and answers regarding the fate of their loved ones, allegedly taken by state forces.

The five years coincide with the full term of the current govt led by Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) that took office earlier this year.“People come to us and tell us that if Pakistan has to progress, then Imran Khan will have to be kept in jail for five years,” Iqbal, the minister for planning and development as well as PML-N secretary-general, said.His comments came hours after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif pledged to rid the country of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), saying the next deal for a bailout package with the global lender would be the last in Pakistan’s history. IMF ties such loans to tough reform measures.According to Iqbal, if Imran came out of jail, “there would be sit-ins and fights again, which the country cannot afford”. “There is a voice of the people that Imran should remain in jail for five years,” Iqbal said. The minister added that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder was an “angry man” and it wasn’t known with whom he had a quarrel.The minister also made a subtle jab at the legal system by claiming Imran always relied on the “shoulder of the judiciary” for support during trying times. The allusion appeared to be to some court orders that went in favour of Imran in recent times.Asked about confrontation between the judiciary and the military establishment, Iqbal replied: “Both should think whether this is better for the country.”Iqbal recalled the past when politicians used to fight the military and vice versa. “Now we must cooperate for the benefit of the nation because fighting between institutions has put the country’s sovereignty at stake,” the minister said.","Ahsan Iqbal says Imran Khan will have to be kept behind bars for five years.
