Weighing Choices

JAWANIYA (BHOJPUR): Rivers give in abundance. But when swollen with fury, they plunder without mercy. This July, the primeval Ganga took everything that belonged to this riverine village in Bhojpur district of Bihar. It became a land grabber, a livelihood snatcher, a home wrecker and, as one gathers after visiting the habitation, a destroyer of dreams.Parts of Jawaniya now look like a lunatic’s playground — houses carved into pieces like cakes, dead bamboo forests and roads that abruptly end before a rivercreated precipice. About 200 homes, two water tanks, two schools and three temples were swallowed in the swirling waters. Over 300 bighas (1 bigha equals to 0.6 acres) of fecund land were gnawed away. Ward No. 5, and much of Ward No. 4, don’t exist anymore. Substantial parts of the village are now deemed unsafe. Jawaniya is comatose.Eighty-one-year-old Sriram Sahu has lived through many floods, but none like this. “I’d never seen so much water, such strong currents,” he says. Vijay Thakur, who lost 90% of his land, affirms. “Flood doesn’t scare us,” he says. “Soil erosion (katav) does. We had never imagined it would be this bad.”Ward member Ashish Pandey says the only mercy was that nobody died. “We managed to empty the homes in advance,” he says.The river has left a gaping hole in every Jawaniya heart. The loss of homes isn’t just financial. The sudden physical erasure of a place — where everyone lived, loved and grew up — has filled most villagers with an unbearable melancholy. “Ghar nahi raha, bas ab ghar ka moh bhar hai (There’s no home anymore, just a yearning for it),” says Sandeep Chaudhary of the EBC Bind community. Like most who lost their homes, his family has moved to a bandh (embankment), over a kilometre away. But, like a restless vagabond, he returns to the riverbank every now and then.The embankment is a narrow strip; barely wide enough to set up a tent. To walk to the other side, you gingerly trudge up the slope. The camps are made of canvas and reed. These are survival units where you’ll find sewing machines, gas cylinders, and old trunks kept messily for lack of space. A man sleeps on a charpoy beside a buffalo while a girl pets a rooster on her lap. “I can endure. But my kids haven’t seen hard times. How can they bear all this?,” says a tearyeyed middle-aged woman.In one of the tents, Sandeep’s younger brother, Vijay, is studying mathematics. He is preparing for his Class 12 examinations. They earlier lived in a concrete home with eight rooms. Four of them have fallen into the river, parts of the remaining half hang in the air like a person standing on one leg. Their father, a sharecropper, had toiled all his life to build the house. Scattered school notebooks and a pitch-black hearth tells the story of a hurried evacuation amid a bed of red hibiscus flowers that looks incongruous in these glum surroundings.The family belongings are stored in four places. Some items are with their married sister, who lives about 20km away; the remaining articles are kept either at a temple, or with a friend. Only the bare necessities are at the embankment. Like some others, the Chaudharys are building a reed hut at some distance from the riverbank. “We haven’t left the village. But the village has left us,” says Sandeep.Neeraj’s father, Mangru, is not at home. He is campaigning for the BJP candidate, Rakesh Ojha. So is Pawan Thakur, a bhumihar by caste, who owned 20 bighas of land and is now homeless, landless and jobless. A group of eight men have travelled on motorbikes to a nearby village, where UP deputy CM and BJP leader Keshav Prasad Maurya is addressing an election meeting.A village of yadavs, brahmins, binds, gonds (tribals) and bhumihars, Jawaniya has about 1,500 voters. The Shahpur assembly seat, of which it is a part, has been mostly held by RJD. Two-time MLA Rahul Tiwary is now aiming for a hat-trick. Both candidates have visited Jawaniya.Sentiments, barring those among the yadavs, seem more inclined towards Ojha, described as a “naya yuva chehra (a new youthful face)”. Locals say that he ran a langar (free food service) during the floods. Among others who provided relief materials was Bhojpuri singer-actor Pawan Singh, who distributed 1,500 tents and 2,000 bamboo poles. Jan Suraaj leader Prashant Kishor spent Diwali with the villagers.Nearby villages such as Karja Bazaar were also flooded in July. The waters have receded. But in Jawaniya, they have left behind a sandy bed. Earlier the land, locals say, was fit for wheat, pulses, millets and sesame. “Now we can only grow watermelons,” says Neeraj.Jawaniya is conjoined with another village, Chakki Naurangia, both on the Bihar-Uttar Pradesh border. Homes and lands in both villages have been lost forever. “The district administration ran a flood relief camp for two and a half months. Every family received a gratuity of Rs 7,000,” says Tanai Sultania, DM, Bhojpur, over the phone. It is also learnt that house compensation has been partially disbursed and the villagers are likely to be settled in Bilauti, about 30km away. But several villagers said they haven’t received the compensation yet.Vijay Ram, a Dalit, from Chakki Naurangia, stands staring at the river. Like many others, he has moved to the relief camp. The melancholy of loss, he says, lingers. “This village is my birthplace — I keep coming back,” he explains. Today, he has brought his wife to the riverbank. She wanted to see their ‘home’. He points about 200 metres away. “That’s where it was,” he tells her. There’s nothing there, only a river now at peace with itself.","This July, the primeval Ganga took everything that belonged to this riverine village in Bhojpur district of Bihar.

Killed PIO in Canada as he didn't pay up: Bishnoi gang; brief lockdown in locality after incident,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/killed-pio-in-canada-as-he-didnt-pay-up-bishnoi-gang-brief-lockdown-in-locality-after-incident/articleshow/124925173.cms,"Brief lockdown in Canada locality after PIO killing



NEW DELHI: Mocking Ottawa's decision to designate it a terror group, Lawrence Bishnoi gang has claimed responsibility for Monday's killing of 68-year-old Indian-origin millionaire Canadian businessman Darshan Singh Sahsi. The group said the target refused to pay ""protection money"", reports Rajshekhar Jha.The group has also claimed responsibility for firing at Punjabi singer Channi Nattan's residence in Canada while warning the music industry against working with singer Saradar Khera. It released videos of both shootings.Coming after Canadian authorities designated it a terrorist outfit, the twin incidents signal Bishnoi gang's defiance while underlining both its reach and capability to strike at will in the country.Sahsi was shot dead in his car outside his home in Abbotsford, British Columbia, on Monday morning. He hailed from Ludhiana and was president of Canam International, a leading clothing recycling firm.Goldy Dhillon of the Bishnoi gang claimed responsibility for the murder through a social media post which alleged that Sahsi was involved in a drug-trafficking operation and had been asked for money by the gang, which he refused to pay and even blocked their number.The sensational killing had prompted brief lockdowns of schools in the neighbourhood as the Abbotsford police patrol officers responded to the shooting.In the second incident, the Bishnoi group stated that the attack was carried out because Channi Nattan was reportedly ""developing close ties"" with fellow singer Saradar Khera. Making the claim, Goldy Dhillon also released a video of the firing. ""Sat Sri Akal! I am Goldy Dhillon (Lawrence Bishnoi Gang). Reason for the firing at singer Channi Nattan's house yesterday is Saradar Khera.""The gang issued a warning to the music industry: ""Any singer who works with or maintains a relationship with Saradar Khera will be solely responsible for their own loss. This is because we will continue to inflict significant damage upon Khera.""Canada designating it a 'terrorist entity' was largely seen as a blow to the Bishnoi gang. The move, seen as having been prompted by pressure from the pro-Khalistani groups who have blamed Bishnoi for the assassination of Hardip Singh Nijjar, a terrorist wanted in India, was supposed to enable law enforcement agencies to use significant investigative tools and access the resources needed to disrupt operations of the gang.The terrorist designation also unlocks critical powers, allowing Canadian police to prosecute offences pertaining to financing, travel and recruitment. A terrorist listing means anything owned by that group in Canada - property, vehicles or money - can be frozen or seized.","Lawrence Bishnoi gang claims responsibility for killing of Indian-origin Canadian businessman Darshan Singh Sahsi.

Punjabi-Canadian Businessman Darshan Sahsi Shot Dead Outside Home in Suspected Targeted Killing





NEW DELHI: A chilling video has emerged showing the killing of Darshan Singh Sahsi, a 68-year-old Indian-origin businessman, who was shot dead in his car outside his home in Abbotsford, British Columbia, on Monday morning.The video shows that as unsuspecting Dharshan Singh sits in his car, an assailant quietly tiptoes toward the vehicle on a busy road and opens fire from close range.Sahsi, originally from Ludhiana and the president of Canam International, a well-known clothing recycling firm, was found with fatal gunshot wounds inside his vehicle.Police said the attack was targeted.According to investigators, the shooter lay in wait in a parked car, and as soon as Sahsi entered his vehicle, the assailant opened fire before fleeing the area.A homicide probe is now underway.Soon after the incident, Goldy Dhillon, a close aide of jailed gangster Lawrence Bishnoi , claimed responsibility on social media. Dhillon alleged that Sahsi had refused to pay extortion money demanded by the gang and even blocked their number.The post claimed Sahsi was “involved in drug trafficking” and was “punished” for denying the demand — a claim that police have not verified.The murder comes just weeks after the Canadian government declared the Lawrence Bishnoi syndicate a ‘terrorist entity’, giving law enforcement agencies greater powers to seize assets, track funding, and curb gang operations.Despite the designation, Bishnoi’s gang has continued violent operations in Canada. Dhillon recently took credit for drive-by shootings at multiple locations in Surrey and Maple Ridge, as well as an attack on comedian Kapil Sharma’s café in Canada.Abbotsford Police said they are reviewing the video evidence and working with federal agencies to determine any cross-border links.The Lawrence Bishnoi syndicate claimed responsibility for the killing of a 68-year-old Indian-origin businessman who was shot dead in his car in Canada in a targeted shooting.","Darshan Singh Sahsi, a 68-year-old Indian-origin businessman, was shot dead in his car outside his home in Abbotsford, British Columbia, on Monday morning.

KAKINADA (ANDHRA PRADESH): Cyclonic storm Montha in Bay of Bengal was on Monday headed towards Andhra Pradesh, where it’s expected to cross the coast between Machilipatnam and Kalingapatnam after making a landfall near Kakinada around midnight on Tuesday before moving towards southern Odisha.The season’s first major storm, currently centred over west-central Bay of Bengal and moving northnorthwestward, is expected to intensify into a “severe cyclonic storm” before making landfall with wind speeds of 90-100 kilometres per hour and gusts up to 110 kmph.Andhra Pradesh govt has put the districts of Kakinada, Konaseema, West Godavari, Eluru and East Godavari on high alert.

All fishing boats have been recalled from the sea,” he said.While Andhra Pradesh will bear the brunt of the storm, with red and orange alerts issued for 23 districts, the south-coastal districts of neighbouring Odisha are likely to witness heavy rainfall and strong winds. The northern districts of Tamil Nadu, including Chennai, are expected to receive heavy rains.Meanwhile, in Odisha, the state govt on Monday evacuated 3,000 people from vulnerable areas as the storm triggered rain across Bhubaneswar and southern parts of the state.Among those evacuated are 1,496 women in advanced stages of pregnancy, who have been shifted to hospitals.As many as 140 teams from NDRF, ODRAF and fire services personnel have been deployed, while schools and anganwadi centres have been shut in eight red zone districts till Thursday.Authorities are closely monitoring Gajapati, Rayagada, Koraput and Malkangiri districts for possible landslides.","Andhra Pradesh govt has put the districts of Kakinada, Konaseema, West Godavari, Eluru and EastGodavari on high alert.

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday hinted that Washington could soon reach a trade deal with India, emphasising that the two countries have strong bilateral ties.“If you look at India and Pakistan, so I'm doing a trade deal with India, and I have great respect and love. As you know, for Prime Minister Modi, we have a great relationship,” Trump said while speaking at a luncheon for APEC CEOs.Addressing business leaders, Trump revisited events from earlier this year and claimed he intervened to halt escalating tensions between India and Pakistan.According to him, his refusal to move ahead with a trade deal and the threat of punitive tariffs, prevented what he described as a looming conflict.“And I called Prime Minister Modi. I said, we can't make a trade deal with you. No, no, we must make a trade deal. I said, no, we can't. You're starting a war with Pakistan. We're not going to do it. And then I called Pakistan.”He went on to elaborate that he warned both nations of severe economic consequences if they continued hostilities.“And to be warned for the tariffs, I said I was going to put 250% tariffs on each country, which means that you'll never do business.In other words, there's nothing you can sell for 250%.”He further added, “That means that's a nice way of saying we don't want to do business with you. You don't have to say that because that's a nasty we don't want to do business. You say, we're going to put two hundred and fifty percent tariffs if you don't stop the war.”Trump has repeatedly claimed that his intervention prevented the war, claiming the threat of refusing trade deals forced India and Pakistan to step back.India, however, has maintained that the United States had no involvement in de-escalation efforts. According to New Delhi, the decision to cease hostilities was taken after a request from the Pakistani DGMO to his Indian counterpart.Trade relations between the US and India have been under strain in recent months. Washington imposed an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods in response to India’s continued purchase of Russian oil, arguing that the imports were “helping to power Russia’s war machine.” Now, Indian imports to the US market are now subject to a 50% tariff.Earlier this week, EAM S Jaishankar also had a meeting with US secretary of state Marco Rubio in Kuala Lumpur to discuss international relations and ongoing trade negotiations between their nations.",US President Donald Trump hinted that Washington could soon reach a trade deal with India.

SRINAGAR: J&K CM Omar Abdullah 's National Conference and BJP teamed up in the assembly for the first time Tuesday to vote out PDP 's proposed ""anti-bulldozer bill"" that seeks to grant ownership rights to locals occupying illegal properties on state-owned land for over 20 years.Omar, already facing allegations about last Friday's Rajya Sabha election being ""a fixed match"" after BJP won one of the four seats at stake, received a rare shout-out from the saffron party later for rejecting PDP's land bill ""in national interest"".""How can this bill be justified when it seeks to legitimise illegal constructions on state land?"" Omar said in the House before speaker Abdul Rahim Rather put the bill to vote. ""If it is passed, it would mean that anyone who builds a house on state land tomorrow can claim it as their own. That is simply unacceptable,"" he added.The rebuff came less than a week after PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti declared at a presser that her party had agreed to support NC in the Rajya Sabha election on the condition that the governing party would back its J&K (Regularisation and Recognition of Property Rights of Residents in Public Land) Bill.""BJP's threat to block the passage of PDP's land regularisation (anti-bulldozer) bill, which they branded the 'land jihad bill', was fulfilled today,"" Mehbooba wrote on X after the move was voted out. ""The chief minister, who had earlier assured that any pro-people initiative from PDP would face no obstacles under his leadership, has once again reneged on his word. This marks yet another U-turn added to his growing list of unfulfilled guarantees and promises. ""The draft of the rejected bill defines ""residents"" as those holding permanent resident certificates, which were replaced with domicile certificates after the abrogation of Article 370. PDP projects the bill as one meant to safeguard the rights of J&K residents who are being slapped with eviction notices.CM Omar harked back to the defunct Roshni Act being challenged in court and defeated despite what he said was a well-intentioned move to ""provide relief to people who had acquired legal rights over land"".""Here, this bill is justifying illegal encroachment,"" he said, urging PDP member Waheed Parra to withdraw it immediately.Parra refused to do so, accusing Omar of siding with BJP and against the interest of those living in J&K. ""BJP calls this bill 'land jihad', and now you are backing away from it? You should debate the bill; if there are any loopholes, we can fix them,"" he said.When the PDP legislator told Omar that ""even your relatives have suffered on account of this"", alluding to the controversy surrounding Hotel Nedous in Gulmarg, the CM stood up to clarify that his kin had ""a rightful lease over the land"".""But I will not bring a bill to protect my relatives"" Omar said. ""You are bringing religion and politics into this. You should not compare land for the landless with this bill.""BJP MLA Sunil Sharma applauded and thanked the CM for taking what he said was a decisive step against ""a notorious bill"" to regularise encroachment.

VIJAYAWADA/HYDERABAD: Cyclone Montha weakened into a deep depression Wednesday after leaving a trail of destruction across Andhra and Telangana - from overflowing lakes and collapsed homes to snapped power lines and stranded trains, report Madhu Rasala, Amisha Rajani & Shiva Kumar Pinna.A 90-year-old woman, of Palnadu in Andhra, was killed after a mud wall collapsed amid the downpour, while hundreds were rescued from submerged tunnels, flooded temples, and stranded highways. Montha made landfall Tuesday night near Kakinada between Machilipatnam and Kalingapatnam, packing winds over 100kmph and torrential rain that turned entire stretches of coastal Andhra into an expanse of floodwater and fallen trees.Though the storm spared Kakinada city major damage, high tides battered the Uppada beach road and damaged fisherfolk homes.By Wednesday, Montha weakened over Telangana and moved toward southern Chhattisgarh, but not before drenching the region with record rainfall and paralysing transport.Across Andhra, power lines and transformers collapsed under gusty winds. South Central Railway cancelled 127 trains and diverted 14, while long-distance trains were halted mid-route.Telangana faced the full fury of Montha's rain bands.Dozens of vehicles were left stranded on Hyderabad-Srisailam highway after a portion of the road washed away near Nagarkurnool.Warangal and Hanumakonda districts bore the brunt, with several areas recording over 300mm rainfall - the season's highest in the state. At Warangal's Welfare Degree College for Women, 375 students were trapped for hours before disaster response teams pulled them to safety using ropes and a human chain.","A 90-year-old woman, of Palnadu in Andhra, was killed after a mud wall collapsed amid the downpour.

He called on the MLAs, “especially the ruling party, to unite on this issue and play their role in securing the release and relief of Kashmiri prisoners”.Raising the issue in the House during question hour, CPI-M's M Y Tarigami said, “It is a matter of deep concern that hundreds of Kashmiri prisoners, both young and old, are lodged in different jails across India. Only yesterday, family members of Shabir Ahmad Shah informed me that his health is deteriorating. There are many others in similar condition.“We appeal to the government to take up this issue with the Centre and insist that if these detainees have to remain in custody, they be shifted to jails within Kashmir,” he said, adding there is no dearth of prisons here. “It is a basic human right.”Peoples Conference member Sajad Lone supported the demand and urged the Speaker to ensure that the concern of the House reaches the centre.“I understand they cannot interfere in certain matters, but expressing concern is neither a crime nor against the law,” he said.“Shabir Shah has spent his entire life in jail. He was a political leader. Imagine if any of us were unable to stand without support, how would our families react? There are many such cases, but this one is particularly serious,” Lone said.Shah is currently lodged in Delhi’s Tihar jail. He was arrested by the NIA on June 4, 2019, on charges of terror funding and allegedly indulging in anti-national activities.Lone said while the home dept was under the purview of the central govt, the Assembly must still take cognizance of the deteriorating health conditions of Kashmiri prisoners lodged outside J&K.Meanwhile, outside the House, Mirwaiz said, “Shah Sahib’s wife, in a letter to me, conveyed that their daughter, who visited him in jail, reported that he seems to be dying a silent death due to his fast-deteriorating health and multiple complications with no recourse to urgent care or hospitalisation.”Shah’s daughter met him in jail on Oct 28 and later said he has grown considerably weaker and his haemoglobin has dropped to below 9gm/dl. She said both his feet are swollen, likely due to his persistent and severe prostate issues. He is unable to stand properly, and his hands have begun to tremble, the family said.“The letter urges the authorities to at least shift him home and convert Shah Sahib’s house into a jail so that the family can take care of him and provide him with urgent medical attention, as his health cannot withstand any further delay,” Mirwaiz said.He said Yasin Malik’s mother and sister met him in jail a few days back and conveyed that “prolonged confinement has taken a huge toll on his physical and mental health and that he is also in need of urgent medical care.”“Reports about the worsening health and harsh conditions of other Kashmiri political detainees and youth lodged in various jails within and outside Jammu and Kashmir are equally worrying,” Mirwaiz said.",Jammu and Kashmir Assembly urges government to seek transfer of Kashmiri prisoners.

'NDA Coming To Power With Thumping Majority': Bihar Minister Sanjay Saraogi On Assembly Polls

NEW DELHI: Tejashwi Yadav , Pawan Khera and Dipankar Bhattacharya were present as the Mahagathbandhan unveiled its joint manifesto in Patna for the upcoming Bihar Assembly elections . Yet the spotlight also fell on who wasn’t there — another day marked by Rahul Gandhi ’s absence from the poll-bound state.The document was branded as “Tejashwi’s Prann,” featuring a prominent image of the RJD leader on its cover, with Rahul's small image at the top left — a detail that may hint at the shifting centre of gravity within the alliance.Interestingly, in 2020 the alliance titled its manifesto “Prann Humara,” avoiding any direct association with a specific leader — though Tejashwi’s image still featured on the cover. This time, however, the branding appeared far more pointed.It's been over two months since the poll-bound state got a glimpse of the Congress leader. However, he did make a digital cameo on Monday, as he extended Chhath Pooja greetings flaunting his Bhojpuri skills.""A few days ago, I had a very engaging conversation with the youth of Bihar - on education, health, employment, every issue. And, there is only one culprit responsible for their deplorable state: the BJP-JDU government,"" he said as he shared the video.The grand old party, which had the worst strike rate in the opposition camp in 2020 polls, has assured that Rahul will kickoff the Congress campaign starting October 29 and 30 in the state. Congress fielded candidates in 70 constituencies, the second-highest tally in the opposition bloc after the RJD’s 144, but managed to secure victories in only 19 of them.Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and party president Mallikarjun Kharge would follow suit. Moreover, a joint rally with Tejashwi is also being planned in Muzaffarpur and Darbhanga.Rahul Gandhi's last visit to the state was in August when he conducted 'Voter Adhikar Yatra' for 16 days, during which he covered 1,300km, 110 Assembly constituencies across 25 districts.The march was framed as a moral battle to safeguard the electoral process, urging voters to stand against what he described as “vote chori” by the ruling NDA.","The document was branded as “Tejashwi’s Prann,” featuring a prominent image of the RJD leader on its cover.

Andhra Braces for Cyclone Montha Landfall; IMD Warns of Heavy Rain, Strong Winds

Sea turns violent in Kakinada, floods homes, tears up roads

KAIKNADA/BHUBANESWAR: Cyclone Montha roared ashore on the eastern coast Tuesday night, slamming into Andhra Pradesh between Machilipatnam and Kalingapatnam near Kakinada with winds topping 100km an hour and sheets of rain that ripped through towns, snapped power lines, and sent waves surging 10ft high.The season's first major cyclone made landfall as a severe storm around 7.30pm, its crossing lasting nearly 4 hours. Trees lay strewn across highways, power poles twisted in the wind, and rescue teams battled driving rain to clear the roads. A woman died in Makanapalem village of Mamidikuduru mandal when a tree crashed onto her home.Across the border in Odisha, Montha's outer bands brought torrential rain and winds up to 100kmph through Ganjam and Gajapati districts, blocking roads and toppling trees. No casualties were reported, but landslides cut off stretches of R Udayagiri, Parlakhemundi, Huma, and Kashipur.The sea turned violent at Uppada in Kakinada district, flooding homes and tearing up the coastal road. Police sealed the Kakinada-Uppada beach road after waves breached embankments. As the cyclone's eye passed inland, thousands huddled in shelters, waiting for the storm to pass. Over 10,000 Andhra residents, mostly fishing families, were evacuated from 65 villages in 12 coastal mandals before landfall.Kakinada district collector S Shan Mohan said two NDRF teams and one SDRF unit were in the field, backed by 200 swimmers and 140 boats. ""Helipads have been kept ready to airlift people from submerged areas as and when required,"" he said. More than 12,000 people took shelter in 76 cyclone relief centres. Nearly 1,000 heads of cattle were moved to safer ground.Eight flights were cancelled at Rajahmundry airport, disrupting connections to Tirupati, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Mumbai.In Odisha, state govt opened over 2,000 cyclone shelters and deployed 158 emergency teams - five NDRF, 30 ODRAF, and 123 fire service units - to lead rescue and relief work. CM Mohan Majhi reviewed operations and said that 11,000 vulnerable people had been moved to safety under the ""zero casualty"" mission. ""Another 30,000 could be evacuated if conditions worsen,"" he said.Deputy chief minister KV Singhdeo said crop damage was extensive and promised aid once district reports arrive within a week.IMD director general Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said Montha's impact would linger through Wednesday, bringing heavy to extremely heavy rainfall to southern Odisha before weakening over Chhattisgarh. Wind speeds could reach 80kmph as the system moves inland.Regional IMD chief Manorama Mohanty said rainfall will taper off by Friday, with lingering showers Thursday in interior Odisha.","The season's first major cyclone made landfall as a severe storm around 7.30pm, its crossing lasting nearly 4 hours.

The fatal encounter:

Aftermath:

The bigger picture



Mental health crisis:

Cultural resonance:

The takeaway







When 36-year-old Sonya Massey dialled 911 from her Springfield, Illinois home in July 2024, she wasn’t calling for confrontation — she was calling for help. Minutes later, a white sheriff’s deputy, Sean Grayson, shot her in the head. This week, after more than a year of protests and political fallout, Grayson was convicted of second-degree murder, reigniting a national debate over police accountability and systemic racism in America.A Peoria County jury on Wednesday found former Sangamon County deputy Sean Grayson guilty of second-degree murder for fatally shooting Massey, an unarmed Black woman who had reported a prowler outside her home. The incident was caught partly on body camera footage — though Grayson’s own camera was switched on only after the shooting. He faces up to 20 years in prison, with sentencing set for January 29, 2026.The footage shows Grayson threatening to shoot Massey after she made a religious statement — “I rebuke you in the name of Jesus” — before firing three rounds, one of which struck her in the head.Massey’s killing has become a new flashpoint in America’s long struggle with police violence, echoing the racial trauma of the 2020 killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery.Her death — and the leniency of the verdict — has been denounced by activists and family members as another example of the system’s failure to deliver full justice.Her father, James Wilburn, called the verdict “a miscarriage of justice,” while community groups formed the so-called “Massey Commission” to campaign against racial bias in law enforcement and local governance.The 911 call: Massey reported a suspected prowler at around midnight on July 6, 2024. Two deputies — Grayson and Dawson Farley — arrived and found signs of a car break-in but no intruder.When Grayson noticed a pot boiling on the stove, he told Massey to remove it. As she moved the pot to the sink, he backed away, saying he didn’t want “hot, steaming water” thrown on him. After she uttered a religious rebuke, Grayson drew his gun, threatened her, and fired.Farley tried to render first aid, but Grayson told him not to bother. Massey was pronounced dead soon after.Grayson’s body camera was off during most of the interaction, violating department policy. He activated it only after shooting. Farley’s footage captured the entire episode.Just a day before the shooting, Massey’s mother had called 911 to request help for her daughter, warning that she was in a mental health crisis. That information was never relayed to deputies.: Records show Grayson had two DUI convictions, an Army discharge for misconduct, and a history of erratic behaviour across five police agencies. The case prompted Illinois Governor JB Pritzker to sign a new law mandating deeper background checks in police recruitment.The Sangamon County sheriff who hired Grayson resigned amid public anger.The case has reignited discussions about race, policing, and accountability, testing whether post-Floyd reforms have changed anything substantive.Grayson’s conviction may mark a rare moment of accountability, but the second-degree verdict has left the Massey family and much of America unconvinced that justice was done. For many, her death underscores how little has changed since 2020 — that in moments meant for help, Black Americans still risk being killed for calling 911.","Sonya Massey, 36, was shot dead in her Springfield, Illinois home in July 2024. Former Sangamon County deputy Sean Grayson was found guilty of second-degree murder this week. Massey's death has become a new flashpoint in America’s long struggle with police violence.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124931379,imgsize-28166,width-400,resizemode-4/sonya-massey-in-police-footage.jpg"
US-Canada trade ties: Senate votes to revoke Trump's 10% additional tariffs on Canada; cites harm to 'maine economy',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-canada-trade-ties-senate-votes-to-revoke-trumps-10-additional-tariffs-on-canada-cites-harm-to-maine-economy/articleshow/124928628.cms,"'TERMINATED': Huge Escalation Between Canada & U.S; Trump Retaliates After Carney Junks America





The US Senate has given a major blow to US President Donald Trump’s order to impose additional 10% tariffs on Canada, revoking his authority to impose steep duties on the country.The resolution was passed late Wednesday (local time) with a 50–46 vote, as reported by The Hill. Four Republicans, Susan Collins and Rand Paul of Kentucky, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, voted with Democrats to support the measure.The push to restrict Trump’s tariff powers originally cleared the Senate on April 2 but was blocked when the Republican-led House declined to act on it.Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia, revived the proposal this week, insisting that Trump’s justification for hitting Canada with tariffs does not fall under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.""I primarily object to the Canada tariffs because I don't think there's an emergency that should trigger the use of this statute,"" Kaine said during floor debate. ""The fracturing of this long-standing, powerful relationship [with Canada] is one of the many reasons I oppose them.""Senator Susan Collins has consistently argued that Maine, a state whose economy is tightly linked with Canada, would bear the brunt of the trade measures.""The Maine economy is integrated with Canada, our most important trading partner,"" she said previously, adding that tariffs on petroleum products, paper mills, forest industries and fisheries would harm many families and local economies.Tensions escalated after an advert broadcast during the World Series in Ontario used a clip of former US President Ronald Reagan criticising tariffs. Trump denounced the advert as a ""serious misrepresentation of the facts"" and called it a ""hostile act"", before announcing the additional 10% duties.Wednesday’s voting came immediately after another move by lawmakers to curb Trump’s trade authority, only a day earlier, five Republican senators sided with Democrats on a similar resolution aimed at ending his emergency tariff powers against Brazil.","The US Senate has given a major blow to US President Donald Trump’s order to impose additional 10% tariffs on Canada.

US President Donald Trump declared that he has directed the Department of War to commence testing the nation's nuclear weapons in response to testing programs by ""other countries"".

That process will begin immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter,"" he added.Trump's announcement comes amid Russia testing two nuclear-powered strategic weapons — the 9M730 Burevestnik cruise missile and the Poseidon underwater drone — described by Moscow as capable of carrying nuclear payloads over long ranges.Trump had described the tests as ""inappropriate"" and advised Putin to focus on ending the conflict with Ukraine.""I don't think it's an appropriate thing for Putin to be saying either. By the way, he ought to get the war ended. A war that should have taken one week is now in its fourth year. That's what he ought to do instead of testing missiles,"" Trump said.Putin asserted that the Poseidon is currently unmatched in terms of interception, highlighting its critical role in Russia's defense strategy.

SNAP benefits to end on November 1; air traffic controllers to miss first paychecks — will Trump and Democrats strike a deal to end shutdown?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-shutdown-snap-benefits-to-end-on-november-1-air-traffic-controllers-to-miss-first-paychecks/articleshow/124861067.cms,"'Trump Using Hunger For Bargain': Shockwaves In U.S. Over SNAP Cuts As Shutdown Explodes



Will Medicare and Medicaid be affected by the government shutdown?

US shutdown affects air travel

Will lawmakers make peace for Americans





As the US government shutdown drags into its fourth week, millions of Americans are facing the threat of losing food assistance, and air traffic controllers are preparing to miss their first paychecks.The Department of Agriculture says Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits will stop on November 1, warning that “the well has run dry, ABC news reported.SNAP, commonly known as food stamps, provides support to about 42 million low-income Americans. The program is federally funded but administered by states, meaning the shutdown’s effects will vary across the country.For now, beneficiaries of Medicare and Medicaid should still be able to access medical care without disruption. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) confirmed that both programs will continue operating during the shutdown, with Medicaid funding secured through the end of the year, US Today reported.However, experts caution that prolonged gridlock could cause ripple effects. If the shutdown stretches on, doctors, hospitals, and other health providers may begin to experience delays in reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid — potentially straining operations and patient services over time.Air travel chaos worsened across the US on Monday as the government shutdown entered its 27th day, with more than 5,600 flights delayed nationwide amid a surge in air traffic controller absences.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) blamed staffing shortages for widespread disruptions, implementing ground delay programs at Newark Liberty International in New Jersey, Austin-Bergstrom in Texas, and Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. Earlier in the day, flights in the Southeast were also affected by shortages at the Atlanta Terminal Radar Approach Control.Around 13,000 air traffic controllers and 50,000 Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officers have been working without pay since the shutdown began, after a funding standoff between President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats, as per Reuters.Officials have warned that delays and cancellations could worsen as air traffic controllers miss their first full paycheck on Tuesday. On Sunday alone, more than 8,800 flights were delayed nationwide.Secretary of transport department Sean Duffy said that air traffic controllers will stop getting paid starting October 28.In a post on X, he said, ""Air traffic controllers will stop getting paid starting TOMORROW. This is not ok! I just visited several of them at @goingplacesCLE and they are worried about paying their mortgage. @SenSchumer and @RepJeffriesyou’ve got to do better!""As the shutdown continues to impact Americans and key deadlines loom, all eyes are on Capitol Hill where lawmakers are still in a stalemate.And it seems that President Donald Trump and Democrats are in the negotiating terms, according to the ABC news.Over the weekend, the Trump administration said it will not extend additional funding for SNAP, blaming Democrats for the continued stalemate. The position marks a reversal from a contingency plan published by USDA in September, which suggested that multi-year funds could sustain operations during a shutdown.Democrats are blasting President Donald Trump for refusing to tap into contingency funds to keep food aid flowing during the government shutdown.In a joint statement Friday, Congresswomen Rosa DeLauro and Angie Craig called the move “perhaps the most cruel and unlawful offense the Trump administration has perpetrated yet.”They also accused Trump of misplaced priorities — pointing to his decision to provide financial assistance to Argentina and fund a new White House ballroom even as millions of Americans face losing access to food assistance.","USDA says Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits will stop on November 1.

The accused, Manoj Kumar (32), a martial arts trainer from Kerala, and his wife Aarati Sharma (30)





NEW DELHI: A chilling CCTV footage has emerged showing a Kalaripayattu trainer and his wife deliberately mowing down a 24-year-old food delivery agent in a fit of rage — and returning to the crime scene later to collect broken car parts.Police have arrested Manoj Kumar (32), a martial arts trainer from Kerala, and his wife Aarati Sharma (30), from Jammu & Kashmir, in connection with the October 25 incident that killed Darshan, a resident of Kembattalli.The couple, married for five years, has been remanded to 14-day judicial custody.The CCTV footage, accessed by police from Nataraja Layout in South Bengaluru, has revealed the sequence of events that turned a minor brush on the road into a murder.Also read: Delivery boy chased, crushed after road rage spat; martial arts trainer, wife arrested for murder Around 9pm, Darshan’s gearless scooter accidentally brushed against Kumar’s car, slightly damaging its right-side rear-view mirror. Though Darshan apologised and sped away — as he was on his way to deliver food — Kumar allegedly lost his temper.“Losing control of himself, he took a U-turn, chased the scooter, and rammed it from behind,” said a senior investigating officer. “The impact threw Darshan and his pillion rider Varun onto the road.The car didn’t stop.”Locals rushed the duo to a nearby hospital, where doctors declared Darshan brought dead. His sister later filed a hit-and-run case with JP Nagar traffic police.But when investigators examined the CCTV footage, they were stunned. “To our horror, we discovered it was not an accident. The driver deliberately veered left and rammed into the scooter,” a senior officer said.Further footage showed the same car returning to the accident site around 9.40pm. “The couple, wearing masks, parked nearby and collected parts of their car that had broken off during the impact. As they left again, CCTV cameras captured their faces clearly,” the officer added.The footage helped police identify the car and trace the couple to their residence. Deputy commissioner of police (South) Lokesh Jagalasar confirmed the arrests, saying, “The accused have confessed to their involvement.”While Manoj claimed he was alone during the ramming and that Aarati had only accompanied him later to retrieve the car parts, police said they are verifying his version.Darshan, a bachelor, is survived by his parents and sister. His family is demanding strict action against the accused.","Police have arrested Manoj Kumar (32), a martial arts trainer from Kerala, and his wife Aarati Sharma (30), from Jammu & Kashmir.

The two leaders signed agreements reinforcing their nations' alliance and establishing a framework for securing critical minerals and rare earths.Under the trade deal, Japan pledged to fund $550 billion in US projects in exchange for lowered tariffs on Japanese goods — with imports taxed at 15%.

An interim government led by Muhammad Yunus has ruled Bangladesh since Hasina’s ouster and has promised to hold elections in February 2026.Sitting in the Indian capital, Hasina said she won’t return to Bangladesh under any government formed through elections that exclude her party.Hasina further warned that millions of Awami League supporters would boycott next year’s national election, after the party was barred from contesting the polls.“The ban on the Awami League is not only unjust, it is self-defeating,” she said in emailed responses to Reuters.“The next government must have electoral legitimacy. Millions of people support the Awami League, so as things stand, they will not vote. You cannot disenfranchise millions of people if you want a political system that works,” she added.Once praised for transforming Bangladesh’s economy, Hasina now faces charges of crimes against humanity over a brutal crackdown on student protests in mid-2024.A verdict from the International Crimes Tribunal is expected on November 13, Reuters reported.A United Nations report estimates that up to 1,400 people were killed and thousands more injured, mostly by security forces’ gunfire, during the unrest between July 15 and August 5, marking Bangladesh’s deadliest violence since the 1971 war of independence.“These proceedings are a politically motivated charade,” Hasina said, denying the allegations. “They’ve been brought by kangaroo courts, with guilty verdicts a foregone conclusion. I was mostly denied prior notice or any meaningful opportunity to defend myself,” she added.Despite her exile, Hasina remains hopeful about her party’s future.“It’s really not about me or my family,” she said. “For Bangladesh to achieve the future we all want, there must be a return to constitutional rule and political stability.

What changes from tomorrow?



Major blow to H-4 visa holders ?







As the US administration announced the end of automatic extension of employment authorization starting from October 30, immigration attorneys questioned the move and asked why the new rule was announced without any notice and public comment period.In a Biden-era rule, certain immigrants can keep working legally even after their work permit expires, as long as they have filed a renewal application on time. From tomorrow, there will be no automatic extension, and there will be a fresh screening and vetting of those workers before their work permit is extended. Migrant workers who file to renew their work permit on or after October 30, 2025 will no longer receive an automatic extension.The administration said that this would allow them to deter fraud and detect aliens with potentially harmful intent.Green card holders and H-1B or O-1 visa holders do not need work permits. But the spouses of H-1Bs, the H-4 visa holders, come under the new work permit rule. Immigration experts raised an alarm that under the new rule which allows no automatic extension if the administration takes too long to process the renewal, which now includes fresh vetting, the applicant will lose their work permit.""Another rule imposed immediately without notice and public comment periods because it is somehow an emergency to stop people from working solely because of government ineptitude,"" David J Bier, immigration expert at the Cato Institute, said.""The Trump Administration is removing automatic extensions for Employment Authorization (EADs), a move that will hurt thousands of H-4 visa holders, mostly highly-skilled spouses of legal immigrants,"" Indian-origin investor Sidharth wrote. ""These are law-abiding families already stuck in endless backlogs. Instead of relief, they get anxiety, uncertainty, and job loss. America shouldn’t punish those who followed the law. Radical voices inside this administration are sabotaging the skilled-immigration system, handing talent and innovation leadership straight to China.""""If proper vetting was actually the issue, why has@USCIS been waiting until people renew their EADs to complete a screening? USCIS can review an alien's background at any point. This just harms the people who are actually following the law and are not a security threat. Also, we wouldn't need automatic extensions of EADs if USCIS would just process the application!

Why this matters



The bigger picture

Texas, Missouri, and North Carolina have already passed new GOP-favoured maps.

The National Democratic Redistricting Committee recently donated $150,000 each to gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger and the House Democratic Caucus — contributions Republicans allege are tied to this redistricting push. Ideological echoes: In debate, Democrats invoked Virginia’s founding legacy to “preserve democracy from Trump,” while Republicans warned that aligning with D.C. politics would erode that very legacy.

What’s next







Virginia is entering a new redistricting battle — this time not over where to draw the lines, but who gets to hold the pen.Just days before the November 4 elections, Virginia Democrats unveiled a temporary constitutional amendment that would allow lawmakers to redraw congressional districts mid-decade — but only under limited conditions and only until 2030. They argue it’s a defensive move against a wave of Republican-led redistricting in other states, encouraged by President Donald Trump’s push to expand GOP control of the US House.According to a Washington Post report, the proposed amendment would let the General Assembly redraw congressional maps outside the usual 10-year cycle. The power would only be triggered if other states do the same and would expire at the end of the decade. The bipartisan redistricting commission created by voters in 2020 would remain intact and take over again for the regular 2030 reapportionment.Democratic leaders, including Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell and Sen. Mamie Locke, defended the measure as a limited safeguard for democracy. “At the end of the day, it will be the voters’ decision,” Locke said, stressing that the amendment only gives Virginians the option to act in extraordinary circumstances.The timeline is tight: the amendment must pass the General Assembly twice — before and after this November’s elections — and then win voter approval in a special referendum next year if it’s to be in effect by the 2026 midterms.Governor Glenn Youngkin called the proposal “a shameless 11th-hour political power grab,” accusing Democrats of trying to override the will of voters who approved a bipartisan process just five years ago. Attorney General Jason Miyares issued an advisory opinion supporting that argument, saying it’s too late for any new amendment to be enacted before the 2026 midterms since early voting for this election began in September.Republican lawmakers warned that reopening the process would destroy public trust. “Virginia voters were promised that they’d pick their representatives, not the other way around,” said Sen. William Stanley.If approved, the amendment would represent a major shift in Virginia’s redistricting structure, giving lawmakers emergency powers to redraw maps if they believe other states are skewing representation. Democrats frame it as self-defence; Republicans see it as a partisan end-run around the constitution.The clash underscores how Trump’s second-term politics have reignited state-level fights over democracy, with Virginia — historically a swing state — now pulled into the national redistricting arms race.The House of Delegates and Senate will take up the amendment this week, likely working through Friday — just in time for the final weekend of campaigning.If Democrats maintain control, Virginia voters could face a new referendum by mid-2026 deciding whether to hand lawmakers the map-drawing pencil one more time.In essence: the fight isn’t about geography — it’s about political geography, and who gets to redraw the rules of the game.","The National Democratic Redistricting Committee recently donated $150,000 each to gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger and the House Democratic Caucus.

If approved, the amendment would give lawmakers emergency powers to redraw maps if they believe other states are skewing representation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124932224,imgsize-846424,width-400,resizemode-4/virginia-democrats-will-try-to-reshape-us-house-districts-in-counter-to-trump39s-redistricting-push.jpg"

Yes Minister,

A Legal Defeat Disguised as Continuity



The Bureaucratic Miracle of Staying Put



A California Greek Chorus



The Quiet Lesson







InSir Humphrey Appleby once called responsibility without power the prerogative of the eunuch. Bill Essayli has achieved the opposite: power without responsibility, the prerogative of the Trump era.When a federal judge ruled that Essayli was serving illegally as Los Angeles’ top federal prosecutor, you might have expected him to quietly clear out his desk. Instead, he smiled.“We’re actually quite relieved,” he said, as if judicial censure were a commendation.Because in the absurd machinery of Trump’s Department of Justice, losing your title doesn’t mean losing control. Essayli has been told he cannot call himself acting US attorney. But he can keep acting as one. The nameplate goes; the power stays.The ruling by Judge J. Michael Seabright, a George W. Bush appointee who clearly values nuance over finality, found that Attorney General Pam Bondi had violated appointment law when she extended Essayli’s 120-day interim term. But in the same judgment, he confirmed that Essayli could remain in charge as the office’s “top deputy.”It’s a demotion so delicate it changes nothing. The DOJ gets to keep its man in place, and the courts get to claim they upheld the law.Everyone wins, except perhaps the idea of legality.There’s a certain genius to how the Trump administration manages continuity through chaos. Bondi’s tenure has been marked by these constitutional gymnastics, finding new ways to keep loyalists in posts the Senate won’t confirm.The Central District’s judges could technically appoint someone else to lead the office. They haven’t. They probably won’t. Because this is how inertia becomes policy. In the absence of enforcement, illegality simply becomes a management style.Essayli understands that perfectly. “Ultimately, that’s quibbling about a title, not authority,” he said. Which is the whole point of power—it doesn’t need to be called anything to exist.Democrats in California are, predictably, outraged. Adam Schiff, who has long served as both Trump’s favourite target and moral counterweight, called Essayli’s continued service illegitimate. State assemblyman Mark González declared that any case involving “illegal ICE raids” should be tossed out.But these protests are largely symbolic. They rage against an architecture that’s built to absorb outrage and outlast it. Essayli’s office keeps humming. The indictments keep coming. And somewhere in Washington, Pam Bondi is smiling at her own administrative alchemy.If Yes Minister taught us that bureaucracy survives by deflecting blame, Trump’s Washington has perfected the inverse—wielding power without ever needing to justify it.Bill Essayli isn’t a rogue; he’s a symptom. A product of a government that governs by reinterpretation, not rule. Where judges scold but do not remove, and where authority seeps through the cracks of accountability like water through marble.Sir Humphrey would have admired it. He had once joked that responsibility without power was the prerogative of the eunuch. In 2025, Bill Essayli has demonstrated the opposite: power without responsibility, the prerogative of the loyalist.","Bill Essayli has been told he cannot call himself acting US attorney.

NEW DELHI: A city court convicted a 16-year-old teen, who was being tried as an adult, for the rape and murder of a 60-year-old woman in 2017, reports Vineet Upadhyay.Taking note of the post-mortem report, additional sessions judge Amit Sahrawat said Tuesday that the juvenile did not just deliver blows with an iron rod on the victim's body, but also ""mercilessly inserted this rod into the private parts of the woman, causing fatal injuries"".He said there was no doubt about the boy's intention to cause death.In 2018, the juvenile justice board said teen was to be tried as an adult, following which the case was transferred to a Pocso court.According to the prosecution, the juvenile struck the woman with the rod and then attempted to rape her on Nov 11, 2017. It said that a security guard, on witnessing the crime, raised an alarm, following which the juvenile was apprehended.Underlining that according to the law, if any object was inserted to any extent into the vagina, urethra, or anus of a woman, then it amounted to rape, the judge said that even if there is no confirmation from the security guard's testimony regarding penile rape, the act of inserting the rod into the private parts of the deceased amounts to rape.","Teen tried as adult, convicted for brutal Delhi rape-murder of 60-year-old.

Brazil's Deadliest Raid On Notorious Criminals; 60+ Killed In Rio, 2500 Cops Deployed | WATCH

How it unfolded









At least 132 people were killed in what authorities described as Brazil’s largest police operation against drug gangs, officials said on Wednesday. In Rio de Janeiro, residents lined a street with dozens of bodies recovered overnight following the raids.The bodies of the men were placed in a single row along the pavement of a square on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro. Residents said many were stripped to their underwear to help relatives identify them, while others were covered with bedsheets.Brazil's state police said the raids, aimed at dismantling a major drug gang, had been planned over two months and were intended to force suspects into a forested hillside, where a special operations unit was positioned to intercept them.“The elevated lethality of the operation was expected but not desired,” Victor Santos, Rio state’s head of security, said at a news conference, as cited by Reuters. He added that authorities would investigate any instances of police “misconduct.”Residents of Rio’s Penha neighborhood collected dozens of bodies from the surrounding forest overnight and placed more than 70 of them along the center of a main street.“More bodies kept coming,” Rene Silva, a community leader from the neighborhood where the raids took place, was quoted as saying by the New York Times. He estimated that volunteers recovered between 50 and 60 bodies through the night. “Mothers, wives, children were there, crying,” Silva added.Uncertainty remained over how the large-scale operation unfolded and whether civilians were among the victims. An official later acknowledged that the operation had not achieved its primary goal of capturing a top gang leader.President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva reportedly dispatched a ministerial committee to Rio de Janeiro on Wednesday and pledged federal support for the forensic investigation.""We cannot accept that organized crime continues to destroy families, oppress residents, and spread drugs and violence throughout the cities,"" Lula said through a post on X.Rio state governor Cláudio Castro described the raids as a ""success"", as he cited the arrests of 113 alleged members of the Red Command gang, along with the seizure of 118 weapons and a considerable amount of drugs.Castro said the operation was intended to curb the Red Command’s growing influence and prevent the gang from expanding its control over larger parts of the city.The latest raids marked the deadliest police operation in Brazil’s history. The previous highest death toll was recorded in 2021, when 28 people were killed during a police anti-drug raid in Rio’s Jacarezinho neighborhood.","At least 132 people were killed in what authorities described as Brazil’s largest police operation against drug gangs.

‘Don’t BOMB…’: US Ally ROARS As Trump’s Forces Knock Out ‘Narco Boats’ In Back-To-Back Strikes





US defense secretary Pete Hegseth said on Thursday that the US military carried out another strike on a boat in the eastern Pacific Ocean. According to Hegseth, the boat was carrying drugs, and all four people on board were killed.The action is part of the Trump administration’s ongoing campaign against drug cartels operating in waters near South America.Hegseth, who is currently visiting Japan and Malaysia, posted on social media that intelligence showed the boat was “transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics.” He said the strike took place in international waters and that no US personnel were injured.Hegseth also shared a video that shows a boat exploding. This was the 14th strike since the campaign began in early September. The total number of people killed in these operations has reached at least 61, news agency Associated Press reported.The Trump administration has deployed a large number of US Navy ships, including vessels carrying Marines and aircraft, to the region. The scale of the deployment has led to speculation that the US may be preparing actions aimed at Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, whom the US has accused of narcoterrorism.American President Donald Trump has said the attacks on suspected drug boats are necessary to stop the flow of illegal drugs into the US. He has said the US is in an “armed conflict” with drug cartels, citing the same legal authority that allowed the George W Bush administration to launch military action after the September 11 attacks.As the number of strikes increases, members of Congress have raised concerns about presidential authority. The operations have been conducted without a formal declaration of war or legal review. Some lawmakers have questioned the lack of evidence to justify the use of lethal force.So far, the administration has not provided proof to support its assertions about the boats, their links to drug cartels, or the identity of the people killed.","US defense secretary Pete Hegseth said on Thursday that the US military carried out another strike on a boat in the eastern Pacific Ocean.

Top doctor reveals why Trump suddenly got an MRI scan: 'Undisclosed medical problems...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/top-doctor-reveals-why-trump-suddenly-got-an-mri-scan-undisclosed-medical-problems-/articleshow/124858277.cms,"Trump Slips Up, Admits MRI At Walter Reed In Latest 'Routine Physical' Checkup At Medical Centre

The consultation



'Perfect' results



No MRI without a clear reason



Medications







A top American cardiologist has suggested that President Donald Trump may have quietly undergone an MRI scan due to potential neurological or cardiovascular symptoms.Dr Jonathan Reiner is a professor of medicine at George Washington University. He is also a former cardiologist to ex-vice president Dick Cheney.Reiner told CNN that MRIs are never performed as part of a routine check-up, implying that Trump’s test was probably forced due to symptoms.“Typically, they’re prompted by symptoms,” Reiner explained. “They can be neurologic symptoms that prompt an MRI. They could be back pain that prompts an MRI. There can be issues with the heart that would prompt an MRI. And for those reasons, the public should really be told, you know, why did the president undergo the test, what consultants he saw, and what was the result of the testing?”79-year-old Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that he had received an MRI, calling the results “perfect.” When asked about why the scan was done, he redirected questions to his doctors and added, “I gave you the full results. We had an MRI… you know the whole thing. And it was perfect.”The White House has not disclosed the reason for the MRI, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt describing it as part of a “routine health check.” However, Reiner strongly disagreed, saying, “An MRI is never part of a routine evaluation, whether you’re president of the United States or whether you’re just a civilian.”Public health physician Dr Vin Gupta supported Reiner’s statement, writing on X, “Even if you are leader of the free world, you don’t just get an MRI without a clear reason to do so. There’s no such thing as a ‘screening’ MRI.”Concerns about Trump’s health have grown in recent months after several public appearances showed him with visible bruises on his hands and a noticeably uneven gait. At times, he appeared slower on his feet and struggled with short-term recollection.The White House announced in July that Trump suffers from chronic venous insufficiency, a condition in which veins struggle to send blood from the legs back to the heart. Reiner suggested that Trump’s visible bruising and cankles might be linked to blood-thinning medication, which is commonly prescribed for cardiovascular issues.“There are a lot of things that can do that,” Reiner said. “The most common cause for bruising in the back of a 79-year-old person’s hand is medications. And the typical medication that causes that would be a blood thinner.”He added that people usually take such drugs with conditions like pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, or atrial fibrillation. “People who take blood thinners for atrial fibrillation typically are on them indefinitely, and the side effects of medications like that are bruising,” Reiner said.He concluded that the key question is not just what the MRI showed, but why it was ordered. “Why he would have an MRI depends on the underlying reason for either that medication or other undisclosed medical problems. It is just as important why he had the test as what the test showed.”","Dr Jonathan Reiner is a professor of medicine at George Washington University.

Storm devastates Jamaica: Hurricane Hunters film inside eye of Category 5 Melissa — Watch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/storm-devastates-jamaica-hurricane-hunters-film-inside-eye-of-category-5-melissa-watch/articleshow/124864582.cms,"Hurricane Melissa Turns Into STRONGEST STORM On Earth This Year; Jamaica, Cuba ‘On Knees’

Jamaica braces for its strongest storm in 174 years

Cuba and the Bahamas next in line





Jaw-dropping videos shot from inside the eye of Category 5 Hurricane Melissa have stunned viewers across the world, offering a rare glimpse of nature’s fury at its most extreme. One clip, recorded by a US Air Force “Hurricane Hunter” crew, shows the so-called “stadium effect” — towering clouds curving around a calm blue centre — as the aircraft cuts through the storm’s core.The footage, filmed on multiple passes through Melissa, quickly went viral. “Third pass through Melissa. GoPro in side window as different camera looking forward shooting in ultra high res 8K,” wrote pilot and storm chaser @FlynonymousWX, who shared the video on X. He described the mission as “very powerful but relatively straightforward” compared to earlier flights that faced intense turbulence and “nasty meso activity. ”The US Air Force Reserve’s 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, based at Keesler Air Force Base in Mississippi, is the only operational unit in the world to routinely fly into hurricanes. The team, known as the “Hurricane Hunters,” collects vital data for the U.S. National Hurricane Center to forecast the storm’s strength and path.Hurricane Melissa made landfall in Jamaica early Tuesday, bringing winds of up to 175 mph (282 km/h) and torrential rain.The U.S. National Hurricane Center warned of “catastrophic and life-threatening” flooding, landslides and storm surges reaching up to 13 feet along the southern coast.Prime Minister Andrew Holness described the hurricane as the island’s most violent in recorded history, saying: “There is no infrastructure in the region that can withstand a Category 5. The question now is the speed of recovery — that’s the challenge.”Despite evacuation orders, many residents chose to remain in their homes. “I’m not moving. I don’t believe I can run from death,” said Roy Brown, a plumber in Kingston’s Port Royal district. Others cited poor conditions in public shelters. “I have no choice but to be here,” said Sandra Walker, a vendor in St Elizabeth, who feared losing her livelihood.Officials reported landslides, widespread power cuts, and at least three storm-related deaths. “It’s nothing to play with,” warned Environment Minister Matthew Samuda, urging Jamaicans to stay indoors.After battering Jamaica, Melissa is expected to move north towards Cuba late Tuesday before crossing the Bahamas. Cuban authorities began evacuating more than 600,000 people from coastal regions, including the eastern provinces of Santiago de Cuba and Guantánamo, amid fears of severe flooding and a storm surge up to 20 inches high.The storm has already claimed at least seven lives across the Caribbean — three in Jamaica, three in Haiti, and one in the Dominican Republic — and displaced thousands. In Haiti, officials reported crop destruction and flooding in multiple provinces, worsening the country’s hunger crisis.Meteorologists warn that Melissa’s slow speed could amplify destruction, as its rains linger over affected areas. “Water kills a lot more people than wind,” said climate scientist Kerry Emanuel, adding that human-driven warming is making such rapid intensification events more frequent.As Jamaican authorities prepare for what could be the strongest storm since records began 174 years ago, Prime Minister Holness urged calm but vigilance: “You have been warned. It’s now up to you to make the right decision.”","Hurricane Melissa made landfall in Jamaica early Tuesday, bringing winds of up to 175 mph (282 km/h) and torrential rain.

US President Donald Trump and China’s leader Xi Jinping met in Busan, South Korea, on Thursday, holding their first face-to-face talks in six years as both sides sought to ease a trade war that has shaken global markets. The meeting, taking place on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in nearby Gyeongju, aimed to stabilise relations between the world’s two largest economies after months of tariff disputes and supply chain disruptions.Greeting Xi on the red carpet, Trump said, “Good to see you again,” adding that the Chinese leader was “a very tough negotiator.” Predicting a “fantastic relationship for a long period of time,” he added, “We’ll have a great understanding.” Xi, speaking through a translator, responded that while China and the United States “do not always see eye to eye, this is normal,” stressing that both countries “should be partners and friends. ” He continued: “China and the US can jointly shoulder our responsibility as major countries and work together to accomplish more great and concrete things for the good of our two countries and the whole world.”Xi, speaking through a translator, struck a conciliatory tone, saying that while the US and China “do not always see eye to eye, this is normal”, adding that it was “normal for economies to have frictions”.He emphasised that the two nations “should be partners and friends” and that China’s development “goes hand in hand with the vision to make America great again”.Minutes before the talks, Trump made headlines by announcing on Truth Social that he had ordered the Pentagon to begin nuclear weapons testing “on an equal basis” with China and Russia, declaring that Beijing was a “distant third” in nuclear capability but “will be even in five years.” The unexpected statement raised the stakes for the Busan meeting, which Trump nonetheless described as the “G2,” reflecting both nations’ global standing.Flanking Trump were senior officials including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury chief Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Xi’s delegation included Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Commerce Minister Wang Wentao and Vice Premier He Lifeng.The discussions followed weeks of preparatory negotiations and are expected to produce a preliminary trade framework. Trump indicated that the agreement could see the United States lower 20 per cent tariffs on Chinese goods related to fentanyl in exchange for stronger Chinese cooperation on the drug, which has devastated American communities. Washington also hopes Beijing will resume large-scale purchases of US soybeans and delay recently announced export controls on rare earths—materials vital to high-tech manufacturing.Erly concessions may include reducing port fees and fentanyl-related tariffs, while China could boost imports of American commodities to signal goodwill. For Trump, success in Busan would mark a major diplomatic achievement on his Asia tour, which has included meetings with regional leaders and enthusiastic receptions in Tokyo and Seoul.","US President Donald Trump and China’s leader Xi Jinping met in Busan, South Korea, on Thursday.

PHILADELPHIA: After waiting more than four decades to clear his name in a friend's 1980 killing, India-born Subramanyam Vedam was set to walk free from a Pennsylvania prison this month. Vedam and Thomas Kinser were the 19-year-old children of Penn State University faculty. Vedam was the last person seen with Kinser and was twice convicted of killing him, despite a lack of witnesses or motive. In Aug, a judge threw out the conviction after Vedam's lawyers found new ballistics evidence that prosecutors had never disclosed.As his sister prepared to bring him home on Oct 3, the thin, white-haired Vedam was instead taken into federal custody over a 1999 deportation order. The 64-year-old, who legally came to the US from India when he was 9 months old, now faces another daunting legal fight.Amid the Trump Administration's focus on mass deportation, Vedam's lawyers must persuade an immigration court that a 1980s drug conviction should be outweighed by the years he wrongly spent in prison. For a time, immigration law allowed people who had reformed their lives to seek such waivers. Vedam never pursued it then because of the murder conviction.""He has suffered a profound injustice,"" said immigration lawyer Ava Benach. ""(And) those 43 years aren't a blank slate. He lived a remarkable experience in prison.""Vedam earned several degrees behind bars, tutored hundreds of fellow inmates and went nearly half a century with just a single infraction, involving rice brought in from the outside.His lawyers hope immigration judges will consider the totality of his case. The administration, in a brief filed Friday, opposes the effort. So Vedam remains at an 1,800-bed US immigration and customs enforcement facility in central Pennsylvania. ""Criminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the US,"" a department of homeland security spokesperson said in an email about the case.After his initial conviction was thrown out, Vedam faced an unusual set of questions at his 1988 retrial. ""Vedam, where were you born?"" centre county district attorney Ray Gricar asked. ""How frequently would you go back to India? ""During your teenage years, did you ever meditate?"" Gopal Balachandran, the Penn State law professor who won the reversal, believes the questions were designed to alienate him from the all-white jury, which returned a second guilty verdict.The Vedams were among the first Indian families in the area known as ""Happy Valley,"" where his father had come as a postdoctoral fellow in 1956. An older daughter was born in State College, but ""Subu,"" as he was known, was born when the family was back in India in 1961. They returned to State College before his first birthday.While she left for college in Massachusetts, Subu became swept up in the counterculture of the 1970s, growing his hair long and dabbling in drugs while taking classes at Penn State. One day in Dec 1980, Vedem asked Kinser for a ride to nearby Lewisburg to buy drugs. Kinser was never seen again, although his van was found outside his apartment. Nine months later, hikers found his body in a wooded area miles away.Vedam was detained on drug charges while police investigated, and was ultimately charged with murder. He was convicted in 1983 and sentenced to life without parole. To resolve the drug case, he pleaded no contest to four counts of selling LSD and a theft charge. The 1988 retrial offered no reprieve from his situation.Although the defence long questioned the ballistics evidence in the case, the jury, which heard that Vedam had bought a .25-caliber gun from someone, never heard that an FBI report suggested the bullet wound was too small to have been fired from that gun. After hearings on the issue, a centre county judge threw out the conviction and the district attorney decided this month not to retry the case. Trump officials oppose the petition.Vedam could spend several more months in custody before the board of immigration appeals decides whether to reopen the case. Saraswathi Vedam is saddened by the latest delay, but said her brother remains patient. ""He knows that sometimes things don't make sense,"" she said. ""You have to just stay with stay the course and keep hoping that truth will win.""","India-born Subramanyam Vedam was set to walk free from a Pennsylvania prison this month.
