MEERUT: Sambhal district administration on Wednesday began excavating a centuries-old well located 50m from the Mughal-era Shahi Jama Masjid in Chandausi town . The digging is part of a broader initiative to revive historical wells and pilgrimage sites across the city.Sambhal DM Rajender Pensiya told TOI, “A total of 19 wells are mentioned in the history of Sambhal district, and we have so far managed to identify 17. Over decades, these wells were sealed off and encroached upon. The well adjacent to Jama Masjid was also encroached and a cemented platform was built over it. Nine more wells were found separately during the search, making a total of 28 wells found so far, including 19 Mahakoops and 87 pilgrimage sites. The sites have been freed from encroachment . This action is being taken after receiving a complaint letter from local residents.”Sambhal SP Krishan Kumar Bishnoi said, “Adequate security measures have been taken and an additional superintendent of police, along with a police force and personnel from provincial armed constabulary, was present during excavation . Law and order situation is stable.”The excavation effort comes after residents highlighted the condition of wells, many of which were encroached upon or neglected over the years. Authorities are focused on restoring thehistorical structures and ensuring their preservation.ASP Shreesh Chandra said, “Legal action will follow after further investigation. According to local accounts and elderly residents, this well has existed for centuries. Further verification will be done as the excavation progresses.”Sanjay Kumar, a resident, said, “This well is situated near the Harihar temple. It used to be a place of worship where people came during auspicious occasions like childbirth or weddings. Over time, it was covered and its original form altered. The excavation will restore its historic appearance.”Shahi Jama Masjid has been at the centre of recent tensions in Sambhal. On Nov 19, a court-ordered survey began to investigate claims the mosque was built over a demolished Hindu temple. The second inspection on Nov 24 led to clashes, resulting in five deaths. Following this, SC directed that no action be taken regarding a private well located near the mosque’s entrance without its permission.","The digging is part of a broader initiative to revive historical wells and pilgrimage sites across Sambhal.

Similar accident claimed 22 lives in Mumbai 31 years ago

NAHSIK: It was smoke that perhaps sparked rumours of a fire, which caused panicked passengers to jump out of Pushpak Express, only to be crushed under the wheels of the oncoming Karnataka Express on the adjoining track, said survivors and passengers of the Lucknow-Mumbai train who were witness to the tragedy that took place near Pachora station in Maharashtra’s Jalgaon district.The unreserved coaches of the train were packed to the hilt, and chaos ensued as soon as the train stopped. Jagmohan Paswan, a 48-year-old survivor, said: “There were many vendors in our coach. One of them shouted that a fire had broken out in a coach. Seconds later, the train stopped and everyone came rushing to squeeze out of the two doors. My relative, Uttam Paswan, too, jumped out and sustained head & leg injuries.”Paswan said those killed and injured had jumped out of the door on the right side of the coach. Uttam was among them, but survived, he said, adding those who exited from the left door, including himself, were unharmed.Sanjeev Singh, who was on his way to Shirdi, said: “We were sitting when suddenly people started screaming about a fire. There was some smoke emanating, but not from a fire. However, this caused chaos, and a few seconds later, the train pulled to a stop. I went to the door and saw people jumping out and coming under the train on the next track. I saw eight to ten bodies on the other track.”“Our coach was intact and people in AC coaches were mostly safe. I am not sure if the smoke was from pantry or braking,” he said.Md Mulin (42), whose relative Md Bilal sustained injuries in the right leg, said there was hardly any space in the coach they were travelling in. “Even the doors were blocked by passengers standing there. Suddenly, everyone rushed towards the doors.” Recounting the heart-rending sight before him on jumping out, he said: “I saw dismembered bodies on the adjacent track. I will not forget what I witnessed.”According to some survivors, the loco pilot of Karnataka Express stopped the train after seeing passengers from Pushpak Express jumping out. Had it not stopped, the toll would have been higher, they said. Residents of Pachora town and villages near the accident site reached the spot to help.The Jalgaon tragedy revives the painful memory of a similar accident in which 21 women and a boy lost their lives in Mumbai’s Goregaon. Tragedy struck at 7.14 pm on Oct 13, 1993, when passengers on Western Railway’s ‘ladies special’ local between Borivli and Kandivli jumped off a first class compartment on to the tracks after seeing smoke rise from the undercarriage of their stationary train, unaware that the Borivli-Churchgate local was hurtling towards them.Heavy showers, accompanied by thunder and lightning, added to the panic and chaos, and they were run over. Apower cut hampered rescue operations. The fire alarm was later found to be false.","Survivors and passengers of the Lucknow-Mumbai train who were witness to the tragedy.

‘Some passengers pulled chain suspecting fire’

NASHIK: At least 12 passengers of Lucknow-Mumbai Pushpak Express lost their lives and 15 others were injured in an accident Wednesday evening in north Maharashtra’s Jalgaon district. They jumped from their train following rumours of a fire in one of the compartments, only to be hit by Bengaluru-New Delhi Karnataka Express coming from the opposite direction and negotiating a curve on the adjacent tracks.An official said the driver of Pushpak Express had turned on the flasher light after the train halted due to the alarm chain being pulled. The Karnataka Express driver applied brakes upon noticing the light, but a track curvature near the spot hindered visibility.“The curvature of almost two degrees obstructed visibility and reduced the distance for the drivers to apply brakes. The passengers also could not see the approaching train because of the curvature. The drivers tried their best to avert the accident,” the official said.Witnesses described scenes of chaos as people on the tracks desperately tried to move away, but many were unable to escape before the oncoming train struck them. Railways has ordered an investigation.Among the fatalities, three were women. “Fifteen passengers were injured, four of them seriously,” Jalgaon DC Ayush Prasad said. Authorities have released the names of seven deceased identified so far: Nandaram Vishwakarma (10), Lacchi Paasi (18-20 years), Kamla Bhandari (43) — all from Nepal — Imtiyaz Ali (35), Javkala Jaygaddi (50), Nasiruddin Siddiqui (18-20), & Babu Khan (27-30).The accident occurred around 4.50 pm, about 10km from Pachora station. Central Railway chief PRO Swapneel Nila said: “Suspecting a fire in one of the coaches, some passengers in general compartment pulled the chain. Panicked, some of them jumped off the train and fell on adjoining tracks.” Witnesses reported hearing a loud noise and seeing smoke before panic ensued. “There was a rumour that the train was on fire. Passengers who jumped through the right side of the compartment were run over by Karnataka Exp,” a witness said.Maharashtra govt and railway ministry announced ex gratia of Rs 5 lakh and Rs 1.5 lakh, respectively, for the families of the deceased. CM Devendra Fadnavis expressed his condolences. “Deeply saddened by the tragic loss of lives… The district administration, in close coordination with the railway authorities, is ensuring swift action for the treatment of the injured,” he added.PM Modi wrote on X, “Anguished by the tragic accident on the railway tracks in Jalgaon, Maharashtra.

Royal Navy Rushes

NEW DELHI: The Trump administration on Wednesday cancelled travel plans for thousands of refugees who had already been approved to resettle in the United States.This decision stems from President Donald Trump’s executive order suspending refugee admissions, showcasing the immediate and far-reaching impact of the policy. Approximately 10,000 refugees, who had already completed a lengthy and arduous vetting process, now face uncertainty after their scheduled flights were cancelled.“All previously scheduled travel of refugees to the United States is being cancelled, and no new travel bookings will be made. RSCs should not request travel for any additional refugee cases at this time,” stated a State Department memo, as cited by CNN.The move has created significant challenges for those whose medical exams or security clearances are nearing expiration, potentially forcing them to restart the exhaustive process, CNN reported.The memo also outlined a suspension of all case processing and pre-departure activities, effectively halting the US refugee resettlement program . “Additionally, all refugee case processing and pre-departure activities are also suspended. RSCs and IOM should not move refugees to transit centers in anticipation of travel and should halt all pre-departure activities for refugee cases. No new referrals should be made into the USRAP,” it added.However, exceptions have been made for Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) holders, such as those who worked for the US abroad, allowing them to travel. Refugees already within the United States will also continue to receive support services.A subsequent email reviewed by The Associated Press further confirmed that “refugee arrival to the United States has been suspended until further notice.” This statement has dashed hopes for refugees who had completed the approval process and booked flights prior to the executive order’s enforcement deadline.Among those particularly impacted are over 1,600 Afghans who were cleared for resettlement under a program initiated after the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. This group includes individuals who worked alongside American troops during the war, as well as family members of active-duty US military personnel.Initially, Trump’s order had set January 27 as the deadline to halt processing and travel, but the timing appears to have been accelerated. The reason behind this sudden change remains unclear.It is important to note that refugees differ from asylum seekers who arrive directly at the US-Mexico border to seek protection. Refugees must be living outside the United States to qualify for resettlement and are typically referred to the State Department by the United Nations.Refugees undergo rigorous screening processes before being granted entry into the US. Once they arrive, they are matched with resettlement agencies that assist them in adapting to life in the country, including finding employment and enrolling their children in school.The suspension has sparked widespread criticism from human rights groups and refugee advocates, highlighting the humanitarian toll of the Trump administration’s policy changes.","Around 10,000 refugees, who had already completed a lengthy and arduous vetting process, now face uncertainty after their scheduled flights were cancelled. exceptions have been made for Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) holders, such as those who worked for the US abroad.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117461974,imgsize-440544,width-400,resizemode-4/117461974.jpg"

It was not easy for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to hide their feelings as thousands of cameras flashed on them as Donald Trump was sworn in as the 47th president of the United States after a bitterly fought election. Donald Trump had to fight both of them as Joe Biden was initially the presidential candidate until he was forced t0 bow out in favor of Kamala Harris. Trump debated both of them in two presidential debates in the blitzkrieg campaign.Biden and Kamala Harris, however, showed courtesy as they handed over the power to Donald Trump and JD Vance, respectively. Biden in fact greeted Donald Trump saying 'Welcome home'.Body language experts, however, decoded what they were suppressing as Donald Trump took the oath. Expert Susan Constantine told Newsweek that Kamala Harris' face was tense as she seemed uncomfortable. ""The body language between Trump, Harris, and Biden was contentious, stonewalling one another intentionally not to acknowledge or show respect through eye contact, eyebrow glance, or handshake,"" Constantine said.""Harris's face was tense, as she seemed uncomfortable, and she was leaning away from Biden. She appeared to hug the chair to create further distance between her and Biden. Biden appeared lost in space,"" the expert said adding that Kamala Harris displayed visible signs of deep emotion throughout the inauguration. She took a deep breath and looked tense.Body language expert Blanca Cobb noted that during Donald Trump's inauguration speech, Biden and Harris did not clap. ""Their body language spoke volumes: Harris maintained a sharp, unwavering stare, her arms crossed on her lap, a posture that conveyed disapproval and restrained tension. Meanwhile, Biden's subtle smirk added a layer of quiet disagreement,"" he said.According to a lip reader, Barack Obama asked George W Bush how they could ""stop what's happening"" during the inauguration. Lip reader Jackie Gonzalez interpreted that Obama greeted Bush and said, ""Good to see you"". Obama then turned to the crowd thanking them for the cheers and asked Bush, ""How can we stop what's happening?""There was another viral moment from the inauguration when Donald Trump's son Barron Trump leaned towards Joe Biden after a handshake. Forensic lip reader Jeremy Freeman said he believes Biden said, ""It's good to see you man"" to which Barron said, ""Exactly"".","Body language experts have decoded the body language of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris at the inauguration event of Donald Trump.

US Birthright Citizenship Lawsuit: First lawsuit filed in US district court contesting end to citizenship by birth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/first-lawsuit-filed-in-us-district-court-contesting-end-to-citizenship-by-birth/articleshow/117421279.cms,"Poll What’s Your Biggest Concern About the Recent Executive Order? Legal Challenges and Constitutionality Impact on Legal Immigrants

Even as the ink is perhaps drying on the Executive Order (EO) signed by President Donald Trump, immigrants'-rights advocates have sued the Trump administration.The EO - Protecting the meaning and value of American citizenship,’ denies, automatic citizenship to children born in the US after February 19, in the following instances where: The mother is 'unlawfully present' in the US and the father is not a US citizen or lawful permanent resident (aka green card holder) at the time of the child’s birth; and The mother is 'lawfully but temporarily in the US' (on visa) and the father is neither a US citizen or green card holder at the time of the child’s birth. In other words one of the parents has to be a US citizen or green card holder at the time of the child's birth.The first lawsuit challenging this EO has already been filed in a US district court (District of New Hampshire). The case was filed by immigrants' rights advocates including the American Civil Liberties Union, Asian Law Caucus, State Democracy Defenders Fund, and others. The lawsuit charges the Trump administration with flouting the Constitution’s dictates, congressional intent, and longstanding Supreme Court precedent.According to the plaintiffs, birthright citizenship is the principle that every baby born in the US is an American citizen. The Constitution’s 14th Amendment guarantees the citizenship of all children born in the US (with the extremely narrow exception of children of foreign diplomats) regardless of race, colour, or ancestry. Specifically, it states that “All persons born or naturalized in the US, and ‘subject to the jurisdiction’ thereof, are citizens of the US and of the state wherein they reside.”“Denying citizenship to US-born children is not only unconstitutional — it’s also a reckless and ruthless repudiation of American values. Birthright citizenship is part of what makes the United States the strong and dynamic nation that it is. This order seeks to repeat one of the gravest errors in American history, by creating a permanent subclass of people born in the US who are denied full rights as Americans. We will not let this attack on newborns and future generations of Americans go unchallenged. The Trump administration's overreach is so egregious that we are confident we will ultimately prevail,” said Anthony D. Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union.Trump’s executive order points out that the 14th Amendment has never been interpreted to extend citizenship universally to everyone born within the US. It has always excluded from birthright citizenship persons who were born in the US but not ‘subject to the jurisdiction thereof.’ In other words, it requires one of the parents to be a US green card holder or US citizen for the child to get birthright citizenship.“If you’re born here, you are a citizen — period. No politician, including President Trump, can decide who is American and who is not,” said Aarti Kohli, executive director of the Asian Law Caucus.“For over a century, since a young Chinese American cook from San Francisco named Wong Kim Ark won his case at the Supreme Court in 1898, birthright citizenship for all — including babies born to immigrants — has been a cornerstone of US democracy. This constitutional protection has been especially vital to Asian American communities, who have faced decades of exclusionary laws. Most Americans’ whose ancestors came after 1898 built their families’ futures on this very right. Wong Kim Ark’s legacy lives on in every child born to immigrant parents today, and we stand ready to mount a formidable response to any attempt to strip away this essential freedom.”Jacksonville based, Ashwin Sharma, an immigration attorney, told TOI, “The phrase ‘subject to the jurisdiction thereof’ has been consistently interpreted to include nearly all individuals born on US soil, irrespective of their parents’ immigration status, other than children of enemy occupiers or diplomats.“Trump’s EO relies on a selective and self-serving reinterpretation of ‘subject to the jurisdiction thereof.’ The sweeping language of the executive order excludes from eligibility the children of undocumented immigrants as well as children of legal non-immigrants, such as H-1B visa holders, F-1 students, and other temporary residents. By placing the citizenship of these US-born children in jeopardy, the EO creates great uncertainty for immigrant families who have long contributed to the US economy and society. And for a President who claims to champion merit and hard work, this order is a harsh blow to those who exemplify those very ideals.”“Birthright citizenship is guaranteed in our Constitution and is absolutely central to what America stands for,” said Cody Wofsy, deputy director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project and lead attorney in this case. “Denying citizenship to babies born on US soil is illegal, profoundly cruel, and contrary to our values as a country.”Rajiv S Khanna, managing attorney at Immigration.com summed up, ""The EO is most certainly going to be challenged on constitutional grounds. It is at its weakest when it announces that even children born in the US to parents who are in the United States legally, albeit temporarily, will not be considered US citizens. At issue is the constitutional language 'under the jurisdiction of'. It is both legally impossible and commonsensically ludicrous to claim that a person in the US, who is accountable for disobeying the laws of the US is not under the jurisdiction of the United States.Such children would also be unable to obtain required identification and, as they grow up, be denied the right to vote, serve on juries, hold certain jobs, and otherwise be a full member of American society, even though they were born in the US and have never lived anywhere else.","Immigrants'-rights advocates have sued the Trump administration.

Birthright Citizenship: Why Indian-American Usha Vance cannot lose her US citizenship,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-indian-american-usha-vance-cannot-lose-her-us-citizenship/articleshow/117430904.cms,"Vice President-elect JD Vance's wife, Usha Vance, listens as her husband speaks during a dinner event at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, Saturday, Jan. 18, 2025.

“Among the categories of individuals born in the United States and not subject to the jurisdiction thereof, the privilege of United States citizenship does not automatically extend to persons born in the United States: (1) when that person’s mother was unlawfully present in the United States and the father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person’s birth, or (2) when that person’s mother’s presence in the United States at the time of said person’s birth was lawful but temporary (such as, but not limited to, visiting the United States under the auspices of the Visa Waiver Program or visiting on a student, work, or tourist visa) and the father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person’s birth.”

How new Trump order affects the Indian diaspora

Usha Vance defends husband’s resurfaced ‘childless cat lady’ comment as ‘quip’

On Tuesday, a Twitter handle claimed that JD Vance’s wife Usha Vance would lose her citizenship since her parents weren’t US citizens at the time of her birth. The theory comes after Donald Trump’s recent order in which he would overturn years of jus soli (birthright by soil) citizenship for children born to illegal immigrants or when the person’s mother was “lawful but temporary”.Usha Vance's parents, Krish and Lakshmi Chilukuri, immigrated to the United States from Andhra Pradesh, India, in the 1980s. However, publicly available information does not specify the exact date when they became US citizens. Both have established successful careers in the U.S.; Krish Chilukuri is an aerospace engineer and lecturer at San Diego State University, and Lakshmi Chilukuri is a biologist and provost at the University of California, San Diego.The actual order read:Would this make Usha Vance, the first Indian-American Second Lady’s citizenship void? Well, not quite, since the order is only valid for those born within the US after 30 days from the date of the order. Ergo, there’s no way Usha Vance will lose her citizenship under the current Trump executive order.However, things aren't that rosy for many members of the diaspora.The order, which ends automatic birthright citizenship for children of certain legal non-immigrant visa holders, has left many families shocked. This significant shift in US immigration policy targets children born to individuals on temporary visas, such as H-1B work visas, H-4 dependent visas, or F-1 student visas, if at least one parent is not a green card holder or US citizen.Also read:This decision directly impacts over one million Indians awaiting employment-based green cards, many of whom face decades-long backlogs. Previously, these families relied on the assurance that children born in the US would automatically gain citizenship, providing a pathway to later sponsor their parents. With this change, those children must either self-deport upon turning 21 or seek another visa status. Immigration attorneys argue this interpretation contradicts the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to nearly all individuals born on US soil, barring exceptions like children of diplomats.The move has already prompted lawsuits from organisations like the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and immigration attorneys, challenging the EO's constitutionality. Legal experts, including Cyrus Mehta and Greg Siskind, predict the case will reach the Supreme Court, where a conservative majority may uphold Trump's interpretation. The EO asserts that the phrase ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"" excludes individuals born to temporary visa holders, a claim heavily disputed by immigration advocates. They argue this interpretation deviates from established precedents, such as the Supreme Court ruling that granted citizenship to a child born to Chinese immigrants who were not US citizens.The order also underscores potential gender biases, explicitly mentioning ""mother"" and ""father"" roles, which critics view as an outdated perspective. Moreover, the ripple effects are significant: Indian families, already grappling with lengthy green card queues, now face additional uncertainty regarding their children’s futures.The policy shift has fuelled polarising opinions. While some applaud the decision as a step towards stricter immigration control, others criticise it as a punitive measure targeting law-abiding immigrants. Amidst this controversy, the fate of affected families and the legal battle over the EO’s validity hang in the balance, with far-reaching implications for US immigration policy and the interpretation of the 14th Amendment.","Usha Vance's parents, Krish and Lakshmi Chilukuri, immigrated to the United States from Andhra Pradesh, India, in the 1980s.

Taking about the LA wildfire, Trump criticised Gavin Newsom for failing to handle the wildfires in California and said, ""Gavin's got one thing he can do. He can release the water that comes from the north.""

He further slammed (Federal Emergency Management Agency FEMA), and vows to fix disaster response, ""FEMA is getting in the way of everything. On Friday, I’m stopping in North Carolina because those people were treated very badly, then I’m going to California.""

“I’d rather see the states take care of their own problems,” Trump said.

“I love Oklahoma. But you know what, if they get hit with a tornado or something, let Oklahoma fix it. And then the federal government can help them out with the money. FEMA is getting in the way of everything, and the Democrats actually used FEMA not to help North Carolina,"" he added.

Trump also hit out at Democrats and said they, ""can’t govern, and their policies are terrible. They don’t want to see a woman get pummeled by a man boxing. They don’t want a child to leave home as a boy and come back later as a girl.""

""Is it that important for China to be spying on young kids watching crazy videos? They make your computers, and your telephones, and other things. Isn’t that a bigger threat?,"" said Trump on TikTok.

During the discussion, Trump expressed regret, saying that it is ""sad"" that his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, did not issue a self-pardon. Trump said Biden made a huge mistake not pardoning himself hinting at going after him. ""This guy went around giving everybody pardons, and you know, the funny thing, maybe the sad thing, is he didn’t give himself a pardon.""

""We have terrorists in our country by the thousands.. We’re going to take care of it.""

""A gross miscarriage of common sense"", said Trump on Biden’s border crisis. ""21 million people let in—a large percentage are criminals. Prisons from all over the world have been emptied into our country by Biden,"" he added.

In his first interview after taking the Oval Office for the second time, US President Donald Trump on Wednesday talked on various topics ranging from TikTok to Los Angeles wildfires.While talking about getting back into the White House, the US president told Fox News' Sean Hannity, ""It showed us that the radical left, their philosophies and policies, are horrible. They don't work.""When asked if he ever had doubts about winning the US election (held last year), he said, ""It's something I don't think about. I just do it — I get it done. I get things done.

""We trust Trump and believe that he will promote construction in the region in the coming month.""The newly renamed 4,000-acre zone, previously known as E1 or Mevaseret Adumim, lies within Ma’ale Adumim’s municipal boundaries and is part of Area C, where Israel exercises full administrative and security control.Plans to build more than 3,000 homes in the area, aimed at addressing housing shortages, have been delayed for years due to international opposition, including resistance from the Biden administration.Mayor Yifrach pointed out the strategic importance of the area, now called T1, and urged Israeli leaders to create territorial continuity between Ma’ale Adumim and Jerusalem.This is not the first time Israel has honoured Trump. In 2019, after Trump recognised Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights , a new community in the region was named “Ramat Trump” in his honour.Israeli leaders have also applauded Trump’s recent policy shifts, including executive orders reversing sanctions imposed during the Biden administration on residents of Judea and Samaria accused of violence against Palestinians.Other moves include cutting funds to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and re-imposing sanctions on officials of the International Criminal Court.","Ma'ale Adumim, as Israeli town in Judea, announced on Wednesday that a significant area of municipal land has been renamed ""Trump One"" (T1) in honour of US President Donald Trump.

Major threat to life

Disrupted travel

The US Gulf Coast was wrapped in a historic winter storm that swept across Tuesday, bringing record-breaking snowfall to a region, which is usually sun soaked. The storm that stretched 1,500 miles from Texas to the Carolinas, left behind widespread travel chaos, stranded bikers, and thousands of cancelled flights.The snowy chaos has resulted in deadly conditions across the region with at least 11 casualties, as per news agency CNN.Many places in New Orleans received 25 centimeters, surpassing its record of 6.8 centimeters from 1963, the national weather service reported. There was also an unofficial report of 11.5 inches of snow in Saint Bernard Parish east of the city.The small town of Milton near Florida received 24.9 centimeters of snowfall, smashing the state's lifetime record from 1954, according to news agency AP.Houston city of Texas, experienced an unexpected snowfall of 10 centimetres, leaving the city unprepared being the region owning no snowplows. Furthermore, a preliminary report recorded 15 centimetres (6 inches) of snow in La Porte, southeast of Houston.Charleston experienced over 10 centimetres of snowfall, leading to closing the airport and the iconic Ravenel Bridge. Authorities explained the bridge was shut down due to ice forming on its cables, which could break off in large chunks and potentially damage vehicles.Mobile Regional Airport recorded 15.7 centimetres of snow, surpassing the city's previous one-day record of 12.7 centimetres set on 24 January 1881.Unofficial reports also noted over 23 centimetres of snow in Gulf Coast communities near Mobile. In southern Alabama, the small town of Babbie also reported a preliminary snowfall total of 28 centimetres, marking one of the highest.Fatal car accidents due to icy roads have been reported in Texas and Alabama. In Texas’ Zavala County, five people died after their vehicle skidded on a bridge, while in Alabama, another woman died in a collision on a snow-covered highway.Hypothermia is also suspected in several deaths, including one in Milwaukee and another in Georgia.The cold snap has further raised challenges for the homeless. In San Antonio, a woman was seen seeking refuge in their dog kennel, while New Orleans opened an additional warming centre after existing shelters reached capacity.Houston also reported over 1,300 people using warming centres, with officials ensuring no one was turned away.Air travel across the country was disrupted, with more than 1,800 cancelled flights.Airports in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Florida were forced to shut down, while others, like New Orleans’ Louis Armstrong Airport, cancelled all departing flights.Road conditions also remained hazardous in the regions. Louisiana shut down a 150-mile stretch of Interstate 10, and New Orleans brought in snow ploughs from Indiana to clear critical routes. In Alabama and Mississippi, roads were labeled “impassable,” where black ice remained a major threat.The NBA and multiple college basketball conferences also postponed games in response to winter weather.","The storm that stretched 1,500 miles from Texas to the Carolinas, left behind widespread travel chaos, stranded bikers, and thousands of cancelled flights.

"'Can't whitewash blood, feces, and terror': Judge on Trump's pardons for capitol rioters",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cant-whitewash-blood-feces-and-terror-judge-on-trumps-pardons-for-capitol-rioters/articleshow/117472275.cms,"Capitol riot on January 6, 2020 (File photo)

Three federal judges on Wednesday delivered strong rebukes against US President Donald Trump's mass pardons of supporters, who stormed the Capitol Hill on January 6, 2021. The pardons, issued on Trump's first day back in office, have drawn criticism from several quarters.Trump, sworn in Monday after his re-election victory, pardoned over 1,500 individuals linked to the attack on the Capitol, including 14 members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers militia. The riot aimed to disrupt the certification of Joe Biden's 2020 presidential win.District Judge Tanya Chutkan dismissed charges against one Capitol riot defendant but issued a scathing statement. “No pardon can change the tragic truth of what happened on January 6, 2021,” Chutkan said. “It cannot whitewash the blood, feces, and terror that the mob left in its wake. And it cannot repair the jagged breach in America’s sacred tradition of peacefully transitioning power.”Chutkan also presided over the criminal case brought against Trump by special counsel Jack Smith, accusing Trump of attempting to overturn the 2020 election results.However, the case was dismissed after Trump's election victory, aligning with the Justice Department's policy against prosecuting sitting presidents.Two other federal judges similarly condemned the pardons. District Judge Beryl Howell dismissed charges against two defendants but expressed her disapproval of the reasoning behind the pardons. “No ‘national injustice’ occurred here, just as no outcome-determinative election fraud occurred in the 2020 presidential election,” Howell said.She added, “Poor losers cannot be allowed to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power with impunity. That merely raises the dangerous specter of future lawless conduct by other poor losers and undermines the rule of law.”District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly also criticised the pardons while dismissing charges. “What occurred that day is preserved for the future through thousands of contemporaneous videos, transcripts of trials, jury verdicts, and judicial opinions,” she said. “Those records are immutable and represent the truth, no matter how the events of January 6 are described by those charged or their allies.”The January 6 attack left more than 140 police officers injured as rioters, armed with flagpoles, bats, Tasers, and bear spray, stormed the Capitol. During his campaign, Trump had pledged to pardon those involved, describing them as “patriots” and “political prisoners.”Trump has repeatedly downplayed the violence of the Capitol attack, once calling it a “day of love.” The attack followed a speech by Trump to his supporters near the White House, where he repeated false claims of election fraud and encouraged them to march on Congress.","Three federal judges delivered strong rebukes against US President Donald Trump's mass pardons of supporters.

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump on Wednesday indicated that additional sanctions on Russia could be on the table if Russian President Vladimir Putin does not agree to negotiate an end to the ongoing war in Ukraine.Trump in a post on X said that, ""I'm not looking to hurt Russia. I love the Russian people, and always had a very good relationship with President Putin - and this despite the Radical Left's Russia, Russia, Russia HOAX. We must never forget that Russia helped us win the Second World War, losing almost 60,000,000 lives in the process. All of that being said, I'm going to do Russia, whose Economy is failing, and President Putin, a very big FAVOR. Settle now, and STOP this ridiculous War! IT'S ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE.""He added, ""If we don't make a ""deal,"" and soon, I have no other choice but to put high levels of Taxes, Tariffs, and Sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States, and various other participating countries. Let's get this war, which never would have started if I were President, over with! We can do it the easy way, or the hard way - and the easy way is always better. It's time to ""MAKE A DEAL."" NO MORE LIVES SHOULD BE LOST!!!""Earlier this week, Trump urged Putin to strike a deal to end the nearly three-year-long war, warning of dire consequences for Russia if the conflict continues. ""He should make a deal. I think he's destroying Russia by not making a deal,"" Trump said upon returning to the Oval Office. ""I think Russia's going to be in big trouble.""The US president also expressed his willingness to meet Putin, recalling their past summit during his first term. ""I got along with him great. I would hope he wants to make a deal,"" Trump added.Trump referenced conversations with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who reportedly expressed support for a peace agreement to end the war, which began with Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. ""Most people thought that war would have been over in one week,"" Trump remarked. ""I think he’d be very well off to end that war.""Meanwhile, Putin indicated his readiness for dialogue with the new US administration, stating on Monday that Russia remains open to negotiations on the Ukrainian conflict. In televised remarks, Putin emphasised the need for a sustainable resolution. ""As for the settlement of the situation itself, I want to emphasise that its goal should not be a brief truce but a lasting peace based on respect for the legitimate interests of all people,"" he said, while congratulating Trump on his upcoming inauguration.Reiterating his commitment to Russian interests, Putin stated, ""We will, of course, fight for the interests of Russia, for the interests of the Russian people."" He also welcomed Trump's determination to prevent the Ukraine war from escalating into ""World War III,"" a scenario the US president warned about during his campaign.Both leaders have signaled openness to addressing the conflict, with Trump repeatedly highlighting his ability to mediate and describing the war as ""dying to be settled."" Putin acknowledged this stance, expressing hope that Trump's approach could lead to progress.","US President Donald Trump indicated that additional sanctions on Russia could be on the table if Russian President Vladimir Putin does not agree to negotiate an end to the ongoing war in Ukraine.

US President Donald Trump has ordered the deployment of an additional 1,500 military personnel to the border with Mexico as part of a series of measures to address immigration, according to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.This deployment will increase the total number of active-duty troops at the border to approximately 4,000, with border security being a top priority for the president since declaring a national emergency at the US-Mexico border on his first day in office.The reinforcements comprise 1,000 Army personnel and 500 Marines, according to a senior US military official at the Pentagon, as reported by AFP. The Marines, previously designated for California wildfire support but not utilised, have been reassigned to the border operation.""These forces will work on the placement of physical barriers and other border missions. First operations for them should commence within the next 24 to 48 hours; they're moving right now,"" the senior military official said.The official also anticipates the deployment of additional airborne intelligence, surveillance, and support assets to enhance situational awareness at the border. Acting defense secretary Robert Salesses stated that the US military will assist with flights to deport migrants out of the country.""The department will provide military airlift to support DHS (Department of Homeland Security) deportation flights of more than five thousand illegal aliens from the San Diego, California, and El Paso, Texas sectors,"" Salesses said in a statement.The senior military official confirmed that the deportation effort will involve approximately 100 US military personnel. The deployment of additional troops is considered an initial effort, with many additional missions expected to follow, according to a senior defense official.From Day 1 in office, Trump has remained firm with crackdown on illegal immigration. Trump has claimed that he's fine with legal immigrants but soon after he took office, an app that streamlined the legal process was shut down.

Efforts under way

Trump faces criticism

A fresh wildfire broke out north of Los Angeles on Wednesday, rapidly growing and prompting evacuation orders for tens of thousands of residents in an area already struggling with massive fire damage.According to official, over 50,000 people are under evacuation orders or warnings from the fire burning north of Los Angeles.Near Castaic Lake, intense flames consumed hillsides, quickly spreading across more than 5,000 acres (2,000 hectares) within hours. Strong, dry Santa Ana winds propelled the fire, pushing smoke and dangerous embers ahead of the flames. Authorities ordered 31,000 people to evacuate around the lake, situated 35 miles (56 kilometres) north of Los Angeles, near Santa Clarita.""I'm just praying that our house doesn't burn down,"" one resident told broadcaster KTLA whilst loading his vehicle.The incident occurred whilst the greater Los Angeles area was still recovering from two massive fires that claimed over two dozen lives and destroyed numerous structures.Robert Jensen from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's department urged immediate evacuation for all residents in the affected area of the new fire, called the Hughes Fire . ""We've seen the devastation caused by people failing to follow those orders in the Palisades and Eaton fires,"" he said. ""I don't want to see that here in our community as well. If you've been issued an evacuation order, please get out.""Police were observed driving through neighbourhoods instructing residents to evacuate.Sheriff Robert Luna confirmed the evacuation of Pitchess Detention Centre in Castaic, with 500 inmates being transferred to a nearby facility. Approximately 4,600 inmates at other local jails were sheltering in place, with transport ready if needed.Melissa Camacho, an ACLU attorney, expressed concern about ""the expansion of the jail system especially in dangerous fire zones,"" saying they were ""gravely concerned for the safety of people incarcerated in those jails.""The fire affected I5 freeway traffic, causing the closure of a section of this major West Coast route. Aerial firefighting efforts included water and retardant drops from helicopters, planes, and two Super Scoopers.Ground crews from Los Angeles County fire department and Angeles National Forest joined the firefighting effort.Governor Gavin Newsom , previously criticised by President Donald Trump over Los Angeles fire management, announced state resource deployment to assist federal response to the Hughes Fire.The fire's cause remained unknown, but it started during red flag conditions, characterised by strong winds and low humidity conducive to rapid fire spread.Human-induced climate change, including unrestricted fossil fuel use, is altering global temperatures and weather patterns. Despite being in the rainy season, Southern California had experienced no significant rainfall for about eight months, leaving vegetation extremely dry.","A fresh wildfire broke out north of Los Angeles on Wednesday, rapidly growing and prompting evacuation orders for tens of thousands of residents.

House passes Laken Riley Act in move targeting illegal immigrants – Trump set to sign marking first major act of second term,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/house-passes-laken-riley-act-targeting-immigrant-detention-set-to-become-trumps-first-signed-bill-in-second-term/articleshow/117471010.cms,"Representative image

The House of Representatives, under Republican leadership, approved the Laken Riley Act on Wednesday, a stringent immigration detention law named after a 22-year-old nursing student from Georgia who was killed by an undocumented immigrant in the previous year.The bill, which focuses on detaining individuals illegally present in the US who commit nonviolent offences such as theft, is set to become the first legislation President Donald Trump will sign upon his return to the White House this week.The legislation passed with a 263-156 vote, gaining support from 46 Democrats alongside all Republican members. Earlier in the week, the Senate approved it 64-35, with 12 Democrats voting in favour, including Sens. Gary Peters, Jon Ossoff, Jeanne Shaheen, and Mark Warner, who face re-election in 2026.In November, Jose Ibarra, a 26-year-old Venezuelan citizen who was in the United States illegally, was found guilty of kidnapping, assaulting, and murdering Riley while she was jogging near the University of Georgia campus in Athens. Ibarra received a life sentence without the possibility of parole.During the 2024 campaign, Trump and Republicans emphasised that Ibarra had been cited for shoplifting by a Georgia police department, but Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) did not issue a detainer for him, and he was not taken into custody.The Laken Riley Act, authored by Rep. Mike Collins (R-Ga.), would require ICE to take custody of and detain undocumented immigrants who are charged, arrested, or convicted of committing acts of ""burglary, theft, larceny, or shoplifting.""""It's bittersweet,"" Collins said after the vote, adding that he had spoken to Riley's family earlier in the day. ""For a young lady that wanted to dedicate her career and her life to saving lives, now her name will live on forever and it will save lives.""Last year, the GOP-controlled House passed an earlier version of the bill with a vote of 264-159, including support from 48 Democrats. However, the Democratic-led Senate ignored the bill, and President Joe Biden never indicated whether he supported it.The Senate adopted two amendments to expand the list of acts that trigger mandatory detention of unauthorized migrants: one from Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) that includes assault of a police officer, and another from Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) that includes acts causing death or bodily harm to an individual.The passage of the Laken Riley Act occurs amidst a heated debate among Democrats about how to address immigration issues following their significant defeat in the 2024 election and how to respond to Trump's plans for mass deportation.Pro-immigration activists have criticized the bill as a scheme to strip away due process for migrants and disrupt the system, while some Democrats have called it an unfunded mandate that will cost billions. Other Democrats in competitive districts and states supported the bill, seeking to demonstrate their commitment to strict immigration enforcement.According to NBC News exit polls, immigration was the fourth-biggest concern among voters in the 2024 election, with those Americans voting for Trump over Democratic rival Kamala Harris by a margin of 89% to 9%. Trump also made significant gains among Latino voters and won Latino men outright, according to exit polls.House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.) addressed the divide within the party over the bill, stating, ""Members will vote their districts. Members have to balance ... their love for this country with the job that they have to do for their constituents. We expect them to do both in the votes that they make.""""The Democratic Caucus believes in a safe and secure border,"" Aguilar continued. ""We believe in order at the border and a fix to our broken immigration system. We also believe in ensuring the public safety of our communities.""Democrats who opposed the Laken Riley Act argued that the legislation was too draconian. Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-NY), the new chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, told NBC News, ""Laken Riley casts out a net to cuff, arrest and deport people who have committed minor offenses. In that sense, it is not a good thing."" ""Any discussion that should be had here around the issue of border security, around the issue of immigration,"" he said, ""should include something on Dreamers, farm workers and families.""In an interview with NBC News, Laken Riley's father, Jason Riley, expressed gratitude for the lawmakers who supported the legislation, which he believed has ""helped change things politically.""""I think it turned out to be a good thing,"" he said Wednesday. He added that he hates that her killing ""became such a national story"" and put the family in the spotlight, but that he understood ""why it became so politically charged.""""We're very happy with the way things have turned out,"" he said.","The Laken Riley Act is a stringent immigration detention law named after a 22-year-old nursing student from Georgia who was killed by an undocumented immigrant in the previous year.

Scaramucci joked that Vivek Ramaswamy's tenure can't be measured in 'Scaramuccis' which stands for 11 days after his infamous exit in Donald Trump's first term. By removing himself from co-leading the DOGE the night before Trump could officially create it on inauguration day, Ramaswamy lasted minus one day, even shorter than him, Scaramucci said on Politico's PowerPlay podcast.“Ramaswamy lasted minus one day, OK? He got blown out on Jan. 19, so he’s not even—you can’t even measure him by Scaramuccis, which are 11-day time units."" Scaramucci was fired by Trump as White House director after a week and a half but Scaramucci used that fame to appear on media regularly and then he created a super PAC that supported Joe Biden in 2020.“You know, like Liz Truss lasted 4.1 Scaramuccis, right? This guy didn’t even make it, right? He was minus a day,"" Scaramucci said referring to former British PM who remained the PM for only 49 days.Scaramuccia's joke is part of an intense debate going on inside and outside MAGA circles about what went wrong with Vivek Ramaswamy that he attended DOGE's all-hands meeting on Saturday but was out of the agency a day later. The decision was not announced until Donald Trump's inauguration where Ramaswamy posted a photo with Elon Musk -- the man believed to be the force behind Ramaswamy's exit.After Trump's inauguration, Ramaswamy said he would soon announce more about his upcoming role in Ohio -- the governor election in 2026, and also expressed confidence in Elon Musk's leadership for DOGE.According to insiders, Vivek Ramaswamy's long post in which he denigrated the American culture for worshipping mediocrity sealed his exit from DOGE as Republicans did not like Vivek's sermonizing about American culture. Everyone wanted him out and then he also burned Elon Musk, insiders claimed that initially Vivek Ramaswamy was looking to contest for Ohio Governor simultaneously with his DOGE role but Elon Musk objected to it.",Anthony Scaramucci joked that Vivek Ramaswamy's tenure can't be measured in 'Scaramuccis' which stands for 11 days after his infamous exit in Donald Trump's first term.

What did the bishop say with Donald Trump in the audience?

Democratic Bishop Marian Budde who came under fire after lecturing President Donald Trump at the National Prayer Service defended her speech and said she was just trying to say the truth while Donald Trump politicized her statement. The Episcopal bishop of DC turned her speech into a rant about illegal migrants, refugees and the LGBTQ community. Donald Trump sought an apology from her as he called her a radical left hard line Trump hater.“The so-called Bishop who spoke at the National Prayer Service on Tuesday morning was a Radical Left hard line Trump hater,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “She brought her church into the World of politics in a very ungracious way,” he said — saying she did so in a “nasty” tone that was “not compelling or smart.”Referring to the bishop's 'have mercy' on immigrant families appeal, Trump said the bishop failed to mention the large number of illegal migrants that came into the US and killed people. “She is not very good at her job! She and her church owe the public an apology!” he wrote.Reacting to the controversy, the bishop said her message was politicized but it was kind of a given that her message would be politicized, she said. ""I think if you read what I said, I mean how could it not be politicized, right? We are in a hyper-political climate. One of the things I caution about is the culture of contempt in which we live that immediately rushes to the worst possible interpretations of what people are saying and to put them in categories. That's part of the air we breathe now,"" the bishop said.""I was trying to speak a truth that I felt needed to be said but to do it in a respectful and kind way as I could,"" she said.""You have felt the providential hand of a loving God. In the name of our God, I ask you to have mercy upon the people in our country who are scared now,"" Budde said in a direct appeal to Trump. In her sermon, Budde said they gathered ""to pray for unity as a people and a nation - not for agreement, political or otherwise - but for the kind of unity that fosters community across diversity and division.""","Democratic Bishop Marian Budde defended her speech and said she was just trying to say the truth while Donald Trump politicized her statement.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan-occupied Kashmir 's president Sultan Mehmood Chaudhry has invited Chinese businesses to invest heavily in the disputed region, state media reported on Wednesday after the director of China's Yunnan Sunny Road and Bridge Company met him in Muzaffarabad the previous day to discuss ""massive opportunities"" across sectors.Li Ping, whose company specialises in building tunnels and highways, purportedly briefed Chaudhry on a blueprint for multiple projects in PoK.The duo also spoke about the region's tourism potential and abundance of natural resources, including precious stones like rubies and other minerals, Associated Press of Pakistan said.Beijing has already pledged investments in PoK under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) initiative, including the Karot and Kohala hydropower projects, the construction of the M-4 motorway, and a special economic zone in Mirpur.India, which claims PoK and Gilgit-Baltistan as part of its territory, views the CPEC projects as an infringement. The Pakistani and Chinese govts dismiss India's concerns as misplaced.

China-Built Gwadar International Airport Opens for Operations in Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/china-built-airport-in-paks-gwadar-starts-operations/articleshow/117407210.cms,"File photo

ISLAMABAD: The first commercial flight landed at Pakistan’s new Gwadar International Airport on Monday following a months-long delay in the opening of the Beijing-funded facility in volatile Balochistan province.The airport’s opening was postponed from Aug 14 to the end of 2024 due to a security review sparked by a series of deadly attacks by separatist militants in Balochistan, in Pakistan’s southwest. Then, on Jan 10, the airport was due to open, but this was again delayed.“The $246-million Chinese-backed project is expected to grow into one of Pakistan’s biggest airports and serve both domestic and international travel,” the Pakistan Aviation Authority (PAA) said in a statement.“Pakistan achieved a landmark moment in its aviation history on Monday as the first commercial flight successfully landed at the new Gwadar International Airport,” the statement read, adding the new airport is poised to play a pivotal role in connecting Pakistan to global markets and facilitating trade, tourism, and economic development.PIA Flight PK-503 departed from Karachi at 9.50 am and touched down at the airport at 11.15 am, carrying 46 passengers. In a video shared by PAA, the PIA flight was seen being greeted by a traditional water salute by water bowsers as it landed.China has pledged more than $65 billion for infrastructure, energy, and other projects in Pakistan under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ). As part of President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Pakistan is also creating a deep-water port near the new Gwadar airport, a joint venture between Pakistan, Oman, and China that is nearing completion. Chinese people and projects have been frequently attacked in the past by separatists who view Beijing as a foreign invader trying to gain control of impoverished but mineral-rich Balochistan, the site of a decades-long insurgency.Recent attacks, including one in Oct 2024 in which two Chinese workers were killed in a suicide bombing in Karachi, have forced Beijing to publicly criticise Pakistan for security lapses. In recent months, the media has widely reported that China wants its own security forces on the ground to protect its nationals and projects, a demand Islamabad has long resisted.","PIA Flight PK-503 departed from Karachi at 9.50 am and touched down at the airport at 11.15 am, carrying 46 passengers.

Pak authorities demolish pre-Partition Ahmadi worship place,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pak-authorities-demolish-pre-partition-ahmadi-worship-place/articleshow/117361970.cms,"File photo

ISLAMABAD: A pre-Partition place of worship of the minority Ahmadi community was completely demolished by the local administration in Punjab’s Sialkot district, Pakistani media reported on Saturday.The place was built by Chaudhry Zafarullah Khan , Pakistan’s first foreign minister and an Ahmadi by faith, in his native town of Daska, Sialkot. A renowned lawyer in British India, he was a crucial champion for the Ahmadi cause in significant trials.This historical structure was razed on Jan 16, two days after local authorities claimed that an extension of the structure was illegal as it encroached 13 feet onto a public road, a claim rejected by community members.Despite this, Amir Mahmood, spokesperson for the marginalised community, said they had complied with the govt notice and a wall was constructed on the inner side on Jan 15, but the area’s assistant commissioner, accompanied by police, proceeded with the demolition the next day and flattened the entire structure. “It is clear that using the illegal encroachments as an excuse, the administration targeted and demolished the Ahmadi community’s place of worship,” Mahmood said, adding the structure had not been altered or extended since its original construction by Khan’s family before Partition. He blamed the local administration for continuously targeting the community’s properties and ignoring their grievances.The operation lasted from 7pm until 11pm, and electricity to the place of worship and neighbouring areas was also cut off. The action was not strictly administrative as during the entire time, locals said, a number of people had gathered chanting provocative slogans against the persecuted community. This was the latest in a series of actions targeting Ahmadis. According to data, at least 22 of their places of worship were destroyed across Punjab in 2024.","A pre-Partition place of worship of the minority Ahmadi community was completely demolished by the local administration in Punjab.

"Imran, wife sentenced to jail in corruption case",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imran-wife-sentenced-to-jail-in-corruption-case/articleshow/117340821.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Jailed Pakistani former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi , were sentenced to 14-year and seven-year jail terms, respectively, after an accountability court found the couple guilty of corruption by receiving land as a bribe from a Pakistani real-estate czar.The makeshift court operating from Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, where Khan has been incarcerated since Aug 2023, had reserved its verdict three times in the £190-million (about Rs 2,003 crore in Indian currency) Al-Qadir Trust case since Dec last year. Following the ruling, Bushra was arrested from the courtroom.Accountability court judge Nasir Javed Rana also fined Khan Pakistani Rs 1 million ($3,500), while Bibi was fined half that amount.Failure to pay the fines would result in an additional six months in jail for Imran and three months for Bushra, the judge said.According to the verdict, the property of the “sham trust Al-Qadir University Project Trust is hereby forfeited to the federal govt”.“Both convicts are present before the court; they be taken into custody in this case and be handed over to the jail superintendent along with the committal warrant to serve the sentences so awarded,” it added.The couple were indicted in the case on Feb 27, 2024, shortly after the general elections.The case alleges that Khan and his wife had acquired land worth billions of rupees (millions of US dollars) for the Al-Qadir Trust from Malik Riaz Hussain, a prominent property tycoon in Pakistan, to establish a nonprofit educational institute for the poor. In return, Pakistan’s anti-corruption watchdog alleged, Khan’s govt from Aug 2018 to April 2022 had provided legal cover to Riaz’s black money (£130 million), which Britain’s National Crime Agency had recovered and handed over to the Pakistan govt.This has been the fourth major case in which the former cricket star has been convicted. Last year, Khan was convicted in cases related to selling state gifts, leaking state secrets, and unlawful marriage, all of which were later overturned or suspended by the Islamabad high court. Despite this, Khan remains behind bars, with dozens of cases pending against him. He describes the cases as a political witch-hunt.Khan was first arrested in connection with the Al-Qadir Trust case on May 9, 2023, spending just two days in detention. However, the arrest had sparked nationwide protests during which Khan’s supporters had stormed govt buildings and military installations in multiple cities.Speaking to reporters inside the courtroom after his conviction, Imran rejected the notion of striking a deal with anyone to get himself freed from prison. “I will neither make any deal nor seek any relief,” he told reporters, adding that those who stand against dictatorship are punished.His Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI)condemned the conviction as a continuation of “bogus persecution” against Khan and his wife. “While the party awaits the detailed decision, it is important to note that the Al Qadir Trust case against Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi lacks any solid foundation and is bound to collapse,” the PTI said. “All evidence and witness testimonies confirm that there has been no mismanagement or wrongdoing. Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi are merely trustees, with no further involvement in the matter,” it added.","Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to 14-year and seven-year jail terms, respectively.
