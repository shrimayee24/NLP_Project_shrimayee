Who was Saquib Nanchan?



NEW DELHI: Saquib Nachan, an ISIS-linked convicted terrorist, died at Safdarjung Hospital in New Delhi on Saturday while receiving medical treatment, as confirmed by Tihar Jail authorities.Nachan was incarcerated in Tihar Jail Number 1 from December 27, 2023, before being transferred to a hospital due to his declining health condition.His medical journey involved an initial referral to Deen Dayal Upadhyay (DDU) Hospital on June 22, followed by a transfer to Safdarjung Hospital on June 25. The Tihar administration received notification at 4 pm that Nachan had expired at 11.30 am on Saturday, according to ANI.His remains will be released to his family following post-mortem examination, with the final rites scheduled for Sunday at Borivali village near Padgha.Saquib faced conviction for his role in the Mumbai bomb blasts of 2002 and 2003, and held the position of self-proclaimed Amir-e-Hind for ISIS in India.The NIA's 2023 arrest of Nachan was based on allegations of his active involvement in promoting ISIS terrorist activities, the designated foreign terrorist organisation.The agency alleged his participation in the creation, instruction and assessment of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) intended for terrorist operations.According to the federal agency, Nachan collaborated with other accused individuals in what became known as the Pune ISIS module case.Sources indicate that his son and legal representative visited him in hospital earlier this week.Following his conviction in 2016 for the 2002-03 Mumbai bomb blasts, Nachan completed a 10-year sentence before release, according to the official.In 2023, the National Investigation Agency apprehended Nachan and others for alleged terrorist activities, including IED production to advance the agenda of the banned ISIS organisation.NIA reports identified Nachan as the primary accused and self-proclaimed leader who administered the 'Bayath' oath of allegiance to the self-styled 'Khalifa' of ISIS for new members.Investigation agencies reported that the accused had declared the village an independent zone and centre for their alleged anti-national operations.In June 2024, the NIA filed charges against him and 16 other ISIS operatives. The charges pertained to their alleged conspiracy to recruit youth, produce explosives, propagate ISIS ideology in India, and manufacture improvised explosive devices in connection with the Delhi-Padgha ISIS terror module case.The Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) conducted extensive searches at 22 locations in Borivali and Padgha in early June, briefly detaining several suspects, including Nachan's relatives, who were released after questioning.""Two separate cases were registered in connection with these searches, which were based on specific inputs that Nachan and his associates had brainwashed and instigated people from the village to participate in anti-national activities,"" the official said.The ATS statement indicated the searches were part of measures following the April 22 Pahalgam attack in Jammu and Kashmir, aimed at identifying anti-national elements providing logistical support for terrorist activities.Police have increased security presence in Padgha and neighbouring Bhiwandi in preparation for Nachan's final rites.""We are keeping a tab on the situation,"" said a police official.","Saquib Nachan, an ISIS-linked convicted terrorist, died at Safdarjung Hospital in New Delhi on Saturday.

NEW DELHI: Amidst the growing rift with the Congress Party, Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor on Saturday appears to have sided with the RSS-BJP over the leader of the opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi's accusation that the RSS wanted 'Manusmriti', not the Constitution.While answering to a question over Rahul Gandhi's tweet that the RSS-BJP want Manusmriti instead of the Constitution, Congress MP said that historically the Raebareli MP is right as then RSS chief MS Golwalkar had said that one of the greatest flaws of the Constitution is that there is nothing of the Manusmriti in it. ""But I think the RSS itself has moved on from those days,"" Tharoor said.""Historically, he's (Rahul Gandhi) referring to the fact that that was a criticism expressed at the time of the adoption of the Constitution. Mr Golwalkar, amongst others, said that one of the greatest flaws of the Constitution is that there is nothing of the Manusmriti in it, but I think the RSS itself has moved on from those days. So, as a historical statement, it's accurate, whether it's a reflection of how they feel today. The RSS should be in the best position to answer that..."" Tharoor said while talking to reporters.Shashi Tharoor’s widening rift with the Congress Party has come under renewed spotlight after a string of pointed remarks and cryptic social media posts seemingly challenging the party's leadership.One such post read, “Don’t ask permission to fly. The wings are yours. And the sky belongs to no one.” This, followed by a series of similar messages, signaled growing tensions between Tharoor and the party.The tensions between Tharoor and Congress leadership rose after he praised PM Modi’s diplomacy during Operation Sindoor in a Hindu article, describing his “energy” and “dynamism” as assets for India’s global standing. The PMO shared the piece, fuelling speculation about Tharoor’s loyalty.Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge indirectly rebuked him, suggesting his praise for PM Modi was inappropriate. ""We say nation first, but some consider Modi first, country later. What can we do about that?"" he asked.Tharoor, however, clarified that his remarks reflected national interest, not support for the BJP.","Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor appears to have sided with the RSS-BJP over Rahul Gandhi's accusation that the RSS wanted 'Manusmriti', not the Constitution.

The party unequivocally disassociates itself from their statements and strongly condemns the same.”Backing the party’s statement, TMC MP Mahua Moitra wrote on X: “Misogyny in India cuts across party lines. What differentiates @AITCofficial is that we condemn these disgusting comments no matter who makes them.”However, the party's censure prompted a sharp response from Kalyan Banerjee, who posted a strongly worded reply on X, questioning the party's moral clarity. “Completely disagree with the post made by @AITCofficial on X. Are they indirectly supporting the leaders who are shielding these criminals? Mere academic statements won't bring any real change unless immediate action is taken against those leaders directly responsible,” he wrote.Banerjee further said, “What's even more unfortunate is that some of the leaders who emerged after 2011 are themselves under question in such crimes. I also wish to clearly distance myself from those who are encouraging or protecting these criminals. To truly understand the intent behind my words and statements, a certain level of moral and intellectual alignment is required — which, unfortunately, seems to be missing. ”Meanwhile, Banerjee also took a veiled swipe at sections within his own party, alleging that some leaders who rose to prominence after 2011 were themselves facing serious allegations. “What’s even more unfortunate is that some of the leaders who emerged after 2011 are themselves under question in such crimes,” he said.The backlash followed remarks made by Banerjee on Friday when he said, “What can be done if a friend rapes his friend? Will the police be there in schools? This was done by students to another student. Who will protect her?” While he maintained that the accused should be arrested, his comments were widely criticised for appearing to shift responsibility away from the perpetrators.Earlier in the day, TMC MLA Madan Mitra also sparked outrage for blaming the survivor. “If someone calls you when the college is closed, then don't go. If she had taken a friend or informed someone, this wouldn’t have happened,” he had said.The alleged gang-rape took place on June 25 at South Calcutta Law College. The 24-year-old complainant accused three men - Manojit Mishra, Pramit Mukherjee, and Zaib Ahmed - of taking her to a guard’s room, raping her, recording the assault, and threatening to leak the video. She said she was confined for over three hours and was hit with a hockey stick when she resisted.All three accused were arrested within 24 hours. Mishra, a former Trinamool Chhatra Parishad office-bearer, was working at the college on a temporary staff contract and is a practising lawyer. The college’s security guard, Pinaki Banerjee, has also been arrested. The accused are in police custody until July 1, and a Special Investigation Team (SIT) has been set up.The National Commission for Women (NCW) has taken suo motu cognisance of the incident and demanded a time-bound probe.

Someone or the other is associated with Trinamool everywhere... We get our photos taken with everyone, but what's inside a person, only a psychologist can tell.”MP Kalyan Banerjee on Friday also triggered a controversy by saying, “What can be done if a friend rapes his friend?”Banerjee questioned the role of police in such incidents and added, “Will the police be there in schools? This was done by students to another student.Who will protect her?” He insisted that the accused should be arrested but distanced himself from the incident, stating, “I am not an advocate into the incident that occurred at the Law College but the accused should be arrested. A few men commit this type of crime.”His remarks came even as the alleged gang-rape of the 24-year-old law student continues to trigger public outrage and political backlash in West Bengal. The incident, which took place inside the premises of South Calcutta Law College, has drawn comparisons to the earlier RG Kar case, reviving grim memories of systemic lapses.According to the student’s police complaint, she was raped by three men — Manojit Mishra, a former Trinamool Chhatra Parishad office-bearer now working on an ad hoc teaching assignment, and two junior students, Pramit Mukherjee and Zaib Ahmed. She alleged that the trio forced her into the college guard room, undressed and gang-raped her, filmed the assault, and threatened to leak the footage if she approached police.“When I resisted, one of them hit me with a hockey stick,” she said. “I touched his feet, but he did not let me go.” She also reported that she was confined for over three hours and suffered a panic attack. The assailants only allowed her to use an inhaler, denying her further help.All three accused were arrested within 24 hours. Later, the college security guard, Pinaki Banerjee, was also held. A five-member Special Investigation Team (SIT) was formed by Kolkata Police to probe the case. The accused have been remanded to police custody till July 1.The National Commission for Women (NCW) has taken suo motu cognisance of the incident and has demanded a time-bound investigation under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. BJP national president JP Nadda has also constituted a four-member inquiry team comprising Satpal Singh, Meenakshi Lekhi, Biplab Deb and Manan Mishra to visit the college and submit a detailed report.Meanwhile, BJP leaders across Bengal have mounted pressure on chief minister Mamata Banerjee. “This incident reveals the character of TMC and their thoughts towards women. I demand Mamata Banerjee’s immediate resignation,” said BJP MLA Shankar Ghosh.Union minister and West Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar was detained by police while protesting the incident. “This is the face of democracy in West Bengal... Mamata Banerjee has ruined it,” he said.BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra also hit out at the chief minister, saying, “There is an air of disbelief about where Bengal is heading. Where there is a female chief minister, there ought to be sensitivity towards women, so why is there such cruelty?”The centring of blame on the victim by a senior TMC leader has deepened political tensions and drawn strong condemnation from opposition parties and civil society groups, who have demanded accountability, justice for the survivor, and an end to institutional negligence.","TMC leader Madan Mitra appeared to blame the victim in the Kolkata law college gang-rape case.

NEW DELHI: The medical examination of the 24-year-old law student, who was gang-raped inside South Calcutta Law College allegedly by an alumnus and two senior students, has confirmed signs of brutal sexual assault including “forceful penetration, bite marks and nail scratches on her body,” a Kolkata Police officer told PTI.The incident took place on the evening of June 25 inside a guard’s room adjacent to the student union office, police said, after the woman was reportedly assaulted for rejecting a marriage proposal from the main accused.The three men, including a practising criminal lawyer and two senior students have been arrested and remanded to police custody for four days. Forensic experts have sealed the crime scene and seized mobile phones of the accused for further investigation.According to the complaint filed at Kasba police station, the student had visited the college to fill out exam forms when she was asked to stay back. She alleged that after refusing a marriage proposal from the prime accused, she was physically assaulted, dragged into a room, and raped while the other two accused stood guard. The ordeal allegedly lasted over three hours, from around 7.30 pm to 10.30 pm.The survivor further told police that she was filmed during the assault and threatened with the release of the footage.She was also warned against informing anyone, with threats made against her boyfriend and family, police sources told PTI.“We are trying to find out whether the footage was forwarded to other numbers,” the officer added.Chief Public Prosecutor Sourin Ghosal told PTI that, “According to a Supreme Court judgement, all persons in a group involved in cases of gang rape must be held liable, even if all of them did not commit the act of rape. In this case, two other persons helped in the rape. So this is a case of gang rape, and they are also accused in the case.”The prime accused, a former student of the law college, had been hired as temporary non-teaching staff for 45 days. His social media profiles claimed he was a former president of the college's Trinamool Congress Chhatra Parishad (TMCP) unit and a current office-bearer of the south Kolkata wing of the TMC’s student body. Photos circulating online also show him alongside senior leaders of the ruling party.The Trinamool Congress has denied any current link with the accused and demanded ""severe punishment"" if he is found guilty.The case has triggered political uproar and street protests. Supporters of the SFI-DYFI clashed with police outside Kasba police station on Friday. Protesters from the BJP, Congress and AIDSO were also detained following separate demonstrations.Leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari has warned of escalating protests, while both the BJP and Congress have announced agitation programmes for Saturday.TMCP president Trinankur Bhattacharya distanced the organisation from the accused, saying the student union at the college has been defunct for years.State Minister Shashi Panja, addressing a press conference, said, “The state government stands firmly with the victim and her family. Instead of making the victim a battleground for politics, her pain must be understood, she must be respected, and justice must be ensured – swiftly and unconditionally.”The National Commission for Women has taken suo motu cognisance of the case and directed Kolkata Police to submit a detailed report within three days.The case has drawn comparisons with the August 2023 rape and murder of a medical intern at RG Kar Medical College, which also sparked widespread outrage and calls for better campus safety measures across West Bengal.(With inputs fro agencies)","The 24-year-old law student was allegedly gang-raped inside South Calcutta Law College.

Driving the news

Trump Gives Troops Free Hand At Border? More Trouble For Immigrants As U.S. Expands Military Zones

Why it matters

These twin operations signal a tectonic shift in the Middle East power balance. With its military elite decapitated, Iran faces an uncertain future.

Israel, meanwhile, has solidified its regional military dominance and is now eyeing a historic realignment of alliances.

US support - delivered through precision bunker-buster strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites - amplified the effect. President Donald Trump declared Iran’s nuclear program “obliterated.” But analysts question whether Iran's capacity has truly been neutralized or merely delayed.

The attacks also exposed how deeply Israeli intelligence has penetrated Iran, including the ability to stage drone strikes from within the country - a psychological as well as tactical coup.

The big picture

The Wall Street Journal’s report, based on interviews with 18 Israeli and US officials, reads like a thriller - but the consequences are deadly real:

'Red Wedding' was designed to wipe out Iran’s senior military planners in a single strike. Israeli intelligence tracked their movements and struck when they unknowingly clustered together. “Rather than scattering, they gathered - sealing their fate,” WSJ wrote.

'Operation Narnia', dubbed so for its implausibility, eliminated key scientific minds behind Iran’s nuclear program. The assassinations were nearly simultaneous, designed to prevent escape or dispersion.

The plan had its roots in a two-decade-long intelligence and training effort. Starting in the 1990s, Israel identified the need not only to destroy Iranian nuclear infrastructure but also the human capital behind it.

Israeli F-15s and F-16s trained for long-range missions in Greek airspace and later honed those capabilities during strikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen - a proving ground for the logistics now deployed against Iran.

Netanyahu’s final go-ahead came on June 9. To preserve surprise, Israel deployed strategic deception - including faking a wedding for Netanyahu’s son and leaking false tensions with Trump to lull Tehran into complacency.

Zoom in: How they did it

Spycraft and drones: Mossad smuggled in parts for explosive quadcopter drones hidden in shipping containers and trucks. Teams set them up near air-defense systems and missile sites, ready to strike at launch time.

Airspace advantage: The fall of Syria’s Iranian-aligned government in early 2025 cleared the path for Israeli jets to fly through without resistance - a key enabler of the operation’s success.

Information dominance: Israeli intelligence mapped Iran’s air defense grid using thousands of data points. At the critical moment, Iranian defenses were neutralized - by both remote attacks and internal sabotage.

US partnership: Trump’s support came later - but crucially. US forces struck deep underground nuclear facilities, including Fordo, with B-2 bombers and Tomahawk missiles.

Trump claimed, “Nothing was taken out... too dangerous, and very heavy and hard to move!” in response to reports Iran may have evacuated uranium ahead of the strike.

Between the lines

A ceasefire, but not peace

Twelve days of war between Iran and Israel have ended in uneasy silence. The bombs have stopped falling, but Iran’s theocratic regime is in chaos.

Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 86 and visibly weakened, finally emerged on state TV to insist that the US and Israeli strikes had “achieved nothing significant.” Most observers - and satellite imagery - disagreed.

Iran’s nuclear infrastructure is badly damaged. Its Revolutionary Guard’s leadership has been decimated. Its elite scientists are dead. And perhaps most damning: Israel operated with almost complete impunity, exposing Iran’s hollow air defenses and compromised intelligence apparatus.

The ceasefire, brokered with US pressure, gave Tehran a break - but not a win. “There must be some sort of purge,” said Hamidreza Azizi of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. “But who will implement it? That is the question.”

What’s next





Operation Narnia. Red Wedding. A vanished Supreme Leader. Nine scientists dead before sunrise. What unfolded over Tehran this month wasn’t just a military campaign. It was a high-wire act of deception, logistics, and old-fashioned assassination - carried out with such precision it felt pulled from fantasy. But according to the Wall Street Journal, every bit of it was real. And if the consequences weren’t already grave, they are only just beginning to unfold.Israel’s June 13 airstrike - 'Red Wedding' - marked the deadliest and most consequential single night in its long-simmering shadow war with Iran. The Wall Street Journal reveals how Israeli jets eliminated Iran’s top air force leadership in one fell swoop, comparing the stunning outcome to the infamous massacre from Game of Thrones.This was no isolated blow. That night also marked the success of 'Operation Narnia', a parallel mission that simultaneously killed nine of Iran’s leading nuclear scientists. Within hours, Iran’s military and nuclear elite were shattered.Deception was critical. Netanyahu’s team played a long game, misleading both Iran and global observers. Media leaks falsely implied Trump was holding Israel back from attacking.Netanyahu publicly planned a family wedding. Israeli military movements were framed as drills.The real victory? Intelligence. Israeli infiltration of Iran was so complete that it not only enabled high-precision targeting but allowed drone teams to operate inside Iran - and coordinate with airstrikes.Strategic misdirection worked. Iranian commanders, misreading Israeli and American intentions, assembled in a single location. Israel’s elite strike forces were waiting.The risk was massive. Had even one part failed - if scientists escaped or defenses held - retaliation could’ve been catastrophic. Israel bet big. It won. For now.Iran may accelerate its nuclear weaponization - the very thing Israel sought to stop. US intelligence is divided over whether the program was set back by years or just months.Meanwhile, President Trump says backchannel talks with Iran are “already happening.” His envoy Steve Witkoff hinted at a “long-term peace agreement.”Meanwhile, Tehran is denying plans to resume nuclear talks.For now, Iran's regime seems far away from collapse - it's just wounded. And wounded regimes don’t always back down. They often lash out.In 'Game of Thrones', the 'Red Wedding' wasn’t just a massacre. It shattered the rules. It ended one war and started another. Israel’s own 'Red Wedding' may have done the same.(With inputs from agencies)",'Red Wedding' was designed to wipe out Iran’s senior military planners in a single strike.

All OK here, say inmates' kin day after home horror





NOIDA: The realities of Anand Niketan didn't matter. Despite findings during a govt inspection about inmates being mistreated and kept in unsanitary conditions at the privately run old age home, it seems their families don't want them back.On Saturday, the kin of most of Anand Niketan Vridh Seva Ashram's 40 inmates who turned up after the trust running the home sought signed forms from them, readily gave consent. There was no anger about conditions at the home or angst about how health situations are addressed. Several of Anand Niketan's residents are in their 70s and 80s. ""Food comes on time and they seem OK,"" was a common refrain.Among those who signed was the family of a resident who has four daughters. The daughters claimed there was no place for their mother to live as all of them were married and had their own families and households to look after. ""We are four sisters, and our mom stays at this old age home. She gets food on time. The home takes proper care,"" one of the daughters who was at Anand Niketan on Saturday said.Also among visitors was a 25-year-old woman whose grandmother resides at the old-age home.She said, ""I come to see her every month and she seems very comfortable here. The staff takes proper care. We could not keep her at home due to her health condition. Here, she is taken care of,"" she said, without elaborating on what the condition is.One of the main findings of the inspection was that there was no trained medic on call at Anand Niketan. And most of the caretakers who manage the place are school passouts, with no qualification in elder care.Praveen Mathur, relative of another Anand Niketan resident, said, ""We want the old age home to continue. Things are alright here. My uncle has been here for more than five years and there has been no problem so far.""By evening, 21 families had given their written consent, with which the trust wants to insulate itself from legal action and prevent residents from being shifted to other shelters. UP women's commission member Meenakshi Bharala, who led the inspection on Thursday night, had said all inmates would be moved out. She also recommended sealing of Anand Niketan.Three of the inmates who needed medical attention were shifted to a govt shelter in Dankaur on Friday, among them a 69-year-old woman from Kerala. It was a video showing her sitting helplessly on a floor with her hands tied that had triggered the inspection.Amarveer Singh, a trustee of Anand Niketan, told TOI on Saturday, ""When she came, she was termed 'abnormal' in the admission form. The woman's hands were tied because she would throw utensils at caretakers. It was a measure taken to ensure her safety and that of the staff.""TOI learnt her family, which is based in Noida, had taken her from the Dankaur shelter on Saturday. Another inmate who was moved out after the inspection - an 80-year-old who had spoken to TOI on Friday, identifying himself as a doctor and claiming the staff keeps him locked inside a room - was brought back to Anand Niketan on Saturday morning by his niece.","Anand Niketan Vridh Seva Ashram's 40 inmates turned up at the home on Saturday. kin of most of the inmates readily gave consent.

A toxic mix of clout and impunity





Pramit, Manojit, Zaib

Estranged at home, feared on campus



(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)





NEW DELHI: Even before the horrific ‘gang-rape’ allegations against Manojit Mishra stunned Kolkata, many students at the law college knew him not for his legal acumen but for the unchecked power he allegedly wielded on campus — and the fear he instilled among women.A college insider has now revealed that Manojit, also known as ‘Mango’, had a long history of recording private moments of women, morphing their pictures and sharing them in WhatsApp groups for amusement and ridicule.“He filmed private moments with women and showed them to his friends. He recorded almost everything. He and his aides used to click photos of women and post them in groups, body shaming and maligning them,” she said.Another source said that multiple complaints of molestation, harassment, assault and even extortion had been filed against him with the college authorities and police. ""The party had been alerted too, but no action followed,"" the source said.Manojit’s fall from grace was neither sudden nor unpredictable. He first enrolled in 2007 and later rejoined the college in 2017, but reportedly dropped out midway during both stints.Despite being ousted from the college's Trinamool Chhatra Parishad unit in 2021 over rowdyism, he returned the following year — not as a student, but as a contractual staff member, armed with a governing body appointment letter.In 2022, he formally graduated and began practicing at Alipore court. But insiders say his real influence stemmed not from the law, but from politics.""He was the 121st candidate in a class with 120 seats. Everyone knew it. But no one questioned it, thanks to his political backing,” said a batchmate.Even after the dissolution of the college’s official Trinamool unit in 2017 — following an incident where Manojit allegedly led a group to vandalise the principal’s office — his grip on campus only grew stronger. Sources say he operated without formal party designation, but acted as the de facto TMCP strongman on campus.He ran college WhatsApp groups where he allegedly removed students at will, used access to staff rooms, and organised events with full authority. Students claim that his leadership style was not only intimidating but deeply misogynistic.Back home in Kalighat, Manojit lived alone. His father, Robin Mishra — a local priest — had severed ties with him five years ago. The two live just four houses apart but haven’t spoken in years. ""Let the law take its course. If he’s done it, let him be punished. The survivor is also someone’s daughter,"" Robin said.Neighbours described Manojit as volatile and disruptive. “There were always fights, drunken brawls, people screaming outside his house,” one said. “One of the co-accused seen on TV was here recently after another drinking session.”His mother and sister had reportedly moved out years ago. His grandmother, who lived with him, passed away in 2023.","Manojit Mishra, also known as 'Mango', allegedly recorded private moments of women, morphing their pictures and sharing them in WhatsApp groups for amusement and ridicule.

Senate Republicans in the United States took a key step on Saturday (local time) towards passing President Donald Trump's proposed economic package, which includes tax cuts, spending reductions, and increased funding for deportation efforts. However, the final fate of the bill remains uncertain as more hurdles lie ahead.In a closely watched vote late Saturday night, the Senate passed a procedural motion 51-49, allowing the chamber to begin debating the bill.

A 6-year old British boy was apprehended along with multiple adults in Mauritius in connection with a significant £1.6million (Rs 18.78 crore approx) drug trafficking operation, according to by several UK media outlets.The incident reported occurred last Sunday at Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam International Airport (MRU), Mauritius's primary international gateway, where authorities allegedly found 161kg of cannabis concealed in their luggage. Report from the Mirror indicate the child's luggage contained 24 packages totalling 14kg. His 35-year-old mother allegedly carried 29 packages, while her Romanian companion was found with 32 packages.Local authorities estimated the seized substances would value approximately £1.6million in the regional drug market. The operation resulted in the detention of five British women, one British man, one Romanian man, and the child. The adults subsequently appeared before a Mahebourg court, facing provisional drug-related charges.Additionally, according to Mauritian newspaper Defi Media, the adults remain in custody after police opposed their conditional release.The British High Commission was notified regarding the child's situation following his and his mother's arrest. Subsequent UK media reports claimed that the child returned home on Wednesday, with his father receiving him at the airport.A Foreign Office spokesperson told The Mirror: ""We are supporting several British nationals who are detained in Mauritius and are in contact with the local authorities.""Reports suggest customs and police officials maintained surveillance on the group from their arrival on British Airways flight BA 2065 from London Gatwick Airport on Sunday.","A 6-year old British boy was apprehended along with multiple adults in Mauritius.

Hundreds of protesters marched through central Venice on Saturday as billionaire Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez concluded their three-day wedding celebrations in the lagoon city.On Friday, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and media personality Sánchez tied the knot in an opulent wedding ceremony on the island of San Giorgio, joined by about 200 celebrity guests.In pics: Eat the cake or eat the rich? Hundreds march in Venice against Bezos-Sanchez wedding; fiery slogans echo through historic city On Saturday, hundreds of locals and activists marched through the city, waving banners that read “Kisses Yes, Bezos No” and “No Bezos, No War.” Many Venetians expressed frustration over what they saw as the billionaire's lavish intrusion into a city already grappling with the pressures of overtourism, rising housing costs, and climate change.Protesters criticized the extravagance of the event and its symbolic disconnect from the daily challenges faced by residents.The couple stayed at the Aman Venice hotel on the Grand Canal and hosted a series of exclusive events throughout the weekend.The guest list featured several prominent names, including Oprah Winfrey, Tom Brady, Leonardo DiCaprio, Orlando Bloom, Bill Gates, and members of the Kardashian-Jenner family.Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner also attended the festivities with their children.Activists claimed their demonstration led to a last-minute venue change for Saturday’s party, reported AP.Bezos has donated €1 million each to three environmental organisations working to preserve Venice, including Corila, a Venetian research association. However, the gesture was met with skepticism by many demonstrators, who viewed the donation as insufficient.“Those donations are just a misery and only aimed at clearing Bezos’ conscience,” said Flavio Cogo, a local activist.Despite the backlash, the city’s administration defended the high-profile wedding, stating that Venice has always welcomed visitors—from emperors to celebrities—and that such events align with its tradition as an open and global city.","Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and media personality Lauren Sánchez tied the knot in an opulent wedding ceremony on the island of San Giorgio on Friday.

'If you want war, send your own kid',

A political hot potato in combat boots





As US bombed three Iranian soil last week amidst Israel-Iran conflict, a different kind of battle waged online aimed at one unexpected figure: Barron Trump.The 19-year-old son of President Donald J Trump, who just wrapped up his freshman year at NYU, has found himself at the center of a growing social media firestorm where netizens react to Trump's Iran bombings with the growing demand of enlisting Barron Trump in the US army.On X, many have echoed a common refrain: if President Trump is prepared to send other people’s children into harm’s way, shouldn’t his own son be first in line?""Trump has us at war. Barron should sign up for the Army now"", reacted one user.Another commented, ""POTUS @Trump should order his son Barron to immediately enlist into US Army and be sent to fight Iran. Bravo”""And with the first pick of the 2025 US Draft, the US Army Selects…Barron Trump out of Mar-a-Lago""There is no legal requirement for the children of US presidents to serve in the military.Barron Trump, by all public accounts, has maintained a low profile since his father returned to office. But the renewed scrutiny stems not solely from Barron Trump’s personal choices, but from a broader debate over political accountability and military service. President Donald Trump, now serving his second term, avoided the Vietnam War draft five times, once citing bone spurs. No member of the Trump family has served in the armed forces.As the administration faces questions about the legality and consequences of the strikes on Iran, online discourse has increasingly invoked what critics label “Chickenhawk Syndrome” — a term referring to political leaders who support military action without having direct personal or familial involvement in combat.Also read | Let Bibi go': Trump slams Netanyahu trial as ‘witch hunt’; warns of stalled Hamas, Iran talks","Netizens react to Trump's Iran bombings; calls for Barron Trump to enlist in US army after Iran strikes.

Why is Netanyahu facing courtroom trial ?





US President Donald Trump has lashed out at Israeli prosecutors for what he describes as a “POLITICAL WITCH HUNT” against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Trump in his recent post on Truth Social defended Netanyahu, describing him as a ""War Hero"" and praising his leadership, especially in working closely with the US to counter Iran’s nuclear ambitions. He credited Netanyahu with playing a key role in what he called a ""Great Success"" in curbing Iran's nuclear threat.“It is terrible what they are doing in Israel to Bibi Netanyahu. He is a War Hero, and a Prime Minister who did a fabulous job working with the United States to bring Great Success in getting rid of the dangerous Nuclear threat in Iran.”, Trump wrote.Highlighting the Israeli leader’s current diplomatic efforts, Trump emphasized that Netanyahu is in the middle of crucial negotiations with Hamas aimed at securing the release of hostages. He questioned how someone in such a high-stakes position could be expected to ""sit in a Courtroom all day long"" over what he described as trivial matters—mockingly referencing items like “Cigars” and even a “Bugs Bunny Doll” to downplay the severity of the charges.He ended his statement with a rallying cry of support for Netanyahu:“We just had a Great Victory with Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu at the helm — And this greatly tarnishes our Victory. LET BIBI GO, HE’S GOT A BIG JOB TO DO!”This isn’t the first time Trump has criticized Netanyahu’s trial.Just last week, he made a similar statement following the implementation of the ceasefire between Israel and Iran.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is currently facing several corruption charges, first filed in 2019, including bribery, fraud, and breach of trust.In the first case, Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, are accused of accepting over $260,000 in luxury items—such as cigars, champagne, and jewelry—from wealthy businessmen in return for political favors. The two remaining cases claim he sought to secure more favorable media coverage from prominent Israeli news outlets.If convicted, he could face up to 10 years in prison. Since the trial began in May 2020, it has seen numerous delays, many of which were requested by Netanyahu himself—initially citing the conflict in Gaza, followed by the escalation in Lebanon.Also read | 'Let Bibi go': Trump slams Netanyahu trial as ‘witch hunt’; warns of stalled Hamas, Iran talks","US President Donald Trump has lashed out at Israeli prosecutors for what he describes as a “POLITICAL WITCH HUNT” against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

‘Only one to focus on New York’: Republicans laud NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani; contrasts earlier criticism,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/only-one-to-focus-on-new-york-republicans-laud-nyc-mayoral-candidate-zohran-mamdani-contrasts-earlier-criticism/articleshow/122135469.cms,"Marjorie Taylor Greene (left), Zohran Mamdani (ANI,AP)





In a surprising departure from usual partisan rhetoric, prominent Republican figures, including Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene and political commentator Tucker Carlson, have extended rare praise to New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, acknowledging his grassroots-focused campaign strategy, even as they continue to oppose his political ideology.Mamdani, a Muslim and Indian-American assemblyman,pulled a surprise victory in the Democratic primary this week, defeating former New York governor Andrew Cuomo.Carlson, on his show, lauded Mamdani’s debate performance for staying focused on New York’s local issues while other candidates discussed foreign policy.“That guy was the only person in the New York City mayor’s debate to say he wanted to focus on New York City. They were, all the candidates were asked if you could visit a foreign country, what would it be? And they all, of course, all had an answer. I think most said Israel,” Carlson said during the Friday episode of “The Tucker Carlson Show.”Carlson remarked Mamdani was the only one to say he wouldn’t travel abroad, he’d stay in New York and connect with constituents directly.The former Fox News host added about Mamdani’s performance in the mayoral debate earlier this month, “and he said, ‘I wouldn’t go anywhere.I’d stay in New York. And like, if I want to meet Jewish constituents, I go to their synagogues, their homes or whatever, but I’d be here in New York because that’s what I’m doing. I’m running New York. That’s my job,” adding, “I totally oppose his program, but at least he’s talking about economics and not just foreign affairs. ”Greene, who had earlier shared a doctored image of the Statue of Liberty in a burqa in response to Mamdani’s rise, has since revised her stance. Speaking on Steve Bannon’s podcast, she said, “He really ran a campaign where he talked directly to the people… Even though his solutions are insane and socialist, he focused on their problems.”She also took a swipe at Cuomo, labelling him a “dirty establishment Democrat” and praised Mamdani for offering “unique and smart” outreach.Both Greene and Carlson have recently criticised the administration’s handling of the Israel-Iran conflict, exposing growing rifts within the MAGA movement, between those who favour strong support for Israel and others who fear the US could be drawn into a broader war.Despite the acknowledgment, hostility remains strong in Republican circles. The New York Young Republican Club called for Mamdani’s deportation under the Communist Control Act, while representative. Andy Ogles branded him “antisemitic” and called for denaturalization proceedings.President Trump, writing on Truth Social, referred to Mamdani as a “100% Communist Lunatic,” adding, “He looks terrible… and he’s backed by AOC+3 and Cryin’ Chuck Schumer.”Mamdani has responded positively to criticism from Republican lawmakers and even the president, who labeled him a “100% Communist Lunatic” due to his policy agenda.“You know, this is not the first time that President Trump is going to comment on myself, and I encourage him, just like I encourage every New Yorker, to learn about my actual policies to make the city affordable,” Mamdani told ABC News’s Rachel Scott in an interview Wednesday.Mamdani’s campaign, which includes proposals such as free buses and rent freezes, continues to draw criticism from conservatives. Still, the recognition of his campaign tactics from unlikely quarters underscores a rare moment of bipartisan acknowledgment in an otherwise divided political landscape.","Mamdani, a Muslim and Indian-American assemblyman, pulled a surprise victory in the Democratic primary this week, defeating former New York governor Andrew Cuomo.

As Sean “Diddy” Combs' criminal trial approaches its conclusion, his son Christian “King” Combs has dropped a new EP titled Never Stop, featuring seven tracks including a song pointedly named “Diddy Free. ” The release coincided with the day Diddy's legal team was scheduled to deliver its closing arguments, marking a bold musical statement from the younger Combs in collaboration with Kanye West.“Diddy Free” opens with the line, “n***as ain’t going to sleep till we see Diddy free.”The track, credited to King Combs and Ye (formerly Kanye West), features pointed lyrics criticizing those who ""try to play the victim"" and boldly declares, ""f*** the world, critics and the witness.""In one verse, 27-year-old King Combs raps, “this Bible might come in handy / this rifle might come in handy,” while the chorus pledges to stay awake and vigilant “’til we see Diddy free.”North West, daughter of Ye, is also credited as a featured artist on the EP’s opening track, “Lonely Roads.”During the closing arguments on Friday morning, lead attorney Marc Agnifilo denounced the case as a “fake trial.”A demo version of the track by Ye, without King Combs, had surfaced online last month.Ye, who has faced widespread backlash and isolation in the music industry due to his ongoing antisemitic remarks, has been one of the few high-profile celebrities to publicly support Sean “Diddy” Combs, who is facing charges of sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy.Earlier this month, Ye made a brief appearance at the Manhattan courthouse where the trial is taking place, showing solidarity with Combs amid his continued run of controversial and inflammatory statements throughout 2025.Ye is listed as the executive producer of King Combs’s new EP, Never Stop, which features cover art that seemingly shows the rundown headquarters of Bad Boy Worldwide, Sean Combs’s entertainment label. According to Ye, her involvement in an earlier version of the track had previously caused tension with ex-wife Kim Kardashian.Sean Combs, who has pleaded not guilty to all charges, could face a life sentence if convicted. Following more than a month of witness testimony and evidence, he chose not to take the stand in his defense earlier this week. On Thursday, federal prosecutors delivered an over four hours long closing argument, urging the jury to find Combs guilty and describing him as “the leader of a criminal enterprise.”All of this evidence paints a clear picture of how the defendant committed crimes,” assistant US attorney Christy Slavik said Thursday.“Up until today, he was able to get away with it because of his money, his power (and) his influence. That stops now. It’s time for justice. It’s time to find the defendant guilty,” he added.","Christian ""King"" Combs has released a new EP titled Never Stop.

In a first of its kind lawsuit involving children, a Honduran mother and her two young children have sued the US government over their arrest outside a Texas courthouse, alleging violations of constitutional rights. The family, who legally entered the US using the CBP One app, is detained at the Dilley immigration processing center and is fighting for release, according to the news agency AP.Filed in Texas, the lawsuit argues that their arrest violated the Fourth Amendment’s protection against unlawful searches and seizures and the Fifth Amendment’s guarantee of due process. According to their legal team, led by Columbia Law School professor Elora Mukherjee, the family complied fully with immigration procedures before being taken into custody.The mother and her children fled Honduras in October 2024 following death threats. After being paroled into the US by the department of homeland security, they were scheduled to appear before an immigration court in Los Angeles on May 29. But immediately after the judge dismissed their case, ICE agents allegedly arrested them outside the courtroom, placing them in expedited removal, a fast-track deportation process.Their lawyers argue the arrest was traumatic, especially for the 6-year-old boy, a leukemia patient who missed a vital check-up due to the detention.""He’s pale, bruising, and suffering bone pain,” Mukherjee said, adding that the boy urinated on himself in fear after an officer exposed a firearm.Though their appeal is pending, the family could be deported any day. Advocates say the case highlights growing concerns about the Trump administration’s continuation of aggressive immigration enforcement, particularly at courthouses.""This family followed every rule,"" said attorney Kate Gibson Kumar of the Texas civil rights project. “With young children involved, there must be protections.”The department of homeland security has not commented. The government has until July 1 to respond to the lawsuit.","A Honduran mother and her two young children have sued the US government over their arrest outside a Texas courthouse.

What Is Birthright Citizenship?

Trump’s executive order and the legal backlash



The Supreme Court’s ruling: what it changes

What comes next for immigrants?





The US Supreme Court has curtailed the power of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions, clearing the way for President Donald Trump’s controversial order to end birthright citizenship to take effect in over half the country. The ruling does not address whether the order is constitutional but allows it to be enforced in 28 states that had not challenged it, while keeping it temporarily blocked in 22 Democratic-led states. Immigrant rights groups have warned the decision could result in stateless newborns and a chaotic patchwork of laws across the US.The 6–3 decision came in response to President Donald Trump’s controversial executive order ending birthright citizenship for children born to undocumented or temporary visa holders on US soil.The ruling was immediately hailed by Trump as a “monumental victory for the Constitution,” while immigrant rights groups and Democratic leaders voiced concern that it could lead to a patchwork of legal standards across the country and leave some newborns stateless. “By denying lower courts the ability to enforce that right uniformly, the Court has invited chaos, inequality, and fear,” said Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of Global Refuge.Although the policy remains blocked in 22 Democratic-led states that sued to stop the order, the Supreme Court imposed a 30-day delay before it can take effect in the rest of the country. That window gives immigrant rights groups time to regroup and possibly file new challenges as class-action lawsuits. But with the door now open for selective enforcement, immigration advocates warn that confusion and legal uncertainty could have devastating consequences for vulnerable families.Birthright citizenship is a constitutional right enshrined in the 14th Amendment, ratified after the Civil War to ensure citizenship for formerly enslaved people. It states, “All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.”The principle was reinforced in the landmark 1898 Supreme Court case *United States v. Wong Kim Ark*, where the court ruled that a man born in the US to Chinese parents was a citizen, regardless of his parents’ immigration status. Since then, birthright citizenship has been a cornerstone of US constitutional law.Exceptions have been extremely limited, such as children born to foreign diplomats. Trump's order seeks to broaden those exceptions dramatically.Signed in January, Trump's executive order attempts to end automatic citizenship for babies born to undocumented immigrants or temporary visa holders. He has described the policy as a “magnet for illegal immigration,” arguing that the phrase “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” in the 14th Amendment justifies excluding these children from citizenship.Lower federal courts, however, repeatedly blocked the order from taking effect. “This is a blatantly unconstitutional order,” said US District Judge John Coughenour in Seattle. In Maryland, Judge Deborah Boardman wrote that “the Supreme Court has resoundingly rejected and no court in the country has ever endorsed” Trump’s view of the 14th Amendment.Despite these rulings, the Supreme Court declined to weigh in on the constitutionality of the order itself, focusing instead on the scope of the injunctions issued by the lower courts.The court’s conservative majority, led by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, ruled that federal district judges do not have the authority to block a presidential policy nationwide. “Federal courts do not exercise general oversight of the Executive Branch,” Barrett wrote.The decision sends the current challenges back to the lower courts, instructing them to narrow their injunctions to only cover plaintiffs with standing in the 22 states that sued. In the remaining 28 states — including Arkansas, Mississippi, and Texas — Trump’s order could go into effect after the 30-day delay.Justice Sonia Sotomayor, writing for the dissent, called the decision “nothing less than an open invitation for the government to bypass the constitution.”Immigrant rights groups are already adjusting their legal strategies, preparing class-action lawsuits in states like Maryland and New Hampshire. However, legal experts warn that such efforts face numerous procedural hurdles. “It’s not the case that a class action is a sort of easy, breezy way of getting around this problem,” said Suzette Malveaux, a law professor at Washington and Lee University.The immediate concern is for babies born during the transition period. In the 28 states where the order may soon apply, children born to undocumented or temporary residents may be denied citizenship, risking statelessness and potential deportation.Sotomayor urged the lower courts to “act swiftly” in adjudicating new challenges to the executive order, while Trump indicated he would move quickly on a broader slate of policies that had previously been blocked by nationwide injunctions.“This morning, the Supreme Court has delivered a monumental victory for the Constitution, the separation of powers and the rule of law,” Trump declared at the White House, flanked by Attorney General Pam Bondi. “We can now promptly proceed with numerous policies, including birthright citizenship.”",The US Supreme Court has curtailed the power of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions. The ruling does not address whether the order is constitutional but allows it to be enforced in 28 states that had not challenged it. Immigrant rights groups have warned the decision could result in stateless newborns and a chaotic patchwork of laws across the US.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122125222,imgsize-1151211,width-400,resizemode-4/122125222.jpg"
Suicide car bomb attack kills 14 soldiers in Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/suicide-car-bomb-attack-kills-14-soldiers-in-pakistan/articleshow/122137689.cms,"NEW DELHI: A suicide car bomb attack targeted a Pakistan army military convoy in North Waziristan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, resulting in significant casualties. At least 14 soldiers were killed and over 24 others injured in the attack, according to officials.A 'fidayeen' rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into a mine-resistant vehicle belonging to the bomb disposal unit, a source said. The explosion caused widespread damage and the casualties. Security sources said over 500 kg of explosives was used in the attack to breach an ambush protected vehicle.The Hafiz Gul Bahadur (HGB) group, linked to the Afghan Taliban, has claimed responsibility for the attack, attributing it to their ongoing operation 'Khandak'. HGB is a Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) faction operating primarily in North Waziristan and adjacent districts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's former Federally Administered Tribal Areas region. Led by tribal leader Hafiz Gul Bahadur, the group also maintains ties with the Haqqani Network.In July last year, militants from this group had launched a pre-dawn attack on the Bannu Cantonment in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The fighters breached defences and detonated a vehicle-borne explosive, damaging cantonment infrastructure. Eight soldiers were killed and over 141 injured, including seven civilians.Saturday's VB-IED (vehicle borne-improvised explosive device) attack is the second strike on Pakistan military personnel in a week. A dozen soldiers, including Major Moiz Abbas, who had claimed capture of IAF pilot Abhinandan Varthaman during operation Balakote, was killed in the attack in South Waziristan a few days ago.","A suicide car bomb attack targeted a Pakistan army military convoy in North Waziristan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Terrorists Bleed Pakistan Army; Over A Dozen Soldiers Killed In Suicide Attack | Shehbaz Sharif





Heart-wrenching footage has emerged showing several people stranded on a narrow elevated strip in the middle of Pakistan's Swat River, moments before a deadly flash flood swept them away on Friday morning.The video, which went viral across social media platforms, captures their desperate cries for help as torrents of water surge around them.At least nine people from a single extended family lost their lives in the tragedy, according to Geo TV.The victims, including children, had gathered near the riverbank for breakfast while on a leisure trip from Sialkot. According to officials, the group was unaware of the sudden rise in water levels caused by heavy rains upstream.“They were taking selfies, and there wasn’t much water at the time,” said a family member, as quoted by news agency Reuters. “Suddenly, a massive wave came and swept them all away”, the member added.As per Swat deputy commissioner Shehzad Mehboob, 17 individuals were caught in the floodwaters. “We have recovered nine bodies so far and rescued four people alive. The search for the remaining four is ongoing,” he was quoted as saying by Geo News.Among the dead were women and children. Residents said it took over two hours for rescue teams to arrive at the scene.The devastating moment prompted an outpouring of grief in Sialkot, where the bodies of seven victims were received by wailing family members. “My children were calling for help in front of my eyes. We couldn’t save them,” said a distraught relative.The Pakistan Army has since joined local rescue teams, while the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has ordered a high-level inquiry to investigate the lapses. The committee has been given seven days to submit its report and recommend preventive measures.According to Reuters, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority has warned of continued heavy rains and potential flash floods across northern Pakistan until next week.Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed sorrow over the tragedy, calling it a “painful reminder” of nature’s fury and urging tourists to follow safety advisories, as cited by Reuters.Heavy rains have affected parts of Pakistan since earlier this week, blocking highways and damaging homes.However, weather forecasters predict that the country will experience less rainfall compared to 2022, when climate-induced downpours caused rivers to swell and flooded one-third of Pakistan, resulting in 1,739 fatalities.","At least nine people from a single extended family lost their lives in the tragedy.

Pakistan continues to 'sleepwalk' on climate change- former minister





Flash floods in Pakistan's northwest mountainious province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have killed 11 people, including four children, the country's disaster management officials said.""In the past 24 hours, flash floods and landslides have claimed the lives of 11 people, including four children and three women, while six others have been injured,"" the provincial disaster management authority said in a report released late Friday.One person was killed in the Malakand district while the 10 others were killed in the Swat Valley, according to the report. Local media reported that families had been swept away and that the flooding had damaged 56 houses along the Swat river.Pakistan's local daily newspaper Dawn reported that rescue operations were underway in several other districts with people trapped in the water.Meanwhile, the national meteorological department warned of heavy rainfall and a possibility of more flash floods until Tuesday.Pakistan is among the world's more vulnerable countries to the effect of climate change with an increasing frequency of flash floods and other climate-related events impacting its 240 million inhabitants.In May, some 24 people were killed in severe storms in Pakistan. In August 2022, a third of the country was flooded due to unprecedented monsoon rainfall with more than 33 million people affected. Scientists from across the globe have since said that the climate crisis was to blame and that rising global temperatures will only make monsoons more intense in future.Pakistan's former climate change minister Sherry Rehman took to X, saying that the nation continued to ""sleepwalk"" on climate change and the threat it posed. She pointed to regular alerts issued by the national disaster management agency and said that local authorities had failed to take them seriously.""Not only did the provincial administration fail to understand the magnitude of the crisis, I keep repeating, so did denialist tourists. This is endemic to a system that thinks that climate change can just be put on a back burner, or that crises will not multiply in scale and intensity,"" she wrote.""These are not ""natural disasters"" which absolve all actors of responsibility, local, national and global. Super monsoons and flash floods are not the norm. They have been intensifying for decades,"" she added, urging the country to ""wake up"" the to the issue.","Flash floods in Pakistan's northwest have killed 11 people, including four children.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a firm warning to Pakistan on Friday, saying that Iran must never be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons. The statement came during a call with Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif amid high tensions in the Middle East.“Secretary Rubio emphasised Iran can never develop or acquire a nuclear weapon,” said US State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce.According to Bruce, both leaders “acknowledged the importance of working together to promote a durable peace between Israel and Iran and maintaining regional stability.”The message to Islamabad comes at a sensitive time, as the country has historically tried to balance its ties with both Iran and the West. Rubio’s call comes just days after a major US military strike on Iran’s underground nuclear facilities.The strikes triggered political controversy in Islamabad which had just days earlier recommended US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize.The nomination, signed by deputy Prime Minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, praised Trump’s role in easing tensions with India. However, criticism erupted after Islamabad condemned the strikes as a breach of international law.JUI-F leader Maulana Fazlur Rehman demanded the nomination be withdrawn, calling Trump’s peace claims “false” and accusing him of backing Israeli aggression. Opposition figures, including Mushahid Hussain, slammed Trump for starting an “illegal war” and urged the government to revoke the nomination.PTI’s Raoof Hasan said the move brought “shame and embarrassment”, while other leaders, including Maleeha Lodhi and Afrasiab Khattak, labelled it undiplomatic and misguided.Pakistan’s foreign ministry issued a statement defending Iran’s right to self-defence under the UN Charter and warned of regional destabilisation. The backlash reflects a rapid shift from recent praise of Trump’s diplomacy.On June 22, the United States launched airstrikes targeting Iran’s nuclear infrastructure. Three critical sites — Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan — were struck using 30,000-pound GBU-57 “bunker buster” bombs, delivered by stealth B-2 bombers.On President Donald Trump’s orders, US Central Command carried out what the Pentagon described as a “deliberate and precise strike” to “severely degrade Iran’s nuclear weapons infrastructure.”“At approximately 6:40 PM EST, 2:10 am Iran time, the lead B-2 dropped GBU-57 MOP weapons on the first of several aim points at Fordow,” said General Dan Caine, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.The military operation followed Israel’s “Operation Rising Lion” on June 13 and Iran’s retaliatory “Operation True Promise 3.”","US Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a firm warning to Pakistan on Friday, saying that Iran must never be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons.

A Pakistan military officer who had claimed to have captured Indian Air Force pilot Abhinandan Varthaman was killed in a clash with Taliban militants in the Sararogha area of South Waziristan, near the Afghan border.According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Major Syed Moiz Abbas Shah was killed along with Lance Naik Jibran Ullah during an operation against Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters.ISPR added that the Pakistan Army killed 11 TTP militants and wounded seven others in the same operation.Major Moiz’s funeral prayers were held at Chaklala Garrison in Rawalpindi, with Pakistan Army Chief General Asim Munir in attendance.“Major Syed Moiz Abbas fought bravely in the face of resistance and ultimately laid down his life in the line of duty, upholding the highest traditions of bravery, sacrifice, and patriotism,” the ISPR statement quoted Munir as saying.His body was flown to his hometown of Chakwal in Punjab, where he was laid to rest with full military honours.A resurfaced clip of his old interview with Geo TV, now circulating on social media, shows Moiz — then a captain — detailing the events surrounding the capture of Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman.Varthaman had shot down a Pakistani F-16 fighter in February 2019 before his MiG-21 was hit and he was captured. He was held in Pakistan for three days before being released.The TTP, also known as the Pakistan Taliban, was formed in 2007 as an umbrella group of several militant outfits. Its primary aim is to impose a strict interpretation of Islamic law across Pakistan.Believed to have close ties with al-Qaeda, the TTP has been blamed for numerous deadly attacks in Pakistan, including the 2009 assault on army headquarters, attacks on military bases, and the 2008 bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad.Pakistan has described the TTP as “Fitna al-Khawarij,” referencing a historical Islamic sect known for violent rebellion.",Major Syed Moiz Abbas Shah was killed along with Lance Naik Jibran Ullah during an operation against Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters.

Is Pakistan building an ICBM?

What is ICBM?

Change in US strategy?





Another growing concern stems from Pakistan. US intelligence agencies have assessed that Pakistan is actively developing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of reaching the continental United States.According to a report by, the Pakistani military is pursuing a nuclear-armed ICBM, particularly in the wake of Operation Sindoor that took place in May.While Islamabad maintains that its nuclear program is aimed solely at deterring India—its conventionally superior neighbor—US intelligence agencies have assessed that Pakistan is actively developing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of reaching the continental United States.By pursuing such long-range capabilities, Pakistan may be attempting to deter potential US actions—whether a preemptive strike on its nuclear facilities or intervention in a future conflict with India.ICBM is a long-range missile with a reach exceeding 5,500 kilometers (3,400 miles), primarily designed to deliver nuclear payloads—typically one or more thermonuclear warheads. While ICBMs are theoretically capable of carrying conventional, chemical, or biological weapons, such payloads have never been operationally deployed on these systems.Modern ICBMs often feature multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs), enabling a single missile to deliver several warheads to different targets simultaneously.Countries currently known to possess operational ICBMs include the United States, Russia, China, France, the United Kingdom, India, Israel, and North Korea. Pakistan, despite being a nuclear-armed nation, remained the only such state without an ICBM capability.Advancements in missile technology, such as those seen in second- and third-generation systems like the US LGM-118 Peacekeeper, significantly increased accuracy, allowing ICBMs to hit even small, fortified targets with high reliability.ICBMs stand apart from other ballistic missile classes due to their extended range and faster speed. They surpass intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs), medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs), short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs), and tactical ballistic missiles in both capability and strategic impact.US officials have pointed out, the acquisition of ICBMs capable of targeting American territory would compel Washington to categorize Pakistan as a nuclear threat. Historically, no nation with such reach has been treated as an ally by the United States. In effect, the threat of nuclear escalation now shadows every region central to US strategic interests.While each emerging nuclear adversary—Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran—poses a significant threat on its own, the prospect of coordination or strategic collusion among them presents a far more alarming challenge.","According to a report by, the Pakistani military is pursuing a nuclear-armed ICBM.

Former Pakistan foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari issued a blunt warning Monday to India over its unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), saying Pakistan would not hesitate to respond if its water rights were violated. Speaking during the budget session of National Assembly, the Pakistan Peoples Party chairman said, “India has two options: share water fairly, or we will take it from all six rivers. ” He described India’s move to suspend the 1960 treaty after the terrorist attack in Pahalgam as both illegal and provocative.Bilawal argued there is no clause allowing unilateral withdrawal. “India’s claim that the treaty is in abeyance has no legal basis. According to the UN Charter, cutting off water is a form of aggression,” he said. He warned that if India pursued this course, it could lead to open conflict.“We do not want war, but if water is used as a weapon... Pakistan will be forced to act — and we are in a position to defeat India just as we have before,” he said.Bilawal urged India to resume dialogue, particularly on counterterrorism coordination. “Without engagement, violence will increase in both countries,” he warned, adding Pakistan’s own fight against terrorism had been undermined by Indian attempts to “politicise the issue”.","Bilawal Bhutto Zardari says Pakistan would not hesitate to respond if its water rights were violated.
