"Sub-quota a plot to divide & rule Dalits, allege SP veterans",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sub-quota-a-plot-to-divide-rule-dalits-allege-sp-veterans/articleshow/112450919.cms,"NEW DELHI: Samajwadi Party ’s Dalit functionaries have dubbed the proposal of sub-categorisation of Scheduled Castes a ploy to “divide and rule”, arguing that the party stands strongly for the unity of the community as prescribed by Ambedkar.Veteran MPs RK Chaudhary and Awadhesh Prasad told TOI that division of SCs into sub-groups will sound the death knell of Dalit unity, which cannot be accepted.“SP led by Akhilesh Yadav stands resolutely with the SC/ST community. SCs are one bloc and there should be no change in it,” he said.The views of the MP duo from Uttar Pradesh came as SP is positioning itself to tap into BSP’s support base which has diminished amid steady erosion of its Dalit base. Several BSP members have joined SP, with Chaudhary being a key figure from Kanshi Ram’s era. As Mayawati has come out strongly against the Supreme Court judgment on sub-categorisation and has historically stood for a single bloc of SCs, the views of SP’s Dalit brass are politically significant given its firm eyes on the fragmenting BSP vote bank.Chaudhary said Kanshi Ram played a big role in uniting Dalits across divisions and sub-catergorisation will be an assault on that unity. “Kanshi Ram believed they should unite and only with the united struggle of the ‘Bahujan Samaj’ which includes SC, ST and OBCs, can the community succeed in securing its participation (in the society),” he said.Prasad said Ambedkar enshrined in the Constitution the privilege for the entire SC community and “splitting them as Pasi, Raidas, Dhanuk, Koeri” will not work. Questioning the argument over affirmative action benefits being monopolized by some dominant sub-castes, Chaudhary said sub-categorisation is not the answer to the issue. “The Supreme Court has not studied the issue but decided according to the ‘mahaul’... nobody is stopping the other (weaker) sub-castes,” he said.",Samajwadi Party’s Dalit functionaries have dubbed the proposal of sub- categorisation of Scheduled Castes a ploy to “divide and rule” The party stands strongly for the unity of the community as prescribed by Ambedkar.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112450910,imgsize-319540,width-400,resizemode-4/112450910.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The semi-nude body of a second-year post-graduate female trainee doctor was found on August 9 (Friday) at R G Kar Medical College in Kolkata. Her body was recovered on Friday morning at 7:30 from a seminal hall of the hospital's emergency building.""Her body was found in the seminar hall at the emergency building by fellow students who informed us,"" a senior police officer said.The victim was on duty when the incident occured on Thursday night.Police formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the murder case and arrested a suspect, Sanjay Roy, on Saturday.Here's what we know so far about the incident:After an initial investigation, the police said that it was a case of murder. However, the victim's father alleged that her daughter was sexually assaulted before she was murdered. “I know that my daughter will never return. But let there be a proper investigation in the matter,” he said.The body bore injury marks with the clothes not in a proper condition. The body was sent for post-mortem examination. A preliminary post-mortem report also confirmed that the girl was raped and murdered inside the hospital. The report detailed numerous injuries on the victim's body. The report said, ""There was bleeding from both her eyes and mouth and injuries over the face. The victim was also bleeding from her private parts. She also has injuries in her belly, left leg... neck, in her right hand, ring finger and... lips."" A broken collar bone was also documented.Kolkata Police said they were waiting for the final post-mortem examination report to come to a conclusion regarding the murder. ""We are waiting for the final autopsy report to come to a conclusion in this case,"" a police officer was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.The Kolkata Police arrested an accused, Sanjay Roy, on Saturday. The accused was charged under sections 64 (rape) and 103 (murder) of BNS and was produced before Sealdah court, which remanded him to police custody till August 23.Based on circumstantial evidence and statements provided by doctors who were on night duty, the suspect has been charged with rape and murder, as stated by Kolkata Police Commissioner Vineet Goyal.Goyal while addressing the media, said, ""This is a heinous crime, and the arrested person is allegedly involved based on circumstantial evidence, including accounts of the other doctors present during night-duty hours.""Goyal said the force will ensure that the accused gets the maximum punishment if the charges are proved in court.West Bengal's chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, vowed on Saturday to seek the death penalty for the individual accused of the horrific sexual assault and murder. The announcement followed the swift arrest of the suspect.Despite her well-known opposition to the BJP's demands for central agency investigations into various corruption cases in Bengal, Banerjee stated that her administration would not object to a CBI probe if the students and the victim's family requested it.""If they do not trust the West Bengal government, they can approach any investigating agency; we have no objection,"" she said.Sanjay Roy was held barely six hours after a seven-member special investigation team (SIT) was set up. Roy, a civic volunteer, was recruited in 2019. Civic volunteers assist police officers in non-law enforcement capacities.Despite receiving compensation from the state, these volunteers are not formally recognized as members of the police force. Having been frequently assigned to the police outpost at RG Kar Hospital, Roy had unrestricted access to all departments within the hospital.His undoing was a damaged earphone discovered in the seminar room located on the third floor of the emergency building, where the body of the doctor was found in the early hours of Friday.CCTV footage captured Roy entering the emergency building at 4 am, wearing a Bluetooth device in his ears. However, when he departed the building after 40 minutes, the earphone was no longer present. According to the police, the device subsequently connected to Roy's mobile phone.Massive protests have erupted among junior doctors and medical professionals in medical colleges and hospitals across the West Bengal following the alleged rape and murder in Kolkata.

NEW DELHI: Resident doctors at major govt hospitals across Delhi are set to indefinitely halt all elective services starting Monday to protest the brutal rape and murder of a resident doctor in Kolkata.

Today it happened in Bengal, tomorrow it could be Delhi, or any other part of the nation,” he added.RDAs of Maulana Azad Medical College, RML Hospital, Lady Hardinge Medical College, Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital and GTB Hospital have also announced the suspension of elective services.The body of the 32-year-old woman was found on Thursday night in the seminar hall of RG Kar Medical College & Hospital.

There are reports of locals being coerced or lured by terrorists to help them navigate the terrain. Operation to hunt down terrorists, who escaped deep into the jungles, continued despite heavy rain & challenging landscape of Ahlan Gagarmandu.According to officials, three to four “highly trained Pakistani men” suspected to be from banned Jaish-e-Mohammed were involved in the attack on a security search team that was in pursuit of terrorists spotted in Kapran Garol in Kokernag.The terrorists crossed Pir Panjal’s Kishtwar range and entered south Kashmir on Aug 5, escaping a manhunt in Doda district of Jammu division following an attack on July 15 that left four soldiers dead, officials said.On Saturday, the terrorists were sighted in Ahlan Gagarmandu forest, Anantnag.

Judiciary coup?



Students besieged premises



Chief justice Obaidul Hassan of the Bangladesh Supreme Court resigned from his position on Saturday, following protests by students who demanded the resignation of the chief justice and judges of the Appellate Division by 1 pm, as reported by media outlets.""I feel it is necessary to share a special news with you. Our chief justice has resigned a few minutes back.His resignation letter has already reached the law ministry. We will send it to the president without delay for taking necessary measures,"" Asif Nazrul, law, justice and parliamentary affairs adviser to the interim government, said in a facebook post.Obaidul Hassan, the chief justice of the Supreme Court, was instructed to resign by demonstrators who assembled near the court building in Dhaka, the nation's capital. Hassan, who was selected to lead the Supreme Court last year, is perceived as a Hasina loyalist.The protests in Bangladesh were initially sparked after the high court reinstated a job quota system that allocated a substantial portion of government jobs to certain groups, including 30% for descendants of veterans from the 1971 liberation war.This decision was viewed as favoring supporters of the ruling Awami League party, which has been in power since 2009. The reinstatement of these quotas, which had been abolished in 2018 due to widespread protests, ignited anger among students and job seekers who felt that merit-based opportunities were being denied to them.On July 4, chief justice Obaidul Hasan had made remarks during the hearing of the Appellate Division on the high court verdict on quota saying, “Why have so many movements begun on streets? Will you change the verdicts of the high court and the Supreme by exerting pressure through the movement?”Initially, chief justice Hassan called for a full court meeting with all justices from both divisions of the Supreme Court. However, the protesting students perceived this as a judiciary coup and announced their intention to besiege the High Court premises. In response to the student protest, Chief Justice Hassan postponed the meeting and later announced his decision to step down.The chief justice announced his decision after protesters from the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement gathered at the court premises. Hasnat Abdullah, a coordinator of the movement, issued an ultimatum calling for the resignation of the chief justice and the justices of the Appellate Division, threatening to besiege their residences if their demands were not met, as reported by The Daily Star.Asif Nazrul, serving as the law advisor to the interim government, addressed journalists at the Secretariat. ""We hope the chief justice will understand when a demand for resignation comes from the mass movement and how to honour that demand,"" Prothomolo quoted Nazrul as saying.As hundreds of protesting students gathered at the Supreme Court premises, Bangladesh Army personnel were deployed to maintain order.The army personnel were stationed in the main building, annexe building, and other areas around the Supreme Court. They urged the protesters to maintain peace and refrain from damaging government property.Following the resignation of prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who fled to India on Monday amid political turmoil in Bangladesh, 84-year-old Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus was sworn in as the head of an interim government on Thursday.His government is expected to announce fresh elections after restoring law and order, following the deadly anti-government demonstrations against the Hasina government that had led to widespread violence, which is now subsiding.","Chief justice Obaidul Hassan of the Bangladesh Supreme Court resigned from his position on Saturday.

Neighbors described feeling and hearing the early morning blast that damaged a number of surrounding houses in Bel Air , a town about about 30 miles (50 kilometers) northeast of Baltimore.Firefighters were called to the area around 6:40 am for a report of a gas leak and an outdoor odor of gas, said Oliver Alkire, a master deputy with the State Fire Marshal's Office .Alkire said that as firefighters were approaching, they began receiving calls that the house had exploded. First responders pronounced one person dead at the scene.Alkire said that a home next door to the explosion was heavily damaged, and a woman in that house was treated for injuries on the scene. At least one utility worker on the scene was also injured. Two utility workers were in the area to work on a reported electrical issue, but authorities didn't immediately say if that was related to the explosion.Investigators are working to establish how many houses were damaged and how far the blast radius was. Firefighters were continuing to search the debris for other possible victims of the blast. Authorities said there was no ongoing threat to the public.""I've been on the job for nearly 18 years, and this is one of the largest explosions I've seen,"" Alkire said, noting that investigators will document damage to nearby homes.A photo posted by county officials showed several firefighters around the rubble of the home with another damaged home in the background. Charred pieces of wood were heaped on the property, and insulation and splintered wood spilled out into the street. Small pieces of debris hung from nearby trees. Later in the morning, emergency workers were seen using heavy equipment to search through the rubble.Alkire said the house that blew up was for sale, but it wasn't clear if it was still occupied.More than 60 first responders came to the scene from multiple agencies. The state fire marshal, sheriff and federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms were assisting with the probe, as is standard procedure.Lisa Czawlytko, who lives in a nearby condominium, said the explosion woke her and her three children and knocked a pet bird to the ground.She said the roof structure on four condominium buildings buckled and sent aluminum siding from the roof down to the ground. She attended a news conference at a nearby library to ask officials if it was safe to be in the building.She said she felt the force of the explosion.""The whole building shook like a major earthquake,"" she said in an interview.Her 8-year-old daughter described it as scary, when her mother asked her how she felt when it happened .""I thought a bomb dropped,"" Myca said.The blast woke up Greg Clifford from a heavy sleep inside his townhouse about a block away. He first thought that a tree had fallen on his deck, or that a lightning strike caused the loud noise.""It just shook the whole thing,"" Clifford said. ""It was crazy loud.""He also noted some damage to his home.""The window in my bedroom is pulled away from the framing of the house,"" Clifford said. ""I mean, I can look straight down to my deck. My basement door - the glass - it didn't shatter, but it blew in, and my frame's all cracked out.""","At least one person died and two were injured after a house exploded in Bel Air, Maryland.

CCP vows action against inflated pay-parking fees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/ccp-vows-action-against-inflated-pay-parking-fees/articleshow/112448900.cms,"Panaji:

Following complaints of corporators accusing parking wardens of overcharging tourists in the city, mayor Rohit Monserrate said CCP will not condone the alleged unlawful activities and will take stringent measures against those involved. Contractor Sohan Juwarkar will be asked to dismiss the wardens found overcharging.Several corporators at the last council meeting have accused pay parking wardens of overcharging tourists due to no proper signages displaying parking fees.They said that the signboards were absent at most locations, and in some cases, were intentionally damaged. They alleged that the wardens “fleece” tourists. Corporator Vasant Agshikar said that not only tourists but also people from outside the city are allegedly overcharged.Uday Madkaikar, former mayor and senior corporator, has alleged a breach of the pay parking contract’s terms and conditions. He said that without signboards displaying parking rates, collecting pay-parking fees is not permitted.Madkaikar stated, “If you check, you will find that the boards are there but the portion where rates are mentioned has been removed. I have asked the CCP to take action and ensure that the rates are prominently displayed at all designated pay parking areas, especially in tourist spots, to prevent wardens from overcharging visitors.”Monserrate said that CCP will not condone the alleged unlawful activities and will take stringent action against those involved. He stated that the corporation will direct the contractor to dismiss pay parking wardens who are found to be overcharging tourists or locals.“Before we re-sign any agreement, we will ensure the boards are put up first. If any pay parking warden is charging extra money, we will write to the contractor to terminate them.” he said. “They wear uniforms bearing the corporation logo, and it looks like we (CCP)are taking money. So, we will take strict action,” he further said.Monserrate added that the St Inez church area will not be covered under pay-parking, as it is considered a religious place.","Several corporators have accused pay parking wardens of overcharging tourists due to no proper signages displaying parking fees.

Pelosi says Biden’s letter on 2024 presidential race 'didn't sound like Joe...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pelosi-says-bidens-letter-on-2024-presidential-race-didnt-sound-like-joe-/articleshow/112449439.cms,"US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , in an interview with New York Times podcast said that President Joe Biden ’s letter from last month, which reaffirmed his intention to remain in the 2024 presidential race , ""didn’t sound like"" him.""I mean, there are some people who are unhappy with the letter. Let me say it differently. Some said that some people were unhappy with the letter.I’ll put it in somebody else’s mouth. It didn’t sound like Joe Biden to me. It really didn’t,"" Pelosi said during an interview with Ezra Klein on the podcast.""I didn’t accept the letter as anything but a letter,"" she added.Joe Biden on July 8 addressed a letter to Democratic congressmen following a fumbling debate performance that raised doubts about his ability to win the election. In the letter, he said: ""The debate about me running is over. I’m running. I was voted for by 14 million people in the Democratic primary. Are you trying to take away their voice? We’re done with this.”Despite this initial stance, Biden eventually yielded to the ongoing pressure from his supporters and stepped down from his position and cleared the path for Vice President Kamala Harris to assume the role of leading the Democratic ticket in the upcoming election.The letter came up when Klein questioned Pelosi about her widely-discussed appearance on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe."" In that interview, the former speaker expressed her support for whichever decision Biden made regarding his political future.Pelosi said: ""I wanted to see a campaign that could win. Because I had made a decision that I stayed in Congress to defeat what’s his name, because I think he is a danger to our country. It’s not like a Bob Dole or a George Bush or something like that, where you have a difference of opinion,"" New York Times reported.Pelosi said that she wanted to use her appearance on ""Morning Joe""to urge, ""Stop saying things,""as NATO leaders were gathering in Washington, DC, that week.""If you have something to say, save it for later, until they’re gone. ""Because this is a big deal the summit of NATO, which he has strengthened, grown, and now is hosting. And they’re doing great things, and he’s the center of it all. Save your comments for later,"" Pelosi added.In a recent CBS interview , Biden, after exiting the US presidential race, specifically mentioned Pelosi as he explained his reasons for ending his re-election bid.""A number of my Democratic colleagues in the House and Senate thought that I was going to hurt them in the races. And I was concerned if I stayed in the race, that would be the topic — you’d be interviewing me about why did Nancy Pelosi say [something] … and I thought it’d be a real distraction,""he said.""When I ran the first time, I thought of myself as being a transition president. I can’t even say how old I am — it’s hard for me to get out of my mouth,""he added.The statement aligns with journalist Seymour Hersh's report, which claimed that Barack Obama threatened Joe Biden with the 25th Amendment, asserting that he had ""Kamala's approval"" to remove him from the race, Collin Rugg said in a post on X.","US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that President Joe Biden’s letter from last month, which reaffirmed his intention to remain in the 2024 presidential race, ""didn't sound like"" him.

KOLKATA: Disowning her brother, Sanjay Roy - arrested for the brutal rape and murder of the RG Kar Hospital 's trainee doctor - the accused's sister , an assistant sub-inspector with Kolkata Police , on Sunday demanded the harshest possible punishment for his crimes.""Do whatever you want to do with him, please do not bring his body back home. We will not receive it.No one can have a relationship with such an inhuman,"" she told reporters.The sister, who refused to be identified due to the nature of her job, said she had severed all ties with him long ago due to his excessive drinking and violent behaviour. ""I have no relation with him and never want to have any,"" she stated in response to questions about the allegations against her brother.Sanjay Roy, the family said, had a history of troubling behaviour. He was married four times, with the recent one solemnized in Feb, 2022. ""We were unaware of his previous marriages and abusive tendencies. Sanjay's violent nature came to light when he kicked my three months pregnant sister in the stomach, leading to the death of their unborn child,"" said the sister of Sanjay's fourth wife.Tragically, his wife was later diagnosed with blood cancer and admitted to NRS Hospital for six months, where she eventually died.

What caused Brazil plane crash that killed 62 people? Explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/what-caused-brazil-plane-crash-that-killed-62-people-explained/articleshow/112454218.cms,"Preliminary investigation and black box recovery

Crash circumstances

Potential causes and expert opinions

Weather conditions:

Engine failure:

Multiple factors:

An ATR-72 turboprop operated by regional carrier Voepass crashed in a residential area near Sao Paulo on Friday, resulting in the deaths of all 62 passengers. The aircraft was en route from Cascavel to Sao Paulo when it went down around 1:30 pm local time in Vinhedo, roughly 80 km (50 miles) northwest of the city.Brazil's aviation accident investigation center, Cenipa, has recovered the plane's black box, which includes crucial voice recordings and flight data.A preliminary report is expected within 30 days, according to Cenipa's head. The aircraft reportedly lost radar contact at 1:22 pm after failing to respond to communication attempts, with no emergency signals sent by the crew.Witness videos show clear skies before the plane began a spiraling descent. Experts are now scrutinizing several factors to determine the cause of the crash.US aviation safety expert Anthony Brickhouse noted that investigators will examine the weather conditions and the aircraft's engine and control systems. Preliminary analyses suggest ice buildup could have played a role. Voepass had predicted ice at the altitude where the plane was flying, though it was expected to be manageable. Brazilian aviation engineer Celso Faria de Souza is inclined to believe ice was a significant factor based on video evidence. ATR-72 planes have had past issues with icing, including a fatal 1994 crash in Indiana and a 2016 incident in Norway.MIT professor John Hansman reviewed footage of the crash and suggested that engine failure, rather than weather, might be to blame. He proposed that a malfunction on one side of the engine could have led to the plane's downward rotation if not properly managed by the crew.Robert A Clifford, an attorney who has handled similar cases, pointed out that air crashes often result from a combination of factors, including ice, engine failure, and human error.As the investigation continues, authorities and experts will work to piece together the exact circumstances leading to this tragic event.","The ATR-72 turboprop crashed in a residential area near Sao Paulo on Friday, resulting in the deaths of all 62 passengers.

"US elections: How will 40,000 black men’s support impact Kamala Harris’ campaign?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-elections-how-will-40000-black-mens-support-impact-kamala-harris-campaign/articleshow/112453301.cms,"A day after Vice President Kamala Harris declared her intention to seek the Democratic presidential nomination, over 40,000 Black men participated in a virtual fundraising call, exploring the critical support they could offer her campaign.The four-hour call featured influential Black figures, including politicians, activists, and entertainers, who discussed the challenges Harris would face, particularly the anticipated racist and sexist attacks from opponents.Many participants shared personal stories of their relationships with Harris and pledged their support.Kwame Raoul, Illinois Attorney General, addressed a crucial issue: “Sometimes as Black men we get confused as to what strength is, and sometimes we think that standing behind a Black woman as a leader does not display strength as Black men.” Raoul emphasized that supporting Harris demonstrates strength, not weakness. “I’m standing behind a Black woman to be president of the United States, and it doesn’t make me any less of a Black man,” he asserted, reported NYT.The call underscored the importance of rallying support from a key Democratic constituency—Black men—who have historically been skeptical of Black women in high-ranking positions. Although Black men have reliably supported Democrats, some remain hesitant to back Black women for top roles, a trend with potential implications for Harris' bid.Moya Bailey, a Northwestern University professor, highlighted the unique challenges faced by Black women in leadership roles. “Patriarchy is not unique to the Black population, but the consequences are much higher,” she was quoted as saying by NYT, pointing to a historical reluctance among some Black men to support Black female leaders.The call’s tone resonated with past efforts by Black female politicians like Shirley Chisholm and Stacey Abrams, who faced similar skepticism. Chisholm, the first Black woman elected to Congress, encountered resistance from Black male colleagues when she sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1972. Abrams’ “Stacey and the Fellas” gatherings aimed to address concerns about her support among Black men during her 2022 gubernatorial run in Georgia.Harris faces additional challenges stemming from her past as a prosecutor, which has led to criticism from some Black men who feel disillusioned by the Democratic Party’s actions on their priorities. Polls have shown a disconnect between Black voters and the Democratic Party, with some Black men voting for Trump in recent elections.Harris' campaign advisers recognize that Trump’s appeal to Black men could impact their support for Harris. Trump has made contentious claims, including that Harris recently began identifying as Black for political gain. This rhetoric, along with Trump’s marketing strategies, has further complicated Harris' efforts to connect with Black male voters.Marc Morial, president of the National Urban League, urged Black men to support Harris, emphasizing her qualifications and experience. “An African American male has to talk in the community to African American women about why he would pick Trump over an African American woman,” Morial said.While Harris has made strides in engaging Black men, including organizing meetings with leaders and addressing their concerns, W. Mondale Robinson, founder of the Black Male Voter Project, noted ongoing challenges. “Everything she says will be looked at with a side eye from Black men because there’s a lack of trust in politicians,” Robinson said.Despite these hurdles, some observers believe Harris' candidacy represents progress. Jason Nichols, a senior lecturer in African American studies, noted that while Black men might not see themselves as clearly in Harris as they did in Barack Obama, they recognize the significance of her candidacy. “You see the community coming together to vote their best interest — which, in this case, is a Black woman,” Nichols said.","Over 40,000 Black men participated in a virtual fundraising call, exploring the critical support they could offer Vice President Kamala Harris. The call underscored the importance of rallying support from a key Democratic constituency—Black men. Some Black men have historically been skeptical of Black women in high-ranking positions.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112453403,imgsize-74806,width-400,resizemode-4/112453403.jpg"

Often called ""tidal waves,"" tsunamis are among the most powerful natural disasters in recorded human history. In contrast to ordinary ocean waves, tsunamis are caused by abrupt, large-scale events in or close to a body of water, such landslides, undersea earthquakes, or volcanic eruptions. These disturbances produce waves that move across oceans with enormous force and speed, becoming taller as they get closer to shallow coastal regions.The sheer force of tsunamis has the potential to completely destroy infrastructure, wreak havoc on coastal populations, and result in a high death toll. Because of their unparalleled devastation, several tsunamis have left enduring impressions on history over the ages. Here are the top 10 deadliest tsunamis ever recorded in human history.The Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami of March 11, 2011, hit Japan with a magnitude of 9.0. This tsunami caused catastrophic damage to Japan's northeastern coast and led to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. The tsunami caused extensive economic damage and nuclear fallout.On December 26, 2004, one of the deadliest tsunamis in recorded history struck the Indian Ocean. Triggered by a massive undersea earthquake with a magnitude of 9.1-9.3, it affected countries such as Indonesia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, India, and several others. The tsunami resulted in entire communities being washed away.On December 26, 2003, a tsunami struck the coast of Iran following a magnitude 6.6 earthquake near Bam. The tsunami, combined with the earthquake's impact, led to the destruction of Bam and surrounding areas.The Valdivia earthquake, also known as the Great Chilean Earthquake, occurred on May 22, 1960, with a magnitude of 9.5, the strongest ever recorded. The tsunami affected Chile and spread across the Pacific Ocean, causing deaths in places as far away as Hawaii and Japan.On November 4, 1952, an earthquake with a magnitude of 9.0 struck the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia. The resulting tsunami affected the Pacific Ocean, reaching as far as Hawaii and causing significant damage in the region.On December 28, 1908, an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 struck the Strait of Messina between Sicily and mainland Italy. The resulting tsunami caused massive destruction in Messina and Reggio Calabria, killing an estimated 123,000 people. This event remains one of the deadliest tsunamis in European history.A magnitude 8.5 earthquake struck off the coast of Japan’s Sanriku region on June 15, 1896, triggering a massive tsunami. The waves hit the Japanese coast with enormous force, causing widespread destruction and killing many people. This event is often remembered for its sheer scale and impact on the local population.On August 13, 1868, a powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 8.5 struck off the coast of Peru. The resulting tsunami devastated coastal towns in Peru and Chile, particularly Arica (now in Chile). The waves were reported to have reached as far away as Hawaii.Following the earthquake of March 5, 1783, in Southern Italy, a tsunami struck the coast of Calabria. The earthquake, with a magnitude of around 7.9, triggered a tsunami that resulted in significant destruction and loss of life, with estimates of up to 50,000 deaths in the affected regions.Following the Lisbon earthquake on November 1, 1755, a devastating tsunami hit Portugal and its colonies. With an estimated magnitude of 8.5-9.0, the tsunami ravaged Lisbon and other Portuguese coastal cities, resulting in approximately 10,000-100,000 deaths","Tsunamis are among the most powerful natural disasters in recorded human history.

DHAKA : The head of Bangladesh’s interim govt , “chief adviser” Prof Muhammad Yunus , condemned on Saturday the attacks on minority communities , calling them “heinous”. “Are they not people of this country? You have been able to save the country, can’t you save some families,” he asked as the Hindu community held its biggest street demonstration yet, seeking safety and security and calling for justice.“You must say—no one can harm them. They are my brothers; we fought together, and we will stay together,” Prof Yunus said during a session with students at Begum Rokeya University. He urged students to protect all Hindu, Christian, and Buddhist families from harm.Thousands of protesters demonstrated in major cities like Dhaka, Chattogram, Barisal, Tangail and Kurigram saying that Hindus have a right to live in Bangladesh.They blocked the Shahbagh intersection in Dhaka for the second consecutive day on Saturday to protest against attacks on homes, shops, and temples in various parts of the country following the ousting of the Sheikh Hasina-led govt.“August 2024: Save Bangladeshi Hindus. We Want Justice and Safety,” read a placard held by a young woman. Others chanted slogans like “Save the Hindus”, “Why are my temples and homes being looted? We want answers”, “Hindu persecution in independent Bangladesh, it will not continue”, “Religion is for individuals, the state is for everyone”, and “Ensure the safety of Hindus”.The Hindu minorities demonstrating in Shahbag demanded security for the Hindus and their homes, temples and businesses, the arrest of those who perpetrated violence against them, and compensation for vandalism, loot and torture.Members of minority communities in Bangladesh faced at least 205 incidents of attacks in 52 districts since the ousting of the Sheikh Hasina-led govt on Aug 5, according to two Hindu organisations — Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council and the Bangladesh Puja Udjapan Parishad — in the country.

The couple's joint appearance, their first since the explosive Oprah Winfrey interview, has been branded a ""car crash"" amid allegations of behind-the-scenes tension and anger, as reported by The Mirror.During a recent appearance on GB News, Royal author Angela Levin shared her take on Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's latest interview, claiming that the Duchess of Sussex was ""screaming"" and ""very annoyed"" after the cameras stopped rolling, the Mirror reported.During the CBS Sunday Morning interview, the couple intended to discuss online harm and their philanthropic endeavors. However, the conversation took an unexpected turn when Meghan was questioned about her previously disclosed suicidal thoughts, which she reportedly did not expect. Royal author Angela Levin claims that Markle was visibly upset by the line of questioning, revealing a tense atmosphere that persisted off-camera.""After the interview was over, she was apparently screaming at the producers, very, very annoyed at what they had asked her,"" Levin said on Dan Wootton's show. ""You mustn't do that with Meghan because she's in control. But you could see she couldn't contain her anger, her fury,” she added.Observers and body language experts noted a palpable sense of discomfort between the couple during the interview, according to body language expert Judi James. Harry appeared either bored or distracted, and Meghan’s icy stares seemed to convey dissatisfaction whenever he spoke. Broadcaster Dan Wootton remarked, “It certainly wasn’t a good 43rd birthday for the Duchess of Sussex, was it?”Levin further emphasized the strain in their dynamic, saying, ""Just the same as in and out of the interview, she couldn't stand Harry speaking. She would look at him with such harsh eyes and such a terrible expression on her face because she didn't want him to talk, I imagine. He is really lost at the moment... I think that he's in a very, very bad way.""The interview, which was meant to mark a fresh start in their public engagement, has instead raised questions about the couple’s relationship dynamics and their handling of media scrutiny. Branding it a “car crash,” Wootton commented on the failed attempt at damage control, noting the couple's awkward chemistry despite their united front.","Royal author Angela Levin claims that Meghan Markle was ""screaming"" and ""very annoyed"" after the CBS Sunday Morning interview.

US elections: Kamala Harris and Donald Trump to face off in prime-time debate on September 10,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-elections-kamala-harris-and-donald-trump-to-face-off-in-prime-time-debate-on-september-10/articleshow/112389058.cms,"Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are set to meet in a highly anticipated prime-time debate on September 10, as announced by ABC News on Thursday. This 90-minute showdown, expected to be held in Philadelphia, marks a pivotal moment in an unpredictable presidential campaign that has already seen significant twists and turns.The debate will be moderated by ABC anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis. Although the exact format and ground rules are still being finalized, it is likely that the event will proceed without a live audience, according to sources familiar with the plans.Notably, Trump had proposed three debates with major networks - September 4 with Fox News, September 10 with NBC, and September 25 with ABC. However, Harris has agreed to participate only in the September 10 debate with NBC. Harris has not yet provided reasons for declining the other proposed dates.This announcement follows Trump's initial agreement to debate President Joe Biden on the same date, an arrangement made months ago. However, after Biden's unexpected withdrawal from the race, Trump questioned the validity of that commitment with Harris, leading to uncertainty over whether the debate would take place.Recent events, including Biden's exit and an assassination attempt on Trump, have drawn renewed attention to the presidential race, which had initially been shaping up as a repeat of the 2020 election. The upcoming ABC debate is expected to serve as a critical moment in the campaign's final stretch leading up to the election.Trump has also indicated his willingness to engage in additional debates with Harris, proposing events hosted by NBC News and Fox News. However, the Harris campaign has not yet agreed to these additional debates. NBC News is reportedly in discussions with both campaigns about a potential debate on September 25, but Harris has not committed to participating. Similarly, no agreement has been reached for a debate hosted by Fox News.","The debate will be moderated by ABC anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis.

US orders missile submarine move to Middle East amid rising Israel-Iran tensions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-orders-missile-submarine-move-to-middle-east-amid-rising-israel-iran-tensions/articleshow/112453468.cms,"US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has directed the deployment of a guided missile submarine to the Middle East , the Pentagon announced on Sunday. This move comes as the region braces for potential retaliation following the recent assassinations of senior members of Hamas and Hezbollah.The USS Georgia, a nuclear-powered submarine, was already stationed in the Mediterranean Sea in July, according to a US military social media post.The Pentagon's decision to publicly announce the submarine's deployment is notable for its rarity.Following a conversation with his Israeli counterpart, Austin also ordered the Abraham Lincoln strike group to expedite its deployment to the region. “Secretary Austin reiterated the United States’ commitment to defend Israel and emphasized the enhancement of US military force posture and capabilities throughout the Middle East due to escalating regional tensions,” the Pentagon statement read.In addition to the submarine deployment, the US military plans to send extra fighter jets and Navy warships to the Middle East to strengthen Israeli defenses.The recent escalation was triggered by the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Iran-backed Hamas, in Tehran on July 31. This attack has led to threats of retaliation from Iran against Israel, which is engaged in conflict with Hamas in Gaza. Iran has accused Israel of the killing, although Israel has not claimed responsibility.The situation was further exacerbated by the death of Fuad Shukr, a senior military commander of Hezbollah, in an Israeli strike on Beirut. This has heightened fears that the Gaza conflict may expand into a broader Middle East war.Iran has accused the US of complicity in Haniyeh's assassination due to its support for Israel.Amid these rising tensions, Reuters reported that several US and coalition personnel were injured in a drone attack in Syria on Friday, marking the second significant attack on US forces in recent days.","The USS Georgia, a nuclear-powered submarine, was already stationed in the Mediterranean Sea in July, according to a US military social media post.

On Friday, Microsoft released a report revealing that a hacking group linked to Iran’s Revolutionary Guard had breached the account of a former senior adviser to a presidential campaign.This breach was followed by a spear-phishing attempt aimed at a high-ranking official within the same campaign.Former President Donald Trump responded swiftly to the news, claiming that his campaign had been targeted by Iranian hackers . Trump, who has often highlighted his aggressive policies toward Iran as a testament to his strength, used the incident to criticize the Biden administration , describing it as ""Weak and Ineffective.""The attack, which Microsoft attributed to the group Mint Sandstorm, raises concerns about the security of the 2024 election. While Trump downplayed the breach, saying that only ""publicly available information"" was accessed, the full extent of the damage remains unclear.In a parallel development, Politico reported on Saturday that it had obtained internal documents from the Trump campaign, leading to speculation about whether these were linked to the Iranian hack or resulted from a separate leak. The New York Times also received a similar trove of data, further complicating the narrative around the incident.The timing of these events has reignited fears about foreign influence in US elections, particularly from Iran, which has a history of animosity towards Trump. His administration’s withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal and the 2020 assassination of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani have made Trump a key target for Tehran.As investigations continue, the hacking attempts underscore the ongoing vulnerabilities in the US political landscape, with the potential for further foreign interference as the 2024 election approaches.","Microsoft reports that a hacking group linked to Iran’s Revolutionary Guard breached the account of a former senior adviser to a presidential campaign.

Face the Nation

In a series of interviews on Sunday, Senator JD Vance of Ohio, the Republican vice-presidential nominee , reiterated his stance that Democrats are “anti-family” and defended former President Donald Trump’s position on abortion policies .During the interviews on CNN , CBS, and ABC News, Vance clarified his controversial past comments where he had criticized ""childless cat ladies"" and suggested that parents should have more influence in the democratic process than individuals without children.He emphasized that his criticism was directed at the policies of the Democratic Party, not at the personal lives of Democrats. Vance described the notion of allowing children the right to vote, controlled by their parents, as a ""thought experiment"" rather than a serious proposal.“I’m pro-family,” Vance stated on CNN’s. “I want us to have more families. And obviously sometimes it doesn’t work out, sometimes for medical reasons, sometimes because you don’t meet the right person. But the point is that our country has become anti-family in its public policy.”Vance also addressed a recent moment where Trump gave a confusing response to a question about whether he would direct the FDA to revoke its approval of the abortion drug mifepristone. On CBS’s, Vance suggested that Trump might not have fully understood the question at the time. He added, “He just wants to make sure that drugs are safe and effective before they’re out there in the market, and of course that doctors are properly controlling this stuff so that people don’t get hurt.”Despite Vance’s defense, the safety of mifepristone and misoprostol, another drug commonly used in conjunction with it, has been confirmed by more than 100 scientific studies.In his CNN interview, Vance was again asked about Trump’s stance on mifepristone. He referenced Trump’s support for a Supreme Court ruling during a June presidential debate, which maintained access to the drug. When interviewer Dana Bash highlighted that the court’s decision was based on the plaintiffs’ lack of standing rather than the substance of the case, Vance reiterated that Trump supports leaving abortion policy decisions to individual states, despite the fact that states have no control over FDA drug approvals.","JD Vance, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, gave a series of interviews on Sunday.

Whipsawed by Events

Struggling to Frame the Attack

Griping About Circumstances, but Not Staff

The August 2 dinner at the Bridgehampton, New York, home of Howard Lutnick, the Cantor Fitzgerald CEO, was a high-powered affair. Among the roughly 130 people who dined under an air-conditioned tent were some of Donald Trump 's wealthiest supporters, including billionaire hedge fund financier Bill Ackman, who sat next to the former president, and Omeed Malik, the president of another fund, 1789 Capital.Some guests hoped Trump would signal that he was recalibrating after a series of damaging mistakes. He did not.Before the dinner, answering a question that voiced concerns about the upcoming election during a small roundtable discussion inside Lutnick's house, Trump said, ""We've got to stop the steal,"" reviving yet again his false claims about the 2020 election -- claims that his advisers have urged him to drop because they don't help him with swing voters.According to two people present, Trump also brought up his remark, made two days earlier at a gathering of the National Association of Black Journalists, in which he had questioned Vice President Kamala Harris ' racial identity.It had been a display of flagrant race-baiting that was egregious even by Trump's standards, and it instantly reprogrammed America's TV news chyrons: He falsely claimed that Harris had only recently decided to identify as Black for political purposes.But Trump showed no regret. ""I think I was right,"" he told the rattled donors that Friday night.Later, at dinner under the tent, Harrison LeFrak, the scion of a New York real estate family, whose father is an old friend of Trump's, asked how Trump planned to take the narrative back from Democrats, and what his positive vision for the country would be. It appeared to be a request for reassurance.Trump provided none. Instead, he criticized Harris on a range of fronts, before adding: ""I am who I am.""The fundraiser came amid a stretch of flailing and self-harm that began after President Joe Biden 's July 21 withdrawal from the race and endorsement of Harris to succeed him. Close Trump allies have described this as the rockiest period of Trump's campaign -- and easily the worst since a late 2022 spree in which he mused about terminating parts of the Constitution and dined at Mar-a-Lago with a white supremacist and an outspoken antisemite.Since then, Trump has picked fights with allies publicly and privately, including a broadside against Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia at an Atlanta rally -- the kind of mean-spirited public attack on a popular Republican that his own allies believe helped sink two Senate races in Georgia in January 2021 and could harm Trump in the state, a vital battleground in November.This story is based on interviews with more than a dozen people close to Trump, nearly all of whom insisted on anonymity to describe private discussions and events.As Harris -- long ridiculed and underestimated -- has transformed the contest, campaigning energetically and drawing roughly even with Trump in many polls, Trump has responded with one unforced error after another while struggling to land on an effective and consistent argument against her.He has found the change disorienting, those who interact with him say. Trump had grown comfortable campaigning against an 81-year-old incumbent who struggled to navigate stairs, thoughts and sentences. Suddenly, he finds himself in a race against a Black woman nearly 20 years younger, one who has made history and who is drawing large and excited crowds.The people around Trump see a candidate knocked off his bearings, nothing like the man who reclined serenely July 15 as he watched as thousands of delegates cheered him on the first night of the Republican National Convention. Then, Trump, his ear bandaged, was a living martyr after the assassination attempt two days before. Inside the Milwaukee arena, the Democrats had been defeated; the only thing left to wonder about was the margin of Trump's victory.In a statement in response to the reporting for this story, a spokesperson, Brian Hughes, said that Trump ""continues to run a winning campaign and has built a movement focused on making our nation great again."" Another spokesperson, Steven Cheung, insisted Trump had put forward a ""positive"" vision for the country that contrasted with ""the dangerously liberal policies"" of Biden and Harris.But to Trump's close allies, that first night in Milwaukee now seems a foggy memory, as if it never happened.At the Aug. 2 dinner, Trump told donors that the news media had been incorrectly suggesting that he had mellowed since the assassination attempt. ""I'm not nicer,"" he said, according to one person in attendance.Another said Trump described himself as ""angry,"" because ""they"" -- unspecified adversaries that the attendee took to mean Democrats -- had first tried to bankrupt him and then to kill him.Indeed, Trump has often been in a foul mood the past few weeks. He has ranted about Harris. He has called her ""nasty,"" on ""Fox & Friends,"" and a ""bitch,"" repeatedly, in private, according to two people who heard the remark on different occasions. (""That is not language President Trump has used to describe Kamala, and it's not how the campaign would characterize her,"" Cheung said.)His quickness to anger has left him susceptible to manipulation, even among close allies.A week before the Hamptons fundraiser, on July 25, Trump stunned one of his wealthiest patrons, Miriam Adelson, the widow of casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, by having an aide, Natalie Harp, fire off a series of angry text messages to Adelson in Trump's name, according to three people with knowledge of what took place.The texts were particularly jarring because Adelson and Trump had a friendly meeting just a week earlier at the Republican National Convention, according to a person briefed on the matter.The texts complained about the people running Adelson's super political action committee, Preserve America, into which she is pouring millions of dollars to support Trump.At the time, Preserve America was spending nearly $18 million on a week's worth of ads aiding Trump in three battleground states. The texts said that the officials running Preserve America were ""RINOs"" -- Republicans in name only -- and that Adelson's late husband would never have tolerated that, the people said.According to two of the people, aides to Adelson later discovered that the outburst against her had been encouraged by another major Trump donor, Ike Perlmutter, the former chair of Marvel Entertainment, who had hoped in vain that Adelson would contribute to a rival super PAC that he backs. (A lawyer for Perlmutter did not respond to an email seeking comment, and an adviser to Adelson, Andy Abboud, declined to comment.)The text messages prompted concerns -- as yet unrealized -- that Adelson might scale back her support of Trump.Over the past two weeks, Trump has fielded complaints from donors about his running mate , JD Vance, as news coverage exploring Vance's past statements unearthed -- and then exhaustively critiqued -- remarks including a lament that America was run by ""childless cat ladies.""Trump dismissed out of hand donors' suggestions that he replace Vance on the ticket. But Trump privately asked his advisers whether they had known about Vance's comments about childless women before Trump chose him.And, at the Aug. 2 fundraiser, according to two people with knowledge of what took place, when a donor at the roundtable discussion asked about Democrats trying to paint the Republican ticket as ""weird,"" Trump replied: ""Not about me. They're saying that about JD.""Trump didn't reveal any loss of confidence in Vance. Rather, he offered him simple advice: Attack, attack, attack. And Trump has been impressed over the past week as Vance attacked Harris and her new running mate, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, on the campaign trail -- praising him and taking credit for scouting him, according to two people who have spoken to Trump. They said Trump had described Vance as a great political ""athlete.""Trump deals more in projection than subtext, and his recent posts on Truth Social reveal how blindsided he feels about the upturned election.Despite his public insistence that he would rather face Harris than Biden, those close to him say that is untrue. He had been on a glide path to an all-but-certain victory. Now, he needs to work for it.But Trump has also been whipsawed by a seven-week roller-coaster-ride of events: an attempt on his life, the selection of a running mate, a nominating convention, his opponent's withdrawal from the race, the entry of a galvanizing new rival, a potential Iranian assassination threat against him and new layers of security that have brought a bunkerlike feel to his properties, more than at any time since he was in the White House.Also unsettling to him: For the first time in Trump's political life, his opponent has received more sustained news coverage than he has, beating him at the game of ""earned media,"" the kind that costs campaigns nothing to produce.Moreover, the coverage of Harris has overwhelmingly been positive.Harris ""has gotten the equivalent of the largest in-kind contribution of free media I think I have ever seen in all the years I've been doing presidential campaigns,"" said Tony Fabrizio, the Trump campaign's chief pollster.Trump has seemed to want to wish his new situation away. He claimed on Truth Social, without evidence, that Biden regretted his decision to drop out and wanted to undo it. He has talked repeatedly about how badly he thinks Democrats mistreated Biden. He has complained about how unfair it is that he's had to start the race over again. He has vented about wasting time, energy and millions of dollars on Biden, only to find himself facing a new opponent for the final 100-day sprint.And Trump told one aide that Democrats were trying to ""steal"" the election again from him -- comparing the reshuffling of the Democratic ticket to when state legislatures changed voting rules midway through the 2020 election cycle because of the COVID pandemic.He has also peppered his advisers with questions about whether Harris can sustain her momentum, constantly asking what new polling shows.Soon after Harris replaced Biden atop the Democratic ticket, Fabrizio, the Trump pollster, stressed to the campaign staff that the polls would get worse before they got better. Fabrizio has insisted, though, that the race has not fundamentally changed, that once voters are educated about Harris ' liberal record on crime and her role in Biden's unpopular policies -- especially on immigration -- they will sour on her.Fabrizio has predicted to campaign colleagues that Harris will have two to three more good weeks, through the Democratic National Convention, and then her poll numbers will turn in the other direction.Others are more concerned about what they are seeing in private polling. Two private polls conducted in Ohio recently by Republican pollsters -- which Trump carried in 2020 with 53% of the vote -- showed him receiving less than 50% of the vote against Harris in the state, according to a person with direct knowledge of the data.Nearly three weeks since Harris became his Democratic opponent, Trump and his campaign are still struggling to settle on how to define her, what message with which to attack her, and even what nickname with which to belittle her.He initially called her ""Laffin' Kamala,"" mocking her laugh, before cycling through other epithets, including ""Crooked,"" an insult he had used against both Hillary Clinton and Biden. Lately, he has favored ""Crazy Kamala.""His advisers have gone to great lengths testing policy-based attacks to see which work best with voters in the battleground states. They have privately described having so much material against Harris -- from interviews to policy statements to her record as a prosecutor -- that condensing it all into a specific frame can feel like a challenge.Yet most of Trump's top advisers have urged the campaign and the candidate to focus on the economy, immigration and crime -- issues on which Trump's message resonates powerfully with the so-called persuadable voters they are targeting.Sometimes, Trump has done so. Other times, he has not.His advisers have urged Trump to portray Harris as someone who frequently changes her positions, some of them recalling how successfully President George W. Bush used that strategy against John Kerry in the 2004 presidential race.Trump has called her ""fake"" -- but in self-defeating ways, like questioning whether Harris, who is Black, is Black.Outside advisers and allies have also called Trump to impress on him the political peril of continuing with those kinds of attacks. Kellyanne Conway, who managed his 2016 campaign, recently told Trump to stick to policy contrasts, rather than personal attacks, and to treat Harris as a formidable adversary, as he had Clinton.That advice has gone unheeded. At his news conference Thursday in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump again attacked Harris as ""nasty,"" denigrated her intellect and said she was ""very disrespectful"" to both her Black and Indian heritages.Trump's mood improved a little in recent days, people who have spoken with him said, after Harris named Walz her running mate. He had become convinced that she would choose Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, and that Shapiro could help her carry a must-win state. On ""Fox and Friends,"" Trump called Walz ""a shocking pick,"" adding, ""I could not be more thrilled.""Summertime has been a challenging season for Trump in election years: In June and again in August 2016, he replaced his campaign leadership. In July 2020, he fired his campaign manager.However, changes to his team do not now appear likely; Trump has privately expressed faith in his top advisers, even as he gripes about his current circumstances.On Aug. 2, before the Hamptons fundraiser, Trump met at his club in Bedminster, New Jersey, with his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, whom he had installed as a co-chair of the Republican National Committee, and with Conway, according to three people with knowledge of the meeting. Lara Trump, reached by phone, said there was no discussion of replacing any senior aides. Conway declined to detail her conversation with Donald Trump, but also said she had not discussed any personnel by name, saying she was there instead to discuss policy, strategy and how to beat his new, female rival.In an angry phone call to a New York Times reporter Friday afternoon, Trump denied that he was making any changes to his team, saying he was ""thrilled"" with his top advisers, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, and asking why he would even want to make such a change.(In the same call, Trump threatened to sue the Times over a story about his description in Thursday's news conference of a near-death experience on a helicopter ride with Willie Brown, a former California politician. Brown denied ever having flown on a helicopter with Trump.)Trump's own behavior remains one of the most unpredictable factors in his campaign.And after years of holding only a few rallies a month and still managing to play plenty of golf, while Biden held very few campaign events, Trump now has an opponent who is outworking him politically.Perhaps the clearest indication that Trump's knack for forcing the public discussion to take place on his terms was failing him came a week ago, when he abruptly declared in a midnight social media post that a debate on ABC News, to which he had agreed when Biden was running, was now ""terminated"" and that he would only debate Harris on the more hospitable terrain of Fox News.Trump was widely mocked as fearing a confrontation with Harris.On Thursday, he reversed himself, declaring in his news conference that he would, indeed, show up for the ABC debate -- and proposing two others.",Donald Trump's campaign has been in a tailspin since Joe Biden's withdrawal. Trump is struggling to find an effective argument against Kamala Harris. Trump's allies say he has been knocked off his bearings by the events of the past two weeks. Trump has picked fights with allies publicly and privately.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112449742,imgsize-72922,width-400,resizemode-4/112449742.jpg"
"JD Vance: JD Vance slams far-right white supremacist Nick Fuentes who attacked his wife, calls him a total...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jd-vance-slams-far-right-white-supremacist-nick-fuentest-who-attacked-his-wife-usha-calls-him-a-total-/articleshow/112448911.cms,"Who is Nick Fuentes?

Senator JD Vance , the Republican vice-presidential candidate from Ohio, has publicly disavowed far-right white supremacist Nick Fuentes, who recently attacked Vance's wife, Usha Vance , for her Indian heritage. Vance emphasised that the best way to respond to such attacks is to ""ignore"" them.Fuentes, who had dined with former President Trump at Mar-a-Lago in 2022, launched his attack on Vance and his family after Vance joined Trump’s re-election campaign last month.Fuentes questioned Vance's loyalty to white identity, citing his marriage to an Indian woman and the name of their child, Vivek.In response to these comments on CBS News’s “Face the Nation,” Vance stated that such views have “no place in the MAGA movement.” He added, “Donald Trump has also criticised this person. Look, I think the guy’s a total loser. I absolutely disavow him. But if you ask me what I care more about, it’s not personal attacks but rather government policies that discriminate based on race. That’s my real concern.” Vance also highlighted the importance of ignoring such attackers, believing that “not feeding the trolls” would cause them to eventually fade away.Although Vance did not immediately condemn Fuentes's remarks, he did address the white supremacist attacks against his wife in an interview with Megyn Kelly, expressing deep love for his wife and pride in her accomplishments. He acknowledged the challenges they face due to her heritage but emphasised their strong relationship.Trump’s 2022 meeting with Fuentes drew widespread criticism, including from within his own party. The meeting, which also included rapper Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, who later claimed to have angered Trump by asking him to be his running mate in 2024, added to the controversy.The Justice Department has labelled Fuentes a white supremacist, known for his racist and antisemitic rhetoric, while Ye has also faced backlash for antisemitic remarks.Nick Fuentes has emerged as a prominent figure on the far right in America, notorious for his antisemitic, racist, and white supremacist views. As the head of the America First Political Action Conference, he has formed connections with several Republican lawmakers, including Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Representative Paul Gosar of Arizona. His rise has been marked by statements and actions aligned with his extremist ideology.Fuentes openly promotes his hateful views on his podcast, recently calling for military intervention in Black neighbourhoods and demanding that Jews leave the country. He has gained notoriety for denying the Holocaust and using openly racist language, attracting condemnation from various political and social groups.A notable incident involving Fuentes occurred when he attended a dinner with former President Donald J. Trump at Trump’s private club in Florida. The dinner, also attended by Kanye West and political operative Karen Giorno, sparked controversy due to Fuentes’s extreme views. Trump later claimed he was unaware of Fuentes’s background, but the meeting highlighted the lack of discipline in Trump’s post-presidency activities.Fuentes first gained widespread attention for his involvement in the violent far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. He later led the America First movement, whose followers, known as groypers, have actively supported Trump, especially after the 2020 presidential election. Fuentes's rhetoric has often been incendiary, urging his followers to ""storm every state capitol"" and leading chants to ""Destroy the G.O.P.""On January 6, 2021, Fuentes was present at the Capitol, where he and his supporters rallied in favour of Trump. Following the attack, several individuals connected to his organization were charged with federal crimes. Fuentes himself was subpoenaed by the House select committee investigating the January 6 attack, seeking information about his involvement.Despite widespread condemnation, Fuentes remains a vocal and influential figure within the far-right community, reflecting the ongoing challenges posed by extremist ideologies in American politics.","Nick Fuentes is a prominent figure on the far right in America.

Joe Biden name-drops Democrats who pushed him out of presidential race in staged coup,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/joe-biden-name-drops-democrats-who-pushed-him-out-of-presidential-race-in-staged-coup/articleshow/112446778.cms,"Joe Biden , in his first interview after quitting the US presidential race , said that some Democrats pushed him out of the race with Speaker Nancy Pelosi being involved in the staged coup attempt.“A number of my Democratic colleagues in the House and Senate thought that I was going to hurt them in the races. And I was concerned if I stayed in the race, that would be the topic — you’d be interviewing me about why did Nancy Pelosi say [something] … and I thought it’d be a real distraction,” he said in CBS interview.“When I ran the first time, I thought of myself as being a transition president.I can’t even say how old I am — it’s hard for me to get out of my mouth,” he added.The statement aligns with journalist Seymour Hersh's report, which claimed that Barack Obama threatened Joe Biden with the 25th Amendment, asserting that he had ""Kamala's approval"" to remove him from the race, Collin Rugg said in a post on X.""Obama called Biden after breakfast [on July 20] and said, 'Here’s the deal. We have Kamala’s approval to invoke the 25th Amendment,'"" a senior Washington official told Hersh, according to Collin Rugg.Biden has been vocal about his support for Harris and had said, ""Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor Tim Walz are running a campaign on behalf of all Americans. And when they’re elected, they will govern on behalf of all Americans.""Expressing his doubts about peaceful transfer of power in case Trump loses, Biden said, ""If Trump loses, I'm not confident at all. He means what he says. We don't take him seriously. He means it, all the stuff about, 'If we lose, there'll be a bloodbath, it'll have to be a stolen election.'""""Look what they're trying to do now in the local election districts where people count the votes, or putting people in place in states that they're going to count the votes, right?,"" he added.","Biden said that some Democrats thought that he was going to hurt them in the races.

House explosion in Maryland kills one and damages surrounding neighborhood,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/house-explosion-in-maryland-kills-one-and-damages-surrounding-neighborhood/articleshow/112447969.cms,"BEL AIR : At least one person died and two were injured after a Maryland house exploded Sunday amid reports of a possible gas leak , fire officials said.Neighbors described feeling and hearing the early morning blast that damaged a number of surrounding houses in Bel Air, a town about about 30 miles (48 kilometers) northeast of Baltimore.Firefighters were called to the scene around 6:40 am for a report of a gas leak and an outdoor odor of gas, said Oliver Alkire, a master deputy with the State Fire Marshal's Office .Alkire said that as firefighters were approaching, they began receiving calls that the house had exploded. First responders pronounced a victim dead at the scene.Alkire said that a home next door to the explosion was heavily damaged, and a woman in that house was treated for her injuries on the scene. At least one utility worker on the scene was also injured. Two utility workers were in the area to work on a reported electrical issue, but authorities didn't immediately say if that was related to the explosion.Investigators are working to determine how many houses were damaged and how far the blast radius was. Firefighters were continuing to search the debris for other possible victims of the blast. Authorities said there's no ongoing threat to the public.The blast leveled the home. A photo posted by county officials showed a number of firefighters around the rubble of one home with another damaged home in the background. Charred pieces of wood were heaped on the property, and insulation and splintered wood spilled out into the street.Alkire said the house that blew up was for sale, but it wasn't clear if it was still occupied.More than 60 first responders came to the scene from multiple agencies. The state fire marshal, sheriff and federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms were assisting with the probe, as is standard procedure.Lisa Czawlytko, who lives in a nearby condominium, said the explosion woke her and her three children and knocked a pet bird to the ground.She said the roof structure on four condominium buildings buckled and sent aluminum siding from the roof down to the ground. She attended a news conference at a nearby library to ask officials if it was safe to be in the building.She said she felt the force of the explosion.""The whole building shook like a major earthquake,"" she said in an interview.It scared her daughter, 8-year-old Myca.""I thought a bomb dropped,"" she said.The blast woke up Greg Clifford from a heavy sleep inside his townhouse about a block away. He first thought that a tree had fallen on his deck, or that a lightning strike caused the loud noise.""It just shook the whole thing,"" Clifford said. ""It was crazy loud.""He also noted some damage to his home.""The window in my bedroom is pulled away from the framing of the house,"" Clifford said. ""I mean, I can look straight down to my deck. My basement door - the glass - it didn't shatter, but it blew in, and my frame's all cracked out.""","Firefighters were called to the scene around 6:40 am for a report of a gas leak and an outdoor odor of gas.

Polio is transmitted through contaminated water or food, or contact with an infected person. Treatment includes bed rest, pain relievers, rehabilitation and portable ventilators.Dr Hamid Jafari, WHO 's regional director of polio eradication was cited by Al-Jazeera as saying that the challenge exists in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. ""This is where there's a lot of militancy, insecurity and community hostility and frustration towards the government because of conflict and a lack of services,"" Jafari said.Over 50 districts across Pakistan are detecting the virus, he said.Compounding to the challenges is the fact, says the WHO official that not only is the polio programme being targeted but also security personnel that are guarding the teams ""because they become soft targets when they are in the community.""At least 102 polio field workers, officials and security personnel have been killed, including at least six in campaigns carried out this year, the Al Jazeera report cited.Meanwhile, the latest victim is an 11-month-old infant from Qila, in Balochistan who has succumbed to paralysis caused by the wild poliovirus.The child from Qila who displayed symptoms of paralysis on July 17, is among the five cases detected in the district. Other cases in Balochistan have been reported in Chaman, Quetta, Zhob, Dera Bugti, and Jhal Magsi as per a report in the Balochistan Post.In Balochistan, the situation is compounded by a recent history of inadequate vaccination coverage and persistent misconceptions about the vaccine. Despite numerous vaccination campaigns, efforts have struggled to keep pace with the actual number of infections, the publication stated.","On August 10, the 14th polio case of the year was reported from Qilla Saifullah district of Balochistan boosting the number of poliovirus cases in the country to 13 for the year 2024.
