CHENNAI: Rahul Gandhi has endorsed the demand for power sharing in Tamil Nadu, two Congress functionaries told TOI. They said Rahul, who was in Gudalur on Tuesday, raised the matter in a casual conversation with TNCC president K Selvaperunthagai in the presence of Nilgiris MP A Raja of DMK, who reportedly replied that CM and DMK supremo M K Stalin would decide on the matter. TOI could not confirm it with Raja.""Rahul wondered why DMK was not accepting the idea of power-sharing when (PM Narendra) Modi is okay with it at Centre and N Chandrababu Naidu has done it in Andhra Pradesh,"" said a Congress politician, who claimed to be privy to the conversation. He said Rahul referred to the ""unconditional"" support Congress had extended to M Karunanidhi in 2006 when DMK with 96 MLAs, didn't have the majority to form govt.Another source, an AICC member, said he ""was told"" about Rahul being upset about DMK's silence on Congress's demand for three cabinet berths (as TOI reported last week). ""Rahul is said to have directed Selvaperunthagai to convince DMK, and Raja, who was present, said his 'Thalaivar' (Stalin) would decide on power sharing,"" he said.Rahul, after an event at a Gudalur school on Tuesday, travelled to the helipad in a car with Raja, Selvaperunthagai and AICC member Girish Chodankar.","Rahul Gandhi has endorsed the demand for power sharing in Tamil Nadu, two Congress functionaries told TOI.

SRINAGAR: Former J&K chief minister and PDP Mehbooba Mufti on Wednesday denounced what she called “profiling of mosques” by police, saying it amounted to interference in religious affairs and was an attempt to humiliate Kashmiri Muslims. It’s Hindu temples that needed to be “profiled”, she said.“If religious places are to be profiled, then start with temples. Identify who the priest is, whether he is a Dalit or a Brahmin, and how much money is charged for temple entry. None of this happens in our mosques,” Mehbooba said.Displaying a four-page police form, she said information about lands and management of mosques was already with the administration, but police were now seeking photographs, Aadhaar numbers and other personal details of imams, mosque management members and worshippers. “This kind of intense profiling is meant to push Kashmiri Muslims away from their religion,” the PDP chief said. “How much more you humiliate Kashmiri Muslims?”She also criticised CM Omar Abdullah for not speaking out on the issue. “Even if the police are not under him, he still has a voice and tongue,” she said.Alleging that “mosques are being treated like crime scenes”, Mehbooba said: “Will you do this with temples, gurdwaras or churches? This is not happening anywhere else in the country.”Accusing the govt of targeting Muslim institutions, she warned that the mosque-profiling exercise could be extended across the country. “What does the govt have to do with whether someone is Shia, Sunni or Barelvi? Mosques are open to all, unlike many temples where Dalits and women are barred,” she said.",Former J&K chief minister and PDP Mehbooba Mufti denounced what she called ‘profiling of mosques’ by police.

LeT Commander's Jihad Call Mirrors Pak Army Rhetoric As Terror And State Lines Blur On Kashmir

JAMMU: Security forces on Wednesday intensified the ongoing anti-terror operation in Najote village in J&K’s Kathua district by extending the cordon to at least a dozen surrounding villages, officials said. Yet another such operation was launched in Rajbagh, also in Kathua, after a resident reported sighting two terror suspects.The cordon-and-search operation in Najote was launched Tuesday based on intelligence inputs about the presence of terrorists in the area, and intermittent firing took place between security personnel and ultras. The region lies near Kamadh Nallah in Kahog forest belt, where an encounter had erupted on Jan 7.Officials said no further contact was established with the terrorists in Najote after Tuesday’s brief fire exchange, and it was suspected that the ultras may have managed to escape the cordon by taking advantage of treacherous terrain and darkness.Later, locals reported a terror suspect taking food from a shepherd in the area around midnight before vanishing into the deep forest. “Following this, additional forces were rushed to the site to strengthen the cordon, which has now been expanded to over a dozen villages surrounding Najote to track and kill the terrorists,” an official said.J&K Police’s SOG initiated a fresh cordon-and-search operation in Rajbagh’s Jakhole Baira and adjoining villages Wednesday after a villager reported spotting two suspected terrorists near his cattle shed. However, the suspects could not be traced so far, officials said.On March 28, 2025, four policemen were killed in a fierce gun battle with terrorists in Safiyan-Jakhole village, while two Pakistani ultras were gunned down.","Security forces on Wednesday intensified the ongoing anti-terror operation in Najote village in J&K’s Kathua district by extending the cordon to at least a dozen surrounding villages.

Rahul Gandhi’s support for Vijay’s 'Jana Nayagan': Message to DMK or push for new coalition with TVK in Tamil Nadu?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rahul-gandhis-support-for-vijays-jana-nayagan-message-to-dmk-or-push-for-new-coalition-with-tvk-in-tamil-nadu/articleshow/126525319.cms,"Thalapathy Vijay’s Jana Nayagan Gets Morning Relief, Evening Setback — Next Hearing Jan 21

NEW DELHI: Rahul Gandhi ’s strong support for actor-politician Vijay after delay in censor certification for Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) chief's film 'Jana Nayagan' has set tongues wagging about a possible political realignment in poll-bound Tamil Nadu. 'Jana Nayagan', which is widely publicised as Vijay's final film before his full-fledged entry into politics, was slated for a Pongal release on January 9. However, the film ran into last-minute hurdles after the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) did not issue certification in time.Rallying behind Vijay, Rahul attacked the Centre and said the I&B ministry’s ""attempt to block"" 'Jana Nayagan' was an attack on Tamil culture. He also targeted the Prime Minister and said: ""Mr Modi, you will never succeed in suppressing the voice of the Tamil people.” The TVK has been quick to acknowledge Rahul’s support as a “friendly gesture.”While the Tamil Nadu Congress has denied any “political motive” behind Rahul’s gesture, the fact remains that this comes at a time when the grand-old-party’s ties with its old ally DMK has been tense over demands of power sharing.The DMK and the Congress have been partners in Tamil Nadu for long and have contested several elections together, but the grand-old party has not been a part of the DMK government in the state.The Congress wants that to change now. When Congress MP Manickam Tagore said the time has come to move beyond seat-sharing and initiate discussions on the sharing of power, he was echoing the sentiments of a section of the party.However, this “power sharing” proposal was nipped in the bud by the DMK. Ruling out any scope for coalition government, senior DMK leader and state minister I Periyasamy said: ""There had never been a coalition government. The state had all along been helmed by the DMK on its own. There is no doubt about this stand of the party, there will be no coalition government and the chief minister is firm on this stand.""So, what should the Congress do? Continue with this arrangement that has been in place for years or chart a different course with a new ally?The politics of Tamil Nadu has traditionally been bipolar between two arch political rivals - the DMK and the AIADMK. However, 2026 could be different. There’s a third regional player in the fray. The entry of actor-turned-politician Joseph Vijay Chandrasekhar, fondly known as Thalapathy Vijay, has made the upcoming electoral contest interesting. Vijay’s Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) has already made an impressive start giving jitters to the two established regional players.Vijay is confident that his TVK will script history in the elections - just as it had happened in the 1967 and 1977 assembly elections in the state. The DMK had won for the first time in 1967 while the AIADMK won elections a decade later.While the TVK has not opened its alliance cards, Vijay has made it clear several times that his party will not join hands with either the DMK or the BJP. The actor-politician had also said that if there were any alliance in the future, it would be led by the TVK and opposed to both the DMK and the BJP.It is in this context that Rahul Gandhi’s support for Vijay has raised interest. Already there have been speculations about a tie up after TVK’s national spokesperson Felix Gerald had called the Congress a “natural ally.” ""The Congress and TVK are natural allies in terms of secularism and their stand against communalism. In that sense, we have always been natural partners. Rahul Gandhi and our leader are also friends,"" Gerald had said.Adding fuel to this fire was senior Congress leader and head of the party's Data Analytics Unit, Praveen Chakravarty, who later met TVK leader Vijay.Which brings us to the question: Is the Congress seriously considering a third front in Tamil Nadu under the leadership of Vijay or is the grand-old party using Vijay's party to bargain “power sharing” deal and extra seats with the DMK?Perhaps, we may have some answers on Congress’s future course of action in the state after Rahul’s meeting with senior state leaders in Delhi on Jan 18 and 19.",Rahul Gandhi’s strong support for actor-politician Vijay after delay in censor certification for Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) chief's film 'Jana Nayagan' has set tongues wagging about a possible political realignment in poll-bound Tamil Nadu.

VARANASI/HYDERABAD/BIDAR: Razor-sharp Chinese manja - glass-coated kite string, banned but still widely used - sliced through necks and faces Wednesday, killing at least three people in UP, Telangana and Karnataka while injuring well over 100 across states as Makar Sankranti celebrations and routine travel collided with lethal strands dangling across roads and bridges.In UP, 28-year-old doctor Sameer Hashmi bled to death after Chinese manja cut his throat near a public school campus. Hashmi, a resident of Kerakat town, was riding his bike back from Jaunpur city when the string tightened around his neck. Rushed to the district hospital, he died during treatment.""Despite a continuing drive and seizures from kite shops and vendors, such cases are happening,"" said Jaunpur ASP Goldi Gupta, urging the public to inform authorities about illegal sellers and users.Jaunpur has now recorded two such deaths within a month.

Police said Chinese manja stretched across a village road sliced his neck as he rode a motorcycle to a market. He was declared dead on arrival at a govt hospital. Kumar's 19-year-old son, who had travelled with him, filed a police complaint.In northern Karnataka, Chinese manja cut short a father's festival journey.Sanjiva Kumar, 48, a gram panchayat worker from Bambulagi village, died Wednesday on a flyover near Talamadagi in Bidar district. He had set out on his motorbike to bring home his 16-year-old daughter from a residential school for Sankranti. Thrown from the bike after the string sliced his neck, he managed to call his daughter, saying he might be delayed - his final call. He was declared dead at Chitaguppa taluk hospital.Varanasi saw a close call. Jitendra Maurya suffered deep cuts to his eyelids and nose when manja struck him on Samneghat bridge while he was riding a motorcycle.Telangana police said at least 10 injuries linked to the string have been reported in recent weeks, including a police officer who required 10 stitches to his neck and a four-year-old boy who needed 12 stitches after a deep gash.More than 100 people in Jaipur, many of them bikers, were treated for facial and neck cuts caused by snapped strings. A seven-month-old baby suffered a throat cut.

Emphasising strategic competition in the Arctic, Trump added, “If we don't go in, Russia and China are going to go in.

GURGAON: After an alleged white-collar terror module involving doctors at Al-Falah University in Faridabad with purported links to the Delhi blast was busted last year, police have directed the varsity to conduct police verification of all new students and staff.Investigations into the Nov 10 blast, which killed 15 people, led agencies to Al-Falah University. Dr Mohd Umar Nabi, identified as the suicide bomber, and two other alleged conspirators—Dr Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie and Dr Shahin Shaheed—were working there as doctors and teaching MBBS course.DCP Faridabad (NIT) Maqsood Ahmed has instructed officers to collect details of all new students seeking admission for the upcoming academic session. A special verification drive has also been ordered on the campus.""We will conduct a special verification drive in the university to check details of all new students. I have directed the SHO of the station concerned to start the verification process. We need details of all new students, especially those from outside Faridabad or from other states, including Jammu and Kashmir. Even new staff will be appointed only after police verification,"" DCP Ahmed told TOI.Sources said several staff members left the university after national and state investigating agencies intensified action on the campus. Many students also returned home. Parents of several students met university authorities, seeking assurances about the safety of their children's degrees and careers after the arrests of doctors and the prolonged questioning of students and staff.The investigation gained pace after Dr Muzammil Ganaie (35) was arrested by a J&K Police team on Oct 30. He managed the emergency wing of the university hospital and had been associated with Al-Falah for more than three years.After his arrest, police said they recovered nearly 2,900kg explosive and flammable materials, a Krinkov assault rifle with three magazines, 83 live cartridges, a pistol with eight live rounds, two empty cartridges, two additional magazines, 12 suitcases, a bucket filled with explosive material, 20 timers, four batteries, remote controls, and a walkie-talkie set from two rooms he had recently rented.Although Dr Muzammil stayed on the Al-Falah campus, the explosives were recovered from two nearby locations—Dauj village and Dehar Colony in Fatehpur Taga.The probe widened after investigators found that Dr Muzammil was using a Swift Dzire registered in the name of Dr Shahin Shaheed. Dr Shahin, a doctor from Lucknow and described by investigators as Dr Muzammil's girlfriend, was also teaching MBBS students at Al-Falah. She was taken into custody by J&K Police in Lucknow after an assault rifle was recovered from her car in Faridabad, which police said had been placed there by Dr Muzammil.The third accused, Mohd Umar Nabi, was allegedly seen driving the i20 that exploded near Red Fort on the evening of Nov 10. He, too, had been teaching MBBS students at Al-Falah University for the past three years.Al-Falah University has around 250 faculty members across MBBS, pharmacy, and paramedical courses, and is among the major private medical education institutions in the region.",Alleged white-collar terror module involving doctors at Al-Falah University in Faridabad busted.

HYDERABAD: Telangana police are investigating the mass killing by lethal injection of at least 500 stray dogs in three districts of the state — Kamareddy, Hanamakonda and Jagtial — over past 10 days.Police say the barbarous killings were carried out by “professional dog killers”, allegedly at the behest of some newly elected sarpanches trying to fulfil promises to voters before gram panchayat elections in Dec last year.Police in the three districts, acting on complaints by animal rights activists, have registered cases against 17 people — at least seven of them sarpanches.Sources alleged that the sarpanches had assured the electorate that they would eliminate stray dogs and put an end to the monkey menace in villages once elected.According to police from Machareddy village, more than 200 dogs were allegedly killed in villages in Kamareddy district over past week. Police have named eight persons, including seven sarpanches — one each from Bhavanipet, Palwancha, Faridpet, Wadi and Bandarameshwarapally villages, and two from Hanamakonda district — and Kishore Pandey, a professional dog killer allegedly hired from Andhra Pradesh.The FIR was registered on Jan 12 based on a complaint by Adulapuram Goutham, animal cruelty prevention manager of Stray Animal Foundation of India.In his complaint, he also alleged he found dog carcasses dumped near Peddacheruvu, in Bhavanipet village, and later confirmed similar incidents in Palwancha and Faridpet.“We suspect that the sarpanches of Bhavanipet, Palwancha and Faridpet were involved in the killing of 244 dogs. Post-mortem examinations of the buried carcasses have been conducted and samples sent to laboratories for forensic analysis. A detailed investigation is underway,” a senior Machareddy police officer said.“About 150 dogs were killed in our village by administering injections about 15 days ago,” a villager from Nalgonda said on condition of anonymity. He added the newly elected sarpanch ordered killings as there had been many dog-bite cases in village, apart from injuries caused by dogs chasing people on bikes.In Hanamakonda district, police booked nine people for alleged killing of around 300 dogs between Jan 6 and Jan 8, while about 30 dogs were killed in Jagtial last month.",Telangana police investigating mass killing by lethal injection of at least 500 stray dogs.

GURGAON: A 42-year-old woman was allegedly gangraped at a deserted roadside dhaba in Bahadurgarh early on Monday by a group of men who had followed the bus she was travelling in. Four of the five accused were arrested, while one remains at large.Jhajjar police commissioner Rajshree Singh said the woman, a resident of UP, had come to Delhi's neighbouring town with her uncle to look for a job. In her statement to the police, the woman said they alighted from the bus at Pandit Shree Ram Sharma metro station of Delhi Metro's Green Line around 2am on Jan 12. Her cousin had come to pick them up. That is when they noticed the five men following them.""By around 2.30 am, the men separated the woman from her uncle and cousin, intimidated them and took her to a deserted dhaba on Delhi-Rohtak Road, where they sexually assaulted her,"" a senior police officer said. The dhaba is around 100 metres from the metro station.After the family approached police, multiple teams were formed to trace the suspects. The woman's statement was recorded and an FIR was registered at City police station in Bahadurgarh. Her medical examination was conducted and her statement was recorded before a magistrate.Police said the woman initially told officers that the accused had stolen some belongings and insisted that nothing else had happened.However, investigators later recovered the digital video recorder (DVR) of a CCTV camera from the dhaba, which captured the sexual assault. ""She agreed to give a detailed statement, and her uncle subsequently filed a complaint,"" the commissioner said.According to investigators, shortly before the assault, the accused purchased liquor from a nearby shop, paying Rs 100 in cash while transferring the remaining Rs 30 digitally through UPI. The transaction proved to be a critical lead. ""Tracing the Paytm account allowed us to identify the suspects and reconstruct the sequence of events,"" a police officer involved in the probe said.Local Crime Investigation Agency (CIA) teams also analysed CCTV footage from the dhaba and surrounding areas to track the suspects' movements. Digital payment records, call detail records, social media analysis and inputs from local intelligence were used to narrow down the accused.Within eight hours of the crime, four men, all residents of Bahadurgarh who are originally from Bihar and were living in rented accommodation in the Chhotu Ramnagar area, were arrested. Police, however, did not share their names, with a test identification parade pending. The arrested men were produced before a Bahadurgarh court on Wednesday and remanded in police custody for two days. ""Efforts are on to identify and apprehend the fifth accused,"" an officer said.Commissioner Singh praised the police teams for the swift arrests and said the department was committed to ensuring women's safety. ""Strict action will be taken against those involved in crimes against women, and no offender will be spared,"" she said.","A 42-year-old woman was allegedly gangraped at a deserted roadside dhaba in Bahadurgarh.

‘Fundamental disagreement’: Denmark discusses Greenland with US in White House meeting; urges ‘respectful’ cooperation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fundamental-disagreement-denmark-holds-talks-with-white-house-officials-over-greenland-trump-pushes-us-control-of-island/articleshow/126533573.cms,"Denmark's Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen and Greenland's Foreign Minister Vivian Motzfeldt speak at a news conference at the Embassy of Denmark (AP photo)





Officials from Greenland and Denmark met in Washington on Wednesday with senior White House officials, including Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, amid renewed remarks by US President Donald Trump arguing that Nato should help the United States acquire Greenland and insisting that anything short of American control of the world’s largest island is unacceptable.Following the talks, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said a “fundamental disagreement” over Greenland remains between Copenhagen and the White House after discussions with Vance and Rubio.Speaking at a press conference, Rasmussen said it was “absolutely not necessary” for the US to seize Greenland, adding that Trump has a clear wish of “conquering” the territory.Despite the differences, Rasmussen said the two sides agreed to establish a working group to explore ways to manage disagreements, even as Trump continues to press for a US takeover of Denmark’s semiautonomous Arctic territory.“The group, in our view, should focus on how to address the American security concerns, while at the same time respecting the red lines of the Kingdom of Denmark,” Rasmussen told reporters, in a conference alongside Greenland’s foreign minister Vivian Motzfeldt.Trump has repeatedly argued that Nato should play a role in helping the United States acquire Greenland, describing US control of the island as vital to national security and warning that anything less would be unacceptable.As the talks were under way, Denmark announced plans to strengthen its military presence in the Arctic and North Atlantic, even as Trump continued to justify his call for a US takeover of the vast territory by repeatedly claiming that China and Russia have designs on Greenland.Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio met for about an hour with Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen and Greenlandic Foreign Minister Vivian Motzfeldt to discuss Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark.Hours before the meeting, Trump reiterated on his social media platform that the US “needs Greenland for the purpose of National Security.” He added that “NATO should be leading the way for us to get it” and warned that otherwise Russia or China would — “AND THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN!”“NATO becomes far more formidable and effective with Greenland in the hands of the UNITED STATES,” Trump wrote. “Anything less than that is unacceptable.”In response, Greenland’s representatives to the US and Canada posted on social media, “Why don’t you ask us?” and pointed to polling showing a low percentage of island residents support becoming part of the US.Meanwhile, in Copenhagen, Danish Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen announced an increase in Denmark’s “military presence and exercise activity” in the Arctic and North Atlantic, “in close cooperation with our allies.”Poulsen said the enhanced presence was necessary in a security environment in which “no one can predict what will happen tomorrow.”“This means that from today and in the coming time there will be an increased military presence in and around Greenland of aircraft, ships and soldiers, including from other NATO allies,” he said.Other Nato allies were already arriving in Greenland alongside Danish forces, Poulsen added, declining to name the countries involved and saying it was up to each ally to announce its own participation.Earlier, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson wrote on X that “some officers from the Swedish Armed Forces are arriving in Greenland today” as part of a multinational group. “Together, they will prepare events within the framework of the Danish exercise Operation Arctic Endurance,” he said.Norway is also sending two military personnel to Greenland to explore further cooperation with allies, Defence Minister Tore O. Sandvik told newspaper VG.","Officials from Greenland and Denmark met in Washington on Wednesday with senior White House officials, including Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

A calculated predator







BENGALURU: She is a killer. She is a predator who hunted in silence. She is no ordinary Mallika — she is 'Cyanide Mallika', Bengaluru’s most chilling murderer and believe to be India's first woman serial killer.Her crimes, carried out with cold precision, echo the unnerving terror of Hollywood thrillers: like Aileen Wuornos in Monster, KD Kempamma killed in plain sight, preying on those who trusted her, masking horror beneath a calm exterior.She was cunning, patient and manipulative — her greatest weapon not cyanide alone, but the trust she gained by appearing devout and sympatheticMore than twenty decades ago, Bengaluru police announced the arrest of K D Kempamma alias Mallika, a woman who, investigators said, had single-handedly murdered multiple women by poisoning them with cyanide and fleeing with their jewellery.The disclosure sent ripples across the city, not just because of the brutality of the crimes, but because of where they unfolded.Police said Kempamma, then 43, targeted women in distress, gained their trust by posing as a devout believer, and executed her murders with chilling precision.By the time she was finally caught on December 31, 2007, Kempamma had confessed to killing at least six women since 1999.In the last three months alone, police said, she had murdered five women — all in Bengaluru — leaving behind a trail of unexplained deaths that had earlier been dismissed as mysterious or unnatural.According to investigators, Kempamma followed a consistent and calculated pattern. She frequented temples around Bengaluru, posing as an ardent devotee well-versed in religious rituals.Keeping a close watch on women who appeared troubled, she would strike up conversations, listen patiently to their personal problems and present herself as a sympathetic confidante.Once she gained their trust, Kempamma would suggest special rituals — mandal pooja or other forms of worship — claiming they could resolve issues such as childlessness, financial troubles or family discord.She would insist that the rituals be performed at temples on the outskirts of the city, far from the victim’s home, ensuring isolation.At these secluded locations, police said, Kempamma would administer cyanide — sometimes mixed in water she passed off as holy water, at other times in food.In some cases, she forcefully held the victim’s nose and made them drink the poisoned liquid.In others, she waited until they were asleep or praying. Death was swift. Once the victim collapsed, Kempamma would calmly remove jewellery and valuables and disappear.The serial killings came to light after Kempamma was arrested by Kalasipalyam police on a tip-off that a woman was attempting to sell jewellery and mobile phones in a suspicious manner at a bus stand.When questioned, she identified herself as Mallika and soon revealed details that stunned investigators.“She had single-handedly murdered six women by using cyanide and decamped with their jewellery and valuables,” then city police commissioner N Achuta Rao said. The victims, police said, were chosen carefully — mostly well-off women who frequented temples and were vulnerable due to personal distress.During interrogation, Kempamma admitted to the crimes, leading police to reopen several cases that had earlier been registered as mysterious deaths. One of the murders, police confirmed, had taken place in Tamil Nadu , while others were in and around Bengaluru.Of the murders Kempamma confessed to, police said three had been registered as mysterious deaths and two as unnatural deaths.In several cases, the women had died inside temple premises, with no visible signs of violence, making it difficult for investigators at the time to suspect foul play.West DCP K V Sharat Chandra said police began re-examining deaths reported in temples over the previous years and sought inputs from medical experts to identify cases involving cyanide poisoning.The reopening of old cases revealed disturbing similarities — women found dead during prayers, missing jewellery and no immediate suspects.Kempamma’s confession tied these loose ends together.Police said Kempamma was a resident of Kaggalipura and had been running a chit fund business.She was married to Devaraj, a tailor working at NIMHANS. Her life, however, took a drastic turn in 1998 when she incurred heavy business losses and was abandoned by her husband.She was reportedly thrown out of her house and left to fend for herself. Investigators believe it was after this period that she chose what police described as a “murderous path”.Her first confirmed murder took place on October 19, 1999, in Hoskote, when she killed a 30-year-old woman, Mamatha Rajan, while the victim was praying.Police said Kempamma’s killing spree intensified dramatically in 2007. Between October and December that year, she murdered five women, all in Bengaluru. Her final known victim was a 30-year-old woman who, police said, was distressed over not having a male child. Kempamma killed her while she was asleep.Each murder followed a familiar pattern — befriending the victim at a temple, suggesting a special pooja, isolating them at a distant location and administering cyanide. The jewellery she stole was later sold or pledged, eventually leading to her arrest.In a chilling revelation, police said Kempamma had been arrested once before, in 2001, by Bidadi police. She was caught while attempting to rob jewellery from a house where she was performing a ritual. At the time, she was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment and released after completing her term.That arrest, police admitted, did not trigger a deeper investigation into her activities. It would take another six years — and multiple deaths — for her crimes to be fully uncovered.Following her arrest in 2007, Kempamma faced multiple trials across different courts. A Fast Track Court awarded her the death sentence for murdering five elderly women for gain. In 2010, a Tumkur court sentenced her to death for the murder of Muniyamma at the Yediyur Siddalingeshwara temple in Kunigal taluk.In 2012, the Bangalore rural 1st additional sessions court again imposed the death penalty on Kempamma for the murder of K Nagalakshmi at Ghati Subramanya, where she had used cyanide and electric wire before committing robbery.Another sessions court awarded her the death sentence for the murder of Nagaveni, a housewife found dead in a temple in Doddaballapur. Nagaveni, police said, was childless and had been persuaded by Kempamma to perform special pujas while wearing all her jewellery.The Karnataka High Court later intervened in some of these cases. In one instance, it remanded the case back to the sessions court, directing it to record the cross-examination of the doctor who conducted the post-mortem and complete the trial within a stipulated time.In other cases, trial courts awarded Kempamma life imprisonment. In one such case relating to the murder of 50-year-old Pillamma in Maddur taluk, the additional sessions court sentenced her to life imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs 5,000.Kempamma was lodged in Parappana Agrahara central prison. She later made headlines when reports emerged that she was housed in a cell adjacent to that of AIADMK leader VK Sasikala Following security concerns, jail authorities shifted Kempamma to Hindalga prison in Belagavi, one of the oldest prisons in the country, which houses several death row convicts and terror accused.Jail sources said the move was carried out quietly, without prior intimation to the inmate.Investigators said Kempamma’s greatest weapon was not cyanide, but trust. By exploiting faith and vulnerability, she turned temples into hunting grounds and rituals into instruments of death.Her victims trusted her as a fellow devotee, unaware that the holy water she offered would be their last.As police pieced together her crimes, the pattern became unmistakable — a serial killer who hid in plain sight, using religion as a shield and distress as a doorway.The case, officers said, served as a grim reminder that evil sometimes wears the most convincing disguise.","Kempamma alias Mallika, who trapped women in distress and killed them with cyanide, was arrested by the city police in Bangalore on December 31, 2007.

Trump Gets Death Threat At Tehran Mass Funeral Amid Iran Unrest; ‘Won’t Miss Next Shot’





US President Donald Trump on Wednesday described Iranian opposition figure Reza Pahlavi as a “very nice” person but expressed doubts over whether the exiled former crown prince could rally enough support inside Tehran to take over. His remarks came as protests against the clerical regime continued to grip the country.Speaking in an exclusive interview with Reuters at the Oval Office, Trump said there was a possibility that Iran’s clerical government could collapse under the pressure of unrest, but he did not openly support Pahlavi as an alternative leader.Trump has repeatedly warned that the United States could intervene in support of Iranian protesters, yet signalled caution about endorsing any single opposition figure.“He seems very nice, but I don’t know how he’d play within his own country. And we really aren’t up to that point yet,” Trump said.Reza Pahlavi is the son of Iran’s last shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was overthrown in the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The 65-year-old has lived in exile for decades and has emerged as a prominent voice amid the current wave of demonstrations against Iran’s ruling establishment.Trump added that while he would not oppose Pahlavi if Iranians accepted his leadership, it was unclear whether that support existed.“I don’t know whether or not his country would accept his leadership, and certainly if they would, that would be fine with me,” he said.The US president’s remarks came as Iran faces widespread protests that began over economic hardship and have since grown into broader calls for political change and an end to the theocratic system.Demonstrations have spread across multiple cities despite heavy security measures, internet restrictions and mass arrests. Thousands of people have reportedly been killed in a crackdown on the unrest.Trump said it was possible that the government in Tehran could fall, though he cautioned that political outcomes are unpredictable. “Whether or not it falls or not, it’s going to be an interesting period of time,” he said, adding that “any regime can fail.”Pahlavi has used the moment to urge sustained protests, arguing that continued pressure could lead to the collapse of the current leadership. In a recent video message and social media post, Pahlavi said that he is preparing to return home after remaining in exile for almost five decades“I, too, am preparing to return to the homeland so that at the time of our national revolution’s victory, I can be beside you, the great nation of Iran. I believe that day is very near,” he wrote.He has also claimed that the opposition has a plan for a post-regime transition, including what he describes as a “100-day plan” to establish a democratic government and prevent chaos. “Do not abandon the streets. My heart is with you… We will take back Iran,” he said in a message, as reported by ANI.Born in Tehran in 1960, Reza Pahlavi was named crown prince in 1967. He left Iran in 1978, shortly before the revolution, to undergo jet fighter training in the United States and later studied political science at the University of Southern California. After his father’s death in 1980, he declared himself shah in exile, later telling The Washington Post in 1989, “In a way, I’m king-elect.”Despite his lineage, Pahlavi has said he does not seek a restoration of the monarchy. He has positioned himself as an advocate for a secular, democratic system achieved through non-violent civil disobedience and a national referendum, describing his role as that of a “catalyst” for change.","US President Donald Trump described Iranian opposition figure Reza Pahlavi as a “very nice” person.

Brandon Tatum explains why he is protecting Nick Shirley after death threats





Brandon Tatum says he stepped in to protect Nick Shirley after the YouTuber said he started getting death threats. Tatum explained his reason in simple words: “Exposing fraud shouldn’t come with death threats. ” The issue began after Nick Shirley shared a long video about an alleged fraud case linked to daycare centers in Minnesota. After the video went live in late December 2025, Shirley said the reaction turned scary. He claimed people began sending threats, and he feared for his safety and his family.Shirley later revealed that he could not afford full-time security on his own. That is when Brandon Tatum, also known online as Officer Tatum, stepped in. Tatum said free speech should not put anyone’s life at risk. He also shared a donation link to help cover security costs. Nick Shirley spoke about these threats on podcasts and social media, saying the pressure has been heavy and constant.Nick Shirley spoke openly about the threats during his appearance on the Modern Wisdom podcast with host Chris Williamson, released on January 10, 2026. He said he now has security with him all day and at his home.Shirley explained,“Right now, I have somebody with me 24/7. I have somebody at the house as well. Super expensive, and as a YouTuber, I do not make enough money to afford it.”He added that Brandon Tatum helped through a nonprofit security effort, saying people could donate to support safety needs.On January 13, 2026, Brandon Tatum reposted a clip and wrote,“I stepped in to help protect Nick Shirley because exposing fraud shouldn’t come with death threats. When truth-tellers are forced to pay for 24/7 security just to stay alive, that is a problem.”This was not the first time Shirley spoke about the threats. On a podcast with Patrick Bet-David, he said people warned he could be “kirked,” a reference to the killing of Charlie Kirk, who was shot at Utah Valley University in September 2025, according to police reports.Shirley said his family was also affected.“I feel bad for my family, honestly. My little sister is getting phone calls, and we did nothing wrong.”Tatum later repeated on The Officer Tatum Show that people should be able to speak without fear, saying telling the truth should never be a death sentence.In related political news, Tim Walz announced on January 5, 2026, that he would not seek re-election, according to state reports. Shirley reacted online, claiming his reporting played a role.Also Read: YouTuber LabCoatz Claims He Cracked Coca Cola Recipe After Year Long Science Testing Surprises Fans Worldwide",Brandon Tatum says he stepped in to protect Nick Shirley after the YouTuber said he started getting death threats.

Iran on Thursday closed its airspace amid threats from US President Donald Trump over its crackdown on the protests which have rocked the Islamic Republic since the last two weeks.According to Human Rights Activists news agency, more than 2500 people have been killed in the demonstrations. The death toll included over 100 security personnel and thirteen childrenAdditionally, more than 18,400 people have been detained.Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi rejected the claims of mass causalities and accused Israel of hatching a conspiracy to create a large number of causalities in the country.In an interview with the Fox News, Araghchi played down the death toll in his country and claimed that the number is in hundreds.""When terrorist elements led from outside, entered this, you know, protests and started to shoot, you know, police forces, police officers and security forces. And there were terrorist cells. They came in, they used Daesh-style terrorist operations. They got police officers, burned them alive, they beheaded them, and they started shooting at police officers and also to the people,"" Iranian foreign minister said.""So as a result, for three days, we had, in fact, fighting against terrorists, and not with the protesters.

And we don't go for a high level of tension, which could be disastrous for everybody,"" he added.Responding to a question from Fox News host Bret Baier on whether he had a message for President Trump, who is considering some kind of action to help the protesters on the ground, the Araghchi said ""My message is do not repeat the same mistake that you did in June,"" the Iranian Foreign Minister said.""You know, if you try a failed experience, you will get the same result,"" he added.""You know in June, you destroyed the facilities, the machines, but the technology cannot be bombed. And the determination also cannot be bombed,"" Abbas Araghchi added.Araghchi said that the ""terrorists"" are shooting people just to drag US into the conflict.""They wanted to increase the number of deaths. Why? Because President Trump has said that if there are killings, he would intervene. And they wanted to drag him into this conflict,"" the Iranian foreign minister told Fox News.""And that was exactly an Israeli plot. They started to increase the number of deaths by killing ordinary people, by killing police officers, by starting a kind of, you know, fighting inside the different cities,"" he added.Amid the ongoing chain of events, Iran further extended its airspace to commercial aircraft. A notice to pilot said the closure was estimated to last until 7:30 am local time. A previous order had closed the airspace for just over two hours.However, the government offered no explanation of the decision to shut its airspace.Meanwhile, Air India and IndiGO also issued a travel advisory warning of possible delays as they said that their flights are using an alternative routing after the closure of Iran airspace.""Due to the emerging situation in Iran, the subsequent closure of its airspace, and in view of the safety of our passengers, Air India flights overflying the region are now using an alternative routing, which may lead to delays,” it said in a post on X.“Air India regrets the inconvenience caused to passengers due to this unforeseen disruption. Safety of our passengers and crew remains top priority,” it added.Meanwhile, Air India cancelled Thursday morning’s Delhi-New York JFK (AI 101), Delhi-Newark (AI 105) and Mumbai-JFK (AI 119). The return flights were consequentially also cancelled.IndiGo’s Baku-Delhi flight early Thursday morning also returned to the Azerbaijan capital within an hour as it was to overfly Iran after crossing the Caspian Sea.Earlier on Wednesday, some US military personnel were advised to evacuate military base in Qatar as Trump warned of possible action after a deadly crackdown on protesters in Iran.The decision came as a senior official in Tehran brought up the country's retaliatory attack in June at Al Udeid Air Base outside Doha, Qatar.An official, on the condition of anonymity, told news agency Associated Press that the move was precautionary and said such measures also were being taken across the region. The official, citing the need for operational security, would not go into further detail, including whether the evacuation was optional or mandatory, whether it affected troops or civilian personnel, or how many people were advised to leave.The US Embassy in Qatar issued a notice early Thursday saying it had “advised its personnel to exercise increased caution and limit non-essential travel” to Al Udeid Air Base. “We recommend US citizens in Qatar do the same,” it added. In Kuwait, the US embassy ordered a “temporary halt” to its personnel going to multiple military bases in the small Gulf Arab country amid heightened tensions. Kuwait is home to U.S. Army Central, the service’s Mideast command.Talking to news agency Reuters, Trump said that Iranian opposition figure Reza Pahlavi ""seems very nice"" but expressed uncertainty over whether Pahlavi would be able to muster support within Iran to eventually take over.""He seems very nice, but I don't know how he'd play within his own country,"" Trump said. ""And we really ‌aren't up to that point yet.Trump's comments went further in questioning Pahlavi's ability to lead Iran after saying last week that he had no plans to meet with him.Trump added that it is possible the government in Tehran could fall due to the protests but that in truth ""any regime can fail.""""Whether or not it falls or not, it's going to be an interesting period of time,"" he said.The demonstrations began December 28 over the collapse of the Iranian rial currency, as the country’s economy is squeezed by international sanctions levied in part over its nuclear program.Trump has repeatedly warned about potential US military action over the killing of peaceful protesters, just months after American forces bombed Iranian nuclear sites during a 12-day war launched by Israel against the Islamic Republic in June.In other developments, a mass funeral was held on Wednesday for some 100 security force members killed in the demonstrations. Tens of thousands of mourners attended, holding Iranian flags and photos of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The caskets, draped in Iranian flags, stood stacked at least three high. Red and white roses and framed photographs of the dead covered them.People elsewhere remained fearful in the streets. Plainclothes security forces still milled around some neighborhoods, though anti-riot police and members of the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard's all-volunteer Basij force appeared to have been sent back to their barracks.“We are very frightened because of these sounds (of gunfire) and protests,” said a mother of two shopping for fruits and vegetables, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. “We have heard many are killed and many are injured. Now peace has been restored, but schools are closed, and I’m scared to send my children to school again.”Ahmadreza Tavakoli, 36, told The Associated Press he witnessed one demonstration in Tehran and was shocked by the use of firearms by authorities.“People were out to express themselves and protest, but quickly it turned into a war zone,” Tavakoli said. “The people do not have guns. Only the security forces have guns.”","Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi accused Israel of hatching a conspiracy to create a large number of causalities in the country. He also said that the Iranian government is not planning to hang the detained protestors, claiming that the situation is under government's control.

The Trump administration’s announcement of an indefinite pause on immigrant visa processing for 75 countries has sparked outrage among parts of the MAGA base, who are frustrated that India was not included. The suspension is effective January 21, 2026 and is aimed at “bringing an end to the abuse” of the system by those who might exploit public benefits, according to the US State Department.The GOP government has already halted immigrant visa processing for nationals from countries including Brazil, Iran, Russia, Somalia and several African nations.Despite the broader restrictions, Indian nationals remain unaffected, which the MAGA supporters were not happy with. “Why is India not on that list,” wrote one Reddit user.Another commented: “The billionaires need them for the H‑1B visas.” Other reactions included: “What country should be next? India.""“Is this really the priority for America to become great again? and India is happy right now,"" said another.These comments came as the Republican party is pushing to invite the best and brightest, high-skilled immigrants, particularly the H‑1B visa programme to fill in crucial sectors like tech and defence.These proffesions are already dominated by Indians and Chinese.H‑1B visas have long been a source of tension for the conservative right. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has called the programme as a “total scam,” claiming it allows companies to replace American workers with cheaper foreign labour, mainly pointing to Indian workers.Conservative slain activist Charlie Kirk had also criticised the programme, arguing that the United States should stop issuing “more visas for people from India,” suggesting the country is “full.” Far-right commentator Laura Loomer has called for dismantling parts of the H‑1B system altogether. Indian-origin Nikki Haley's son Nalin Haley has also been a 'America First' loudmouth calling for an end to all legal and illegal immigration.At the same time, the MAGA stance is not uniform. Trump himself has publicly acknowledged the need for H‑1B visas to fill specialised positions lacking American talent. Tech leaders like Elon Musk have defended the programme as essential for bridging skill gaps.Meanwhile, the administration has tightened immigration processes overall, revoking over 100,000 visas since 2025 and introducing a $100,000 fee for H‑1B applications, measures that unfairly affect Indian nationals.","The US State Department announced an indefinite pause on immigrant visa processing for 75 countries.

Minneapolis is still reeling from the fatal ICE shooting of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good on January 7, 2026. As protests against the shocking incident go on and the administration tries to justify the act, another ICE video from the city is now making the rounds on the internet.In a video going viral online, ICE agents smashed the window of a car and yanked a woman out of it for allegedly obstructing an immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota.The footage captured the incident that broke out when the unidentified driver positioned her car across lanes of traffic, apparently blocking ICE vehicles from driving through during an ongoing anti-ICE protest.As agents tried to clear the streets of screaming protestors, some of them walked up to the female driver, appearing to ask her to move along. While the woman was talking to some agents on her side, others smashed her car's passenger window.“Go, go, go, go,” people yelled at the driver. However, at the same time, one Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) agent leaned into the black sedan and unlocked the driver's door as another one grabbed the woman.""I'm disabled, I'm trying to go to the doctor up there, that’s why I couldn’t move. I am an autistic disabled person, I’m trying to go to the doctor,"" the woman was heard shouting as the agents threw her to the ground.As the agents dragged her away, standing protestors blew whistles in protest and yelled at them to stop. “Where is your humanity?” asked one while another said, ""All you do is hurt.""Following the distressing protest scene and viral video, ICE official Marcos Charles issued a warning to the people who ""interfere"" with the agency's aggressive actions, in a conversation with FOX News.""We will be arresting anybody that interferes or impedes in any of these enforcement actions,"" he warned. The official also boasted about the number of people who have already been detained. ""We've already arrested 60… that have got in our way, impeded us or assaulted an officer.""A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security told The Independent that ICE officers had been in the area to arrest a 20-year-old man, originally from Ecuador, who they said entered the US illegally near El Paso, Texas in 2019.“One agitator ignored multiple commands by an officer to move her vehicle away from the scene, and she was arrested for obstruction.

A Senate hearing on the safety and regulation of abortion pills turned tense on Wednesday when Senator Josh Hawley repeatedly pressed Indian-origin obstetrician-gynecologist Dr. Nisha Verma on whether men can become pregnant.The exchange during the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee session went viral on social media.The hearing was meant to focus on the safety of medication abortion using mifepristone, the first pill in a two-drug regimen, and concerns over coerced or unsafe use.

The shocking ICE murder of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis has taken America by storm. From the administration saving face by blaming the victim to the civilians protesting against the agency, the incident exposed to many the dark reality of ICE operations and their fatal consequences.Good was a poet and mother and most of her family members who have reacted to her loss have lamented the incident and called out the Trump administration for falsely blaming her for her fate. However, one of the late victim's former family members, her ex-father-in-law, has now broken the silence on what he thinks of the ICE shooting and his former daughter-in-law's death.Timmy Macklin is the father of Good's late ex-husband, Tim Macklin Jr. who was her second husband and died in 2023. He is also the grandfather of her 6-year-old son, Emerson.Speaking on CNN's Erin Burnett OutFront on Tuesday, Macklin, a proud Republican and Trump supporter, said he believed the circumstances around Good's death were ""hard for everybody involved.""“I’m not blaming anybody,” he said. “I mean, the ICE agent, you know, at first I didn‘t see the footage where... he was actually being rammed.I mean, I‘ve seen the bumper of the car hitting his legs. And so in a flash like that, it‘s hard to say how you would react.”“Do I agree with everything that she did? Absolutely not,” he added, about Good.The deeply religious individual also described Good's wife Becca as a ""great person"" but added, ""I think there’s some bad choices... if we’re walking in the spirit of God, I don’t think she would have been there. That’s the way I look at it.""Jonathan Ross, the ICE agent who shot Good in the head on January 7, 2026, called her a ""f****** b****"" in the video footage of the incident shot on his camera. Calling out the ICE agent, Good's father-in-law said that he needs to turn to the Bible. “His statement that he made after the incident, the things he called her, I mean, that‘s definitely showing evidence that he that he don‘t know the Lord like he should,” said Macklin.On Tuesday, CBS Evening News anchor Tony Dokoupil relayed to the President that he had been in conversation with Good's biological father who is a Trump voter, despite his daughter's apparent opposition to ICE.“I’ve been speaking to her father, who is a big supporter of yours, like many Americans are, but he’s heartbroken right now,” Dokoupil said. “He’s also heartbroken because your administration so quickly has come out and said she’s a domestic terrorist.”“I would bet you that she, under normal circumstances, was a very solid, wonderful person. But her actions were pretty tough. I’ve seen it many ways and many different shapes and forms,” replied Trump.When Burnett played Trump's message to Macklin, he claimed: “I’m a Trump supporter myself.”“Renee was an amazing person, she was full of life, full of joy, a real gentle, good mother. I just think we make bad choices and that’s the problem,” he added.","Timmy Macklin is the father of Renee Good's late ex-husband, Tim Macklin Jr. He is also the grandfather of her 6-year-old son, Emerson.

An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer who shot and killed Renee Good, a Minneapolis woman whose death sparked outrage across the country, suffered from internal bleeding after the incident, a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official confirmed with The Hill.The extent of ICE officer Jonathan Ross ’s bleeding remained unclear. Video taken of the incident showed Ross walking up and down the street after Good was shot and killed./Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said following the shooting on January 7 that Ross was hospitalised after the shooting. Noem claimed Good struck the officer with her SUV, which she later called an act of “domestic terrorism.”“The officer was hit by the vehicle,” Noem told reporters at a press conference. “She hit him. He went to the hospital. A doctor did treat him. He has been released.”Good’s death drew condemnation and expanded Minnesota’s growing tensions with the federal govt, which was previously focused on a growing welfare fraud scandal.Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey (D) said that most protests in his city, which drew thousands of protesters since Good was killed, were peaceful. They carried on through the weekend, with some protesters facing off with federal officers, who deployed tear gas while clad in helmets and carrying batons.Frey and other state and local officials told ICE to stop its operations in Minnesota. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Monday that the state sued the Trump administration to block a federal immigration enforcement surge in the Gopher State.“This has to stop,” Ellison said. “Let’s be clear: it never should have started. These agents have no good reason to be here.”DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin called it “astounding that the Left can miraculously rediscover the Tenth Amendment when they don’t want federal law enforcement officers to enforce federal law.”President Trump, who also defended Ross since Good’s death, told CBS News’s Tony Dokoupil that her actions “were pretty tough” before she was killed.“I would bet you that she, under normal circumstances, was a very solid, wonderful person,” Trump told Dokoupil in a message to Good’s father, a supporter of the President. “But her actions were pretty tough.”","Renee Good, a Minneapolis woman whose death sparked outrage across the country, suffered from internal bleeding after the incident.

Explained: How Greenland fits into Donald Trump's $175 billion Golden Dome missile shield,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/explained-how-greenland-fits-into-donald-trumps-175-billion-golden-dome-missile-shield/articleshow/126531929.cms,"'Mind Your Own Business!': Trump RAGES As Greenland PM Picks Denmark Over US | 'NATO Ineffective...'

Is Trump’s obsession with making Greenland the 51st state of the United States linked with his “Golden Dome”, a $175 Billion, multi-layered missile defense system?

Missile paths cross Greenland

Greenland hosts key US space assets

Arctic is vital for space control

China and Russia raise the stakes





US President Donald Trump said American control of Greenland was “vital” for the Golden Dome defence system, arguing it was needed for US national security and for Nato’s effectiveness.“The United States needs Greenland for the purpose of National Security. It is vital for the Golden Dome that we are building,” Trump, who has vowed to seize the Arctic island from ally Denmark, wrote on social media.“Nato becomes far more formidable and effective with Greenland in the hands of the UNITED STATES. Anything less than that is unacceptable.”And the answer is Yes. Greenland’s importance to the Golden Dome lies in its geography, space infrastructure, missile-flight paths, and Arctic dominance, not merely politics or raw materials.Greenland, positioned between the US and Russia, was described as an area of high strategic importance for Americans and for Arctic security, and as a territory known for untapped raw materials, from oil and gas reserves to critical mineral deposits, Eurasian Times reported.Russian ballistic missiles aimed at the United States would likely fly over Greenland because the shortest route runs across the Arctic.This makes Greenland an ideal place to spot, track, and intercept missiles early. Missile defence works best when sensors and interceptors are positioned close to the missile’s flight path.Greenland is home to Pituffik Space Base, formerly known as Thule Air Base. It is now part of the US Space Force. The base supports missile-warning radars, satellite tracking, and space surveillance. The Golden Dome relies on these space-based systems, not just ground defences.Satellites in polar orbit pass over the High North many times a day. Greenland is one of the best locations on Earth to command satellites, relay data, and coordinate space-based missile defence. Experts say it is second only to Norway’s Svalbard—but it is closer to the US and easier to protect, as per Eurasian Times.Russia is militarising the Arctic, and China is expanding its influence there. Both are developing anti-satellite weapons and long-range missiles. The Golden Dome is designed to counter this combined threat from the north and from space.","Greenland is home to Pituffik Space Base, formerly known as Thule Air Base.

Turkey is seeking to join a defence alliance between nuclear-armed Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, this can be seen as an effort in direction to reshape security alignments in the Middle East region and beyond, as Bloomberg reported.The pact, initially signed by Pakistan and Saudi Arabia in September, reportedly states that “any aggression” against one member would be treated as an attack on all -- a provision that mirrors Article 5 of Nato, of which Turkey is a member and fields the second-largest military after the US.Talks on Turkey’s entry are said to be at an advanced stage, with a deal appearing likely, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg on condition of anonymity.Bloomberg reported that the expanded alliance reflects growing overlap in the strategic interests of Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan across South Asia, the Middle East and parts of Africa.Turkey also sees the arrangement as a way to strengthen its security and deterrence posture at a time when questions persist over US reliability and President Donald Trump’s commitment to Nato, despite Washington’s close military ties with all three countries.Saudi Arabia would bring financial strength to the grouping, Pakistan its nuclear capability, ballistic missiles and manpower, while Turkey contributes military experience and a rapidly expanding defence industry, said Nihat Ali Ozcan, a strategist with Ankara-based think tank TEPAV.“As the US prioritizes its own interests and that of Israel in the region, changing dynamics and fallout from regional conflicts are prompting countries to develop new mechanisms to identify friends and foes,” Ozcan said.Turkish defence ministry declined to comment on the report. Pakistan’s information ministry did not respond to requests for comment, while Saudi officials were unavailable over the weekend.If Turkey formally joins the pact, it would highlight a new phase in relations with Saudi Arabia, once rivals for leadership of the Sunni Muslim world. After years of strained ties, the two countries are now deepening economic and defence cooperation, including holding their first-ever naval meeting in Ankara this week, according to the Turkish defence ministry.Despite shared concerns over Shiite-majority Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia favour engagement with Tehran rather than confrontation. They also back a stable, Sunni-led Syria and support Palestinian statehood.Turkey and Pakistan already enjoy close military ties. Ankara is building corvette warships for Pakistan’s navy, has upgraded Islamabad’s F-16 fighter jets, and shares drone technology with both Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. Bloomberg previously reported that Turkey now wants both countries to join its Kaan fifth-generation fighter jet programme.The trilateral defence discussions come after a ceasefire between India and Pakistan ended a four-day military clash and high tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May. Regional tensions remain high, however, with Pakistan and Afghanistan at odds following clashes and accusations by Islamabad that the Taliban is sheltering hostile militant groups.Turkey and Qatar have mediated talks between the sides, though those efforts have so far failed to produce a breakthrough, Bloomberg reported.","Turkey is seeking to join a defence alliance between nuclear-armed Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.

Open Letter From Pakistan Backs India As Baloch Leader Signals Diplomatic Break With Islamabad





A fresh surge of enforced disappearances has been reported across Balochistan, Karachi, and adjoining regions, with nine more Baloch citizens allegedly taken away by Pakistsecurity agencies in recent weeks.Human rights defenders stated that these incidents follow a familiar pattern: individuals are arrested without warrants, held in secret locations, and never brought before a court, as reported by The Balochistan Post.According to The Balochistan Post, sources in Mand, Kech district, stated that Abdullah, son of Iqbal, was whisked away and shifted to an unknown facility. In Karachi, 24-year-old student Hamdan, son of Muhammad Ali, was detained by CTD officials in the Golimar area, with no subsequent legal proceedings or public acknowledgement of his custody.On November 2, 2025, three youths, Dawood Baloch, Usman Baloch, and Hakeem Majeed Baloch, were picked up during early-morning raids in Bhatta Colony by teams from Military Intelligence and the CTD. Their whereabouts remain undisclosed.Additional cases include the late-night detention of religious instructor Zubair from Quetta's Lak Pass area on November 20; the abduction of labourer Muhammad Iqbal Marri from outside the Rakhni Sessions Court in Barkhan on December 26; and the raid in Mastung on 11 December in which Frontier Corps and CTD personnel allegedly took 21-year-old herder Saeed Ahmed.Families say none of these detainees have resurfaced. According to another report, 17-year-old student Jamal Murad was apprehended in Gwadar on 2 January by CTD and Military Intelligence operatives, after which he disappeared.The Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP) continued its protest camp outside the Quetta Press Club, marking its 6,052nd day. Families, including the relatives of Nasreena Baloch, reportedly detained during a raid in Hub Chowki, joined the demonstration.Her family stated that local police refused to register an FIR, while the Hub Press Club was locked to stop their press briefing, as highlighted by The Balochistan Post.VBMP Chairman Nasrullah Baloch accused state institutions of weaponising national security to intensify enforced disappearances, even targeting Baloch women. He said detainees are denied legal rights, courts are bypassed, and new laws merely protect extrajudicial actions.He called on national and international bodies to take meaningful steps to end the crisis and secure the release of all missing persons, as reported by The Balochistan Post.","A fresh surge of enforced disappearances has been reported across Balochistan, Karachi, and adjoining regions.

No IMF Loan In 6 Months? Pakistan Defence Minister’s Jet Export Claim Collapses Under Debt Reality





Pakistan on Saturday claimed that Iraq has expressed “keen interest” in acquiring JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak training aircraft, following talks between the air chiefs of the two countries.According to a statement issued by the Pakistan Army, air chief marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu, chief of air staff of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF), met lieutenant general staff pilot Mohanad Ghalib Mohammed Radi Al-Asadi, commander of the Iraqi Air Force, during an official visit to Iraq.The discussions focused on enhancing bilateral military cooperation, including joint training, capacity building and operational coordination.“The Iraqi air chief praised PAF’s professionalism and technological advancement, expressed interest in benefiting from PAF’s world-class training and expressed keen interest in JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak trainer aircraft,” the statement said, as quoted by news agency PTI.Both sides also agreed to pursue joint exercises and training initiatives to strengthen interoperability between the two air forces.The JF-17 Thunder is a single-engine, lightweight combat aircraft jointly developed by China’s Chengdu Aircraft Corporation and the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex.Pakistan has claimed that the aircraft proved its capabilities during last year’s conflict with India, although its effectiveness remains disputed.Pakistan had also deployed Chinese-origin J-10 fighter jets during the May 7–10 hostilities with India.The development comes days after Pakistan and Bangladesh air chiefs held talks on the “potential procurement” of JF-17 jets by Dhaka. However, Bangladesh has not officially confirmed any such plan.Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif recently claimed that the country has seen increased interest in its fighter aircraft following the May 2025 standoff with India. Reports have also suggested that Pakistan is exploring similar defence deals with other countries, including Saudi Arabia, amid ongoing financial pressures.Notably, Pakistan has repeatedly relied on International Monetary Fund support in recent years, with the IMF approving a $7 billion bailout in September 2024 and an additional $1.4 billion loan in May 2025.",Iraq has expressed “keen interest’ in acquiring JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak training aircraft.

'Cry of a wounded conscience': Hindu man killed in Pakistan; sparks widespread protests in Sindh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/cry-of-a-wounded-conscience-hindu-man-killed-in-pakistan-sparks-widespread-protests-in-sindh/articleshow/126447724.cms,"Hindu Farmer Killing in Sindh Triggers Protests A Day After India Exposed Pak's Record on Minorities





Widespread protests erupted in Pakistan’s Sindh province after a young Hindu farmer was killed by a landlord in Badin.According to a report by Pakistan's news outlet the Nation, Kailash Kolhi was shot dead by an influential landlord, Sarfaraz Nizamani, over the construction of a hut on his land.Following Kolhi’s death, demonstrators staged sit-ins on the Badin–Hyderabad National Highway and the Badin–Thar Coal Road. Hundreds of vehicles remained stranded for hours as protesters demanded justice for the killing of Kolhi and vowed not to disperse until those responsible are arrested.According to a statement shared by activist Shiva Kachhi, the protest has been ongoing without pause.“The protest for the arrest of the killers of the martyred Kailash Kolhi is making history. Shiva Kachhi, Chairman of Pakistan Darawar Ittehad, is leading the historic protest sit-in. This was not just a protest—it was the cry of a wounded conscience. From 10:00 am yesterday until late into the night, the sit-in continued without pause, proving that the demand for justice cannot be silenced,” Kachhi said in a social media post on X.“Men, women, elderly people, and innocent children stayed on the streets with one voice and one demand: justice for Kailash Kolhi.Arrest the killers. Despite exhaustion, hunger, and the cold of the night, the determination of the protesters remained unshaken. Kailash Kolhi’s only ‘crime’ was that he was poor, marginalised, and courageous enough to exist in a system that protects the powerful and crushes the weak. The tears of his children, the grief of his mother, and the silent agony of his widow are today questioning the entire system: Is the blood of the poor so cheap?” he added.Earlier, the victim’s family and community members staged a protest by placing the body at Piru Lashari Stop, where the SSP Badin assured them that the accused would be arrested within 24 hours.The incident occurred four days ago in Raho Kolhi village in the Piru Lashari city area. Despite assurances from district police officials, the main accused has yet to be arrested.The ongoing protest has drawn participation from leaders and workers of several political, nationalist, religious, and social organisations, including Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI), Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Jiye Sindh Mahaz, Qaumi Awami Tehreek, Jeay Sindh Qaumi Mahaz (Bashir Qureshi group), and Awami Tehreek, The Nation reported.","Kailash Kolhi was shot dead by an influential landlord, Sarfaraz Nizamani, over the construction of a hut on his land.

Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif in a controversial statement has urged the United States and Turkey to “kidnap” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if they believed in justice and humanity, over the Israel-Gaza conflict.In a televised interview, whose clips have now gone viral on social media, Asif said the US should apprehend Netanyahu “just as Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was taken away.”He added that Turkey could also seize the Israeli leader, and “Pakistanis are praying for it.”Describing Netanyahu as the “worst criminal of humanity,” Asif claimed that “no atrocities in history match those committed against Palestinians in Gaza.” He added, “No community has done what Israel has done to Palestinians in the last 4,000-5,000 years. He [Netanyahu] is the biggest criminal of humanity. The world has not seen a bigger criminal.”Asif also appeared to raise the issue of penalising those he termed as enablers of such crimes, beginning a sentence with, “And what does the law say about those who support such criminals…” before the show’s anchor, Hamid Mir, interjected and called for a break.Mir warned that Asif’s remarks risked being interpreted as a veiled reference to US President Donald Trump, and indicated that Asif would not remain on air after the break.Pakistan does not have formal diplomatic relations with Israel and has historically expressed strong support for the Palestinian cause. Islamabad also maintains close ties with Iran, another regional critic of Israeli policies.The international criminal court (ICC) has previously issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu in connection with alleged war crimes in Gaza, a legal development referenced during the interview.","Khawaja Asif said the US should apprehend Netanyahu “just as Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was taken away” He added that Turkey could also seize the Israeli leader, and “Pakistanis are praying for it” Asif also appeared to raise the issue of penalising those he termed as enablers of such crimes.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126438854,imgsize-837064,width-400,resizemode-4/khawaja-asif-file.jpg"
Gen Z uprising in Pakistan? PhD student's article challenges those in power — why it was taken down,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/gen-z-uprising-in-pakistan-phd-students-article-challenges-those-in-power-why-it-was-taken-down/articleshow/126409692.cms,"Badshahi Mosque, Lahore (AP photo)





Is Pakistan heading towards a Gen Z uprising? A PhD student from the country has sparked a debate after critically examining present-day Pakistan, under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and army chief and de facto power centre Asim Munir , without naming either directly.The piece, written through a lens that shows contrast in powerful boomer generation and youth of Gen Z-Alpha, quickly struck a chord online and became a flashpoint for what many described as a quiet rebellion. It highlighted the widening divide between Pakistan’s ruling establishment, often referred to as “Boomers,” and its increasingly restless Gen Z population.The article, titled “It is over,” was written by US-based PhD student Zorain Nizamani and published in Pakistan’s daily The Express Tribune on January 1. It was later taken down, reportedly following pressure from the Pakistani military.“For the older men and women in power, it's over. The young generation isn't buying any of what you're trying to sell to them. No matter how many talks and seminars you arrange in schools and colleges, trying to promote patriotism, it isn't working,” Nizamani wrote.Writing from the perspective of Gen Z and Generation Alpha, Nizamani rejected what he described as an imposed narrative of patriotism pushed by those in power, arguing that such efforts no longer resonate with young Pakistanis.“Young minds, the Gen Z, the alphas, they know exactly what is happening, and despite your consistent efforts of trying to 'sell' your views of patriotism to them, they are seeing right through it. Thanks to the internet, thanks to whatever little education we have left, despite your best efforts of keeping the masses as illiterate as possible, you have failed. You have failed to tell people what to think, they are thinking for themselves. They might be a little too scared to speak their minds because they prefer breathing,” Nizamani wrote.He argued that forced patriotism, speeches and seminars cannot replace justice, opportunity and basic rights, and said young people clearly see corruption, inequality and hypocrisy despite censorship and propaganda.Nizamani also highlighted generational differences over economic freedom, writing, “The Gen Z wants erased restrictions on freelancing, the boomers want to increase regulations on freelancing.”Concluding his article, he wrote: “Boomers, we have had enough. We aren't buying your narrative anymore. It's worn out.”The article drew support from followers of former prime minister Imran Khan, who is currently incarcerated. The Canada wing of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaaf (PTI) shared the article on X, highlighting its key points.“Zorain Nizamani's article ‘It is Over’ was removed from eTribune most likely for exposing the reality: DG ISPR's university visits are futile. The youth see through propaganda and are no longer easy to mislead or control,” the PTI Canada wing said.Pakistani activist Mehlaqa Samdani also linked the article’s removal to censorship. “Not surprisingly, this article is no longer accessible through the Express Tribune's digital edition, exactly the kind of censorship Zorain talks about,” she wrote.The episode has intensified online debate over whether Pakistan’s younger generation is moving from quiet disillusionment toward open resistance against an entrenched establishment widely seen as out of touch.","US-based PhD student Zorain Nizamani wrote an article on Pakistan's ruling establishment.

No IMF Loan In 6 Months? Pakistan Defence Minister’s Jet Export Claim Collapses Under Debt Reality

Pakistan's repeated reliance on IMF

Bangladesh shows interest in Pak's JF-17

Pak seeks JF-17 deal with Saudi Arabia





Pakistan on Tuesday expressed confidence that it may no longer need financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund within six months, with Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif claiming the country had seen a surge in aircraft orders following a four-day military standoff with India in May, Geo TV reported.Speaking on a Geo News programme, Asif made a fanciful claim while arguing that the May 2025 India-Pakistan conflict showcased Pakistan's ""resolve and military effectiveness"" to the world.Military tensions escalated in May 2025 after Pakistan-sponsored terrorists carried out a terror attack in Pahalgam, killing 26 civilians in April. India responded with a strong military operation, launching Operation Sindoor, under which it targeted and destroyed multiple terror camps and Pakistani military facilities.However, Khawaja Asif, appearing disconnected from the ground reality, made such statements after a Bangladeshi defence delegation met Pakistan's air chief to discuss a potential sale of the JF-17 Thunder, the multi-role fighter aircraft jointly developed by China and Pakistan.There are also reports of talks between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to convert about $2 billion in Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, according to two Pakistani sources cited by Reuters.According to Arab News, several countries have since stepped up defence engagement with Pakistan.“Right now, the number of orders we are receiving after reaching this point is significant because our aircraft have been tested,” defence minister Asif told Pakistan’s Geo News channel.“We are receiving these orders, and it is possible that after six months we may not even need the IMF,” he said.Pakistan markets the Chinese co-developed JF-17 as a lower-cost multi-role fighter and has positioned itself as a supplier offering aircraft, training and maintenance outside Western supply chains.“I am saying this with full confidence,” Asif said. “If all these orders materialise over the next six months, we will not need the IMF.”Pakistan has repeatedly turned to the International Monetary Fund over the years, for financial support to stabilise its fragile economy, with such assistance tied to strict conditions including fiscal reforms, subsidy cuts and revenue-enhancing measures.In September 2024, the IMF approved a $7 billion bailout for Pakistan under its Extended Fund Facility (EFF), followed by a separate $1.4 billion loan under its climate resilience fund in May 2025, aimed at bolstering the country’s economic stability and climate resilience.Demonstrating Dhaka’s efforts to move closer to Islamabad, Bangladesh has expressed “potential interest” in acquiring the JF-17 Thunder fighter aircraft from Pakistan, along with plans to resume direct flights between the two countries from January 29 after a gap of more than a decade.The JF-17, jointly developed by China and Pakistan, was deployed by Pakistan against India during the May 7–10 hostilities. In November last year, Indian Air Force chief Air chief Marshal A P Singh said the aircraft was among at least five high-tech Pakistani fighters shot down during Operation Sindoor.This latest development and closeness between Pakistan and Bangladesh comes under the pretext of Dhaka's straining relations with India.Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are also in talks to convert around $2 billion in Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, as two Pakistani sources told Reuters, in a move that would deepen military cooperation between two Islamic nations. Pakistan and Saudi signed a mutual defence pact last year.The discussions highlight efforts by the long-time allies to operationalise defence cooperation at a time when Pakistan is under acute financial strain and Saudi Arabia is recalibrating its security partnerships amid uncertainty over US commitments in the Middle East.","Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Asif says country may not need IMF help in six months.

Pakistan’s Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry on Tuesday said that nearly 71% of terrorist incidents reported in 2025 originated from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). He attributed this concentration to a “politically conducive environment and the flourishing political-criminal-terror-nexus which is flourishing there”.Data released by the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) reinforces the scale of the surge. KP recorded the sharpest rise in violence, with “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025” — a year-on-year increase of more than 40%.The broader national picture is even starker. According to the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS), 2025 was the “deadliest” year in a decade, with 3,387 combat-related deaths. These included 2,115 terrorists, 664 security personnel, 580 civilians and 28 members of pro-government peace committees. PICSS said violence intensified in both “tempo and lethality”, pushing multiple security indicators to their highest levels in years.“Militant attacks climbed to their highest annual total since 2014, and the use of suicide bombings and small drones showed a clear upward trend,” the report said.Suicide attacks rose by 53%, while terrorist incidents overall increased to 1,063 — the highest since 2014.Security forces and civilians also bore rising costs. Security personnel fatalities rose 26% to their highest level since 2011, while civilian deaths increased by 24%, marking the worst toll in a decade. Injuries surged by 53% to 2,263, with sharp rises across all categories.The violence has been most acute in KP and Balochistan. In Bannu alone, Deputy Inspector General Sajjad Khan said 27 police personnel were killed in 134 attacks during 2025. Police carried out 168 intelligence-based operations, arresting 105 militants and killing 65, he said.Pakistan frequently accuses Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities of sheltering the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group blamed for a sharp increase in attacks inside Pakistan since 2021. Afghan officials reject the allegations, insisting they do not permit their territory to be used for attacks against other countries.While the TTP operates independently from Afghanistan’s Taliban, the two groups maintain close ties.Relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan have deteriorated since October, when border clashes followed explosions in Kabul on Oct. 9 that Afghan officials attributed to Pakistan. Although Qatar later helped mediate a ceasefire, talks hosted by Turkey in November failed to produce a lasting agreement.","KP recorded the sharpest rise in violence, with “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025’ The broader national picture is even starker. 2025 was the “deadliest” year in a decade, with 3,387 combat-related deaths.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126375028,imgsize-1338682,width-400,resizemode-4/photo-credit-ap.jpg"

ISLAMABAD: The polio vaccination campaign in Pakistan's merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa fell short of its target, leaving over 935,000 children under five unvaccinated, officials said, citing security challenges and population displacement as key hurdles, The Express Tribune reported.According to The Express Tribune, citing authorities, thousands of families from North and South Waziristan, Bajaur, and other merged districts have migrated to different parts of the country, complicating monitoring and vaccination efforts.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa reported 19 polio cases in 2025, including four each in North Waziristan, Lakki Marwat, and Tank; three in Bannu; two in Torghar; and one each in Dera Ismail Khan and Lower Kohistan, as reported by The Express Tribune.Officials noted that staffing and operational support for WHO and Unicef programmes in the merged districts were reduced last year, while WHO funding cuts also affected campaign coverage, leaving children in these areas at heightened risk.In Sindh, more than 12,000 children under five were reportedly missed during the final polio drive of 2025 in Hyderabad and surrounding areas, according to The Express Tribune.Refusals were recorded mainly in Cantonment areas and municipal towns such as Hussainabad, Preetabad, Qasimabad, and Tando Jam, with absent households and parental refusals cited as primary reasons.Despite these gaps, the nationwide anti-polio campaign successfully vaccinated more than 44.6 million children across Pakistan, according to The Express Tribune.Punjab led with 22.9 million children vaccinated, followed by Sindh with 10.6 million, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with 7.15 million, and Balochistan with 2.58 million.Officials said contributions from other regions also added to the national tally.Authorities warned that without sustained vaccination efforts, particularly in displaced and high-risk populations, children in the merged districts remain vulnerable to polio, The Express Tribune reported.","Polio vaccination campaign in Pakistan's merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa fell short of its target.
