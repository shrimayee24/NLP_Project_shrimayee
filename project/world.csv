NEW DELHI: Karnataka Congress MLA Ravikumar Gowda Ganiga sparked controversy on Monday by saying that actress Rashmika Mandanna should be “taught a lesson” for allegedly disregarding Kannada.Speaking to news agency ANI, Gowda criticised Rashmika for not attending the International Film Festival last year despite being multiple invitations. “Rashmika, who started her career with the Kannada film Kirik Party, refused to attend the festival. She said she has her house in Hyderabad and doesn’t know where Karnataka is. One of our legislators visited her house 10-12 times to invite her, but she refused and disregarded Kannada, despite growing up in this industry. Shouldn’t we teach her a lesson?” the Congress MLA said.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) jumped quickly to condemn Gowda’s comments, calling them unconstitutional. Union minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar took to X, criticising the Congress MLA and calling his statement an example of “Congress goon culture.”""You can never separate goon from a Rahul Congressman. This pompous Karnataka MLA from Rahul Gandhi’s party wants to 'teach a lesson' to an actress. Every citizen, including actresses, has rights.

RAIPUR: A hardcore Maoist - described by police as ""Bijapur's most violent Naxal commander"" - who was involved in multiple ambushes that claimed the lives of at least 100 security personnel has surrendered before Bijapur police.Cops identified him as Dinesh Modiyam , secretary of Gangaloor committee - a unit feared for brutal murders of villagers, off-duty police personnel, and even fellow cadres. He was in the rank of ""divisional committee member"" in the insurgent outfit, said an officer.Dinesh and his wife Kala Tati, a Maoist ""area committee member"", came with their child to surrender. Police said he gave up arms because he feared for his own life. Now that the Maoist organisation is battered and its cadres scattered with haphazard command and control, Dinesh's bloodthirsty past was coming back to haunt him, and he feared he would be killed by his own men, said an officer.Dinesh's surrender is being seen as a body blow to Maoists but it puts the Chhattisgarh administration in a quandary.","Dinesh Modiyam was secretary of Gangaloor committee - a unit feared for brutal murders of villagers, off-duty police personnel, and even fellow cadres.

Comedian Spanky Hayes says Kobe Bryant had a fight with a singer over Brandy

Comedianrecently shared an untold story about the late Kobe Bryant , claiming the basketball legend once got into a physical altercation over singer. During an appearance on the Kid L Podcast, Hayes recounted his time hanging out with a 17-year-old Bryant and revealed a surprising incident involving the NBA icon and his alleged romance story.Popular comedian Spanky Hayes recently shared a bombshell story about the late Kobe Bryant , revealing that he once had a romantic interest in singer Brandy.“I did a lot of background work for Moesha ,” Hayes recalled. “He [Bryant] went with Brandy, that was his girlfriend or they went to the prom or some sh*t. I see him sock Wanya from Boyz II Men in the mouth over her with a cast on… Kobe just took the b***h and socked him. Bam!”While there’s no way to confirm the story, it adds to the lore surrounding Bryant’s younger years before he became a five-time NBA champion. What is well-documented, however, is Bryant’s close connection with Brandy.Bryant and Brandy’s friendship dates back to 1996 when the two met at the Essence Awards. At the time, Brandy was a teenage R&B sensation and the star of Moesha, while Bryant was a high school basketball phenom on his way to the NBA. The two hit it off, and Bryant later asked Brandy to be his prom date.“He asked me to go to the prom with him, and since he was a nice guy … I asked my mom, and she said yes,” Brandy told the New York Daily News at the time.The decision made headlines, and Bryant’s prom night became a major spectacle. Held at the Bellevue Hotel in Philadelphia, the event required extra security to accommodate the influx of media attention. Brandy wore a champagne-colored Moschino dress with a matching shawl, while Bryant sported a sleek black tuxedo. The two arrived in a limo, and despite the initial buzz, classmates later described the evening as relatively normal once the couple got past the press.“Once they got past the press, people just treated it like, ‘Oh, hi, Brandy,’” recalled classmate Dan Gross.Despite their chemistry, Brandy has clarified over the years that the two never officially dated. However, their friendship remained strong, and just months after the prom, Bryant made a guest appearance on Moesha, playing a high school basketball player.Bryant’s legacy extends far beyond his high school years and his brief Hollywood ties. Tragically, he passed away on January 26, 2020, in a helicopter crash that also claimed the life of his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, and seven others.In the wake of his passing, Brandy paid tribute by sharing a heartfelt image of Bryant and Gianna on Instagram, writing, “Never will I understand. My condolences to @vanessabryant, and all families who are in pain during this tragic time.”Also Read: Legacy or Business: Fans Find Vanessa Bryant and Nike Guilty of Milking Kobe Bryant's Name for Monetary Gains Now, five years after his untimely death, Bryant's impact continues to be felt, not just in basketball but across the world.",Comedian Spanky Hayes says Kobe Bryant had a fight with a singer over Brandy.

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are hoping to have a baby boy

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have been a subject of engagement rumors since early 2025, and recent tarot card readings suggest that they may be starting a family. Despite their high-profile lives, they have shown unwavering support for each other. Fans are eagerly awaiting news of an official engagement, and recent tarot card readings suggest that a baby is also on the horizon.Inbaal Honigman, a tarot card reader, suggests that Swift and Kelce may be planning to expand their family soon. Honigman dismissed rumors of Swift being pregnant, but her reading strongly suggests a pregnancy in the near future. Not only do the tarot cards suggest a baby is in the couple's future, but they also indicate that Swift and Kelce are hoping for a boy.""The Lovers tarot card says that the couple have made a start on their 'TTC' (trying to conceive) journey, as they want to have a lovely little family of their own ASAP,"" Honigman said. ""This tarot card reveals that both are hoping for a boy, or two boys, who will be just like them.""Sportscasting.com sports traders predict a 12.5% chance that Swift and Kelce will name their son Edward or Scott in honor of their fathers, according to betting odds. ""If it's a boy, the betting experts are also suggesting it will be another family theme with both Edward and Scott big fancies due to these being the names of Swift and Kelce's fathers,"" said Sportscasting.com spokesman Andy Newton. ""Scottie Swift has a nice ring to it, and if he ends up following his dad into American football, he'll need to be fast with a name like that!""""He definitely wants to be a dada, but he's uncertain that he'll find it as straightforward as Taylor expects to,"" Honigman said. ""This is an interesting card of a team struggle which brings multiple rewards. He'd love to have at least three babies, possibly even five.”The possibility of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce having a baby in 2025 is leaving fans abuzz, but everyone wants to know how many kids the pair would have in the future. Although Swift appears happy to wait before embracing motherhood, insiders indicate that Travis Kelce already wants to have children. In April 2024, a source close to Kelce informed Life & Style that Kelce was prepared to marry Swift ""immediately"" and would adore having kids immediately after—perhaps even before officially marrying.Also Read: Is a break-up on the way? Taylor Swift reportedly advised to distance herself from Travis Kelce amid growing backlash and its impact on the Chiefs' TE Tarot reader Honigman says that both Kelce and Swift differ slightly in their views. Swift's reading produced the Judgment card, which represents that she considers motherhood a thrilling and rewarding experience. She probably imagines having two kids but secretly wishes for at least one more. Kelce's 5 of Wands card indicates that he is being pragmatic about fatherhood, given the difficulties that can accompany it.","Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are hoping to have a baby boy, according to tarot readings.

Trump has DISASTER SUNDAY as he LIMPS AROUND

A video of US President Donald Trump appearing to 'limp' during a weekend golf outing has gone viral on social media, fuelling speculation about his health.The widely circulated footage, taken at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate , shows the 78-year-old president on the golf course in Palm Beach, Florida, on Sunday afternoon.In the clip, Trump appears to struggle as he exits his golf cart, seemingly dragging his right leg before stepping up to take his swing.According to Daily Mail, the video quickly sparked discussions online, with many social media users questioning his mobility. Some X users described his leg movement as ""wobbly,"" ""pigeon-toed,"" or ""far from stable,"" while others speculated about possible health issues, including ""weak knees"" or an undisclosed neuromuscular condition.A user on social media wrote: ""Donald Trump moves his right leg like a piece of wood?""The speculation follows recent concerns over Trump’s health after photos surfaced last week showing a yellow and purple bruise on his right hand during a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron at the White House.Also read: White House explains bruise on Trump's hand: 'Man of the people' The White House attributed the bruise to the president shaking hands with hundreds of people during campaign events and official duties.Earlier, Trump’s campaign swiftly pushed back against the latest wave of health rumours.In a statement on Monday, spokesman Steven Cheung dismissed the concerns as politically motivated attacks. ""Deranged and morally bankrupt liberals—including corrupt media—have now resorted to complete falsehoods and fabricated lies because they have no shame,"" Cheung said. ""Instead, they spend every waking hour suffering from a debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has rotted their brain.""Speculation about Trump’s right leg mobility has persisted for years, with scrutiny intensifying in recent months. However, the White House has not provided any indication that the president is facing a serious medical issue.","Video of US President Donald Trump appearing to 'limp' during a weekend golf outing has gone viral on social media.

The pummeling felt like it would never end, and I protected my head by putting my arms up like I learned how to do in boxing. Blood was streaming down my head, and my hands were beat brown. They brought duct tape and masks and were armed with handguns.""Amouranth also explained why she tweeted instead of calling emergency services. ""Was at gunpoint, they gave me [my] phone and said log in with gun to my head, and I tweeted because calling would be a death sentence,"" she wrote.Following the attack, the Houston Police Officers’ Union issued a statement on X, urging anyone with information to contact the Houston Police Robbery Division or Crime Stoppers of Houston.Security experts warn that cryptocurrency investors are increasingly being targeted due to bitcoin’s surging value.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced they would also impose retaliatory tariffs on the US after President Donald Trump confirmed that his administration would impose levies against Canada and Mexico on Tuesday.Trudeau announced on late Monday that Canada will implement 25% tariffs on C$155 billion ($107 billion) of American goods starting Tuesday if the US proceeds with its proposed tariffs on Canadian products.Canada will slap 25% tariffs on C$30 billion worth of US goods from Tuesday, while levies on the remaining C$125 billion will be enforced after 21 days, according to Trudeau's statement.""Today, after a 30-day pause, the United States administration has decided to proceed with imposing 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian exports and 10 per cent tariffs on Canadian energy.

US Senate blocks GOP-led bill to ban trans athletes from competing in women’s sports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-senate-blocks-gop-led-bill-to-ban-trans-athletes-from-competing-in-womens-sports/articleshow/118695140.cms,"President Donald Trump had signed an executive order to ban transgender athletes from women's sports(AP)

Democrats on Monday blocked a Republican-written bill, aimed at preventing transgender women and girls from competing in female school athletics nationwide. The measure, which Republicans had emphasised during previous elections, fell short of the required 60 votes, resulting in a 51-45 party-line division.The legislation attempted to establish Title IX protections based on biological characteristics at birth. Republicans have consistently focused on this matter, presenting it as a question of athletic fairness for women and girls, AP news agency reported.Last month, President Donald Trump issued an executive order granting federal agencies discretion to ensure Title IX compliance by federal funding recipients, based on birth-assigned gender. Congressional Republicans sought to codify this interpretation by modifying the 1972 Title IX law, which safeguards against sex-based discrimination in federally-assisted education programmes.Senate Majority Leader John Thune stated, ""Around the country we have seen men - biological men who identify as women - take up spaces and medals in athletics meant for actual women. This is a matter of fairness and equality.""""Democrats can stand for women or stand with a radical transgender ideology,"" he added. If they opposed the legislation, he said, ""they'll have to answer to the women and girls they vote to disenfranchise.""Despite passing in the House with minimal Democratic support, the Senate outcome highlighted challenges facing LGBTQ-focused legislation. Democrats criticised the bill as diverting attention from crucial issues and overstepping into local education decisions.Senator Brian Schatz declared, ""What Republicans are doing today is inventing a problem to stir up a culture war and divide people against each other.""Senator Tammy Baldwin noted, ""This is a decision for sports leagues to thoughtfully craft policy that actually takes seriously what is best for all players, not blanket mandates that will undoubtedly have unintended consequences for the safety of all students.""Republicans maintain their focus on this issue, with Trump's campaign finding broader appeal beyond party boundaries.In Minnesota, the state House prepared for similar discussions on GOP legislation affecting primary and secondary schools. Supporters gathered at St Paul's Capitol steps, advocating for girls' sports opportunities and fair competition.","The legislation attempted to establish Title IX protections based on biological characteristics at birth.

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy found himself at the center of a bizarre and embarrassing diplomatic blunder after taking a seat in a White House meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance. A gesture of goodwill towards global cooperation turned into a tense standoff in an instant. As the confrontation became heated, Trump and Vance also had an angry ""shouting match"" with Zelenskyy which finally created global headlines. This created dire issues on the diplomatic front between the two countries and also spoiled the agenda of the meeting. Here's a deeper look at his early life, career and net worth.Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelensky is the current and sixth president of Ukraine as of 20th May 2019. He is a comedian and actor with no political background and was a landslide Ukrainian presidential election winner in April 2019. Zelensky possessed no experience of elected office before he ran for the presidency.Zelensky was hailed as an international hero for his bravery and for not leaving as the leader of Ukraine even when Russia invaded the nation in February 2022. His determination not to leave the nation even in times of unrest and his leadership made him a global favorite as a war leader.Zelensky was born on 25 January 1978 in Kryvyi Rih, a Russophone industrial city in south-east Ukraine. His parents were Jewish. As a child, Zelensky was brought up speaking Russian but later became fluent in Ukrainian and English. In 1995, he studied at Kryvyy Rih Economic Institute, one of the faculties of Kyiv National Economic University, and graduated in law in 2000.Zelensky created the TV entertainment production firm Kvartal 95 that produced all of the 1997 blockbusters. He even starred in a few of the films such as Love in the Big City, Office Romance, Our Time, 8 First Dates, I, You, He, She, Svanty, and Paddington. Zelensky played the role of an anti-corruption politician who mysteriously and magically became Ukraine's president in the TV show Servant of the People in 2015. Zelensky's grandfather was a World War II veteran of the Soviet army. He was also a stand-up comedian, screenwriter, and a creative director.The political life of Zelenskyy started in quite a strange way. Having no political experience, he officially announced his presidential candidacy in December 2018 and initially was met with surprise. But his tally of politics and outsider candidate status in a corruption-weary country exhausted from politics unnerved a nerve with the electorate deep. Zelenskyy won the 2019 presidential election outright, taking 73.23% of the vote—a decisive mandate that gave him the biggest margin of victory in Ukrainian history. His success is based on his ability to identify with the populace's outrage over the mainstream politicians and position himself as a change candidate.According to Forbes Middle East, Zelensky's net worth was approximately at $1.4 billion in 2022. Previously, social media and Russian disinformation campaigns falsely accused the Ukrainian president of being a billionaire with over $1 billion in assets.According to Forbes' 36th annual World’s Billionaires List, only seven billionaires remained in the country, and Zelensky was not one of them. Unlike his predecessor, Zelensky was never a billionaire. In 2022, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, his net worth was reportedly estimated at around $20 million at most. Much of Zelensky's fortune has been accumulated from his lucrative entertainment career, where he spent more than 20 years as a producer, actor, and comedian. In 1997, he established Kvartal 95, a comedy troupe that later developed into a prominent production company. Kvartal 95 made blockbuster TV shows, movies, and live tours.Zelenskyy's leadership through the crisis as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine has catapulted him into a globally famous and revered person. His unbending commitment to save Ukraine, his repeated appearance on the front lines, and his success at keeping the country together and optimism high during abject loss have made him an icon. Zelenskyy's on-camera demeanor of a brawler who will fight along with his people, always dressed in military fatigues, is today the face of Ukraine's resistance and refusal to relinquish its sovereignty.","Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy found himself at the center of a bizarre and embarrassing diplomatic blunder after taking a seat in a White House meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance.

King Charles III welcomed Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Sandringham on Monday, as the meeting took place amid controversy over recent remarks by US President Donald Trump suggesting to make Canada 51st state.Trudeau, who traveled to London for an emergency defense summit on Ukraine over the weekend, shook hands with King Charles as they posed for photos at the monarch's royal residence.Prior to his consultation with the King, departing PM Trudeau indicated he would address matters significant to Canadians, including ""standing up for our sovereignty and our independence as a nation"".As the Commonwealth nation's head of state, the King faces pressure to explicitly support Canada against Trump's declarations.Jason Kenney, the former leader of the Canadian province of Alberta, stated on X that the King must follow the Canadian PM's guidance, who ""should ask [Charles] to underscore Canadian sovereignty"".The conservative politician criticised British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, stating he had ""cravenly thrown Canada under the bus"" by avoiding comment on Trump's annexation threats during his recent White House visit.""It was a shameful betrayal of a fellow realm which has made enormous sacrifices for the defence of Britain,"" Kenney said, BBC reported.Trump's new import duties, targeting goods from China, Mexico and Canada, commence on Tuesday. The president aims to safeguard American manufacturing, employment and address trade imbalances.Earlier on Sunday, via Truth Social, Trump had said that America subsidises Canada through product imports. He further claimed that without this financial flow, Canada ""ceases to exist as a viable country"".Trump has discussed using ""economic force"" to incorporate Canada as America's 51st state. He clarified military force wasn't considered - a reassurance absent from his statements about acquiring the Panama Canal and Greenland.The response to Trump's tariff threats and statements about Canadian sovereignty dominates discussions in Trudeau's Liberal Party, as candidates compete for leadership following his January resignation announcement.The King's recent diplomatic engagements, including those related to Ukraine, have increased following Trump's presidential return.Charles also met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at Sandringham to reaffirm Britain's support for Ukraine the previous day. The meetings came just days after Zelenskyy's tense exchange with Trump at the White House on Friday.Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has extended an invitation for Trump to make a state visit to the UK, an unusual gesture given that the former president already received the royal treatment from Queen Elizabeth II during his first term.",King Charles III met with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at Sandringham.

Did Zelenskyy use a cuss word for JD Vance under his breath during White House argument?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-zelenskyy-use-a-cuss-word-for-jd-vance-under-his-breath-during-white-house-argument/articleshow/118648718.cms,"Donald Trump-Zelenskyy meeting turned heads across the world as the leaders clashed on camera.

What did Zelenskyy actually say?



A visibly exasperated Volodymyr Zelenskyy apparently muttered a cuss word at US Vice President JD Vance during the unprecedented argument at the Oval Office, claimed social media users citing a viral video. It is not, however, confirmed whether Zelenskky actually said anything or whether the viral video was a manipulated one. According to social media claims, Zelenskyy called Vance ""cyka"" (suka), which in English translates to b***ch.This apparently happened when JD Vance joined President Donald Trump in berating Zelenskyy and questioned whether he ever thanked Trump for taking the step in mediating the Russia-Ukraine conflict.“I think it’s disrespectful to come into the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media,” Vance said, his voice rising. “You bring people on a propaganda tour, Mr President … Do you think that it’s respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?”“During the war, everyone has problems,” Zelenskyy replied. “But you have nice ocean and don’t feel now. But you will feel it in the future.”“You don’t know that,” Trump interjected angrily. “You don’t know that. Don’t tell us what we’re going to feel.”During the heated argument, Zelenskyy asked JD Vance to come to Ukraine and see what was happening there. Vance said he had been there and seen the stories. It was at that time that the video showed Zelenskyy muttering something.

Lindsey Graham calls on Zelenskyy to resign or change after Trump argument

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Sunday that Senator Lindsey Graham could take Ukrainian citizenship and then call for his resignationZelenskyy made the remark in an interview, a clip of which was shared by Collin Rugg on the social media platform X. He was responding to the senator's statement that he should resign as president.""I can give him Ukrainian citizenship, then his voice can start to gain weight,"" Zelenskyy said. He also said that citizens from other countries telling Ukrainians who should lead Ukraine was undemocratic.Senator Lindsey Graham, once a strong supporter of Ukraine, had told reporters it was unclear whether the US could continue working with Zelenskyy and suggested he should resign.This follows a heated meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy in the White House. Zelenskyy had traveled to Washington to secure a deal giving the US access to Ukraine’s mineral resources. However, the meeting took an unexpected turn, leading to the latter being asked to leave.According to Associated Press, key Republicans and Democrats in Congress have strongly supported Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. However, tensions between Zelenskyy and US President Donald Trump are now putting that support at risk.While Republican backing for Ukraine has declined in the three years since Russia ’s invasion, some leaders had hoped a new deal would strengthen US support for Kyiv.","Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Sunday that Senator Lindsey Graham could take Ukrainian citizenship and then call for his resignation.

Head of FBI's NY field office retires under pressure from Trump admin, sources say

Who is James Dennehy?

James Dennehy, head of the FBI’s New York field office, has announced his retirement after being directed to step down without explanation.His departure follows internal tensions within the bureau, particularly over the Justice Department’s demand for a list of FBI agents involved in the January 6 Capitol riot investigations. The directive has raised fears of widespread dismissals.Dennehy, a retired Marine, was one of the officials who resisted the Justice Department's request. Reports indicate that he was prepared to fight back against what he saw as political interference. In a message to colleagues, he said, “I will never stop defending this joint. I’ll just do it willingly and proudly from outside the wire.”His exit comes amid leadership changes at the FBI. Kash Patel, a close ally of President Donald Trump, recently took over as FBI Director, while conservative commentator Dan Bongino was named Deputy Director.James Dennehy had a long career with the FBI, beginning in 2002 as a special agent in the New York field office, focusing on counterintelligence. He later held key positions at FBI headquarters in Washington, including section chief and chief of staff in the national security branch. He also led counterintelligence and cyber operations in New York before heading the Newark field office.Dennehy was appointed to lead the FBI’s New York field office, one of the agency’s most high-profile divisions, in September 2024 by then-FBI Director Christopher Wray.In his farewell message, Dennehy emphasised the importance of the FBI’s independence, writing, “We will not bend. We will not falter. We will not sacrifice what is right for anything or anyone.”","Head of FBI's NY field office retires under pressure from Trump admin, sources say.

Hegseth orders Pentagon to stop offensive cyberoperations against Russia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hegseth-orders-pentagon-to-stop-offensive-cyberoperations-against-russia/articleshow/118694944.cms,"Secretary of defense Pete Hegseth (File photo)

WASHINGTON: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered US Cyber Command to halt offensive operations against Russia, according to a current official and two former officials briefed on the secret instructions. The move is apparently part of a broader effort to draw President Vladimir Putin of Russia into talks on Ukraine and a new relationship with the United States.Hegseth's instructions, part of a larger reevaluation of all operations against Russia, have not been publicly explained. But they were issued before President Donald Trump 's public blowup in the Oval Office with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday.The precise scope and duration of the Defense Department order is not clear, as the line between offensive and defensive cyberoperations is often a blurry one.Still, retaining access to major Russian networks for espionage purposes is crucial to understanding Putin's intentions as he enters negotiations, and to tracking the arguments within Russia about what conditions to insist upon and what could be given up.Former officials said it was common for civilian leaders to order pauses in military operations during sensitive diplomatic negotiations, to avoid derailing them. Still, for Trump and Hegseth, the retreat from offensive cyberoperations against Russian targets represents a huge gamble.It essentially counts on Putin to reciprocate by letting up on what many call the ""shadow war"" underway against the United States and its traditional allies in Europe. Leading European powers continue to say their support of Ukraine is undiminished even as Trump, who has sought to portray himself as a neutral arbiter in seeking to end the war in Ukraine, has at times sided openly with Putin.US officials have said Russia has continued to try to penetrate US networks, including in the first weeks of the Trump administration. But that is only part of a broader Russian campaign.Over the past year, ransomware attacks on US hospitals, infrastructure and cities have ramped up, many emanating from Russia in what intelligence officials have said are largely criminal acts that have been sanctioned, or ignored, by Russian intelligence agencies.Sabotage efforts in Europe -- including suspected Russian attempts to cut communications cables, mysterious explosions and Russian-directed assassination plots, including against the CEO of Germany's largest arms maker -- have accelerated in the past year. The United States has, until now, been central in helping European nations fight back, often in covert cyberoperations, but that cooperation could now be in jeopardy.Many of those operations are run out of Britain's Government Communications Headquarters -- the storied intelligence agency that broke the Enigma codes in World War II -- and to some extent by Canada. It is possible they will continue that work, while the United States focuses on China, its most sophisticated adversary in cyberspace.Russia also ran an aggressive influence campaign during the last presidential campaign, according to reports by US intelligence agencies during the Biden administration. In recent election cycles, US Cyber Command has conducted secret operations to hamper or curtail those influence efforts.But the Trump administration has begun to dismantle efforts by the FBI and other agencies to warn about Russian propaganda, and the order by the Pentagon would halt, at least for now, any further Cyber Command efforts to interrupt future Russian influence campaigns.Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday described the urgency of getting Russia to the negotiating table over Ukraine, even while acknowledging that it was unclear whether Putin was ready to make a deal.""You're not going to bring them to the table if you're calling them names, if you're being antagonistic,"" Rubio said on ABC's ""This Week."" ""That's just the president's instincts from years and years and years of putting together deals as someone who's in business.""Rubio was not asked about the decision to stop the offensive cyberoperations, but he grew defensive when pressed on why the United States was letting up on pressure on Moscow, to the point of removing language from a United Nations resolution that described Russia as the aggressor in the war in Ukraine. Almost all of the United States' traditional allies voted against the resolution, leaving the Trump administration siding with Russia, North Korea, Iran and Belarus, and a handful of other authoritarian states.""If this was a Democrat that was doing this, everyone would be saying, well, he's on his way to the Nobel Peace Prize,"" Rubio said. ""This is absurd. We are trying to end a war. You cannot end a war unless both sides come to the table, starting with the Russians, and that is the point the president has made. And we have to do whatever we can to try to bring them to the table to see if it's even possible.""The order from Hegseth was first reported by The Record, a cybersecurity publication from Recorded Future, which tracks cyberoperations. The Pentagon and US Cyber Command declined to comment on the record, but a senior defense official, declining to allow use of her name, said that Hegseth had ""no greater priority"" than the safety of military members, including in cyberoperations.After the publication of this article, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement that Trump appeared to be giving Putin ""a free pass as Russia continues to launch cyberoperations and ransomware attacks against critical American infrastructure."" He called the administration's move ""a critical strategic mistake.""As the Trump administration prepared to take office, departing Biden administration officials urged Trump's appointees to keep the pressure on Russia, including by continuing to arm Ukraine and push back on the GRU and the SVR, two Russian intelligence agencies that have been behind some of the most aggressive Russian cyberattacks and espionage operations.",Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered US Cyber Command to halt offensive operations against Russia.

"Pentagon changes name of Georgia Army base back to Fort Benning, dumping Fort Moore",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pentagon-changes-name-of-georgia-army-base-back-to-fort-benning-dumping-fort-moore/articleshow/118694833.cms,"AP photo

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has, for the second time, reversed the renaming of a U.S. military base, saying that Fort Moore in Georgia should revert back to being called Fort Benning .The move reflects an ongoing effort by the Pentagon to overturn the Biden administration's 2023 decision to remove names that honored Confederate leaders, including for nine Army bases. But the drive to revert to the former names means finding service members with the same name as the Confederate leaders.Previously, Fort Benning was named for Brig. Gen. Henry L. Benning, a Confederate officer during the American Civil War who stridently opposed the abolition of slavery.Now, Hegseth said, Fort Benning will be named in honor of Cpl. Fred G. Benning, a recipient of the Distinguished Service Cross who served in France during World War I. According to the Pentagon, Benning was honored for heroic actions in October 1918, when he led troops through heavy fire after his platoon leader was killed by the enemy.The renaming of bases is resulting in decisions that insult the military heroes whose names were selected in the 2023 process, including Lt. Gen. Harold Gregory Moore Jr. and his wife, Julia.Moore is a revered military leader who earned the Distinguished Service Cross for valor and fought in the Battle of Ia Drang in the Vietnam War. And Julia Moore was key to the creation of teams that do in-person notifications of military casualties.Hegseth last month signed an order restoring the name of a North Carolina base back to Fort Bragg , and warned that more changes were coming.The North Carolina base had been renamed Fort Liberty in 2023. Its original namesake, Gen. Braxton Bragg, was a Confederate general from Warrenton, North Carolina, who was known for owning slaves and losing key Civil War battles, contributing to the Confederacy's downfall.Now, Bragg is named to honor Pfc. Roland L. Bragg, who the Army said was a World War II hero who earned a Silver Star and Purple Heart for exceptional courage during the Battle of the Bulge.It's not clear how much the renaming will cost, but the expense comes as the Trump administration is trying to find savings through Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.The Naming Commission in its August 2022 report estimated it would cost $4.9 million to rename Fort Benning as Fort Moore, but said there could be additional costs. It put the cost to rename Bragg at around $8 million. Updated costs were not available.Hegseth said the original Bragg name is a legacy for troops who lived and served there and that it was a shame to change it. And he said he deliberately referred to Bragg and Fort Benning by those names as he entered the Pentagon on his first day in office.""There's a reason I said Bragg and Benning when I walked into the Pentagon on day one. But it's not just Bragg and Benning,"" he said. ""There are a lot of other service members that have connections. And we're going to do our best to restore it.""The lower ranks of the new namesakes indicate the exhaustive research being done by Army and defense leaders to find service members with the same names who have also earned some type of award for their military action and bravery.","Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reversed the renaming of a U.S. military base, saying that Fort Moore in Georgia should revert back to being called Fort Benning.

ISLAMABAD: At least five people were killed and 20 injured in a suicide blast at a mosque of an Islamic religious school known as the “university of jihad” in Nowshera district of Pakistan’s northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province on Friday.Among the dead were Maulana Hamid-ul-Haq Haqqani , head of Dar-ul-Uloom Haqqania school, the seminary in Nowshera’s Akora Khattak town where key Afghan Taliban leaders have studied. Mullah Omer, the slain founder of the Taliban movement in Afghanistan, was also an alumni of this religious school.Graduates of the seminary include current Afghan Taliban leaders Amir Khan Muttaqi, Sirajuddin Haqqani, Abdul Latif Mansoor, Maulvi Ahmad Jan, Mullah Jalaludin Haqani, Maulvi Qalamudin, Arifullah Arif and Mullah Khairullah Khairkhwa.The explosion occurred in the main prayer hall as people gathered for weekly Friday prayers were leaving the mosque.KP police chief Zulfiqar Hameed confirmed that it was a suicide attack and that three policemen were also injured. “More than a dozen police officers were guarding the mosque when the attack occurred, and Haq’s seminary also had its own security,” he said.“It appears that Hamid Haqqani (seminary’s slain chief) was the target,” Hameed added.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack, which came on the last Friday ahead of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.Yawar Zia, a police constable, who was injured in the attack, said he was on security duty at the seminary when the blast happened and splinters hit him. “After offering prayer, Hamid-ul-Haq, accompanied by his guards, was leaving the mosque when the powerful explosion occurred,” the wounded official said.Eyewitnesses described a chaotic scene, with blood and body parts scattered all over the place. They said the casualties could have been much higher had the bomber struck during the prayers.Haqqani, the son of slain prominent Pakistani cleric Sami-ul-Haq Haqqani, known as the “father of Taliban, was a vice-chancellor of the sprawling seminary, located 60 km from the provincial capital of Peshawar. Following his father’s assassination in 2018, he also became chairman of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Sami (JUI-S) political party. He had also previously served as a member of the National Assembly from 2002 to 2007.Haq was also among the few who called on the world and Pakistan to immediately recognise the Taliban govt and establish diplomatic relations with Afghanistan after the fall of Kabul in 2021.Last year, he led a delegation of religious scholars to Afghanistan for “religious diplomacy” meetings with Taliban leaders.His seminary had faced controversy in the past as its students were accused of involvement in the assassination of Pakistan’s former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto. The madrasa, however, denied any connection with the suspects.","At least five people were killed and 20 injured in a suicide blast at a mosque.

Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was alos present during the ceremony.According to a statement by CMSA, both nations will collaborate on selecting and training Pakistani astronauts, with the chosen candidate expected to join Chinese taikonauts for a short-term mission in the coming years.""This signifies a major step in China’s international space cooperation ,"" reported Global Times, highlighting the growing partnership between Beijing and Islamabad in aerospace advancements.China’s space station, which has been operational for nearly four years, was built after the country was reportedly excluded from the International Space Station (ISS) due to concerns over the involvement of China’s military in its space programme.The station is also seen as a new frontier of competition between China and the US.As per the news agency PTI, the agreement further solidifies China’s support for Pakistan’s space ambitions, following previous collaborations such as the launch of Pakistani satellites.Pakistan’s first digital communications satellite, Badr-1, was launched aboard a Chinese Long March 2E rocket in 1990, while earlier this year, Pakistan’s CubeSat accompanied China’s Chang’e-6 probe to the Moon.According to Global Times, the selection of the astronaut is expected to take around a year, after which the candidate will undergo intensive training in China. This move, experts say, demonstrates the reliability of China's manned space technology and its willingness to lower barriers for developing countries to participate in space exploration .China has also set ambitious goals for space exploration, with plans to land astronauts on the Moon before 2030.Meanwhile, the US has its sights set on returning to the lunar surface by 2025.","China has signed an agreement with Pakistan to send a Pakistani astronaut to its space station, Tiangong.

'Cowardly and heinous acts of terrorism': PM Shehbaz Sharif

A top cleric and four worshippers were killed and several injured after a blast ripped through a madrassa Darul Uloom Haqqania located in Pakistan 's Akkora Khattak district, which is in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, according to AP news agency.Emergency responders, Rescue 1122 have arrived at the location, and law enforcement authorities have initiated their investigation into the incident.Abdul Rashid, a district police chief said that the officers are investigating the case.Meanwhile, rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Faizi confirmed to Dawn that 20 people have been injured and have been taken to hospital.The explosion took place during Friday prayers in the madrassa's main hall, with authorities declaring an emergency in Nowshera , as confirmed by Dawn's KP Bureau Chief, Ali Akbar.Speaking to Samaa TV, KP's Inspector General, Zulfiqar Hameed, said, ""It appears to be a suicide blast, as per initial investigations. Some are injured and some are among the martyrs.""""It appears that Maulana Hamidul Haq Haqqani was the target,"" the KP IG told Samaa TV.Maulana Haqqani, who leads JUI-S as its chief, is the firstborn of the late Maulana Samiul Haq. His credentials include being a political figure and Islamic academic, with a tenure in the National Assembly spanning from November 2002 to 2007. Following his father's tragic death, he assumed the roles of vice chancellor at Jamia Darul Uloon Haqqania and chairman of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (Sami).The madressah was established by Islamic scholar Maulana Abdul Haq Haqqani in September 1947, according to the institution's website.Previously, the Madrassa faced scrutiny when its students were alleged to be involved in former prime minister Benazir Bhutto's assassination. However, the madrassa has consistently denied any links to the suspects.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif issued a firm condemnation of the incident and offered prayers for Maulana Haq and other casualties' recovery, as stated by the Prime Minister's Office.He instructed authorities to provide excellent medical care to the wounded individuals and requested a detailed incident report.""Such cowardly and heinous acts of terrorism cannot dampen our resolve against terrorism,"" the PM said.

Why is Pakistan expelling Afghan refugees?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/why-is-pakistan-expelling-afghan-refugees/articleshow/118572905.cms,"(ANI photo)

Clock running out for refugees in Islamabad, Rawalpindi



'We've worked with the Americans for years'



Kabul, Islamabad row amid rising crackdown



Forced to move after decades in Pakistan



UN says Pakistan has a tradition of protecting Afghans

A woman who we will call Fatima fled Afghanistan with her family in December 2021. She had worked for an American non-profit organization in Kabul ­until the US pullout in the summer of 2021, when the Taliban retook control of the country.She is now based in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad. And she is in trouble. Her Pakistani visa is days away from expiring, and the authorities are still processing her renewal application.""I am concerned about the renewal of my visa, and if not renewed timely authorities would arrest me and my family for illegally residing in the country,"" Fatima told DW.Police, including female officers, recently conducted a raid on a building where Fatima lives, looking for undocumented Afghan refugees. She was not in the building at the time, but her brother ended up in custody.""Later, we showed them our visa renewal application receipts and proof but police did not cooperate,"" said Fatima, who is now hiding from the authorities.In 2023, Pakistan started a massive initiative to repatriate approximately 4 million Afghans who have entered the country over the past 40 years. And while the authorities granted some leeway last year, Pakistan's government has now set a March 31 deadline to expel foreign nationals residing in the country illegally, with search operations ongoing in January and February.Afghan refugees living in Islamabad and the nearby city of Rawalpindi ""have been verbally asked to leave Pakistan till 28th February,"" Umer Gillani, a legal expert and rights activist, told DW.Moniza Kakar, a lawyer working for refugees advocacy in Pakistan, said there was ""uncertainty and fear"" among the Afghani nationals in the area.""Since the start of this year, over 1,000 Afghans have been detained in Islamabad, and more than 18,000 have been forced to leave Islamabad and Rawalpindi because of government orders,"" she said.Amin, 28, is from Kabul. He spent years collaborating with the United States in the fight against the Taliban in Afghanistan, before he too had to flee across the Pakistani border.Hee said he was just days away from being evacuated to America, but this was put on hold last month with President Donald Trump signing an executive order to suspend a refugee resettlement program.Nearly 20,000 Afghans are presently waiting in Pakistan for approval to resettle in the US through an American government program.""We've worked with the Americans for years, we helped and supported them in Afghanistan, we have given them a part of our lives and they have to support us so that we can live peacefully,"" Amin told DW.Over the last three years, Pakistan's relationship with neighboring Afghanistan has deteriorated. Islamabad holds the Taliban authorities in Afghanistan responsible for their inability to control the operations of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group that formed in 2007 and has conducted numerous attacks on Pakistani security forces.As cross-border tensions with the Taliban regime escalate, concerns were also raised about the well-being of Afghans in Pakistan amid reports of purported intimidation and arrests. The UN special rapporteur has expressed his worries, stating that Afghans in the area deserve more humane treatment.Activist Gilani said millions of Afghan refugees in Pakistan are being used as ""hostages to build pressure whenever there is tension between the two countries.""Last week, Pakistan's Foreign Ministry dismissed claims made by the Afghan representation regarding the mistreatment of Afghan refugees in Pakistan, labeling these allegations as ""misplaced"" and urging Kabul to facilitate the smooth repatriation of Afghan citizens.Pakistan has accommodated hundreds of thousands of refugees from its northern neighbor, a situation resulting from decades of regional instability. Afghans who arrived in Pakistan following the Taliban takeover in August 2021 have been relying on visa renewals to stay in the country, a procedure that is costly, uncertain and often subject to significant delays.""The stories of refugees are devastating. Families who have lived in Pakistan for years, even decades, are now being uprooted due to tensions between the two countries. Children, women, and men who have already suffered so much are being treated as if they don't matter. This is not just a refugee crisis, it's a humanitarian crisis,"" said Kakar.UNHCR's top representative in Pakistan, Philippa Candler, told DW that Pakistan already repatriated over 800,000 Afghan refugees between September 2023 and the end of last year.""As of December 2024, Pakistan hosted over 2.8 million Afghans with 69% of refugees living outside refugee villages,"" she said.Candler acknowledged Pakistan's generosity in hosting Afghan refugees for decades, and the current ""economic and security challenges"" in Pakistan that drive the repatriation efforts.At the same time, UNHCR was urging the Islamabad government to ""see the situation of Afghans through a humanitarian perspective"" and ""continue its long-standing tradition of protecting vulnerable Afghans […] regardless of their status.""""It's essential that we work hand-in-hand with both host countries and countries of origin to develop mechanisms that empower refugees to rebuild their lives in safety and dignity, including voluntary repatriation,"" she said.""We are calling for dialogue between the two countries, and for the refugee issue to be separated from political matters.""","Afghan refugees living in Islamabad and the nearby city of Rawalpindi are in trouble. Pakistan's government has now set a March 31 deadline to expel foreign nationals residing in the country illegally. Nearly 20,000 Afghans are waiting in Pakistan for approval to resettle in the US through an American government program.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118572997,imgsize-927785,width-400,resizemode-4/118572997.jpg"
